B00192KCQ0|4.0|I've taken an almost inordinate amount of time to let this album linger, as much to get the deluge of reviews out of the way as anything else. Not that I'll have anything new or insightful to offer outside simply another opinion, but humor me. Oh and also time taken to learn the record just a bit, of course, a luxury not afforded to paid reviewers. And in the weeks following the release of Metallica's Death Magnetic it's been a hailstorm of buzz, of which only a portion is due to the distortion in your headphones. (rim shot) For the most part the album has been well-received, the most scathing and pointed comments usually directed at the quality of the final mix. I'm simply going to ignore this aspect and not because it's unimportant (as I both possess and prefer the more soothing Guitar Hero III mix myself), but because it's been talked about to death by people far more knowledgeable of, interested in, and affected by this aspect than myself. I simply recommend you procure for yourself a GH3 copy (as it's called) and save yourself the aggravation up front so you can get onto the songs, which is what I plan to do.    Well this album really had the potential to be a train wreck. You know in some ways it was a bit like the Palin-Biden debate where Gov. Palin had set the bar so low in the previous weeks that anything short of putting a gun in her mouth and blowing her brains all over Senator Biden and Gwen Ifill on national TV might be construed as a bit of a victory. So too had Metallica set the bar down a notch or ten in the minds of many. (I apologize to the seven or so folks still madly smitten with St. Anger). It's my opinion that outside some confident charm, and not my kind of charm at that, Palin still failed miserably despite not managing to implode. Question remained, would Metallica's latest effort similarly be equal parts improvement while still remaining mostly substance less?     Thankfully, no.    Let's immediately throw out the historic comparisons, shall we? No, it's not Master Of Puppets. It can never and will never be a record of historical importance on that level. That ship sailed in '86 and was miles at sea even just a couple years later. It can be said for most bands lucky enough to survive into a third decade that the expiration date on their continued impact and relevance (if a band is lucky enough to have the latter...some don't) has probably expired. That's not a knock, it simply...is. Few bands are able to constantly reinvent themselves so as to be the impetus behind movement after movement. In fact, I can't think of a single band that's managed to do that past about 8 years, let alone 25. So what we're left with are a lot of bands who continue to do what they do with varying degrees of success or not, both in terms of sales (an antiquated notion) and fan satisfaction (much more palpable) for as long as they can. You really have to put yourself in the mindset of getting past that direct comparison mode because it's both ridiculous and irrelevant, as well as a complete disservice to the music. Doing so only sets up a band and another album for failure after failure. In that case, Rush, Iron Maiden, Metallica...they're all failures. And yet, clearly they're not.    In my mind, music is more rightly observed as an evolutionary process rather than one of direct comparison anyhow. You don't judge Van Gogh by how the next painting compares to The Starry Night. Or if Picasso's Rose Period lived up to his Blue Period and how much of a success or failure one is relative to the other. It is a success or failure unto itself, which is, of course, also subjective. Snobs will tell you there is a quantifiable precedent, but I don't prescribe to that notion.    Death Magnetic finally veers the Metallica ship (Hindenburg?) away from electrical storm clouds after the tumultuous event that was and surrounded St. Anger. Necessary as that album might've been towards getting the band from that point to this, it was at bestinconsistent and at its worst, directionless, poorly constructed, meandering, self-important, and in places downright awful. The two albums (and thirteen years) preceding St. Anger were both the height of Metallica experimenting and breaking their own mold, to mixed success and, unarguably, mixed fan reaction as well. If you're so inclined to criticize the band for their 1991 self-titled release for spawning hit singles and popularity unprecedented for a thrash metal band, you have to go back to 1988 to find the band resembling \\"their old selves.\\" Well the new album definitely is a return home of sorts, blending the speed and energy of ...And Justice For All with some of the plod and melody of \\"The Black Album,\\" all while managing to be in-the-moment too.     There are also other eras of Metallica present here. The dry vocals by Hetfield (I'd have liked some reverb myself) are indeed tonally reminiscent of the band's dubious last go `round, although it's safe to say there's a lot more intestinal fortitude and a lot less cringe-inducing emotional whine (re: chorus of Invisible Kid). You'll also hear remnants of Load-era melody or chug and some catchy melodies that bring \\"The Black Album\\" to mind. I think the biggest difference is that there's a much-needed sense of urgency in the new songs than most of what's come lately (and with Metallica, \\"lately\\" means the last 17 or so years, suggesting they work on God's clock instead of normal time). Many of the songs on Load and Reload are high on atmosphere, but low on energy because they're intentionally deliberate and, clearly, the band was experimenting at this point. Some of St. Anger is high on verve at times, but there's also a tendency to plod and aimlessly riff in a murky soup of drop C-tuning that offers little in the way of coherent or vibrant transitions between bits and pieces.    Like an effective film experience, the story in music is often told in the editing process. It's about the marriage of imagery and movement and how those things correlate and weave in and out of one another. You don't linger too long on any one shot. You create tension and atmosphere though movement and inter-cutting. I think that's been one of Metallica's weakest links the last few albums; knowing what's good and what isn't, and how to maneuver within that. The result has been a lot of wankery.     That's a problem they've mostly corrected on Death Magnetic.    There's a lot of music in these ten songs and at first it seems a bit overwhelming, but after a few listens, the pieces make good sense and, better still, the songs flow well, despite their muscular running times. You begin to anticipate the change and realize the coming riff. You might argue there are a bit too many transitions and musical cues abounding at times (thus the album's most notable similarity to 88's Justice LP), and if the songs have a slight fault it might be that there's a bit over-indulging going on in spots, but overall there's a coherency that's married to the energy and it works well, so that's a small distraction I can easily live with. The songs are journeys, mini-epics with discernable beginnings, middles and endings. They have transitory elements that make sense and, yes, guitar solos to help accomplish this.     The songs simply move and while that sounds fundamental, I can't say that about a lot of the songs from the previous three albums.    It doesn't take long to realize, too, that there's a concerted effort to get back to the riffage and speed that dominated earlier albums. Don't be mistaken, this isn't Ride The Lightning II here, but the supple-wristed Hetfield has some fine flashes we haven't heard for some time on songs like All Nightmare Long, which, to me, harkens back to Puppets-era writing, execution and skull-thumping delivery. Thrashier numbers like the bookend opening and closing tracks have a raw punk-metal flavor to them, not unlike the verve found on their debut album. I wouldn't call this mimicrythough. This is clearly 2008 Metallica having fun tapping old veins with the best and - let's face it -- most smile-evoking intentions.     Sure there are the more cynical fans who see this as the band desperately trying to be 20-years-old again, feebly trying to garner lost respect by saying \\"we can still play fast, see?\\" I don't get this impression at all because I don't think that urge ever left the band. I think, rather, Metallica spent nearly 20 years doing something else, evolving as I mentioned earlier. That doesn't mean it's necessarily successful growth, because that comes down to taste, but it is something they deemed necessary at the time, for better or worse. To return to their roots to me isn't some kind of self-denial or denial of growth, but instead it reads as a band coming to terms with and embracing its past. But to some who loved the early days and fought the change as it happened, it might be an attempt at feeble apology. To some of the newer fans, it might be a Neandrathalic and unnecessary step backward. To most everyone else it might best described as a proper melding of all eras of the band, which is how I hear it.    \\"The Black Album,\\" for instance, is here, present in the most literal sense with the inclusion of The Unforgiven III, but also in terms of the string section, vocal melody with the heavy verse - soft chorus formula established with the first Unforgiven entry, etc. It's felt on a song like Broken, Beat & Scarred with the middle eastern flavored riffing, as well as in the infectious choral melodies and relentless chuggings of tunes like Cyanide and The Judas Kiss. ...And Justice For All rings true in the complex arrangements and lengths of many songs, as well as the welcomed-return to many of the dual-guitar harmonies present on that record. The middle break in the instrumental song Suicide And Redemption has a true Justice feel to it.     And so it goes.    It's a rather unpleasant position Metallica find themselves in. Not so much from their insulated perspective, but really from the fan's perspective, watching both critics and other fans lend their take on Death Magnetic. It's a position that they've put themselves in, having spent enough time doing their own thing that they've managed to infuriate and isolate one part of their fan base while gaining a whole new crowd altogether. Most of the rest bob around somewhere between pleased and disappointed, having the opportunity to be one or the other only about every five years or so, the dreadfully-prolonged pause between albums being perhaps the biggest sticking point of all. What you're left with is a bickering assortment of fans eager to pounce on whatever turn they take at this point. On one hand the band experiments more and people cry, \\"Why can't they just do music like they used to?\\" Tread too far back into the past and it's condemned as being pathetic mimicry.    In the vast pool that is \\"can't please everyone\\" comes Death Magnetic, which is nothing short of an energetic, enthused, competent and invigorated return to the spirit that previously compelled them. Nothing will ever be Master Of Puppets and nothing should ever have to be, nor could it. But what is past is also prologue and Death Magnetic seems more the beginning of a new chapter of self-discovery than a nostalgic thumbing through of faded memories and dusty picture albums.    4.5 stars of 5

If the reader is not familiar with the terminology it can slow them down a little, otherwise the book flows well through the subject. It makes the point that what we think is reflected in our bodies, and if we pay attention to our what our bodies are telling us, we can rethink our thoughts. Retrain our cells by rethinking our beliefs and our physical and mental health will improve and so our perspective on our experiences. Encouraging and enlightening.
B0018OAPAW|4.0|My Offspring education started with Conspiracy of One, when I was 13, I went out and bought that cd along with Blink 182's Mark Tom and Travis Show. Now, I still hold a soft spot for the Offspring.    After Conspiracy of One, I moved on to their huge previously released Americana CD. Looking back, that CD is some what boring and overrated, but I was too young to really care. Then I eventually went even farther back to Ignition and Smash, and realized that this is where the true best Offspring can be found.    I would like to review each track on Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace as follows:    1. Half-Truism: If there is one thing Offspring are known for, it is usually a solid opening track to really get the mood going. While this song doesn't really have anything out of the ordinary like a voice over or anything like that, it is one hell of a solid opener. I can already say I am impressed by Dexter's vocal range on this song. I highly recommend this track.    2. Trust In You: This song sounds very much like an Ixnay on the Hombre era track. It really reminds me of All I want or The Meaning of Life. It's rather simply musically structured and quite catchy. It almost feels out of place with the newer sound the Offspring have on other tracks, but bringing back memories of old Offspring is never a bad thing. Again, highly recommended.    3. You're Gonna Go Far, Kid: This song, which is the second single, is very catchy and has gread lyrics. You will catch yourself singing these lyrics, or at the very least tapping your foot to the beat. The only beef I have with this song is that it sounds like a mash up of some other songs. What I mean is that the opening rhythm sounds exactly like Stop by Against Me! and the part when Dexter sings: \\"nice work you did, you're going to go far kid\\" it kind of sounds like a Muse song or something along those lines. I really like this song though, and the different sounds go together very well. Again, highly recommended.    4. Hammerhead: Thefirst single, this song seems to have a lot of different parts to it, the opening, the majority of the song, and then the middle bit all have a distinct sound. The middle part is a little silly, \\"Bang bang it hammers in my head\\" is admittedly a little childish, and I can say that from personal experience it has turned people off the song. Other than that, it takes a while to grow on you, and it might not have been the best song to market the CD with as the first single. I can just recommend this one.    5. A Lot Like Me: This song is again kind of similar to older Offspring. It starts kind of quieter and builds up to the climax at the end of the song. I'm not going to lie, I don't really follow the lyrics of this one, but with lines like \\"because he looks a lot like me\\" I'm not exactly sure what is going on. I think the highlight of this song is when Dexter chants: \\"Want it You got it You're sorry You bought it You're sliding Want it You got it You're sorry You bought it Can't hide it\\" Other than that, this song is pretty good, but not great. I recommend it though.    6. Takes Me Nowhere: This is the final song that sounds more like older Offspring. It doesn't have any super redeeming qualities but it is catchy, and worth a listen. Recommended.    7. Kristy, Are You Doing Okay?: I have to admit, I am not a fan of slower ballad type songs, especially done by a band like the Offspring. It is nice that they try something a little different but not like this. The song has to do about the singer (I say this because I doubt it is Dexter himself) realizing he wasn't there to support a Kristy when she was younger and being abused or something along those lines. It just comes off too whiny and uninspired. I really cannot recommend this song at all.    8. Nothingtown: This is the first of two songs where it seems like a case of stolen identity. This song and the upcoming Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom sound to me like they belong on a Motion City Soundtrack CD more than an Offspring CD. That is not to say they aren't good songs, but they are really poppy. They sound more like Americana songs, and I can only really recommend them to fans of that CD or Conspiracy of One.    9. Stuff Is Messed Up: Now here's what I'm talking about. This song is my favourite song on the CD by far. It's a lot of fun and who can't agree with the line \\"I don't know much, but I know this, **** is ****ed up!\\" It just fits well. This is the Offspring doing pop music with their own flavour, kind of like the song Americana or Why Don't You Get A Job. The song talks about how dumbed down culture is and how much bull**** their is going on in the world today. Dexter sarcastically sings about the media, sex, and corruption among a large list of other things. The giant list in the middle is the best part of the song. Very highly recommended, and it comes with bonus social commentary.    10. Fix You: Again with the slower ballad type songs. Although this song isn't as silly or over dramatic. It displays a nice range of Dexter's vocals as he starts our quietly and builds to \\"I wish I could fix you, and I wish you could fix me.\\" This song actually works for its purpose. This is how they should do a lighter song. It kind of reminds me of She's Got Issues from Americana. It works, but like I said I'm not a huge fan of these songs. Recommended only for those who like the slower lighter songs.    11. Let's Hear It For Rock Bottom: Please see my review of Nothingtown. The one thing I have to note is that the build up to the chorus almost sounds like ska or a tiny bit of reggae. But the chorus is much more pop-rock orientated.    12. Rise and Fall: This song is a great song to wrap up the CD. It's very poppy but it works better than the previous two songs that are similar, Nothingtown and Let's Hear It... It starts and finishes strong, is very catchy throughout and where as the other two seemed out of place, this song has Offspring written all over it. From the chorus to the guitar solo in the middle. I think it is a strong track to end with, and I highly recommend it.    To finish off this review, this CD is more orientated toward the Americana and Conspiracy of One crowd, but come on, you knew you weren't going to get Smash coming into this CD. It has some songs that will remind you of the old Offspring, and it is their best album since Smash in my opinion. Remembering I still need to listen to Splinter. Maybe I will review that next. Pleas visit my blog for more reviews, cjamc.blogspot.com.     Thanks for reading.
B00003CY6M|4.0|Call me a wide-eyed ninny, but I bought into the film's premise. SERENDIPITY isn't a romantic comedy as much as it is a fantasy romantic comedy, and how much you like this film will depend in part on how much of a cynic or a dreamer you are. Me, I'm the wide-eyed ninny.<br /><br />The story is about two people, Jonathan and Sara, who meet - and fall for each other - during one perfect New York evening five days before Christmas, but then decide to leave love to fate. If they meet again, then it was meant to be. But it doesn't pan out, and Jonathan and Sara are gone, just like that, from each other's lives. Cut to several years later, and the two are engaged, but not to each other. Still, echoes of that one enchanted night linger. And Jonathan and Sara, now separated by opposite coasts, decide to make one last-ditch effort to find fate...<br /><br />SERENDIPITY is a fluffy, feel-good, head-in-the-clouds romance. It doesn't seek to impart lessons, although you do learn the one thing the Greeks ask when someone has passed on. It's a comedy, and with the likes of John Cusack, Jeremy Piven, and scene-stealer Eugene Levy gracing the screen, it's a good comedy, with several standout, laugh-out-loud gems. Plot wise, it's not that multi-layered. Basically, for most of the film, Cusack desperately chases down clues to Beckinsale's identity and Beckinsale, after stressing out about her engagement, finally opens herself up to chance and to serendipity. There are many moments where they barely miss each other or unknowingly find a connection to each other.<br /><br />The deal breaker, of course, is that the film does ask that you soak in coincidence after coincidence (or near coincidence, more like), with that five dollar bill being perhaps the most far fetched gimmick used. The film requires two intelligent, believable leads to make the implausible premise work, to be these two characters who realize that what they're doing is totally ridiculous, but, hey, they're caught out in love, and there's nothing to do but go ahead and chase the moon. John Cusack, pretty much today's consensus go-to guy whenever an everyman lead role needs to be cast, is a no-brainer. He's a natural actor, and a fantastic re-actor. Kate Beckinsale, heartachingly beautiful and classy and British, lights up the screen with Cusack. And did I mention that she's heartachingly beautiful? (I think we should forgive her for PEARL HARBOR.) For those who haven't seen this movie yet, there's a bit of [[ASIN:B0000AOV4I Sleepless in Seattle (10th Anniversary Edition)]] going on here, as Jonathan and Sara, after the first 18 minutes of the movie, don't appear together until the end of the movie. Cusack and Beckinsale are so good together that we can't help but root for them.<br /><br />Cusack and Piven demonstrate a different kind of chemistry, as well as impeccable timing, in their scenes together. Apparently, according to the director's audio commentary, Piven's supporting role wasn't going to be that large, but then Piven's skills came into play. His character is that of a glib-talking obituary writer for the New York Times, and I kind of feel that more funny could've been squeezed out from the obit writer angle. For whatever it's worth, Piven delivers one of the funniest Best Man's speeches ever put to cinema.<br /><br />There's an old-fashioned feel to SERENDIPITY, partly because of the classic New York backdrop and partly because Cusack and Beckinsale simply exude a timeless charisma; I believe that they would've done well in any era in motion pictures. Throw in that part of the movie takes place over the holiday season, lending an even more sentimental vibe to the story. And then there's the pitch-perfect movie score and soundtrack to underscore the story and acting. Meanwhile, time lapse photography is well used to denote not only the passage of time but to also infuse energy into the scenes. As well, the director points out, this device allows us a deeper glimpse into what the characters are feeling (as exemplified in Sara's flight to New York).<br /><br />One nice thing the movie does is to not depict Jonathan and Sara's respective intendeds as unlikable characters. Not only would that have been too easy an out, but it would've cheapened Jonathan and Sara's romance. As it is, we end up with a very good but bittersweet moment between Jonathan and his fiancee, played by Bridget Moynahan. I liked that Bridget's character is lovely and loving, and that the only thing wrong with her is that she isn't Sara.<br /><br />And then there's Lars, Sara's fiance. Another sample of the film's sometimes whimsical leanings is that Lars is a New Age Yanni-type  musician. John Corbett plays him quite seriously, which somehow makes Lars an even funnier character. Lars seems to be a nice guy.<br /><br />The pragmatist in me argues that there's no such thing as a fortunate accident, no such thing as serendipity. That you can't count on it, anyway. But, in watching movies, of course you're allowed to dwell in fantasies, momentarily. Now and then, you can simply cave in to the story, especially when the actors are this good. Even when, yes, the coincidences seem too labored. SERENDIPITY is a fluffy, feel-good, head-in-the-clouds romance. I happen to find it irresistible.<br /><br />Lastly, the movie made me want to look up Gabriel Garcia Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera (okay, so mostly I can flip to the first page).hat the characters are feeling (as exemplified in Sara's flight to New York).<br /><br />One nice thing the movie does is to not depict Jonathan and Sara's respective intendeds as unlikable characters.

B001DDBCUU|4.0|The series was a lot of fun, however it was not allways that easy to take on many levels. The movie has succeeded in making the whole concept more balanced. It is surprising indeed to see what was the quitessential TV series actually be somewhat better than its original source. The characters are as is said somewhare more mature and while they still have the same obsessions they are more well-rounded off. The story-line continues what went on before and in addition to the girls we get the usual side-kicks such as Mr Big. What strokes of course is the somewhat too extreme glamourous way they dress: this strokes you at the beginning of the movie but afterwards it comes off quite naturally and creates also a very beautiful viewing experience. There are also not as many vulgar moments as there were in the series which is extremely surprising and wellcome but this also contributes to making the movie a success. The bonus disc is fun with an interveiw with Sarah Jessica Parker as well as a documentary on the fashion we see in the movie. Overall quite fun.
B000U7169M|3.0|Hilary Swank downgrades her usually solid selection of films with \\"The Reaping.\\"  It's a run-of-the-mill plague-ridden spooker that's not that spooky at all.<br /><br />The story is set in the backwoods of Louisiana (a recent trend thanks to perks offered by the state film commission) where a former missionary-turned-LSU professor/skeptic/debunker (Swank) is called upon to investigate strange happenings in the tiny town of Haven.  With her student assistant in tow, Swank sets out to find scientific explanations for the plague-like occurrences in the small town.<br /><br />What she finds is a close-knit community who believes that all of their problems are the cause of a Satan-worshipping little girl (AnnaSophia Robb).  From there, Swank and company encounter more plagues while they try to put a stop to the Robb.  As the story plays out, however, Swank begins to question the members of the community as well as her once-lost faith.  Who should she believe?  Who can she trust?  And exactly what is that tenth plague again?<br /><br />Overall, this snoozer is a step above most SciFi channel flicks, but it probably would have had a better run if it was released directly to DVD instead of on the big screen.  As others have stated, the film's plot unravels as the conclusion gets near.  If you enjoy thrillers and myteries that mix the Bible with creepy townsfolk, \\"The Reaping\\" is a sufficient rainy-day rental.

Although part 3 which was an unrelated film was a nice and different experiment while it lasted, i think this one did a good job of ignorning parts 3 to 6 like it was intended. Produced by Kevin Williamson of \\"Scream\\" fame, this thrilling sequel delivers all the goods with fine kills and great acting by Harnett and Curtis, this should have been the final movie of the series as intended but instead got ruined by \\"Halloween Resurrection\\".<br /><br />This DVD has great picture and sound with a few decent extras like a featuette, trivia game and music video.
0553381687|5.0|I give this book five stars!<br /><br />I read this novel a few years ago and just finished the second book, a Clash of Kings recently. It took me a while to finish A Clash of Kings, compared to A Game of Thrones. I found this book to be original and I took to it very easily. When I started the second book, it started off harder to read as compared to A Game of Thrones, but I am glad I went on and finsihed A Clash of Kings, it was worth the time and effort.<br /><br />I find myself supporting the Stark House in the series. At the end of A Game of Thrones I found myself liking and feeling sorry for Arya, so that helped me read through A Clash of Kings because I wanted to see what would be come of her. While doing that, I found myself liking Bran and Jon Snow. So now I just started reading A Storm of Swords, to find out what happens to these characters.<br /><br />Tyrion is also another character I like in the series, he stands out from the Lannister clan and I think that is one of the reasons I like him.<br /><br />I recommend this book, Martin is really developing quite a story and I can not wait til I read the last chapter of the last book. The books can be hard to follow, due to the POV way he writes, because there really is no connecting of events so see how things are progressing. So I read Wiki articles and that helps unite everything. That also has helped me get through the series, thus far.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Most definately a finely-crafted soundtrack; Hanz Zimmer delivers yet again.  The music covers so much... exciting suspense, then dark and secretive.  Some of it is a bit odd, but most of the soundtrack fits perfectly with the theme of the movie.
0425170349|5.0|This book sticks with you, every now and then, a segment of this book will flash in my mind and I have to stop and think where did i read that from and sometimes it comes from Rainbow Six.    What makes this such a good book is the games that followed it. Rainbow Six Las Vegas is one of my favorite games, and one of the reasons for that is because Rainbow Six was such a good book.    This book is led by John Clark and not by Jack Ryan and Clark delivers this book. The opening of this book is one of the best openers of the Clancy novels. The opening tells and sets the setting of the rest of the book.    John Clark and Ding Chavez are in an airplane that is about to be taken over by terrorist and these two take out the terrorist very easily. It sets the pace of the entire book, one of non-stop action and rescue.     Clancy shows that such people as Clark and Chavez are needed in this world to stop terrorist and terrorism. Clancy's books tend to tell a story that reflects modern day life and in the age of terrorism and before 9/11 this book was somewhat prophetic on what was/is needed to deal with terrorism.    Clancy delivers in this novel.
0375424474|4.0|This is a somewhat breezy overview of the deep links between humans and all other animals that have lived on earth, including not merely fish but worms, jellyfish and even the earliest one-celled creatures. Choosing different aspects of the human body (e. g. hands, heads, sense of smell, hearing, vision etc) Shubin describes how they developed from features present in ancient forms. The earlier forms often served quite different functions but were modified over eons of time in ways quite traceable through the fossil record or DNA. Indeed one of Shubin's main points is that the ancient forms were not replaced but were virtually endlessly modified over time to assume and support (often awkwardly) new functions and support different ways of life. The bodies of living animals (including humans) are thus in many respects Rube Goldberg devices, jury rigged amalgams of various parts, many of which originally served far different purposes.    Shubin writes clearly and with obvious enthusiasm for his subject. The book is short and is an overview intended for a general audience. It does not presume any scientific background nor does it present detailed argument or evidence for its positions. It is not aimed at those who are familiar with the field. There is a subtext against intelligent design, but this position is never explicitly articulated much less argued. It is present only in the implications that follow from Shubin pointing out how many of the modern forms fit their current functions clumsily. The drawings in the book, unfortunately, are only sometimes helpful. The book also has fairly extensive suggestions for further reading. Overall a very good, and very basic, work of popular biology.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This political documentary is a manifesto against private medical care in the US and for universal free health care, what some have called socialized medicine. Michael Moore thus compares the US system based on the full exclusion of 50 millions Americans from health care and the partial exclusion of million more under the title of denial, the denial of one particular treatment to specific Americans by their own private insurance companies, a denial that can go as far as a full rejection of the client by the insurance company and the cancellation of their contracts and all benefits. To make his point he follows the cases of quite a few people in the US who suffered these \\"ailments\\" or \\"ills\\" of the US health system. Some people dying because of these denials, even infants, some people living in total discomfort, poverty, dependence even, because of the bills that ate up their homes, savings, and all other amenities they may have had before getting sick. Then he compares with the systems in four countries: Canada, Great Britain, France and Cuba. All of them have a globally free universal system where only some marginal costs are charged, at most. The  verdict is obvious. To emphasize the Cuban episode he compares with the care the prisoners in Guantanamo get (free top notch medical care) and the care some rescue workers at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks get in the US, and the care they managed to get, for free in Havana from Cuban doctors. The verdict once again does not stand the slightest possibility to appeal. This film though has a shortcoming. He notes the flat rate of a prescription in England (about ten dollars) but does not wonder why it exists. He speaks of a 100% free medical care in France and neglects some side charges. He is probably right with Canada and Great Britain, and definitely with Cuba, when speaking of a state system. But he is under a wrong impression as for France where the health system is not paid by the state but by contributions paid by working people on their salaries and this money is used to reimburse the medical expenses of people up to a certain point and managed by elected councilors representing the workers and employers equally and chosen by their electors on union lists from the trade unions or the employers' unions. The state only intervenes for the people who do not work through subsidies or contributions to the \\"social security authority\\" to compensate for the contributions these people do not pay. And what's more about 30% of medical expenses are covered by cooperative, or private, insurances that everyone is supposed, if so is their choice, to get and to whom they pay premiums that are at times higher than the basic contributions. It is a complex system. But Michael Moore does not explore the easy abuse these systems are the victims of from some people who are inconsiderate in overusing medical assistance or care. In England they introduced a flat payment per prescription to encourage economy on drugs. In France a small part of doctors' fees and prescriptions is not covered at all, even by the cooperative or private complementary insurance companies, by decision of the state in an attempt to curb down expenses and particularly abusive expenses. For instance in France brand name drugs that have an equivalent generic, and cheaper, version on the market are only reimbursed on the basis of this generic drug's price. But altogether Michael Moore's discourse is true and right, when we keep in mind that we have to think of the people who always try to get undue or abusive advantage of a generous system, and that we have to consider being economical with drugs and treatment because it is also a syndrome of our advanced stressful societies that many people, and at times those who are least stressed, look for some medical care when none is needed and they use a lot of time of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel for no reason at all except getting some attention. Finally let's keep inmind too that any system, private or public produces a bureaucracy and then a wasteful exploitation of an economic niche in society. This is an important shortcoming of the film: how much money is wasted by private insurance companies in the US to employ people, at times highly paid people, just to deny services to clients, and patients, and how much money is wasted on law suits by clients who are dissatisfied or on damages paid by the insurance companies when they lose these lawsuits? That would vastly account for the denial procedure that has to bring in a profit after paying for the expenses it incurs, money that could be used paying for hospital bills or doctors' fees.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesmind too that any system, private or public produces a bureaucracy and then a wasteful exploitation of an economic niche in society.

0061537934|5.0|I am a dog lover, have three so that kind of proves it, and the fact that this book was narated by the dog \\"Enzo\\" locked the sale for me.  I was in a small boutique bookstore owned by a friend of a friend in Sun River, Oregon, and wanted to spend some money to help them out.  I love to read - really do, but life and work gets in the way and I find it hard to indulge in a good book when my laptop sits so close by buzzing away with the constant chimes of \\"new mail\\" coming in.  So, I don't read as often as I would like to, but this book grabbed me. The writing is beautiful, engaging and I have thought about the hidden messages in this book for the last three days.  I finished the book tonight after work, torn between doing my nightly chores, or finishing the last three chapters of this book.  I honestly did not want the book to end.  Can't wait to read more from this author.  I am hooked.  This is an awesome read and I will recommend this to all of my friends.  Take the time to read this one, you won't regret it.
B001C08RHA|5.0|In a decade of interchangable superhero movies desperately trying to enter the Superhero Pantheon, Iron Man is the only one that succeeds in breaking the wanna-be mold and becomes truly fresh and worthwhile. It mixes just the right amount of real world injustice and superhero magic.     The movie never takes itself to seriously and so never becomes too heavy handed or bogged down in psychology. It never becomes too slapstick, and Downey Jr.'s remarkable performance brings to life both the bitterness that makes Tony Stark a believable human being and the fortitude that leads him to make himself into Iron Man.     Stark doesn't care what anyone thinks of him; he's a playboy/weapons mogul who fights injustice because it offends him personally and follows the rules of no other superhero code. Iron Man, too, follows the rules of no other superhero movie; it leaves the impression that the filmmakers did it solely to please themselves, disregarding what the studio or fanboy expect and \\"Iron Man movie\\" to be.     And that's what makes it great. Now if only they could continue to ignore precedent and continue the stellar work in the inevitable sequel.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|For me, a new ENIGMA album is a \\"must-buy.\\"  Admittedly though, I can't listen only once through an ENIGMA album and make a final judgment.  Nearly every ENIGMA release has taken some time to sink in and take hold (some longer than others).  I can still remember hearing all of MCMXC a.D. for the first time and wondering if I liked it or not.  Now?  It's classic.  This (and every other ENIGMA) is no different.  I can honestly say that I don't have one favorite ENIGMA album; they all have unique aspects to them that I enjoy.  To me, they all compliment each other and build towards something new and exciting.      At first listen of every ENIGMA album I definitely ask myself, \\"Do I like it?\\"  The answer is never \\"no\\" but it's also rarely an instant \\"yes.\\"  However, after a week of solid listening to Seven Lives Many Faces I can honestly say that I very much like this album.      Yes, Seven Lives Many Faces is different and no, it doesn't have every element that made MCMXC a.D. so popular.  I also find some of the lyrics to be cheesy in Seven Lives Many Faces (e.g., \\"Touch me, I'll be your daddy.  Smell me, I'll be your mommy\\").  However, what it REALLY has is what all the others DON'T have.  Just what is it?  I can't tell for sure.  All I can tell you is that for me, what makes ENIGMA such an enigma is that each album is so different yet, somehow when you hear it, you know you're listening to ENIGMA.      So, don't open Seven Lives Many Faces with demands of what it should be.  Simply let it unfold to tell you what it is.  ENIGMA.

0439023483|5.0|This book was addicting. It was thrilling. It kept you at the edge of the seat. At first, you can tell that the story came from old ideas, which deterred me for a second. From the Lottery, Brave New world or to movies such as the Gladiator.. and she gave them a fresh twist. Added plenty of gore, action, suspense, confused love triangle, family issues.. it has lots to keep you locked into this story. The characters are relatable and realistic. It read fast and I couldn't stop. Something was constantly happening. No slow parts. Imagery was wonderful! The ending made me hunger for more. Very excited for the next two books that are to follow!
0312360266|1.0|This book is horrible.  The characters are annoying and the writing style is sub par. Elements of Harry Potter, Twilight, and Wicked are very apparent throughout the entire book.  There were many times that I had to put the book down in utter frustration from the obvious rip offs.  This is very unoriginal and an obvious ploy to make money off of the young adult fiction crowd. I only finished the book to see if it got better, which it didn't. The vulgar language was completely unnecessary, as well as most of the parenthetical statements. Pop culture references make the story even more cheesy. I cannot even believe this book got published.
B001E1GXPA|2.0|I was so looking forward to this release and I am just as depressed.<br />If you are fan of a vocalist who screams, no need to read any further.<br />I have always liked the music of Trivium, but the vocals on the earlier albums made them unlistenable.  The Crusade was such a big step forward and one of my favorite metal albums.  I had hoped they would continue with that trend ala A7X and BFMV - bands that used to scream and not sing.<br />Sadly, Trivium has gone the other way and now screams more than sings.<br />Fell free to buy my copy off of Amazon.
B000MZHW40|4.0|While this film was criticized for being overly-melodramatic, it remains an accurate portrait of the many issues surrounding the diamond trade in Africa.  The Kimberley Process may have sharply reduced the number of illicit stones reaching some markets, but people like the rebels, smugglers, and traders pictured in this movie have no trouble whatsoever turning their ill-gotten stones into cash even today.  The blood diamond trade flourishes in not only Sierra Leone but in Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well--and operates much like the Revolutionary United Front ran it's diamond mine in the film.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio's fine performance and Djimon Hounsou's breakthrough role as the fisherman forced into slavery in the mine make the film worth seeing even without the message-laden plot.  Kagiso Kuypers also did a great turn on the screen as Hounsou's son, Dia, who is kidnapped by the RUF at the beginning of the film.  That particular subplot could have made a fine movie on its own.

B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian provides three intense 20 minute workouts, each containing three circuits with 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  This provides tons of variety for each workout, which keeps me interested and motivated.  One reason I love this DVD so much is because the variety makes the workout seem faster, and before I know it I'm finished!  Most people will need to start at workout level 1 and work their way up to level 3.  Modifications are provided for those who have trouble doing the full movements, which is a definite necessity for me.        Before getting this DVD, my exercise routine typically involved brisk walking and jogging for 60 minutes about 4 days a week.  I got the 30 Day Shred so I could get in some more upper body and ab work while cutting down my workout time.  Two weeks after getting the DVD I am still at level 1, but am already noticing a difference in how I feel!  Of course, this cuts down on the amount of cardio I was doing before, but eventually my goal is to incorporate both the strength training learned from this DVD and the jogging.     As for the title, forget the \\"30 day\\" and focus more on the \\"shred\\".  Users are supposed to do what they can until they are able to move on to the more advanced exercises.  There aren't any rules as to how many days to do each workout routine.  Just do what you can--you will still notice a difference.    As much as I like the 30 Day Shred, it could still use some improvements.  For one thing, I wish a special feature was included that showed step-by-step how to properly do the exercise movements with good form.  Instead, you are thrown into doing the movements without much time to get comfortable with them.  For this reason, I suggest watching the workout first before trying the exercises.  There is also no information on what size weights to use.  In fact, I find that I need different sized weights for different exercises and Jillian doesn't address this issue.  For example, I need 3-lb. weights for shoulder exercises, while the 5-lb. weights would be more appropriate for the chest and back exercises.  I also think that it is unrealistic to assume that most people will be able to jump right into doing the workouts without some initial recovery period or a little cheating here and there.  I HAD to have a recovery day of rest after doing workout level 1 for the first time.  I also cheat a little on a few of the movements in order to maintain good form or because I can't lift the weight on the last few repetitions.     The introduction takes a minute or two and I use this time to put on my shoes and do some extra stretching.  I also take a little more time to stretch at the end than Jillian provides.  I strongly suggest adding some calf stretches, especially for beginners.  After my first workout, I woke up in the middle of the night with a charlie horse because my calf muscles hadn't been properly stretched.  (The jumping jacks and butt kicks can be hard on those muscles if they aren't used to the intensity.)       Overall, this is an awesome DVD for people who want a great overall workout incorporated in as little amount of time as possible.  I highly recommend it!      Also, for those of you who already have the DVD, there is a blooper during workout 1:  Natalie, the woman on the left, stops doing her lunges when Jillian points out Anita's form and the cameras start panning to the right.  :)

It was directed by \\"The Master of Suspense,\\" the great Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Look for Hitchcock's characteristic brief cameo appearance after the opening credits.  Some say that there is a second cameo.<br /><br />Briefly, our hero in this movie, mid-mannered advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), is plunged into the bizarre world of spy (James Mason), counterspy (the heroine in this movie played by Eva Marie Saint), is kidnapped, framed for murder, chased, and even crop-dusted.  I should also mention that he \\"visits\\" Mount Rushmore and gets up-close to the faces of former U.S. presidents (Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln) carved on the mountain.<br /><br />The debonair Cary Grant effectively carries this movie.  (This was Grants fourth and final teaming with Hitchcock.)  Kudos must also go to the terrific supporting cast of Eva Marie Saint, James Mason, Martin Landau (who plays the spy's main henchman), Jesse Royce Landis (who plays Thornhill's mother where in real-life Landis was only eight years older than Grant) and Leo G. Carroll (who plays the head of the C.I.A.).<br /><br />Another key ingredient of this movie is its background music.  This fantastic orchestral score was composed by Bernard Herrmann.  It effectively adds to each scene.<br /><br />Where does the movie's title come from?  There are actually many theories for its origin.  Personally, I think it comes from the fact that as the movie proceeds, Thornhill travels north on Northwest Airlines.  (One of the original titles for this movie was \\"The Man in Lincoln's Nose.\\")<br /><br />Finally, the DVD (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has eight interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of those movie gems that, in my opinion, deserves to be called a \\"classic.\\"  Roger Thornhill's ex-wives were wrong.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|Ok, lets try to put is as simple as it is, Death Magnetic is the proper continuation of what Metallica is about but decide to separate since the black album (and a liitle bit with it).     Death magnetic is a great album and a good comeback to what Metallica used to be, for us who really missed what metal is about and get tired of the crappy music that today we have to listen is fantastic to see that Metallica is capable of bringing back metal and prove that they can play as hard as 20 years ago.    Death Magnetic is way better and has nothing to do with St. Anger, load or reload but being honest is not And Justice or Master but I really believe they have improve a lot with this album, the heavy riffs are back, the solos are way better and of course the powerful drums are back, and that is something I truly believe we won't see again, on St Anger Lars's drums were really awful but here they are way better and truly loyal to what Lars use to be    I recommend Cyanide, Broken Beat & Scarred, The day that never comes    Being honest I expect a lot form this album and they do not disappoint me, I think is better than the black album and can be put one step closer to the classics Master, Ride, And Justice & Kill en All.. so its seems Metallica is coming back and with some vengeance    If you use to like Metallica you will respect Death Magnetic, if you forget about Metallica since the last three albums well you are going to listen to them again and if you still love Metallica no matter what they have release on the past few years then your are going to be blown away by Death Magnetic is Metallica at their best

B0015FML06|5.0|I always loved Under a Blood Red Sky and when this was released with a DVD I had to get it.  I have seen U2 a few times and enjoy all their music, but this was a special time for the band in their earlier days as they started to grow.    Many of the most important/famous songs from up to that point are included, GLoria, I Will Follow, Sunday Bloody Sunday.  One of my favorites is Seconds.    As others have mentioned the DVD was shot in a certain way so that there seems to be strange effects going on.  I wish it was also filmed in another way so that there would be a \\"clean\\" looking version just to see what it would look like, but it does not take away from a powerful performance by the band.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|The timing of Dexter's return was auspicious in more ways then one; with Ike Quebec and Alfred Lion wanting the champ in their corner at Blue Note and Dexter himself eager to make up for lost years banged up in jail during the fifties, now was the time to blow his mark on the developments of Harold Land, Sonny Rollins and John Coltrane. With Blue Note's wicked in house rhythm section of Sonny Clark (piano), Billy Higgins (drums) and Butch Warren (bass) ready and waiting, Go was the first quartet recording with Dexter the only horn and there couldn't have been a better platform for this titan to launch off.      Cheesecake tears straight up the guts of it, Dexter's sound continuing to fatten out with each cascading chorus, his Conn tenor responding beautifully to such a large mouth piece and reed, the booming virtuosity a challenge to any would be imitator's stamina!     After such a tour de force, the big dripping ballad of I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry is the perfect track to follow; easing everybody up, laying everybody out with that ravishing tone and vibrato.     Love For Sale is another formidable swinger with Sonny Clark's minimalism touching all the right notes and Billy driving all the way.    Three In the Morning is a cute and light way to wrap up a seriously heavy gig where Dexter's humour is equal to Sonny Rollins sardonic display of musical quotes.    Go is a veritable case history of jazz development throughout the 40's and 50's, Dexter's phrasing rich in bop and rock `n' roll phonetics with the blues always present. Back from the wilderness, his earlier conception of style and sound an influence on younger players like Coltrane, but now showing all the added experience and weight of an older man, Dex was out and he sure knew how to shout about it!

1576754499|5.0|\\"Out of Poverty\\" tells the lessons Paul Polak (Denver psychiatrist working with the local homeless) learned both in Denver and Africa in working with the poor.<br /><br />Polak's main emphasis is to go where the action is, talk to the people with the problems and listen to what they say, and then learn everything you can about the problem and alternative solutions.  Don't just sit in a field office and theorize from there!<br /><br />Think and act big - eg. plan for 50% progress within 15 years, not just .1%.  Make certain your approach is cost-effective.<br /><br />Why do so many programs fail?  Polak says the typical large-scale poverty programs rely on big solutions that benefit only big producers and users; failure to create ownership (care and repair) are other problems.<br /><br />Another problem is that many programs try to do too much.  Polak suggests addressing poverty directly - help recipients make more money, rather than focus on increased political power, education, illness eradication, etc.  Greater income allows the poor to make their own choices about which problems to then eliminate, and is much simpler to manage from a donor's perspective.<br /><br />Helping the poor earn more often involves making cheaper alternative resources - eg. treadle pumps, irrigation systems at lower cost than then available.  Ways to do this include reduced weight (eg. operate at lower pressure, allowing thinner irrigation pipe), go back to earlier historical designs and consider remaking them using new materials.<br /><br />Polak also explains why farmers are often so seemingly resistant to new approaches.  The high costs of loans, vs. low incomes, make eg. use of more expensive new seeds very risky vs. the chance of a flood wiping out their entire crop.<br /><br />Developing Country Market Impediments:  Lack of entrepreneurial spirit, failure to see an opportunity or recognize how to sell extra crops, no intellectual property protection to incentivize development of new tools, hope for subsidies (\\"Why buy a pump when maybe waiting will bring one free?\\"), corruption (surer road to getting a good job for one's son), difficult transportation, lack of information about opportunities, poor access to credit, difficulty aggregating product from small farmers.<br /><br />Recommends Gates Foundation perspective of insisting on measurable impacts that are attained.aiting will bring one free?\\"), corruption (surer road to getting a good job for one's son), difficult transportation, lack of information about opportunities, poor access to credit, difficulty aggregating product from small farmers.

I agree that a good fantasy novel is one that you don't want to put down, one that draws you into its plot and causes you to forget about your everyday life.  If you are one that enjoys that you'll love Brisingr AND the rest of the Inheritance Cycle.  I just am disapointed that book 4 isn't ready yet.  As much as I hate to see it come to a close I can't wait to see it either..
B001E1DJD4|5.0|I was a big fan of Rachael Yamagata's first album, [[ASIN:B00022KF1A Happenstance]] - not only for the music that hit the Top 40, but the lyrics of an up and coming songstress. It's been 4 years since that, and I was curious to where the maturity would take her as an artist.<br /><br />This is definitely not where I thought it would go. In an age of jaded pop artists, I couldn't blame her for going more mainstream by playing for a different market. However, Elephants is a journey into a mature, darker place within her heart, tingling with being jaded and aching to show a different side of her.<br /><br />Elephants definitely warrants a second listen through, if not to appreciate what she's done: Instead of diverting herself to the mainstream, she's turned inward to become an artist and a musician. I get the feeling that I'll be listening to this more than Happenstance.<br /><br />Musicians like Rachael Yamagata don't come across very often, and I can't wait to see where she goes next.
B00005JPY0|1.0|This and Citizen Kane are the two most overrated films ever made. Admit it, you probably wouldn't have even watched this movie if Heath hadn't died like he did.
015206396X|2.0|I'll start with the good:   1. Katsa, the main character was well developed and well thought out. She is obsessive and fiercely independent, but also lonely and self-loathing. The actions she took and the choices she made were believable and wholly her own.  2. The concept of \\"graces\\" is original and interesting.    Unfortunately, that's where the good ends in my opinion.   Katsa was the only well developed, consistent character in the book. The others were very one sided and stereotypical and their interactions with the main character were strained. I'm referring mostly to Giddon, Oll, and Raffin, but there were moments between Katsa and Po that were odd and awkward (such as when she starts crying because she suddenly realizes she loves him) as well.    The big realization came too soon and the fact that Katsa and Po were completely right about everything made for a boring climax. Speaking of the climax, it was much too quick and I ended up feeling very unfulfilled.   The romance was boring, the mountain trek was boring, and the plot to figure out who kidnapped the grandfather was especially boring (particularly since he was already safe and sound). The twist at the end was surprising and would have been a good one if she had given it some true significance or foreshadowing or SOMETHING to make me care more.     All in all, I liked the concept and the main character, but the rest was not good at all. However, this is the authors first book, and first books tend to be not as good as their future counterparts. I see some potential  in Kristen Cashore and hope to see her improve in future novels because she has a great imagination.

B001FEA9QU|5.0|This is by far the best album since ...And Justice For All!  Metallica Rocks!!! Ooooooo, yeah-hayah!
B00008AWOG|5.0|A lot of Opeth grognards will tell you that \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" is their greatest album.  Don't believe them; they get off on listening to music that was recorded in forests and other such nonsense.  \\"Still Life\\" is Opeth's masterpiece, their best album from top to bottom.    The overall sound of \\"Still Life\\" is undeniably classic Opeth, but also unique among their albums.  Nothing else they've made fits so perfectly with its underlying concept (except maybe \\"Watershed\\", but that album is the orange in Opeth's apple cart).  The album is unabashedly brutal, and often discordant to the point of being unpleasant.  Revenge is the album's state of mind.  The message is clear: this is not a nice story, and it's not supposed to be fun.  But it is fun, as long as you immerse yourself in the art.    One thing that makes \\"Still Life\\" better than \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" is the variety.  The latter contains very few accoustic breaks, and although \\"Credence\\" is soft compared to the rest of the album, it doesn't break the pattern enough to really stand out.  \\"Still Life\\" goes all the way with its two soft tracks, \\"Benighted\\" and \\"Face of Melinda\\", which is what makes them work so well.  It's weird, but these two tracks fit \\"Still Life\\" better than \\"Credence\\" fits \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" because of the greater difference between them and their context.    I believe that \\"The Moor\\" is Opeth's heaviest song, \\"Wreath\\" be damned.  No other Opeth track (not even the overhyped \\"The Baying of the Hounds\\") can project the same sense of inevitable and thoroughly unpleasant doom.  From the moment the heavily-distorted electric guitars smash through the pretty accoustic introduction like a blunt axe through the side of your neck, the mood of the album is clear.    The remainder of the tracks on the album are some of my favorite Opeth songs to date.  They perfectly mix the soft with the heavy, with the best transitions Opeth has yet written.  \\"Godhead's Lament\\" might be my personal choice asOpeth's greatest song.  The transitions between melody and discord are amazing, and the melodic sections absolutely soar.  \\"White Cluster\\" feels like an execution.  Which is good, because it actually is an execution.  It's dreadful, but in a fun way.    Overall, \\"Still Life\\" is Opeth's masterpiece.  The usual Opeth-ian emotions such as sorrow, pain, and regret are present, but saturated with an underlying sense of pure rage that exists nowhere else in their catalogue.  This is a mean album, a concept executed (no pun intended) to perfection.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|OK, OK, OK ....Best Actor of the Year....up for Best Picture of the Year...I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE THAN A WASTE OF TIME - IT WAS A REAL DOWNER!  Glad I checked this out from the library.  Only gave it two stars because of the photography.  I recommend you use your time more productively; hopefully on a film that portrays our species in a better light.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|No. That's it.  I've had enough.  You ripped me off.  I'm NOT buying your stinking DVD. I want a refund.     I have been had by these Hollywood goombas who spent all this time working on \\"the right script\\" only to come up with these great moments:  1) Indy surviving a nuclear bomb test inside a refrigerator  2) Indy being blacklisted as a \\"Communist\\"  3) Indy hanging out with a \\"greaser\\", Mr. LaBouf and starting a fight that was more like \\"West Side Story\\" or \\"American Graffiti\\" than it was like the bar fight in Nepal in the first movie  There's more...  4) The swinging on the vines by Mr. LaBouf reminiscent of Tarzan  5) The revelation that Shia is Indy's and Marion's son (what a shocker - not quite the impact as \\"No Luke, I AM YOUR FATHER!\\")  6) Then there is John Hurt - a terrific actor, who just babbles the whole movie in riddles, neither funny, scarey, or poetic  7) Kate Blanchett, who is a GREAT actress, just phones this one in; good, but come on - a KGB officer chasing a crystal skull??  8) Then there is Indy and Marion nearly sinking in quicksand only to be rescued by Shia LaBouf handing a snake to Indy to use as a rope (because Indy hates snakes), but wouldn't the snake tear? Are snakes scarier than dying???   9) Then we have this skull. I don't get it. It's not scarey, doesn't seem to have any great powers (except as ant repellant), and whenever someone holds it, it doesn't seem like it's a heavy piece of glass/crystal, it looks more like a plastic halloween costume.   10) Aliens. Aliens? Yes! A big flying saucer ascends from the Amazon jungle in this kind of weird \\"Close Encounters of the First Kind\\" meets \\"Indiana Jones.\\" A flying saucer!!!!! You've got to be kidding!     It's as if a dozen drunk monkeys got together to make this movie.     Twenty years to come up with this script?     It's almost as if they were sitting around for twenty years having this kind of conversation:  \\"So George, what's the story going to be about?\\"  \\"Well Steve, I know peoplelike flying saucers - why don't we put that in.\\"  \\"Great idea. Hey, and Shia LaBouf is a funny kid, what about making him Indy Jones' son.\\"  \\"But isn't he like 40 years younger than Indy?\\"  \\"Ya, but it'll be great - really. People will pay for this.\\"  \\"Okay, what about something with an anti-nuclear theme?\\"  \\"I love it - he can survive a nuclear bomb. I've got a guy who can do this awesome digitized nuclear cloud.\\"  \\"What else...hmm...I know, let's put him and Karen Allen in quicksand, and we can have Indy babble on like a professor - people will die laughing at that.\\"  \\"Oh, I think you're right.\\"  \\"Y'know, we have this set left over from an Amazon movie that my cousin was going to shoot - can we work that into the story somehow?\\"   \\"Good, and I've got this plastic skull that I picked up at a garage sale - that can be the main thing in the show.\\"  \\"Hey, is John Hurt dead? No, no, but I hear he has mental problems...\\"  \\"Oh, great - we can have him BE mental in the movie!!!\\"    So there it is.    Don't go. If you respect yourself as a person - don't do it. Remember how you felt after Star Wars Episode 1? Jar Jar Binks?     Don't give them a break. It stinks, it stinks, it stinks.     Since I've been reading the Old Testament, I'd throw in \\"Woa, woa, woa...\\" and a few pestilences on LucasFilms.     For phoning in these roles, and for taking my money and giving me Tarzan and the flying saucer of doom, and for giving me the \\"greaser movie\\" with an Indy-Marion white wedding post love child. I'm done with you George. Steve, go back to serious film making.  Stop it, stop it, stop it!!     The only redeeming quality of this film is that it will always be known by their one-time fans that these two guys sold out their loyal movie-going customers to cash in on cinematic excrement.

B000VWKJFS|5.0|More pop than Elton's early seventies albums and more consistent than just about anything in his catalog apart from the classic [[ASIN:B000W11JGG Goodbye Yellow Brick Road]]. Although Elton had veered into some serious confection territory since \\"Crocodile Rock\\", \\"I've Seen The Saucers\\" is a solid FM rock type song that would be on my shortlist of Elton favorites. Does it even need saying that \\"Caribou\\" includes the studio version of Elton's #2 hit, \\"Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me\\"? Pity that [[ASIN:B000WR7HK2 the box set]] substitutes an inferior live version. This is the one to own.<br /><br />Other tasty album cuts include the warm \\"Pinky\\" and the rocking \\"Grimsby\\" which was a highlight of Elton's 1974 tour in support of this album. A couple of the songs haven't worn as well, \\"You're So Static\\" and the playful \\"Solar Prestige A Gammon\\", but given the strength of this collection that's a minor quibble. I used to be an ardent fan in the mid-seventies, owning the complete Elton John from 1969 through about 1975 but of those albums, this is one of only three or four that I've replaced with a CD copy. Recommended even if you already own an Elton John \\"best of\\" compilation.

B00005JNQS|3.0|Movie was in great shape for a used product, but I expected the original case to be included in the purchase.  I received the movie in an alternative case with none of the original artwork or advertising.  I was a little dissapointed as I had ordered this as a replacement for a scratched disk that we owned and would have kept the original case if I had known it wasn't coming.  All in all the experience was ok, but I've learned to keep that in mind when ordering used movies (and keep the original case until the replacement movie is received).
B000068TPN|5.0|This film is very intense, realistic and superbly shot. The production values are incredible. As a slice of life from the Vietnam era, the film captures the esprit de corps of the troops, the strength of the soldier's wives as well as the challenge of a new era in warfare. Mel Gibson is excellent. His sargeant, Sam Elliott, was a superb characterization of a tough sargeant who went through all three major parachute jumps in World War II. He is a no nonsense warrior.<br /><br />All the more powerful is the portrayal of Gibson's faith in light of duty, courage and devotion to his men. Greg Kinnear did an excellent job as a challenged pilot creating a new Air-Cav warfare in the early days of Vietnam. His copilot \\"Too Tall\\" received the Congressional Medal of Honor decades ago. Kinnear's character finally received his CMH in the last year - long overdue.<br /><br />Powerful. Memorable. Realistic.

If you're looking for a movie that is intelligent and riveting, and will haunt you for awhile, this is a good one.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Walt Disney's 1958 \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" marked the end of the studio's first golden era and, by extension, an era in American filmmaking. Watching this 50th anniversary edition (the most lovingly compiled among these 2DVD resissue series sets), you sense everyone involved - Disney's legendary \\"Nine Old Men,\\" animators, Walt himself, even the characters on screen - knew it.<br /><br />For years Disney called his TV show, \\"The Wonderful World of Color,\\" but in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" he told an admittedly thin story (adapting an opulent Tchaikovsky soundtrack)almost through vividness alone. Sets overflow with near 3D level detail and depth, swirling scene to scene and rewarding the eye when stopping a frame. Green dominates: Princess Aurora's ponders and meets her future in the pastoral forest singing \\"I Wonder,\\" dark pea-moss clouds surround and shadow villanous Maleficient's castle (joining royal purple in her angry frustration) or green flames where Aurora's betrothed Prince Philip defeats her in the film's climax.<br /><br />Eyvind Earle's justifiably praised art background (feted in a DVD bonus) rests behind loveable ancillary characters. Three fussy good fairies (distinctive to the film's betterment by \\"Old Men\\" Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas,over Disney's objection), sweet forest animals always in Disney's repertory, a jolly king and tipsy troubadour jester divert and move the plot, pumping humor and life into a film little about plot to start with.<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was about allowing Disney's audiences one last unabashedly romantic, unironic visit to 14th century fantasyland, to the sword of truth and shield of virtue where (as Maleficient mocks),\\"True love does conquer all\\" and good fairy Fauna cries, \\"I just love happy endings.\\" Almost every animated feature to follow, starting with Disney's 1961's \\"101 Dalmations,\\" gave a sly wink or modern in-joke reference, stretching right to Princess Fiona's parody of forest scene in Dreamworks' 2000 postmodern masterpiece, \\"Shrek.\\"<br /><br />\\"Sleeping Beauty\\"'s bonus features acknowledge its cross-generational appeal. Three exceptional documentaries address its making (one covers the lengthy, excruciating \\"Sequence 8\\" alone). You get an instructive if overdramatic vintage \\"Disneyland\\" Tchaikovsky bio, featuring Walt Disney's explaining of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\"'s Technirama 70mm filming style and demonstrating stereophonic sound and widescreen picture. You get an intriguing if conventional alternative opening, deleted songs and storyboards.<br /><br />You also get children's word and dance games and Emily Osment's gawky teen-pop version of Sammy Fain's \\"Once Upon A Dream.\\" But the most notable extra is the film's digital remastering and soundtrack. It takes advantage of Blu-Ray and other home theater technology in ways even visionary Walt could not have imagined previewing the film for his TV audience. (To illustrate, compare this print with the bonus trailers from the film's re-releases). \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" stands as one of Disney's most important achievements artistically and historically, and this 50th anniversary set is the most complete and essential way to own it.eeping Beauty\\"'s bonus features acknowledge its cross-generational appeal.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I love watching Supernatural and where we are we can't get it on any stations, so it is wonderful that I can get each season through Amazon and me and my family make a weekend fest of it. Don't have to worry about commercials, pause it for any interuptions you never miss anything.
0375826726|4.0|I have yet to finish the book, but I have a general idea of how Paolini's writing stands.  Take this review with a grain of salt.    The good:  Differentiation of cultures is distinct and believable.  The political tensions between the cultures is excellent.  Nasuada, Roran, Elva, and Saphira are well planned, interesting characters.  Combat scenes are both descriptive and exciting, the best of both worlds.  His writing style is easy to follow.  The plot holds together despite the many story threads.    The bad:  Eragon's use/explinations of magic are way too convoluted and at some points contradictory (and frankly cheesy).  Character development seems forced.    The oddity:  The dialogue is very inconsistent.  It can range from either excellent to haphazard; i.e. Paolini has a lot of difficulty with genre-appropriate language.  I think this most of this is due to audience confusion (is he writing for children or adults?).    I realize that this review sounds highly critical, but I'm just trying to articulate what others probably see as the major flaws without insulting Paolini's talent.  The book itself is good, but in my mind, it has much wasted potential due to the author belaboring aspects that I (and probably most readers) ultimately don't care about.  This is probably what the most critical readers are bemoaning.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout - a very effective use of roughly 30 minutes!      I recommend additional stretching at the warm up and cool down.      A little background - I have been working out - both cardio and strength/core training 4-6 days/wk - for 5 months.      This workout showed me that the strength and core portions of my previous workout were very week.  It very much reminds me of time spent with my personal trainer who also used basic moves in a similar circuit - cardio, strength, core.  However basic/ elementary the moves, the intensity and pending results keep it interesting. I find the familiarity with the moves a plus; perfecting my form for optimal results is taken out of the equation.    Previously, I was burning over 700 calories/day on the elliptical - taking an hour of my time.  Others suggested that I was spending too much time on cardio, I justified the time for the calories....  my mistake.      My first run through this workout seemed like a good workout but not especially difficult.  The next day, my muscles and feeble voice harmonized in a cry for mercy. I felt muscles ache that I had forgotten that I had.  As I mentioned before, I recommend a little extra stretching.  I also suggest using the \\"modified\\" (easier) moves the first day, even if you are fairly fit, just to see \\"where\\" you are.      Ultimately, this is probably a great addition to a greater exercise plan.  For now however, it is all I can handle!      ...Don't let the pain or discomfort of the first few days discourage you!     (Written on my day 4)
6305882592|5.0|This movie made me laugh and laugh hard.  The wit is delicious and the satire is tangy.  The performances are brillant and savage.  This is a movie that is an easy watch that everyone with a funny bone can enjoy.

0307386171|5.0|\\"On Chesil Beach\\" is pure Ian McEwan and I mean that in a good way. There is so much packed into this short novel with so little of the writing relying on action. McEwan is a master of character study, of coming to terms with the discrepancy between what is in a character's head and what he or she actually does. This is the story of two lovers, Edward and Forence, brought together under censorious circumstances -1960s England. Their wedding night is the point about which the entire story turns, one plagued by embarrassment and misunderstanding that will change their lives forever.<br /><br />Alright, that sounds a little too much like a movie trailer for a book that is so simple and pure, but that does not make the drama any less true. I opened the front cover with a \\"let's see how he can possibly follow up Atonement\\" frame of mind. Perhaps that was not fair, but in some ways this story has some similar elements found in \\"Atonement,\\" but much more concentrated due to its brevity. McEwan deftly weaves his characters with grace and compassion willing the reader to shout \\"just say something!\\" We are moved to frustration and pity in a way that is as wonderful as it is heartbreaking.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Most new Disney editions have been improvements over what has come before, but this new edition of SLEEPING BEAUTY is an unparalleled improvement on all previous editions.  Before receiving the new Platinum DVD copy I dipped back briefly into my old VHS copy that I had for my daughter when she was a child.  4:3 ratio, poor color, in general nothing special.<br /><br />I then put in the disc for the new Platinum edition.  I was utterly and absolutely astonished.  Widescreen instead of 4:3.  The improvement in the color was unbelievable.  Now, I have to offer a disclaimer.  I watched the Platinum edition on a Philips up-conversion DVD player.  Unless you own an up-conversion DVD player and a high-def TV it won't look this good for you (though it is also available in Blu-ray -- I would love to have checked this out on Blu-ray through my Sony PS3, but I only had the regular DVD).  But with my set up the results were nothing short of spectacular.  I was absolutely thrilled with the results.  Even if you have a relatively low-tech DVD set up, this is going to be a vast improvement over the old VHS edition.<br /><br />SLEEPING BEAUTY has always had special emotional importance for me.  My Dad and I never did much stuff together.  I don't have many childhood memories of just me and him.  But for some reason he took me, when I was a very small child, to the theater to see SLEEPING BEAUTY.  I believe that it was the only movie that only he and I ever saw.  My mother took me to many, many movies, but my father only this.  We would later go as a family to many movies, but this one was just the two of us.  This alone would mark this as a special movie.  This new edition brings back the original big screen experience that I had at the Markham Street Cinema (since torn down) in Little Rock, Arkansas as a small child.<br /><br />As an adult SLEEPING BEAUTY is both a wonderful experience and something approaching self-parody.  There is A-List Disney and B-List Disney.  SLEEPING BEAUTY is without any question A-List.  It was one of the last feature length films done before the institution of the Xerox process.  I consider it the end of the Golden Age of Disney.  It ends the era that began with SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS.  The self-parody comes out in the endless take offs on elements contained in the film.  The recent (and exceptionally good) Disney film ENCHANTED takes off on the aspects of this film that shows Aurora as intimate friends with wild animals.  It is also seen in SHREK when Princess Fiona sings and makes wild birds explode.<br /><br />The was the last Disney film to be completely hand painted.  ONE HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS, the next major Disney production, utilized a xerox process that eliminated the need for most of the background painters.  The difference between this and subsequent films is palpable.  While the economics of the industry dictated that the switch to Xerox be made, it is truly said that the transformation was made.<br /><br />As a child, I found this to be far and away the most terrifying of all the Disney films.  I stil vividly remember the horror I felt as the Prince chopped his way through the barrier of thorns that surrounded the castle and the terrifying transformation of Mileficent into a terrible dragon.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of SLEEPING BEAUTY then this is a must-owen film.  If you don't know the movie, this is the only edition that you should consider for your first encounter.  As I've learned first hand, all of the Disney re-releases of their movies are utterly first rate.  But this is one of the great Disney movies.

0307346617|5.0|For a book with they \\"silly\\" premise of a zombie uprising threatening all of humanity, the stories contained within are poignant, touching, and most important believable.    The book was so engrossing, I purchased it and had it completely read in a single weekend.    It's hard to describe the emotions this book stirred up.  Anger, remorse, pride, all of these things.  And joy at discovering someone making a daring escape.  Sorrow when learning that the person being interviewed has lost a bit of his or her mind because of what they've been through.    I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book.  Not really.  I have had the Zombie Survival Guide for a while.  When I bought it, it was in the \\"humor\\" section.  \\"World War Z\\" took the tongue-in-cheek approach from that book and turned it on its head, taking itself completely seriously and *pulling it off!*    Only a few bits of data truly date the story (such as Fidel Castro being around at the end of the war).    The audio-book will be my next purchase.  I've heard the few clips from the website and I feel that will give the story even more impact.
0446677450|5.0|When I first purchased this book, it was for the simple purpose of trying to educate myself more on the concepts of how the millionaires create their success.  While I was not disappointed in any way with the context, what surprised me was that many of the fundamentals written about how to attain prosperity are spiritually based.  Robert has done a great job in explaining the \\"negative reality\\" his biological father had, as compared to his more trusting and \\"expecting success\\" friend's father.  For me, the book is an easy to read and easily understood map towards pointing everyone in the right direction.

0786915749|1.0|I read almost 200 pages and stopped.  This is badly written and poorly crafted.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of reading fantasy is learning the \\"rules\\" of the world that the author is building.  But this world doesn't seem to have any rules, so anything can happen at the author's convenience (or laziness).  I'd strongly recommend the Butcher series that starts with The Furies of Calderon instead.

B0016NF06O|3.0|You can probably figure out what this album might sound like.  It's sensible and relatively enjoyable at times, but hardly earth shattering.  If you're looking for dinner jazz that might make your guests ask, \\"Is that Willie Nelson?\\"  This is it.
0446579939|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Lucky One\\" and it was Fantastic!  The story started out slow.....but understandable once you get into the plot.  I enjoyed the close companionship of his dog - Zeus.  I loved it and now wished I had read it slower. I will anxiously await the next great book from Nicholas Sparks!  You will definitely love this one!
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I must say that I was a lil dissappointed with this album. I believe here producers was trying to hard and missed the mark. 2 of the songs that I heard like \\"STAND UP & LOVE ME OR LET ME LEAVE\\" didn't make the album. I have been a die hard fan since say one..but her album have grown on me the more I listened to it! It's worth the money and I would recommend that you go pick up ur copy today! Go Girl! I just hope that it don't be another decade before she come out with another one!
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I've been a big Madonna fan since 1983. I was excited, when I bought the album. What a huge disappointment! It seems that Madonna could not wait any longer to fulfill her contractual obligations to Time Warner and in doing so she put out a terrible album.     Rather than critiquing each song, I'll summarize the album as follows: The heavy beats and over produced music drowns out her already thin and weak voice. Her singing sounds empty and lifeless. The lyrics are cliched; Madonna, we've been there and done that with you already. Hard Candy is one of the worst CDs I own. It's a shame that at this point in her 25-year career Madonna put out her worst album ever.
0807014265|5.0|A stunning story of a man who survived the horrors of concentration camps. He is a psychiatrist and developed his own theories and method of therapy called logotherapy. The book covers his experience in a concentration camp and the second half of the book explains his philosophy of logotherapy. Frankl says that the meaning of life is found in every moment of living; life never ceases to have meaning, even in suffering and death. He encourages his patients and readers to live a full life by looking to the future rather than reliving the past.<br /><br />Quotation: \\"Self-transcendence of human existence: Being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself - be it a meaning to fulfil or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself - by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love - the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself...\\"<br /><br />Excellent read. Highly Recommended.

B00005JKED|4.0|I was torn about this movie for one fact - I really like Denzel Washington as an actor and if I see his name associated with a movie I will see it because I expect good things from him. And with the hype about this movie when it came out, I walked away from the theater a bit unsatisfied.    When he received an Oscar for this role (as oppossed to some other movies) I felt the same way the I did when Russell Crowe received one for Gladiator and not A Beautiful Mind. But that seems to happen at the Oscars.    Both Hawke and Washington turn in overall good performances (I think Hawke was better based on his role) about corruption in a police department, where Denzel is knee deep in it.    There were some very good scenes, but I did find that the movie dragged a bit. And when things became really heated during the second half of the movie, some of the scenes to me were a bit over the top/drawn out. I understand that there is a suspension of belief for these things, but it seemed to be just a bit too much.    Watching it again on DVD changed my mind a bit and I enjoyed it more than in the movies, but perhaps it is because my expectations had changed somewhat. It is probably somewhere between 3-1/2 to 4, and since I was probably a bit skewed in my initial impressions based on what I expected, and which may have carried over, it probably is a 4.

0743277708|5.0|The title of my review refers to a conversation I had with a friend about his favorite book.  We were in a book store browsing and he pointed to a book saying, \\"that's my favorite book.\\" I was immediately curious, I deeply respect this guy and consider him the smartest person I know.  I asked him what is it about, he said \\"Rabbits.\\" Me: \\"Rabbits?\\" Him: \\"Rabbits\\" Me: \\"Rabbits?\\" Him: \\"Yes, Rabbits!\\"     In the end, I did not buy the book nor did I in the near future.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!!     When I finally did decide to buy and read the book, I was enthralled.  Is there a perfect book/read? I don't know, but here's another story.    I was reading Watership Down at work on a Friday.  Time came to pack up for the day.  After being half-way home I realized I forgot Watership Down.  There was no way for me to go back and get it, and I was not going to be back at work for another two days. To make a long story short, I bought another copy of the book and finished it over the weekend.      Watership Down is a remarkable book. BUY/BORROW IT.
006091307X|3.0|The Crying of Lot 49 must have seemed incredibly witty when it first appeared in the mid-60's.  This satire, which follows the twists and turns of Oedipa Maas' adventures in being the executor of a dead friend's will is a satire on Southern California culture in the mid-60's.      The back of this book compared it to Joyce's Ulysses; while I won't doom Lot 49 with such unfortunate company, it, like Ulysses, is probably more admired by critics than actually enjoyed by readers.  The prose is intentionally dense, and the characters and events, which are set just before the rise of the hippie culture in the late 60s, seem almost quaint in comparison to what the 1960s are remembered for forty years later.      While the first 30 pages are easily the toughest to get through, the story starts to move along after that following an intereting, if not particularly compelling, conspiracy angle.  To Pynchon's credit, I didn't feel that the book was artificially lengthened in order to give the story heft--at 150 pages, Lot 49 is surprisingly brief for a critical darling.    Lot 49 reads like a poor-man's Joseph Heller, and it hasn't aged well.  But, underneath it all you can pick up some interesting commentary about California just before flower power.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album was part of Miles' \\"Second Coming.\\" Cut with only \\"one take\\" and no practice sessions. They just walked into the recording studio and \\"did it.\\" What they created \\"on the spot was not only fresh, but also \\"leading edge\\" for a very fertile period in Jazz. And it still remains virtually unsurpassed as improvised creative arts go. As Miles said in his autobiography, \\"I play what I know, and then I go above it.\\"<br /><br />That is what is done here: The whole group \\"goes above what they know\\" individually and collectively; and what they create here becomes a seminal event in the cohesion of the Jazz idiom itself; one that has left an indelible imprint on Jazz history.<br /><br />All of the hard work that this group had engaged in up until this album (which was considerable) was but prologue for \\"Kind of Blue,\\" which was a serious \\"game changer\\" even for Miles -- who was never happy with his work unless he was\\" changing the game.\\"<br /><br />Not only is this exquisitely beautiful music, that is mature, and deep in its creative vision, but music that also expands the previous structures of Jazz.<br /><br />Although Miles presaged his turn to modal music in both \\"Milestone\\" and \\"My Prince Will Come,\\" no one could have anticipated what a surprise this album would be: as in one fell swoop, it stripped away both a dependence on strict chord structures and on a strict time, tempo or beat.<br /><br />The music's cohesion is centered on, and relied solely on the mature synergy and chemistry that had developed among the players. Throughout his career as band leader it was well known that Miles asked for everything that his sidemen had: He \\"milked\\" them for every morsel of creative substance and would accept nothing less.<br /><br />On this album, he got it all. Amen and<br /><br />100 Stars

1591841984|5.0|Paradoxically, Steve Jobs continues to be one of the best known and yet least understood CEOs in recent business history. It is probably true that most of those who once worked or who now work at Apple Computer will learn more about Jobs as they read Leander Kahney's book than they knew previously.  For years, they and others shared the opinions expressed in this brief excerpt from the Introduction:<br /><br />\\"Jobs is a control extraordinaire. He's also a perfectionist, an elitist, and a taskmaster to employees. By most accounts, Jobs is a borderline loony. He is portrayed as a basket case who fires people in elevators, manipulates partners, and takes credit for others' achievements.  [Alan Deutschman, The Second Coming of Steve Jobs, Pages 59, 197, 239, 243, 254, 294-95 and Jeffrey S. Young, icon: Steve Jobs, The Greatest Second Act in the History of Business, Pages 212, 213, and 254]. Recent biographies paint an unflattering portrait of a sociopath motivated by the basest desires - to control, to abuse, to dominate. Most books about Jobs are depressing reads. They're dismissive, little more than catalogs of tantrums and abuse. No wonder he's called them `hatchet jobs.' Where's the genius?\\" All or at least some of this is may be true and yet....<br /><br />He is a \\"control freak\\" and yet \\"throughout his career, Jobs has struck up a long string of productive partnerships - both personal and corporate. Jobs's success has depended on attracting great people to do great work for him. He's always chosen great collaborators [as well as] \\"forged (mostly) harmonious relationships with some of the world's top brands - Disney, Pepsi, and the big record labels.\\" Kahney also points out that \\"through judicious use of both the carrot and the stick, Jobs has managed to retain and motivate lots of top-shelf talent...and then given them the freedom to be creative and shielded them from the growing bureaucracy at Apple.\\" As Jobs sees it, \\"My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.\\"<br /><br />I was especially interested in the material in Chapter 6 (\\"Inventive Spirit: Where Does the Innovation Come From?\\") because in dozens of recently published books about innovation, their authors' opinions vary (sometimes significantly) in terms of what it is and isn't, to what extent (if any) people can learn how to think innovatively, and whether or not innovation can be institutionalized. I was curious to know what Kahney's research (especially various interviews with Jobs and others) revealed about a company that is annually ranked among the most innovative companies in the world. For example, what's the system? Jobs once explained to BusinessWeek, \\"The system is that there is no system.\\" When asked by Rob Walker (a New York Times reporter) if he ever consciously thinks about innovation, Jobs responded: \\"No. We consciously think about making great products. We don't think `Let's be innovative! Let's take a class! Here are the five rules of innovation, let's put them up all over the company!\\" Nonetheless, we are told, \\"Jobs has an almost mystical reverence for innovation.\\" According to Jobs, it is Apple's \\"secret sauce\\" and helps to explain why Apple continues to produce blockbuster products such as the iMac, iPod, and iPhone but, Kahney adds, \\"there's also a long list of smaller, yet important and influential products\\" such as the Airport and the AppleTV. Innovation at Apple is a process with a mindset, not a project with a formula.<br /><br />Given Jobs's obvious scorn for most efforts to \\"become more innovative,\\" and there is no recipe to produce its \\"secret sauce,\\" how to explain the company's \\"innovative spirit\\"? The answer to that question is too complicated to be summarized in a review such as this, nor can a complete answer be found in any one chapter of Kahney's book. However, a partial answer reveals a great deal about what's inside Steve's brain and how it becomes pervasive throughout the organization. First, Apple determines which markets to target and how to target each. Knowing who you are and what to do are obviously important but no more important than knowing who you aren't (and shouldn't attempt to be) as well as knowing what not to do. Also, Apple remains constantly aware of all new developments in the markets in which it competes (especially those in relevant technologies) and is always receptive to new ideas. It fully embraces the business model Henry Chesbrough so brilliantly discusses in his Open Innovation and then Open Business Models.<br /><br />It should also be noted that Apple is always receptive to new or better ideas wherever they are and appropriates whatever serves its purposes. Jobs agrees with Picasso that good artists copy, great artists steal. \\"And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas.\\" Then there is Jobs's concept of the digital hub, best explained within the narrative, in context. (Please see Pages 185-188.) Based on what Kahney shares in this book, there are two principles on which the success of the company in all areas and in all markets continues to depend. First, hire only those who will contribute \\"insanely great\\" ideas that will enable the company to create \\"insanely great\\" products. Also, create a culture of constant creative confrontation.  \\"Day to day at Apple, Shawney explains, \\"meetings with Jobs can often be arguments - long, combative arguments. Jobs relishes intellectual combat. He wants high-level discussion - even a fight - because it's the most effective way to get to the bottom of a problem. And by hiring the best people he can find [and then retaining them], he ensures the debate will be at the highest level.\\" If a \\"bozo\\" somehow survives the rigors of Apple's unorthodox interview process, she or he does not last long and those responsible for hiring that person are viewed with ridicule, if not contempt.<br /><br />Few people at Apple meet with Jobs but everyone knows what those meetings are like because most (if not all) other meetings at Apple also resemble a crucible that is expected to generate precious metals in the form of insanely great ideas, the best decisions, etc. Clearly, Jobs determines the style and sets the tone for interaction at Apple. He wholeheartedly believes that \\"good\\" is the enemy of \\"great\\" and thus has zero tolerance of anyone and anything that falls short of his \\"insanely\\" high standards. It should be added that talent alone is seldom sufficient. Jobs also demands - not expects - that people at Apple be warriors, eager to engage in combat to \\"win\\" arguments with associates. Intellectual combat is a key ingredient in Apple's \\"secret sauce\\" and Jobs is the company's master chef. Despite the efforts of most employees to avoid him, there is always the chance of encountering him unexpectedly in a hallway, elevator, rest room or parking lot. He will immediately grill them about what they are doing, how they are doing it, etc. Although some have described Apple as a \\"regime of terror,\\" it continues to be an almost pure meritocracy.<br /><br />In this book, Kahney provides an extended tour inside Steve's brain. What is it like in there? Obviously, the Apple culture is an extension of Jobs's personality and style. To me, it resembles a minefield, a lush garden filled with beautiful flowers and plants, a fireworks display, a demolition derby, a six-year old's birthday party, a torture chamber, a vast green meadow, a shooting gallery, and a state fair. I urge you to take your own tour with Leander Kahney. I promise that it will never be dull. With Steve Jobs, nothing ever is.determines which markets to target and how to target each.

0307383415|5.0|This is the most compelling story that really resonates with me. Barak Obama's life connects with a little bit of everyone no matter your race or background. In his book, Barak Obama articulates the near and distant relationships specifically with his grandparents and estranged parents, which ultimately shaped his character to what it is now; open, inclusive and inspirational. After reading this book, I knew that this was no ordinary man. If an ordinary man he is certainly destined for extraordinary things. He is genuine and open about his past even the troubling part he tells about his youth. You Must Read! I was spell bound, once you start reading you won't stop until finished.

B00133KFGW|5.0|I can't believe this movie didn't do well with the critics.  I guess cynicism has no place in this movie, so they felt left out.  Terrific family movie, love story, musical, inspirational film.  I have recommended it to many of my friends and family.  I also purchased the CD and listen to it in the car quite a bit. Robin Williams is a kick, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers is compelling, and he really sang his own part.  The musical talent is awesome, and there's real joy conveyed throughout the film, even when times are tough.  Wonderful.

The artwork is nicely done, and the dialogue is smart and witty. The dark nature of this graphic novel is not for kids, but it is for every one who is a Batfan/Jokerfan. And the killer joke at the end is priceless, typical material from Batman's most notorious enemy.

Brandon Lee's (sadly) final performance is a treat: he is the one and only \\"Eric Draven\\", and all the others are just copycats of him. Pacing and direction of this film is compelling, while the wicked art direction stands out. Action sequences are a must-see, and the script is purely well-written. ***** out of *****.

The Season Finality was so fast moving, that you can only sit speechless infront of the TV.    Due to the writers strike there are only 5 DVDs, which made the Season look very small. I purchased the Season because I am a fan, but if I would not be one, I would have not paid the whole price for a DVD less!
B0016AJU2C|5.0|I like to wait for a few months before giving an accurate review of an album like this because there is a lot of depth to it, musically and lyrically. Anyway, after seeing her perform many of these songs in concert in Philadelphia, she really has created some long lasting favorites that will be staples of her setlists for the future. Alanis has always been very challenging when deciphering her meanings to her lyrics, and these songs are no exceptions. Some are very blunt and to the point, some are very clever in their hidden meanings. Musically the entire CD has a nice flow to it, and the extra songs are a must to have.   Her voice has matured beautifully over the years. Somehow she still has control of both rage and solitude in one breath. This is Alanis at her best for 2008.
B0000025SB|2.0|The Final Cut suffers a bit from not enough musical ideas, and trying to make the lyrics the MAIN appeal of the album over everything else.  Clearly this was an approach not everyone can appreciate, including me.  The lyrics are nice, and some of the vocal melodies are good enough, but this album is definitely lacking compared to EVERY other Pink Floyd album created before this one.

0307277887|1.0|I was so disappointed. I pounced on this book hungrily, couldn't WAIT to read it.<br /><br />My problems with it:<br />Boring and repetitive. Barely a shell of the show, hardly a good read. I had to force myself through it. I honestly don't see why they decided to make this into a show, I guess it was a pretty good decision since the show is so freaking amazing but yeah, the book is riddled with poor writing that could have been fixed with a good editor. Words are used over and over again  and gives the impression that the author has a really poor grasp on writing. It really seems like Deb blushes every other page, it disgusts me. The book plays on her sexuality in a way that just makes me feel like a huge creep. Things that were gasp-worthy in the show are diminished and played down in the novel.  The ending was likewise poor, I felt that the people who adapted this for the show did a stellar job of cleaning up a messy novel. Would Never Read Again. Anyone want my copy?
B000UMXCTY|4.0|The Collection is compilation of all their records they recorded together and The Concert In Central Park. These records are as follows Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.. Sounds of Silence, Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme, Bookends and Bridge Over Troubled Water. I love tracks such as Sounds of Silence, Scarbourough Fair, Mrs. Robinson and Bridge over troubled water. Sometimes I feel though that their lyrics are a bit wordy and pretentious. Sounds of Silence is a track that I love but the line about teaching is so 60's and feels so self righteous. I also find their songs to be a bit uneven at times. They are certainly not in the same league as either Beatles or Roling Stones and some of the lyrics seem a bit forced. As if they were trying to impress a little bit too hard.

B001CIPU3G|5.0|First of all, this album should NOT be compared to The Crusade in such ways as saying its a step up or step down from it. Its really a hybrid album. Too many people are basing their opinions of Shogun by saying that its too intense compared to The Crusade and they miss the melody and singing on that album. Then still others are saying that The Crusade was a mistake of Trivium's and this is a return to original form that Ascendancy introduced us to. I say both sides are wrong. This album is Ascendancy and The Crusade all in one, but even more in your face. As I said, hybrid album.    With Shogun, Trivium has mixed the melodic singing, lightning fast guitar work, and blistering drumming of The Crusade with the screaming, up in your business, heavy metal of Ascendancy. The combination is undeniably brutal. You get the best of both. Fans of The Crusade, which I admit I loved, will easily cling to the parts of songs where Matt Heafy is melodically chanting over speedy drum work and machine gun guitar riffs, but then its over as fast as it started and the vocals turn up a notch and the music becomes chunky and heavy while Heafy takes on demonic screams like those that riddled the Ascendancy album.    Highlights of the album:  --- Great lyrics! Check out the lyrics to \\"Into The Mouth Of Hell We March\\" (Epic story in this song with lines like: \\"Spires of lightning thrown down from the gods! Skin melting even in the deluge!) and \\"Throes of Perdition\\", another great story with great music accompanying it.  --- The guitar solos are insane! Fast, original, and ear piercing. LOTS of harmonizing here.   --- The drumming is top-notch. Travis Smith is easily my favorite metal drummer right now. BLAZING fast double bass work, and very original and masterfully built drum fills. Travis is really coming into his own.   --- Long intricate songs. Tempo and feel changes throughout. Its sick! Most songs clock in at over 5 minutes, several are just shy of 5 minutes by mere seconds. The title track itself is nearly 12 mins long.  --- The production is excellent. Amazing clarity. If you have a good set of headphones, listen with those. Smith's tom fills seems to wrap around your head and the solo's seem to start on one side of your head and travel through your skull sonically bouncing around inside until connecting with the other ear. Its wicked.    As a side note, even if you don't like the album, you've got to at least admit the cover art is awesome. Ha Ha.     But seriously...SHOGUN HAS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE:  1) If you're into speedy licks, its here.   2) If you're into in your face screaming, like many of you Ascendancy fans are, well, you're gonna get it.   3) If you loved the melody of The Crusade but wished the intensity had been turned up a few notches, Shogun won't disappoint.   4) If you're a guitar solo junky, welcome home, this album delivers.  5) Even a few \\"epic\\" storylines to get lost in. You can practically envision the events unfolding in your mind as you listen.    Pick this album up, its hella cool.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Love Dexter and Season 2 did not dissappoint.  Only issue I found was info on box said that Disc 3 had a couple full episodes of other Showtime series but really only contained two episodes of one series (Brotherhood?).  Not a big deal but was looking forward to seeing a preview of Dexter Season 3 and other items that were not there.
B000NY12CI|5.0|It takes a lot of courage to stand up against the views of your family, community, country, religion.  Not many people would put their own lives in danger for the benefit of helping others.  Ayaan's story is unique and her style very easy to read.  It is very inspiring!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|This Metallica cd is simply their best in years. The more you listen to it, the better it gets. I would recommend this to any Metallica fan, especially those that liked the early releases. They have definitely gone back to their roots for this one.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|First off, I've been a Metallica fan since Kill Em All. So I know what they sounded like back in the good ol' days.  And this album does not live up to the expectations that the band put on it.  It is the best album they've put out in years. Of course the 3 previous albums were just horrible, Load, Reload and St. Anger.  The departure of Bob Rock and the arrival of Rick Ruben is definately the cause for this improvement.  The music contains many riffs that herald back to the days of Master of Puppets and And Justice for All, unfortunately James Hetfield's vocals still seem to be too influenced by Bob Rock's attempts to make him \\"sing\\".  If you like Load or the albums after that, then you'll probably like this one, but if you're an old schooler you'll probably find this album almost as painful to listen to as the previous few albums.  Unfortunately, I feel the Metallica of old is dead and will never return, and the rock-pop, money loving Metallica is here to stay.
B001BKXUOQ|5.0|First off, I think this album is great. Ive been a fan since they started in '99. there is at least one song on this cd that sounds like each other album. Including, Wherein Lies Continue sounding like the first album, Gematria sounding like Iowa, and a few songs sounding like Vol III. however, there are a few songs that sound very similar to Stone Sour. Now, they are great too, but i thought the concept was to keep the two seperate. And here, they didnt. Even though Gehenna fell into this catagory, it remains a experimental and breakthrough song for Slipknot. They have captured the \\"Sing-A-Long Bash your head against the nearest wall, rock chorus....\\" If you do purchase, upgrade to the special edition. The extra 5 or 7 bucks is so worth it. The booklet is bigger, the 3 songs make the money worth it alone, and the dvd is fun to watch for the 35 minutes it lasts. Very similar to \\"Inside the Nine\\" DVD. All in all, worth my twenty bucks, and hasnt left my cd player since i got it the first day. I scream my lungs out to every line.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Wow! They really did an awesome job of creating the blu-ray version of this movie. I really like this classic and the blu-ray movie is a must for any Patton fan. The audio and video are excellent. I could not be happier with this blu-ray version. Well worth the money if you really enjoy this movie.
B000NA2348|5.0|I don't care what the review says, this is the best cover of Across the Universe ever! The best song on the CD next to Fame and better than Fiona Apple's and Rufus Wainwright's, which are pretty good themselves.<br /><br />I love the drumming at the end of the song and both John & David going at it (if that is John Lennon with him). A cover song is supposed to sound different than the original but keep some elements and this song is definitely David Bowie's version not Beatles which is a classic by itself. Why do the song the same as the original?<br /><br />Anyway, David is no stranger to great covers, Let's Spend the Night Together is even better than the original.<br /><br />And I love it when they cover him too. I love Seu Jorge and even the much maligned Barbra Streisand cover of Life on Mars? I give her props for tackling it in her Butterfly album (the best song on that CD too) and I like her vocals in it even though the instrumentation is not as mystifying as David's with Piano and Cello's etc... Her voice was great, if she could redo it with his music that would be a treat.
B00005B36H|5.0|The first tool cd that i bought was lateralus. my sons have listened since they were 16 or so. now I am hooked on tool myself, and have gone to 2 concerts with them. the first few times you listen seems ok then the more tool you hear you understand how really great they are they are pure music rock n roll one of my top band besides bowie and zepplin and many others from the past. they are awsome
B001DPC52C|4.0|Within Temptation has been my top favorite female fronted band for a few years now and I won't go into repeating everything that has been said already. Although I will say that I bought the import version of this release, as I wasn't going to settle with 2 discs as opposed to the 4 disc version overseas.<br /><br />With that out of the way, yes, this concert is amazing! The choir and orchestra backing the band really add a whole new dimension to their music and fits perfectly. Their music was made to be performed like this. However, I am deeply bothered by the fact that (yet again) one of this band's most touching ballads (\\"Our Farewell\\") has been ignored and left off of this set. On the MOTHER EARTH TOUR set, the song was slaughtered by an opera singer, rendering it unlistenable. And it was completely left off of THE SILENT FORCE TOUR, but that can be forgiven. What cannot be forgiven is them leaving this song off of THE BLACK SYMPHONY. I do not understand why this band seems to be ashamed of this song and still refuses to include a good live version of \\"Our Farewell\\" on any of their live boxsets (yes I know there are other live recordings on singles, but I want it on one of their full concerts). \\"Our Farewell\\" was begging to be performed at this show. Within Temptation had a grand opportunity to make this song sound far more powerful and epic than it ever has sounded before, and they, unbelievably, left it off this set again. It now stands alone as their only major single which was left out of this concert and it's absense from this, otherwise stunning set, drives me up the wall and nearly ruins the whole thing for me. I most certainly hope that if Within Temptation releases another live set in the future, they will finally give us a great live version of \\"Our Farewell\\" to make up for it being given the shaft on all three of their major concert releases.<br /><br />For this one (and only complaint) I took off one star and will be saving the 5 star rating for the future concert they (hopefully) will release that will finally include ALL of their singles.they (hopefully) will release that will finally include ALL of their singles.
076531178X|5.0|I'm a very picky person when comes down to books, so after looking for a good read for hours, right before leaving the library I came across this book, Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson, if it hadn't been for its cover I probably would have never noticed it, and I know they say don't \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" but boy were they wrong about this one, after sitting down and reading the first chapter I was almost completely sure that Mistborn would fall into my top 5 books, just like its cover, a great book, it had some flaws, but small things compare to the genies work Brandon had done with the main characters and magic system, after reading the hall book I felt like a 5 year old wishing Pokémon were real. Brandon elaborated on the magic system and on the ash covered world so well every time I picked it up it completely swallowed my for hours. In all a great book, and after reading the 2nd book of the series, Brandon became one of my favorite authors.  I thank god Brandon picked such a good cover artist, or I would have never read this piece of art.
031237593X|4.0|Dealing with complex issues, a distant time, and unfamiliar (to me) names, this author knocked it out of the park. This book is absorbing from its first page to its last. While managing to tell the not-uncomplicated story of the Wars of the Roses, the author creates compelling, even sympathetic, characters. Her research is obviously well-done, as her descriptions of everyday life in that long-ago time were vivid and fascinating.<br />I loved this book.
031606792X|5.0|I received this book in two days and I had just finished the third book, I was able to start reading right away. I loved this book just as much as the other three. Pass your book on to someone else after you are done, so they can have the same enjoyment you did!

0394548442|5.0|This is a book I would recommend for anyone to read.  By reading the book you get a personal perspective on the ones affected by the bombing.  This edition has an additional chapter, written years later, where the author gives an update on the people in the book.  Very good read!

B001C3KCSY|5.0|Many \\"true\\" fans of a band are listening for something when they listen to a new album for the first time.  And if they don't hear what they expect, the band has taken a step back or sold out.  I urge everyone to listen without prejudice when listening to any new CD.    That being said, this is a great Rock and Roll album.  If you're unfamiliar with the band and love Rock and Roll then I highly recommend this album and Kings of Leon in general.  They are refreshing.  They make rock music that makes me happy.  Novel concept.  Please keep going guys.

0395631246|2.0|If you are uncomfortable with your current negotiation technique and strategy and seek to improve it, this book will offer you great help. It is comprehensive and easy to read with lots of great examples. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with your current negotiation ability this book will seem repetitive and obvious. The authors make it clear that career negotiators who have read the book agree that it teaches them what they already know, but the negotiators also laud the authors for outlining clearly and in laymen's terms \\"The Method\\" as they refer to it, even as a refresher. Note that this is not a sales strategy book that will help you get your way by any means, it is a book advocating healthy, relationship friendly negotiation.
0446579939|5.0|I have to admit that this book started a little slow for me, compared to Nicholas Sparks' other novels I've read, but it definitely didn't disappoint me in the end. I'll spare the details of what the plot is about - other reviewers have talked about it enough and there's a handy description of it at the top - but what I will tell you is that this is another Nicholas Sparks novel that will be hard for you to forget, or put down. You will fall in love with the characters he's so skillfully crafted, you will laugh with them, you will shed tears with them, and you will connect with them as if they are real people that you know.     You will also marvel at how the lives of these characters are all coincidentally interwoven with each other in some strange way. You will wonder how Nicholas Sparks manages to center his stories around the same general theme of love and fate, but still continue to shock you time and time again, without fail.    The Lucky One is a true heart-wrencher, at its finest. It is truly another unforgettable masterpiece by Nicholas Sparks. But, don't take my word for it. Go read it for yourself. I dare you not to be hooked.
B00011F5DK|5.0|I got this game to play with my kids. I'm always looking for games that can be fun, and challenging for kids and adults. This one is pretty fast, and can be played by younger kids too. My youngest is 7, and he also enjoys it. It can be played with only two players, but it isn't as challenging. My kids like it and I LOVE it. I am always looking for someone to play the game with. This is much better than typical board games for kids.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|Sound quality bad on this CD.  Mixed too loud to the point that sound is clipping and there is very little dynamic range.  We deserve better.  If you don't know what I am talking about, you won't notice the difference - so go ahead and buy it.

0307383415|2.0|ok first off I am not in favor for Obama's political ideals, lets just get that out of the way now. This Book was Sooo Boring. I wanted to know more of the man, and what better way the by his own words.  I think I found out more stuff about him before he was alive. He talks about the great life of his family and the web of emotions connected to the race differance between his father and the mothers side. He also goes on about the \\"true love\\" connection of his father and mother ...BEFORE HE WAS CONCIEVED... sorry but if I was to write a book of my own life and the connection I had with my father, I'd might start with my earliest memory. He talks of stroking of hands and gazing of eyes like he was there. People might call this filler  and/or juicing the story up, I call it packing a troubled past up with white lies to make it look presentable.    Saying that I find much of his ideals and \\"black\\" reactionary remarks in the book racist and selling out the \\"we can do it\\" idea to a self-victimizing hate speech.
031606792X|3.0|I didn't get around to reading the book until recently, so I am obviously not a rabid fan.  In fact, I found the second book to be excruciating, and the third felt like filler, but, I'm not one to leave a series unfinished... And I had heard that some people weren't happy with the last book, so I was curious to see what all the talk was about. And after I read Breaking Dawn, I still wasn't sure why people were so upset.  I felt like this was perhaps the best one of the series.  It was the most interesting, the most engaging, and had the most developed plot of just about all of the books.  Bella finally stopped being an immature, annoying whiner, there was a minimum of melodramatic pining, and she wasn't this uselessly weak character anymore.  And that is why so many people didn't like this book.  What I found annoying and unnecessary and a weakness in the other novels is what so many of you romance lovers connected to, so since the melodramatic romance was at a minimum in Breaking Dawn, of course you guys wouldn't like it as much.  But, really, if you look at things objectively, this is one of her best written books and certainly the most engaging for me, personally...

B0012K1ILW|5.0|This won't be played much on the radio. Very 'conscious' and meta-science oriented; everything has several hidden and obvious meanings and msgs and so very Badu. This to me is more like her first album.  This is for the 'third eye' children. This is food for your cypher.
B0019T9FL6|2.0|I can not say how long I have been waiting for Jennifer Hudson's cd. She was my favorite from that season of American Idol. Well, this cd reminds me why I felt she lost to Fantasia..... Jennifer simply (or her handlers) chose the wrong songs for her. Those bad outfits on Idol did not help but that is another discussion. I think Jennifer is beyond talented. But these songs for the most part are forgettable. I was thinking her project would be less pop and more grown and sexy. Honestly, Jennifer had better songs on her myspace page after she left Idol and none of those songs are this cd. I love Clive Davis but all of his artist of lately (Leona, Jazmine Sullivan) are being given songs that are just not on caliber with their amazing voices. I was surprised to see many of the who's who listed as song writers but not enough of them really did Jennifer justice. I wish Missy and Stargate & Neyo had contributed more to this project.    I also think JHud would have really wowed us if she done a cover of some an Angela Bofill's \\"Angel\\" or \\"I Try\\",  Gladys Knight's \\"Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me\\" or \\"Neither One of Us\\" or even Miki Howard's \\"Love Under New Management.\\"     Standouts: Spotlight (But then again I love everything Neyo and Stargate do), We Gone Fight, And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going and I'm His Only Woman    Everything else was nothing spectacular.    I would have really loved to see Jennifer paired up with more songwriters that are more ballard oriented such as Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, LT Hutton, Babyface, Shep Crawford, Ryan Tedder, Sean Garrett or Bryan Michael Cox.    Even Dre and Vidal, Chucky Thompson, The Clutch, Kerri Hilson, Gordon Chambers or R Kelly could have helped this be better.
0446691437|5.0|I have purchased ten copies of this book, and I imagine I will be ordering more, to give to all of my artist friends.  This is a powerful book that inspires the reader to take bold leaps in their creative journeys...it has become my artistic manifesto!
B00005JPS8|2.0|Hype can work against anything that is mediocre.  If it doesn't live up to the hype, it becomes a bigger disappointment than would have without the hype. This movie, Ironman, was just an ordinary action movie. Personally, there are too may holes in the plot to live up to Stan Lee's reputation.  When you are expecting the detail and original ideas generated in comics or graphic novels you know that plot lines and details really matter.  This movie didn't live up to that scrutiny.    As Marvel's first major production movie it was just OK.  Again, I was expecting to be told a story of Tony Stark, Stark Enterprises, Obediah, Pepper and war, that's what I got.  However, with the wealth of truly original story lines and material generated over 30 years of Ironman I expected the story to move and excite me.  It didn't.    There are many different time lines and plot development techniques that could have been employed here.  Instead it was a straight forward and unfortunately, generic version of Ironman.  I had thought that with all the complaining Marvel did when the big studio's did, Spiderman(s), Daredevil, Ghostrider, The Fantastic 4(s) and X-Men that they themselves would have learned that it is not just a movie; these are legends.  These stories should be treated like the campfire legends of history. But instead, we just got a movie.    In my opinion Jon Favreau did a good job, Robert Downey did an excellent job and although I didn't agree at first, Jeff Bridges did an excellent job as well.  They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with.  I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.    Personally, I wish I would have rented this one rather than buying it.
0739302752|4.0|This (audio) book has some good examples of bad execution that lead to recent high-profile corporate troubles, and then gives some suggestions on how to do things.  A lot of it is common sense and discipline, though, but there are a few helpful items - especially if you didn't pay the new-item proce and got it used :)
0756404746|5.0|First a word on length. The Name of the Wind, in case you didn't notice, is over 700 pages long. That might sound overly long or daunting, but it actually works very well for this book. I took it with me on vacation thinking that I would never read a book that long from front to back in about a week's time. Boy was I wrong!<br /><br />Granted, I'm probably a faster reader than most, but this book is a quick read. The chapters are short, which helps pull you through at a good clip. There's lots of action and dialog without a great deal of internal dialog or exposition to slow things down. As a reader I found myself constantly wondering what was coming next and looking forward to finding out.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind actually represents two stories. There is a third person current events type of story which wraps around a first person narrative. The Kingkiller Chronicle part is the latter story told by one of the characters introduced in the former. That's where the Day 1 thing comes from - it's the first day of a multiday telling, and focuses on that character's youth to latter teen years.<br /><br />Basically, you have two parallel tales working to keep you engaged. I, for one, think it's been fantastically done through this point, and I'm eager to get on to the next book in the set. I find myself missing the characters and the world since finishing this first one. I can't think of any book I've read in a long time that has sucked me in like this.
B000002PH1|5.0|As I'm throwing out my old cassettes that have long ago been replaced by cds, I stumbled across this again and I love it still.  There isn't a song on it that I dislike and it's the kind of cd that I can listen to over and over and not get tired of.  It's Belinda's second solo cd and to me, it's still the best of them all.  It has fast funky songs on it and ballads too of course.  My favourites on here are the title track Heaven Is A Place On Earth, Circle In The Sand, the boppy Fool For Love and Love Never Dies.  Like I said earlier, I don't dislike any song, but these four stand out a little more to me.  Belinda has a unique and stunning voice and that along with good songs really make this one of my favourite albums of all times.  I love it still to this day and highly recommend it.

They just had a Ho-Hum script to work with. I would suggest sending the screenplay writers to Pakistan for some more research.    Edited on October 11, 08:  At first I was very disappointed with the movie, even regrettedpurchasing it.  Now I have watched it 2 more times and I have actually enjoyed it more each time.  The Blue Ray 2nd disc is really interesting with an entire breakdown of the process from set location to casting, all the way to title graphics and sound editing.  If you like to see how movies are made this is one of the better bonus discs I have seen.  For the action, thriller, buff it is actually more like a 3 star to 4 star movie.
B000002AH1|5.0|Live Evil??..Well, no evil at all to be found here. It's just the pure heavenly jazzthing. When do we hear the music best? When it is performed Live, and that's what is happening here! They are playing in the way the word is ment. Playing, searching, taking over the soli, feeding and being fed. On this set(it's a double-cd, so plenty of joy here!)you can also hear those loveley little things done by the under-exposed mastership of percussionist Airto.. ( ever listended to his early recordings? wow!!)<br />I have a lot of Miles-lp's and cd's here, so the ears are well-satisfied and I listened a lot to those recordings.. Still, for me the sessions after and around BITCHESBREW are my favorits. With this Cd I added a joy that really brings a new pulse to the love for Miles. Maybe McLaughlin has been his best Guitarman.. ( now touring with Chick Corea, hope they bring out a CD too..) Anyway, when you are a Miles-lover, then buy this one too, you will be re-surprised !! The sound is a little thick because of the live-recording ( probably on primitive tapes in that time, but this is gone within minutes because the quality of the music takes you completely!!
B000001I0K|4.0|Gotta love these guys.  The Cramps are an odd band indeed.  Combining the primitive and aggressive stylings of punk rock with a classic surf guitar sound and old-time rock 'n roll sensibilities with lyrics about B-movies movies, sex, and just plain weirdness delivered with a winking sense of whimsy makes for one wacky psychobilly band.  The \\"Psychadelic Jungle\\" album was recorded in the early 80's and as a gift to those who buy this album the EP \\"Gravest Hits\\" (1977) is presented on this CD as well.  The production is nonexistent, the band is chaotic, the lyrics are nonsensical, but it's damn near impossible not to enjoy The Cramps' music.  They are the perfect band for a Halloween bash and sound like they should be scoring a [[ASIN:B000UAE7O0 Robert Rodriguez flick]].  You have likely heard them singing \\"Surfing Dead\\" (not from this album) in the film [[ASIN:B000RPCK2Y The Return of the Living Dead]].<br /><br />Right from the get-go Poison Ivy's stone-groove rhythm guitar draws you in.  \\"Green Fuzz\\" may be about marijuana or maybe charismatic frontman Lux Interior is just singing nonsense as usual, but I'll be damned if it doesn't sound great.  The album oozes, throbs, and lurches along from there with an eery groove that brings to mind some sort of voodoo ritual.  Interior's perpetually off-kilter delivery is nothing if not entertaining.  \\"Rockin' Bones\\" has him insisting that his skeleton be hung up on the wall after he dies so he can keep on rocking while the percussion sound seems to suggest that it would make a good musical instrument.  \\"I'm proud of my life, but I don't know why\\" he sings on \\"Primitive\\" which is sort of the band's mission statement.  The Cramps make primal music about primal things and they are indeed proud of it.  The humor is carefree but the tone still manages to be foreboding.  Whether paying noisy homage to the violence of pro-wrestling in \\"The Crusher\\", buzzing loudly into the microphone as a \\"Human Fly\\", or making lurid double-entendres in \\"Goo Goo Muck\\", Lux Interior makes you love him.  Seriously, if you don't smile at the sagely \\"Don't Eat Stuff Off the Sidewalk\\" then you hate funny.<br /><br />Other highlights for me include The Cramps' tribute to insanity, \\"Beautiful Gardens\\", which features among it's unhinged laments \\"the vampire lesbos are after me!\\".  But those are the best kind of lesbos, man!  The song eventually collapses into an incomprehensible mess, which is fitting when depicting a man's descent into madness through music.  The double shot of \\"Jungle Hop\\" and \\"The Natives Are Restless\\" give cannibals their rockin' due.  Among the old-time covers from \\"Gravest Hits\\" is \\"Surfin' Bird\\".

0670018651|5.0|I'm older now, and I have a little more disposable income (and a lot more self-confidence), so I have had great fun using this book's witty reviews to guide me in trying and purchasing perfumes.  I never had more than one or two bottles of perfume on my vanity table before.  Now I have several dozen because this book has made me see perfume in a whole new way.<br /><br />Yes, the book is a delight to read, but I have found it much more fun to actually use.  Interestingly, I discovered just how interactive this book can be because I am a book lover.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the book's description of a perfume by L'Artisan Parfumeur called Dzing!  The authors likened the perfume's scent to a \\"secondhand bookstore.\\"  I purchased a bottle on a whim when I happened across it on a trip to New York.  It was only when I was browsing at my favorite used bookstore days later that it struck me.  The vanilla overtones in this fabulous scent do indeed evoke the wonderful aroma of old paper.  I smelled my wrist, I sniffed the terrific, familiar book-laden air around me, I felt a happy sense of discovery and I was hooked.<br /><br />Since reading this book, I have stuck it into my tote whenever I plan to be in a major department store.  The book's vignettes ignite my curiosity and imagination.<br /><br />Take, for example, Thierry Mugler's Angel.  The authors deem this scent a masterpiece.  They tell the reader the history behind the scent -- that it started as a joke which combined the elements of a masculine and a feminine fragrance, but that in making that joke the perfumer came up with a truly new kind of scent.  The authors point out that Angel exists in a \\"high energy state of contradiction.  Many perfumes are beautiful or pleasant, but how many are exciting?\\"  Then the authors deliver the zinger, which  gives me a mental image for placing the perfume into my own life context.  They say that Angel evokes that \\" woman in a film who seethes \\"He's so annoying!\\" and marries him in the end.\\"  I got that!  I could then smell the contradiction and the attraction in the scent.  I purchased a bottle because the scent now \\"speaks\\" to me in a way it never could have before I read this book.<br /><br />Is perfume necessary to my existence?  No.  When my children were small and we had meager time, money or energy, perfume was simply that handy bottle of Chanel No. 5 my mother had sent me for Christmas which I sprayed on to feel pretty on those infrequent dinner/movie dates with my husband (when we could get a babysitter.)  Do I agree with everything the authors say about the various perfumes?  No, but that's part of the fun.<br /><br />This book has opened a pleasant door for me.  Perfume has become a fascinating foray into sensual exploration.  I enjoy reading the metaphors and similes, the creative adjectives and backstories describing these perfumes, and then experimenting with the truth of them for myself.<br /><br />The authors have done something wonderful with this book.  They have taken the mystique which advertising has always made sure surrounded fragrance and swept it away.  But they have replaced that mystique with something better -- little personalities, if you will, for the different scents.  Now browsing at the perfume counter has become like attending a cocktail party filled with famous people.  Some will speak to you immediately.  Some will stand back, but become friendly if you approach. Some are dull as dishwater.  Some you will dislike.  But being an insider at the party is exciting.  I love that I have an invitation.hat!

1579126286|4.0|Hard to believe, with all the books I read, that I've never read an Agatha Christie before, but indeed, I have not. This was my first, and I can certainly see why Christie is the world's most-published novelist. If there's one thing Christie can do, it's tell a good story. And that's precisely what she does in Evil under the Sun. I can see why readers find Christie's work compelling; she draws her readers in quickly, with a large cast of thickly-described characters and a vivid sense of surroundings. Evil under the Sun brings us to a seaside resort, where a group of holiday-makers, including Christie's famous Inspector Poirot, find themselves attempting to deal with a broad range of personalities. Likely the most abrasive of all is the beautiful and capricious socialite Arlena Marshall. When she turns up dead in a remote part of the beach, it becomes Poirot's calling to determine her murderer. The resort's island location makes it unlikely that anyone outside the hotel could be responsible. Thus, Poirot must discover the murderer in his midst. Everyone, it seems, had a motive. Yet everyone too had an alibi. The answer turns out to be far more complicated than anyone had anticipated. Christie's gift is clearly to tell a gripping story. While there are no great lessons on morality or statements on the human condition within this it is certainly entertaining, enjoyable, and just a bit scary.
0064410935|4.0|This is the story about the famous pig Wilbur, who was born tiny, but was saved by a little girl, Fern, and later saved by a spider named Charlotte.<br /><br />Fern convinces her dad to let her take care of the tiny baby pig until he is big enough to go back into the barn.  After he goes back into the barn, he still needs to be saved from being made into ham and bacon and sausage.<br /><br />I loved the cozy barn life and the animals, and the relationship of Wilbur, Charlotte, Fern, Templeton, the sheep, and the geese.<br /><br />I also loved the fair.  I love fairs, so naturally, I loved this part of the book.<br /><br />The first time I read this book was when I was thirteen.  Back then, I really loved the book so much, and felt it was perfect and flawless.  Since then, I saw bits and pieces of the movie when it came on tv (I'm not a tv or movie watcher).<br /><br />I always knew I would eventually read the book again.  I finally did.  However, this time, I did not find it perfect and flawless.  Although the storyline was still perfect and sweet, there were gross things in this book that did not bother me when I was thirteen.  The older I get, the more sensitive I get.  It's hard to believe I grew up in a farm/ranch situation and around \\"gross\\" things, but they didn't bother me back then; now I know I could never live on a farm again.  That's why one star is missing; while I was reading this book, I couldn't eat or even think about eating - I'm that sensitive to \\"gross\\" things.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Life is messy and Juno needs help, not judgement. She made some bad choices (pre-marital sex) and got pregnant. This story of her trials and tribulations as a pregnant teenager would be great for discussion(s)/debate(s) for a high school health class. I love that it promotes family and pro-life. I purchased this movie along with the soundtrack and I love them both.
0439023483|5.0|I read this book upon the recommendation of Stephanie Meyer, author of the Twilight series of books even though this isn't the kind of book I typically would seek out at the library.  THANK YOU MS. MEYER! The Hunger Games had me engrossed from the first page.  I was very intrigued with the characters, especially Katniss, however, the development of all the characters was impressive. The complexity of each character was described so well that there really weren't any that I didn't love and hate at the same time.     The story itself is scary...to think that such a concept could be born and carried out is unsettling, but, unfortuantely believable.  I'm not a person who likes blood and gore and this book is sometimes violent and gory, however, not to the point that I was too grossed out to read on.  The romance added just enough additional struggle to keep me addicted.      I would classify The Hunger Games writing as excellent.  As you read you can easily visualize the characters and what's taking place. I am sooooo looking forward to the second book.
1401923119|5.0|This book is one of my most precious and cherished books.  I believe that this wonderful man has written the clearest and most inspiring book explaining what creative genious' we all are.  I loved his research, his ability to inspire, his remarkable ability to communicate and his enthusiasm which leapt off each page.  We are far more powerful than we ever realized and we have the absolute ability to change our lives by merely changing our thoughts and emotions.  Of course once you've read the book you are left with the question...how do I change my subconscious beliefs?  He likes the method of PsyK - there are numerous methods, but no magic bullet or technique.  In my opinion no one method fits all.  I think that once you realize that you can change your beliefs you will discover the best technique for you.  But first you have to open your eyes to the power within.  This book will clearly and absolutely open your eyes and inspire you.  This is a book too good to miss.
0743544676|3.0|I decided to get this audio after reading a junk book called the Player Slayer.  For some reason, this book came up after I made that purchase.  Anyway ...<br /><br />This was a fun audio to listen to.  It was very funny.  Comments such as \\"use your breakup period to meditate, buy selfhelp books, or murder\\" had me cracking up.<br /><br />I laughed through much of the audio.  As a result, I don't understand how the reviewers could take this book THAT serious.  It is clear that you are suppose to take from this book the general principle:<br /><br />****Don't waste time on a man that disrespects you, uses drugs or alcohol, keeps you waiting, and never calls when he states he is going to call.*****<br /><br />The above summarizes the whole book.  The rest of the book is fluff and I think that was made blatantly clear with the jokes and so forth.<br /><br />I pretty much agreed with the book, but I am torn on one issue.  Greg states NEVER call a guy or ask a guy out.  He also advices not to pursue a relationship with such a guy.  This causes a problem for me because I have met MANY men recently who stated that their fear of rejection keeps them from asking for numbers or asking someone out and, thus, appreciate when the woman makes the first move.  These me also, however, state that once the first move has been made by the woman that she needs to FALL BACK and let him finish the game.<br /><br />Therefore, Greg is right that men do love to win the chase; it is, however, debatable if women should initiate the chase or the man.<br /><br />I recommend this book for those women who date alcoholics, losers, drug heads and abusers.  This is the book clearly written for them.  Women with any sense will just find this book funny.<br /><br />Case in point: Don't date a married guy.  Well DUH!!<br /><br />A book, along this same line, is:[[ASIN:0741452073 Unlocking the Secrets of Internet Dating]]

B000002699|5.0|The rise of rock music in the late 1960s as the Boom Generation came of age had a profound influence on trumpeter Miles Davis. Eager to avoid being seen as trapped in a time-warp, but also unwilling to merely copy what rock artists were doing, over the course of the next five years Davis created a body of work that is by any standards his most lasting legacy and which led eventually to his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005/2006.<br /><br />In contrast to later works like [[ASIN:B0000027GU A Tribute to Jack Johnson]], \\"In a Silent Way\\" does not have any funky grooves or distorted electric guitar lines. Instead, the main instruments are three electric pianos, Davis' trumpet and Wayne Shorter's tenor saxophone, which combine to produce a sound that is remarkably slow, relaxed and touching all though the album's thirty-five minutes. Only very rarely does Davis' trumpet rise aboive the ambience of the pianos and occasional organ, but that does not detract from the flow on the first track \\"Shhh/Peaceful\\", which is really apt in its title given the furor of the time with the Vietnam War and the development of hard rock.<br /><br />On the second track, \\"In a Silent Way/It's About That Time\\", Davis' trumpet is much more prominent, but the undulating, slow, piano work that predates [[ASIN:B0000067X2 Future Days]]' use of this type of rhythms is still omnipresent. (Tony Williams' drumming is also something of a precursor to the more celebrated work of Jaki Liebzeit). The later part, \\"It's About That Time\\", is the nearest to \\"rock\\" but is still beautifully quiet and simple with the skeletal guitar lines doing no more than they have to. Near the end, akin to Future Days' title track, the band moves once more towards a more groove-oriented sound without losing the amazing flow of melody that had been achieved earlier on the record.<br /><br />All in all, \\"In a Silent Way\\" is an undoubted landmark that showed the use of rock instruments and recording techniques could achieve quite different effects - much more atmpsheric and melodic - that had ever been known before. From ambient to shoegaze, the influence of this recoridng cannot be doubted. Moreove,r the fact that it dented the Billboard Top 200 Pop Albums showed Davis' most important cultural role was only beginning.rent effects - much more atmpsheric and melodic - that had ever been known before.

B00005B58Y|4.0|Miles Davis' 1958 album MILESTONES is his last testament in the hard bop sound of the Fifties. Besides Davis on trumpet, it features Cannonball Adderley on alto saxophone, John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on double bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums.<br /><br />MILESTONES has often been overshadowed by the album released after it, KIND OF BLUE, which is often held up as the greatest jazz album of all time. However, MILESTONES features some strong performances. John Coltrane often steals the show, as the great saxophonist was here in the middle of his \\"sheets of sound\\" era where every solo came as a flurry of 16th notes. I have to admit, though, I never found Red Garland's piano playing as tight as that of other pianists who have worked with Davis, namely Herbie Hancock and Bill Evans. The album succeeds musically as well. The title track \\"Milestones\\" was Davis' first foray into the modal genre. The sextet's take on Thelonius Monk's \\"Straight, No Chaser\\" brings the jazz staple far beyond its origins. \\"Sid's Ahead\\" is probably the catchiest song Davis had written to date. Only \\"Billy Boy\\", a trio for piano, bass and drums, seems out of place among so much brilliance.<br /><br />It's a pity that Columbia reissued this with a few rejected takes, which breaks the flow of the album as originally conceived and which is obviously just advertising for Columbia's expensive box set of the complete sessions.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Miles' output of the '60s and '70s and rarely return to this. However, fans of more traditional jazz will probably find MILESTONES one of the best hard bop albums.
0596522347|5.0|Where to start?    Overall, this is probably one of the best books I've purchased for my own skills growth.  I give the occasional presentation and I'm just blown away now that I review my previous slideshows having this book's information in my head.    For me, just the information found in Chapter 7 (of 12) was worth the price of the book.  Don't know what Triadic or Tetradic color sampling are?  You will when you're done reading.  And the suggestions on the use of lighting an text feel common-sense now, but of course that's after reading this book.    The author includes a good mixture of Case Studies, with very simple examples from key companies and organizations that just hammer in the fact that there's so much to learn about proper slide design.    Add to this the discussion on the actual purposes of slideshows and I'm convinced that I can improve my presentations and make certain they fill the requirements of the audience and not my own.      Some random thoughts:    * Chapter 9 on Movement - short but sweet; I'm already trying to figure out how to incorporate some of these ideas into my slideshows.    * Chapter 4 on Data Presentation - another chapter that very well may be worth the price of the book.  If you use graphs in your slideshows, this chapter will open your eyes to what we do right and wrong.    *  Chapter 10 on Templates - Finally, some good advice on creating my own in-house standards that provide some consistency for my audience.    Overall, a 6-star book.  The layout is easy on the eyes, the writing style is simple and relevant, and the examples are plenty and to the point.  I wish I'd had this book in college and highly recommend it to any up-and-coming entrepreneurs who want to get attention.  Great job, Nancy Duarte.
055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Swords is incredibly entertaining and the best book of the series to date. The \\"issues\\" I had with the earlier two books (mainly the excessive, constant and gratutious sexual humiliation of women and other needless and bizarre hyper-sexual content directed at a 13 year old) which prevented me from giving them 5 stars are either gone or under control in this book. There is sex in this book but it isn't gratuitous - and therein lies the difference.     This book is nonstop action. The character development is interesting and on-point. This is one of the most entertaining books I have ever read in any genre. In short, I loved it and would recommend it highly. I suspect that fans of Martin will agree that this is the best of the series published to date.
0312427999|5.0|I would describe myself as reasonably  well informed, economically literate, a Wall Street investor and Democrat.  I found this book eye-opening, although  I believe Klein  is pushing a point of view which is frequently incorrect; e.g. privatization is not always bad, and Great Britain under Thatcher did achieve prosperity, while the Chinese middle class is vastly expanding. It is not so clear as Klein seems to imply that if the US had done the right things, the Iraqi invasion would have resulted in a democratic country.       What Klein does is draw lots of things together, and show the extent to which the extreme free market ideology of  Milton Friedman and his many disciples dominated US foreign policy in so many countries, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and also the conduct of government under George W. Bush.  Once again ideology, untempered by evidence and practicality, when given free reign, leads to disaster.  Many of the practitioners of this ideology were self serving and corrupt, or at least blinded by vanity, but clearly a man like Jeffery Sachs, who is currently doing his best as he sees it for the very poor countries, was genuine in his profession of his goals.     Here are a few of the things which are important and which I hadn't fully known, or known at all:  the use of torture to terrorize rather than extract information, and the early CIA interest in it;  what happened in Chile to the Allende regime and the Chilean people, with US participation, was not a singular event but was replicated in several other Latin American countries;  the pattern of foreign aid which relies on starting from scratch instead of taking advantage of local skills and resources, and the extent to which this occurred in Iraq and also in Sri Lanka and Lebanon; the extent of the waste and corruption in Iraq; how undemocratic Yeltsin was.

B001GKO45K|5.0|This is a valuable piece of history and it is a wonderful photographic essay.  As with all of Riefenstahl's work this is very beautiful. For those who think that nothing produced with the glad eye of the Nazis; this is the perfect tonic.    \\"I filmed the truth as it was then. Nothing more.\\"- Leni Riefenstahl.  If you choose to watch this film, think of it as an educational piece rather than an exciting feature film. Even though Hitler was a monster, as a public speaker he far surpasses any other world leader I've ever heard speak. If you have questions as to how Hitler persuaded people to jump on his bandwagon, this piece will enlighten you.    Riefenstahl's fascination with the naked human form is clear hear as young handsome German soldiers and Nazi volunteers are showed engaged half naked in strenuous outdoors activities. It is of course very beautiful but the knowledge that all viewers will have that soon the men giving shrieking melodramatic speeches would lead Germany to her near-doom and millions of human beings to their deaths will make this a frightening experience nonetheless.

B0013ND30M|5.0|Disney's SLEEPING BEAUTY is based upon the story of Briar Rose by the Brothers Grimm.  In this version of the tale, a beautiful baby girl named Aurora is born to a friendly king and queen.  After her birth people and creatures from all around come to give her gifts, including three good fairies.  Two of the fairies give their gifts to the child but before the third fairy is able to do so, an un-invited guest, the evil sorceress Malificient, appears and places a curse upon the child.  Before the end of Aurora's birthday she will prick her finger upon the spindle of a spinning wheel and die.  After Malificient leaves, the third fairy bestows her gift: instead of dying, Aurora will only fall into a deep slumber when the event happens and will only awaken with true love's kiss.  The fairies take Aurora and hide her and raise her deep in the woods as their own child.  When Aurora meets her true love, Prince Phillip, it would seem that everything is going to work out as planned.  But in fairy tales, even a Disneyized version of one, nothing is quite as it seems.<br /><br />SLEEPING BEAUTY had been in pre-production and production for almost a decade before it was originally released in theatres in 1958.  The film was incredibly expensive to make and had it failed it would have bankrupted the studio.  In fact, the film was so expensive that it was the last Disney animated picture to mostly have hand-drawn animated cells for each frame of the picture.  Xeroxing was king after that and a glory age of animation came to an end.  The film turned out to be a huge critical and financial success and remains as one of the most beautiful animated Disney features ever.  The influence of the movie can clearly be seen on modern animated pictures, most prominently Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST.  The movie also contains some very memorable Disney characters, including the most wicked of all Disney villains, Malificient.<br /><br />Besides the visual impact of the picture, the film is also notable for it's very un-Disney-like score.  The film was scored by an adaptation of George Bruns from Tchaikovsky's famous ballet, SLEEPING BEAUTY.<br /><br />As beautiful and stunning a movie that SLEEPING BEAUTY is, it has one major drawback.  Like all Disney animated pictures, the writers in adapting the original story failed to include some of the more dark and graphic parts of the story of Briar Rose, e.g. as the final confrontation between Malificient and Prince Phillip.  Other than that, though, SLEEPING BEAUTY is a meticulously-crafted example of the art of animation and one of the most beautifully drawn pictures ever to grace cinema screens.  Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Disney films or well-done animation.<br /><br />The special 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of the movie comes with two discs.  The first disc includes the movie in widescreen digitally restored format; \\"Once Upon a Dream\\" music video with Emily Osment; song selections that can be played with or without lyrics; a commentary with John Lasseter, Andreas Deja, and Leonard Maltin; \\"Princess Facts\\" (pop-up factoids that appear while watching the movie); the short pictorial GRAND CANYON (this was the short that originally accompanied SLEEPING BEAUTY in theatres); and a Walt Disney special entitled \\"Peter Tchaikovsky Story\\", which was the first tv program to be simulcast in widescreen picture and stereo sound<br /><br />The second disc is a special feature disc. It includes the documentary \\"Picture Perfect: Making of SLEEPING BEAUTY\\"; a featurette about Eyvind Earle; a featurette about how expensive the picture was to make; the original planned opening sequence of the movie; three deleted songs; two storyboard sequences; a virtual tour through the now closed Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland; a Disney special entitled \\"Four Artists Painting a Tree\\" (which is really just a long commercial for SLEEPING BEAUTY disguised as a show to encourage young artists); art galleries; trailers for the film; a matching game; and a language game.  I found the documentary about the making of the movie to be really interesting as well as the story about the history of the Sleeping Beauty Castle attraction at Disneyland.  I found the two games to be the least-interesting thing on the DVD.  Disney puts those things on there for young children, but I really think they are a waste of space and time.anguage game.

B00008DDRX|5.0|\\"Le Mans\\" is, as so many reviewers before me have suggested, a true, tried, and tested classic. The story of a racecar driver, played by the great Steve McQueen, who returns to participate in a race in which he was involved in a major accident the year before, is a simple one. Not many words are spoken and few plotlines are brought into play. Yet the film has more expression and more passion than the best and biggest of dramas. We get to explore the character and soul of the racing driver, get to see and feel the tension and concentration of the race.     Although the acting is somewhat 'simple', for lack of better words, the visual side of the film is overwhelmingly well thought out. The direction and camerawork is, at least in my opinion, very convincing. The actual driving, the epicenter of the film, is extremely good. In fact it is so good and, perhaps more pertinently, dangerous, that I believe we shant see the likes of it ever again on film (unless, of course, it will be as computerized special effects).     \\"Le Mans\\" is, however, not first and foremost a visual, but a visceral experience. The sound of the film is nothing, if not fantastic. The roaring engines, the absence of music, the roaring engines. Oh, and the cars sound very nice too. The feeling that the film doesn't favour this or that aspect of the racing experience. No 'fake' tension is built up. We sit there as casual observers to a truly magnificent event, listening, watching, experiencing all that is Le Mans.     I guess if you're not a petrolhead or are unusually empathic and creative, you'd probably think the pacing of the film a bit slow. If you, however, like a bit of speed and or sports (or drink petrol for breakfast) this film was made for you.
1400064287|5.0|A great source of inspiration for marketing professionals and anyone else who needs their message to stick.  In their organized approach to sticky communication, the brothers Heath take their own advice in writing a Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Story.  Okay, it wasn't that emotional, but they didn't stop there.    This book is full of interesting, useful, and practical insights for any marketing professional.  Five years or fifty, it's a must-read regardless of how long you've been in the industry.  For the less experienced, Dan and Chip cover the basics with insightful twists and thought provoking examples.  They take simple ideas, like proverbs, and break them down into easy to understand and, more importantly, reproducible thoughts.    For the seasoned professional, this book will make you take a step back, evaluate, and refocus your messages with questions like: \\"what's the core message?\\" and \\"are you a tapper?\\"  This `simplicity' (as other's have called it) of the book is a great strength.  Being in the business myself I find all too often messages drift from their core and become over complicated by organizations looking for their next award.    I live in the world of online and technology marketing so it is very important for me to make the most impact in the least amount of time.  Studies show that I have less than 10 seconds, most times less, to make enough impact on a potential customer that they want to stick around.  Made to Stick doesn't do it for you, but it does serve as a great inspiration and gives clear, simple guidelines to help you get it done.
0517548232|5.0|With all the bad theory and misinformation in the field of economics, Hazlitt's book serves a much-needed purpose. It teaches basic, self-evident principles that form the foundation for logical economic thought.    'Economics in One Lesson' should have perhaps been titled, 'Economic Policy in One Lesson', because Hazlitt is mainly concerned here with the effects of government policy on the market:    \\"...The whole of economics can be reduced to a single lesson, and that lesson can be reduced to a single sentence: The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"    Hazlitt's theorem is that much of our economic thought and government policy is based on fallacy. His method is to show an example of bad economic policy, explain how it adversely affects the market, and then teach good policy using logical reasoning. Along those lines, the book does not address basics such as supply and demand, but rather tackles questions like, \\"What is the effect of government credit on production?\\" Nonetheless, an absolute beginner should be able to understand the concepts presented here, even though the finer points may be lost. After reading this work, you will be able to analyze and evaluate economic policy and reason about its effects on the market.    Pay no heed to those that accuse Hazlitt of taking a narrow-minded, Libertarian viewpoint. Regardless of your economic/political affiliations, the truths presented in this book are so self-evident that, in my opinion, they are defensible on common sense alone and demonstrated throughout history.
B00007J36V|5.0|It is unfortunate that most of the music on the air during the 60's where I lived was mainstream top 40 music.  Only in the early 70's did one station appear in my area that called itself \\"an underground\\" station.  They often played music of The Grateful Dead and other San Francisco bands that listeners seldom heard in this corner of the West.  The station's format had fewer commercials, and they played more \\"album rock.\\"  But I never had a chance to hear Fairport Convention.  I loved the Judy Collins cover of \\"Who Knows Where The Time Goes\\" without knowing that she didn't write it.  When I heard Sandy Denny's original for the first time in June of '08, I had to have this CD.  This song is hauntingly beautiful and the guitar work is superb.  The rest of the album is also peaceful.  Each song has this folk quality that few groups successfully achieve.  And the guitar work on the entire album often reminds me of early Jefferson Airplane, before some of their members lost their edge and departed to continue other projects.  All of the songs on this CD are sophisticated and thought-provoking.  It is remarkable--a must have for anyone who really has a passion for music and loves something that brings you peace.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Excelente disco, Metallica, volvio a sus acordes q lo hicieron famoso entre los metaleros. con un toque de modernismo.. me parece lo mejor del Heavy Metal hoy en dia, un disco q debera de ser galardonado, premmiado .. esperamos los videos sean tan buenos como el disco. pero altamente recomendable. al que le guste Metallica desde sus inicios.. este disco le va a encantar..por mi 5 estrellas..

B0019T9FL6|2.0|Wow, didn't we all have high expectations for this CD.  Ms. Hudson is lucky to have won an Oscar ~ if not, this CD would be in the bargain bins tomorrow assuming she could have garnered a record deal without it.  Yep, she's got a promising voice but her team really misguided the machine and the final product is a mish mash of yelling, screaming, hollering, etc.  Okay, it has its moments but I fear her singing career (as a recording artist) is off to a hugely bumpy start.    What a huge letdown.  Huge.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|\\"Groundhog Day\\" is one of Bill Murray's best efforts.  To think that a movie could repeat the same day over and over and over again and still be interesting is amazing and a credit to Murray's ability to draw viewers in.  It turns out to be a sweet film of romance and I highly recommend it!  Damon Medic
B000VPUIA6|4.0|I remember when this DVD set sold for about $179.00; I purchased it new from Amazon for $29.95.  I'd like to know: why so cheap?  Was it a mistake?  It's now selling for $80.00 on this site.....feels like the stock market to me.
B0019T9FL6|4.0|In an earlier review, I stated that Jennifer's New CD, (a few songs anyway), were a bit boring.  Now that I've had a real chance to listen more and more to her CD, I find that her CD is WONDERFUL!  I do think that is was RUSHED A BIT. BUT SHE IS AWSOME!!!! HER CD IT GREAT, GREAT GREAT.  I  SIMPLY LOVE HER DUET'S!!! JENNIFER HUDSON DESERVES ALL THE ACCLAIM FOR HER SUCCESS!! SHE IS GREAT!  I LOVE #4, #5 THE CD IS GREAT.  AGAIN, I STAND CORRECTED!!!!!<br /><br />1ST REVIEW!!!<br /><br />I really have to say to Jennifer:  TAKE A BOW!  You have indeed made your dreams come true!  The CD is GREAT,  a few of the songs are great with a few more that are not so good.  Don't get me wrong, I am not dissing this album.  I just think that some of her songs are boring.  I love Jennifer and wish her all the luck and success that she derseves!!!<br />MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE CD IS #4 (Giving Myself).  Listen to it!  It is<br />b e a u t i f u l! By the way, I also like #5 (What's Wrong) and of course the song ( I'm his only Woman) with the ever talented FANTASIA!

1596434252|5.0|I was in awe when I opened this amazing pop-up book.  It is a three-dimensional look at the alphabet that stands alone in excellence. The cover is holographic. You are intrigued right away as your eyes feast upon a shiny red cover that changes its letter upon movement, but the real pleasure awaits you inside the pages of this work.<br /><br />Within you will find the alphabet set before you with the most imaginative use of paper that I have ever seen. With the flick of your hand or the movement of a page one letter will turn into another, one spins around, the letter B slides out to greet you. Every page is an exciting surprise, an adventure for your mind and a morsel of delight for your eyes. Children learning their alphabet will be encouraged to look at this book over and over again.  It has a drawing power like none other that I have seen.  Adults as well will not be able to resist the urge to study each letter and be in awe at the imagination of this author.<br /><br />I am impressed and am proud to give this book a hearty recommendation.  New invocative work that every household would benefit from having, definitely an investment that will continue to bring pleasure and learning for years to come.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My wife and I have loved David McCullough's books \\"John Adams\\" and \\"1776\\" for years.  The script, acting, photography, costumes and sets in this presentation do a truly wonderful job of bringing this wonderful epic in American history to life.  By the end of the 3-DVDs you really feel like you know and empathize with all of the individuals portrayed.  We also enjoyed the add-on segment on David McCullough's life as a historian and writer very much.  We will treasure this movie for years to come.
0307383415|5.0|Out of all the autobiographies I've read of prominent men and women, and particularly those wih political ambition and desire for high office, I don't think I've ever read anything as frank and straightforward as this  book of Obama's.  Writing about oneself is difficult for most people most of the time, and here, describing one's childhood (or bi-racial childhood as Americans often say) involves displaying whatever conclusions you've reached as you assenbked your emotional and intellectual self, in different parts of this country, and in Indonesia, and that must surely have been profoundly difficult.    Considering the high level of education Obama's achieved, that the book is written well should be no surprise.  But what is so amazing about all this is that currently the election campaign of Obama's Republican opponent is attempting to encourage the voting public that there is an impenetrable veil of mystery surrounding candidate Obama; mystery about his morals, his political affiliations, his religious obligations..  It seems obvious to me that anybody in this country or this world could find the man revealed with maximum clarity simply by reading this exceptional book.  The latest Republican hocus-pocus is nonsense.  It depends on the shameful racist tradition that says no white person can ever accept any level of intimacy -- certainly not an equitable one -- with any person of color, and that understanding would be a breach of caste.    We will be reading this splendid book for many years, both as adults and as students and children.  It will become a young people's library classic.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I am one of those fans who has found some form of enjoyment from every Metallica album, save St. Anger, which was just a mess. I was not overly optimistic about Death Magnetic, but after listening to it a dozen times, I can say that it is one of their best albums, and one of the best metal albums of the last few years.     Gone are the radio-friendly 4 minute hard rock songs of the Load/Reload era, and gone are the messy attempts of St. Anger.  What we have here is Metallica reborn into the late 80s/early 90s.  The songs sound like a lot of work went into each one, and I did not find any dull moments. When a band waits as long as they do between cds, this is exactly the type of album fans should get: one that has no filler, and can be enjoyed straight through.    There is plently of variety in the songs, ranging from ballads (The Day That Never Comes) to thrash (My Apocalypse) to fast-tempo, groove-filled head-bangers (That Was Just Your Life). There really is a lot to like, and shows some promise again for the future. 4.5/5 stars.
6304806434|5.0|Con Air is a good movie with decent action and acting.  It has drama, some dry humor and even a bit of romance.  Nicholas Cage and John Malkovich are really great as adversaries.  The only thing that I would change about this movie is Nic's southern accent.  It's okay but a bit too twangy.  Other than that, it's a fantastic movie.  I could watch it again and again.
B000000OEI|3.0|Like many Hans Zimmer soundtracks, this one is all Zimmer. It has that Zimmer feel, and as such it is interchangeable with the rest. Heard Gladiator? Well, you've heard this too, at least in part. And the other part? Well, the best parts of this score, in my opinion, are those that seem to borrow very very heavily from the hymn \\"For Those in Peril on th Sea\\" which is the hymn of the US Naval Academy and often played at sailors memorial services.     So. Lacking in originality in so many ways, but well executed and pleasant to listen to. But not the best way to spend your money.
B000WBZ5M0|5.0|I really enjoy the chemistry of the actors in the prior Oceans movies and 13 is no exception.  George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, Elliout Gould, Andy Garcia, et. al. have an amazing working relationship.  The storyline of Oceans 13 is clever and entertaining.  It's well written and has a mix of intrigue, comedy and heart felt emotion.  I hope they make a 14.
0439023483|5.0|I admit, being 27, I felt a tad silly picking up this book (at least Harry Potter was thick - it felt adult).  I have read it twice in full and I have returned to re-read parts more than a few times.  Incredible.  The main character is sparsely, yet realistically written.  She is both known and unknown to us, and to herself, as so many are at sixteen.  The book is not gory by any means and the Hunger Games are over after the first book, so it will be interesting to see what happens next.
B0019GOT2Y|5.0|This album is amazing.....the band has grown in their musicianship and lyric writing.  Its harder then Us & Them....which is still a great album ..even if it was tamer and radio friendly.  This album starts out with a bang and then lulls you in with the standard ballads....but the ballads are still great, great lyrics and singing.  The hard rockers on the album are fist pumping headbanging anthems that would sound great in any arena. The song What A shame is truly a magnifcant song...and really shows Brents southern rock bloodline.   Even though compared to STP by themselves and others...i find that the songs and lyrics are much better then anything STP ever did.  The regular album is a bit short at 41 minutes so it is nice to have the 3 extra songs on the LE version.
039472903X|4.0|This is, I believe, the first book about advertising<br />I read... many years ago.  Ogilvy is a smooth writer<br />and this is an easy read.<br /><br />Lost of examples of successful display advertisements<br />and crowing about his successes.  He's not that humble.<br /><br />Drayton Bird ran Ogilvy Direct - the division of O&M<br />that handled the ghetto of direct response marketing<br />- which is what all us internet guys do.  Bird's<br />stuff is even better, IMO, more specialized.<br />Drayton Bird, Ogilvy's employee, is more of a working<br />stump... the kind of guy who has been kicked around<br />a lot in direct response and lived to tell the tale<br /><br />Ogilvy successfully created slogans and brands. He<br />wrote some grand headlines.  He's an icon and was for<br />many, many years of his own lifetime.  His book is<br />sort of written from an Ivory tower I think.  I'm<br />noy saying he was out of touch,  just that he was<br />so successful in general at the time he wrote the<br />book that one would think he farted perfume.<br /><br />Don't take me too seriously.  Ogilvy on Advertising<br />is great, especially for full-page display ad copy.
0671799320|5.0|The Prize is a feast of a book. It is one of my all time favorites, including novels, biographies and the lot. Daniel Yergin, the author, makes a very exciting plot of the history of the oil business, starting in Pennsylvania in 1859.<br /><br />The best parts, both analytical and epical, is where he writes about the upstream part of the oil business, ie. exploring, finding and producing crude. The story takes us from Pennsylvania, to Texas, Indonesia, Russia, Venezuela, Mexico, Persia, Kuwait and Saudi-Arabia to Alaska.<br /><br />Yergins main thesis is that oil became a strategic commodity around 1900. Nations and governments want control over crude, because they are unable to conduct wars without it. Therefore they are willing to go to war to secure oil supplies, and availability of oil determined to a certain extent the outcome of WWII.<br /><br />The book is also a very good account on general world history between 1859 and 1991. Interesting and fun anecdotes flourish, but Yergin is still keeping the analytical banner high. Fantastic book!

B0013ND30M|5.0|The Sleeping Beauty story never gets old, no matter how old you are or how long ago you saw it. But this Platinum Edition brings out the best in the story with a great-looking digitally restored picture, making it now even harder to forget with colors that jump at you. If you can watch the movie on a widescreen TV you will enjoy it at its fullest as it was the first one that Disney did on 70 mm film.<br /><br />Alongside the unforgettable tale, there are lots of extra material packing the two discs, such as children games, a great documentary on the making of the movie and even a short on the life of Tchaikovsky (whose music is featured on the film) that make this package a must have for Disney fans.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Dreamworks has enjoyed a commercially successful, but critically questionable run of animated films. In the midst of the Shrek Trilogy, Over the Hedge, and Curse of the WereRabbit lie Shark's Tale, Sinbad, and Spirit.<br />The studio seems to be fumbling for the secret ingredient - well, here they've found it.<br />Kung Fu Panda takes full advantage of the animation medium, staging fantastic fights and great physical comedy. There is a lot of heart to it, a real sincerity underneath the big studio behemoth. The character design is the best of any Dreamworks film - especially the title character. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman are a good chemical fit, but the other big name actors are wasted with characters who maybe utter 10 lines or less.<br />A film only gets four stars if it's well-crafted, but it can only get five it's all that AND personally touching.  I give it five stars.<br /><br />The video game to this film is just as entertaining and fun as the film - which is rare. Not bad for a movie game.<br /><br />I'm a little hesitant about it's sequel.  I don't know where else these characters can go after such a dramatic change?
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I purchased this Blu-Ray movie from BB. I was worried about the \\"loading\\" issues many people have talked about on Amazon as well as other forums. Well I found out that only the initial shipment of Iron Man Blu-Ray suffered from problems loading. The disc attempts to connect online via the PS3 and download content from a server onto your players hard-drive. People were having issues because (1) the servers were over-loaded and (2) the initial batch of discs would attempt to download content without asking for permission first.    The discs have all been replaced and now upon insertion, you will be asked if you want to connect online and download content. I selected \\"YES\\" and 1.5 minutes later, I was in the menu ready to watch the movie.    The movie is fantastic and well worth the purchase! Robert D Jr. gives a perfect performance and the special effects will blow your mind.    Don't worry about anything and pick it up! You'll love it!

B000XO2R22|5.0|Buried in most of Beck's music is actual ability to write songs and melody, once you strip away all those loops and trickery, songs are buried under there. Sea Change brings all this to the front with perhaps one of the best breakup albums ever written, and I say this owning albums going back 40 years and over 8,000 songs in my iTunes library. Sea Change never feels old, never feels dated, and is a brilliant late night album to put on and just ponder. I'd give it six stars if I could, it's that good.

B000O1799U|4.0|(written by Leigh's wife):  I had been looking forward to seeing this for quite a while, but couldn't find a Widescreen copy.  I was interested in seeing if it was all it was hyped up to be.  I was particularly interested in seeing the performances by Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles and, of course, Jennifer Hudson.<br /><br />My opinions:<br /><br />I do not like Jamie Foxx as a comedian; however, he is definitely growing on me as a dramatic actor!  Seeing him in this and, more recently, \\"The Kingdom\\", he is impressive.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that Jennifer Hudson is thumbing her nose at those stupid \\"American Idol\\" people.  She was fantastic!  She could be both tough and naive at the same time.  She impressed me; she deserved her Oscar.<br /><br />Beyonce is beautiful.  Her singing is OK; I'm glad that her character in the movie was admitted as not a strong singer, but more asthetically pleasing.  She seemed to be playing to type.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy...what a disappointment.  I will admit that I have never, ever liked him (I have ONLY liked him in \\"Mulan\\").  He is very much a one-note performer.  All he was doing was channelling his famous SNL \\"Hot Tub\\" skit.  His speech pattern, short and choppy, got extremely annoying after a while.  I would have liked to have seen someone else - ANYONE else - in this role.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and it was worth the purchase.

While I will admit that this isn't exactly Academy Award material, I don't understand the distain and dislike that most people have shown for it.<br /><br />DEFINITELY only for adults!

B001F7MSFW|5.0|Guillermo Del Toro has become the new master of dark fantasy -- first with the quirky clockpunk \\"Hellboy,\\" then with the Oscar-winning \\"Pan's Labyrinth.\\" Not to mention forthcoming travels to Middle-Earth.<br /><br />So you know he has the skills to pit Mike Mignola's scarlet anti-hero against an army of fairies and elves, and not make it silly. Instead, it's a spectacular dark fantasy full of humor, action, quirky appeal, romance, and some truly astounding special effects. But what really shoves this movie over the top is Del Toro's brilliant direction, and the stunning performance by Ron Perlman.<br /><br />Decades ago, Professor Broom (William Hurt) told a small Hellboy a yuletide bedtime story about the Elf King Balor and his unstoppable Golden Army, and how the crown that controls the Army was split into thirds and divided among fairies and humans.<br /><br />Well, you can't really expect that kind of power to never be revived.<br /><br />Cut to current day. Hellboy (Perlman), Liz (Selma Blair) and Abe (Doug Jones) investigate a strange supernatural attack on an auction house, where the archeological curiosity known as the Crown of Bethmoora was being sold -- only to be attacked by savage tooth fairies. Turns out the crown was stolen by Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), a resentful young elf who is determined to take the world back from humanity -- using, of course, the Golden Army.<br /><br />And while Hellboy chafes against strict new commander Johann Krauss (a suit filled with ectoplasm), Abe encounters Nuada's sister, Princess Nuala -- who also happens to have the last third of the crown. But Nuada will not allow anyone to oppose him as he searches for the Golden Army's location, and Hellboy and his friends must venture into a strange, ancient kingdom to stop him from destroying all of humanity.<br /><br />The worst you can say about \\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is that it sticks to the formula of the demonic outsider with a dark destiny, and his continuing romantic woes. There's some retreading as Hellboy realizes anew that he'll never fit into the world of humans, because he's big and red and has horns and a tail. Okay, we got it. Next big psychological issue!<br /><br />Fortunately those flaws are relatively minor ones. Del Toro is still able to spin a dark, twisted story with some truly bizarre creatures (the utterly alien, eye-winged Angel of Death), clockpunk robots, trippy underground goblin markets and a new BPRD agent who is basically ectoplasm in a suit. And for the action scenes, Del Toro does not pull punches when it comes to the smashing action scenes -- giant thrashing vines and a one-on-one duel with Nuada are among the highlights.<br /><br />With all this going on, it would be easy to neglect the characters. But Del Toro packs the script with solid snappy dialogue and some poignantly romantic moments -- including some pretty startling actions from dear ol' Abe. And he also adds little moments to this epic story that remind us that these are supposed to be people -- such as Hellboy's bickering with Krauss, or Abe and Hellboy getting drunk and having a little Manilow singalong together. It's just so cute.<br /><br />But what really sets this movie apart is the \\"children of the Earth.\\" No flitting Victorian sprites -- these are creatures that are weird, grotesque, dangerous and immensely powerful, from nasty little tooth fairies up to vast rock monsters and plant gods. There's an alien, bizarre aesthetic to these creatures that feels wholly real, as if Neil Gaiman casually dropped a few sketches onto the drawing board.<br /><br />But as amazing as the visuals are, Del Toro never neglects the characters. Perlman is perfect for the role of \\"big Red\\" -- he's gruff, sarcastic, moody, but also endearing and self-deprecatingly likable. There are more hints of his potentially dark future, and he faces some delicately-handed temptations. But Big Red's good heart is still very much in the forefront, no matter how much human beings fear him.<br /><br />Blair gives a more lively performance here as a spunkier Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store. Jones is pitch-perfect as the fish-man, who experiences the first pangs of young love for Nuala, while Goss gives a chilling, whispery performance as a rebel prince who is willing to do whatever it takes -- even kill family -- if it helps him restore the fey kingdom. Pretty good villain, since he clearly isn't trying to be bad.<br /><br />There's also loads of extras in this particular edition of the movie -- feature commentary with director Guillermo Del Toro, Jeffrey Tambor, Selma Blair and Luke Goss, as well as some deleted scenes also with commentary with Del Toro, a prologue to the movie, a digital script, image gallery, a \\"Puppet Theatre\\" for the opening sequences of the film, concept art, interviews, and other such stuff. Also making-of documentaries -- seven mini-documentaries that visit the set, the \\"Troll Market Tour\\" in the movie's most memorable \\"faerie\\" setting, and the two-hour \\"Hellboy: In Service Of The Demon.\\" Basically, it turns the film inside-out and lets you examine its guts.<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II: The Golden Army\\" is a wild, darkly ornate ride through the world of half-forgotten gods and fey. While it has a few flaws, those are far outweighed by the brilliant of Del Toro's vision.Liz, who also has some surprising developments in store.

0451531051|5.0|Most people know that Edgar Allen Poe wrote poetry. Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to make them quote a line that doesn't involve ravens.<br /><br />Well, it's time for some poetry homework -- \\"The Raven\\" is neither Poe's most beautiful nor his most striking poem. That is reserved for other, more obscure works in Poe's \\"Complete Poetry\\" -- and while one might expect the ghostly or macabre to be all throughout his work, it's also filled with transcendent beauty, wistfulness, and some truly amazing wordwork.<br /><br />Over his lifetime, Poe tried out many styles -- there are sonnets, short hymns, long rambling odes written in dramatic, vaguely Shakespearean style (\\"O, human love! thou spirit given/On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!\\"), acrostics, little exercises in self-reflection, a lyrical song or two, and some haunting stories rendered in verse like the bittersweet \\"Annabel Lee.\\"<br /><br />And the content of these poems is just as diverse. Some of them are distinctly dark -- sunken cities, tolling bells, haunted palaces, thoughts on the lingering spirits of the dead, abandoned valleys, and loved ones that have been stolen away by death (\\" I pray to God that she may lie/For ever with unopened eye/While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!\\"). And yes, it has the one about a midnight dreary, and a creepy raven with eyes like \\"a demon's that is dreaming.\\"<br /><br />And there are a lot of moments of beauty -- lush descriptions of nature, bittersweet dreams, love for a beautiful girl, and elfin odes to those who \\"put out the star-light/With the breath from their pale faces/About twelve by the moon-dial...\\" But in many of these, Poe manages to add a melancholy atmosphere -- just look at \\"Bridal Ballad,\\" whose narrator assures us that she is happy, but who is haunted by the \\"dead who is forsaken,\\" her former lover.<br /><br />Yeah, Poe's verse tends to be about as cheerful as his best known fiction, and often with some of the same preoccupations. He was a little less successful in verse at times, as occasionally you get some very strained verse schemes, like the terribly awkward \\"Eulalie\\" (\\"Now Doubt - now Pain/Come never again/For her soul gives me sigh for sigh\\").<br /><br />But like his stories, Poe's poems are spun out of exquisite, dreamlike words that can sometimes evolve into nightmares. This guy could evoke everything from ghosts to fairy-tales, brides to wormlike horrors. Even the more sentimental moments have a dark edge (\\"Oh, may her sleep/As it is lasting, so be deep!/Soft may the worms about her creep!\\"). And he also wraps his verse in some truly beautiful natural metaphors -- ancient forests, flowers, misty moons, and many other beautiful touches.<br /><br />And Poe's poetry even allows a window into his own mind at times, most painfully expressed as \\"from childhood's hour I have not been/As others were -- I have not seen/As others saw -- I could not bring/My passions from a common spring...\\" and the \\"mystery which binds me still.\\"<br /><br />For anyone who can appreciate his exquisite use of words, the \\"Complete Poetry of Edgar Allen Poe\\" is a must-read -- full of dark, meditative little gems and exquisite language.you get some very strained verse schemes, like the terribly awkward \\"Eulalie\\" (\\"Now Doubt - now Pain/Come never again/For her soul gives me sigh for sigh\\").

0307387178|5.0|This book was amazing. It goes much further into the idealism of \\"going into the wild\\" then the story of Alex himself; unlike the movie. Recommend to any person ever willing to pass on the idea of society and return to our roots.
0807014273|5.0|This book was suggested as recommended reading in Daniel Pink's book \\"Whole new mind\\".  I found it so inspiring that I had to purchase 3 copies; one for myself and two for friends.  It gives perspective to life and why we are here.    It's incredible to read the insight of a man who lived through the horrors of Auschwitz and Dachau and is able to write about it with such clarity and wisdom. In particular his perspective as a psychologist living through this time is extremely insightful.  I have suggested this book to a few people now; a definite for those needing stories of resilience.
B00005JPO1|4.0|As the Indiana Jones we all know and love, Harrison certainly did not dissapoint. He looked great, the action sequences were as great as we've come to expect from Indi, and non stop all the way. But the ending ! I could have come to terms with aliens as some contact with the past civilisation, but coming to life, and the saucer taking off ? I didn't get it, and it seemed downright silly.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these to monitor audio on my videocamera.  They seal out ambient sound very well -- in fact, I have trouble hearing anything someone says to me in a normal speaking voice with these headphones on.<br /><br />Sound is crisp and flat, just what I wanted to monitor audio.
0060723513|5.0|This succinct, accessible, and fascinating book is truly a journey about and of self-discovery.  I read it twice within a week's time: the first was a page-turner; the second, more contempletive, thoughtful, and at an intensly slower pace.  I will undoubtedly re-read it several more times, for the basic principles are pertinant to daily life and worth recalling when occaisionally smudged by \\"daily life.\\"  It is worth carrying with me.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I thought this garlic press was a little over priced when I got it, but I had a gift certificate so I decided to go ahead and splurge.  After 4 months, I am very glad I got it and I think it's well worth the price.  It's very sturdy and the weight of the handles helps make it easier to press the garlic.  The fact that the part with the little holes swings out so you can get to every corner to clean it is really nice too.  It even goes fine in the dishwasher.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book as much as the previous three. I would not have been happy if Edward and Bella did not end up living 'happily ever after'. End of story.
B001F0ORDU|3.0|I loved this show and still watch the DVD's or catch episodes on Youtube or TBS. I kept saying to myself how I much I missed the show. And was excited when the movie was green lit. The movie picks up four years after the show ended.  I thought Samantha had the least to do and as payback for delaying the making of the movie, was made to get fat. No, not sure if that's true or not, but makes you wonder.  Charlotte didn't have much to add either, except squeal, get pregnant and poop her pants. Miranda had some great scenes with Carrie & Steve. I liked the scenes between Carrie and her assistant.  The movie was a bit long but it was good seeing the girls again, and of course all the high fashion.  It wouldn't be SATC without the high fashion.  I didn't like the bit parts for characters Stanford & Anthony. And what happened to Marcus??  There  are some hits and misses with the movie, most SATC fans will enjoy it.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|December 9, 2008    This is an update of my original review. Since that time, I have purchased the special 3 disc set and now its Blu-Ray version! Both look great on an HDTV and the Blu-Ray version is VERY clear!     As for the film itself, let me tell you it will make you forget about the 2003 film Hulk! While the TV version with the late Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno will always be the Hulk to me, this is the way you should do the comic Hulk!    These guys definitely took the best from both the TV show and the comics and blended them together into one great film. This film definitely gets a 5 star rating from me for non-stop action and a little bit of drama and storytelling. While I am sure everyone knows, it ties into the recent Iron-Man release. Perhaps a showdown between the two on the big screen soon? We'll see!    Back to this, the transformations are great and they make more sense here than in Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003. While the Hulk did get stronger as he got angrier, I don't recall any version of him growing due to the rage! That made it a bit ridiculous to me. Here, he stays a consistent size and it just as menacing and scary at times. The villian Emil Blonsky (The Abomination) is much better than the villian in Hulk (though Nick Nolte did do a good job with what he had in 2003) and an actual threat to The Hulk.    Overall, this won't be a waste of your money, no matter what version you get! This is a must buy for comic fans and action junkies!
B000NY1EJE|4.0|I got this in Iraq because it gets boring during our downtime and so we spend our free time buying movies and CD's as a past time.  I didn't buy the original release of this, but the added DVD with all the videos made it worth while. I only liked a few songs, but after a few hearings, I started to like more. My favorites are the \\"Get Me bodied, Extended Mix\\" and \\"Upgrade U\\"!
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Let me say up front that I am a big fan of the Indiana Jones series. I really wanted to love this film but I couldn't completely! It isn't a bad film but it definitely falls short of the first three.    The first hour or so of the movie is probably the best of this film. After that, the plot goes downhill though I have to admit I found myself enjoying the chase through the jungle!     The Crystal Skull legend I did find interesting. I hope there is some special about those because I understand they really exist but no one knows how they were made or where they come from. Back to the film, it goes downhill when Marion (Indy's love in the first film) shows up. I don't know why but she just didn't add much to this film this time other than rekindling her romance with Dr. Jones.    Shil LeBeuf is okay as Indy's son (a fact not revealed until later in the movie) but I don't know if he's interesting enough to have his own film series. The best thing about this film is actually Harrison himself. His performance as Indiana Jones is still very good. I just wished he would've had a better story!    Overall, I would recommend this one as a rental or buy at a reduced price. For me, I am waiting until they re-release all of them on blu-ray in one set and get them then! Not a bad film but definitely the weakest of the four.
B001GAPC1K|3.0|I purchased the Iron Man blu-ray and it is missing the scene after Stark shows off the new weapon.  He gets into the hummer, doesn't let his buddy in, saying this is the fun vehicle.  In the movie, he talks with the soldiers and drinks.  On my disc, it doesn't have any of that.  The next scene shows the vehicle blowing up and him having surgery in the cave.    What's up with that?
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The quality of the video's are excellent, the packaging is superb. I really enjoy the fast delivery which makes it worthwhile to order from the website. I give Amazon four stars for great service. Thank you very much.
B000TEUSJU|5.0|There are two reactions to this film: 1. \\"I absolutely HATED it!\\" and 2. \\"I absolutely LOVED the sex in that movie!!!!\\". EIther way you cannot deny- this film, meant to be good, was edited badly.<br /><br />SHORT ATTENTION SPAN SUMMARY:<br /><br />1. Thought of as a surreal black comedy<br />2. Scripted as a homoerotic political satire<br />3. Shot as an erotic mindflip of a movie<br />4. Edited as a disaster<br />5. Released as a disaster.<br /><br />What could have been a great film was ruined by one man: Bob Guccione. Tinto Brass and Gore Vidal had shot 95% of the footage, and Bob GUccione had shot about 5 hours of \\"sexy\\" material to make this a \\"T-ts-and-arse-and-gore\\", 6 minutes of which had ended up in the movie. He then went to edit an AWESOME satire of Caligula's atrocities into a disaster of a movie. The acting was great, and Malcom McDowell outdid himself as Caligula. The film has many great scenes, including the nervous breakdown from Caligula. Gore Vidal and Tinto Brass had disowned the film because Bob Guccione would lock Tinto Brass outside the editing room. If the film had been edited properly, It would have been a great film.<br /><br />The recut version on this DVD has scenes edited back the way they were meant to be edited, but 5 quick Gooch inserts were left in by a mistake. It's worth watching though. And the film must be seen to be believed. You may love it, you may hate it. I know I didn't hate it or love it.<br /><br />Overall, this gets a 5/5 for what it could have been, but for what it ended up, it gets a 1/5.
B001E75QGG|4.0|This film is excellent.It has everything you could ever expect from an Indy movie.Great acting,top script,superb directing and overall brilliant atmosphere.A must have for all indy fans.I must say i am rather disappointed with Amazon's release date for this title.I was wondering around New York on the 5th of October 2008 and found this title on Blu Ray at a random retail dvd store and picked it up.Amazon needs to sort out their release dates asap !!!!!!
0812932293|5.0|Nicely written entertaining book giving an inside perspective about Richard Barnsons life. The descriptions of his early twenties are dominated by explanations about various sexual escapades. Further one, he provides other details about his life which are truly inspiring.
B000001EXB|5.0|It's unlikely that a mature composer, even one as great as EJ, can make such an excellent album.    But this is truly inspired stuff, not a rehashing of a well-known musical language.    And if it doesn't hit you immediately, keep listening. The reward is worthy.
B000002JSN|3.0|I like this record in the sense of it's length and classical leanings (namely Baroque), but it's production value is something to be desired.  On the majority of the tracks Bonham's drums lack the strong \\"thump\\" that I've grown so accustomed to.  They are on the edge of being demos.  One positive note: \\"In the Light\\" is probably the most underrated Zep songs, so that alone is grounds for a purchase.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I've been waiting to buy this cd for the longest time and it was worth the wait... remembering all the old songs took me back many years when life was simpler and I was much younger...each song reminds me of a different chapter in my life..... thanks for the trip back down memory lane
B000002AGB|2.0|Everything about this release is wrong, except for the content.  Maybe if the sound was recompressed, remixed and washed out a couple of times it might be tolerable.  It seems most of The Who's punch from \\"Live at Leeds\\" was lost in the open air of this festival.  I've heard better bootlegs, but not to say that this recording is \\"dirty\\", because it's not.  If anything is too quiet, clean and tired.  I'd pass.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have never really been a Metallica fan, but I decided to buy this album, and I can say that it was well worth every penny.  I like every song on this cd, mainly because they are relentless on every track, yet they make riffs that keep you listening for the whole seventy minutes.  Even the 10 minute instrumental, Suicide and Redemption, has made it from beginning to end several times in my cd player.  Any metal fan should without question pick up this masterpiece.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|\\"The Lives of Others\\" was the best foreign language film I have seen in a long time.  Directed and written by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (in his debut, no less) and starring Ulrich Muhe, \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a quiet thriller set in the former Soviet Sector of East Berlin.  Muhe, who plays a Stasi Captain assigned to monitor a would-be subversive playright(Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend (Martina Gedeck) via audio bug from their attic.  Muhe, who soon discovers his assignment is less than as it seems, aids an unknowing Koch and Gedeck by creating mis-information to feed to his superiors, allowing the two below to freely construct a magazine article, politically devastating to the East.  I'll try not to give away anymore, but the ending has one of the most moving double entendres the movies have to offer.  (This includes all Bond films, by the way.)
B001CLG6RC|4.0|Okay. Being a fan of Enigma since 1990 when I was 14 and first saw the Sadeness video, I've fallen in love with most of the albums. Enigma is one of those rare groups that captivate my attention with each successive album, the exception being A Posteriori. I've read the reviews and have listened to it multiple times, but still have not been able to appreciate it as much as the others. But with Seven Lives Many Faces, there are many elements which are reminiscent of previous albums, but with some new things added which, to me, were surprisingly refreshing.     I didn't give this album 5 stars for two reasons: As other reviewers have stated, many of the songs on Seven Lives are more simple than the Enigma fare a lot of us are used to, relying too much on repetitive lyrics in certain songs and not having multiple layered elements in others.    That being said, while I didn't enjoy this album as much as the first five, I still liked it quite a lot. I have a great deal of respect for artists who branch out to try new things, and Michael Cretu is no exception. (And while A Posteriori falls flat for me, I still appreciate what was done with it.) I would recommend this album to any Enigma fan, and anyone with an interest in moving, relaxing ambient music.
B00003CX9S|5.0|The film opens under the tent of a circus. The Elephant Man is the main attraction of the freak shows. A physician, Dr. Frederick Treves (Anthony Hopkins), passes through a menagerie of Siamese twins, strongmen, fat women, pickled abortions, etc., until he arrives at the Elephant Man's tent. Treves pays the carnival barker, Bytes (Freddie Jones), a fee for a private exhibition of the Elephant Man. Bytes leads Treves into the Elephant Man's tent. It's dark inside. The Elephant Man peeks out of the shadows. Treves is astonished.  He leases the Elephant Man from Mr. Bytes.  The Elephant Man transforms a wing of the London hospital into a freak show, and Treves is the circus barker as he catalogues the Elephant Man's deformed body. The physician waves over the reeking bags and nasty testicle-like sacs lapping out of John's back. The physician waves over the huge fibrous globes displacing John's skull; the physician waves over the swollen twisted chain of John's vertebrae.<br /><br />In some, John inspires fear; in others, he inspires sympathy. His deformed body is a funhouse mirror, returning the ugliness of those who gaze at him, beat him, and exploit him. Through the first forty-five minutes of the film, John only snorts, wheezes, and growls in his mask. An ominous air surrounds him. The physician's kindness, respect, and patience win John's trust. Then, we discover that John can not only speak, but--despite the crippling distortion of his mouth--he speaks elegant English. He quotes bible scriptures. He even writes poetry. John's only possession is a picture of his beautiful deceased mother. Elephants trampled her to death when she was only twenty-one.  In John's nightmares, one of those elephants--his father--impregnates his mother.<br /><br />A beautiful and sympathetic actress (Anne Bancroft) visits Merrick. Her open interest in John starts a new trend. Now, John plays the humble and frequent host to London's upper society. The hospital's head nurse, old Mrs. Mothershead--Wendy Hiller, dislikes John's growing fame. The old woman scolds Treves for making John a freak all over again. Treves is defensive--at least at the hospital, John's treated with some measure of human dignity and decency. John's not abused at the hospital as he is with Bytes, the carnival barker.<br /><br />The carnival suffers in John's absence; the Elephant Man was the freak show's most popular draw. Bytes interrupts John's new life, invades the hospital, and steals back his cash cow, the Elephant Man. Bytes treats John coldly, as one would treat an unfaithful spouse. The magic was gone. The Elephant Man has become a figure of sympathy. In a drunken fit of anger, Bytes drags John out of his trailer and tosses him into a cage full of baboons. The circus's other freaks pity John. They free him from the baboon cage and spirit him out of the circus.<br /><br />Traumatized, John hides his head--his face--under a sack and begins his long journey home: the hospital. He boards a train to London. At the train station, his hooded face, stooped back, and limping gait attracts a mob. They unmask him and flush him to the bowels of the station. They corner him in a restroom. Amid steampipes and rows of urinals and rusted toilets, John cries at the top of his lungs: \\"I am not an animal, I am not an animal!\\" The crowd dissipates, and the film moves to its final scene.<br /><br />The Elephant film is a poignant straightforward film directed by David Lynch, known for eccentric films like Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Wild at Heart, and Blue Velvet. Photographer Freddie Francis shot the film in black and white, a mode that evokes the era of the story and the mystique surrounding the film's subject. All of the main actors--Anne Bancroft, Anthony Hopkins, and Wendy Hiller--performed perfectly. But the biggest star of the Elephant Man was John Hurt. How he didn't win the Oscar in 1980, I'll never know. Get a box of Kleenex and see this film.<br /><br />author of [[ASIN:0759609942 Gotta Be Down!]]
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Top to bottom this is the standard that all comic book movie will be judged by. Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark. It is the perfect blend of comedy, and a movie that stays true to the comic. The special effects are great! Jeff Bridges does a great job as the villian and I must say that the bald head looks cool as hell on him. Even Pepper Potts is good. I am not a fan of Paltrow but she is great in this part!<br /><br />GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!
0960191038|3.0|I recently re-read this document cover-to-cover after a gap of 10 years.  It remains one of the best documents to learn how to effectively communicate in business writing:  1. It teachers you to keep the end customer (i.e., your business audience) in mind;  2. It highlights techniques and challenges in thinking that result in a well-received document;  3. It increases awareness of typical mistakes in communication, and provides excellent working examples of how they may be overcome, some of which may be directly borrowed for a typical business writing requirement.    On the flip side, this book is extremely challenging to read for a typical business user because:  1. It fails to summarize the document in the beginning - something that would provide the reader the 'structure' on how to learn from this book;  2. It takes way too much time even for a subject (good business writing) that naturally requires hard thinking and time;             2A. The book fails to take into account the reader's time commitment, and often the typical reader is better served attending a workshop on the same principles.  3. The writer has not used a good publisher or editor to improve readability resulting in the book becoming more a manual than a quick guide.  4. It is quite expensive.      Notice, I've tried to use some of Minto's techniqes to write this review.  Have I succeeded?  I rate my above writing as mildly above average - writing is hard work!    While studying this book, I decided to write notes on PowerPoint so that I could conduct a class for the people who report to me in my organization.  I also downloaded a bunch of similar presentations on the Minto priniciple off Google.  While reviewing my own notes taken chapter by chapter, it was amazing the number of times I had to move key points from one end of my presentation document to the other simply because the 'main message' on each chapter needed significant review.  In addition, its taken me about 40 hours over 2 months to'study', as this is not a book you 'skim' over.    For people serious about improving their writing, however, I do recommend going through the grind of this book to complement any workshop you might attend.  For those requiring a quick-fix, a shorter workshop that highlights 3 key concepts (1. S-C-Q-A  2. MECE  3. Typical logical structures) will be a sufficient start.    I look forward to a better revised edition, one that is more user-friendly, will appeal to a wider audience and hopefully reduce the cost of the book.  I have not read the third edition.      Super book, just not user-friendly.
1563890410|3.0|I have deep reservations for Seasons of Mists,     1) Gaiman appears here to advocate a monotheistic creator God who is above the polytheistic pantheons of `Gods(esses)', this can be taken as a propagandistic christian idea.  At the moment, having read the Sandman collection up to this point, this appears to be what Gaiman is saying.  What makes the christian pantheon of a creator, hell, heaven, angels and the Devil above any other?  The Sandman hands the angels the key because the creator has decided it is so.    2) The final sequence of the book scares me to death, that people will be taught the error of their ways, and will thank the angels in the end for this.  Is Gaiman really advocating exactly what happens in Orwell's 1984? that terror and torture can be used to mend someone's evil ways? That imposed torture and punishment can be a means of redemption?  Well for me if there happened to be a creator I'd be going to hell. My freedom can never be subjugated, I have no need of a creator who decides good and evil, an idea Plato had that Good and Evil exist behind actual actions.    In rejecting that subjugation, does not make me free to decide the goodness and evilness of my actions for I am a being that's existence is dependent on the existence of other beings.  Identity is not in any sense a Cartesian thinker, a homunculus, for I am other beings as well as myself, and importantly beings who I can never know and must respect for that, and realise the finiteness of human understanding.    Gaiman seems to hold at this moment many views that are the exact opposite of freedom.
0143113100|5.0|Dr Doigdge does an amazing job of teaching difficult scientific concepts in a manner that made me want to keep reading because I was understanding it. Who would have thought that a nonfiction book about brain plasticity would become a page turner? I hope he writes another book about the brain.

B0016NF06O|5.0|What a great album - my husband and I so enjoy this one! We have never particularly been Willie Nelson fans, but heard a song played from this on XM and couldn't wait to get the whole album. It's fun music - and we are both becoming Nelson fans. Of course, what can you say about Wynton - he's good at anything he does. Highly recommend this one!
B000BT97AO|3.0|There are few comic book writers in the world that are more respected than master storyteller Neil Gaiman, whose combination of whimsical fantasy, dark satire, and comedic absurdism brought him to the forefront of the \\"British invasion\\" of comic books in the 1980s. Gaiman's collaborations with celebrated artist/writer, Dave McKean have resulted in some truly unique works, but perhaps their most ambitious collaborative effort is the hallucinatory fantasy film MirrorMask. MirrorMask was produced by The Jim Henson Company, who were responsible for some of the greatest fantasy films made in the `80s. Unlike those previous films, which were populated by quirky characters that were brought to life by puppets, MirrorMask was created using CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery). This heavy use of computer effects feels overwhelming much of the time and undermines the emotional impact of the film.    Helena, a teenaged girl, lives with her mother and father as part of a traveling circus. But Helena long for a normal life outside of juggling, people in costumes and makeup, and the pressures of performing in front of crowds of spectators. After an intense confrontation with her mother, Helena is shocked to discover that her mother has cancer and will need an emergency operation. Conflicted and full of guilt and regret, Helena falls into a troubled sleep where she is transported into a surrealistic nightmare world. In this nightmare world, Helena is mistaken for the daughter of the unforgiving Dark Queen, whose daughter is identical in appearance to Helena. The nightmare world is fragmented and unstable, and in order to restore balance Helena must find the magic MirrorMask and return to her own world where the Dark Queen's daughter has assumed her identity. Helena is aided, and at times hindered, by a host of otherworldly characters and creatures such as stone giants, sphinxes, a griffin, and monkeybirds. She also finds a companion in the roguish jester, Valentine. But can Helena save the dream world and return to her own? And will her mother be all right when she gets home?    While the film is stunningly original in its vision, the plot is typical of the fantasy genre, and is strongly reminiscent of both [[ASIN:0543900568 Through the Looking Glass]] and [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz]]. The visual style may remind some people of surrealist artists like Salvador Dali and expressionists like Edvard Munch, but for the most part the film looks like nothing you'll have ever seen before.  Although I greatly admire the filmmakers for their creative audacity, I must admit that I was disappointed with the execution of the story. I think this can be attributed to the fact that director David McKean had only ever directed short films and music videos, which left him ill prepared to tell a complex story on film. The narrative, which feels rushed, will probably be incomprehensible to younger viewers, who will probably be too freaked out by the weird atmosphere to care.  All in all, MirrorMask feels like an experiment that didn't go as planned. It's neither a masterpiece nor a disaster, but rather the first cinematic effort of a director who shows real potential. I hope if and when David McKean makes another film, that he will take more time to develop an emotional investment in characters, and that he'll be given a larger budget, and a better editor.

0316067601|5.0|This is a great story about a SEAL team against huge odds. I'm horrified that anyone gave it less than a five star. I recommend this for anyone interested in the military stuff or just wants a great book to read. This book is great! Also try loaning it to friends if you think they will like it (trust me they will love it).
0312427999|5.0|This book is an essential read considering the current economic situation. The vast majority of people including me have no idea of the details of how harmful some economic policies been.  This book brings many of those details to light in a way that is both understandable and enthralling.  The direct role that the American government and University of Chicago economists have played in both Chile and Russia's disastrous attempts at capitalism are shocking.  In fact there are so many things that are shocking, I am somewhat surprised that the book was allowed to be published.  (If more Americans read books, it probably would not have been.)  Probably the most shocking to me was learning of Dr. Jeffery Sach's[[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time]] role in Russia during its rule by Yeltsin.  It seems that he has dramatically altered his views on what is a good economic system for a society to thrive.    Disaster Capitalism has been experienced around the world.  How much longer will it be before the US gets our shock?  If people read this book, hopefully they will be informed and motivated to insist that we have a sound economic system in place.

0743298020|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a teacher who used it for a book club discussion.  I had never heard of it but got it from the library.  It was wonderful, involving, and entertaining.  You became invested in the characters, and I feel it would make a wonderful movie as well.  I now have purchased it for a Christmas gift, I know my recipient will be pleased.

B0011HF6GE|1.0|I have to agree with the guy, and his wife, who said this album had an annoying sound.  I bought the album off of the strength of the other reviews, since I've had good luck with that practice in the past.  I regret this purchase, though.  I wasn't able to understand Bon Iver's lyrics because of the way he shuffled the words together.  It sounded like some weird combination of mumbling and whining.

B0000033TE|4.0|\\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" has been my first taste of ELP, and I think it's fairly good. It does great things for the imagination, and there's a fair bit of variety in the moods of the tracks.    The album opens with a cover of the hymn \\"Jerusalem\\", whose sweeping mix of organ, drums and synthesizers really do the song justice. The instrumental \\"Tocatta\\" follows, a track full of energy, paranoia and menace. \\"Still You Turn Me On\\", which is more quiet and reflective, is quite a contrast. The rough-around-the-edges vocals matched with the squidgy synthesizer in the following track, \\"Benny the Bouncer\\", didn't really do it for me, but there's an interesting enough story in the lyrics. Then comes \\"Karn Evil 9\\", an epic track (divided into 4 tracks on this edition) with lyrics by Peter Sinfeld that cover everything from a futuristic circus to a rogue computer. Out of the three impressions, I enjoy the first the most, which rocks along quite thoroughly.    This particular edition contains a ninth track, \\"The Making of Brain Salad Surgery\\", which features interview snippets with Emerson, Lake and Palmer, linked together with narration. Topics covered include how the album was recorded and controversies surrounding the cover. Speaking of the cover, my edition of the album (the 1996 one) features artwork with a special casing which makes the front cover change when you move it about, revealing the woman behind.
0060751967|5.0|This book is absolutely outstanding in its genre. I didn't expect it at all. If you think once you have read vampire romance you know them all - this will be a nice refreshing twist for you. The story is very well developed, the characters are believable and the dialogue a hoot, yet the romance is very real. And let me tell you - vamire sex the way it is in this book -  yummy. The heroine is very believable, strong, not a whiner and even though the hero is the dark, sexy, powerful vampire - he is different than the usual hero.<br />Anyway, if you like the Sookie Stackhouse novels, you will like this one even more. It is not as dark as the Dark Hunters or Carpathians.<br />I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it.
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Trivium is back to what made me like them in the first place.  This is a step in the right direction.  Yes there still is that Hetfield voice but I can deal with it now that his real clean voices and the RETURN of the screaming and growling are present.  Musically this is a sound album.  The Crusade on the other hand was a slap in the face to their fans in my opinion.  Oh how I dislike that album.  Metalcore fans will rejoice with the return of the REAL Trivium.
B00003CXMG|5.0|\\" Almost Famous\\" is at the top of my 'Top Ten Favorites' list. Patrick Fugit is so amazingly talented, and it just blew me away that it was his first movie. No other actor could've played the part of William Miller better than him.   My favorite parts of the movie are when he runs to The Plaza Hotel to comfort a drug-overdosed Penny Lane, he tells Penny he loves her, and when Russell Hammond apologizes to William about Rolling Stone.   I love how it has a sweet ending of William and Russell parting on good terms, and William's story finally being published in Rolling Stone.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|After the debacle and critical failure of \\"St. Anger\\" I was hesitant to buy this. But I decided to give them another chance and I'm sure glad I did.    In my opinion, this is the best album they've ever done. I can't believe how good this record is. Unbelievable.       Buy it now!!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|First off, have you ever heard \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes?\\" Because that is a song and a half, my good friend. It's the best song the group ever made in any of their various combinations, and that's really saying something, since I love a lot of CSNY songs. But this is head-and-shoulders above even the best of their most amazing songs, which is saying quite a lot. As the title implies, it's a four-part suite, and an absolutely fantastic one at that. The first part is energetic and terrifically catchy. Then you've got my favorite, the slow second part. The group works up a deep, dreamy groove and harmonizes on the \\"What have I got to lose?\\" sections perfectly, and Stills does this awesome trick with double-tracking and echo - you get a \\"hey\\" in one channel, another \\"hey\\" shortly afterwards in the opposite channel, and a third \\"hey\\" immediately after that back in the first. And, right after that, he delivers the best vocal performance in his entire career, totally taking the spotlight by adopting a full-on soul man voice. That part is awesome... \\"Can I TELL IT LIKE IT IS? Listen to me, baby... it's my HEAAAAAAAAAAART that's dying and that's what I've got to lose!\\" Especially the way he sings \\"heart,\\" extending it to like eleven syllables, in a kick-butt falsetto. And he makes it look easy. Steve Stills is a really good singer.<br /><br />Anyway, the third part sounds like something you'd hear at the Renaissance Festival, and I like it! That section is just about the most poetic love song not written by Smokey Robinson that I've ever heard. And after that, you have the fun, bouncy, half-Latin \\"do do do do doot, doot doot do do do doot\\" part, which rules. I love Stills' random Spanish scatting! And despite being a suite, the song never gets pretentious. It's mostly acoustic, it doesn't have any random soloing, and it's a great sing-along tune.<br /><br />Stills wrote it, and of course, he's the star of this record: he not only wrote or co-wrote half the tunes, but he also plays guitar, bass, and organ when necessary. He's also one of the three lead singers, but you knew that. But Graham Nash and David Crosby come up with some winners, too! Crosby's eerie \\"Guinevere\\" is an example - the three-part harmony choruses are beautiful, and the way Stills and Nash support Crosby during the verses is awesome. That and I love Crosby's voice. Actually, I love all three of these guy's voices. Dave also co-wrote, along with Stills and Paul Katner of the Jefferson Airplane, the haunting, dramatic anti-war epic \\"Wooden Ships,\\" with moody organ, heavy guitars, vocal trade-offs between Crosby and Stills, and an excellently harmonized chorus, it's my favorite song here other than the suite. And Crosby's angry hippie rocker \\"Long Time Gone\\" is a first-rate piece as well, once again because of those harmonies! And Crosby's lead vocals!<br /><br />Graham Nash also adds the solid psychedelic pop song \\"Marrakesh Express,\\" and the decent acoustic ballad \\"Lady of the Island.\\" Neither of the two is as good as Nash's two songs from D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, but I love \\"Marrakesh!\\" It's so cute! And, I mean, try not singing along with it! \\"Lady of the Island...\\" I could take or leave it. But those vocal harmonies Crosby adds near the end sure are pretty. Same deal with \\"Pre-Road Downs,\\" an okay but unspectacular country-rocker.<br /><br />But yeah, back to my point about how Steve Stills wrote most of these songs. He's given the sole credit to \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\\" \\"You Don't Have to Cry,\\" \\"Pre-Road Downs,\\" \\"Helplessly Hoping,\\" and \\"49 Bye-Byes,\\" and I can safely say I like all of those songs but \\"Pre-Road Downs\\" a lot. I already talked about \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" (by the way, isn't it a bit disappointing when a band's best song ever is also the first song on their first album?) and \\"Pre-Road Downs\\" (meh), and I can safely say I love the other four. \\"You Don't Have to Cry\\" is arguably the catchiest song, which is saying a lot. It's so hard not to sing along to!And it's so much fun!<br /><br />By contrast, \\"Helplessly Hoping\\" is probably Stills' attempt to pull a \\"Guinevere\\" of his own - it's got the same repeating, Medieval acoustic guitar figure, the same hypnotic feel, the same excellent harmonies, and the same semi-poetic lyrics. And he actually almost outdoes it, especially in that part when Stills sings \\"they are one person,\\" Nash adds \\"they are two alone,\\" and Crosby adds \\"they are three together.\\" I think Stills wrote the lyrics as an exercise in alliteration, too: the first five words are \\"helplessly hoping, her harlequin hovers...,\\" a later lyric goes \\"heartlessly helping himself,\\" and there's a reference to a \\"Lady who lingers.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I used to not like \\"49 Bye-Byes,\\" but you know what caught me about it? Two things: the harmonies in the chorus (not like that was obvious or anything), and the tempo shift between the verse and chorus. Tempo shifts are cool! And, of course, the singing on both this and the entire record is some of the most imaginative I've ever heard. These three could harmonize like nobody else. In terms of those harmonies, this is definitely the best Crosby, Stills, Nash, and maybe Young record in history, and in terms of songs, it probably wins out too. \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes,\\" man... \\"Wooden Ships,\\" too... and hey, who can forget \\"Marrakesh Express\\" in terms of sheer goofy fun? For the record, \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Marrakesh Express\\" were big hits, and this is a great debut!\\"Helplessly Hoping\\" is probably Stills' attempt to pull a \\"Guinevere\\" of his own - it's got the same repeating, Medieval acoustic guitar figure, the same hypnotic feel, the same excellent harmonies, and the same semi-poetic lyrics.

0061565407|5.0|I have read a number of books on tape and this was the first on CD. It is without question the best and most entertaining book on tape or CD to which I have ever listened.In fact, I have enjoyed it so much that I have now listened to it three times since purchasing it. I have told many people about it, have loaned them my set of CDs, and encouraged others to purchase it (which they have done). As a journalist and public relations practitioner who does a lot of writing, I have a great appreciation for extraordinary writing. This is an exceptional work by Garth Stein and I knew that even before I finished the first CD. He and the narrator do such a wonderful job that you nearly feel like Enzo and Denny are your friends. Was not aware of Garth Stein previously, but will be looking to read or listen to more of his work in the future.  Mike Shaw
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|\\"Jumper\\" was a film that I enjoyed so much that I went back to see it in the theatre a second time.  I'm so glad that I have the great DVD.  Doug Liman had directed another favorite of mine, [[ASIN:B000AP04FG Mr. & Mrs. Smith (Widescreen Edition)]].  In adapting Steven Gould's novel, the current executive producer of TV's new \\"Knight Rider\\" series planned for a three-part picture franchise.  Hayden Christensen who came to prominence as Anakin Skywalker in Episodes II & III of \\"Star Wars\\" and earned a Golden Globe Best Supporting Actor nomination for 2001's \\"Life as a House\\" plays David Rice, a young man who can teleport instantly.  We learn a back history of war between the jumpers and those out to destroy them, the Paladins.  Samuel L. Jackson who was great in [[ASIN:B00008EYA5 S.W.A.T. (Widescreen Special Edition)]] and got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for \\"Pulp Fiction\\" plays the white-haired Roland who hunts David.  David's high school heartthrob is Millie played by TV's \\"O.C.\\" Rachel Bilson who was also excellent in [[ASIN:B000JLTRK4 The Last Kiss (Widescreen Edition)]].  David runs into another jumper played by Jamie Bell who won the British Best Actor Academy Award for \\"Billy Elliott\\" and also appeared in Clint Eastwood's \\"Flags of Our Fathers.\\"  Diane Lane has what is essentially a cameo that would be sure to grow if there is a second film.  She plays David's mother Mary who is a Paladin.  She loves her son, but also has vowed to kill him.  Michael Rooker has a great cameo as the alcoholic father William Rice.  Oscar nominee Tom Hulce from 1984's \\"Amadeus\\" plays Mr. Bowlker.  I really enjoyed this non-stop action flick and loved the great effects from the British double-decker bus that suddenly bursts into the desert to the great fight scene that lands Griffin & David in Iraq.  This is an excellent film that promises to become a great film series.  Enjoy!
B001CIPU3G|5.0|Ascendancy, and The Crusade were good, well-written albums in my opinion.  Matt Heafy has the kind talent that either makes you hate him, or fills you with the desire to get better.  The previous two albums culminate on Shogun.  Shogun sounds like neither of their previous albums but rather fuses them along with some new sounds.  If you like metal even slightly you will appreciate Shogun and the musicianship Trivium brings to the table!
031606792X|5.0|This book was absolutely the best, by far, that I have read in a long time.  All four in this series is a five star!!!  It takes you away from reality for a little while, which makes it all the better!!  I am the mother of a 14 year old daughter and wanted to know what all the rage was about in these books, now I know!!  These books are intoxicating!!  You absolutely fall in love with these characters!!  I also applaud the author for some of the morals used in these books, for instance marriage before sex.  I have read some of the negative reviews that were posted and a lot of them said that this book is not good because all ends well.  I personally think it ended great, there is so much heart break in the real world let us read something that has a happy ending for a change!  Stephenie Meyer is a very talented author!!!  Wonderful read!!!
1590200918|5.0|I was intrigued by the premise of the story.  When I started the book, I knew it was one of those books you just can't put down, nor do you want to.  It is similar to a modern Poe story and I hope you agree, one that you would want to recommend to friends and read again!

B000000OAL|3.0|The debut album from Queen contains a few of the elements that would eventually define the band, but is very much a generic early 70's Prog-rock/metal album. The pomp and grandiosity that would become Queen hallmarks are largely absent, however Freddy Mercury's distinct voice and Brian May's original guitar tones are in evidence throughout. The legendary excess and theatrical flair is a mere tease at this stage, with Queen's vocabulary still in a formative period.<br /><br />The key tracks are the ones usually plucked for the many Queen anthologies, \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\" and \\"Liar.\\" The Kings and medieval themes prevalent in the era are available on \\"Great King Rat\\" and a tease of [[ASIN:B000000OBJ Queen II]] is offered when the album closes with \\"Seven Seas of Rhye.\\" For the most part, the show is May and Mercury's, with a quick peek at Roger Taylor's vocals on the otherwise forgettable \\"Modern Times Rock and Roll.\\" The band has not quite gelled and the Queen everyone knows and loves emerged in full on the second album then really detonated on [[ASIN:B000000OAA Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[ASIN:B000000OAN A Night at the Opera]] (both superior albums).
B000MG1YC0|5.0|\\"Nine Destinies and a Downfall\\" is the third full-length album by Sirenia, the gothic metal band founded by Morten Veland in 2001 after his stint with Tristiana.  It differs substantially from their earlier work, featuring female-fronted vocals almost exclusively.  This is in sharp contrast to the male death grunts that dominated Sirenia's first two albums.<br /><br />Because of this stylistic difference, \\"Nine Destinies and a Downfall\\" didn't appeal to many fans of Sirenia's previous work.  However, fans of other female-fronted metal bands (such as Within Temptation, Lacuna Coil, Eyes of Eden, and Nightwish) enjoyed the album quite a bit.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, \\"Nine Destinies and a Downfall\\" is very solid, featuring a blistering (yet melodic) gothic metal mix anchored by top-notch guitar work.  Monika Pedersen's voice is strong and fits in beautifully.  The lyrics are dark and gloomy, as befits a gothic metal album.  The top tracks on this album include the following:<br /><br />The Last Call - 5 stars<br />One by One - 4 stars<br />Absent Without Leave - 4 stars<br />The Other Side - 5 stars<br />Seven Keys and Nine Doors - 5 stars<br /><br />Highly recommended to the fan of female-fronted metal.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|This movie is terrible!! I give this a one star because of the special effects but otherwise this movie sucks. I am more confused than ever after I watched this movie. As with other movies I had hoped they would give histories of the jumpers like how they came about and so forth and the people who kill jumpers and how they came about and so forth. This movie is a tag your it and catch me if you can.
1594489505|5.0|I first listened to CD's of this book on a very long and boring car trip. Of course I had already read and immensely enjoyed The Kite Runner. Well, this is even better, although somewhat more harrowing. It shares the same elegance of writing style, surprising, when one considers that English is not Hosseini's first language. The local color of Afghanistan is fascinating, but more interesting yet is the detail of injustices to women that is so unlike that which exists in Western society. Even though the book is, I presume, fiction, there is nothing self-serving or deliberately sensational about it. To say it is merely a good read is to do it a dis-service. Marvellous!
B00154GEFU|5.0|The 1982 release of \\"ASIA\\" was the first cassette album I purchased for my walkman (remember those?) back in the beginning throws of my teenager years.  It opened a personal path for me to hear music that would become mine.  'Mine' in the sense that it wasn't the music my parents had me listen to, nor music others were into that I did not enjoy.  The music of Asia provided me much needed solitude while riding my bicycle around the city bike paths and gave me a sense of freedom and escape from the stresses of youth.  I connected with the music very quickly and found myself almost always selecting Asia as the band of listening choice when going on my rides.    Music is a very personal thing.  I never find it worth while to spend time writing how I hate a band or their music.  This being the first and only review I have written should lend some idea as to just how much I have enjoyed the music from the original Asia lineup.  I not only loved Asia's debut album, but the \\"ALPHA\\" album continued to fill my craving for music I could connect with.  Even to this day, these albums transfer me to a time gone by and allow me to reflect on my youthful past.  It wasn't just the lyrics I liked, but the MUSIC.    I was excited to learn of the band's reunion and trip to the recording studio.  These four musicians bring together talents that are becoming more rare in the music field.  While \\"PHOENIX\\" brings elements of their trademark sounds from the early 80's, the maturity of each contributor is evident on this record.  John's voice is in absolute top form.  Steve, Geoff, and Carl give proper attention to the instrumental work.  If you carefully listen each time you play the album, like the \\"ASIA\\" and \\"ALPHA\\" albums, you will notice and, hopefully, appreciate the intricate layers of sound, vocal harmonizing, and wonderful musicianship that went into the making of \\"PHOENIX\\".  The songs have become imbedded in my head and I have a hard time listening to anything else since purchasingthe album.    I highly recommend this album to any fan of the original ASIA.  Listen to it.  Not just once, but OVER and OVER.  Hear the beautiful music that works so well together.  Each song has qualities of a gem within them and all of the songs flow well on the album.    My hat goes off to John, Geoff, Steve, and Carl for the EXTRAORDINARY work put into this album.  I hope you will continue to work together in the future and provide more wonderful, quality music for us.
1594489505|5.0|I enjoyed the book. Despite having a mostly sad story line, the two female main characters demonstrated courage, love, and hope in an otherwise brutal and oppressive marriage.  This book is not for children since it frequently describes sexual encounters in a somewhat graphic, though tasteful, manner.    No need to recount the story since other reviewers have already done that.  I'll just express some thoughts that occurred to me as I read the book:    1) The book describes at least two lines of Islamic thought.  One is the oppressive, brutal Taliban variety that treats women harshly, prohibits them from study or work, and views them as male property.  The other is a more open minded, progressive variety that encourages women to learn and work.  The author clearly prefers the progressive variety.  The story shows the danger of having zealots in control of a country.  We're truly fortunate to be in a country where one ideology or religion does not control us, particularly an oppressive ideology like the Talibans.      2) The story has two women who grew up without having to wear burqas, marrying a man of the repressive variety who required them to wear a burqa in public.  Having lived in Afghanistan for several months, this brought back memories of the women wearing burqas, how uncomfortable they seemed, and the double standard.  It reminded me of a time at a lake near San Antonio where I saw three Muslim women sitting on the beach in direct summer sun (very hot) wearing black abayas, waiting and watching while their husbands wearing swim shorts and no shirt played in the water with the kids. It escapes me how some Muslim men don't see how cruel and unfair this double standard is. They claim the cover is for purity, yet if that were true the males would have to cover themselves as well to maintain their purity.  Yet, nowhere do we see male burqas or abayas.    3) Most of the story line was about a brutal wife beater.  For the wife abusers, the burqa is a great way toconceal bruises.    4) Women under the Taliban had no rights and that is true in many middle eastern cultures still.  I'm glad our western cultures got past the \\"women as chattel\\" concept.  We can only hope the Afghan culture and the rest of the middle east will wake up and stop oppressing half their populations.    5) The Taliban sense of justice is truly warped.  In the story, a husband beats a woman, another woman tries to stop him from doing that and ends up killing him to protect both their lives....so the Taliban sentence HER to death because women have no right to disobey their husbands.  Scary. Although this story is fiction, it is based on reality.       6) The book reminded me of a Japanese-made film about the life of a woman and her daughter struggling to live under the Taliban.  Saw it in Kabul but can't remember the name.  Very powerful and depressing movie.  It brings the evilness of the Taliban into crystal clear focus, as does this book.      7) The father of one of the women had ostracised her because she was a \\"harami\\" (bastard child of his).  He refused to acknowledge her and instead married her off to a brutal man far away.  At the end, he attempts to gain forgiveness, but it's too late.  Made me think of the importance of caring for our children and ensuring they know we love them.    8) The tension that exists in Afghan culture between arranged marriages and marriages desired by both parties is shown.  Another example of how the culture is behind the times and inconsiderate of the feelings of people wanting marriage.  Too often, the reality there is that a young woman is married off to an old guy that she finds repulsive and, well, old...and often she knows a young man she finds attractive, yet is unable to marry.      9) The ending was powerful with Laila going to the birthplace of her deceased co-wife to honor her and feel connection to the woman.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I absolutely loved this film.  I must admit i did not expect much going into it.  I have never been a huge Will Smith fan or a fan of science fiction which this film seemed to be.  Wow, was I shocked and amazed with the excellent, quality film of the highest caliber that totally took me by surprise.<br /><br />This film is so well made.  I thought the story was very well laid out.  The government thought that they had finally found a cure for cancer by using a vaccine for another illness.  After much use the treatment backfired with major side effects with the people turning into flesh eating zombies who could never be in the sun.  I didn't look at the creatures as mere vampire like beings but thought the deterioration due to the vaccine was well documented.  Back to the plot, New York City becomes quaurantined and Will Smith plays Neville, a military scientist who stays in New York to work on finding a cure.<br /><br />The barren and stranded New York City is amazing to view.  I was caught up in the film from the first second and amazed as I watched the small world Neville had created for himself and his dog which allowed him to work on the cure but also have protection from the creatures.  He ventured out every day and returned at night.  Will Smith has been praised for other films but his work here was truly Oscar worthy.  The first half of the film is the best when it is just him and the dog.  His characterization is more than believable as the lone survivor who deals with loneliness by talking to mannequins etc.  He has not gone crazy but has adapted.  I found the story to also be believable and the creatures when shown were also believable and very well created.  The movie has a serious basis but also has chills and thrills like one of the best horror films there are.<br /><br />In the latter half of the film the plot changes a little (I won't give it away) and the 5 star plus caliber of the first half gets a little off track.  It is still excellent but the first half was so superior it is hard to compete with.  The film has a purpose and shows Will Smith as never seen before.  Whatever your expectations for this film, upon viewing they will be far surpassed.  Excellent acting, amazing production and directing.<br /><br />Highly recommended.it is hard to compete with.

B001C08RHA|5.0|I'm a Batman girl myself, but if they continue to make Iron Man films as good as this one then I'll become a fan.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. does a really good job in this film. His ability to make the one liners snap really works, and I was laughing at plenty of them. He was also really convincing as a genuis billionare weapons manufacturer. He almost made it look like a really cool and fun job.<br /><br />But of course it's not. He's kidnapped and forced to build, and use, his own weapon against himself and his country. But instead of doing that he invents a suit that turns out to be an awesome piece of technology.<br /><br />The special effects are really cool in this movie. They don't really look CGI or anything at all. They feel pretty real even though you know none of it is likely to be possible in say next year.<br /><br />The movie flows along at a pretty good pace. It's rather short, but you don't notice it until the movie is done. I really like that it seems longer, but isn't.<br /><br />The entire cast I felt was really good in this. The action was perfect, the imaginative weapons and gadgets on the suit were hot. The robots were even a life to themselves.<br /><br />Super cool movie.
031606792X|4.0|I'll be the first to admit that I don't find the quality of the writing in the Twilight series very good, but Stephenie Meyer herself has said that she was never trying to be a great writer, she was trying to be a good storyteller.   I found that Breaking Dawn was a fairly good ending for the series-it's supposed to be like a fairy tale, and, after all, don't they always have happy endings?   In my opinion, mostly all of the answers to questions readers would have are answered...the ending suits the series, and it seems like what is meant to be actually happens. The main theme of the series was obviously love--all kinds of love--and I think the final book pulls that theme together nicely.   -SPOILER ALERT-   There have been reviews where people state that Bella got everything she wanted...well, so what? It's not like she didn't have to fight for it. She made a limitless amount of sacrifices throughout the first three books, and in the last, she certainly made possibly the greatest sacrifice. She loved her baby, and she suffered through several months of her practically letting it destroy her from the inside in order to allow it live, because SHE wanted it (is her sacrifice not a sign of maturity?). The pain that she puts herself, and Edward, through with her pregnancy just goes to show that Edward is NOT the only thing in her life. She's not just so hopelessly obsessed with him to the point that she'll do whatever he wants--she won't give up her baby, even though he, and practically everyone else, wants her to do so. If ANYTHING, I would say that it's a sign of empowerment on her part. It's about the power of CHOICE. It's a sign that, ultimately, she does have an independent side--that she is her own person. And, if you really read about all of the physical pain that she has to go through (her spine breaks for goodness sakes), I doubt that young readers would find that appealing in regards to becoming pregnant. It's not a happy, gushy, cute, endearing pregnancy--quite the opposite. It's ugly and painful (emotionally and physically)--what young reader will read that and go, \\"I wish that were me.\\"   As far as Jacob imprinting on Renessmee goes, I was a little put-off at first, but, I'm okay with it in the end. It states very clearly in New Moon and in other parts of the novels that imprinting isn't all romantic. Jacob will be for Renessmee whatever he ends her to be--a caretaker, a friend, a brother, and, maybe at some point her romantic partner...but until that exact day comes, he won't see or imagine himself as anything more. It feels like this was something that was meant to be--Jacob, forever a protector of Bella/her family in one way or another. I feel like, based on the characters, that this is the only way Jacob could have come to terms with Bella's change, with her choice.   If ANYTHING, I would say that the message of the Twilight series is about true love involving sacrifice. It's about fighting for love, fighting for what you want, for what you believe is meant to be. It's about how true love never comes easy, about how love involves sacrifice, it involves hate, anger, pain...it involves everything, but it can ultimately be a wonderful thing, even though it always involves work. The fact that Bella doesn't go to college right away doesn't mean all that much--She has eternity, and I wouldn't be surprised if her character, with Edward at her side, go through Harvard or Dartmouth eventually.   In almost every negative review I read, people argue that bad points of the book are that Bella gets everything that she wants, but that she's also too dependent on Edward--that she isn't her own person. Well, you can't have it both ways. Her life just can't revolve COMPLETELY around Edward and at the same time have her get COMPLETELY what she wants--or else you would have to say that EDWARD gets whatever he wants because she's just too dependent and obsessed with him to do anything besides what he desires. And that is obviously not the case--Edward didn't want her to continue the pregnancy, and he didn't want her to become a vampire...but both happen DESPITE his desires, because it's what Bella wants. Seems to me that, while Bella loves Edward as much as she could possibly love someone, she's still her own person, making her own decisions. The message isn't that love, or other people, define you; it's that the choices you make within love and within your relationships with others and your life define you. It's YOUR choices that make up who you are, and that YOU have to live with the consequences of those choices. If that isn't a good message for young readers, I don't know what is.
0375703861|1.0|I agree with other reviewers who mention Smith's lack of focus in writing the story and lack of compassion for the characters.  It reads like the work of a twenty-something with limited life experience who is overly proud of herself and just can't be bothered to get anything right.  Flip judgments of characters don't make for an entertaining or compelling read. This is one to avoid, despite the opinions of reviewers obsessed with the writer's youth and good looks.  It's a look, not a book.
B0011Z76RS|4.0|nowadays linkin park is trying too hard to \\"break the mold\\" but with their debut album, they already had. With their combination of rap beats and great metal riffs it creates a \\"get up and fight\\" feeling that is lost on most other bands with their relentless whining. the lyrics are pretty great too. Compared to Meteora, It's a toss up, but I believe this is their best album, it has everything any metal-head could ask for. also, it's great for playing any game to, perfect for any fight.

But no, we wait all this time to FINALLY have the 'original, true' versions of the first 3 Star Wars films on DVD, and it's not even the best transfer they could (easily) provide us.    Lucas should be slapped with a thick wad of his own money.
006074815X|5.0|Ken Follet wrote this book and came out of the gates as the leader contender in the World War II Thriller category. Eventually, it was made into a pretty good movie with Donald Sutherland. Why did I think it was such a good book?<br /><br />(1) He established that Hitler is weighing the need for information on the Allies intentions on the Western front. If Hitler can predict - and foil - the Allies invasion so the theory goes, then he can throw his Western divisions against the Communist onslaught in the East.<br /><br />(2) Intimate Plotting - the plot revolves around the German spy (codename: \\"Needle\\" or Die Nadel), a woman and the investigator. By bringing into a real, intimate forum, the character jump off the page . He uses a neat triangulation of destiny to finally fulfill the suspense and premise of the book.<br /><br />(3) The \\"What If\\" - Suspense at its best, particularly when the stakes are the greatest invasion in HIstory.<br /><br />(4) Excellent complication - Die Nadel is a particularly adept spy. He doesn't even trust his fellow German spies for fear that they have been compromised (which was true in England's case of subverting all the German spies during this period).<br /><br />The book is an essential read for the thriller and World War II genre.

0451203933|5.0|Bowden has written a masterful account of the Black Hawk Down tragedy which became a famous Tony Scott movie. The scene is grim: Mogadishu under the warlords with an inept, incompetent United Nations force presuming that it will separate the warring factions and restore peace. The United States commits its troops to snatch a warlord and his cronies to cripple the terrorists gripping this impoverished nation and its capital. Political consideration such as the prohibition of armor takes precedence over protecting the troops. The October 1993 incident raises a lot of questions about elite units, vicious house to house fighting, the support that is possible or necessary to engage such terrorist forces, etc., In addition, there were reports that Osama bin Laden had urged (or some say even sent his underlings) to attack the American troops. The subsequent withdrawal of the troops by Clinton had some analysts saying that this act emboldened bin Laden in subsequent years. With powerful descriptions about the elite fighting units predicament under a mission gone awry, this book will at least acquaint the reader with horrible consequences of modern warfare.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I don't have Showtime, but saw Michael C. Hall in [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under]] and loved him!! So I bought [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter - The First Season]] and loved it too!!<br /><br />I saw [[ASIN:B000V86OKG The Second Season]] and was blown away by the direction they went in! I haven't seen the 3rd season yet, but will snag that when it comes available. I sure hope the cover changes, though. This odd-colored, Andy Warhol style just doesn't work for Dex. And the tagline \\"Power-Saw To The People\\" is outright corny. I hope it has tons of extra goodies unlike the first 2 season. Showtime has really screwed Dexter fans with the extra material on their DVDs! You get more extra stuff by visiting their site than on the DVD, which doesn't make sense! Can't wait until next season, too!! Kill 'em all, Dexter!!
0345298349|4.0|Arkady Renko is introduced in this book as a Moscow investigator. There is a bizarre triple murder in Moscow. Three bodies are found, frozen, with their faces and fingers gone. Renko is the chief homicide investigator. He's brilliant, indefatigible, honest and, as cops everywhere are, cynical. He is heading through dangerous territory in his investigation, confronting the KGB, FBI and other authorities to find the truth.
B000Z8GZYW|4.0|Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a self-absorbed weatherman in Pittsburg who is obsessed with moving to a larger market.  As part of his job, he goes every year to Pitsatony to cover the groundhog festivities on February 2nd.  This year, he is going with his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and camera guy Larry (Chris Elliot).  He can't wait to get home, but a blinding snowstorm makes it impossible for them to leave.<br /><br />The next morning, Phil wakes up to discover that it isn't the next morning.  And no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up to find it is February 2nd.  Slowly, he begins to learn from his mistakes and do thing differently.  But will he ever get out of this repetitive repetition?<br /><br />After hearing this movie praised for years, I finally got a chance to see it.  And I enjoyed it.  There are lots of very funny moments as Phil deals with his predicament.  His reactions near the beginning are priceless.  And there is a very heartwarming message underneath it all.<br /><br />However, I did find it got old before the movie was over.  And there are some very dark scenes that felt out of place for the comedy it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Those are minor issues, however.  So if you've missed this movie, get it today and enjoy it over and over and over and over again.
0307269752|5.0|I survived jury duty because of this book!  It is a wonderful murder mystery that pulls you in from the first chapter.  The characters are extreemly interesting and you find yourself very easily involved with the story.  I couldn't put it down!  After jury duty I went home and read more, that night I stayed up until 2 AM because I couldn't put it down, the next 2 nights I did the same thing!  That doesn't happen to me often.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the plot away, so I will say this:<br />- The plot in very engaging<br />- The characters are wonderfully fleshed-out<br />- The layers are complex without being confusing<br />- It has its dark moments, but doesn't over do it<br />- The twists in the book are VERY unexpected and greatly entertaining<br />- The big reveal makes you say \\"NO WAY!\\" out loud, much to the dismay of your sleeping husband<br />- The end is the only way the story could have closed<br /><br />I highly recommend this book -- just make sure you start it on a Friday, not a Tuesday, or it will ruin your work week :)

B00192KCQ0|1.0|I tried really hard to like this album. I listened to it three times before I put it away for good. The 12 guage did its job.  Poor mix quality, this sounds like a demo or pirate copy. They should sue themselves.  Musically, it sounds like they literally \\"phoned it in\\". I won't bother with specific reviews of tracks, as others have done, but even if it didn't sound so bad, I couldn't get into any of the songs. The whole album drips mediocrity. Hetfield's voice is SMOOTH, like he's not trying. The guitar work is derivative, and the new bassist sounds out of place. Funky Metal?  This is it. Where do I go to get my money back?

B000002I6T|5.0|Being a Byrds fan as well as a CSNY fan I love this CD. I never owned it on record and I don't really know why. I guess I didn't really get into any of the solo work of Crosby or Nash although I did the Stills and Young stuff. I picked this one up a few months ago and I simply loved it. It is so good to hear the harmonies that at times take you directly back to the Byrds era of Younger Than Yesterday which was the pinicle of the sixties as far as I am concerned. A couple of tracks could be called \\"dated\\" such as Cowboy Movie which is a tune that could easily have been on Deja Vu - same guitar riffs and vocals. However if only for the one track \\"Laughing\\" this is a must have. The vocals on this one bring chills to your spine and tears to your eyes as the genius of this guy really comes alive. With Crosby, it is all about the harmonies and the middle notes that he owns like no one else. If you want to journey back in time to a more innocent time then kick back with this debut solo effort from one of the best writers and vocalists in popular music. It will leave you with a warm feeling - guaranteed.
0380730367|5.0|Never one to be deterred by legal \\"technicalities\\" when he solves his cases, Patrick Kenzie, a Boston private detective, is up to his eyeballs in his own problems when Karen Nichols asks him to stop a stalker.  Kenzie and his long-time partner/sometimes lover Angie Gennaro have worked together in four previous Dennis Lehane novels, but they have now split, and Kenzie is at loose ends.  After solving Karen's problem, he ignores a later phone call, then reads six months later that she has jumped to her death.  Thinking that she must have had a new problem that he was too \\"busy\\" to investigate, he wonders if he might have contributed to her death and feels honor bound to find out why she jumped.<br /><br />As Kenzie investigates Karen's background and family, he turns up what may be the most dysfunctional family situation ever created.  But he also discovers that Karen led a totally different life at the time of her death than the seemingly innocent and vulnerable life she led just six months before.  Her mother and stepfather are unfazed by her death--and no one misses her or mourns her--except Kenzie, who is more curious than mournful.  Teaming up once again with Angie, who helped him with an early aspect of the case, he continues his investigation, eventually calling upon Bubba Rogowski, another old friend, for help.  Rogowski, a Vietnam War vet with \\"lobster tails\\" of scars on his chest and hidden shrapnel within his chest, has even bigger scars and \\"shrapnel\\" within his psyche.<br /><br />As Kenzie uncovers Karen's long-time psychiatric problems and their origin within her family, the suspense ratchets up.  Karen's little half-sister died at the age of four, and her stepbrother Wesley has had no contact with the family for ten years.  Kenzie's insatiable curiosity about the family leads to new information that complicates what might have been a relatively straightforward case of family dysfunction and turns it into a case of manipulation, psychological warfare, and emotional torture.<br /><br />Lehane, an absolute master of suspense, juggles plot lines and complications with aplomb, in the process creating intense scenes filled with local color and oddball details. As his characters face (and create) scenes of stomach-turning violence (and even sadism), the focus remains on people, not violence for its own sake.  Though no one can claim that these are all rounded characters, they are usually unique, so fascinating that the reader always feels their behavior to be at least plausible--for them.

B0002IQAN6|5.0|The reason the material is on 2 discs is because hybrid SACDS hold more information (SACD material plus red book CD material) and thus cannot fit 80 minute of music on them. That is why this album is spread over 2 discs. It made more sense to split the album in half, just like the original LP, rather than put all but one song on the CD and then put the last song on the 2nd disc. The entire album would not have fit.    The same thing happened with Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Bring Road SACD - while the redbook CD is on 1 disc, the SACD version wouldn't have fit.    Don't think you're being ripped off. It's the price you pay for an audiophile listening experience.
1573229725|4.0|The first section of this book had me hooked. The labyrinthine underworld of Victorian London, the strange and intriguing characters and the nefarious plot set in motion are the books strongest points and they're at their best in the opening chapters. But by the end of the first section the emotional angst was getting to be a bit much, and the pornography-by-proxy in the second section seems like a 21st century cop out; seriously, the author had to resort to that in order to convey the heroine's bleak, oppressive life? The love story between the two heroines and their mutual betrayal ought to have been enough to carry the second heroine's pathos. When we get back to moving the plot forward, with one girl locked up in a madhouse and the other a prisoner in the London underworld the book begins to fascinate again. And that fascination lasts through a startling twist and a dramatic & emotional climax. But again, at the very conclusion of the book, the author throws in the porno stuff, which honestly distracts from the mystery, the romance and the drama of what would otherwise be a thrilling story.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I listened to this album without any expectations and was pleasantly suprised.  It is exactly the kind of indie pop/rock that I get into.  Everyone's tastes vary so listen to the samples before buying, but if you like upbeat alt rock like Fountains of Wayne, then this is probably to your tastes as well.<br /><br />I can hear a blend of influences from the Postal Service to other hard to name 80's bands and more.  The lead vocalist espcially reminds me some 80's singer, but I can't put my finger on it.  The harmoies are good, intrumental playing well done and production is excellent.  Some orchestal instrumention is smattered into the tracks, but I don't find it overdone.  And it is catchy.  Very, very catchy.  I've had it spinning about 6 times through today and still have not gotten bored with it.<br /><br />Standouts for me are:<br /><br />* Mansard Roof (no idea what that is but this song makes me want to Google it)<br />* Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa - with a title like that, it has to be good<br />* Bryn -  nice welsh sound to it<br />* One (Blake's Got A New Face) - good for you Blake ol boy!<br />* Walcott (Get out of Cape Cod tonight!)<br />* The Kids Don't Stand A Chance - slow builder and a great closer to the album<br /><br />Is this a classic in the making?  Perhaps, perhaps not.  Most of all it is a fun album, and should be listened to with that in mind.  Please to enjoy.
B00065MDS6|5.0|I had this album in High School on 33rpm. The album is still alive and has achieved a youthful insight with a cultural tag of it is ahead of its time again.<br />The \\"one hand slap\\" track is always a really good metaphor for so many things - sometimes good sometimes not. The songs in this album I use strongly in relearning an archetype on this positive of a Gilgamesh positive - just as in the beginning, there would be a two edge sword, it helps me riff on my Les Paul now with high end processing that in the early market, a person needed high skills when electronic processing now evades much with just a power from me turned into sound.<br /><br />The album is great for full enlarged social occasions where you really need the person for more than a meal.
1401300529|1.0|In a word, a terrible read - long on partisan prejudice and short on scholarship (especially since this is a recent book and the declassification of information prior to its publishing should have at a minimum tempered much of the author's writing). But then again on should not be surprised by someone who others claimed covered the Viet Nam war from his desk in Saigon; and who likewise have said he created articles to coincide with his pessimistic view of the conflict. That said, one can skip the first 300 pages (which basically deal with MacArthur being a narcissist and Truman as the victim of circumstances - neither of which is fully true) if one wishes to read real life accounts of the brave men who were caught up in a deadly conflict. Likewise, one can skip the last 75 pages of this epic snooze fest as they deal with the aftermath of Korea in terms that are self-serving to the author's point of view.     As this is a long book (i.e. 661 pages), I thought eventually I would get into an interesting read. Needless to say the subject matter is compelling. Unfortunately, after reading The Coldest Winter I feel like I was snookered. All in all, if one values their time they should avoid this book.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|I waited a long time for this release, and it proves to be well worth the wait.  Ms. Yamagata will obviously never \\"sell out\\" just to sell records.  With beautifully soaring vocals and instrumental arrangements Rachael stays true to her roots.  You have to respect a woman who writes ALL of her own songs.  (I don't understand the parental advisory - I heard nothing even close to offensive.)  True fans will not be disappointed and new ones will be pleasantly surprised by the beauty and sometimes heartbreaking honesty in her lyrics.  I first thought \\"Oh boy, TWO discs? Why does she have to be so different?\\"  But after listening, two discs makes sense, showing progression from sadness to see ya! I do look forward to the day she is a relationship and we get to hear the happy stuff! Buy it.  If you get a chance to see her live- go! She is very gracious, funny and entertaining.

B0019X3ZZY|4.0|The title of this review is what I was thinking, when I witnessed the \\"Feast\\". LOL But seriously, I have seen some of the most controversial films ever made. This ranks up there with the best of them. (Or the worst, depending on your point of view) It probably surpasses most, in shock value. Made in the 70s, it still has high shock value, even by today's standards. This movie helps me to better understand why they locked up the Marquis de Sade. If there wasn't so much gay stuff in this unintentional comedy, I may have given it 5 stars.    The movie is definitely not for everybody...read allot of reviews, and then decide for yourself.

B00005JPS8|4.0|Iron Man works on many levels--as an action movie with lots of explosions, fights, and great special effects--but also a sophisticated comedy poking fun at the genre--or finally a character driven drama that explores complex and conflicted characters. Robert Downey Jr. is a perfect choice to play bad boy/genius/arms merchant Tony Stark. He could almost be playing himself, except for the arms merchant part. It is great to see Robert Downey Jr. clean and sober after his well publicized bout with drugs. But his checkered past gives him just the edge to play the jaded Stark:<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: [walking in on Stark's robots trying to get him out of the Iron Man suit] What is going on here?<br />Tony Stark: Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.<br />Virginia 'Pepper' Potts: Are those bullet holes?<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />According to an interview, Downey got off the drugs after an epiphany involving a cheeseburger from Burger King. An interesting parallel developed in Iron Man where Tony Stark was captured in a foreign land, then when he escaped and got back on US soil, the first thing he craved was a cheeseburger. Product placement? Perhaps, but what could be more American? Someone said after Elvis died that it was as if there would suddenly be no more cheeseburgers. Of course, Tony Stark and Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) also love pizza from New York. One more thing, there is a really clever reference to the game 'Operation' a generational touchstone familiar to those of Stark's generation, but one that went right over the heads of the young Pepper Potts (Gweneth Paltrow).<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. did a lot of ad libs, and his quick quips and clever comebacks added quite a lot to Iron Man:<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Christine Everheart: Mr. Stark! Christine Everheart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?<br />Hogan: [whispers to Stark] She's cute.<br />Tony Stark: [whispers to Hogan] She's alright?<br />[turns around]<br />Tony Stark: Hi!<br />Christine Everheart: Hi.<br />Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay, go.<br />Christine Everheart: You've been called the Da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?<br />Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.<br />Christine Everheart: And what do you say to your other nickname, the Merchant of Death?<br />Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess... Berkeley?<br />Christine Everheart: Brown, actually.<br />Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we got. I guarantee you the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.<br />Christine Everheart: Rehearse that much?<br />Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.<br />Christine Everheart: I can see that.<br />Tony Stark: I'd like to show you firsthand.<br />=================================================<br /><br />Jon Favreau did a great job of directing. Like I said, it works on many levels, much to his credit. He's come a long way since 'Swingers' but I noticed right away his obvious talent. He proved he could do a movie with a small budget, but Wow, look what he can do with a huge budget! This film reminds me a little bit of Transformers, what with the special effects and giant robotic battles, but that film also had compelling human characters to give meaning to all the sound and fury. The teenage traumas and dramas of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) made it all signify something, which was quite a feat, considering it was a movie based on toys. 'Iron Man,' thanks to clever direction by Favreau and the personality of Downey Jr. managed a similar feat. In the tsunami of Super Hero/comic book blockbusters, it really stands out. Favreau really 'got it' that as much as machines and technology fascinate us, it is still the human element that finally connects. In 'Iron Man' there are plenty of examples of machines becoming more human--and vice versa. The whole Tony Stark with a mechanical heart, and then when he puts on the Iron Man suit? Or how about the other way around, when he talks to his machines as if they were people? There is a robotic arm that follows him around, eager to do his bidding. When he chastises it for being over zealous, it droops in despair that is so human and familiar.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, that reminds me. When Tony Stark is working with his machines and computers he is listening to \\"Institutionalized\\" by Suicidal Tendencies. Pepper Potts comes in and turns it down and he yells at her as if she were his mom. There is some cool music in 'Iron Man' but you keep waiting to hear the Black Sabbath tunage of the same name. Finally, as the credits roll, we get to hear that fabulous riff. Though just an instrumental version, it sounds fresh and I wondered if it was rerecorded for the film. Whether it is a new or old version, according to the credits, it is performed by Black Sabbath. After holding back and teasing us with it, Jon Favreau finally lets us hear it, and it sounds great.<br /><br />Jon Favreau ...

0385512058|5.0|I am a self employed entrepreneur and consultant.  The life blood of my business is my network and my ability to meet the right people and keep a steady stream of referrals coming in the door.  I have never met nor corresponded with Mr. Ferrazzi.  Having said that I think this is a fantastic networking book and well worth your investment of time and money.  Here is some of the areas I found excellent...    Conference Commando - He gives some excellent advice on how to attend conferences and make sure you meet the right people and get a lot more from the conference than simply information.  Using his advice will help you walk away with knowledge and some excellent connections.  If you pay to attend all of your own conferences like I do then you want to know how to make the most out of it and meet people that will help you grow your business.  This chapter of his book is incredible and VERY useful if you attend conferences and trade shows.    Connecting with Connectors - This is an excellent chapter on meeting with people that are natural connectors to a vast network of individuals you might want to know and are in a position to help you.  For example, PR people, journalists, and others who by virtue of their profession have the ability to connect you with a ton of excellent contacts.  The concept is about meeting a few people that can magnify your network in a powerful way and open some great doors for you.  I have deliberately sought out some of the people he says are super connectors and used his advice to build great relationships with them.  It has shaved years off my networking efforts.     Staying Connected - Personally one of my weaknesses has been staying in touch with people after a chance meeting.  Making sure they remember me when I call or email.  He offers a lot of great advice on how to maintain contact and a keep in touch program he calls \\"pinging\\" which was useful.    The book is simply incredible and has a TON of other useful pieces of advice and information in it.  Some of the negative reviews I have seen on this book claim it has nothing new in it.  I am not sure what book they were reading, but it wasn't this one.  This book has a ton of great ideas, anecdotes, and superb stories and examples to illustrate his points. Reading and applying the advice in this book WILL build your network and help you grow your business.
B0007XT87G|5.0|My discovery of Porcupine Tree just a little over a year ago was a musical revelation of sorts. Porcupine Tree has really inspired me, more than any modern band, with the way they can synthesize a wide array of influences into a completely unique and well-crafted album. Steven Wilson certainly is a musician and producer with extraordinary range, and myriad influences. His career as a musician with IEM, No-Man, Bass Communion, Blackfield and Porcupine Tree has spanned the range of electronica, ambient, pop, metal and psychodelica, and his production of albums from the raw simplicity of Anja Garbarek to the crushing death metal of Opeth showcase his amazing musical capability and attention to detail.    Porcupine Tree's latest studio album \\"Deadwing\\" defies characterization, with their trademark pristine production, attention to nuanced detail, and intelligent songwriting. I love Porcupine Tree's ability to easily switch gears from a straight-forward groove rocker like \\"Halo\\" to a subtle ballad like \\"Lazarus,\\" and then transition to the centerpiece of the album \\"Arriving Somewhere Not Here\\" which builds from quiet ambient to full metallic power.    As with their previous album \\"In Absentia,\\" and much of the rest of their catalog, the band creates accessible yet challenging pieces that still seem fresh after many repeated listens. Although incredibly talented, it seems to me that the band is almost incapable of showboating, and they prefer to let musical nuggets like the offbeat groove in \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" or the touch of the fuzz-wah solo in the self-covered \\"Shesmovedon\\" reveal themselves over the span of multiple listens.
0375826726|1.0|The book was such a disappointment to me it has driven me for the first time to post my opinion for Amazon, this is not a review. Those that have read the inheritance series to this point will want to purchase the book, albeit used or in paper back; because of the previous time spent in Alagaesia. The book was dull and filled with bland plot lines. Most of my complaints have been thoroughly covered by previous posters. My main agenda is to lower the rating for the book, which is deceiving to those who have yet to purchase the novel.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|This DVD, which was taken from a headlining show during the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour, shows Avenged Sevenfold at their peak.  They've truly hit their stride as musicians and performers with this DVD.  All the songs sound great.  M. Shadows voice held up remarkably well.  The only downside is that you will want to hear more songs.  Songs like \\"Chapter Four\\" and \\"I Won't See You Tonight\\", which sound amazing live, are not on this DVD.  I would've liked to have seen \\"Beast & the Harlot\\" removed and have one of the other songs mentioned beforehand replace it.      As far as the \\"Diamonds in the Rough\\" CD is concerned, don't think that it's an amateur attempt to boost DVD sales by throwing in a couple of songs that didn't make any other \\"official\\" A7X release.  Any of these songs could have easily been on their last self titled album.  For me, the high points on the album were tracks 5 and 6: \\"Until the End\\" and \\"Tension.\\"  It's a good album overall and combined with the DVD makes it worth the buy for old and new fans alike.
B001AKTZO6|5.0|I've seen self-appointed critics label CCR a \\"singles band\\" but that's bunk. Albums like [[ASIN:B001GH1KQ4 Bayou Country]], [[ASIN:B001GH5HN6 Willy And The Poor Boys]] and [[ASIN:B001GH5GDC Cosmo's Factory]] disprove that attempt at belittling their legacy.<br /><br />For my money the best thing CCR ever laid to vinyl didn't even make it to the knockout compilation [[ASIN:B000000XB9 Chronicle]]. I'm referring, of course, to the opening track here, and the b-side of \\"Proud Mary\\", \\"Born On The Bayou\\". The a-side is present and accounted for here as well. The album closer, the almost eight minute long \\"Keep On Chooglin'\\" is also a must for even the casual fan of CCR. Such a song that so well defines a band's sound should also have made it to the definitive compilation.<br /><br />In the days before Amazon's mp3 downloads I was determined to have \\"Born On The Bayou\\" on CD. Since I already owned [[ASIN:B000000XB9 Chronicle]] on CD I was reluctant to shell out for a whole album but in this case my venture was well-rewarded. This is a great album. Oh, I don't really have any use for the least of the set, the Little Richard cover, but it certainly doesn't harm the album. If one was to download individual tracks to complement [[ASIN:B000000XB9 Chronicle]], the tracks already named would be must-haves, but seriously, just spring for the whole thing. Only one of the seven tracks is on the 'best of' and when you hear the other six here, you will be very glad you added this to your collection. It's as solid, consistent, and distinctive as any of the Doors' best albums from this same era.
031606792X|5.0|It is hard to imagine a vampire and werewolf story being about love and abstinence, but Breaking Dawn by Stephenie Meyer, gives the reader exactly that.  It demonstrates the power of abstinence and selflessness when one is in love. The fourth book in the Twilight Saga brings Bella and Edward together in marriage that leads to a surprise twist. Jacob and his wolf pack and the Cullen family with friends join forces to fight the Volturi in order to save someone they mutually love.  Breaking Dawn brilliantly resolves the questions and plots developed in the first three novels in the series. There is something for the romanticist, mystery lover, and vampire or werewolf fan.
B000068IEU|4.0|*possible spoilers*  I orginally saw this movie, when my parents took us to the drive in, back in the early 70's.  I may have been 6 or 7 years old.  I was able to rent the movie tonight and rewatch it for the 1st time in 30 something years.  So as you can imagine it is extremly dated, and it shows it's age.  It is NOT a feel good movie, so if you are expecting 90 mins of fun and excitement, forget it.  There are no special effects and the budget is obviously very small.  However I felt that the directing was excellent and this is a very powerful movie and not for the squemish.  The bumbling cops in the movie provided some very needed comic releif to offset the extremly disturbing subject matter.  Let's face it the kidnapping, rape, mutilation and murder of two young teenage girls is bad enough.  It is hard to watch at times, expecially due to the fact that the murders take place in such close proximtity to the girls home, where the gang of rapists and murderes end up after they commit their horrific crimes.  Again this movie is not entertaining in the least, but, I gave it four stars because it does succeed in it's intended purpose. It's shocking and horrific and a parents worst nightmare come true.  You may find yourself cheering on the parents of Mary when they discover the truth and plot their revenge.  Maybe that was the purpose of the film to feel that bit of satisfaction when the villians get what is comeing to them.  Hmmm.  something to think about if you would like to see it.
0375826726|2.0|I just finished the book off last night.  Yes, it was a book that I tried to read every chance I got.  So why do I mark it with 2 stars?  Well, lets just say that it took me about a week and half to get through the book when it typically takes me a few days.  I kept falling asleep on the book!  I must have fallen asleep about 10 times!    Let me start off by saying that the book was nothing but a filler book.  It felt like Paolini wrote the book just to make extra money off of the fans of the series.  It had no plot to really drive it.  I found myself asking, \\"Where in the world is he taking this?\\"    Piece by piece review:  Eragon and Roran going after the Razac wasn't too bad.  I understand that Eragon has great abilities and the death of the Razac seems a bit easy, but at least it was more than a single page of battle and ending...    The character interaction between Eragon and Roran, hmm, it was nice that Paolini wanted to really place a human element into it, but in book 2 Roran is extremely upset with Eragon and suddenly in book 3 it seems like they are back to the good ol days...  The dialogue felt very cheesy and I didn't really feel the characters were the same as his prior books.  An example is Arya and Eragon's interaction.  In book 2 she felt friendly to show Eragon her world and when he made a move on her she would turn him down flat.  So flat that it gave new meaning to crash and burn.  Now in Brisingr, she seems so friendly and caring for him, like she now wants him.  Then Nasuada, she is this shy and timid girl and in the second book she seemed like a strong leader.  Now in this book she might as well be a man.  \\"My name is Nasuada and I'm going to do this trial of long knives...\\"  That was a complete waste of time!  Sorry, but the only purpose of it was more of a conversational piece.  Eragon saw the bandages on her arms and had to ask, \\"What happened?\\"  Good grief!    Another annoying thing about this book was the showing off of his extensive vocabulary.  If you notice, Paoini in many instances starts using out of the ordinary words.  Some of which makes you feel like you need the dictionary to read his writing!  Sorry, but Chris, you have to keep your target audience in perspective when you write.  Not all of us are Lit Majors in college.    Another review I read stated that the characters felt out of context with the language they used.  That goes back to what I said above.  He started giving Eragon, a 16 year old, the vocabulary of a lit major!    The wedding:  There is a war going on and here we have Roran needing to get married because he knocked up Katrina...  Need I say more?    So lets get to the war part now that I mention it.  From about page 450 and on, the book got interesting with the missions that Roran had to go on.  I was excited to read each chapter of his.  Then came the Insubordination chapter.  Ok, lets get realistic here.  Insubordination in today's military can be something serious, however, if your insubordination saves the entire battalion's lives, you are awarded for it.  Here Roran thinks on his feet to keep his men alive and he gets 50 lashes?!?!?!?!  Sorry but if you are trying to make the story interesting, then that is a turn off.  Why?  Because immediately after he gets whipped, he is asked to lead a group or Urgals and humans on a mission.  Something wrong there.    Now onto the Dwarf king election.  Yes it got so boring that he had to throw in an assassination attempt.      As you can see, I can go on and on...  I think I've said enough though.  I will definitely send a review to him if I can find something for his fans to emailing.  I am sure he is getting a ton of email at this point but what's one more!
B000001ES4|5.0|Simply put, this may be the best 'new age' CD ever recorded.  This is their magnum opus, and contains the most beautiful piece of music ever recorded in my opinion, the hauntingly splendid and emotional Hymn to Hope.  No matter how many times I hear this song, it touches me deeply.  The entire CD is wonderful, highly recommended for anyone who simply desires for music to take them to another place, a much higher place.
0345472322|5.0|We've always used the phrases \\"open-minded\\" and \\"closed-minded,\\" but after reading this book, you will use them more discriminantly...<br /><br />The author (Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D.) conducted extensive research which proves that the view we adoopt of ourselves profoundly affects the way that we lead our lives. It also reveals that your mindset can determine whether you become the person you want to be, and whether you accomplish what you are truly capable of.<br /><br />Her conclusion is that we all have a fixed (or closed) mindset, which is characterized by the belief that your qualities are carved in stone; or a growth (open) mindset, which is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things that you can cultivate through your efforts and influenced by our early development.<br /><br />After quickly establishing her premise, she uses the remainder of the book to illustrate how people with fixed mindsets view things that happen to them as a direct measure of their competence and worth, and those with a growth mindset don't take situations personally, but view them as a learning oppportunity to get better and grow as a result.<br /><br />She also includes stories which illsutrate how athletes such as Michael Jordan, Babe Ruth, Jackie-Joyner Kersee, and Marshall Faulk, used a growth mindset to achieve their great athletic accomplishments, in addition to she delving deep into corporate culture to unveil the perils and pervasiveness of the fixed mindset which toppled companies such as Enron, IBM, and Chrysler.<br /><br />It then moves into relationships, parenting, and general changes in life. Mindset is that rare kind of book you that you can read for a short period of time and instantly extract lessons from to immediately apply to use in your every endeavor. It will change the way you look at things, how people look at you, and change your life (for the better) in the process.
B000127LW2|1.0|I tried to give this a chance, but it was hard right off the bat with Janeway's \\"I prefer to be called 'Captain'\\". I guess she's just too special to follow the standard all the rest of Starfleet goes by. This just started her off in an unfavorable light and as my least favorite captain of all the series.    What broke the camel's back, however, was the episode in which she berates the crew for trading stories in order to get the tech to get home nearly instantly (granted it did not work). Consider that half the crew were in revolt against Starfleet. Now consider that the captain of the ship they are on refuses to let them get home because she feels trading tecj for stories violates the Prime Directive (the most over used and abused theme in all of Trek). Mutanies have happened over less on ships on which the entire crew was all aligned with the captain at the ofset. Yet the crew of Voyager say, \\"Oh, OK\\" and leave it at that. Sorry, but there would have been a full fledged revolt had something like that happened.    I just could not watch again (at least not regularly, I did catch a few here and there in later seasons) after that.
0452289963|1.0|There is nothing in this book that a person seeking to better themself doesn't already know.  I'm shocked at how many 5-star ratings this book has received.<br /><br />Tolle rehashes, repeats, and rephrases over, and over, and over.  The main points of the book could have been presented in half the pages.
B0007TKH66|2.0|I really wanted to like this series. The ship looked great, as did the uniforms, and the chance to see how the Federation was formed was too good to be true.    Literally.    Instead of getting the back story of Star Trek (doesn't anyone understand what a prequel is for?), we get all new aliens never before seen or mentioned, despite the massive effect they have on Earth.    Still, I tried to give this series a lit of slack, even defending it to a friend who gave up on it much sooner than I did. I explained away their naive and often idiotic decisions when encountering hostile aliens by the fact that they were more of the astronaught mentality, not military. That could only go so long.    What totally turned me off, however, was the episode in which Flox (sp?) discovered a cure for a dying alien race and decided NOT to treat them. Yep, that's the doctor I want on my ship. \\"Sorry Captain, but by contracting this disease, you are obviously SUPPOSED to die. Besides, if I cure you, Commander Tucker might not get to be promoted to Captain.\\"
B00022LRXA|4.0|Before and After Science being the 1977 release from Brian Eno is a very avant-garde record. In fact, it does not sound like anything I have heard before. It sounds like a mix between electronic music, rock, pop and something else. The lyrics are very strange and half of the time I am wondering what he is really singing about. As for the booklet. Well, it is atrocious. The cover looks like something cheap done in 5 minutes. That this was done by some hack named Ritva Saarikko actually meant that he got robbed. As for the drawings inside. Well, they are alright I suppose. But it looks like nothing special. It is strange to think that Phil Collins plays drums to this kind of music when one considers how tame his music has become of the years. 4/5.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Right off the top - good looking men in uniform all over the place  doing manly things.     I originally bought this as a VHS set at a thrift store to give to my brother. I do not have cable, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was not expecting much but a modern standard war movie that would probably turn me off. Not so. Being that it is based on true events, I found it fascinating.     The characters are fairly well-developed for as many as there are, though  I had a hard time figuring out who some of them were in relation to where I had seen them either earlier or later in the series.     I read a review online somewhere that said they had the same issue with it and that there was too much backdrop that it interferes with the characters. However, they had a lot of people in that company and they had to fill this one out with more characters than most people are used to seeing in one film.     I have now watched this 10 times and I am keeping it in my collection. Every time I watch it, I pick up on more and understand the characters and their situations a little better. I read somewhere else that another viewer's experience was greatly enhanced by reading the book along with the series.     The authentic detailing of the sets and the props really gave me some historical perspective on what that time period was like as it pertained to war. I learned much about the logistics of WWII, being largely uneducated on the subject.    The camera work is amazing as well and you can tell that Spielberg had something to do with the way this movie came out as an artistic piece.  The special effects are pretty good too.      There are also some really humorous scenes complimented by camera angles that I still like to watch. The acting is also superb in this film. Mathew Settle is one of the most handsome actors I've ever seen and does a great job of playing the effective, cool and collected Lt. Spiers.     I enjoyed the fact that there are interviews of the veterans who were actually in this company and talk of their experiences. A whole segment is dedicated just to them as well as having some shorter interviews before episodes.     Being a woman, the violence in it is not too bad - not like the serious blood, guts, and gore you see in other adventure or horror movies. However, it still gives you a realistic look of how horrible war is in terms of overall death and destruction.     I'm still wondering where they got the very thin people to play the concentration camp prisoners. I guess I am going to buy the DVD set for the extras and special features next.
B00005JKN9|2.0|This film is bad history. It misrepresents the situation in the five points in almost every way. It presents a bad history of the draft riots and worst of all it misreprents race relations of the period in ways that simply offensive.    What the director wants to do is make a dreamworld story of the salt-of-the-earth Irish rising against their \\"nativist\\" oppressors to bring about a new golden age in the streets of new york.    The problem for the director of course is the fact that his centerpiece for the film, the civil war draft riots, involves his heroic gangs going a racial rampage which involved acts of unbeleivable viciousness. The director tries his best to ignore such events. While he has no problem with violence in other parts of the film, the racial violence of the draft riots is something that he is shy about and repeatedly quick cuts away from. And his heroic Irish gangs of the five points just happen by coincidence to have been occupied fighting the nativists.    To make the hands of the noble Irish gangs even cleaner, the director makes their gang and even their church tolerant and integrated. If anything racial is to be said, the director makes sure Daniel-Day Lewis or one of his evil minions says the words.    And then there are the Chinese. The director totally misrepresents the tiny Chinese community of the era. While there were Chinese communities in the US in the era, they were not in New York. The chinese population at the time of the film was tiny and not mixed into the five points.    The nature of the five points itself is completely misrepresented. There was never anyone like Butcher Bill running the neighborhood. The bowery boys, the closest model to what is shown in the film, were as their name suggests located in the Bowery, not five points.    The other thing absolutely wrong in the film is how the police are shown (or not shown). The police of the era were a gang as much as any gang and they very much protected their own. If one of thepolice had been slaughtered and hung up as shown the film, they would have come down hard on everyone involved rather than (as in the film) ignoring it.    The point of the film could have been the continuity of gang violence in the five points and the continuity in terms of \\"gangs\\" cynically claiming to be for their people and against anyone different from them. It might have also been about the pointlessness of revenge. The director might have used the draft riots in particular to show how quickly \\"victim\\" becomes the new oppressor.     And if you really wanted an honest film, the film would have shown a five points with a mixed african-american and Irish population up to the draft riots at which point the Irish population turned on the african-american population with incredible violence.     On the positive side, in terms of sets and getting the look of the historical setting correct, the film is excellent. Daniel-Day Lewis also gives what I would consider his finest performance in the film and acts Leonardo DiCaprio off the screen. Cameron Diaz is miscast, in over her head in terms of acting and very forgettable.
B00005JPS8|5.0|One of the most recent in the Marvel Comic-book to screen translations of classic superheros, this time it's Iron Man about Tony Stark(Robert Downey Jr.); the young, egotistical heir to Stark Industries (weapon creators and manufactuers).<br /><br />On a routine trip in the middle east Tony gets taken prisoner and is demanded to build his newest weapon, the jericho, for these criminals. With a little help Tony plots his only way of escape, an iron suit.<br /><br />When Tony finally returns home he is a changed man, destined to return to seek his revenge on the men that held him captive, and of course  get his weapons back from the wrong hands.<br /><br />Similar to Batman Begins, Iron Man is more focused on the acts of Tony becomming the Iron Man, then infact jumping completely into an action packed adventure, amazingly it's thurough enough to get the full story yet the pace never draws too slow.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Mr. Tony Stark, he carries that perfect overconfident yet always believable attitude .<br /><br />One of the best superhero movies yet.
B001C08RHA|3.0|Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood. Decent overall but no particular stand-out points here.
0385340990|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a very good summer read. The end is, in my opinion, a \\"hallmark\\" ending; the mechanism of letter writing gets too, too much by the end of the book. But, on the way to the end, one learns a lot about life on Guernsey during WWll and about very decent people who did their very best to survive and even to flourish under war-time restrictions. It will not take you long to read this book. When you finish reading, you will say, \\"now that was nice.\\" Nancy Salen
B0017MO10U|5.0|As sad as it is that the series had to end, at least they have awesome movies to follow it up with.
B001CC7PKS|1.0|There are rumors circulating that the director's cut of Daredevil is much better than the theatrical version.  Further, they say this fixes many problems in the movie.  The theatrical version was poor because the bad studio execs made bad decisions about the final cut.    On the strength of these rumors, I bought a copy of this Blu-ray.  I wish I hadn't.  I am hear to tell you that all these reports are nothing in the world but a bunch of codswallop, poppycock, blarney and balderdash.  In every respect, the director's cut is worse than the theatrical version of the movie, not better.    The movie does not benefit at all from the extra thread including the trial of Coolio.  The studio was correct in discarding all those scenes.  It was a totally unnecessary plot thread, containing a lot of bad scenes full of bad dialog, badly delivered.  Including these bad scenes of bad dialog does not help resolve anything.  Rather, it creates a cheap, \\"made for TV\\" feel that was common with CBS movies in the 1970s-1980s.  It is paced like a snail, and feels way too long with this extra 34 minutes of footage.    The movie failed because Colin Farrel sunk the picture.  The quivering and shivering idiot he played was not Bullseye.  Also Michael Clark Duncan was a poor choice for the Kingpin.    After viewing the director's cut, I can say I categorically agree the studio's decision to cut all those scenes.  It was better before.
0930289234|5.0|I have to say this was my first graphic novel and I couldn't put it down. After reading this I was immediately hooked on any type of comic, the DC Universe especially! The illustrations are vibrant, the characters are wonderfully depicted by the author, and the story line is riveting. This is a great hero comic diffferent from the rest that is essential to every comic book reader's collection.
B000002KKS|4.0|Black Sabbath-Heaven And Hell ****<br /><br />The thing to remember with any release by Black Sabbath after the departure of Ozzy Osbourne is that none of the albums sound anything like classic sabbath in any way. Immediately the sound and style change here. Everything sounds more lush and more New Wave Of British Heavy Metal rather than classic metal. Tony Iommi opts for a more clean and sharper sound with his tone and strays from the doomy chugging guitar riffs. Bill and Geezer also tone it down quite a bit. Less power and bombast. The drums are less prominent while the bass is very noticeable. Most notably is the contrast in vocals. Ozzy was original, and while Dio has a killer and classic set of pipes it just feels out of place with Sabbath in my opinion.<br /><br />'Neon Knights' reminds me of heavier Deep Purple and more Rainbow than anything. 'Children Of The Sea' has a great guitar solo from Iommi, and his acoustic work at the beginning is wonderful though  does feel out of place. Dio's lyrics are also cheesy. 'Lady Evil' is a great track, and one of the best this line up ever wrote. A nice riff from Iommi and a decent set of lyrics from Dio though it borders on parody of a band that once was. The albums title track is among the best songs any line up of Sabbath ever recorded. Incredible musicianship all the way around and vocals and lyrics from Dio that would make Ozzy greatest work blush. Iommi's solo is also breathtaking toward the end of the song. The remaining half of the album is really hit or miss. Mostly sounding like Dio's solo albums to come. Namely Holy Diver. 'Wishing Well' while a great song feels out of place here and would on most any Sabbath album.<br /><br />So while a good album it really isn't a Black Sabbath album. None of the albums after Ozzy feel like Sabbath albums no matter which vocalist you look at. But if you look at the albums after as if they are from a different band than you can truly grade them fair. Heaven And Hell is a solid early 1980's heavy metal album with some great work from Iommi and Dio. The rest of the band feels flat and bored however. The bands next album Mob Rules was much, much better.<br /><br />The best way to describe it is like this; Bon Scott died and Brian Johnson joined AC/DC and it felt fine. David Lee Roth left and Sammy Hagar joined Van Halen and it didn't work at all. Still a decent band (I guess) but no way was it Van Halen. Same here, though this is actually worth checking out.al album with some great work from Iommi and Dio. The rest of the band feels flat and bored however.

B0012GMVXU|5.0|The music is incredible and the CD was in great condition. It arrived promptly and I am very happy with it.
B0002XMF5I|2.0|Black Sabbath-Born Again **<br /><br />Tony Iommi, the heart and soul of Black Sabbath and Ian Gillian formerly of Deep Purple making a Black Sabbath album together should have been gold...it wasn't. Gillians vocals sound like he is trying to sing while ridding a roller coaster because he sounds like he is falling and can't keep pitch. Of course the man can hit those high notes but damn that can get annoying when it is the only thing he is doing right on an already lame album. Beside Iommi's guitar work on the album is less than stellar and really leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />The opening track 'Trashed' is just stupid and Spinal Tap in every since of the joke. The lyrics are weak and the musicianship is well trashed. Then they go into 'Stonehenge' a track that should have been an intro or just left of completely because it also feels very Spinal Tap. 'Disturbing The Priest' starts out almost industrial than goes into something really bland and unbearable. 'Digital Bitch' just has to be a joke, it really had to be it was so bad. The title track is pretty decent though. It begins slow than sort of gets going but then never really delivers, but it is at least listenable. Though Gillian vocals can be a little abrasive here and his lyrics feel trite if you really focus on them.<br /><br />Born Again is among the worst releases in Black Sabbath history and just might be the worst. No question that it is the worst of the 1980's. What a shame, something that could have been amazing turned out to be trash.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|Would like to receive the product before I give a review.  It's been over a month since it supposedly shipped and I have yet to get it.  The sight that it was ordered from by Amazon.com does not exist and I have no way to contact them. Your assistance would be appreciated.  Thank you.  Charleen DeWitt
B000002KMY|5.0|Black Sabbath-Mob Rules ****1/2<br /><br />Mob Rules is leaps and bounds ahead of every other post Ozzy-era Black Sabbath release. Not only that but it is really one of the groups top albums of any line up.<br /><br />Appice is truly one of musics greatest drummers and he really shows that here. Very energetic and technically solid. Dio also manages to make his Dungeons and Dragons mystics work with Iommi here for the first time. Speaking of Iommi, the man is on fire here. Lightning quick solos and killer riffs to rival some of his most infamous work.<br /><br />'Turn Up The Night' opens the album and is easily one of the very best Sabbath songs on tape, or vinyl in this case. Super fast, almost thrash pace and more power than one song should be allowed to have. The title track is possibly the most brutal piece of music Iommi has ever laid down. Mixed with Dio's almost apocalyptic lyrics it is a instant classic. 'The Sign Of The Southern Cross' is a slow crawling pile of death. Sounds stupid I know but it is really the only way to describe it, hearing is believing. 'Slipping Away' sounds more like solo Dio than Sabbath but it works so that is okay.<br /><br />As previously stated Mob Rules is among Black Sabbaths greatest triumphs as a band. It is just too bad that the rest of the post Ozzy material wasn't this good.
B00005JMEW|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill - Volume One]]<br />This is my first Quentine Tarantino film. Editing is ultimate. Wow! What Music! Uma Thurman gives a terrific performance. I knever knew Michael Madsen or Carradine at that time. Both actors were my Dad's-time-guys. But after seeing Kill Bill, I have pin-ups of Madsen in my room. Paps always used to speak of 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Jackie Brown' etc..but they were not 'my-period' films. Even Daryl Hannah! I knew her only as the 'mermaid' from 'Splash'. I saw KILL BILL on the BIG SCREEN and became hooked. Now I do not miss a single film by Tarantino.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As many others have said, this series is brilliant both in terms of content and filming.  All I want to say is that this is (by far) the best-looking Blu-Ray I have yet seen.  It was the first one I got when I got my TV and BD player in December, and is still the one I bring out to show friends how great Blu-Ray is.  It's my reference for all others.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I watched this movie four times this week already, since it first premiered on DVD (saw it three times at the movie theaters).  I have to admit ... I saw \\"HEAT\\" eight times at the movie theaters (my personal record), so you can say that I'm \\"biased\\" towards Michael Mann's films.  His characters are always so REAL, and rich. I never feel like I'm watching stereotypical movie characters. I feel like I'm \\"peeking in\\" on someone's life. That's how I felt with Max and Vincent. They seemed so real to me. Most \\"hit man\\" roles don't seem real to me, but the character of Vincent did, as played by mega-star Tom Cruise.  Jamie Foxx almost stole the movie though with his best performance to date, with the possible exception of \\"Ray.\\" I loved everything about this movie, and his performance, particularly when he went to meet up with bad guy \\"Felix.\\" That scene was CLASSIC.  This movie gets FIVE STARS in my book. It's one you will want to watch over and over again.
1401307787|5.0|For someone growing up from a Buddhist culture, I feel the author has captured the essence of meditation. Specifically, the author reminds to practice meditation without feeling that you are better than everyone else, which is what I have felt. He also suggests to practice meditation without the goal of becoming a better person, more calm, more relaxed, more focused... etc. These are merely by-products of practicing meditation. So why do we do it? Better read the book to find out!    A reviewer who gave it 1 star says that \\"the book puts you to sleep.\\" This indeed happened to me a few times when I listened to the audio version of the book while trying to meditate. When I have much stress, this is actually a great way to get sound sleep without any meditation and therefore any side effects. And for this quality alone, I wish I can award the book 6 star.
B0013ND30M|5.0|To be very honest, I debated on whether or not to purchase this edition of Sleeping Beauty because I have the 2003 version.  I was skeptical because I was afraid that the bonus features on this new edition would excluded the Grand Canyon featurette and the Story of Peter Tchaikovsky until lo and behold, it was included.  I have yet to have seen all of the bonus features of the DVD but the film looks and sounds greater than the 2003 version  I noticed more detail and the sound was outstanding.  The Disneyland Walk-Through feature was just breathtaking as this was the version I never saw.    I strongly recommend this for any Disney fan!
0385340990|4.0|The epistolary novel form is a great conceit for telling the story of those occupied by the Germans on Guernsey Island in WWII.  I found myself reading this book slowly so it wouldn't end and used it as a treat to return to after a trying day or when I was feeling down. I admire books about people who keep that \\"stiff upper lip\\" through it all.  While this is fiction, of course, I'm imagine there were real people banding together for good during these trying times, just like in the book.
0375826726|2.0|One word....tedious.    At 700 some pages, Paloni detailed you to death on the most boring things in the world. This is a fantasy novel, where was the stuff that I loved about the first two books? There was a whole chapter devoted to the making of his sword. After a few pages, I thought, ok, I get it, difficult to make such an important weapon, can we move on now? And the details on all the politics of the various races, and blah blah blah. I only stuck with it because I now have an investment in this story line. However, I will not invest in the next one, to the library I will go!!! The only character that got to do anything interesting was Roran, and basically he was busy getting chopped to pieces and then fixed up. Chopped to pieces, then fixed up, etc.    Please, next time, don't give me all the details. Whatever plot line pieces were developed, got so lost in the myophic examination of irrelevant things, that I didn't catch them, and started to not be able to follow the story. J.K. Rowling published these massive novels, but I always wanted more. Sorry, Paloni, not so this time around. Bleh.
0671449028|5.0|Sandra Boynton has left her mark on the children's book industry and this is a great example of why she's been so successful.  The story and illustrations just appeal to kids and there's no secret that this is her formula.  Make going to bed fun and maybe, just maybe, it won't be such a chore!    Another bedtime story I'd recommend is Ladybug Baby Bug, by Janice and Mark Perkins, because of its similar qualities.
0060566108|4.0|I had to read this book for my management course and I thought it was going to be yet another boring business book, but IT IS AMAZING!! The authors made me completely rethink how I think companies achieve success and had some of the most in depth research I've come across.    It doesn't matter if you're in business or not, no matter who you are, you'll enjoy getting a fresh perspective that applies to business and our personal lives too. The book slows down towards the end, but overall it's a must read!
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Excellent extra's, and the packaging is amazing. Unfortunatley mine arrived a bit crumpled (the plastic square outer shell that is) but that's more to do with international shipping than anything else!

630469654X|5.0|Ladyhawke is even better revisited.<br /><br />I first saw this film in the theatres and on VHS over 20 years ago.  It has aged well, and like fine wine, improved.  Who couldn't fall in love with Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie.  Rutger Hauer, Matthew Broderick, and the cast created a mood film, that says 'Try and stop watching me'.  Add to the mix the Andrew Powell (Allan Parsons) soundtrack, and you have a winner.<br /><br />Fairy tale romance?  It's here.<br /><br />Swordplay...it's here!<br /><br />Classic film, pick Ladyhawke.  Schuler/Donner should be knighted for this film.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Right out of New England comes the College Rock sensation Vampire Weekend, and in tow they bring textbooks and lots of hype, complete with some afro-pop. What kind of combination is this? Well, being in the album's target demographic, I would say it's a great mix of smart lyrics and original rock that make for one heckuva indie pop rock album.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Oxford Comma\\" point out the ridiculousness of the English Grammar system saying, 'Who gives a frak about an Oxford Comma?' It's easy to breeze by the lyrics on songs like these, but if you blink, you might miss a great piece of smart and witty lyrical poetry. You can bet you'll spend many a minute delving into the linear notes.<br /><br />Between all the preppiness and college insider songs, you have fun and quirky dance songs like the immensely popular \\"A-Punk.\\" \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" (love that name) also provides for some fun, and highlights the infectious reggae guitar beats of the band. I just want to know what Peter Gabriel thinks of the song.<br /><br />In fact, I could only find one real quibble on this album, and that's the shout-back vocals on \\"One,\\" which sounds the old Pizza Hut pizza mascot from the old commercials. You know, that incredibly annoying piece of pizza that was their mascot back in the 90s I think it was? Anyways, that's what those vocals sound like. Another minor quibble might be the length, since the whole album clocks in at 30 minutes, but hey, the album is cheap enough and I'm not complaining.<br /><br />Overall, while I don't see much appeal for the album outside the indie rock or college arena, I do see a fun and quirky indie pop rock album with smart originality and flair. Call it nerd rock, call it frat rock, call it a college radio station's dream, I'm calling it a Vampire Weekend, and I hope this weekend never ends, because everybody hates Mondays.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|Great Cd!!!! The bonus tracks (except for\\" On The Tequila \\") realy worth the extra $$.
B001E95ZNI|5.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" is a welcomed return to the traditional western film. Directed by Ed Harris, this film about two men hired to protect a town from a villainous rancher who's killed the previous town Marshall is a terrific example of how the Western is THE American film genre. Like Kevin Costner's \\"Open Range,\\" \\"Appaloosa\\" is short on action, but features some terrific writing and fantastic performances by the likes of Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger and others that keep the film moving for the most part. Beautiful cinematography and a great score by Jeff Beal add this terrific film. If you enjoy westerns, then you'll definitely enjoy \\"Appaloosa.\\"<br />Movie Grade: A-

B001DPC52C|5.0|I typically order many things through Amazon but I was disappointed with this offering because there appears to be several versions available.  I realize that Amazon is offering the US release, which may not be their fault, but the European versions include so much more.  I am not trying to deter money away from Amazon with this post and who knows, maybe Amazon will offer these additional import versions in the near future.<br /><br />Anyway, there is a Blu-Ray version available along with a DVD (PAL).  There is also a (2) DVD version which maybe PAL which includes a (2) audio CD version as well, which is the entire concert and not selected songs from the concert like the US version on only (1) Audio CD.<br /><br />My 3 Star rating is based only what version the US is getting and not on the actual content/concert itself which I expect to be fantastic.  **UPDATE** Changed my 3 Star rating to 5 Star due to Blu-ray version.<br /><br />I ordered the Blu-Ray version and (2) DVD and (2) CD version directly from the Within Temptaion site at [...]  They are rather pricey in comparison though to the Amazon US version.  The Blu-Ray was around $32.50 while the (2) DVD, (2) CD version was around $39.  Shipping on top of that was another $25.  Ouch!  There may also be some concern whether or not the Blu-Ray is Region specific and whether or not it is going to play in a US PS3 or a US Blu-Ray player.  There is no mention on the Within Temptation site whether or not the Blu-Ray is Region Specific plus they do ship to the US.  I do know that PAL DVD's will play in a XBox 360 as I have Within Temptation PAL DVD's that play just fine.  In the end, I just wanted the Blu-Ray and the (2) CD's of the entire concert plus the extra DVD's include an additional concert that was filmed in 2007.<br /><br />Time will tell if all of this works out for me and the Blu-Ray plays fine or not.  It is just unfortunate, that US fans are subjected to an inferior product, just because Within Temptation,overall, is not as popular in the US as it is in Europe.  I would certainly hope that this would indicate my support for the group by willing to dish out over $90 for these recordings.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />Today, 10/13/08, I noticed on Amazon that they now have a version available that depicts a Blu-Ray cover for $53.99 although it lists the format as DVD.  This appears to be the Blu-Ray version and is listed as an import.  There are not any details listed whether this includes the extra DVD or not although I assume it would.  Thanks Amazon for those imports!!  It is great to have more choices!!<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />12/9/13<br />Sorry, for the very slow update.  Only 5 years late!  Just happened to be on Amazon and noticed I never updated the review once I received the product.  The Blu-ray does play on US Blu-ray players although I have run into some Blu-rays such as Black Robe that will not play on my Sony Blu-ray even though it is supposed to be Region FREE!  The video and production on the Blu-ray are simply outstanding and I highly recommend a Blu-ray version.  The CD's, of course, play fine but the DVD's are PAL so typically they will not play in most standard players although, I believe, PAL DVD's will play in the old HD DVD player add on for the Xbox 360.

B0011UCOGG|2.0|I was very much looking forward to this book. It took me awhile to read the first book but I flew through the second book. It really seemed like Chris had figured out his style and hit his stride. After reading the third book I'm wondering why there was a third book. I don't remeber anything in this book that really need to be drawn out so much. In fact the things thta would have been nice to have explained were glossed over or only touched upon for a few pages. I hope this is not another case of an author putting him\her self above the reader. I understand that writing is a form of expression, but at the same time you need to remember we the readers give you the moeny and outlet for your expressions. Please don't let us down with the 4th book!!
B001BWDG0W|1.0|One of my favorite numbers is missing from this soundtrack... namely Chiquitita! Also missing are the prologue and the musical numbers performed by the cast at the end of movie. The Broadway soundtrack has the prologue and Chiquitita, but not as famously performed by Baranski, Walters and Streep.
B001E75QGG|4.0|First thing is first...Have the right expectations!  Its annoying how many people are comparing this to the first 3 movies, and then saying it sucks.  Obviously it doesnt compare.  The first 3 were amazing, and among the best movies EVER made.  However, with all things considered(his age, time since last movie, no sean connery,etc) this was still a very fun and exciting movie to watch.  It was worth it just to see Harrison Ford on the big screen as Indy.      There were a couple scenes that were complete trash though(shia swinging on vines)...and personally i thought the ending was a little \\"out there\\".  But apart from that, this movie is well worth the purchase.      Dont expect this to be better than the other movies, but it is worthy of being called Indiana Jones.
0142403873|5.0|This is a very cute story!  A \\"must have\\" for all children's personal libraries. It is always so fun to get a great kids book and this is definitely one of them.  You won't be disappointed!  Our twin 3-year-old boys love it, and we parents love to read it!
B00000F6LQ|3.0|Well, the movie is awesome, the second DVD is awesome, all the little extras on both DVDs are great. Of course the film is grainy and such, it was meant to be that way.    Now, this version is not as good as another.  The Extraordinarily Deluxe Edition.  It has the DVD and the second DVD.  It also includes the old album that was released of the film ow on CD.  It is packaged nicely (it looks better than this version).    I think it is kewl that they were adding in the Script, but it is already on the DVD itself.  Plus if you just google, you can find it online very easily.  So it really isn't worth it to have it included for this much.  The Extraordinarily version is the one I recommend.  It's packaging looks much better as well as aranged better, it has the extra cd, and it costs less.  With the money you save, you can get some coconuts and play along with the movie.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of work.  Yamagata's voice is the perfect sound to go with the wonderful music on this collection.  Her lyrics put you right where the song is supposed to, and you can't help but put yourself in her shoes as she sings of things we have all gone through in relationships.  Amazing.  The \\"Duet\\" with Ray Lamontange is one of the best songs on the disc.  Ray's voice is the best out there today, and to hear it coupled with her's is a true gift to fans of the lost art of the singer/songwriter.  In today's manufactured garbage music that dominates the charts, it's good to know people like Rachel Yamagata and Ray LaMontange are still out there and work together to make amazing music.  By this and her debut...you will NOT be sorry.

0375826726|3.0|And it could have been so much shorter! Honestly, you could skip the first 500 pages and not miss much. I understand the need for character development but this is ridiculous. Wasn't that what the previous two books were for? A long winded, boring book until you start getting to the last third.    Truly, this should have been the last book. If Paolini hadn't wasted the first 500 pages he could have finished the series. I'm actually afraid of the fourth book if it's going to be anything like Brisingr. Besides, I think I've figured out how this is going to end.

0316010669|4.0|The book is based on an interesting premise and the writing style is very easy to read, it really sucks you in.  I personally REALLY like Malcolm Gladwell's books/lectures/ideas -- he's defeinitely one of my favorites.    Note that after reading this book I'm not convinced that I completely agree with the fundamental arguement it's trying to make.  I also didn't like it as much as Gladwell's previous book, Tipping Point.  But, I don't want to sound overly critical.  What I consider high quality writing isn't based upon whether or not I agree with the arguement the author is trying to make.  The ideas are unique and creative and that alone is basis enough for me to give this book four stars.  One last note is that you might want to look at the rebuttal to this book titled Think! (I have not read it but if you find Blink interesting you would probably also like Think!).
0156030209|5.0|This book rates in my top 5 right next to The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. What you need to keep in mind is that it is a STORY, a FABLE, not meant to be perceived as reality. Although, I found a lot of it believable. Maybe not the meerkat island, but even that bit of the story was intriguiing. I wish he had stayed on the island a little longer.   I absolutely loved the meshing of three religions, the way he believed that God is everywhere. I loved the part where he thanks the Hindu diety for introducing him to Jesus. I think the main point in that part of the book is to say that there are many paths to God.   The castaway part was very intense, despite his being on a lifeboat alone with a tiger for so long.   In the end, you get to choose between the unrealistic story and one that is more beleiveable. Personally, I liked the animal story better. The second one is really sad. Again, keep in mind that the story is just that... a STORY. Otherwise you'll get caught up in all the mistakes and unrealistic details.  Overall, a wonderful story about God, survival, and self-preservation.

B00002Z88D|2.0|For a typical fan, it's hard to take a good, hard look at the artistic failures of their favorite bands and acknowledge them. Even if the music's lousy, they'll probably rationalize it and come up with some pertinent excuse. I love Metallica and I love \\"classical\\" music. (Actually, the correct term is \\"erudite music\\"). But I don't particularly love this album.<br /><br />So, rabid Metallica fans, carefully hear (or better, read) my entire 2-star review first and then judge if it was reasonable or not. What I want to point out is:<br /><br />a) This is not a \\"classical meets Metallica\\" album.<br /><br />Check out Michael Kamen's r&eacute;sum&eacute;, people. He's a score composer - \\"The Dead Zone\\", \\"Highlander\\", the \\"Die Hard\\" series, the first \\"X-Men\\" movie, etc. Although most of the great soundtrack composers of the last century (John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, Eric Korngold, Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa) had a \\"classical\\" background, it's a completely different mindset. Scores are created to serve images and dialogues on the screen - they pull the emotional strings of the moviegoer, so to manipulate what he should feel at a certain scene. On the other hand, erudite music doesn't have the creative, financial & time constraints of score composition, which allows it more freedom to experiment. Plus, it doesn't serve anything but itself.<br /><br />So S&M is actually closer to a \\"scores meet Metallica\\" album. No wonder this record starts with a soundtrack composition - Ennio Morricone's \\"The Ecstasy of Gold\\", from the Spagguetti Western classic \\"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\\" (1966).<br /><br />b) This is not a \\"creative\\", \\"innovative\\" and \\"experimental\\" musical venture.<br /><br />No, not really. For the most part, this is Metallica matching the studio versions of their songs note-for-note and the SFO is scrambling to play around Metallica's songs. They took the safest route. What? Safest? Yes, safest, because...<br /><br />b.1) ...they get to play the songs exactly the way they are. Metallica are, notoriously, highly protective of their musical oeuvre. Check out the \\"Year and a Half\\" documentaries and you'll see the kind of temper tantrums producer Bob Rock had to deal with when he suggested changes to their songs. Whatever you do, don't tamper a Metallica song... ever! Nevertheless, I think the guys could have further downplayed their egos on this one. Have the orchestra musicians assume more active roles in Metallica's music - say, let the orchestra's lead violinist play one of the solos instead of Kirk... or something like that.<br /><br />b.2) It also pleases their hardcore fanbase, which wants to hear nearly identical versions of their favorite songs. That always striked me as being odd - if you want to hear the songs always played exactly in the same manner, stick to their studio albums. I have always thought that a live record is a situation where you can add something fresh to the songs but, apart from SFO's inclusion in the proceedings, S&M sounds like the same old...<br /><br />All in all, this record won't convert many metal fans to \\"classical\\" music. That is a shame, because Metallica have always borrowed from the erudite music cannon.  Cliff Burton's \\"Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)\\" bass solo, for example, heavily quotes from one of Bach's fugues. Another example is their Diamond Head cover \\"I Am Evil\\", which quotes ipsis literis the introduction of Gustav Holst's \\"Mars, the Bringer of War\\". There's other examples... I'll add them later, if I can.<br /><br />I like Metallica - and that's why I won't give them a 1-star review. I can't give them a higher-rating review because I really feel duped. There's so much they could have done with SF's Orchestra, but they opted to play it safe... Is that middle-age sinking in? And they should have hired a proper \\"classical\\" maestro - that could have done so much for the music too. Claudio Abbado, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Lorin Maazel, Pierre Boulez, Valery Gergiev, and the list goes on...<br /><br />...but well, nevermind.
B00002616T|5.0|This one of the best keith jarrett groups from the mid seventies  Great album it has every groove and style within a jazz setting.  You have to hear all the 4 players play this stuff this is one of his best groups  he had then.
0380730405|5.0|Warning: spoiler<br /><br />A fantastic novel, that deserves a place next to \\"Wuthering Hights\\", \\"Great Expectations\\" or \\"Jane Eyre\\". Daphne Dumaurier's beautiful and rich writing style and amazing storytelling skills make this novel great fun to read. She handles the character development wonderfully well, in particular the overly sensitive and devoted heroine, the sinister housekeeper Mrs. Danvers, the despicable playboy Favell, and the gloomy and jaded Max de Winter.<br /><br />The novel works on many levels. There are some elements of the old fairy-tales Cinderella (servant-girl marries nobleman) and Bluebeard (forbidden room, murderous husband), but with a different, surprising twist. It's also a story of growing-up, as the nameless heroine matures from a timid girl into a strong-willed woman during her various trials. The author brilliantly disguises the characters' motivations, so that the true causes of things remain a mystery until about two-thirds into the novel when the main crisis unfolds. We then realise that the heroine, who sees things through the lens of her own feelings of inferiority completely misses the truth, which is to her a shock and relief at the same time.<br /><br />Not least, the lush, rich descriptions of the house and the surrounding Cornwell country-side, and linking of the natural elements with the mood of the story makes this novel a truly satisfying reading experience. You may not want to read another novel for a long time.<br /><br />Also of interest to readers would be Alfred Hitchcock's film Rebecca, which faithfully recreates the novel, with an outstanding cast.

B001CTA1T8|3.0|Why is it that movies about animals are inherently depressing? When did an animal's harm and/or death become so much more unendurable than a human's? It probably stems back to the final scenes of \\"Old Yeller,\\" when Travis' mother wants to put the rabid dog out of his misery by shooting him. As the audience starts bawling, Travis grabs hold of the gun: \\"No, Mama. He was my dog. I'll do it.\\" No such scene exists in \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua,\\" thank God, but the idea of an adorable dog getting lost far away from home is still pretty heart-wrenching, especially for the younger audiences this movie was made for. Adults will probably know right off the bat that everything will be all right, just as they will probably realize that the filmmakers did not have them in mind (I should know--I'm an adult). \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is a lot like a stray dog: It's cute but also a little mean, and not too many people will have the wherewithal to take it in.    If the sight of lapdogs wearing needlessly expensive clothing disgusts you, as it does me, then the beginning of this movie is not for you. It takes place in Beverly Hills, where it seems that the richest people over-pamper their pets. Toy dogs--like poodles, pugs, Yorkshire terriers, and Chihuahuas--are carried in designer bags to doggie spas, where they're fed prime rib and bottled water as they're being groomed. One dog has sections of its hair folded in strips of aluminum foil. Highlights are so becoming on a dog, wouldn't you agree? A few of them walk on miniature treadmills, because goodness knows a dog can't get enough exercise running through a park. Living in the midst of this extravagance is a Chihuahua named Chloe, a live action dog with a computer-generated mouth (voiced by Drew Barrymore). Her wealthy owner, Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis), operates a cosmetics company.    When Vivian is called away to Capri on business, she asks her niece, Rachel (Piper Perabo), to watch Chloe for her. Rachel makes it clear to her friends that she doesn't care much for her aunt's dog; she's spoiled and manipulative. Likewise, Chloe isn't too fond of Rachel, and she tells this to all her dog friends as they lounge by the pool on their own floating lounge; Rachel, in her eyes, is mean and irresponsible.    Hoping to have some fun while Vivian is away, Rachel and her friends drive into Mexico for a mini vacation (one look at her aunt's gigantic mansion is enough to make the idea seem silly). Chloe is forced to go with them since, apparently, no one else in Beverly Hills is available to watch a dog. Once they arrive, Chloe is kidnapped by Vasquez (José María Yazpik), a vile man who operates an underground dogfighting ring in Mexico City. The idea that a kid's movie would make light of something so reprehensible is appalling; the filmmakers show numerous shots of dogs trapped in cages, and yet they handle those moments innocently, almost playfully. The dog pound scene in \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" was more serious than this, even with the inclusion of a musical number. Chloe escapes with the help of a German shepherd named Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), who was once a police dog but let go when he psychosomatically lost his sense of smell. Once Vasquez realizes how important Chloe is, he relies on his vicious Rottweiler, Diablo (voiced by Edward James Olmos), to retrieve her.    As Chloe and Delgado travel through Mexico, Rachel begins a frantic search effort. At her side are Vivian's landscaper, Sam Cortez (Manolo Cardona), and his pet Chihuahua, Papi (voiced by George Lopez), who loves Chloe with all his heart. Contrary to what the ads for this movie claim, Papi is not the main character. He's barely a supporting character, which is just as well seeing as he's probably the least interesting. All he does is love Chloe blindly and say witty things like, \\"Hold your tacos!\\" and \\"Let's go kick some tail!\\" The most interesting side character is Manuel (voiced by Cheech Marin), a rat who gets by as a con artist with an iguana named Chico (voiced by Paul Rodriguez). One of the reasons he's the most interesting is because he's also the least logical; he wants to steal Chloe's collar because it's covered with diamonds. One wonders: As a rat, how does he hope to cash in on the collar? Are we to assume there are underground rat organizations with secret stashes of money? Even if there are, how does Manuel plan on spending his money? Are there upscale stores I'm not aware of with an interspecies clientele?    \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" gets less and less plausible as it nears its end, not helped by the fact that the settings become too exotic. At one point, Chloe and Delgado meet a tribe of Chihuahuas living in a long-since abandoned Mesoamerican temple city. Are we really supposed to believe that such a thing would be possible, even within the context of a kid's movie? And why on earth did Plácido Domingo, one third of the Three Tenors, agree to voice the leader of the Chihuahuas? A man of such prestige deserves better than a below-average family film. I can say the same thing for pretty much all the actors. \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is not the charming comedy it wanted to be--it's jokey, broad, and even at its most sterile, there are moments when it's very sad. Films with animal casts can have that effect, which makes me wonder why we still make them.

B000NA1OXY|5.0|\\"The best damn thing,\\" mega popular singer Avril Lavigne's third album is packed with fun songs and heartful ballads that will appeal to any teen girl.   The smash single \\"Girlfriend\\" is the first song, and invites you into this album as an energetic and powerful song. \\"Runaway\\" is milder in terms of energy and topic, but is fabulous to listen to anyway.  \\"The best damn thing\\" is reminiscent of cheerleaders, and is just as fun as \\"Girlfriend.\\"  \\"When you're gone\\" is one of the first slow, meaningful and almost-sad songs that are included. \\"Innocence\\" and \\"Keep holding on\\" are similarly categorized, but each unique and show case Lavigne's talent.  \\"One of those girls\\" and \\"Contagious\\" as well as \\"Hot\\" are like \\"Runaway\\"- catchy and addictive and perfect for preteens and early teenagers that do not like songs that are overly hyper. I love them all.  And then we have \\"I can do better,\\" \\"Everything back but you\\" and \\"I don't have to try.\\" A bit frantic sounding, but are still a good, quick listen.    Out of all of the songs by Avril Lavigne, the most that I like are definitely in this album, as I like every single one. My favorite songs by her is \\"Girlfriend,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" \\"Contagious\\" and \\"Keep Holding on.\\" More favorites include \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Complicated,\\" which I believe to be the best songs on her previous albums.    Here are my ratings and short descriptions.    1) Girlfriend (10/10)  Extremely fun and catchy and great as a ringtone  2) I can do better (7/10)  Not bad, but not a favorite. This is one of those songs where I like the verses better than the chorus, partly because of the lyrics, and partly because of its similarity to some other songs.  3) Runaway (10/10)  Love this song! Catchy and sticks in your mind long after listening.  4) The best damn thing (9/10)  Energetic and fun  5) When you're gone (10/10)  A song that is relatable and shows true vocal talent.  6) Everything back but you (8/10)  A bit frantic paced, but not bad at all. I don't think it really sounds like her, though.  7) Hot (9/10)  A lovely song that is both slow and fast and shows her versatility.  8) Innocence (10/10)  Touching and serious and melodious.  9) I don't have to try (8.5/10)  Interesting and different, which I like. Just a bit wild for my taste.  10) One of those girls (9/10)  Perfect for many different audiences and has a great chorus and is surprisingly easy to listen to.  11) Contagious (10/10)  Another fabulous song that I couldn't get enough of.  12) Keep holding on (9/10)  Featured in the Eragon movie, this is a great and heart felt song. It feels like Avril Lavigne is really sincere and believes her words strongly. It almost made me cry.    Avril Lavigne shows versatility and a wide vocal range and talent in this album. Perfect for most teenage girls (\\"Girlfriend,\\" \\"The Best Damn thing,\\" \\"One of those girls,\\" \\"I can do better\\"), some preteens (\\"Hot,\\" \\"When you're gone,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" \\"Contagious\\") and some young adults (\\"Innocence\\" and \\"Keep Holding on\\"  Many of these songs are appropriate for other audiences.  One more note: I've noticed that most reviews that are negative are not written by the target audience    UPDATE: After listening to this album for several months, \\"When You're Gone,\\" \\"Runaway,\\" \\"Contagious,\\" \\"The Best Damn Thing,\\" and \\"Everything back But You,\\" are my favorites, although I still enjoy all of the other songs. Definitely an album I'll still be listening to in the future.
B0018QCXGY|1.0|This was one STUPID movie, I have a 19.99(21.66 with tax)BlockBuster membership with Unlimited DVD's with 5 in-store exchanges.  I have only been watching Blue-Ray movies (to get my money's worth)so far.  Cloverfield was a waste of my families viewing time - we could not believe the stupid creature and the endings (there were 3 of them).      I now plan on reading all the the Amazon Blue-Ray reviews, BEFORE I rent any more movies.     As soon as BlockBuster deposits $30 in my paypal account(that was there promo for signing up), I plan on canceling.    I give Cloverfield 0 stars ( I wonder if this movie really made by superman's (chris Reeves) son (Matt Reeve)?    Update as of Today October 14, 2009 - Blockbuster has not put that $30 in my paypal account - so what I did (in August) was request 3(three) of the very best Bluerays, and I did not look back(no intention of returning them).  There is a rumor going around that BlockBuster Video they may be going bankrupt soon anyway.
0060578793|2.0|I don't understand the rave reviews on this book. For one, it tries to do too many things (badly) instead of concentrating on solid wilderness survival. I wanted to like it, but it has inconcistincies all over. It tries to cover (very badly...main advice \\"wear protective gear full body\\") even chemical attacks, flood, drought, etc. (where's the section on locust, and frogs?)   Seriously, they oversimplify complex things, that in my opinion have ZERO chance of working in the field (bolero? throwing stick?) and terrible illustrations that don't illustrate. Spear launcher, sheesh. a guy would die out there trying these things.  It is incomplete in it's advice (snares...you gotta know how to get your scent off of it) he should have written a whole chapter on snares, but explained in detail the theory, what you can expect to catch, simple but well explained snare types (keep it down to a few, but explain them well) and skinning instructions.     Seriously, this book is dangerously lacking in the right kind of information.     Plus instead of logically splitting up all info (like WATER...explain the basics common to all needs, but in the same chapter explain differences in arid, temperate, arctic, etc.)     For me it was a total waste of money.  I guess I could use it for kindling, or fire starting.

As I move reluctantly towards the end of the novel, I tried to take it slow but it's just impossible.  When you're suffering from an addiction, you crave for more, isn't it?    The story is about twins, but towards the end there is a major twist.    Best book I've read in 2008
B000002KHF|5.0|This is a truly great cd.  I had the album years ago and it is great to listen to it again.  Every song is awesome, and the lyrics and instrumentals are great as are the vocals!
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I picked this CD because my local independent CD store owner suggested it to me. This is how I choose most of my music and I am rarely dissapointed, however I also rarely fall so completely in love with a band as I have with Vampire Weekend.<br /><br />Having never heard one of their songs I put the record into my stereo expecting some sort of Emo-garage band sound to come out, heavy on the guitars and depressing lyrics (with a name like Vampire Weekend do you blame me?) and light on the melody. Imagine my joy when a melodic sound is emitted from my poor kia's admittably questionably speakers.<br /><br />It isn't hard to tell that someone in that band studied composition seriously. And the pure variety in the instruments used, for someone like me who grew up with an opera singing mother and a rock obsessed father, it's pure heaven to see a band actually take not only lyrics seriously but the entire feel and sound of a song.<br /><br />And as I've spent every summer of my life in Cape Cod I can't help but laugh at some of the lyrics (Walcott is a great song but Hyannis is the farthest thing from a ghetto in the world).<br /><br />All in all this CD has been on loop in my player for close to a week now, and I've yet to get bored of it. A miracle considering my short attention span.
B0016NF06O|5.0|I love this CD.  It's a great combination of Willie Nelson and good jazz.  It's definitely \\"feel good\\" music. I've always liked jazz and Willie Nelson so I figured I'd like it, but it's even better and I play it all the time.  Lots of good instrumental plus Willie's voice.  I have recommended it to friends.  Even my husband, who is not really a Willie fan and likes jazz sometimes, really likes it.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|Jennifer Hudson is a talented singer.  I really like her debut album.  My favorite tune on this disc is \\"Giving Myself Over To You\\".  The piano playing is beautiful on this song and throughout this disc.  Jennifer's vocals blew me away on \\"Giving Myself Over To You\\"  \\"Spotlight\\" is the another highlight on this disc.  This song is very upbeat and enjoyable to listen to.  The beat box on the track \\"Pocketbook is tight.  I like Ludacris' accompanying vocals too.  She shows the power in her voice on the track \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\".  I love this song.  \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" is a soulful duet with Fantasia Barrino.  \\"Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There\\" is a very good gospel song.  This is a very good disc and a strong debut.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|saying hat this is their best album since the black album doesnt mean much.<br />the black album was the beginning of the end and everything after it is mediocre<br />output at best. james hetfield lost his voice and started adopting some really annoying vocals, and the rest of the band simply lifting their foot off the gas and cruising along with not a hint of the passion and fire that blazed throughout every minute of their first 5 albums (yes, even the commercially driven black album is one of metallica's better times!).<br />if i make an effort, i can recall certain melodies off Load and Reload, despite the overall limpness of those albums and the awful vocals.<br />on the other hand, it's IMPOSSIBLE to recommit to memory ANY passage from st anger or death magnetic, even if my life depended on it. i listen to these albums and nothing stays in my mind from the experience. songs may be endlessly long (that's epic for you), the sound is horridly produced (that's raw and primal for you) and the volume may draw complaints from your neighbors, but you'll -very soon- find out that YOU are as tired as your neighbor, from the torturing sound that's only heavy for the sake of it. in the days when master of puppets was blaring out of my speakers, i'd never care if anybody found it too loud. and i still dont. on the opposite i always seek to punish the complainers with the volume cranked up an extra notch or three. we loved the content, not the dressing.<br />death magnetic is no doubt, as heavy as justice for all, but the similarities stop here.<br />it's like literally comparing a 5 foot tall overweight individual who weighs as much as a 6 foot athlete and saying that since they have the same weight, therefore they have equal abilities.<br />anyway, this is just to say that every new metallica album contains less soul than the one before, and this is really sthg hard for me to say, since i'm a longtime fan.<br />i'd still check those guys out whenever they put out a new work but i dont expect them to positively surprise me anymore.positively surprise me anymore.

B001E95ZNI|4.0|Lately, the westerns that have come out have all been far more burdened with an undercurrent of sadness then westerns of the past.  They also delve more into the psychology of their characters.  Long gone are the days when good guys could just be good because they were good people.  Now good guys have to carry a burden of sadness or a dark secret or a hidden \\"bad side.\\"  The bad guys also must have some baggage.  As movie-goers, we no longer accept (particularly in our dramas) simple tales of black & white.    I'm thinking of recent efforts staring with UNFORGIVEN, and following through with works like OPEN RANGE, 3:10 TO YUMA, even the Australian THE PROPOSITION.  Now comes APPALOOSA, starring, directed by and co-written by Ed Harris.  It , too, is \\"fraught\\" with undercurrents.      You're probably now thinking that I don't like this trend.  You couldn't be more wrong.  What westerns can do, more than any other genre right now, is show us how nothing is quite black & white anymore.  In UNFORGIVEN, for example, our \\"heroes\\" are men weary as heck from always relying on their guns.  They've tried to turn to more placid lives, only to find that the world of violence and killing is all they are suited for.  And the \\"bad\\" sheriff, played by Gene Hackman, is actually capable at delivering some sense of order to his town.  It's a \\"complex\\" story told in a genre that relies more on archetypes and formula than anything other than perhaps the sports-underdog genre.    APPALOOSA tells the story of another Western town, where the business leaders are under a reign of terror from local rancher and all-around bad guy Jeremy Irons.  Irons has killed the local marshal, so the town-leaders employ famous \\"marshal for hire\\" Ed Harris, who shows up along with his long-time deputy, Viggo Mortensen.  Harris is made the new marshal, and given pretty much unlimited power to do what it takes to clean up.    This part of the plot is not actually terribly interesting.  It is done well, but there are no glorious shoot-out scenes.  The violence (and there's enough) is fast, brutal and blunt.  But most of the time, Mortensen & Harris spend a lot of time sitting around with their guns, just watching for the bad guys.  This builds tension, and allows for some nice camera-work and some fun dialogue between Harris and Mortensen.  But if there were nothing else to the film, it would be a failure.    However, as with any good western, you've got to have a lady.  In this case, that lady is played by Renee Zellweger, a woman of limited means who comes to town and immediately captures the fancy of Harris.  While this portion of the movie goes down some very original, surprising and even complex places...I will tell you no more, because I'm not sure how I could without spoiling the fun.  Zellweger's character simply shakes up what all these characters think they know...and also defies our expectations of how her relationship with Harris, Mortensen & Irons will play out.    And as you might expect in a movie directed by a laconic, easy-going actor like Ed Harris, the actors are given plenty of room to \\"act.\\"  It's all very low-key, (almost minimalist for Harris and Mortensen), it also very well done.    Irons has the most clichéd character.  He lives up the billing of the \\"bad guy\\"...but as you might expect, he brings his usual oily smoothness to the part.  What he also brings is a touch of indignation.  He honestly seems to think that he's not such a bad guy...he's just a rancher determined to run his business.  We'd almost buy it, if we hadn't seen some of the other stuff he's capable of.  Irons also looks great in the part...western garb seems to suit him.    Zellweger gets a character full of surprising complexity to try on for size, and she mostly acquits herself well.  She's becoming so gaunt now that her eyes have nearly disappeared, and she can't quite get by on simply looking cute and spunky anymore.  But the film requires more of her, and she delivers.  She's not afraid to be unlikable when called for, and that is not something we've seen much from her before.  It was a good choice for her because she gets to stretch just a bit, but not completely out of her comfort zone.    Harris does a very nice job as well.  As a lawman/gun-for-hire, his character is extremely self-assured, competent, and merciless.  But when his heart is captured by a lady for the first time in his life, we see his internal struggle to adjust himself to the idea of trying to make another person happy.  This is all done with small gestures and a minimal of talking...but Harris lets us see everything clearly.  Director Harris has also made actor Harris as handsome and well-dressed as he possibly could be!  Is there any other actor working today who feels more \\"American?\\"    Most interesting of all may be Viggo Mortensen.  He's the guy who is the \\"faithful companion\\" to the more charismatic Harris.  He carries the big gun, he does what he is told and he knows when to speak and when to keep quiet.  His needs appear to be simple, and his love for his boss is quite evident (just to be clear, this is the \\"love\\" between friends).  Yet we can also tell that he sees the dynamics of things more clearly than Harris.  He understands much sooner and much more deeply just what Zellweger wants and needs.  And ultimately, he's willing to risk death to help things work out.  His performance also twinkles ever so slightly with good humor, and he and Harris have an easy chemistry that makes us believe these two men have been riding and killing together for a long time.  They are beyond thinking if they trust each other...they are, when it comes to shooting and law-making, at least, almost operating as one.  (One down note:  Mortensen has to deliver some voice-over narration at the very beginning and end of the film.  This device feels cheap and unneeded.)  Oh, and since I dwelled on everyone else's appearance (something I seldom do), Mortensen looks great as well,except he's given a beard the looks dreadful when filmed from the side.      APPALOOSA doesn't really break any new ground in the genre.  But it is still very entertaining, full of surprises and tells a good story.  It has humble aspirations, and fills them nicely.  You could certainly do far, far worse for two hours of entertainment.
B001CLG6RC|1.0|This album just seemed to be way too repetitive in the sounds and beats. Tried my best to listen to all the songs all the way through, and I regret that I did so. I like Enigma, but this album falls way short.  This album is inconsistent with their other work. Very disappointed!!
1594481717|2.0|Pink starts with the inarguable premise that we live in a changing economy. The smokestack industries moved overseas long since, and white-collar jobs are fast following. Countries with low labor costs, compared to the West, have growing pools of highly skilled technical workers. As a result, things like programming, accounting, and circuit design have changed from specialty skills to commodity tasks, just as happened with material goods like toasters, toys, and sneakers. Pink declares that the new differentiators include aesthetics, design, and the human experience. His examples include car manufacture considered as an art form, holistic legal services, and the medical value of doctors' empathy.<br /><br />Although I agree with many of Pink's points, the logical, left-brained underpinnings of his argument just aren't strong enough to support the weight of warm feelings piled onto them. For example, he notes that good product design has value to the product owner. Then, as a counter example, this book's front cover includes a die-cut that leaves little tongues of paper pointed out into the cut's opening. Those tongues catch on things, fray, and even tear into the cover around them. Mr. Pink: good design does not unintentionally self-destruct.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Pink notes the established fact that mothers commonly carry infants in their left arms. Because of a crossover in neural wiring, Pink asserts that this puts the child in contact with the woman's right brain. Well, maybe. It also frees the mother's right hand to stir the pot or do other work at the same time as kid care. Even left-handed mothers often carry their children on the left side, possibly because the heart is on the left and its rhythm tends to soothe the child. But no, Pink has taken the right-brain bit between his teeth and runs with it. As a result, he gently sweeps aside little things like the basic fact that right/left brain duality has always been stronger in men than in women, and that Asian researcher sometimes have trouble reproducing the results at all. It might, in fact, just be an artifact of Western males.<br /><br />I have an engineering degree, but art school training as well. At least one of the algorithms I developed was hard to describe, but physically obvious once my listener experienced it in her own hands - leaving her with the problem of explaining it to others. I understand the importance of the human terms in engineering equations. Unlike Pink, I also know that science and engineering are intuitive practices, and expressions of deep human feeling in themselves. I actually agree with Pink on many points. I just don't agree with his one-sided approach to two-sided problems, with his selectivity about facts friendly to his case, or with his weak logic in making the case that we need more than just logic.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdmetimes have trouble reproducing the results at all.

0375701427|5.0|I recently finished an outstandingly beautiful novel ([[ASIN:1601641591 THE MASTER PLANETS]]), and immediately went into one of those \\"I'll-Never-Find-Anything-As-Good-Again\\" funks. Then I found this book, which is not only a brilliant piece of literature (it's by Roth, after all), but also deals with some fascinating issues similar to those in Planets--issues I wanted to read more about.<br /><br />As just one example: I am not Jewish, but have noticed in certain writings something uniquely poignant in the Jewish love for America immediately after World War II. This was the country that had taken in many Jews' parents and grandparents in a way never before experienced, I believe. For the first time they were not outsiders, but simply immigrants in a land full of immigrants.  And for the first time, every opportunity--in this nation of bounteous opportunities--was open to them. It is not surprising that the name \\"America\\" would become almost a hymn on the lips of many American Jews in this period, that they would develop an unparalleled love for their country. As all of America basked in a cornucopian economy and the righteous sense that our own good works had entitled us to it, American Jews were, perhaps, \\"Ultimate Americans.\\" So it is also not surprising that, like everyone else, they also gave little thought to the idea that the richness of life here might be too well fed by our military industrial complex and exploitation of Third World nations.<br /><br />The protagonist, Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov, certainly does not think about these things, and therein lies his downfall. As Amazon reviewer Ian Muldoon (above) so aptly notes, the central question of the book is whether it is acceptable for Levov to to accept that he is one of the lucky ones and simply enjoy his place in time and history, or whether his good luck also carries an obligation. An inherently decent man, Levov does not look beyond his own life to wonder if it impinges on the lives of others. But his daughter cannot feel so sanguine. Merry has not had the good fortune of Seymour and his wife to be thought \\"perfect\\": She grew up with a terrible stutter, over which her beautiful parents agonized. Is this what gave her the ability (willingness? determination?) to see the fissures in the edifice they revere? In any event, she sees the fissures yawning, and her answer is to place sticks of dynamite in them -- and later to withdraw so far from the world that she scarcely eats so as not to \\"destroy plant life,\\" and will not even wash for fear of \\"harming the water.\\" She has started by demolishing the world around her, and is now obliterating herself. Miraculously, the stutter that at one time \\"terrified\\" Levov is gone... as she herself soon will be.<br /><br />AMERICAN PASTORAL is the story of a beautiful nation that, about 40 years ago, let some part of its best self slip away. As the \\"Ultimate American,\\" Levov is the perfect symbol. As he thinks, so thought we.t feel so sanguine.

0307394549|5.0|This is the best cookie recipe book I have ever seen.  Not only are all of the recipes amazing (I have made quite a few of them, and I trust all of Martha's recipes), but the front of the book has a picture cookie index.  Its a BRILLIANT idea.  All of the cookies have a photo with the name and page number and are divided into categories.  This is a great tool when you are trying to figure out which cookie to make.  Yes, you can get SOME of the recipes on-line too (you cannot get all of them, and some of them have different recipes on-line), and I often use Martha's website to see if there are any reviews about the recipes.  BUT, if you don't know what kind of cookie to make, or you want original ideas for cookies that you would never normally think of, this cookie book is perfect.  I cannot say enough good things about it.

B0013FNC38|5.0|To put into words the pure talent of Jason Mraz is like trying to describe the joy of a sunny afternoon. His musical ability is undisputed and his release We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things is a shining beacon of just how talented the man is. With effortless grace, he trapezes through musical genres like they're all second nature and doesn't blink at change in paces.<br /><br />With sounds sometimes reminiscent of John Mayer and Michael Buble, the album has sensitivity and smarts that are uncommon in many releases today. The use of acoustic guitar does not go unnoticed and adds to the pure beauty of the music which is contrary to the over-produced and synthesised releases which have been hyped up lately. His music has an honesty that is not about saving the world in a couple of minutes, nor is it the wailings of someone wanting their body touched.<br /><br />Mraz moves through his album with maturity and fearless ability. Stunning collaborations with Colbi Cailat on Lucky and James Morrison on Details In The Fabric are surprise gems that feature on the album. Then there is the superb track Only Human which would be right at home on Ministry Of Sound: Chillout Sessions. The other highlight track on the album is The Dynamo Of Volition which is somewhat reminisce of Australia's own John Butler Trio mixed with Jack Johnson.<br /><br />Sadly, the album probably won't pick up much air play on the radio as it's not the commercial bubble gum pop that wails across the air waves these days. The album is solid listening with no disappointments in any of the twelve tracks. His work is clean and friendly and very relaxing. To try and compare him with other artists is a discredit to his own natural talent because he really stands in the field on his own as a versatile artist who can produce fantastic listening that can't be ignored.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Like many Metallica fans, I was fearful that St. Cr@pola would be the end of the end for the band that has meant the most to me throughout my life. I had pretty much gone through all the stages of grief in the 5 years since St. Poo Poo was released. But, thankfully, like that trite saying goes: rumors of their death were greatly exaggerated.    I'm not a musical scholar: I only know what I like and don't like. And I like this. Alot. To make this short and sweet: this is their best album since \\"...And Justice For All.\\" Yes, even better than, IMHO, the critical-darling \\"The Black Album\\" (which I thought was pretty good, but not great).    I've formed this opinion not just because it's heavier (even though it is), but moreso because it's \\"angrier.\\" It's like once again, and like when they were first starting out as a band, Metallica had something to prove. They have a chip on their shoulder this time around and it shows. And in a good way. Oh, and the songs are really damn good. (See what happens when you write songs *before* you get to the studio?)    My belief is that Metallica fans since \\"Ride The Lightning\\" will like/love this album. Fans since \\"The Black Album\\" may or may not, but, hey, they're johnny-come-latelys anyway. And if they're any fans out there that came along  since \\"St. Anger\\", stay as far away from them as possible.
B000000YIQ|5.0|I have several Rollins albums in my collection like \\"The Bridge\\", \\"Alfie\\" and \\"Saxophone Collosus\\" but this one gets the most play on my system. Why?  It is a very free form Rollins captured spontaneously in the studio with probably the most empathetic sidemen he has ever had:  Shelly Manne and Ray Brown!!  A perfect example of this is when Manne completes the drum roll on his solo, Rollins duplicates this on his sax--pure alchemy!!  So if you're starting a Rollins collection, start with this one or \\"Saxophone Collosus\\"--you can't lose on either one!!

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|She can sing, she's got some catchy tunes and most of all, she kissed a girl. Katy Perry is about to take the world by storm with the release of her debut album One Of The Boys which is full of catching lyrics and memorable sounds.<br /><br />With her single I Kissed A Girl getting major airplay across Australia, there's probably very few who haven't heard of Katy Perry these days. It's grooving and infectious and a heap of spoofs popping up on YouTube including the inevitable I Kissed A Boy (Gay Remix).<br /><br />Another hit track on her album is Ur So Gay which is a blatant dig at emos. She asks why on earth she went out with a guy who wears more make up than she does. Her voice warbles a bit like Australia's own Kate Miller Heidke.<br /><br />This album goes from the dynamic pop of One of The Boys to the dancing electro of I Kissed A Girl and Hot `n' Cold. She also has a bit of a foray into the alternative scene with Ur So Gay. These are four of the best tracks on the album, although her talent shines through in all the tracks on this record. It's a great listen and at the end you're left wanting a bonus or hidden track so it isn't over just yet. Sorry, there's not.<br /><br />This is the album that Ashlee Simpson should have released to save the career, but she didn't. Fortunately for us though, Perry did! She's an injection of hot new talent to a stale industry which threatened to bombard us with more covers and repetitious disposable albums from soap stars. The album will grab your attention and will have you grinning at some of the lyrics, tapping your foot at a few others and listening attentively at the rest.<br /><br />Grab it, it's hot.

The designers showed great perception in having different levels of up-to-dateness and fashion among the various characters; the visuals are almost without fault, and the soundtrack is not bad at all.      On the other hand, Jane Austen should never seem fast-paced, even within the limitations of cutting a novel down to fit within 2 hours or so (there's a reason why there's a mystery series where the detective is Jane Austen herself) and there is also lacking in the movie a sense of Jane Austen's ineffable good humor.  People are all to willing to tell their secrets, and constantly saying \\"Oh, didn't you know? . . .\\"  and, for example, when Charlotte announces that she is to marry Mr. Collins, she exclaims, \\"Don't you dare judge me, Lizzie!\\" when there was no question of Elizabeth judging Charlotte in the book at all, only questioning her future happiness.    So you'll probably enjoy the movie more if you're not a Jane Austen fan to begin with than if you are.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|I Am Legend DVD<br /><br />I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.<br /><br />This movie is based on the novelette [[ASIN:0765318741 I Am Legend]]<br />Recommended for fans of Will Smith, and science fiction (Note:  I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the story follows the book.)<br /><br />Gunner  October, 2008
0143143492|5.0|This book holds all the necessary pointers that can lead to bliss in the moment.  Nomatter what circumstance you are in - there can be peace and bliss.  I have been studying meditation for the last 1 and 1/2 years in Thailand and have had the good fortune to meet 3 people who I consider to be enlightened.  I have never met Eckhart Tolle but I can tell from his teaching that he is the real deal.  His words have helped me make stay in the moment and remain as THE MOMENT - as my pure consciousness in bliss and in God even more than all the meditating and all the work I've done in Thailand and before that.  It is truly the best book I have ever read.  I only think that many will not fully grasp the depth of what he is talking about.  If you learn anything - that is to say - concepts... then that's not it.  Just always being present is it... Not having your attention soaked up into thoughts that seem so very important... or emotions that seem true and justified...   I love religions myself and all they have to give to spirituality.  I know that love of God can destroy the ego more quickly than almost anything...  Christians have great love of God!  But unfortunately - a lot of the time they get every iota of their love for God from hating other religions.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is very effective.  I am a person that is fit and exercises almost every day.  I have been using this DVD for about 4 weeks just 3 times a week and have seen improvements in my body.  It is suggested to use everyday, but if you are just maintaining you body weight 3/wk is good.  I love the short time frame of the workout.  Even if you are busy, you can fit it in.  Jillian is to the point, but not annoying.  She is much nicer on the DVD than on the biggest loser.

1400077915|5.0|This is more of a testimony than a review.  A friend of mine loaned me this book several months ago, and it went into a pile of papers on my desk and I promptly forgot about it.  When I discovered it last week, I was blown away, and had to call my friend to thank them... but not until I ordered my own copy.  While reading the first story in this collection, I realized how rare it is that a short story sorta works miracles in your head.  How a good writer can somehow pack pages of understanding into a couple of lines.  I will never forget the first time I read short-stories by such writers.  Raymond Carver is one. Flannery O'Conner another. And definitely Alice Munro.  Speaking from experience, Runaway makes for a great introduction to Munro's writing.  But there is a lot more out there, and I'm off to read it!
B000OYC3J8|1.0|I remember when this album was being recorded and they put a clip online of them recording \\"i'm slowly turning into you\\", which i thought was a great song and made me really excited about the album coming out. When it came out, i bought it, listened to it twice and was totally disappointed by it.    Today, a year and a bit after listening to it i thought i'd pull it out and listen to it again. My views haven't changed much since then, i still think it's a dull, uninspired affair, but i think if you took off \\"conquest\\", \\"prickly thorn\\", \\"st. andrew\\" and \\"rag and bone\\" (throwaway tracks in my opinion) and put better tracks in their place, the album wouldn't be as bad. Yes, there are afew good moments, but all up it's a pretty meh thing which is like a step back for them.     I still think Get Behind Me Satan is their best. While maybe one or two of the songs on GBMS is disposable, most of icky thump is disposable, and only \\"300mph torrential outpour blues\\", \\"little cream soda\\", \\"slowly turning into you\\" and \\"martyr for my love for you\\" are salvageable from the messy dullness and fit in the same level of compositional and performance quality (not so much technical skill as energy and emotion) of Get Behind Me Satan.     The album also sounds rushed, like they didn't have time to even finish writing the songs (despite the fact that the press release said \\"this was the longest time the white stripes ever spent recording an album\\") white blood cells, which was recorded in 3 days still has more cohesion and awesome songs than this, despite the fact that most of the songs WERE unfinished (or barely finished - i remember reading that Meg didn't feel as though they should have recorded WBC so soon after writing the tracks with barely any time to practice or fix them) and for icky thump they just pulled out some riffs and melody lines that they had used before. The second track has snatches of melody line from \\"i'm lonely but i ain't that lonely yet\\" and sounds like a ripoff of both \\"dead leaves and the dirty ground\\" and \\"there's no home for you here\\". I found that especially irritating.     I think Jack White has lost abit of that songwriting magic that made the white stripes good. Hopefully their next album won't be this bad.    to summarise icky thump:  4 really bad tracks which they should have replaced  5 uninspired meh tracks with not much going for them  4 white stripes quality tracks, up there with GBMS or elephant.
B001CZJKS0|1.0|Another release of Halloween? Is Anchor Bay going bankrupt or something? What's the point of this? How many more releases of this movie do we need? Please, stop the insanity, and money grubbing.
B00004ZD69|5.0|In the darkening mood of the 1990s, Canada's Godspeed You Black Emperor became the most out-there voice in the music world with their combination of radical political narratives and music capable of burning the heart of a listener like nobody ever had before.<br /><br />Whereas bands like Slint, Bark Psychosis and Don Cabellero had founded the quiet-to-loud dynamics that permitted post-rock to move \\"popular\\" music to the depth of the heart like it had never been before, Godspeed You Black Emperor added string and horn sections to an already multilayered guitar attack (three guitars) to create pieces that were so much born of teamwork that few of the identities of band members were ever revealed.<br /><br />The way in which the drums and percussion fire when the band does move into kickdown is quite incredible, giving the opening and best track \\"Storm\\", the status of being perhaps the most emotional track ever known to rock music. The passion that oozes from even the quietest parts of the song is enough for a definite recommendation: in a part around the nine-minute mark in particular, the emotion of the guitars alone beats anything heavy metal or punk could ever achieve by thrashing and reminds one of Sofia Gubaidulina's masterpiece [[ASIN:B00000149W In Croce]]. When \\"Storm\\" moves onto dense drumbeats, the emotional energy and anger it seethes is greater yet. Moreover, if one listens carefully, one realises with what passion every member of Godspeed You Black Emperor plays with, notably on the violin solo around thirteen minutes in. The loudest drum rhythms are literally martial in tone but it is the endless energy of the piece that makes \\"Storm\\" an absolute landmark for epic rock pieces that nobody before it had ever came close to. The slow piano at the end seems anticlimactic but the way in which the background noises are put into the song show the band is not lightening up.<br /><br />\\"Static\\", the other track on the first disc, opens with an electronic ticking rhythm (hence the title, one imagines) before a narrative sounding like a preacher that becomes passionately tearful as it fades out. The buzzing rhythm is then joined by violin and viola to create a hypnotic effect likened to 1970s krautrock. When the percussion kicks in, however, it gets very fast even over another violin solo. The way Sophie Trudeau's violin solos over intense and visceral guitars around fifteen minutes in is a remarkable feat that should be heard even if you have no time to sit through the whole piece - then, a piercing guitar solo turns \\"Static\\" for a few fleeting seconds into the most furious flow of energy that could ever be imagined. The last part, as with \\"Storm\\", is a kind of anti-climax with strings and synthesisers dominating.<br /><br />\\"Sleep\\" begins with an old man speaking about Coney Island and then moves onto a very simple guitar line that, though played on an electric, is very remiscent of the acoustic parts of [[ASIN:B0000019HU Spiderland]]. When the full band enters, the strings are quite piercing yet make for a remarkably tuneful, even beautiful passage around eight minutes in. The ferocious attack of three guitars and two basses, however, takes over in the next part around ten minutes in without the song's beauty disappearing. The next part is even more piercing than similar parts of \\"Static\\", but the latter half of \\"Sleep\\" is again very like [[ASIN:B0000019HU Spiderland]] in its intense guitar work.<br /><br />\\"Antennas to Heaven\\" begins with a simple folk song whose lightness adds a contrast to the band's work before the fierce guitars and strings return. The sound of a child gently singing is a second prelude, for the louder bits of this piece, if still quieter than the other three, are still deep and passionate like almost no other band has ever been, rounding off one of the most remarkable recordings in rock history.<br /><br />With its remarkable changes of mood, tempo and texture infused with a level of emotion that canonly be described as overheat, \\"Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven\\" stands as one of the greatest albums made in the 31 years since I was born. Even if it is too much to sit through each piece in one sitting, just seeing the intensity with which every member plays is enough to make your heart feel so deeply. The narratives, as on all Godspeed You Black Emperor albums, add yet another dimension to a unique and truly great group.Fists Like Antennas to Heaven\\" stands as one of the greatest albums made in the 31 years since I was born.

B000B5XOSO|4.0|After the huge success of the first Batman film in 1989, Burton was given full reign with this beautifully grotesque sequel. Forget Batman Mythology as this film bares little resemblance to the comic books we read as kids. This is Burton's fantasy this time and anything goes! If you're open minded, you should like this film as much as I did, it took balls to make a film like this and I admire that!<br /><br />One major improvement was not having Kim Basinger return, because it's the relationship between Batman and Catwoman(played deliciously by Michelle Pfeiffer)that is one of the reasons this film is better the first one. Tim Burton's visual style is all over this movie and it looks like a precursor to his animated classic 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'.<br /><br />Gotham City has a new look in this film which reminded me of the classic 'Metropolis'. This is not a kid's movie, but it does have an absurdity that only adult kids may enjoy. If you accept this as Burton's Batman you will accept the incredible ugly and disgusting Penguin that Burton dreamed up for this sequel. It's not pretty and DeVito gives an unforgettable performance.<br /><br />Over all this film still has the campy-ness of the TV show, but done with Burton's wicked dark style. I would have loved to see what he would have done with Part 3!...it's a shame, we'll never know. The 2 disc DVD set has a great transfer and some interesting Batgoodies for fans. This one edges out the first by a nose......a long Penguin nose! :-)
0743289692|5.0|I am certainly not one to gush over books. Authors are human, and write from their own biased perspectives. But every so often a book comes along that gives my own biased perspective a nice swift kick, and that definitely applies here. When it comes to religious beliefs and practices, I confess that I am one of those civilized types that gives every organized religion the benefit of the doubt.  Or, I should say, I WAS one of those types until I read this amazing and thoroughly chilling tale. Ms. Ali, thank you for \\"opening a vein\\" and bleeding your story onto paper for us...I can only imagine what it has cost you.
B001G52F2E|5.0|This is the only TV series out there that entertains with both horror and heart at the same time. It's a gore fest almost every week with a high body count, but the brothers Winchester's tortured co-dependent relationship is what will keep people addicted and coming back for more every week. Laugh and cry with the Winchester boys as they speed down the highway to meet their destiny. Season four is the best yet.
B001GATF7M|5.0|This deservedly acclaimed cult classic may be the eeriest, most compelling and most unforgettable horror movie of all time.    The camera work is beautiful. The organ music, creepy carnival and director Herk Harvey as the figure of Death are all masterpieces of each actors work.  On watching the film I was captivated and fascinated and ultimately at the film's conclusion had a strange feeling of déjà vu.    Several fantastic scenes exist in this film including the scene where Mary (Candace Hilligoss) goes to the abandoned carnival during the day.  The scene takes on a dreamlike feel.  The film's unforgettable imagery make it such a haunting experience.  The film is also notable for having a clear influence on films and filmmakers like George A Romero's classic \\"Night Of The Living Dead\\" (another 60s b/w horror classic) and David Lynch. Be warned however, once you experience the dreamlike qualities of this eerie masterpiece, I can't guarantee you'll ever awake from it.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This 1970's documentary is a great classic. Great footage and editorial comment by a number of historians as well as the combatants from all sides of the conflict. While this British produced piece shows a lot from the Anglo perspective, it really does have a good balance covering the war in it's entire scope. If you like a flag flying, victory by sheer might type of story, this is probably NOT the documentary for you.<br />If you want to get the \\"feel\\" of the war from the London blitz to the siege of Stalingrad to the beaches of the Pacific, you'll like this terrific classic piece.
630469797X|5.0|Not only is DOTD the greasted Zombie film, ever, bar none, it may be one of the greatest horror films, and is good enough to stand up to other great films of ANY genre.    Modern day critics have blasted the '70's soundtrack, FX, and shambling, seemingly harmless Zombies.  As to the '70's, it was made in the '70's, which was a seminal time for Horror.  Those slow moving Zombies may seem harmless, but they are relentless-Let your guard down for a second, You're toast.  I think Romero was deliberate in this, as in some scenes, after the Mall is secured, you forget all about them, yet they are still outside, mindlessly and patiently waiting for their chance to get back in.  Fast moving Zombies will never have the same menace.    The script is a good one, with fine performances by it's four lead actors, but Ken Foree is the heart and soul of the film.   The scene where he confronts Stephen (Flyboy) with a loaded weapon is simply brilliant, as is  the nightmarish scene in the basement of the Tenement where he dispatches the undead.    The gore-Yes it shows it's age, but it's still painfully cringe-inducing.    The Humour-Bikers versus Zombies in a pie fight.  Ludicrous, yet it cuts the unbelievably tense atsmophere, sort of like Craven did in \\"Last house on the Left\\".  A welcome respite.    Overall, very strong writing, direction, and acting.  The relationships the protagonist develop are quite believable and complex, and when two of them meet their demise, it is very emotional.    An incredible classic, depressing, funny, tense, and thought provoking film.  Totally worth the price.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Finally after years of dissapointment with their change in the style of music they were putting out Bob Rock is gone!!! Long live Rick Rubin. Metallica is back with a vengence. This is the best music they've put out since ... And Justice For All and is one of my favorite Metallica discs of all time.Let's hope they will stay in this direction from now on.If you are hesitating to pick up this disc don't. If you like old school Metallica this is the one you've been waiting for.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|This album is just crushingly brilliant and incredible. I swear, Origin are such an awesome technical death metal band that can play at such sick, wicked, blinding speeds that are extremely hard to comprehend. &#34;Antithesis&#34; is a lightning fast, speaker shredding, eye popping, ear shredding, dive bombing, brutal technical death metal thrillride that will take you on an insane, out of this world ride that you'll never ever forget. I got this album over the summer, and it definitely won me over big time, and it's definitely a masterpiece at that. This is also one of the best extreme death metal releases of 2008 that I've had the pleasure of listening to as well. The production on this album is excellent, and the musicianship on here is absolutely superb throughout, and the band is definitely firing on all cylinders, and this album proves exactly that. James Lee is an awesome vocalist who has a great blend of relentless low growls and frightening high shrieks that can burst right out of the stereo speakers and grab you right by the throat. Guitarists Paul Ryan and Jeremy Turner are in top form on here. The riffs are very fast, thrashy, furious, and battering, and the sweeps are very catchy and wickedly jaw dropping, and yes there are also solos, and memorable ones indeed too. Mike Flores's bass work is just jaw dropping and sick, and he has some great lines and some cool sweeps of his own on here. Drummer John Longstreth is just an absolute animal, as he blasts and barrages his way throughout with rapid-fire, neck snapping blast beats. He also does some great time signature changes as well, and he does an excellent job with the double bass too. The opening track &#34;The Aftermath&#34; (My favorite song, and the reason I bought this CD) immediately without warning gets the album roaring with mad dive bombing riffs and wild blasting blasts beats, and relentless, barraging vocals. I love the lightning fast guitar sweeps that are indeed addicting, and there's also a fantastic solo as well. Actually there's not even one bad song on this album, they're all awesome. &#34;Algorihm&#34; is another blasting bruiser that mercilessly starts off with more of John's insane perfectly timed and propelled skin blasting, and violent, unrelenting, scorching riffs by Paul and Jeremy. &#34;Consuming Misery&#34; is highlighted by loud, heavy, scorching, battering riffage, and a couple of pounding, marching double bass drum sections. Track four &#34;Wrath of Vishnu&#34; is another favorite song on here that quickly begins with quick battering, machine gun like riffs and more neck snapping skin blasts, which are soon followed by James's insanely, frightening vocals, and at 1:16 there's an epic middle-eastern influenced riff that is just timeless and majestic, and there's also another fantastic guitar solo as well. &#34;Finite&#34; is another highlight which features an addicting hyperspeed opening lead riff, and there's a great guitar sweep section at 1:35 as well, and the ending is great too. &#34;The Beyond Within&#34; is highlighted by more mean intense riffs and ear shredding leads, and more amazing sweeps, and intense vocals from James. The closing title track &#34;Antithesis&#34; is the longest song on the album clocking in at 9:32, and it literally erupts from the depths and pummels your brain senseless, and there's also and awesome lengthy, spiraling guitar solo at 7:21. An awesome song this truly is, I love it. Please read on for the song ratings.<br /><br />Jeremy's song ratings:<br />1. The Aftermath (4:34) - 5/5 My favorite song<br />2. Algorithm (3:31) - 5/5<br />3. Consuming Misery (3:56) - 5/5<br />4. Wrath of Vishnu (4:43) - 5/5<br />5. Finite (3:08) - 5/5<br />6. The Apalling (2:54) - 5/5<br />7. Void (0:39) - 4/5<br />8. Ubiquitous (5:33) - 5/5<br />9. The Beyond Within (3:20) - 5/5<br />10. Antithesis (9:32) - 5/5<br /><br />I definitely must say that after listening to &#34;Antithesis&#34;, I definitely have to say that this is truly one of the best extreme death metal albums of 2008 hands down, and it also proves the Origin are indeed at the top of their game and they're better than ever before. Overall, if you're a serious death metal fan like myself, then &#34;Antithesis&#34; is an album that should NEVER be ignored whatsoever, it's that good believe me. Buy this album now, and brace yourself for one serious thrillride. Enjoy!!!and it also proves the Origin are indeed at the top of their game and they're better than ever before.

B001DDBCUK|5.0|I rented this movie, much to the utter chagrin of my boyfriend, without ever having seen the TV show.  But, despite being wary about it, I have to say that I was totally captivated. It's a really long movie, about 2 and a half hours, but it didn't seem like it. Things progressed at a decent pace and was very interesting. I didn't find myself bored for one minute. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised that I fell in love with this movie and the characters.
0553582461|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and by far her best one of the two trilogies (Fareer & Tawny Man). It was kind of a bittersweet when I finished this because in a way, I didnt want it to end. Compared to her other books, this has a faster pace and a bigger plot than the first two of the series. Almost everything is nicely tied together in this finale. Unlike the other books, this one has constant action that will keep you readin into the wee hours of the morning.

B000V86OKG|5.0|You probably wouldn't be reading this if you hadn't already seen the first season of DEXTER, the one that introduces us to this unique serial killer and blood splatter forensics expert, the destroyer of destroyers, and a guy trying to figure out how to live with his dark passenger--his terrible sociopathic need to kill.<br /><br />While the first season focused on the search for and relationship of Dexter to the Ice Truck Killer, the second season takes us into Dexter's crisis of identity, and the noose narrowing about his neck as his cache of victims (underwater in the Atlantic) is retrieved and analyzed and start pointing uncomfortably close. His antagonist, Sgt Doakes, gets off, then back on Dexter's case. It will begin a showdown of significance. We learn more about some of the characters, including Dexter's foster dad, and his sister Deb gets to have (another) romance. Not a serial killer this time.<br /><br />Dexter also develops a new relationship with a woman who has an affinity for things dark and dangerous. Is she his soulmate? The consequences of this relationship ripple into the lives of Dexter's loved ones, including Rita and her kids.<br /><br />Keith Carradine comes into the cast as an FBI expert on serial killers, one with a bit of a zen vibe. He's excellent in his (temporary?) role.<br /><br />Wonderful plotting, terrific acting, excellent dialogue, and well-rounded characterization make for a quality series that doesn't droop or disappoint in its second season.<br /><br />Now, I gotta see Season Three. Whoo!<br /><br />Mir
B000OCZD5G|5.0|The Road Warrior is one of those rare beasts. A sequel that surpasses the original. There are many things that make this movie great. It's a post apocalyptic western. The hero barely speaks throughout the film. The excellent chase scene in the last half hour. The brilliant stunts. The dialogue. The tension of not knowing what will happen next. And a great set of bad guys. The list goes on and on. And thankfully it transfers on to blu-ray exceptionally well. I spotted all kinds of things I'd never noticed before and I've seen this film plenty.  Really worth buying on blu-ray.
0441009425|2.0|The first 330 pages of this 581-page tome were a chore to push through.  The pacing was poor, and the storyline advanced glacially.  Finally, as I was on the verge of giving up, the story hooked me enough to push through to the end, but the final 100 pages were disappointing, too.  As an earlier reviewer remarked, what this book needed more than anything else was an editor.  Reynolds' publisher seems to have been surprisingly indulgent with a first-time author.  There are ideas enough for a decent 300-page novel here, but: there's too much extraneous action and unnecessary dialog; the characters are poorly drawn; explanations are witheld for the sake of drama, but at the expense of coherence; and Reynolds aspires to literary heights of prose that, frankly, are beyond his skill, giving the whole book a pretentious air.  After reading REVELATION SPACE, I can't say I'm in a hurry to read any of Reynolds' subsequent works.  Skillful editing would have made for a much tighter, better story.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|...wait, wasn't that Sliders?  Okay, not exactly the same, but comparing those two is a good way to show everything that was wrong with Jumper.<br /><br />The concept is fine, but the execution was sorely lacking.  There's no character development because so much time is covered over the course of the movie.  We get no insight into the main character's thoughts, motivations, or personality.  He comes off as shallow and two-dimensional.  He goes from scared kid to conscienceless, arrogant jerk in ten minutes.  There's never any question or delving into whether what he's doing is right or wrong (he's a thief, plain and simple) or how he could use his power for good instead of just wasting it.  Granted, who wouldn't want to gallivant about the world, carefree, I suppose, but the moral struggle would be very much a part of the character.<br /><br />Unlike in Sliders, the Jumpers have full control over where they go and when.  Still, the TV show format of one or two jumps and an adventure per show would be far more entertaining than this jumbled, boring, barely explained plotline.  Then again, this would require character development and plot.<br /><br />Even the pivotal plot point about the secret organization is boring, focusing on a religious inquisition instead of, oh, upholding the law.  Of all the trite and cheesy story lines (scientific experiments, military uses, etc) this is not only the tritest and cheesiest, but also the most yawn-inducing.<br /><br />Even as a mindless action movie this one fails, unless your aim is to become a brain-dead zombie.  The greatest part of this movie was the end, simply because it meant it was over.  A huge disappointment, because there were so many elements (his mother, for one) which could have been interesting if they'd done more than scratch the surface.
B000J5NXLY|1.0|This is an accurate meter that is fairly easy to use. I took reflected light readings off the ground and the subject for my of my shots and was never disappointed.    Then, the meter broke. Actually, the red needle that gives the light readings became dislodged from its control mechanism. It now moves freely inside of the plastic enclosure making readings impossible. Unfortunately, the meter isn't designed to be user-servicable. If it had, I would remove the plastic and re-attach it. I bought the meter because I didn't need features that more modern meters would provide, but I didn't realize that I would be sacrificing durability. Avoid this meter if you think it might be subjected to the slightest amount of abuse.

B0018AK9RA|4.0|I am a Priest fan since 1977, roughly.  The first album by them I owned was Hell Bent for Leather, which, strangely, Nostradamus reminds me of HBFL.  It has the variety that was on Hell Bent.  Remember how you felt the first time you heard \\"Before the Dawn\\", it was like what was that?  It seemed so out of place.  Nostradamus has alot of slow little pre-songs, I guess you could call them.  I like that Priest took a chance with this album, I would love to say it is the album of the year or the decade, but it isn't.  It is good.  It's hit and miss, and sometimes it seems to drag on far beyond the listener's attention span.  On the other hand, I find it hard to pinpoint a critical downfall.  I think it's a good, solid album that, especially for a veteran band like Priest, really takes a chance that their fans will purchase it without ever hearing it on the radio.  It is not a very radio friendly album, which I like.  The bottom line, I think, for Priest fans, will be it was a hit and miss album where the band attempted to go beyond what was expected, and sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed.  Nostradamus is solid, though, and belongs as an important part of the Priest catalog.  It's way, way better than Turbo!  If they failed on this album it certainly wasn't because they were trying to be commercial, sometimes the songs seem to suffer from length, or repetition.  It actually can be a somewhat boring, lugubrious listen, but it also has some absolutely great moments, and sounds new and classic at the same time.
B00004YA66|4.0|After watching this movie several time for the past years on VHS , i<br />decided to get the DVD, why ???  because this movie is very very good.<br />The music, the mood, the acting,,,,the STORY....WOW.<br />All involved with this movie, actors, directors did a great job.<br />I just finished watching the DVD and the impact is as strong as the first<br />time. A keeper for sure.
B000Y7U98C|1.0|A good director with a good cast can take even a bad story and make a decent film.  This movie had a wonderful cast and the story was original.  This movie was marketed as a scifi thriller and I believe the screenplay was probably good.  The first thirty minutes of the movie lived up to its expectations.  However the movie quickly degenerated into a B slasher movie courtesy of Director Danny Boyle.  Danny Boyle took what could have been a good movie and ruined it.  Despite his critical acclaim he has never done anything original.  28 Days Later and its sequel were just variations of dawn of the dead.  This movie is no different.  It is almost exactly like the 1997 movie \\"Event Horizon\\".  This movie would have been so much better without the shaky camera angles and extreme close ups that made the action sequences impossible to follow.  A good director can build suspense and thrill you without using hokey camera tricks and gore.  Put this one in the category of \\"Had great potential\\" and dont waste your time.
B000BPG2JC|4.0|The tale is well written the descriptions of the scenes make it perfectly clear the view site inside my imagination!  I only say that the motive of the crime and sex of the perpetrator is known after the page 200 or so, then the suspect list drops a lot, It trys later to mix the mind but there is no way. the real killer is only known at the lasts 30 pages.  Excelent reading!!
B0010X745K|1.0|It seems the writer intended this movie to be a sort of morality tale about the frailty of humanity and the depths to which people will sink in the face of fear and the unknown. He failed miserably. The characters are unrealistic archetype caricatures, all of which are unbelievably stupid and slow to act in the diferent situations that arise in the movie. Apparently the only archetype not represented is that of rational humane man. Everyone's first instinct is to either kill someone else or start offing themselves like lemmings. This was a terrible movie. Do not waste your time.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|My wife was a Speed Racer fan as a kid; she insisted on going to see this movie with me. I, having remembered MY experiences watching the original, agreed but recognized this as being one of those things a husband must do.<br /><br />I have never been more fortunately wrong.<br /><br />Speed Racer is not just a cartoon being brought to life. It's a story of a family, told with artistry drawn from the anime subgenre and with storytelling methods from all the eras of movies ever made. The sad thing is that this movie may make money, but it's almost dead-certain that the achievements involved in making it won't be really recognized... because it is, after all, \\"Speed Racer!\\"<br /><br />What this movie does... is nothing short of magical. We are introduced to a world in which colors are brighter, where the 1960s meet the Bright Shining Future!!! envisioned in the 1940s, where -- it seems -- extreme auto racing has replaced not merely other sports, but even warfare. Corporations control almost every aspect of the sport, and the battle for supremacy on the track is echoed by the battles in the boardroom... or does the racing echo the boardroom?<br /><br />It focuses on a family -- a startlingly well-adjusted, coherent, loving family, one of VERY few found in American cinema where usually families are fragmented, shattered, traumatized, and dysfunctional; overall, I can only think of a couple of other really overall \\"together\\" families in cinema -- and one of them is the Addams Family.<br /><br />The Racer family LIVES auto racing -- racing at a level that normally is reserved for jet fighter pilots, on tracks that combine military-level equipment and Department of Transportation highway construction with roller-coaster design sensibilities and with cars that may exceed 800 kilometers per hour (500mph), cars sometimes armed and always with little surprising gadgets hidden away. The family does have an old tragedy in the background, but the focus of the family is on their racing -- building the cars, racing them, and keeping it a family business.<br /><br />As one can predict, the family business and the huge corporations are destined to clash -- violently.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into the details of the plot; it's not necessary. What's important is to know that the background is introduced seamlessly; you come to know this strange world, this unusual family, the power of the corporations, the sport that is central to the action, and all the conflicts that will emerge, in visual and dialogue sequences that interweave and lead into each other perfectly -- you ask a question, it is answered at exactly the right time, to produce exactly the right effect.<br /><br />Not everyone will like this movie. But for those who can, it is perfect. I cannot think of a single aspect of Speed Racer that could be changed without lessening it -- and I don't think there is another movie I can think of about which I could say that. The Wachowskis set out to distill the essence of what made that silly cartoon somehow appealing to a group of fans even over a period of 40 years... and they succeeded., and keeping it a family business.

B00005QBUK|5.0|I have spent hundreds of dollars searching for a headset that stays in my ear AND doesn't hurt.  Most are too large, apparently I have a very small ear. The ones that have the 'eyeglass' type and hang on your ear?  Well apparently my lobes aren't high enough to hold those on.  I know it sounds like I'm some kind of earless freak, part bird or some such, but only these verticles stay on my head, in my ear and don't cause me any pain.
B000P0I4O4|2.0|A waste of a four-star cast - total lethargy from beginning to end. The script is uninspired, the acting is so-so (clearly, there was no enthusiasm for this project), the plot meanders, and an almost random choice of sub-plot promises little...and then delivers even less. Every component of this film is lacking, right down to the frequent humorless exchanges inserted presumably by some quack of a script doctor. We didn't even get to see the right wing extremist offed at the end. That, at least, would have perked me up after this positive yawn of a movie.
0811806405|4.0|You can learn to build a guitar from many books written<br />by fine, talented builders.<br /><br />This book is beyond a mere technical explanation of how<br />to put the parts together - it's a treatise in which is<br />buried the HOW to think like a guitar builder and grow<br />to have a control of the countless variables which contribute<br />to a great guitar.<br /><br />I don't personally build with the method described here -<br />but I used it in combination with other methods I<br />leaned from other sources.  This book was always open on<br />my bench in my early days of building guitars.<br /><br />The book doesn't cover go-bar or vaccuum clamping technologies,<br />the Fox side bender, hollow-dishing forms, nor the numerous<br />small specialized tools now available.  You can get the LMI<br />handbook/catalog for that information.<br /><br />The authors' explanation of how to shape the neck is<br />thoughtful as is the reasoning behind every process taught.<br />They don't advocate building complex molds and I would tend<br />to agree - because making hard molds is an awful lot of<br />work and it's a crutch for the unconfidant builder.<br /><br />In the end, your first guitar is a learning experience.<br />You can't really screw it up except by not persevering<br />and finishing the project.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|after having watched this whole season, i have really lost interest in my original reason to watch the program to begin with...all we do is chase that demon!  originally, this series dealt with all kinds of supernatural phenomenon and now only focuses on Dean ultimate demise (and resurection) and the demons that were unleashed. i am very disappointed and wish they would go back to expunging other supernatural entities and not stay chasing demons!!! oh, jerad and jensen are still HOT along with that car Dean drives!

0765340798|1.0|This was a VERY difficult book for me to read.  I tried many times to focus and get into the story, but the poor job of storytelling made this impossible.  The plot was not cohesive at all.  It jumped all over the place making the story very unpolished and uncomfortable to read. Sadly, when compared to its predecessors, this book was not a huge disappointment - it simply continues the trend of bad writing.  Please do not waste your time with this one.
B000EGCITG|4.0|I purchased the CD because I love the song \\"Who Knew.\\"  There are a few other good songs on the CD, but I especially like the last cut.  It's an acoustic guitar version of a song that she performs with a dad. Full of harmony. Beautiful.   I also received it right on time.    The only concern I have - and this is not about the CD per se, is that whenever I order  CDs on line by Amazon, I get numerous e-mails written in other languages, other alphabets, some of which contain potential viruses.

B000GCFO0I|5.0|Usually I agree with the overall Amazon reviews--but not on this one! I found that there is plenty of plot in Silent Hill. Its atmospheric, creepy, edge-of-your-seat presentation is nothing short of spectacular in the realm of horror flicks. C'mon now, the people giving this movie bad reviews must not be watching much of the rubbish that Hollywood has been sending down the pipe in the way of spooky movies. Silent Hill is far above most of them. I honestly didn't even want to like it going into it...but man, I sure was pleasantly surprised. By the time the movie was over, I felt like I had just come off of a wild rollercoaster ride! I was drained, weak, and mind-boggled. This movie rocks!
B00005A1VH|5.0|This film begins in the Cumberland Valley of Tennessee. It shows some men on horses shooting revolvers. The rest of the film shows York never owning an expensive horse or revolver! People are singing in a chapel. There are scenes of country life in those backwoods, a hard life for many. There is entertainment in a rural tavern. The pastor warns Alvin York against his crooked path. Do the wealthy look down on the poor? Alvin makes a down payment on that bottom land. Men go around armed. Alvin works hard to earn the rest of the money. Alvin plans to win the shooting match and win the big prize. Percussion cap muzzle loaders are used. Pastor Pyle counsels Alvin against his anger. But Alvin sulks. Riding on a stormy night a flash of lightning gives a warning. Alvin gets religion. The lost sheep is found and rescued. Alvin becomes a teacher of religion. He doesn't want to become a soldier who kills; its against the Book. \\"I'll be coming back.\\"    Private York shows his shooting skills with a modern Springfield rifle. They want him as an instructor to teach the recruits how to shoot. A book teaches Alvin American history. Corporal York will train the soldiers, then they are sent to France and the trenches. In October 1918 the American troops are sent to attack the Germans across the open fields. Machine guns open fire, they take cover in shell holes. The captain orders a flanking attack. York neutralizes the machine gun nests. The Germans surrender to York and the other men. The German officer orders his men to surrender, their war is over. York and seven others captured 132 prisoners. The Good Lord protected him, York killed to save lives. The many medals recognized the heroism of Sergeant York. He was given the key to New York city. York rejects show business and returns home to his family. The people of Tennessee donated a house and a 200 acre farm. Alvin and Gracie married and lived happily ever after. [But there was trouble with the IRS over income taxes for the giftof house and land. The people of Tennessee were not oppressed by \\"gun control\\" or this story would be different.]    This movie was intended to prepare America for another war to end war. WW II made America the world's superpower with the decline of European powers and their colonial possessions. Imperial Germany had exhausted itself by 1918. Mutinies and revolutions were breaking out. The November 1918 truce allowed the German government to stay in power (and prepare for the next war). This mistake was not repeated after the next war. The writers on this film were Howard Koch (\\"Casablanca\\") and John Huston (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\").
B0002IVN9W|4.0|It's tough to say anything about this record that hasn't already been said in a hundred other reviews. Nonetheless, it never hurts to try. On their debut LP Funeral, Arcade Fire sound fresh, invigorated, and confident. The band stylistically apes a number of great classic artists, not to mention some much more modern ones. Their style of pairing upbeat melodies with dark, brooding lyrics is taken directly from contemporaries Of Montreal, who have been writing quirky, downtrodden pop songs for years. What sets Arcade Fire apart from many indie bands doing a similar sort of thing, such as the Besnard Lakes, is their taste for production and songwriting, which really can't be matched by their direct competitors. The songs are lively and passionate, though often enough they stray and overstay their welcome. Seven out of ten tracks on this record clock in near or over five minutes when many of them would have been tighter and more enjoyable at four.<br /><br />Songs such as opener \\"Tunnels\\" and track three \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" have bright and creative instrumentation, though Arcade Fire is hardly the first band to get so creative in their use of older 'uncool' instruments. The Decemberists have been using things like glockenspiel and lap steel since their first EP. At the end of the day, Funeral is a spry and enjoyable debut, but like many good things, it gets a little more credit than it is due, resulting in the polarization of rabid fans and detractors, leaving little room for casual fans to have any say about the band. Funeral is a great record, but it isn't life-changing or future-forging the way many critics say, but songs like \\"Power Out\\" will leave little doubt as to whether or not this album is worth the dough.

0316067601|1.0|A fellow reviewers comment \\"Not due to any thrilling narrative but due entirely to the extreme jingoism of the author\\" pretty much sums up this book for me. I'd heard about the publication of the book on NPR, was looking forward to reading it but gave up after about 80 pages mostly because of the authors endlessly jingoistic tone. I found it a total distraction to what is probably an excellent story. I just finished reading \\"Highway To Hell\\" by ex British SAS solder John Geddes and was struck by the difference in how these two authors view the Middle East, it's people and the \\"war on terror\\".

B001E5FYS8|5.0|I saw this movie in a local theater about a month ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  It's a good, well constructed documentary film that uses some recreated scenes as well as current interviews and period film and photos.  The story of how Phillipe Petit planned and executed a tightrope walk between the twin towers is laid bare.  1350 feet in the air, 200 feet across.  It was hard to believe even as I watched it.  It seemed inspiring and insane all at once.  I don't know if he's courageous or crazy but I suspect the answer is both.<br /><br />If this movie sounds the least bit interesting to you, go ahead and get it.  You won't be disappointed.  If I hadn't seen it on the last night of it's run at the theater I might have gone more than once.

He's a real zen-master of a dog, providing some excellent advice for all--as well as enough laughs and tears to use up a box or so of tissues--throughout this thoroughly enjoyable book by Garth Stein.<br /><br />There are a few places where you'll have to suspend disbelief but, remember, this is a novel and not reality. The gods grant fiction writers a little leeway in that respect, no matter what critics may say.<br /><br />No need for me to get into the plot. Others here have already outlined that and it appears a majority agree Enzo is one of the most charming characters and this is one of the most pleasant reads to come along in recent years.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|Rachael Yamagata is one of those artists it's okay to fall asleep to while listening to her music. Not because it's boring (unless you incorrectly equate \\"slow\\" with \\"boring\\"); her songwriting is comforting, careful and intimate - and her voice matches these qualities perfectly. In fact, her vocals are more consistent and maybe even more mature this time around. It's been four years since Happenstance (her first studio album) and her songwriting has seemed to find a balance between soft pop-rock (and I use all three terms very loosely) and even softer, richer lullabies (I'm thinking of \\"Meet Me By the Water\\" from Happenstance and \\"Over and Over\\" from Elephants...). That being said, Rachael is definitely not the artist to listen to while you're driving down the freeway (at least not in my 2000 Saturn that rattles); she was amazing live in Seattle (at a small venue off Madison called Chop Suey) and amazingly, she sounds just as personal and incredible with earbuds. Her melodies are just as beautiful, brilliant and inspiring as her first album and EPs, though perhaps not as experimental (as \\"Collide\\" or \\"Under My Skin\\"). I think the highlights are \\"Sidedish Friend\\", \\"What If I Leave\\", \\"Pause The Tragic Ending\\" and \\"Sunday Afternoon\\". Rachael could stop creating new music today and I would still think she contributed something truly unique and heartfelt to the musical canon, but of course, I hope she releases many, many more albums.
B001CLG6RC|2.0|I have been a passionate fan of Enigma since their 1990 debut \\"MCMXC a.D.\\"  Their follow up, \\"The Cross of Changes,\\" was admirable.  But Enigma became a force to be reckoned with, as demonstrated by their breathtaking, powerhouse 1996 album \\"Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!\\" (\\"The King is Dead, Long Live the King!\\").  The subsequent three albums have had their moments, but Enigma has yet to top \\"Le Roi...\\"      With the release of their seventh album, \\"Seven Lives Many Faces,\\" Enigma has hit a new low.  The bulk of the album is a string of uninspired and second-rate hip hop tracks, with very little of the majesty and sweeping grandeur of the band's best work.  High points on the album include the tracks \\"La Puerta Del Cielo,\\" \\"Je T'aime Till My Dying Day,\\" and \\"Deja Vu.\\"  While these three tracks do feature the brand of emotionally lush soundscapes that Enigma is known for, on a stronger collection they would be considered weaker offerings.  The second disc of this special edition set fares worse.  Four of the five selections are, politely, mere detritus.  However, the track \\"Sunrise\\" is the clear highlight of not only the bonus disc, but also the main entree.  \\"Sunrise\\" is a beautifully poignant instrumental featuring some of the most heart-achingly beautiful song writing Enigma has featured since their 1994 song, \\"The Dream of the Dolphin.\\"  But something seemed naggingly familiar about \\"Sunrise.\\"   Then it hit me: Enigma had pretty much lifted \\"Sunrise's\\" chord progression directly from the song \\"Metamorphosis\\" by Boydstun, which was featured in the PBS miniseries \\"Cosmos\\" by Carl Sagan, the soundtrack of which was recently re-released as an extended and remastered 2-disc set.    Bottom line: I don't buy Enigma albums to listen to hip-hop.  In fact, I loathe hip-hop.  I hope the next album is a return to the beautiful and emotionally powerful sonic explorations that made me fall in love with them so many years ago.
0930289234|5.0|I had heard quite a bit of the hype for Watchmen, particularly with the movie being announced. So I finally decided to give it a shot and see if it lived up to it.<br /><br />It's so rare for any form of media to stand up to today's hype machine. Between the trailer for the movie, friends constantly talking it up, forums constantly talking it up. It's almost not fair to book, comics, games, music, etc. But this is one of the few things I've come across recently that lived up to - and shattered - all the hype. This is just plain phenomenal in every way.<br /><br />If you're a fan of comics, if you're a fan of great artwork, if you're a fan of great storytelling. You'd be doing yourself a disservice by not reading this.<br /><br />Get it! It's that simple!
B000000W5B|5.0|I am the Stones authority. And this is their most underrated outing during their peak years of 1968 through 1973. Its reputation suffers among Stones purists for two reasons - it was judge at the time in light of recent Stones history and the breath taking string of master albums that preceded it, beginning with Beggars Banquet and Let It Bleed to end the Sixties, and then Sticky Fingers and Exile On Main Street to kick off the Seventies. So what album would look impressive in this company? The second reason this album's reputation suffered with Stones purists was the radio single that became the hit representing this album. As \\"Start Me Up\\" taints Tatoo You with the Stones aficionado, so too in the minds of many Stones fans does \\"Angie\\" taint this album - which is unfortunate really, because few songs have aged as well as that single. \\"Angie\\" was the song that was popular with people who were not Stones fans - and to any purist who feels that a band belongs to them, because they love the songs that nobody knows, especially those beautiful people phonies who never loved the band, but now dance to \\"Angie\\" - well, this was more than many Stones fans could stomach and so they dismissed it outright. I was one of them. But \\"Angie\\" is a great song. I'll stack \\"Heartbreaker\\" up against \\"Brown Sugar\\" \\"Rocks Off\\" and \\"Bitch\\" any day. \\"100 Years Ago\\" is every bit as unique and wonderful as \\"Sway\\", and \\"Winter\\" is nearly as haunting and just as wonderful as \\"Moonlight Mile\\".  \\"Star, Star\\" is just flat out cool fun, and \\"Hide Your Love\\" and \\"Can You Hear The Music\\"  are the rarely traveled netherworld of rythms not seen since Our Satanic Majesties Request and not revisited again until side two of Tatoo You. It is great stuff.    For many they count this album as the beginning of the Stones Seventies glam period that finished with Emotional Rescue in 1979 and reached its peak with Some Girls in 1978. And that is true. But it is also true that this is the final movement of a stretch of creative output unrivaled in Rock history - the coda on a brilliant five album run. For me it is both, and a necessary bridge of departure from one era onward to another. And when I am sitting around with my purist Stones friends drinking and telling lies, well, we'll be listening to Exile On Main Street, because that is the proper thing to do, but when I am alone and thinking about the days of youth gone by this is the album I'll pull off the shelf and drift away to a time and place far, far away, magical, fresh and alive.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite love stories. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Kiera does an amazing job too and has become one of my favorite actress to watch. She's got a great future ahead of her. I've seen other versions of Pride and Prejudice and I think this is the best hands down!
B000000W5F|5.0|I am the Stones Authority. This album stands out like Mount Fuji or Kilimanjaro, not because they are the tallest mountains, but because there are no others around them. This still does not diminish their impressiveness. Tatoo You is that album, with only Some Girls coming close just a few years earlier, and then the void - nothing, really, until we reach Voodoo Lounge and Bridges To Babylon many, many years later. Among Stones fans there was great optimism that this album following on the slightly disappointting Emotional Rescue the follow up to the very good, if not great, Some Girls, heralded an era of creativity that would rival the run that started with Beggars Banquet and ended with Goats Head Soup. That new era would be defined by Some Girls, carried by Tatoo You, and then ... And then ... Oh well. Anyway, despite the radio single \\"Start Me Up\\" this is a first class album and from the era when albums had sides, this album had two sides. Two distinct sides, with it only getting better when you flipped the album to side two. Side one is the rock side and I give you \\"Black Limousine\\" for those Rock Blues purists, then \\"Little T&A\\" for those fun loving Rockers out there. And what the hell is wrong with \\"Hang Fire\\" or \\"Slave\\"?    But I don't really listen to side one, I listen to side two, and that is what makes this album great - the five song straight flush that opens with the amazing \\"Worried About You\\", then takes you to the \\"Tops\\" and then into \\"Heaven\\" where it is \\"No Use In Crying\\" while you are \\"Waiting On a Friend\\".    I apologize for that my friends, couldn't help myself, but it does go to prove my point that this is one of the best sides in rock and roll, of which the Stones have provided many. A must have for any serious rock and roll fan, and has to be mentioned by any serious Stones fan as evidence that the Stones remained great and relevant beyond the Sixties and Seventies.    And, you know what, if you happen to like \\"Start Me Up\\" - then I guess itis all right with me.
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|This weekend, I got this nerf \\"sniper\\" for my birthday so I can participate in my dorm's game \\"RC Assassins.\\"   All in all, if you're considering buying this, I would reccomend the [[ASIN:B000XTPOLS Nerf N-Strike Recon Cs-6 Dart Blaster]], which is $10 less, or the [[ASIN:B0002UP0IA Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Maverick]], which is $10 total.    Pros:  2 six-dart magazines for slightly faster reloading  Cons:  The gun jams too much, which ruins the darts you're given.  The detatchable pistol is terrible. You get one shot you have to load from the front when the darts are stored in the two magazines, one stored in the stock of the rifle and the other loaded in place.  Pitiful range. Box claims to be \\"the longest nerf blaster\\"-- This seems to refer to the barrel of the rifle, not the range of the dart's fire (35 feet, according to the box, but I've fired that far with one of the older nerf guns I had when I was younger and with my friends' new Mavericks).   I know there are warnings \\"Do not modify darts or dart blaster,\\" but I'm an engineering student with the help of three other engineering students, so we gave it a try. With the current design, we couldn't remove the air suppressors, but we did stretch the spring out to 1 and 1/3 times the length. It works just the same after putting it all back together, except it fires a little farther (about a foot or two). Also, it was a pain to remove the screws. Using the right sized screwdriver, almost all of the screws were stripped (cheap quality).
B000000W5H|3.0|I am the Stones Authority. This is only 3.5 stars, barely. It is not a great album. It's a great cover, but not a great album. There are a couple of songs that are some of my favorites, but only a couple. \\"Luxury\\" is my personal favorite from this album. The title song from the album is fantastic and one of the best lyrics written in rock music.  \\"Time Waits For No One\\" is not bad either. There are some other pretty good tunes, but they do not quite realize their full potential in this production. And that actually is the problem with the whole album, apart from the title song from the album \\"It's Only Rock And Roll\\", the songs on this album in few instances meet expectations. They are not bad songs, but they are just not quite there. \\"Dance Little Sister\\" does not do it for me - sorry my fellow Stones purists. \\"If You Can't Rock Me\\" is cool, but where would this song figure on a another Stones album? I do not think it would, and it is only notable here on this album because this collection is not strong. \\"Short and Curlies\\"? \\"If You Really Want to Be My Friend\\"?  Those tracks are just not doing it for me anymore than \\"Fingerprint File\\" is. Nor does \\"Till the Next Goodbye\\". These are not great songs and they go on for much too long. If you are going to bore someone, then it is a good idea to be brief about it. For an album titled \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\"  there is precious little of it to be found here. The tracks I mentioned as being strong save it from being a cellar dweller.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|OMG!!!  This is absolutely the BEST thing I've seen EVER!  I actually ran out and bought a Blu-Ray DVD player JUST FOR THIS!!  I had to!  I am a HUGE fan of Celine.  And yes, I am a guy.  I took my wife to her last concert in Boston a month or two ago and it just turned me on!  I think she is FABULOUS and this DVD showcases every inch of her OUTSTANDING TALENT.  I play guitar, have season tix to the Comcast Center, so I know a lot about music.  I can't say enough good things about it.  I run my own high tech company north of Boston and don't have a boss so I can get away with this: I took a day off last week, made a TON OF POPCORN, and WATCHED THIS DVD over and over again.  I felt like a little boy skipping school and sneaking a peek at dirty magazines.  Hee-hee!!    Seriously, buy this DVD, it's INCREDIBLE!
B000000W5N|5.0|I am the Stones authority. But I am not going to give you a blow by blow analyzing each of the tracks, many of the 4 & 5 star posters here have already made fine arguments and cases for the album and the individual tracks. My post here is to address the handful of nuts out of more than two hundred reviews here who somehow rate this album as 1 or 2 stars. The mind boggles. Even a non-fan, but someone with a general appreciation for music, should be able to walk away with at least 3 stars and respect for this album. What I am wondering about is what would rate 5 stars in the world of a reviewer who gave this album 1 star? Five stars for Babs? Bee Gees? Kiss? Ratt? Michael Bolton? Michael Jackson? Kenny G? What rates 5 stars in your world?<br /><br />Simply put this is one of two Stones albums that is arguably their best, and certainly an album that figures automatically into the top ten of any list of the best albums ever - by anyone. If you don't have it and are not familiar with it - then you have no business talking about music - with anyone. Period.
B00006AUIG|4.0|\\"Session 9\\" is a complex and very tense horror movie annex psychological drama, that will still haunt you long after it has finished, at least that's what it did to me. The story plays itself out on multiple levels and can be interpreted in as many ways, making it interesting material to discuss subjects ranging from MPS to possession.   \\"Session 9\\" is that kind of movie that slowly crawls under your skin and increasingly gives you a feeling of unease and tension, that most horror movies today unfortunately are unable to instill. It is a subtle human drama, aided by fantastic performances by David Caruso and even more so Peter Mullan.  The latter is in charge of a clean-up crew that has to remove asbestos in a gigantic former psychiatric institution as part of preparations for a renovation. Peter Mullan's character Gordon really needs this job financially and was only able to beat competition in the bid for it by promising the contractor to do it in half the time, a week. Even for a team this experienced, excluding Gordon's nephew Jeff who is new in the business of asbestos removal, it makes it a quite stressful job, but at the end a bonus awaits them if they make it on time and so all of them agree to do it. All of them means, aside from Gordon and Jeff, Phil (David Caruso) who manages the team, Hank, an annoying guy who has a problem with Phil since hitting it off with Phil's former girlfriend which he never fails to point out to Phil and finally Mike, who gave up his law studies in college but is considering going back to it.  Gordon recently had a baby and is suffering a lot from the stress and exhaustion that comes with it, which is a concern to the others of the team, especially as business wasn't exactly booming before this job.   On day 1 both Mike and Hank make a find: the former a number of tapes with recordings of therapy sessions with someone called Mary suffering from MPS (Multiple Personality Syndrome) whose case he becomes obsessed with and the lattera collection of old coins which he decides to pick up at night to start a new life somewhere (which includes attending casino school in Vegas). It will be his last visit on the premises. After that night to the others Hank simply bailed and pressure on Gordon is even more increased to get the job done in time and he increasingly becomes convinced that his team is distrustful of his ability to pull it off. He has cause to think this as Phil tries to take over the reigns as he feels compelled to as a response to Gordon's increasing mental instability.  As an audience we regularly go back to a scene where Gordon sits in his car in front of his house waiting to go in as it is raining and he watches his baby cry, It's a flashback to the day he got the job and he is about to tell his wife the good news accompanied by groceries and flowers. We watch him go in and as the camera focuses on a pan with boiling water that accidentally is being poured on Gordon's leg by his wife we hear Gordon cry out in pain, soon followed by a cry of distress of his wife.  The sessions Mike listens to in the meantime increasingly make clear what happened to their subject Mary and gradually the relationship with the events in the present become clear.  The movie cranks up the tension through a series of events until Gordon reaches a breaking point with tragic consequences. Not until the end we find out what really was at the beginning of this chain of events, which is a shocking reveal.  Apart from being a very suspenseful thriller it's also a surprisingly impressive study of the dark side within our nature, which under normal circumstances we can easily keep in check, the primitive purely based on primal instinct primate within us, which can suddenly surface under the right circumstances and make us do things which we wouldn't have conceived of beforehand. The atmosphere inside the decayed institution is like Gordon's inner life, where the \\"asbestos\\", so toxic to other people, as it turns out, cannot be removed in time and does its devastating work.
B00006JKON|5.0|I love this album.  I stumbled into Tull in the late 80s and have the benefit of having no idea music like this existed, and thus no previous expectations.  This album is energetic, colorful, whimsical, serious, thought provoking, light and heavy - in other words, what Jethro Tull is made of.  Although the songs are shorter (after the two album-length predecesors, and none of the 7-10 minute epics prog fans might expect) the music is still rich - there's little classical sections in many songs, uncommon rock instruments like flute, soprano sax, accordion, and bagpipes, heavy rock and acoustic folky influences.  The lyrics are Ian Anderson's trademark cynicism, wit, whimsy, and biting satire.  Interesting yet accessible, unusual yet catchy.  Speaking for myself, I'd take any song off of this album over 95% of popular music.  This remaster also contains 7 bonus tracks!  And, these are good tracks - great non-album songs (as well as a fantastic jazz-meets-Bach instrumental and and orchestral piece).  Although I had the bonus tracks from the other Tull remasters already (mainly on \\"Living in the Past\\" and the 20th Anniversary Box Set), there were several I did not have here.  It's almost like hearing a new half-album from this era for old fans of the band.  Tull isn't really like other rock music (well, not in their mid-70's era), and it's not even like other progressive rock - it's very unique, in an English sort of way!  I don't get at all the negative reviews of this album.  Jethro Tull isn't everyone's cup of tea - there are critics of Beethoven and Bach, too.  I mean, if you're looking for extreme metal, King Crimsonish - avant-garde atonal jazz, or funk, yeah, it ain't here.  But, to complain this music is boring or too \\"pop\\" makes no sense - but then one of the people who said it's boring  then complained of too many \\"pointless key changes\\".  Er . . . it's boring because things are happening?  Well, I think we can pretty much ignore the input of those people, hmm?  Sorry, I get a little worked up by pointless criticism, but I'm OK now!
B0015KO52S|5.0|This is the best album Jack White has ever been a part of. And the White Stripes are probably my favorite band. But there's so much more to this album than just White. Patrick Keeler is a beast on drums throughout, LJ has some good basslines and keyboard parts, and Brendan Benson absolutely shines, especially on songs like Many Shades of Black, Attention, and Consoler of the Lonely. Everyone talks about how much more this album sounds like the Stripes than Broken Boy Soldiers did, but probably the biggest improvement to this album is how much stronger Benson sounds both on vocals and guitar. The overall sound to the album is stronger. There's a lot of start and stop/push and pull rhythms going on, and it's a lot harder than BBS was. There's some strings and Mariachi on a few tracks too, changing things up a little bit. It has some great softer moments as well. You Don't Understand Me is great, and I still get goosebumps listening to Carolina Drama.  This is easily one of the best albums of the year, if not the best. Jack White is one of those once in a generation talents in songwriting, and then when you combine it with the rest of the guys on here it sounds even better. If you like music just in general pick this album up, and go see them live. I saw them about a month ago. It was unbelievable.     Highlights  Hell, all of them. But especially  -Consoler of the Lonely  -Salute Your Salution  -You Don't Understand Me  -Top Yourself  -Many Shades of Black  -Carolina Drama
B0013ND30M|5.0|From what I gathered from viewing the interviews on the most recent \\"Platinum\\" release of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" this was Disney Studios' pinnacle of achievement in animation of that time. And indeed, the artistry is stunningly beautiful.  You get the full scope of what was put into it with this new widescreen edition.  However, unless you have a large wide-screen TV, the characters are nearly overwhelmed by the wide and \\"busy\\" background art.  The Full-Screen version seems to give one more of a 'personal' experience with the characters whereas the wide picture seems to distance you from them.  As for story, it is the 3 Good Fairies that carry the movie and have the best material.  Princess Aurora and Prince Philip seem almost incidental characters built around the story of the 3 fairies' heroics (Aurora and Philip have an amazingly small amount of dialogue).  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie, but next to \\"Cinderella\\" all the extravagance of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" does not hold a candle.
006056251X|5.0|This is book 3 of the Wallflower series and if you have not read the first two, you certainly should begin with [[ASIN:0061259349 Secrets of a Summer Night (The Wallflowers, Book 1)]].  Each and every one of Kleypas' books stand alone.  However, you will enjoy each much more if you've read the prior and become well acquainted with the characters.  Kleypas' absolute gift is taking an unlikely hero or storyline and taking you to a place that you could never have imagined.  The subtle journey is a wonder.<br /><br />Sebastian is the beautiful dangerous rake down on his luck.  Evie is the shy wallflower trying to escape the cruelties of her family.  Fate and dire circumstances brings them together.  What Kleypas marvels at is the intensely passionate, sometimes painful, but always rewarding journey to finding their true love.  Once again Kleypas will turn a man incapable of love into the perfect man we all yearn for, but you won't know how or when it happened.<br /><br />This is my favorite Kleypas book.  The storyline and characters will haunt your thoughts for a while.  Not many writers can improve year after year.  Thankfully, Kleypas does.  Enjoy.
B00005LC1H|5.0|After borrowing the set of discs several times we finally broke down and purchased a set of our own.  Several of the episodes are laugh out loud funny.
B000E1ZBH2|5.0|I think I watched it ten times in a row; it's that kind of movie. What a fantastic job done by the director and stunning cinematography. The music is some of the best I've ever heard. The acting was incredible! The scenery was amazing! You get sucked right in and never want to leave. I didn't think they could pull off a two hour version but it was so wonderful. I do wish it had been 30 minuets longer so we could see more interaction between Elizabeth and Darcy. But this version gets the point across with such passion it makes you want to melt. I think the casting was great, I especially liked Rosamund Pike and Mathew Macfadyen. I'm not a big fan of Knightley, but it was great casting she did well and I liked her in it. I think Brenda Blethyn cast as the mother was a bit annoying but maybe that was their point. I don't understand why all the book nuts say it has to sick by the book word for word. This is such an entertaining film and I think Jane Austen her self would have really enjoyed it.
0792163710|5.0|I guess if it's okay for her to get choked up watching all that Jane Austen stuff, then it's okay for me to have to fight back a few tears while watching little Joey run after his hero.    SHANE is one of the best westerns ever made.  It captures the essence of this American mythology and offers superb quality in a such a wide array which one rarely sees anymore.  For instance, the acting was just right; never over-the-top, never one-dimensional and boring, and never emotionally manipulative.  The camera shots were top notch and could easily compete with any western/epic of the last twenty years.  The action was fast-paced and intense, and yet this film is not ruled by the action sequences.  The characters carry this film, not the action.  The characters are likeable and very believable.    But perhaps my favorite thing about SHANE is the presence of the hero who on the surface appears too nice and too meek (the nice tough guy, if you will).  But at the right time, he is a force to be reckoned with.  Another of my favorite examples of this would have to be James Stewart in DESTRY RIDES AGAIN.    SHANE is one of the few films I've watched recently (for the first time in a long time) which left me wondering, \\"Why in the world have I not bought this yet?\\"
B000002KIT|5.0|Live and Dangerous is one of the best live albums ever made IMO at least. This album perfectly captures Thin Lizzy`s powerful live show during their heyday with the classic lineup of the late great Philip Lynott, Brian Downey, Brian Robertson and Scott Gorman, who absolutely delivers their unbelievably great brand of hard rock from start to finish on this album.     Top songs: Still In Love With You(greatest live Lizzy song ever), Johnny The Fox Meets Jimmy The Weed, Dancing In The Moonlight, Jailbreak, Sha-La-La and Warrior.    I highly recommend Live And Dangerous to everyone, especially fans of great classic rock from the 70`s. I guarantee that you most likely will be very addicted listening to this great album.
B00026WU64|5.0|It was with \\"Freewheelin'\\", his second album, that Bob Dylan established himself as a great songwriter. Featured are all-time classics like \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\", \\"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\\" and \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\". But some lesser known gems, such as \\"Bob Dylan's Dream\\", are also included. \\"Masters Of War\\" is an anti-war song with Dylan at his most venomous and \\"Girl From The North Country\\" is one of his most beautiful romantic ballads.     This is a young, idealistic Dylan playing raw, stripped down folk music. But with witty, perceptive and extremely sardonic lyrics that take it to a whole new level. To see the glorious roots of the best songwriter of the last 50 years there is no better place to start than here.
0786838655|5.0|My 10-year-old son started reading this series and was enjoying it tremendously, so I thought I'd skim it so we would have a common topic for discussion. Well, I ended up devouring it in record time! It was charming, well written, and had interesting characters. Plus, I've loved mythology ever since I was in school myself, so the whole Olympus/Greek gods tie-in was a major selling point.     The Harry Potter similarities weren't lost on me, but I never felt that Rick Riordan was just taking the cheap and easy way out. Instead, it seems he's giving anyone paying attention a literary \\"wink\\".     I'm currently on the third book in the series and I can honestly say that the second book and this one are every bit as enjoyable as the first.
1582701709|3.0|Of all my book reviews, this one has been the most difficult to write. This book had many good quotes, ideas, stories, and personal anecdotes that supported the basic premise of the book (at least from the author's perspective). The only problem was that I did not buy into the basic premise of the book: that the universe is one huge energy field, and that through the frequency of your thoughts that you project out into the world, you create and control your destiny by attracting back to you the things that are on the same frequency as your thoughts (the Law of Attraction (like attracts like) in action on a grand and personal scale).    Some of the problems I have with the whole concept of the book include, but are not limited to: it promised everything to everyone, often appealing to selfish desires (like \\"acquiring massive wealth\\"); \\"The Secret\\" was cleverly packaged and presented in a way so that if you find you are not reaping the miraculous and universally readily-available benefits of \\"The Secret\\" as described, you are obviously not a true believer and the fault lies solely on you - you have not achieved the type of `enlightenment' that you need to make \\"The Secret\\" work for you; I got the distinct impression that the author tried very hard to diminish any belief in God by directly equating God to energy, and indirectly by frequently using the term \\"the Universe\\" in lieu of any appropriate spiritual or heavenly reference; and I felt like the author tried too hard (and too repetitively) to show how \\"The Secret\\" has been universally applied to all situations and circumstances, which came across as trying to justify or legitimize \\"The Secret.\\"      On a positive note, there were more than enough good points and quotes throughout the book upon which to build a good, motivational, and inspirational character-refinement book. Some of the more memorable and thought-provoking passages are listed below.   -\\"Everything that has been invented and created throughout the history of humankind began with one thought. From that one thought a way was made, and it manifested from the invisible into the visible.\\" (p 57)  -\\"Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.\\" Martin Luther King, Jr. (1929-1968) (p 57)  -\\"All that we are is a result of what we have thought.\\" Buddha (563 BCE - 483 BCE) (p 73)  -\\"Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\\" Albert Einstein (1879-1955) (p 91)  -\\"Oftentimes you give others the opportunity to create your happiness, and many times they fail to create it the way you want it. Why? Because only one person can be in charge of your joy, of your bliss, and that's you. So even your parent, your child, your spouse - they do not have the control to create your happiness. They simply have the opportunity to share in your happiness. Your joy lies within you.\\" Lisa Nichols (p 122)  -\\"What you resist persists.\\" Carl Jung (1875-1961) (p 142)  -Praising and blessing equals love, and love is the greatest power in our lives. (p 151-153)  -\\"Erase everything from the past that does not serve you and be grateful it brought you to this place now, and to a new beginning. You have a clean slate, and you can start over - right here, right now....\\" (p 178)    If I had to rate this book on how well the author did in selling me on the book's basic premise, I would give it only one star. Solely due to the strength and value of some of the author's supporting arguments (taken independent of the points being supported), I chose to give it three stars, but I would be hard-pressed to recommend the book to anyone I know.
0446579939|5.0|Nicholas Sparks does it again with his latest novel, The Lucky One, a novel about an ex-marine's quest to search for the woman in the photograph who has been his lucky charm throughout his tours in Iraq and the relationship that develops once they meet.<br /><br />Logan Thibault is an easy-going and charming man who walks cross-country accompanied by Zeus (his dog) to find the mystery woman in the picture.  As the story develops, Logan finally meets the woman in the picture.  Simply wanting to be close to her to figure out how he 'owes' her for saving his life so many years as his lucky charm, he begins to build a relationship with her (Elizabeth 'Beth'), her son (Ben), and her grandmother (Nana).  There is also an integral involvement of the selfish, self-absorbed Keith Clayton to the story.<br /><br />Sparks tells the story from three perspectives, each evident by the chapter title.  The three characters each have different ways of thinking and Sparks' writing style for each corresponding chapter easily relates this to the reader.  This is an excellent way of telling this story since it would, most likely, be rather difficult (if not impossible) to tell the story simply from one point of view.  As expected, Sparks' storytelling is stellar both at developing the relationship between characters and unfolding a wonderful story with an emotional finish.<br /><br />After reading this book, you can't help but wonder, who is the lucky one in the story?  In my opinion, there are several lucky ones in this story.  It's amazing how a story simply based on a photograph can unfold into such a beautiful work of fiction.  If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, you won't be disappointed.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I got hooked on this show at about the 3rd episode.  I hardly ever watch TV but I can't not watch this.  It is so funny and brilliant.  Sheldon is so anal its hilarious and Leonard is just so sweet that you can't help but love him.  The other characters are so well matched and believable that you can truly enjoy the relationships.  The banter is never forced and is really tear-producing funny.  Now, we never miss an episode.  This DVD kept us from jonesing too much over the summer for the show.  The DVD is great with the extras they put on it.  Really puts everything in perspective like having a real physicist as a consultant so all their geek-speak is right.  It's great.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|Great movie. A must see and should be part of anyone's BD collection. Many good in depth reviews here, but plainly put this is a well scripted movie with a cast to pull it off.Very well thought out special features; haven't played with online features and probably won't after what negative feedback I've heard...

B000M5AJQS|1.0|...for Martin Scorcese that I feel very sorry for his precocious senility. I can't think of any other explanation (there is no excuse) for mistaking di Caprio for an actor (which is about as ludicrous as mistaking McDos for restaurants). And, since he's persisting in polluting the screens with something whose only merit is he never will be a \\"Has Been\\" (since he never was anything in the first place), from now on I will keep clear from Scorcese's movies.
B00139W3NE|4.0|None of the quasi scientific aspects of the book makes it into the movie. Character development, poor in the books, is of course worse in the movie. But most significant in comparison between the book and film is the avoidance entirely of who the Magisterium represents and so who the war is really against. As a result the plot must seem simply baffling to those who have not read the trilogy. The bears become the most interesting thing and it makes sense why an Oscar went in that direction. In short, this one is not a keeper. I have no interest in watching it again to seek nuances I might have missed nor would I be interested in seeing the other two books treated the same way. But as an interesting movie for kids it was beautifully done. The heroine will be good for girls who need more examples of young girls doing well and it should tweak imaginations.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|Although Death Magnetic was not as impressive as Metallica's older efforts frm the 80s, the album is still a step toward genuine thrash metal. Also, Kirk's solos have returned, although they are not quite as good as before. Still, excellent album.
B001ANE3EA|4.0|First, I must say I'm impressed by the shipping speed of amazon.com, I ordered this album yesterday in Hayward, CA, and I got it today at noon, while amazon.cn has never been this fast.    Actually, I've already bought the HK deluxe edition illegally when I was in China mainland, for I'm f**king tired of the censorship of my government, they did bring in the album to China mainland, but removed three songs from the standard list, including \\"Makes Me Wonder\\", \\"Wake Up Call\\" and \\"Kiwi\\". So if I wanted to listen to all the songs, I had to buy the HK release.    When I knew they were gonna release another deluxe edition of this album, I was pretty pissed off, not because the Rihanna remix version of \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" was added, but because they were adding a full concert into the bonus DVD, while in the DVD of HK Deluxe Edition, there are only 3 live performances, which means I have to buy this one.    Now that I'm now studying in the US, I could finally buy it here at a reasonable price. And it didn't let me down.    The concert is from their small tour, but the quality is not bad as the picture is formatted in 16:9 widescreen, and the sound is DD 5.1. Though compared with female artists' show, this one is a little too short, but it is still good to just listen to to some live music without artists' blah, blah, blah.    One thing I don't like about this concert is its setlist, this small tour is in support of THIS album, but there's only 4 new songs out of 12, and they didn't even perform \\"Wake Up Call\\". I heard they're still touring, and this one is said to be a big one, if they would release a DVD of the big tour, the setlist might change.    Nevertheless in all, if you haven't got the standard version of the album, this Deluxe Edition worth buying especially with a CD and a DVD at this price.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|I do like this song a lot! One of the songs I play a lot. Love coldplay, love this song. My favorite coldplay song for sure!!!! out of any album. The other song I like a lot right now if you click see my other reviews you can see my review on that song (The Warehouse Band). They are new on myspace, like em a lot.
B000UO4F8E|5.0|To me, Saw III is more epic because it's longer and has more soap opera elements to Amanda and Jigsaw's character. Tobin Bell does another awesome job as Jigsaw, who is now on his death bed. Jigsaw has Lynn kidnapped and brought to him so he can stay alive long enough to see if Jeff makes it through his test. Jeff has been a depressed dad for three years because his son was killed by a driver named Timothy Young. Jeff has three tests and must learn to forgive the people responsible for the death of his child. My favorite trap in this one is the Pig Vat when Jeff has to save the judge from drowning in ground up pig intestines. I love when Lynn has to perform surgery on Jigsaw and removing some of his skull to relax his brain. Will Jeff learn to forgive? Will Jigsaw live? Let's play a game and find out! If you love Jigsaw and the Saw movies, you'll love SAW 3!!!
B000VPUIA6|4.0|the beatles are the most famous group of people on the planet.everything that can be said about them,has.so there is nothing that i can really add except that help was their second movie and as such was not as good as their first.the reason to buy this pkg. is the extras.like how the movie was made by many of the people who were involved with its production.this is not just a movie but a slice of the history of the sixties.all of this is worth watching,the extras more so than the movie.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!
6305127697|4.0|The worst thing I can say about `Primal Fear' is that it plays out like an extended episode of `Law & Order'; but that being the worst of it is really not so bad.  I actually enjoy a good episode of `Law & Order', and beings that this follows the `SVU' pattern of process (which happens to be my favorite variation of the `Law & Order' franchise) I am really quite impressed with this film.  It isn't perfect, and there are a few plot holes that take away from the films credibility, but it is nothing so immense that it remains unforgivable.  No, `Primal Fear' is actually well crafted and splendidly acted to the point where its faults are easily overlooked.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Aaron Stampler, a troubled young man who was found fleeing the bloody aftermath of the archbishop's murder.  Aaron, who served as an alter boy, claims to have blacked out after seeing another man standing over the archbishop's body.  He doesn't remember a thing aside from the fact that he didn't do it.  Hotshot lawyer Martin Vail takes on Aaron's case free of charge, seeking the attention the high profile murder case will bring to his career.  What Vail gets is not as cut and dry as many felt it would be, and he finds himself stepping further and further down a road complete with numerous twists and turns.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of Richard Gere, but he is utterly flawless in this film.  His charisma is perfectly suited for this role, and he tones it down enough to give us a glimpse into the inner fears of this man.  Laura Linney, an actress I am eternally smitten, also delivers, but not as strongly as she usually does.  She comes off a tad too rehearsed for me in scenes.  Maybe it's just that she lacks chemistry with Gere, and so he makes her look bad by acting so much better around her.  Frances McDormand doesn't have that problem (is she ever `bad' though) as she bounces off Gere and Norton brilliantly.  Alfre Woodard and John Mahoney are also splendid in their supporting parts, bringing so much swagger and grace to their respective roles.<br /><br />But this movie belongs to one individual; Edward Norton.<br /><br />As Aaron, Norton brilliant shifts from innocent ignorance to brutal defiance.  He manages to make his characters twitches and emotional weight seem natural and most importantly, relevant.  We bleed for him, cry for him, shiver for him and in the end we believe in him.  This may be one of the greatest screen debuts of all time (right up there with Whoopi Goldberg).  Edward Norton has turned into one of our generation's greatest working actors, and this film is where that all began.  Just watch those eyes, manipulating and calculating and pleading all at the same time.  He is everything he needs to be and everything we need him to be, and he accomplishes this effortlessly.<br /><br />In the end I will highly recommend `Primal Fear'.  Yes, it could have tightened things up a little in certain areas, but what it does give us is a very nicely constructed legal thriller that will please any fan of the genre.  If you are a lover of `Law & Order' then this will satisfy your desires; but in the same respect, if you are often turned off by the legal courtroom drama's then this is not the film for you.ng parts, bringing so much swagger and grace to their respective roles.<br /><br />But this movie belongs to one individual; Edward Norton.<br /><br />As Aaron, Norton brilliant shifts from innocent ignorance to brutal defiance.

0385340990|5.0|I just can't say enough about this book.  I don't usually like WWII fiction, but this book is making me re-think that.  A book for book-lovers, a book for someone who has always wanted to write a book, a book for lovers, for friends, for the historical fiction lover, a book of connection, a book of everything.  Just everything.  Read this book.  You won't be sorry.
B000001E3V|1.0|I purchased this cd when it was first released and was very excited about the extra tracks this version have over Derek And The Dominos In Concert which was released on cd in the Eighties. After playing it and comparing it to the original Derek And The Dominos In Concert cd I was majorly dissappointed. The mixing on Live at the Fillmore puts Clapton up front of the soundstage making his contribution to the cd stand out. As for the rest of the band they sound like they are playing a block away. The cd has become known to myself and my friends as \\"Eric and the Dominos\\".  On the original In Concert cd the band is tight and Eric is where is suppose to be - in the band and not a soloist.  The music is awesome but the mixing on Live at the Fillmore  I really bad. If you are looking for a live version of Derek and the Dominos, pick up Derek and the Dominos In Concert.  Even though there are less tracks this version highlights the Band and not the Clapton the Soloist.
B0000CAQ26|1.0|i love pink. i bought her second album and loved it. Then this one came out 5 years ago. i didn't have any money at the time, but i liked the two singles \\"trouble\\" and \\"god is a dj\\"...however i never got around to buying it. Then she released \\"I'm not dead\\" like two years ago. it was awesome, it reminded me why i liked her in the first place. She's now about to release her 5 album and i love the new single.....so since i can't wait for it to be released..i thought i'd try this to satisfy my pink craving...Boy was i wrong.    there are two good songs on this cd. i have already named them. The rest of the songs are poorly sung, poorly written and sometimes strangely/poorly produced. i want my money back but you can't return open cds. she's not a rocker chick, and besides, she hardly has any hooks on here to prove she is one in the first place. truly dissapointing.
0393327345|5.0|For those of you who have never seen the movie, this book is a disturbing portrait of a narrator who begins to express his natural instincts and, before he realizes it, is terrified by what he has become a part of, leading up to a twist that you never saw coming.<br /><br />For those of you that have seen the movie, yes, it does translate well into book form. There is much more psychological introspection and more recurrence of themes (such as the line \\"look up into the stars and you're gone\\"). There is also a bit of an extended ending that wraps things up nicely.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a challenging read, but ultimately very satisfying. As far as contemporary literature goes, this is one of the best in my opinion.

0316042994|5.0|When Charles Ryder arrives at Brideshead after an absence of many years, he loses himself in reminiscences of the once grand home and residence of the intriguing Flyte family. Charles shares the story of his all-encompassing and complex relationship with the Flytes, which germinates with his college relationship with the eldest son, Sebastian, at Oxford. While sharing his opulent college days with Sebastian, the two become connoisseurs of fine food, good conversation, and especially in Sebastian's case, alcohol. Charles becomes unwittingly seduced by the luxurious lifestyle Sebastian leads, and although Sebastian tries to avoid the intrusion of his family into the friendship, Charles becomes enmeshed with them, growing increasingly entangled with their religious proclivities and emotional adversities. Eventually Charles moves past his friendship with Sebastian, who is on a course of self-destruction. Although he tries to leave Sebastian behind, his ties with the stifling family remain strong, and his ardor focuses on more accessible targets. As the glamor and artifice of the Flytes begins to fall away, Charles discovers his own moral awakenings, leaving him to reconcile the differences between himself and the Flytes as well as the similarities.<br /><br />This book is a stunning piece of literature. From the rich language to the captivating story it tells, it is easy to understand why this book remains a classic today. Though the story is arguably about one young man's immersion in a very unique family, there exists, parallel to the plot, the subject of divine grace and the examination of Catholicism as a moral compass which may shape even those who are not of the faith. The book also deals with the nostalgia for the British nobility, the disillusionment at the passage of youth, and speaks specifically about the many forms of love that assail us as human beings throughout life. The remarkable thing about all of this is that it is not done in a heavy-handed and cardboard way. It is not pounded into you with antiquated and stuffy language or sentimental observations that render the story artificially affected. Instead, there is a constant pushing and pulling of ideas, and a honest portrayal of relationships, religion, and youth that is not afraid to show the entire truth, warts and all. Aside from liking this book for the story that it told, I found it was engaging and entertaining in other aspects. The prose was lyrical while still being a little snarky and standoffish, giving it an offbeat charm and a knowing voice. When I had finished reading and closed the book, I found that there was so much more to think about and explore within the world presented to me. I looked back at scenes that were poignant, and was able to see that besides the obvious emotional impact there was a great deal more hiding within the narrative. Later, I found concepts that hadn't initially occurred to me, and I mused about the authors intentions with the direction of the story, and if indeed there was a subtle agenda. The book had a wonderful mood about it as well. The atmosphere was one of somberness, but it was not overwhelmingly dark and depressive. Things seemed to have the perfect gravity, neither too comedic nor too dismal. This is not to say that this was an entirely dark book; there were some perfectly comedic and witty moments, but overall the tone of this book was more serious, lending it the ability to become profound. This may give the perception that this is a deep book. Yes and no. I would say that on one hand it is a very deep book, but it depends entirely on how you read it. If you are reading it for the pleasure of an interesting story, that is what you will get. If on the other hand you are reading it for a deeper meaning, that is there as well. What I find interesting is that these elements exist completely in harmony with each other, while also remaining separate entities.<br /><br />I think the true measure of the success of this book is the fact that, although I have moved on to other books, I still find myself thinking about it. In quiet moments, I find myself plundering the depths of the story, eager to make more connections and relishing the moments and situations I found within the covers. The book had a powerful voice and message, and it was the ability of the author to show, not tell, his message that impressed and amazed me. The mechanics and eloquence of his ideas were equally impressive. Though the author's opinions may not be popular with every reader, and may even be contrary to those who are not particularly religious, the story and the execution are truly brilliant. This book was an exceptional and unexpected prize. Highly recommended.that, although I have moved on to other books, I still find myself thinking about it.

0786168765|4.0|This book is well written, using words that make the characters and locations come alive.  The insight into the Indian people and their heart is engaging.  The spiritual insight and philosophy that is demonstrated and spoken about by the characters gives one pause to think about in relationship to one's daily life.      At times, I thought that the author's experiences as he related them appeared to be far fetched if true.  They do make the tale more interesting.      With regards to the audio CD, I enjoy the reader.  The different voices with their appropriate accents enhances the \\"reading\\" (listening) experience.
6304884419|1.0|Do not buy from Amazon marketplace vendor MOVIESONSALE1. They advertised Bronx Tale as wide screen but sent the movie in full screen version with misleading packaging. Now I know why their rating is only 89% satisfaction. They collect money and deposit it and accrue interest and wait for the buyer to complain. I waited over a month to watch this movie and I went ballistic. After contacting the seller they claim they will send me a prepaid envelope and a full refund.
B00138H0Z6|2.0|Although this will get buried on the last page I can only say that anyone who has actually listened to (and thought about) The Memphis Record will agree that the album on offer here -- From Elvis In Memphis -- is just more of the same schmaltz that almost ruined Elvis' career in the first place. The shock of The Memphis Record -- what made it new at that point in his career -- was the Memphis sound. Several reviewers have naively called this a \\"muddy\\" mix, which this re-release allegedly corrects. They are mistaking a driving rhythm section and a pared-down mix for poor audio quality (and I wonder how many other masterpieces they are missing out on as a result of this misconception). It's not called \\"From Memphis\\" simply because it was recorded there (like \\"Dusty In Memphis\\", right?). The version on offer here misses out on all the bolt-of-lightening-out-of-nowhere impact of The Memphis Record, largely because of its anemic and regressive mix (vocals far too up-front, hard L-R pan). Yes, the sound was muddy at times (e.g. Inherit the Wind) but reviewers are confusing recording engineering for production; the engineering on From Elvis in Memphis is great, but the production is wrongheaded and banal. Do yourself a favor and buy a used version of The Memphis Record CD; you'll never go back.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|First off, it seems Metallica are finally starting to steer back towards what made them Metallica.  This album has some good riffing from Hetfield, something I've missed for several years.  Guitarist should be find the fun again in learning new Metallica riffs.     The issue of the sound of the album has been talked about to death, and I would only mirror those complaints. So I'll just skip that issue.     Solos are back, but sadly they really are not that memorable.  It almost sounds as if Hammett is soloing over sections he hasn't heard before.  They are in key and he plays them well, but most lack structure and there's very few memorable melodies/phrases.  Still, negativity/nitpicking aside, it is nice to have solos on a Metallica album again!    There are some intros that just seem tacked on with no thought behind them.  Its as if they wrote a complete song then someone came up with a riff and they just threw it onto the beginning.  All Nightmare Long and Judas Kiss are the biggest offends of this, in my opinion.    Aside from those cons, I think this is a great album.  There are some moments on Death Magnetic that I feel measure up to the Metallica of the 80s.  But this is only a step in the right direction, I can't wait for the follow-up if they stick to this path.
0060834838|3.0|I would very much like to offer a complete review of this title.  However, despite it being listed as in Large Print....I can not read it which upsets me to no end.  Large Print books need to be in Large Bold Print so vision impaired folks can at least have a decent crack at reading like a normal person.  I really wanted to read this book as it is quite inviting....but it will be a very slow process.  Good luck if you have any kind of serious vision problem
B000OCXFCO|3.0|I see this album compared to its predecessor, The System Has Failed, more often than not.  Personally, I can't hear the similarities.  The System Has Failed had some really inspired tracks with some great solos by both Mustaine and Poland.  Untied Abominations on the other hands has only a few good songs and a few good solos from Mustaine and Glen Drover.  Shawn Drover sounds stiff and out of place to me, but others appear to dig him so maybe I'm the black sheep of the Megafans.    The production of this album doesn't do it any favors either.  Its not bad but it lacks balls, the entire albums feels really squashed and small.  The System Has Failed also had some production issues but it still had a sound that had some size to it.    Overall, its another step in the right direction for Mustaine and company.  Check this one out after most of the previous albums.

You must get this album!!!!!
0307120007|1.0|I was born and raised in another country, so I didn't grow up with this bunny, but I heard so much about it and was told it's a classic.  I decided to purchase one for my son.  I have to say it's a major disappointment because 1) it's poorly made that's not strong enough to sustain an infant's pulling, chewing, and abusing, 2) the sharp edge of the book always seems to hit my son's face (I'm afraid it will scratch his eyes one day...), 3) the fabric in the peek-a-boo page is very weak that it probably will come off in a few months, 4) the smell of the flowers is so storng (considering I try to buy everything organic and without perfume), 5) Daddy's scratchy face? it's a piece of sandpaper which is so rough that I would not let my son touch it in case it hurts his soft skin.  Overall, I think it might have been a great concept in 1940, but time has changed and so should the construction of the book itself.

B001CC7PPI|5.0|Every film is an artifact of its era and \\"Rear Window\\" is no different so those expecting slam bang action like they see in \\"The Matrix\\" should look elsewhere. All of that said, \\"Rear Window\\" still stands tall as a film classic because of the themes, artistry of Hitchcock, the performances and the witty dialogue that we hear in the film. Unseen except for rare TV performances in the early 60's and rare revival house showings, \\"Rear Window\\" looks extremely good in its DVD presentation although clearly no complete restoration was done here like was done for \\"Vertigo\\" (but \\"Rear Window\\" wasn't in as bad a shape as \\"Vertigo\\" either). This edition looks better than the previous DVD (although it should be noted it's the same transfer as what was in the Hitchcock boxed set release four years ago)with a nice anamorphic transfer. Some people seem to think that film grain is a bad thing--it's not it's just how the film looks and \\"Rear Window\\" is no exception. Expecting this to look like a film produced in 2008 isn't realistic and it won't--but it still looks darn good.<br /><br />Extras are as follows: The extras that came with the boxed set as well as those from the previous single DVD release have been ported over to this release as well. We get two new delicious extras--a theme appropriate episode of \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" with the Hitchcock directed episode \\"\\"Mr. Blanchard's Secret\\" and also excerpts from the interview Traffaut did with Hitchcock for his book in the early 60's.<br /><br />Other extras: Audio commentary by author John Falwell, \\"Rear Window Ethics\\", Interview with Writer John Michael Hayes\\", \\"Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master\\", \\"Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock\\", production notes, theatrical trailers, photo gallery, audio interview excerpts from Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock,<br /><br />A plot synopsis is below for those intereested:<br /><br />Spying through a glass darkly (his camera lens), L.B. Jefferies (Jimmy Stewart) believes a neighbor (Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. His evidence is circumstanial at best and the wheelchair bound photographer has to convince his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly)of the crime. In the process he puts his friends in harm's way. Hitch laces his film with more than a touch of humor and irony pulling this thriller together as it's L.B.'s peeping that reveals the ugly underneath--revealing something unsavory about himself as well without him truly realizing it.<br /><br />Hitchcock manages to do more with less than just about any director out there. Using a single soundstage, a small cast and the witty script by John Michael Hayes, Hitchcock crafts one of his classic films. \\"Rear Window\\" has aged yes but it looks, sounds and plays remarkably well fifty four years after it's original theatrical release.

0689105657|5.0|Every two or three years, I have brought out Shogun and reread it which now amounts to about twelve times. Every time, the book takes on new dimensions and tones. The story of John Blackthorne, a Dutch seafarer who makes it across the Pacific to the Japans, is an enthralling and embracing story. One of the most engrossing elements of the story is Blackthorne's struggle with Japan's language and culture. As the embodiment of the stranger in a strange land, we too are taken on this great journey set in Japan's feudal kingdom. The characters are extraordinarily well-drawn. The plotting is intricate. The description of the society is detailed and insightful.<br /><br />Even if you read it once, you will go on a priceless journey.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I think this album gives a fine example of a great band with 30 years together can still create some great musical ideas.  Alex's guitar playing shows a restrained maturity, and the emphasis on accoustic guitar really complements the album.     I really liked Malignant Narcissism, as it builds a unique groove, and Alex's work on \\"Hope\\" which is really a standout on the album.  Geddy seems to have found a new voice which is less shrill and surprisingly powerful.   Niel's drum work is, of course, flawless throughout--  refined, tight and perfect.    Lyrically, sometimes Neil strays a little too far into the \\"what is it all about\\" territory, but in general, a lot of emotion comes through in the material.

The new officers must suffer the looks and doubts of the experienced dogfaces while the veteran officers must fulfill their missions - all the while dreading the loss of men that they have come to know and respect. We feel their hopes and dreams. We hope that they live to fulfill these dreams.<br /><br />In perilous times such as the present fight against terrorism this DVD set is a fitting introduction and education that the threat of National Socialism and Radical Islam requires our attention, devotion and sacrifice now and for the Next Generation.<br /><br />Watch the show with your family, including the children old enough to understand. Take the time to explain the history and threat. To give context to the duty of the soldiers to our Country. The reason for the genocide against the Jews. The need for future vigilance.

The characters are relentlessly stupid and I never felt, for a second, like I would ever want to have to do with them.

B0019EXZXU|5.0|Flat out funny and smart film. To say anything would spoil the film. The film never stops with the actions and moments that make you snicker.<br /><br />Disc 2 is the digital copy, compatible with Windows Media and iTunes. The bonus features on Disc 1 were pretty nice, going into the heist.<br /><br />If you liked The Italian Job (old or new), get this film. If you like the Bond films, get this film.
B001C3KCSY|3.0|But it sure doesn't have me excited about Kings of Leon like every other release has.  I am not going to flame them for cleaning up the sound but I will say I am truly disappointed in this effort.  Gone is the dynamic, risk taking and most of the fun from their earlier releases.  In its place is a band that is so tight that it has squeezed most of the air out the room.  I liked the unshowered, slept on the floor gripping a bottle feel of the band.  Their unabashed rock and roll ethos was what drew me to them and allowed me to overlook their occasional corniness and rote writing.  Here they have brought everything into to focus and it is a pretty, but also, pretty generic picture of a band that, to me, seems to have lost their sense of themselves.  I hope it is a minor wrong turn.  Kings of Leon have done enough right to be given another chance but this album doesn't seem destined for a long stay in my heavy rotation.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Another great John Hughes film, up there with Ferris Bueller and the first two Home Alones.<br /><br />This film is high school to a T. The memories, personalities, the faculty. Some people call that stupid, and that may be true. For me, this movie encompassed high school all around, and it is nice to spend a Saturday Afternoon watching the film.<br /><br />The extras are nice, but I got the film for the film. I was looking to buy back a few months back and they discontinued the other releases until this one came out.
0452289963|5.0|Please, Please read this book. Tolle tells us about the final frontier, and how urgent it is that we individually go there. It has altered my life, and the life of many I know in a very positive way. It is truly an awakening for all, and deserves multiple readings.  C.D. Brown
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Hurts to hear the truth huh? Just like its hard to look into this light after spending your life in darkness.  I think that the majority of people who didn't like the album are simply suffering from a commercial music sucker punch.  Its ok though, the rest of us get it.<br /><br />I love this album.  It challenges the evils of the system. It embraces enlightenment. It celebrates life (R.I.P. J Dilla) while addressing hardships that we all can relate to.  It calls for a mass awakening. It provides the listener with a small artist bio AND it ultimately ends on a sweet note (literally).<br /><br />Look, if your searching for the next top neo soul artist, go pick up some Rapheal Sadiq.  Hes one of the best to do it.<br /><br />If your are looking to play an active role in the revolution, pick up this cd and LISTEN TO IT, ALL OF IT! Mouth the words and then get out and do something!!<br /><br />They keep us uneducated,<br />Sick and depressed<br />(they end up in blood)<br />Doctor I'm addicted now<br />I'm under arrest<br />(they end up in blood)<br /><br />CAUSE<br /><br />They don't know their language<br />They don't know their God<br />They take what their given<br />Even what it feels Odd<br />They say their grandfathers and grandmothers work hard for nothing<br />And we still in this ghetto<br />So they end up in prisons<br />They end up in blood
0452289963|5.0|I can't recall reading a book that has had as huge an impact on my life as 'A New Earth'.  Tolle has explained how we can reclaim control over our lives by understanding that most of us function under the control of our ego, which has an agenda of its own.  Once we realize that's not who we are, everything changes.<br />This is the best non-fiction book I've ever read.  I recommend it to everyone; no exceptions.
B0017MO10U|5.0|For all those who love the 10 years of Stargate you will love this new flick.  It is a new look with a new twist.  ENJOY!
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|Since I purchased this CD I have listened to it repeatedly.  It gets better each time!  Adele is a fresh new voice on the music scene and she is fantastic.  Sometimes it seems like I'm listening to a combination of Nina Simone, Ella Fitzgerald and Adele!  Chasing Pavements is one of my favorite tracks along with Hometown Glory.  She is headed for stardom and it is so welcome!  So many new stars in music can't really sing and she stands out because her voice is a rare blend.  I saw Adele on an episode of the View and bought the CD the same day.  There is a lot of talent coming out of England and this young English Miss will be a superstar!
0375826726|2.0|*SPOILERS AHEAD, BEWARE* To me, the Inheritance Trilogy really lost its punch midway through book 2, when Eragon is essentially given all of the power and strength he needs to complete the tasks at hand without really working for it.  He suffered through his grievous injuries and was beginning to learn things through hard work and resilience, when POOF, it was decided that he had suffered enough, so everything he needs is bestowed upon him.  This shows through no more clearly than in the first few chapters of Brisinger, when Eragon and Roran dispatch the Razzac with ease.  Keep in mind that these two evil things were two of the most powerful creatures in the land in the first book, so much so that the dragon had to flee from them.  The story is tedious, I usually read quickly; however, this book took some time to get through.  Too much time is spent discussing political and social points of view, such as the social morality of being a vegetarian, addressing the question of capital punishment, or the essential qualities of a being a competent leader.  As a result the story drags.  The characters of Eragon and Saphira have become extremely shallow, as he is strong enough now both mentally and physically to essentially do what whatever he wants, but he is forced to struggle with the fact that he is 'bound' by the fact that he made too many promises to too many people and has to figure out which ones he must keep, and the fact that he can't find a sword that doesn't break.  Saphira is shown to be callous, shallow, and arrogant, so why would you root for her.  The elves are so powerful that we find they can overrun any human population around them as their army moves forth from hiding in their forest, which begs the question as to why the entire race of super-powerful beings remained in hiding because of a single man (Gallbatorix) who surely could not have defeated them had they attacked in force.  The only character that shows any real depth is Roran, who, being a merehuman, is forced to face the fact that he has no choice but to be a warrior if he ever wants to return to his home and resume a quiet life with his wife (who oddly enough doesn't really seemed too messed up from MONTHS of imprisonment and torture).  The story had a promising start, but continues to disappoint as it progresses.
0307269752|4.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson is one of the best reads so far this year.  Like the books I've read by other non-American authors it is wordy.  Reading Larsson's work was for me similar to reading Umberto Eco.  Translated works can take just a bit of commitment, but like Eco's work, Larsson's novel is worth it.  Then, of course, there are the Scandinavian names and the constant reference to the Kronor, the Swedish unit of money.  For me none of this was a problem, it's just something you deal with when you read a translated work.  Trust me, in the end the story makes it all worthwhile.<br /><br />I also have to admit that I had a real difficult time getting through the early stages of the novel.  Until I reached page 100, or there-a-bouts, I really thought that perhaps I'd made a huge mistake and thrown away $24.95 (less the discount).  Well, I needn't have worried.<br /><br />The Girl delivers on every level.  Well written, with an intelligent plot that will keep you coming back, wonderful pacing, and great writing style, Larsson treats the reader to a memorable experience that will linger even after you turn the last page.  Then there are the memorable characters such as Mikael Blomkvist, a magazine reporter and editor who is on his way to jail for supposedly printing slanderous material on a wealthy industrialist, or Lisabeth Salander, a troubled, tattooed and pierced young woman who is much more resourceful that her guardians or the courts are aware.  Only her part-time employer Dragon Armansky appreciates Salander's research talents.<br /><br />A nearly forty year old disappearance (murder????) of Harriet Vanger, a sixteen year old member of a wealthy Swedish family serves as the center piece of The Girl.  There are other plot elements including greed, abuse of women on the most personal levels possible, dysfunctional families, and the list goes on.  I won't give a way the ending, don't want to be a spoiler here, but suffice it to say that you'll be glad that you stick with the book until the end.<br /><br />The sad news is that Larsson died before The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo was ever published.  The really good news is that there are two additional books he finished before his death.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is the first in the Millennium series.  The Girl Who Played with Fire which is due out in January, 2009, and Castles in the Sky will complete the set.  An unfinished fourth part will remain unfinished.<br /><br />The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a terrific read.  You won't be sorry you picked it up.ck with the book until the end.

0375826726|3.0|This book is ok, but it doesn't keep my attention well. During the dinners and 'debates' I found myself staring at a word for about twenty minutes thinking about my cat, Sara Palin, Barrack Obama, and French. Then I would suddenly snap out of it, and read again, but I wouldn't take in a word of it. The action sequences are the only reason I rated this book three stars, after all, I am a violence-loving teenage boy.    I thought that Eragon would be smarter now that he was an elf hybrid. He isn't. Some things that took Eragon weeks to figure out took me only a few seconds.    This book is really violent. There is a sequence where Roran kills a whole bunch of people, and there's pages of things like 'Roran could feel the man's brains giving way, and blood sprayed all over him'. Now I'm not normally squeamish, but that was pretty violent.   The action sequences are good for Eragon. I guess it's because he can kill people with a wave of his hand, but there's a lot less blood involved in his chapters. Which reminds me, he's not a vegetarian any more, like he was in the last book.   One last complaint. This book follows the story line of Star Wars so closely I knew what the 'suprise' ending would be. And sure enough, I was right. Yoda died. I recommend waiting until it comes out in paperback.
B000VPUIA6|5.0|Need I say more??? A must have for all Beatles fans out there! Video and sound quality are excellent. Lots of rare photos and video footage added to this package. Well worth it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|THIS CD WAS VERY GOOD SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HER BECAUSE OF THE HIT SINGLES I KISSED A GIRL AND U R SO GAY BE SHE MAKES VERY GOOD MUSIC
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|So, earlier it was $26.95 (qualified for free shipping) and now it's 24.95 (no free shipping)...hmmmm....
B00192KCQ0|1.0|yes,  I said it.  This is the best metallica album since the early days,  but what does that mean?...it's better than the load albums and saint anger.  Rock and metal fans make me laugh, if an album has heavy guitars and drums it's considered a great piece of music. This album might be heavy, but it also has no feeling and sounds forced. every song is over 6 minutes long,  very boring stuff.  If you want to invest in a good album go and pick up the new testament CD \\"formation of damnation.\\" I bet most of these metallica fans have never even heard of testament.
0307269752|5.0|While it took close to one hundred pages to get into this book, I am so very glad that I stuck with it.  Yes, translations can be clunky, yes, the cast of characters was huge, yes, it was long.  It was worth every one of those minor faults and more.  It took all those pages and all those characters to create such a marvelous mysterious drama.  This author was obviously genius to keep all these plot lines and characters in check.  I, too, regret he will not provide more than this trilogy.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|this book is overestimated. i think that a book that swears like in every sentence and talks about adult matters is a teen book if not an adult book. but this book was a good one overall.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I love listening to the CD.  I loved listening to Bon Jovi in the 80's and now.  I like that it does have a little Country in it now.  I really like the song that he does with Big and Rich.
B000HWZ5W4|5.0|i recieved pictures at eleven as a gift and was blown away by how many times i still listen to it. robbie blunt is almost as good as page.  this album is a bit longer but still just as good retaining the same elements. in all his other albums he changed his style.    a classic plant album!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|They've nailed it. They've absolutely nailed it. My long-going, seemingly insurmountable level of anticipation (three years worth) has been shattered. I am just blown away by the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. Yes, masterpiece.<br /><br />The Nolan brothers and David Goyer created a story that is wonderfully complex and truly gripping. They drew pieces from some of the best parts of Batman classics like The Long Halloween, The Man Who Laughs, The Killing Joke, and surely many others (those are just what came to mind as I watched) and made something possibly even better. This isn't your usual throwaway piece of pop culture entertainment. It's much closer to art. The screenplay says so many intriguing things about humanity. Where is the proverbial line? How far can it be pushed to achieve what is ultimately a good and honorable goal? What is true heroism? When the chips are down, how will people react? These are the questions we're faced with. The Dark Knight doesn't presume to answer them for us, but it challenges us to discover the answers for ourselves. I've read several articles that go so far as to say that they think the film is being political, but I argue otherwise. I can't speak for the filmmakers, so maybe I'm wrong. However, the challenging topics of this film have been explored in countless Batman stories over a span of 70 years. These aren't new ideas to the Batman mythos. If anything, this just proves how relevant Batman continues to be, generation after generation.<br /><br />As for the film's technical aspects, let's talk about the guy most responsible for this film: Christopher Nolan. Can this guy make a bad film? Film by film, Nolan's been cementing himself as one of the great directors of our time. Memento, Batman Begins, The Prestige.... these are all amazing, top-tier films. And now, with The Dark Knight, I think everyone is going to finally realize just how good this guy is. And how about Wally Pfister's cinematography? Just gorgeous, gorgeous stuff. The score is very well done, too. It feels like a natural progression of the themes presented in Batman Begins. The new, much talked about one-note-based theme for The Joker works exceptionally well. And, of course, this wouldn't be a Batman film without some great action. Aerial stunts, car chases, explosions, and plenty of fight sequences.... The Dark Knight is a jolt of caffeine that keeps your heart racing from start to finish.<br /><br />While the action sequences and stunts are amazing, the more intimate scenes are the heart of the film. As a prime example, an interrogation scene between The Batman and The Joker honestly just shocked me. I figured their interaction would be good.... but it's much, much better than that. It's amazing to see such great character work in a blockbuster. And not only is it great character work, but the fabled complex relationship between Batman and The Joker is portrayed perfectly. At one point in the film, The Joker says this to Batman: \\"You won't kill me, out of some misguided morality, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think we're destined to do this forever.\\" Just perfect. Talk about a Batman fan's dream come true....<br /><br />One thing I don't think I can say enough about (and can't really do justice for anyway) is this interpretation of The Joker. After this performance, The Joker is definitely Ledger's. I can't imagine his take ever being topped. The Joker has always been one of the classic literary villains just aching for an accurate big-screen portrayal and man, Heath did it better than I could've ever hoped. He's somehow managed to pull off being funny, sadistic, charismatic, and downright frightening all at once. You can't take your eyes off the guy. And you can't decide whether you want to laugh or throw up when you hear his jokes. And often when he does make you laugh, you feel bad for doing so. That, my friends, is The Joker. And most importantly, this Joker is the perfect opposition for The Batman.... a true and constant threat that challenges him in nearly every way imaginable. Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins. This performance is just that good.<br /><br />I also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Eckhart's Harvey is noble, yet cocky and angry enough before the accident to really sell it when Harvey is horribly injured and unleashes his darker side. I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well. The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly. The rest of the performances are solid, too. I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films. These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.<br /><br />But who is this picture about? The Batman, of course, and they're continuing to get him absolutely right. Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne. He's perfected the \\"fake Bruce Wayne\\" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac. He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is. He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know. And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman. In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing. He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable. He walks the razor's edge every night. He's also becoming more self-sufficient. We see him doing more detective work. We see him making technological advances with little or no help from Lucius Fox. As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story. The decisions he makes throughout the film show us this progression. And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.<br /><br />I think it's safe to say that after this no one will ever look at the \\"comic book genre\\" the same again (if it's even fair to label this artistic vision as such). This is the father -- or The Godfather, as many critics have said -- of the genre. Look, I love Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Godfather. Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again. But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen. Yes, probably all of those films (and many others) will always have a bigger impact on the history and future of filmmaking, but the quality of this film -- groundbreaking for the genre -- combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise. The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all-time. Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, \\"escalation,\\" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level. Finally, we've gotten the film that will almost certainly be met with unanimous agreement as the definitive take on the character.

Everyone's talking posthumous Oscar for Heath and I sure hope he not only gets nominated, but that he wins. This performance is just that good.    I also really, really appreciate the other new central character: Aaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Eckhart's Harvey is noble, yet cocky and angry enough before the accident to really sell it when Harvey is horribly injured and unleashes his darker side. I have to give some serious credit to the writers here, as well, for adapting the character so well. The tragic side of the character comes across perfectly. The rest of the performances are solid, too. I love the way Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman have elevated these films. These guys are some of the best we have and never seem to disappoint. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a welcome addition to the cast replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Going in, I think I would've preferred Katie Holmes to stick around just for continuity sake, but Gyllenhaal does such a fine job that it's really not an issue.    But who is this picture about? The Batman, of course, and they're continuing to get him absolutely right. Christian Bale is just an excellent Bruce Wayne. He's perfected the \\"fake Bruce Wayne\\" by acting like a silly rich drunkard, womanizer, and egomaniac. He's hilarious a lot of the time, but we never forget just how selfless of an act it really is. He also embodies the real Bruce Wayne which only Alfred and Rachel (and Fox to some degree) truly know. And last, but definitely not least, he's a heck of a Batman. In The Dark Knight, you can tell Batman is maturing. He's becoming the signature Batman who pushes the line of what's decent and acceptable. He walks the razor's edge every night. He's also becoming more self-sufficient. We see him doing more detective work. We see him making technological advances with little or no help from Lucius Fox. As for the title of the film: Batman truly becomes The Dark Knight in this story. The decisions he makes throughout the film show us this progression. And the decision he makes at the end of the film is one of the most refreshing takes on heroism and selflessness that I've ever seen put on film.    I think it's safe to say that after this no one will ever look at the \\"comic book genre\\" the same again (if it's even fair to label this artistic vision as such). This is the father -- or The Godfather, as many critics have said -- of the genre. Look, I love Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, and The Godfather. Those are fantastic films that I could watch over and over again. But I'm going to go ahead and say it: this is the best film I've ever seen. Yes, probably all of those films (and many others) will always have a bigger impact on the history and future of filmmaking, but the quality of this film -- groundbreaking for the genre -- combined with my love of the Batman character and his world leave me completely unable to say otherwise. The film also, of course, dethrones the great Batman Begins as my favorite film of all-time. Begins did a magnificent job exploring the origins of the character, but along with its main theme, \\"escalation,\\" The Dark Knight just takes things to a whole new level. Finally, we've gotten the film that will almost certainly be met with unanimous agreement as the definitive take on the character. This is The Batman.... this is The Dark Knight.
159562015X|3.0|well, the book itself is pretty slim, clear and logically structured. In truth - I like the book! The arguments seem understandable and in relation to the costs buying the book is a great bargain. The fact, that my wife has three of five abilities that make me \\"complete\\" in my way to power - is simply thrilling me. Even though there is always the light smell of someone making lots of money related to such \\"life-guiding\\" books and with internet-business and the sneaking suspicion that it all might not be so trustworthy or true at all.    Despite all those bad thoughts I have bought this book nine times(!) now, because with the book it \\"seems\\" you can \\"box\\" the psychological working behaviour of a team-member or person (specially oneself) pretty good - no: excellently. If you think positive to help him/her/us/them grow...    And there comes the BUT...  Of course one is tempted to \\"put people in boxes\\" with such a seamingly simple guide. (Whereas the simplicity is actually the books strength compared to related many-pages reports from consultancies). I think it is not enough to have five strenght items when the one tested appears to have time-, personal or lifemanagement-problems primarily (even though reduction is a way to gain better results and faster). Strengthening ones talents means also to work on personal deep-psychological issues arraising from the past. Which the book does not mention at all. To go for deep human understanding can not be accomplished by a book and in this way the book is too progressive and superfacial. Of course they do not claim to do else! Also one has the feeling that zodiacs in papers have a similar wording, which in other words means: of course everyone wants to have compliments and a positive insight into ones strengths but it is kept too general to not be seductively true to each and everyone.(Of course it fits to an extend, when you look at the questions of the test, that clearly are related to the themes...).     So it is wright, that one is more of something and that the other one has more abilities of something else. Which could honestly also be found out by looking at ones interests, behaviour, dreams and wishes without the book I think.    What I miss about the conclusio the most: whose fitting into the scheme of someone else is very important and that issue was not mentioned. Also which people clearly should stay away from each other without helping third parties is also not mentioned, because it could sound \\"negative\\" - I guess. BUT it is also very important! There are types of people that step on each others toes! So how do I handle someone very different, when going building up my strengths? how can I or the other person catch up with each others needs and understand it better? I also did not find any comparison charts, where from the begining on the need of assisting strengh-holders were listed to the complimentary strengths. In short words: everyone should get a list of needed strenghts people with complementary skills as well.    All in all a good black and white proof for things that you might know or not, might look at or not. Even better for checking the strengths of people that you might not know that well. The book itself could improve by not only telling what you should force on yourself, but how you get stronger, when correctly dealing with the strengths of others as well...    But Tom, many thanks for the book. Cheers.

0765348780|3.0|Let me start out by saying that I will most likely read every book in this series because I'm such a fantasy fan and this series definitely has a lot to offer for people who enjoy the genre, but if you actually like a clear plot with a well-developed world and well-explained environments, keep moving.  This one is not for you.    The first 100 pages kept me thinking wondering if I was really reading the first book in the series.  It was a lot like the Black Company series for those of you familiar with Glen Cook, but it completely lacked any of the real \\"down-to-earth\\" characters for which Cook is famous.      The mages are all ridiculously powerful, live thousands of years, and use some crap called Warrens that don't make a bit of sense.  The non-human races are relatively unexplained except for tangential descriptions that bear a semblance to other races developed by other authors or series, and several of them are either immortal or live for tens of thousands of years.      All in all, it's not a bad read as fantasy goes, but it leaves the reader having to fill a whole lot of stuff in on their own until the author deigns to fill in some of the blanks for us.  Even after the first 500 pages of what is speculated to be a 10 book series, I'm not sure who the heck the \\"bad guys\\" actually are.    For those of you on the fence, think of Donaldson's Covenant series mixed with the styles of Cook, Salvatore, and Turtledove character development.  As a writer, I'm impressed with the depth of the world and history, but as I reader, I'm left wanting a bit more explanation as to what the heck is going on.

B000002UAX|5.0|At the end of \\"Glass Onion\\" is when you know you are in for something unique and special from the Beatles on The White Album. The end of the song features a slow, piercing violin meshed with a \\"dink, dink, dink\\" sound that prepares the listener by saying \\"Okay, we are going to do something different and we are going to lay it all on the line for you, so be ready.\\" Although I believe Revolver to be the quintessential Beatles album because of its mastery of the balance of art and pop, I believe The White Album to be the very best Beatles album of them all because it has aged the best. Paul himself said, \\"It stood up, but it wasn't a pleasant one to make.\\" Admit it, Sgt. Pepper sounds like a 1967 album, (which doesn't necessarily hinder its greatness) but The White Album does not sound like a 1968 album. It rocks, but most importantly, it experiments. For a pop group of the Beatles' magnitude, making a double album was a brave move indeed. But with all of their massive success, what did they have to lose? They finally came to realize that making music isn't supposed to be fun, it is supposed to be an adventure and make you push yourself beyond your limits. There is no conceptual theme, just a bravura of eclectic styles and genres boldly bouncing off each other. Trust me, the Beatles tried EVERYTHING on here: rock, pop, blues, chamber hall, vaudeville, Rodgers/Hammerstein-style orchestration, avant-garde experimentation, folk rock, surf rock...and \\"Helter Skelter\\" might be the first heavy metal song ever recorded. Also, \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is probably the first time an interlude was done in pop music. This album perfectly illustrates the evolution of the Beatles. The only thing missing is band unity, but no worry - the magic that pays off in the risk-taking more than compensates. Here's the best part: despite all the ground that is being covered, there are no bad songs to be found! For my tastes however, \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In the Road?\\" are just okay to me. The former has a nice catchy piano melody, but the lyrics are somewhat trite and the latter is very repetitive, although it must be noted that Paul sings each verse in a different fashion and the short length of the song saves it from oblivion (you might not notice Paul singing each verse differently until about the third or fourth time of listening to it). The notoriety surrounding \\"Revolution 9\\" is unjust. There have been better avant-garde recordings and there have been worse. Say what you will about \\"Revolution 9\\", but the chronology of \\"Cry Baby Cry\\", \\"Revolution 9\\", and \\"Good Night\\" is, to my ears, perfectly sequenced. \\"Julia\\" is John's most sentimental moment (it is an ode to his mother who died in a car crash) and ranks as one of the most profoundly moving exercises in catharsis ever recorded, with opening lyrics so emotional, you can't help but be touched by it. The White Album contains some of John's most personal and best songs, which is another reason it is a must-have for any great rock collection. The irony of The White Album is that the best song might be George's. \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", featuring Eric Clapton on lead guitar, is a stunning classic in every sense of the word and only gets better after repeated plays. It is sheer perfection from a guitar and melody standpoint. There is a certain mystique that surrounds The White Album while you're listening to it that the other Beatles albums don't really possess. It's really hard to describe. This is the kind of album that leaves you itchy with anticipation for what will come next and, quite frankly, you can't ask for more out of music than that.kay to me.

031606792X|5.0|It was my real pleasure to read all four \\"Twilight\\" series books in a couple weeks. Now I must say what a captivating, FUN FANTASY TRIP!  (Series personal plus: the oft~cloudy setting in the beautiful jewel green of my northwest backyard.)    I hope that readers will discover, that in all of Ms Meyer's engaging fantasy books, her \\"character-aliens,\\" whether they be awkward teens, vamps, wolves, aliens~E.T. (whatever archetype \\"other\\" may be)--are searching for and do find meanings of love, friends, family, the soul  --and thus their humanity. Delightful discoveries.      \\"Breaking Dawn\\" (and previous three books) has a \\"bite & hooked\\" storyline and charismatic characters for older teens and adults alike --and much more: humor-YES, adventure, tenderness & pain, bonds of love and family, unexpected (?) surprises...and of course, romance.    I highly recommend that you read the first three in the series before Breaking Dawn, as the author gives plot set up for B.D. in the previous three books, as well as in the beginning of BD. (Re-reads are also enlightening!)    Semi-spoiler --I LOVE that Ms Meyer believed that for this Bella/Edward series, the characters and story (romance-adventure ensconced in fantasy/supernatural) could have an optimistic conclusion for this reader--with future story lines potentially and hopefully to resolve. YAY!     And I, as do many, hope that Ms Meyer WILL share more of the Twilight world with us....     PS *****very pleased to see a MAJORITY of 4-5 star book-ratings for BD on all large book seller sites. How wonderful it is that a book creates so much reading & conversation!

B001E75QGG|4.0|yes, this film was probably the weakest of all Indiana Jones films, however it was still a fantastic movie. The people who complain about the film involving aliens are not seeing the point of the movie. George lucas in creating the story is not focusing on the aliens, but in the beliefs and religion of the group of people involved. On top of that you naysayers talk as if Indiana was in the jungle fighting aliens with a blaster which was not the case. People need to learn how too just watch a movie and have fun instead of always looking for a masterpiece. In the end Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a fun adventure film worthy of both Indy and George Lucas.
0307269191|4.0|What I talk about when I talk about running - Haruki Murakami    Theme:  Making best use of ones talents in running as a metaphor for life and especially for running is the main theme of this book. Murakami started running at 33 after realizing that smoking an average of 60 cigarettes a day wasn't doing him any good. Twenty four marathons later and well over fifty years old, he is penning his thoughts on running and the part it plays in his life as an individual and as a writer.    Essentials:  * You have some talents in any sphere - running/writing. You can just do \\"as best as you can\\", by developing endurance and focus, without which one cannot \\"push his possibilities\\".   * Long distance running is an excellent example wherein need for endurance, both during preparation and during the race, is visibly apparent. It is ditto with writing and in general, for most activities in life.  * You should do whatever you want to do irrespective of the talent you have, but be aware that you are only pushing your possibilities.  * You need to be honest about yourself, honest about what you would want to achieve and paddle on to achieve it.  * It is not possible to please everyone, but the key element is to please a few. If you run a Jazz Bar or write a book, you do not expect every visitor or reader to like what you dish out, only a few would. The measure of your success in your professional life is how many of such \\"customers\\" you have and how much joy they derive from your enterprise. Though you'd never realize the extent of it.    Some thoughts  How about walking? Doesn't it achieve all the ingredients of \\"pushing the limits\\" and at the same time permit one to enjoy the places at a much leisurely pace, it is much more natural, remember, as natural as walking! It is therapeutic and maybe meditative as well. Agreed, it is not \\"glamorous\\" or  competitive as running, but it has major plus of being something natural, safe and perfectly healthy activity while permitting one to reach places at a leisurely pace.    P.S  * Somerset Maugham: \\"A philosophy lies in each shave\\": Given enough time and contemplation on single act, the act become deep, acquires a meaning and life of its own. It makes up for a metaphor, maybe a microcosm of life itself.   * We come back to the rebellion of the existential philosophers: it really doesn't matter what one does, except the cadence one does it with. That is the revolt and that is the perhaps the philosophy that Maugham refers to.  * \\"18 till I die\\" (Bryan Adams): Means that you die at 18!
B000O1799U|5.0|\\"Dream Girls\\" is a brilliant, glitzy and thoroughly entertaining production.  The women in the film sparkle with both talent, grace and beauty.  The men, both entertainers and agents, are sleazy enough to want to make you take a good both after watching them.  They are acquisitive, double-dealing and sleazy.  Eddie Murphy as a James Brown surrogate does an especially great job.  Consumed by intemperance and drugs he crashes out before the end of the movie.  It is a little difficult to understand why the female \\"Dreams\\" love these creeps but...hey...it's Hollywood.<br /><br />\\"The Dreams\\" are fairly clearly styled on the \\"Supremes\\" and their music and back up verges on the spectacular.  The choreography is every bit as good as the original 'Supremes\\", maybe better.  Effie, as the not quite so pretty and a little overweight member of the developing group that will become the \\"Dreams\\", is especially good.  Despite the fact that she is the most talented member of the group she is tossed aside because their agent thinks she doesn't fit the beautiful image of the other girls.  We feel her hurt and humiliation as she tries to survive without the music she loves.  Effie, if I'm not mistaken, is an Aretha Franklin type character, not beautiful, perhaps, but a terrific talent.<br /><br />Anyway, most of the scuzzy men in the film are ultimately left in the dust but the glorious 'Dreams' go on to greater glory.<br /><br />Ron
B001E95ZNI|4.0|I went into this film not knowing who directed it... but I love westerns and the cast looked too good to be true. Don't get me wrong: on a whole I loved the movie but I would feel amiss if I didn't bring up the following points. As I was sitting through the film I noticed several awkward moments. Some of these came through weak acting (mostly speaking roles by the thugs that worked for Jeremy Irons), a few over lit or underexposed scenes (one in particular with Ed Harris standing in the swinging doors of the Hotel... and the an earlier one of the main street in town), Timothy Spall's over the top character seemed to be trying too hard: (I love Timothy Spaul; his greatest role in my mind was in Poliakoff's \\"Shooting the Past\\"; he is a brilliant actor and his talents are wasted in these bit parts in American films), Jeremy Irons wrestling with his american accent\\", one white haired gentleman in a black suit and top hat seemed to be walking up the boardwalk in the town in every second scene, and finally... some pregnant pauses in the dialogue leaving the audience hanging. Again; don't get me wrong; I liked the movie but constructive criticism is good. I liken this directing effort by Ed Harris to that of Clint Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" which also had several scenes not lit as well as they could have been. Sure I've been picky here but that is what reviews are for. And hey; this movie offers one of the best one liners in film history destined to go down with Arnold's \\"All be back\\"; it happened when Ed Harris turned around to the prim and proper Renee Zellweger and asked her point blank: \\"Are you a whore?\\"
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Anyone who knows me, knows how big of a Batman fan I am. And even though this may sound biased, I can honestly say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the best comic book adaptation movie ever made! With little nods and sideplots that only us deep Batman fans could recognize (i.e. the sonar spying system that Batman utilizes in the film that is ironically close to the Brother I satellite from the OMAC Project storyline in the comics ([[ASIN:1401208371 The OMAC Project (Countdown to Infinite Crisis)]]), or the Batman wannabe gang that mirrors Frank Miller's \\"[[ASIN:1563899299 Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]\\"), Nolan's \\"Knight\\" brings so much to the table that I can only think that the filmmakers achieved what Raimi so desperately tried to achieve with [[ASIN:B00005JPFH Spider-Man 3 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], only they failed miserably; whereas Nolan and crew made a stunning success!<br /><br />There are so many plotlines in this film, which may make you think that the movie would become convoluted, but it doesn't. If anything, it keeps the audience involved with each and every character all the while keeping them on the edge of their seats, as there are plenty of nailbiting sequences in this film. The main plotline is Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) having to deal with the fact that his persona as Batman has inspired many new acts of criminality -- both seemingly good and extremely bad. Yes, Rachel Dawes is back too. Only instead of Katie Holmes, we now get Maggie Gyllenhaal. I was one of those few when the first film came out that didn't think Holmes' performance was all that bad, but, after seeing Gyllenhaal in this, I now realize how -- although not that bad -- truly stiff Holmes' performance was. And, much to Bruce's chagrin, Rachel's love interest is no other than the compassionate, idealistic District Attorney Harvey Dent (with a performance by Aaron Eckhart that may be the best of his career to date). Of course, Bruce has to deal with this relationship as well (continuing their relationship from [[ASIN:B0017HPHBM Batman Begins (Limited Edition Gift Set)]]), all the while dealing with the newest criminal to grace Gotham's streets -- an anarchistic criminal who simply \\"wants to watch the world burn\\" and calls himself The Joker (Heath Ledger). And the complicated relationship between Gordon, Dent and Batman (another comic book staple) is explored with great writing (again, taking a cue from their relationship in [[ASIN:1563894696 Batman: The Long Halloween]].<br /><br />Now, let me just take this time to say that I'm definitely not one of those people who believes much in an actor or actress receiving awards just because they've passed away or because they're so old and the academies believe they'll be passing away soon (Yes, Martin Landau, for his performance in \\"Ed Wood,\\" I'm directing that statement at him; his performance in that film didn't even come close to Morgan Freeman's in \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\"). However, regardless of Ledger's living status, I can truly say that he deserves an Academy Award for Supporting Actor nomination for his turn as The Joker, dead or alive. He is that good! Of course, being The Joker, he does have a few funny one-liners, however, unlike Jack Nicholson's Joker, Ledger's lines are so creepily delivered that you're not sure whether you want to, or should, laugh. And the complex relationship between The Joker and Batman -- one not being able to exist without the other -- that is a constant in the comics even to this day is added into the movie, which I was delighted about. Also, Ledger's Joker is always one step ahead of Gotham's police and Batman that he makes the perfect formidable foe that us fans know from the comics.<br /><br />Gary Oldman is also back as Lieutenant Gordon, Michael Caine as Alfred, and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox; and all have good screentime and give great performances. Also, for those fans wondering, Cillian Murphy is also back for a brief cameo as The Scarecrow.The performances are all excellent but the true accolades should go to the writers, brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan, and David S. Goyer. They wrote what a Batman movie should be and perfectly showcase why all of us fans love Batman in the first place: the dark, gritty realism peppered with hope and lots of cool gadgets. The fact that director Christopher Nolan has finally brought the cool respect that was lost by his predecessors back to the Batman franchise is superb! The action is plentiful but doesn't take away from the drama that is also needed for a film of this caliber.<br /><br />I liked [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man (Two-Disc Special Collectors' Edition)]] a lot, but The Dark Knight blows it and every other comic book-movie adaptation out of the water! I can only hope that there are more Batman movies planned for Nolan and crew, especially after all the money they've raked in (they broke the record for a midnight opening with $18.6 million, and that's not including any other showings; just the midnight ones)! Whether you're a comic book fan or not, I would recommend this movie! It's probably the best summer blockbuster I've seen in years! Immediately after seeing it, I wanted to see it again and felt bummed out that I couldn't. I won't write any more about the storylines or surprises in store as that would rob you of the full effect of the movie's greatness. Don't read any more into it.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Here is one of the smartest, hilarious movies of the year.<br /><br />The basic plotline:  A smart-mouthed, 16-year-old girl gets pregnant by her geeky, adorable friend.  She goes through a few pregnancy tests, calls up her friend to share her burden, frets for a moment and then bravely takes on the role of being a pregnant high schooler.  Although, the ultimate theme of this film is a teenager dealing with pregnancy, it has a larger theme of the this incredible girl discovering life and love along the journey.<br /><br />The whole movie is carried by this young girl, played by Ellen Page, and Ellen Page deserves all the hype that she got from this movie.  Juno is quirky, smart, sassy, original and adorable and she is played with so much heart.  She may be a teenager but she is a fabulous heroine and one of the most interesting film characters of the recent years.<br /><br />Everyone in the movie is flawlessly casted from Michael Cera, who plays the guy responsible for Juno's pregnancy, to the store clerk who has a two-minute scene in the movie.  I must say, Michael Cera totally brought sexy back in the geeks.<br /><br />Like a good indie film, this movie was definitely anti-hollywood.  The average looking folks were the smarter people and the geek wins the heart of the quirk.  And although it is a comedy with laugh-out-loud dialogue, the movie is incredibly grounded by the solid acting and original script.<br /><br />All in all, a great film experience you wouldn't want to miss.
B000002H38|3.0|I definitely recommend the CD... great music but the seller make sure they are 100% clear with you. It has one scratch on it so it skips on one song. Although i did not pay much, i still would have liked to receive a CD that plays properly!
0399226907|5.0|The classic story about the little catepillar who starts at the beginning of the week as an egg, becames a very hungry catepiller and winds up  as a butterfly.<br /><br />The book helps teach the days of the week, various foods and numbers as the catepillar winds the way through the week before the transformation into thee butterfly.<br /><br />Superb illustrations and colors are appealing and my children as always entertained by this book.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Wonderful job from a real singer. I love singers that can belt out a song and Jennifer can do that as well Aretha, Pattie, Whitney. I don't know why ppl are picking this cd apart I loved absolutly every song.   After the poptarts, the lip syncers, the rebel without a cause pretend angry singers this is a real, real treat. Songs with passion, sung with emotions and real talent. Heck the woman could sing the alphabet song and it would sound good, but she didn't and the songs on this cd are great. Well worth the wait.
0375826726|1.0|I cannot and probably will not finish this book.  I just don't care enough about the characters to try to muddle through this horrible book to find out what happens.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I was amazed at how fast Amazon mailed my CD to me.  The CD it's self is great.  Thank you.
B001BODXVW|4.0|It's a good, honest record that ROCKS! Much like System of a Down records, you would either love it or hate - no middle ground. At times it does sound like SYstem because it has the same rhythm section as SOAD, but otherwise, it's really nice and refreshing. Buy it and play LOUD!
0691126658|5.0|This book really helped me identify birds that I had photographed in Uganda and Rwanda.  The pictures were great as were the descriptions.  I would highly recommend this guide.
1416955070|5.0|After reading a few of the first reviews I'm thinking to myself did I read the same book.  I enjoyed this book from the start.  Clary is a bit childish at first (for lack of a better description).  I liked Jace immediatley and I love Simon.  Isabelle grows on you.  I too am aware that this book has things that have been done before in other books/movies.  However, that's not a bad thing.  I feel this is a page turner and I never found it boring.  I enjoyed the mystery of who is Clary's father, who exactly is Luke and what is going to happen between Simon and Jace and Clary.  I agree it does offer more sexual intentions that most of the \\"children's books\\" I've read but I also was not shocked by it nor do I think this should not be labeled a young adult novel.  This book isn't half as explict as what shows are on main stream television everyday.  As for Alec being gay, so what.  This is written in today's world and I felt it just put a intersting twist on this book.  All in all, I enjoyed this book, it's suggestions, the warlock, the werewolves, the vampires, the characters, the magic, the adventures, and mostly the fantasy mixed with modern day.  Honestly, if you are a teenager, this is G rated compared to your daily life in highschool, I know for me it sure was.  If you want to read a good book, read this book.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Everybody,old and young, needs to buy this cd.Jennifer Hudson has been blessed with an amazing voice with incredible range. Unlike some other reviewers,I feel the selection of tunes on this cd showcase her voice perfectly. Not a bad one in the bunch.They allow her to show her playful,sensual and reverent sides.\\"Spotlight\\" is the new club shaker! She ties the whole experience up by giving praise to her God who has sorely blessed her.Jennifer, you must do a gospel album! It will be a billion seller!Her songs went to my heart and soul.She reminds me of the greatest gospel singer ever,Mahalia Jackson.If they ever do Miss Jackson's story, there's another Oscar in it for Jennifer. Stay strong,Jennifer Hudson.Let your light so shine.
1400032717|3.0|Although a work of fiction, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is a surprisingly insightful journey into the world of one Autistic boy.  A great read for those new to the world of Autism, or looking for a non-technical window into how the disorder could affect one individual. Written with compassion and clarity, it is a quick read, can easily be completed in a day or two, and is suitable for teen readers. I found it to be moving, memorable and somewhat mind-expanding.  Any good book will give you the opportunity to mentally 'try on someone else's shoes', this book will put you inside the mind that many will find unfamiliar, perplexing, perhaps even alien, but not without it's charms.  For those looking for a comprehensive look at Autism, this book will not be a good choice, as Autism spans a vast rainbow of symptoms and behaviors, and this book is written from singular experience.
B00000IHC7|5.0|This is one of my favorite Rory albums.  All the songs are awesome, I expecially like \\"Follow Me\\" and \\"Philby\\".  Rory Gallagher does not have a bad album in his catalog.  For example, I love Dylan but some of his stuff is just not that good ,especially in the mid 80's.  But with Rory no matter which album you buy you'll be happy.  Its too bad he's not around anymore.
0979660742|4.0|Strunk's work is a solid baseline for grammar, punctuation, and composition. If your workplace tends to create its own standards for linguistics, it might be valuable to keep this readily available.<br /><br />It is somewhat limited in terms of all the possible usages of punctuation, and admits as much in its first pages. While this is a valuable reference for most scenarios, it can't stand alone.
B00000G6NI|5.0|Of all the Rory albums, of which you will not find a bad one, Photo Finish is probably the best one from start to finish.  Songs like Shinkicker, Overnight Bag, and Fuel to the Fire are classics.  He is a true genius of guitar and song writing. Rory is one of the few, if not the only, artists that I know of that I cannot point to bad record or a period that wasn't very good.  You will not be disappointed with this album.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|Once upon a time, KOL was the best band out there.  There are very few new bands i listen to as most of them play mainstream relationship BS which i have tried many times to get into but just cant... sort of like nascar. anyway, they are def not the band i saw 3 years ago.. i guess they are trying to get mainstream radio play..  Kaycee L. Craig \\"Kaycee\\" hit it right on the head with their review.  these guys have almost sold out as much as OAR..  anyway, goodbye to a great american band.  This album should have had a picture of a tombstone engraved with \\"Kings of Leon - RIP 2003-2005\\"
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|When I first saw Batman Begins, I told my wife, \\" THIS is how they should make Batman.  Finally, someone knows how to make a damn good superhero movie.\\"  And then when I heard about a sequel (in which I am not surprised given the box office hit of the first) and hoped that it does not dissapoint the first movie.  Lo and behold, it did not.  For me, the sequel/Dark Knight is better than its predecessor.  I told my wife again, \\"Now THIS is how they should make sequels, it's that damn good!\\"  Heath's performance is outstanding.  He brings the Joker's character to a whole new level.  The storyline is great, everything is great.  That is why there is no doubt that the Blu Ray/DVD sale of this movie will definitely surpass Iron Man.  This movie is a must have, especially for hidef fanatics like me.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|This is one of the best CD and DVD's out there!  I love it because this is a lost art of singing the way songs should be sung and lyrics that are clean and all can listen to!  Michael Buble reminds me of a young Frank Sinatra - you can't go wrong with this collection!
0375826726|1.0|Inheritance was supposed to be a trilogy, three books, and now it will be at least four books.  This book was nothing but filler, and has ruined the series.  To me this book was the author or publisher's attempt to cash in on what had been a good series.  Brisingr was 740 pages of boring nothing, only leading to another novel that one can only imagine will be long and boring again.
0525478183|5.0|Paper Towns was a pleasure to read.  It's littered with charm, pop culture, banter, and mystic.  I have to say I was so tempted to turn to page 305 and see what happened in the end because every page was a gripping suspense.    What happened to Margo?   I wanted to know.    But I restrained myself and reading without knowing the outcome was more rewarding.  There are some truths in this book that ring so true for my life and struggles with friends and high school that it could have been my own life, there, on the pages. But it wasn't. Instead it was a story that left me with goosebumps. Besides, my life could never be quite as clever. :P  There were some parts that I was unimpressed with. The emphasis of Walt Whitman's poem was very overplayed. I especially hated the fact that I was spoon fed it's meaning as it fit to the book. I found there was a too heavy reliance on 'Song of Myself'. It made the story drag.  However, the character interactions, the laugh out loud wit of dialog, and the quirky bits of a true imagination redeemed the book.  So I recommend it. In fact. I recommend all of Mr. Green's novels because he's truly brilliant. :)
0743289692|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali takes the reader on a journey. A journey of discovery from obscurity to fame, from the muslim brotherhood to atheism, from the backbreaking yokes of third world tribalism and feudalism to Western philosophy and the Enlightenment.  Ms. Ali did not intend for this to happen. It all happened TO her, and she lays out her case for turning her back on her family, her cultural heritage and her religion in a brutally honest, often heart-wrenching manner.  If the West has any doubts about what the leaders of the Islamic world are up to, they should be put to rest after reading this book.  Islam is not a curious group of friendly, smiling, quaintly dressed members of the local mosque just down the block.   It is an insidious disease that is slowly spreading throughout the world. Just as any dictatorial regime will maintain that its mission is peace and harmony with all men, Ms. Ali warns us not to be fooled by any faux ecumenism coming from muslim leaders.  As she points out, the Koran is clear, Islam is man's only hope for salvation.  And you shall either believe or be cut down by the sword of Islamic justice.  Muslims do not wish to live peacefully side by side with members of other religions. Muslims cannot tolerate Western freedoms and values at all.  The only coexistence muslims are interested in is the one where they are in charge. And it is the duty of every muslim to ensure the coming of this new Caliphate. Read Ms. Ali's book and learn the truth about the Islamic agenda from a woman who has traveled farther than most of us on her journey of discovery.  Discover her passion, and discover the truth.
0575081406|5.0|Let me just say that this book is a work of genius.  It is really all you need to entertain yourself for a while.  The story is so good and just keeps getting better as you read, through all 700 pages.  At the end I literally felt like I wanted to read about 2000 pages more of it.  And for anyone who starts reading now, you don't have very long to wait for the second book.  Believe me, you WILL be waiting for the second book.
B000050FEN|5.0|This isn't just another thriller. This one deals with psychology, philosophy, and the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy). This one shakes you to the bone (it really works as a top-rate thriller). The acting, the cinematography, the minimal music, and the urban setting are amazing. And you'll be rightfully shocked at what happens in the end. ****1/2 out of *****.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|In several recent reviews, I've read Only By the Night decried as being \\"too commercial\\" or \\"too polished\\" and \\"straying too far from the Kings' signature sound\\". After a few listens, I've got to disagree with all of the above. As for the popular commercial appeal of this record, there is perhaps only one rock radio friendly single on this album and it's already peaked. \\"Sex on Fire\\" has been the Kings' most successful single to date. It has also been their most controversial, as far as their \\"old\\" fans are concerned.    \\"Sex of Fire\\" may not be the most sophisticated song, lyrically or musically, but neither were the Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" or Jerry Lee Lewis' \\"Great Balls of Fire\\". It's just a darn good, darn catchy straight up rock 'n' roll song. Furthermore, it's no more commercial than their last album's first single, \\"On Call\\"- arguably more of a departure from the Kings' established, musically raw style. Why folks get upset when a nominal indie band has a successful single that gets significant airplay on corporate rock radio is something that I can't quite understand. This is not arena rock, in a pejorative sense, at least. The Kings have not become the American Coldplay.    Yes, Only By the Night is slightly more polished and perhaps more melodic, in a conventional sense, than the King's earlier albums, but it still features the King's musical trademarks: alternating rambling and cyclical song structures, non-virtuoso guitar solos (not necessarily a bad thing), and a truly unique and unaffected vocal style. The album isn't more commercial, it's more accessible. Yes, they've attempted to add a few sonic layers to several of the songs, Closer first and foremost among them. For the most part, this experiment has paid off. Closer, in particular, achieves a \\"spooky\\" atmospheric quality unprecedented in the Kings' back catalogue.     I've read Crawl described as \\"Zepplinesque\\" but it sounds nothing like a Page/Plant creation. Instead, it calls to mind the Secret Machines' debut's throbbing synth/base loops. It is a propulsive song, chugging along like a runaway freight train rolling down the tracks at a leisurely 30mph- it doesn't move too fast, but you still can't stop it.    \\"Use Somebody\\" is perhaps the most poppy tune on the album. Once again, this is not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Revelry\\" is perhaps the most melodic song on the album, if not the band's entire catalog. \\"Manhattan\\" too, is quite tuneful, if a bit more uptempo. \\"17\\" is probably the least sophisticated song on the record, lyrically at least, but it isn't unbearably so. Like most of the songs on this record, there is something strangely catchy about it. That, however, does not mean that the record is poppy. Its not.     My least favorite song on Only By The Night is \\"Be Somebody\\" which tends to ramble in a bad way. It is a Frankenstein's monster of several disparate hooks, the sum being less than its parts. However, this song is the only one of the album's 11 tracks that I'm ever tempted to skip. The last song on the album is the bleak but pretty \\"Cold Desert\\", a strong down-tempo finisher.    Adding a few keyboards and studio effects to the holy rock trinity of guitar, drums, and base is not a cardinal sin but the Kings are taking a licking from many critics and hipsterm fans for attempting to, rather modestly, broaden their sound. These attacks are unfair. I'm not comparing Only By the Night to either of these two albums but I wonder if the critics and fans complained that Sgt. Peppers or Pet Sounds were over produced or strayed too far from their respective creators' earlier works. More recently, even the rock minimalist Jack White has been experimenting with different arrangements, instruments, and overdubs on the last two White Stripes albums and, for the most part, received nothing but critical praise for it (if perhaps less commercial success than his previous releases).     Only By the Night is an attempt at musical growth. Maybe commercial success in America was a major motivator, but so what? The end result certainly justifies the means. And you've got to give these guys credit. Five strong albums in almost as many years is a rare achievement in this musical day and age. The fact that all of the Kings are under 30 years of old promises great things. Expect their next to be a musical masterpiece. In the meantime, enjoy Only By The Night for what it is- a pretty darn good album.
0393312836|5.0|I say complicated because of the language that's found throughout the novel. The entire book is written in first person, and we focus on Alex, whose language will be really hard for some people to get into. But if you read it the second or third time, then you'll understand what's happening and what the characters are trying to say.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess's philosophical novel is a must-read. It deals with modern society and government experiments. Basically, the book discusses the idea of driving a criminal away from crime, but \\"at what cost?\\" Many scenes involving rape and violence are especially disturbing (I imagine that Stanley Kubrick's film version is just as gruesome). And the government testing scenes are fairly frightening. The last chapter of this book (the 21st) is now restored, as it has been omitted the first time this was published in the States. It's somewhat controversial, but I won't give you the details, you'll have to read it yourself.<br /><br />A-
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Rockferry by Duffy is a cool and unique album from this sassy singer/songwriter. Duffy has a very strong and soulful voice, a lot of people have compared her to Dusty Springfield. The melodies and lyrics are pretty and simple, songs like Warwick Avenue, Mercy, Hanging On Too Long, I'm Scared, and Stepping Stone are some of the standouts. The opener, Rockferry is probably the strongest of the bunch. The closer, Distant Dreamer is optimistic and lush with a variety of instruments that fit perfectly with Duffy's vocals. I wasn't expecting much from this album, I was pleasantly surprised with how much talent this gal actually has. Buy it today!
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors being the doors 1967 release and their debut album. On this record we get many gems. For instance it starts out with a bang with the amazing track Break on through, and then later Light my fire and the strange track the end. Elektra has produced a very sparse but ok book-let. No lyrics inside. Some very 60's looking photos that look very similair to what other artists did at the same time. The lyrics are sometimes very strange. 5/5!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|This movie is excellent, and love Tim Burton's film. Great movie for kids and adults, very educational. Animation is awesome and very realistic. Would recommend for the entire family.
B00026WUAU|4.0|Street Legal being Dylan's 1978 record and his 18th release as artist is a very good album. This album in question was a major musical departure for Dylan. This is the first album in which he utilizes a large pop-rockband complete with female backing singers. One can not get stuck in a rut and I think it was a bold move. The book-let contains no lyrics which is a shame. It does have a list of who plays what and that is very nice. To imagine that he paid a photographer for the front cover is a puzzle. It is simple snap shot of Bob standing near a flight of stairs. Joel Bernstein must be a good friend since the inside is a travesty. Even so songs like Is your love in vain?, Changing of the guards are very good.  I can not understand why on earth this album got such negative reviews in America but was generally liked in Europe. This not amazing album but good enough to get 4/5!
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Guess, I'll finally weigh in on this one.  Halloween is a perfect product of it's time and the fact that it was actually scary allows it to continue to live on all these years later.  The cast is perfectly awkward, the scares numerous, the soundtrack exceptional, and the nostalgia brilliant.  Every year, after we've killed -- er, I mean fed --the last trick-or-treaters, we settle in for this fabulous, low-budget gem. It deserves it's status among fright films.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Zeitgeist being the latest release from Smashing Pumpkins is an alright release that gets a bit too political. It seems like almost all major artists do it these days. Madonna on Hard Candy, Sherryl Crow on Detours and now Smashing Pumpkins on Zeitgeist. To be honest it sounds just as trite, forced and pretentious when either of them do it.  To think that this the same group the recorded Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness with truly classic tracks as \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" or \\"1979\\" makes it painfully clear that this is not their best work.  Even if one compares with the earlier \\"Siamese Dreams\\" then one is reminded that they can do so much better then this. \\"Doomsday Clock\\" is an ok but it lacks the SP aura of earlier releases. 3/5.
0394800192|5.0|This book was on a request list for my daughter's kindergarten class.  We took the book in as a gift to the class on her birthday.  I read it to the class and they loved it.
B0000024W3|4.0|Self Portrait being Dylan's 10 the studio album and was released in 1970 by Columbia Records is a really odd record of Dylan. It consists mostly of covers well-known folk and pop songs. At the time this was a very controversial move. People wanted him to continue to be a spokesman for the generation.  Many people wanted him and expected him to continue angry social and anti-war songs and when this album was released they were incensed. I do not understand this at all. Did they expect just to be their puppet spokesman? I really do not understand why I was given such bad reviews. The singing is as good as ever and it is refershing to hear non-political songs from Dylan. After all, there is a thin line between being a spokesman for a generation and a person that has a severe case of hubris. The cover is terrible and looks like a 5 year old created this painting. Dylan must have been really drunk when he made this selfportrait.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been a speed metal fan since the 80s when Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth ruled my world.  This album is a masterpiece that incorporates all the best hooks and themes from previous efforts.  My previous favorite was Ride the Lightning.  Death Magnetic feels every bit as powerful as that epic, and...dare I say it...I think it's better!  Thank you Metallica! These days it is so hard to be impressed with a new disc, or listen to something over and over again and enjoy it more each time.  Even more impressive, and a near impossibility when picking up a CD these days, is that every track simply ROCKS.  One more note I forgot to mention; Jason Trujillo is a perfect fit for the band.  Excellent choice.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Hard Candy being Madonna's latest release is an ok release that is neither really bad or all that good either. I did not expect Confessions part II, knowing that Madonna likes to change her music and image for every record she releases. This time it just does not work all that well. Whilst it worked like a charm with William Orbit. This time around with Timbaland it sounds uninspired many times. 4 minutes, Give it 2 me are great tracks. However, to much Timbaland just gets, well not that fun. As for the book-let. Well Madonna looks even more plastic then usual. That outfit is not especially flattering. No lyrics and the rest of the information is basically impossible to read. I expected a lot more from this and therefore I give it 3/5!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|In the last scene of \\"Batman Begins\\" Batman flips over a card & it turns out 2 B The Joker Card. After I saw that scene I thirsted 4 a sequal. Everyday I ran 2 the computer 2 C who they cast as The Joker. Then the Big news had been revealed; The Joker was going 2 B played by Heath Ledger. I as many fans out their back then really didn't know what 2 think(In fact I was somewhat disappointed). It wasn't until I saw the 1st trailer 4 the movie that I started jumping off the walls & began counting down the days till the film's release.   Then Heath died. I as many fans out there mourned his death & wondered what would happen 2 \\"The Dark Knight.\\" WB'S gave everybody a sign of relief when they said that the movie was going in2 post production & that the film was set 2 B released as scheduled. After I saw the film Iron Man I began 2 wonder how \\"The Dark Knight\\" was going 2 top this. I found out the day of its release.   1st off the movie leaves U (@ each & every moment) on the edge of your seat (Literally I thought I was going 2 fall off my chair). The chase scenes w/ Batman & the Bat-pod were superb, & The cast was terrific.   Christian Bale still continued 2 prove that he was the greatest Batman of all time & gave a stunning performance as both Bruce Wayne & Batman. Aaron Eckhart gave a gr8 performance as Harvey Dent, & gave a chilling performance as Two-Face (which made Tommy Lee Jone's performance in \\"Batman Forever\\" look really Bad). Gary Oldman continued to WOW me as Lieutenant James Gordon (who later becomes Commisioner), & Maggie Gyllenhal took on the role of Rachel Dawes (which was 1st played by Katie Holmes).   However, the performance that I think stole the show was Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. Now I loved Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Tim Burton's 1989 film \\"Batman,\\" however, Heath's Joker made Jack's look like one of those clowns that entertains @ children's B-day parties. This Joker was dark, extremely disturbed & loved 2 cause chaos in Gotham by Blowing up a hospital in a nurse's outfit (LOL), poisoning the police commisioner w/ sulfuric acid, making a \\"Pencil disappear,\\" & blowing up the building of the MCU w/ a bomb implanted inside of another prisoner. This Joker also looked very different he had long greasy green hair, he had a carved smile on his face, & his makeup looked as if it had been applied & not like he had fallen in2 a vat of chemicals. Heath's joker also symbolized the joker that is in the comics 2day; he has no backstory(although U find out bits & pieces of his backstory in the scenes he's in) doesen't have a real name, has an extremely creepy laugh, is more crazy than ever, & he gets the last laugh.   The movie is centered around 3 characters; Batman, Gordon, & Harvey Dent. The Joker then sets his sights out on all 3 men but especially Harey Dent & (in a way)turns Harvey in2 Two-Face which leads in2 an emotional confrontation Btween these characters. This movie also makes Bruce Wayne/Batman face the question if he is doing any good in Gotham or is he responsible 4 the chaos that The Joker is causing. Bruce even considers turning himself in2 the police. Oh, & 2 people die in this movie (can't say who).   Its been 2 months since the films release & it has made over 500 million dollars (beating all Star Wars films WOW) but still comming short 2 Titanic. A sequal may be comming soon but 2 me it really doesen't matter 2 me if they make a sequal or not. This film unlike \\"Batman Begins\\" doesen't make U want a sequal. It ends in a very concluding way.   Now I know I just wasted a whole page writing about this movie but now all I have 2 say is; YOU HAVE 2 SEE THIS MOVIE PREORDER IT NOW WHAT R U WAITING 4?
0399215980|2.0|This book is smaller than a postcard, it is very hard for any early reader to decode the words with such a small print and not even talk about reading it to a group of children (that is what i wanted to do). I'm returning it.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|If your a Big Metallica Fan, your going to love this album! If you lost intrest after the Black Album, then you wont get this one either!<br />I personaly enjoy their music and am a huge fan but they could have really took time and put the heart and soul in the last four albums as they did in the past. Big business has had them pushed since the Black Album and has hurt them in the creative department. I still love their work and plan to mix these songs with the last 3 albums.....sanitarium!
B000063DI9|5.0|This is one of my favorite Iron Maiden albums. The musical qualities are definitely there. The lyrics are insightful as well. Not a bad moment to be had on this disk. Up the Irons!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I had no idea there was so much history to this group.  No wonder I loved it at first play!  W.A.S.P. member, Pantera sound...I thought I was going crazy.  I'm a true 80's chick, GNR, Iron Maiden rock and when I bought this album I was really amazed that it suited me just fine.  It is truly heavy but heavy in an understandable way.  Buy it!  Can't wait to hear their other stuff now.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|This album pales in comparison to Slipknot and Iowa. They sold out and it is too soft and slow for my tastes. Their old stuff was good but this has too much singing and mainstream tendencies. Ill pass. This album made me not like them any more. They went from being a metal band to a softcore metal band that even nonmetal people started getting into. People tell me how great Slipknot is yet they don't know what their old stuff is like. Numetal bands sell out after only a few years. I wish bands these days had more integrity. -Dre
B001BGTWXI|4.0|I've never listened to Slipknot before but after hearing Psychosocial on the radio I went out and bought the cd.  I loved it!  It's heavy, lyrics are good, bass is there...I haven't heard their previous stuff yet but I will definitely be exploring their older music now.  If you're looking for a good head-banging album, this is it.  I think the band is incredibly talented and the songs show their diversity.  Lots of heavy bands don't really have true vocal capabilities so it was surprising to find out that Slipknot does.  I would recommend this album - can't criticize their other stuff 'cause I haven't heard it yet so if anyone else out there is new to the band like me go for it.
0670019933|5.0|I already owned this book in paperback and loved it ... treated myself to a special hardback version.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I listened to Bad Girlfriend while getting a tattoo this summer and thought it was a fun song and wanted to hear more Theory so I bought this album.  It's fun summer music and beyond.  Not heavy death metal but a good outgrowth of 80's metal for those of us that were there.  The lyrics are kind of all over the place...half the album is about love lost and the other about love found and that's pretty annoying but the tempo stays jammin' and you'll really enjoy it.  I liked this album much better than their previous ones.
0312857063|5.0|Very well written series. Terry Goodkind is a spellbinding writer, who keeps you wanting more.  Once you pick the first novel, there's no stopping until you reach the eleventh. I'm on the eighth book now and can't put it down.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I have numerous happy memories of seeing Mary Poppins since the first time (on its re-release in 1980). I go back to it time and again and have never been bored yet!  Highlights - the horse race and the dancing cartoon waiter penguins; Chim Chim Chiree and the acrobatic chimney sweeps; Mrs Banks (Glynis Johns) and her 'Votes for Women'; Reginald Owen's Admiral (with a ship on the roof of his house!); the gorgeous 'Feed the Birds'; the special effects in 'A Spoonful of Sugar'; Ed Wynn as the giggling Uncle Albert; and of course the brilliant performances from Julie Andrews as Mary, Dick van Dyke as Bert/Mr Dawes senior, Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber as the children Jane and Michael, Hermoine Baddeley as the maid, and David Tomlinson as Mr Banks.  Absolutely brilliant and definitely makes you remember being a child with a big smile on your face. Those who don't like it possibly came to it too late in life, but I can't fault it.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|discovering yourself, coming out, a sweet love story and the variability of \\"family\\" -- truly well acted, a first rate production that could find a wider audience.
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Forget the armchair critics.  If you're a Disney fan. you'll love this one, about a Chinese girl who joins the army to fight maurading Huns. There's a little dragon friend (Eddie Murphy), a romantic captain of the guard (Donny Osmond provided the singing voice), an evil-looking Hun chieftain, an irritating minister and 3 soldier friends.  Despite what others may say, the songs are terrific - not soul (ala Hercules) or jazz (ala Jungle Book), just normal. It's not a kiddies' film - it's for the whole family.  Frankly, I'm not really a Disney fan and have little patience to watch most animated films. But this one's worth it.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|This is one of those albums that can only be fully appreciated on vinyl. The sound quality is phenomenal!
B000JVSUS4|4.0|All right I know that Pearl Harbor since its release date has been getting nothing but horrible reviews from just about every critic who'd seen it. I personally thought it was an excellent movie. The authenticity of every thing about the film was almost down to a science. Aside from Ben Affleck's 90's style haircut everything from clothing to wall posters were all well placed and everything.  Now we come to the acting. Every one in the film did a great job portraying their charecters and making them seem real. The only real problem I noticed in the acting was Ben Affleck's southern accent. I've got nothing against Ben Affleck, in fact I think he's a very good actor it's just that he'd have done a much better job with his charecter if he'd just not used an accent.  And last but not least, the bombing sequence. This was absolutely the best aspect of the film. The second the first bomb falls, you'll be on the edge of your seat. Not only that but the scenes where the Japanese were planning the attack were awesome. All in all this is a must see of a film.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is a very funny comedy. Fantastic, wonderful and it also has some serious parts. I really enjoyed! I wish I could find more comedies like this one. Highly recommended.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Blu-ray owners finally got their wish, \\"Batman Begins\\" comes to the format.  It looks great and Dolby TrueHD soundtrack rumbles with clarity.  Watching and listening to the 'Tumbler' in action is amazing.      BUY IT!!! You will not be disappointed.     Plus...the blu-ray gets \\"The Dark Knight\\" Prologue, the first 6 minutes of possibly the best movie of all time.
B0016NF06O|5.0|i love both willie and wynton. they did an excellent job playing together and sharing the lime light.
0439023483|5.0|The best indicator of a good \\"teen fiction\\" book is an appeal to adults.  I enjoyed this story and my teen years are 30 years behind me.<br /><br />Others have detailed the story, so I won't elaborate, but suffice it to say that I have always enjoyed science fiction and this book did not disappoint.  Suzanne Collins has created a believable future and the characters felt honest and real.<br /><br />I'm anxiously awaiting the next book in this series.
0307269752|4.0|The 100-page prologue almost did me in.  Because the book had so much positive hype I slogged on, hoping the book would redeem itself.  Since our main character is a journalist specializing in the world of finance, the reader is subjected to a very dull, painstaking description of the business world of Sweden. Yawn!  Then the \\"cast of thousands\\" is introduced.  Confusion!<br /><br />But just when I was ready to pack it in at the end of the prologue, the storytelling improves dramatically.  It is almost as if another author takes over the book. I think the prologue material would have been better served up in flashbacks.<br /><br />The title features the most interesting character in the book: Lisbeth, the girl with the dragon tattoo.  Her mind may work differently, but ultimately it is a gift that allows her to see more clearly than the conventional thinkers around her.  Unfortunately the view she sees is the dirty underbelly of Swedish culture.  I can't wait to read more about her in the rest of the trilogy.<br /><br />I think the glimpse into Sweden, a milieu I have rarely encountered in novels, was the second most interesting thing about the book.  The author skillfully transported me to Hedeby Island where the landscape is an integral part of the story.<br /><br />In spite of the dreary prologue, the rest of the book was an unexpected romp, full of plot developments that were true surprises.  For this reason I give it four stars.
B001DDBCUK|4.0|This was the only film I saw this summer on the big screen and perhaps that's why I found it an initial disappointment. (I don't get out much). I think it was impossible to live up to all the hype associated with the opening. Having forgotten about it, I received the DVD as a gift and was reluctant to watch it again. But I'm certainly glad I did. With lowered expectations, I found this to be an enjoyable visit with the glamorous New York characters, Carrie Bradshaw, Samantha Jones, Miranda Hobbs and Charlotte York Goldenblatt.<br /><br />Make no mistake, above all else this is a fashion show. (A bright blue Manolo Blahaik with a five-inch heel is even used in place of a diamond ring). When the show was still on television I used to say my favorite part about it was the writing with fashion a close second. For the film it was the other way around. Because the characters are so well known their behaviors and lines at times come off as clich&eacute;. There is, however, the occasional surprise with some laugh-out-loud lines and some highly emotional moments. True fans of the show will definitely feel it's worth the watch.<br /><br />What I liked best about this film is the focus on RELATIONSHIPS (on several levels) and how they evolve. I believe the whole concept of the Sex and the City industry is that even the most fanciful characters face real-life problems . . . it's just that these ladies look really gooooooood while they do.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of [[ASIN:1932172300 It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club]].
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this album and yes, it is past the lust stage. I simply can not stop listening to this album.  \\"Flume\\" and \\"Skinny Love\\" are my personal favorites but this is one of those albums where you dont really want to skip and you can listen to over and over.  You will thank yourself for checking this out.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This CD is everything I hoped for.   I love country music, but wasn't into it when Garth came on the scene.....can't believe I missed all those years!!!  Listen to it all the time.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|i was super excited to pick this one up and did so on the second day of its release. i knew from the start that it was gonna be much better than st. anger (disliked that one very much esp w/lars' horrible drumming IMO). but i had doubts also...subconsciously comparing Death Magnetic to old metallica albums such as the black album, justice, and master, which i love.    i can't say i'm disappointed; i can't say i'm very impressed either. even though the sound is much more 80's tallica than load or reload, i feel like the guys tried way too hard, which can be a bad thing sometimes. the songs that stuck out IMO are suicide & redemption and end of the line, and 1 or 2 others. still, however, the riffs are very nice. the singing...not so much...it's a little...awkward, for a lack of a better word.    i love metallica's ballad-ish songs such as nothing else matters, the unforgiven, one, fade to black, sanitarium. but unfortunately, the day that never comes and unforgiven III did not exactly live up to the reputation. they all started out amazing. then...ehhhh..got messy and, not so good. the fact that \\"the day\\" sounds like a rip off of \\"one\\" really bothers me.     overall, i thought Death Magnetic was decent. not a masterpiece but pretty good on the whole. someone who's into the thrashy and rawly produced sound will like this one. for me, i'm more of a black album person. i guess that makes all the difference.
0375826726|4.0|I am in my mid 30's and started reading Eragon to my daughters who are now 7 and 12 years old. I found myself really enjoying the book. I finished Eragon and then read Eldest shortly after it came out. I am now almost done with Brisinger. I have enjoyed all three books very much. I disagree with some of the comments about the books being too similar to the Lord of the Rings.. I love the LOTR books and films very much and I am a huge fan, but besides the books having dwarfs, humans and elves his series is nothing like LOTR.. It is the story of a boy becoming a hero.. I fell in love with the characters in the book..Eragon, Roran, Sapharia and many more. I like the books and I am thrilled that the series is not actually over since it was suppose to be a trilogy but it will go beyond that.. I love the story and can't wait for the fourth , maybe longer series.. Keep up the great work Paolini.. I would rather have quality that quantity... It doesn't matter how long the series take.. It is worth it...

B0012CJQY6|5.0|This show redefined television. What The Sopranos did for changing the way we look at the mafia, The Shield did for cops. Vic Mackie is the very definition of moral ambiguity. Almost gives a wild west feel to modern day law enforcement. Vic, Shane, Lem, and Ronnie enforce their own brand of justice. These guys are definite mavericks, and this show is definitely a phenomenal achievement in television history.
B001B6K2TG|5.0|Wynton Marsalis and Willie Nelson, Master in each of their Music categories; have joined forces in a New Orleans-Kind-Of-Way to create a;Believe it or not; Blues recording Masterpiece. Willie's Voice  and choice of material(which is perfect for this CD) is perfectly accented by the down home New Orleans horn sounds of Wynton. A modern Laided Back Blues Classic that should be nominated for a Grammy!
0679847367|5.0|This classic Dr. Seuss book is not just for kids. It's probably not even especially for kids. This classic book is the perfect gift for transitions: graduation, weddings, adoptions (my favorite paired with Dr. Seuss's \\"Horton Hatches An Egg\\"), new job, getting fired from a horrible job, ....)<br /><br />And this deluxe edition is especially perfect for that gift at a special landmark occasion.<br /><br />Ted Geisel might have crafted a book that gets shelved in the Children's Section in libraries and book stores, but he was writing especially to those of us who periodically forget, and want or need to remember, how magical and special every day of life can be.
B001DDBCUU|4.0|Yes, it's been half a decade and yes, they have grown up. Thankfully! The characters are being revisited but they have also changed, expanded. Their essence is there but their conflicts are brand new.<br />It doesn't feel like we're getting a special episode, it does feel like we're getting a movie (some would argue we're getting two movies - and indeed, the tone does change a lot halfway through, and the movie is a bit too long).<br />As for the extras, I would have been happy if there were more interviews with the other members of the cast. There's a nice conversation w/ SJP and the director, but we want more! The extras for the special edition are pretty plain (and few) considering they have gotten a whole DVD for them.<br />In the end, I do recommend the film, even if you never saw the show (like myself, when I first watched it in theatres). You may just fall in love with it and become so addicted that you'll buy the 6 seasons and watch them in a month or so... just like I did.
B000050X31|5.0|For me, the beauty of this Met production was every aria Kathleen Battle participated in.  I've read all the stories about her arrogance and general over-the-top \\"diva-ness\\", but she certainly has an amazing voice.  I've not heard a better Pamina.  She brought tears to my eyes.    Manfred Hemm's Papageno is wonderfully acted.  He charms the audience and extracts maximum effect from the comedic portions of his part.    This is by far the finest \\"Flute\\" production I've seen and heard.
1592332803|5.0|I am new to the vegan world and changing my diet hasn't been as difficult as changing the family's.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Very Good But not as good as batman begins,everyone is saying how terrific this movie is but its only because of heath ledgers death.
B00192KCQ0|1.0|This is the worst sounding album I have EVER heard!! I have shellac 78's from 1910 that have more fidelity than this!! Even in my car it sounds horrible!! It is brick walled to the max! No dynamic range!! It is insufferable to listen to! Don't waste your money.
0385733577|5.0|Interesting story. I picked it up in the library and read it from cover to cover. It reminds me of Harry Potter.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|the tuner is very easy to operate, can be used inline with an amp, in bypass mode, or just the guitar and tuner. it also has various tuning options for guitar, chromatic, bass, etc... does the job for me and at a very affordable price.
B000IMV4IW|1.0|Does the band have any input in this. My first complaint is each disc only has nine tracks. Why not fill it up? Stop Crying My Heart Out should be on there as well as Do You Know What I Mean? There was at least seven other tracks they could have included. Why release two discs with nine tracks only on them? It makes no sense.
0440243661|5.0|This was my favorite of the Jack Reacher series and also the most heartbreaking.  For those of you who have read \\"The Enemy\\" and are familiar with his colleagues, helpers, and enemies, this would really make you  furious. I especially hated the killers who caused Franz' dog to die. I am always amazed when I think of how Lee Child does his research.
B000U7SN8O|5.0|As far as lo-fi goes, this took the sub-genre in a whole new direction. Not for everyone, and you'll be hard-pressed to find hit single potential in any of these early 90's noise pop-rock confections, but the lyrics are strong, with a strong Anne Frank theme throughout. If you enjoy this kind of music, you will fall in love with this album. It's as simple as that!
B0017I1FO4|4.0|I saw Shinedown on Jay Leno, and it isn't often that a band impresses me.  I bought the CD and am very pleased with it.  Of course, there are a few songs I don't particularly care for, but the majority of them are really great.  I'm glad I made the (small) investment for the CD.  It was certainly worth it.
0375826726|5.0|Brisingr, in my opinion, was the best book in the Inheritance cycle by Christopher Paolini so far.    It's about the Dragon Rider, Eragon, and his dragon Saphira, who are destined to defeat the dark king and free all of Alagaesia from his evil rule. But Eragon is bound by numerous promises: his fealty to Nasuada, his promise to help his cousin save his betrothed from the Ra'zac, and his loyalty to the elves and to the dwarves. Therefore, he has to listen to and carry out orders from each without disappointing the others. Saphira and Eragon have to go to their two mentors in the land of the elves to learn the how the dark king and his servant, Murtagh, a new Rider under his power, have managed to become so strong.    If you liked the Lord of the Rings series, then you'll probably like the Inheritance cycle as well. They seem to be set around the same time period, and are similar in the style of writing, which is slightly old fashioned. That creates a slightly more difficult book to read.     In this book, Paolini provides some clues that let the reader start guessing as to how the story will unfold.  You learn a lot more about the characters' personalities and how they might react in a certain situation. There's lots and lots of suspense; I found myself holding my breath more than a few times while I was reading, and read for so long one day I couldn't really see when I took the book away from my face...I liked how all the sad parts were actually sad; I started crying when I read most of them which, in a weird kind of way, is sort of nice. All the characters are likeable and believable, even the villains. They're the kind of bad guys you love to hate.      Paolini weaves an intricate web of characters and plot lines, connecting everything so that you have to read the book two or three times before you can grasp everything within it.  Brisingr is a rich, captivating and complicated book that holds your attention until the very last page.  I absolutely suggest this series to anyone who likes to curl up with a blanket on a rainy day with a good book.    Happy Reading!!
B001CEC1E6|5.0|then you probably already know. Volbeat Rules! This is along the lines of the first two albums, but with the addition of some gang vocals and the occasional female voice harmonizing. Also the guitar solos are featured more. Basically, all of the cool stuff plus more cool stuff. I'm about to lose my freakin' mind here! This entire album is killer. I'm not joking! Buy it at any price you can get it. It's worth it!!!
B0000046KM|5.0|The late Shirley Horn made a grand comeback when she reappeared on the Verve label and from them on it was pure bliss.  That same word could apply to this Grammy winning album, her first ever with the impeccable Johnny Mandel creating gossamer arrangements for La Horn!! This was a match made in heaven for Shirley and Johnny Mandel  much like Cole and Riddle or Riddle and Sinatra or Miles & Gil--you knew when these two got together that great music would occur.  Of course Mandel has arranged for other artists as well like Sinatra, Tony Bennett or Natalie Cole but I believe that it was destiny that Shirley would choose him for this album and that it was no accident that it won an Grammy.  Every track on this CD is pure heaven and if you ever feel depressed or just bummed out--put this one on (you won't regret it).  We'll all miss Shirley--I saw her many years ago at Yoshi's in Oakland and she was as unforgettable and warm as this recording is.  She was definitely like Paul Newman-- one of a kind!!
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|saw adele features on a music channel as an up and comer and loved chasing pavements. for 10 bucks i thought what the heck and bought it. i am so glad i did. she is bluesy, charming and it just a nice change from what is being out out there in the music world. i highly recommend it.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is a fabulous movie, so it is gratifying to see an edition that provides a full menu of features to compliment the film. Filled with behind-the-scenes features and extras, plus a digital disc and a fabulous edition of the movie itself.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love Big Bang Theory and watch it religiously on TV.  It is one of the few half hour comedies that is funny without being crass or over the top.  You sympathize with the awkwardness of the geeks and understand the frustration of the \\"girl next door\\" who tries to socialize them.  I recommend this series for all ages and IQs!
B000H3096A|5.0|It's a toss up as to which album is the better of Hutcherson-Hancock colloborations (I also dig him with McCoy Tyner as well), this one or \\"Oblique\\" which was recorded 2 yrs later. It would probably be this one since I've worn out the record several times and now have played the CD more times than \\"Oblique\\".  Certainly the selection of tunes like the Satie-like \\"Bouquet\\" or \\"When You are Near\\" bring out the beauty of Hutch's vibes.  And let us not forget the latin-tinged \\"Rojo\\" or the modal tunes such as Hancock's \\"Maiden Voyage\\" and Hutcherson's \\"Aquarian Moon\\".  All in all a classic album with the superb drumming of Joe Chambers!!
B0002A2WDQ|3.0|Ralph Macchio, (best known from the Karate Kid) plays a classical guitar virtuoso at Julliard School for the Performing Arts in Brooklyn, NY.  His talent is classical music but his love is for the Blues.  He befriends an old, broken-down man blues and alleged cohort of Robert Johnson, living in a New York retirement home.  This movie takes the Robert Johnson myth to another level suggesting that Mr. Johnson's friend, \\"Blind Dog\\" Fulton/Willie Brown also did business with the devil.  Ry Cooder, the genius musician and producer, performs the blues music.  Steve Vai, lead guitarist for David Lee Roth, makes a cameo.  This was overall a great film with several good Blues performances.  The acting was very solid.  I recommend this film.
B000002B35|5.0|Of the various Floyd albums that have been released, I believe this is the definitive! Even though Waters is not present for this album, the performances are stunning. Coupled with both the sound of new Floyd and old Floyd, Pulse adds many new songs to their list of recorded performances (including a full live version of DSOTM). If you are a fan of Floyd, I strongly recommend this album!    p.s. try to get the original release, the LED just blinks on and on and on...
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|I stumbled upon Joshua Radin's music and ended up buying \\"We Were Here\\". The music is slow, and somewhat sad, so you want to be in the right mood to listen to it (although I listen to it whenever), but it's great music.
0385340990|5.0|A delightful book with something for everyone: WWII, a little known island, interesting people, romance - even food (or lack of it in this instance)! I'm not a great fan of epistolary novels - novels written in the form of letters - but here the genre works just fine, a natural choice in the circumstances. I was fascinated at how deftly characters are made to reveal themselves by how they write back and forth to each other. A real treat!
B001G55JEK|5.0|Nosferatu is defiantly a masterpiece because it was the start of all vampire movies. The bad part about this movie is that it is really hard to find a good quality production of it. So far out of all the copy's that I have seen A2ZCDs has done the best job of remastering this title. If you have not yet seen this film and you are a big Vampire fan you are missing out on a piece of history.
0739368044|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books and was looking forward to finally getting the next installment. I have to say, I was really dissapointed. I listened to the audio version which is 23 cds. By the 5th or 6th disk, I was losing interest and considering putting it aside. The first 2/3 of the book was really sort of boring. I realize that in a time of war there would be multiple battles, but battle after battle in this book, there was never anything accomplished by them. It felt as if it was being written so that there would be lots of opportunities for special effects if it was made into a movie.     The fist book was so good that the movie really didn't do it justice. If this book was made into a movie they would probably have to add stuff instead of cutting stuff out.     Then the interview with Paolini and his editor at the end...I couldn't even listen to it. The editors voice is so annoying (high pitched and juvenile) that I couldn't even listen. She sounded like she was 12 and she had absolutely no interviewing skills at all. It just re-enforced the fact that the book was not very good instead of bolstering it with a great interview with Paolini.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|i'm going to cut to the chase here, this is NOTHING, i repeat, NOTHING like any of their older stuff. you just can't compare/contrast this album with any of their previous work, because it just doesn't work that way. does the unforgiven III sound comparable to the unforgiven I or II? no! after hearing this album for the first time, i was indifferent to it, so it took a couple of tries to get the jist of their style. since it's a new album, it has a different style. i love james' raw anger in \\"the judas kiss.\\" he just really goes to town on it. not to mention, the solos and riffs are just simply amazing. they are very complex and played in a very clean way. no mish-moshing of chords here, people. furthermore, i'd like to say i love every song off of this album. each song has it's own individuality and does not sound like the next, granted this album being a \\"thrash\\" perspective. usually all thrash sounds the same to me, but this does not.
0805047905|5.0|Never get tired of this one... love that sweet brown bear and all his friends
0439023483|5.0|Engaging story.  Fast start.  This book is a readers dream.  I was mesmerized by it the whole way through.  The characters are interesting.  The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it ended too soon.  This is a must read if you like a good story.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|escape is a great cd. it'S ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HEARD. THE WORDS AND MUSIC ARE WELL DONE. ANYONE INTERESTED IN THIS SINGER SHOULD BUY IT!!! MWJ
0765316889|4.0|In most series, whether they are many books long or if they are just a trilogy as this one is, the middle book is often considered the lull in the story.  This is the part when the author broadens the world in which he writes.  So, for the people that want a wham bam kind of plot line don't get the same kind of satisfaction.     In my opinion, Brandon Sanderson addresses this so called problem to keep those kind of readers interested.  He keeps growing his characters, but at the same time keeps the events rolling at a natural pace as to not bore the masses.  This is what makes this 3 book series a real good read for someone wanting to get in and out quick.    All in all, the first two books have been great, and I am anxiously awaiting the third at the end of this year.
B0000B1OGD|4.0|As this review begins, one must pose a question of sorts to the mass audiences.  If \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" were a travel destination, say like a classic visit to Dinosaur Land, would modern audience want to go, or would the glitz and glamour of the Jurassic attraction in the neighboring city drown the excitement.  Could a mom-and-pop destination, complete with an Allosaurus created by the maestro himself, Ray Harryhausen, still appeal to a generation transfixed on iPods, CGI, MySpace, and boy-band ring tones?  Is the destination worth the trip?  Below is compiled a review of sorts on why \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" would be an excellent place to spend your summer, complete with a restaurant guide, a locals favorite section, and the much needed, \\"Watch Your Step\\" section (aka the pitfalls to avoid).  This is a guide to hopefully help the amateur Harryhausen traveler, as well as the most experienced.  \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\" is a strange, yet wonderful trip that should be continually experienced (despite the bizarre ending), and hopefully never forgotten.<br /><br />For a trip to \\"The Valley of Gwangi\\", you want to pack light.  There will be quite a bit of running, horseback riding, church destruction, and trap making, so you definitely do not want to be weighted down with a burdening weight.  This guide suggests just finding what you need when you arrive, one could even approach the vast traveler himself, Tuck Kirby, straight from another death defying trip filled with cons, hassles, and barters.  He is your \\"need-to-get\\" guy.  On this trip, he is hunting for a horse, preferably one that his old flame, a lady named T.J., currently uses in one of the greatest sideshow attractions you are going to find on your trip.  With little to carry and a guide by your side, you may want to avoid such pitfalls as asking young children name Lope for help.  This is an obvious swindle, as he claims he needs to feed his family - while continually paying for further information.  Let's not even discuss the crazed gypsy with an eye-patch coupled with her small guide.  That is our competitor; you don't want to travel with them.  Trust me.  It is these socialites that you meet on this trip that will provide you with at least an hour and a half of entertainment. One can even be guaranteed the clich&eacute; shout \\"By George!\\" from our resident archeologist which is a constant source of laughter and amusement.  They may seem overplayed, wooden, and at times not quite as frightened as they should be that they are standing in front of a Triceratops, but they are good companions, and worthy of the special effects that will soon engulf you.<br /><br />Did I say \\"engulf\\", oops, I mean to say devour you!  Is anyone else hungry?  Looking for that perfect spot in the Valley where you can enjoy a sit down meal.  Well, count that out.  Here, it is survival of the fittest - literally.  When this guide went to tour the local eateries, we used the Gwangi as our guide.  He showed us how to properly eat Triceratops, elephants, jealous boyfriends, and anything else that was in the way.  To be honest, our Gwangi is an eating machine, but thanks to the brilliant animation by Harryhousen, it is worth the poor service.  Harryhousen may fall short on the small detail (some quote the lack of shadows), but it is the overall effect that makes you want to visit again and again.  The creatures he creates, while they are as colorful as a bowl of Lucky Charms, are realistic, coupled with honest reactions that put you there with the creatures.  The scene that stands out is one where our guides are trying to tie the neck of a Gwangi to keep him secure.  The beast screams, tugs, grabs at the real ropes in a way that real animation may have cheapened out.  Take these scenes of realism, our pesky - non-traumatized guides, and the detail of blood on the Gwangi's victims, and this film steps up another notch that a regular viewer may never see coming.  The detail during our fights, one couldcredit Harryhausen again, are superb.  While the colors seem to be a bit over the top, the attacks placed are not without scars.  This could make the average tourist see the danger and the madness in our team's unheroic ways to become the best sideshow in the Valley, and the true threat that lies within them.<br /><br />Finally, the \\"Watch Your Step\\" section.  With very little to fill this section, it is necessary because not everyone traveling will want to see the Gwangi due to what modern technologies are currently available.  All this guide can say is beware of these short pitfalls.  1) The ending.  Without ruining your entire trip, I must say that the last twenty minutes revealed a much different tone that the first 90 minutes of this journey.  With our iconic final scene, I felt our mayor of this town, Jim O' Connolly, captured the ideas of cowboys and dinosaurs fighting together, in fact it was the fight sequences that kept me glued to the screen, but there were two separate films in this one little B-movie.  There was the greed, the corruption, and the voice of our carnival people as they hunted for the main attraction, but then there was the counter-point to their greed.  There was the destruction - and that carried with it a new world that didn't mesh as well with the first.  Another \\"pitfall\\" to this trip, may be our locals (as they are also a plus), but their lack of concern when fatal errors occur to one of their own, their lack of true fear, and the clich&eacute; stereotypes that follow our bumbling archeologist are fun, but not for honest cinema.  Outside of these two minor drawbacks, the Gwangi will satisfy every urge you have to ensure safe passage through the Cape of Monster Cinema.<br /><br />Overall, I must admit, this film surprised me more than anticipated.  Having grown up with the Jurassic option always in plain sight, it was a pleasure to finally allow this film to breathe.  One can only hope others decide to pick up this journey and enjoy the sights, sounds, destroyed religious centers, and Allosaurus vs. Elephant fights.  A bit of warning if there needs to be, this is B-rated, this is not high quality cinema if you nitpick acting and technical civility, but when traveling in the rural south -- who needs that sort of high-tech honesty?  Ray Harryhausen influenced our current generation of film with such films as \\"Valley of Gwangi\\", and it shouldn't be forgotten.  I applaud this film for what it accomplished, and promise - even with the nimble ending - that if you choose to embark on an adventure like this - remember my first word of advise - pack light ... you are in for a strange and fantastic voyage!<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****en again, are superb.

8489367116|3.0|I was ambivalent about rating this book, because I actually enjoyed it very much. On the storytelling alone I would give it 4 stars. Gregory David Roberts' autobiographical novel kept me up late many nights - he certainly has led an unconventional and exciting life on the run in India. My favorite parts of the book were the relationships he had with the slum dwellers, Prabaker in particular. He captured the cadences of their speech perfectly, with humor and deep compassion. On this alone I would give the book 5 stars. However, I had a problem with Karla. I grew tired of the myriad descriptions of her green eyes - the prose was flowery and hard to swallow. And the descriptions of their lovemaking would have been funny were he not so earnest in his quest to be poetic. Just a few too many metaphors and adjectives for me. Karla herself evoked very little sympathy from me, even when the Great Mysterious Secret about her was revealed. To me she was selfish and shallow and not worth the adoration of Lin, the main character. I did not find her so-called clever turns of phrase to be so wise; rather I found them to be the cynical observations of a ruined and bitter woman. There were no ugly women in this book, or even plain women. I guess it is a credit to the author/main character that he finds drop-dead beauty in every woman he meets!<br />Having gotten that out of the way, let me say the author has done a remarkable job of bringing Bombay to the lay person. He tells of a lush, vibrant city that teems with fascinating characters (Karla aside) and the lessons it has taught him. I am planning a trip there soon; the book has enriched my enduring fascination with India. It is also a story of redemption, and you will have to read it yourself to discover what I mean. There is so much more I could say but I don't want to bore anyone. This is not high literature. But who cares? It is a grand read if you can get past the deep green, dusk-lit lagoons in the swirling maelstrom of Karla's bodacious haunted eyes...bodacious haunted eyes...
B000W91RUG|5.0|When I saw the previews for this show I was not impressed, looked like it could be silly and just another short lived fill in comedy.    I caught the first episode and thought it was good with potential and it has not let me down.  It could have easily fallen into the same old jokes about the scientists/nerds but is alot more than that.  Leonard, who is probably the most \\"normal\\" is wonderful in his expressions and being somewhere between the geek and normal.    If you have not seen this show due to its title or premise, do yourself a favor a catch an episode or two.
0156034026|5.0|This is the ultimate \\"the philosophy of East versus West\\" novel and although I was disturbed and, at times, resentful of the portrait of America and Americans as portrayed by the narrator of this tale, I was also enthralled and unable to stop reading.<br /><br />The story is related in the form of a monologue between the chronicler, Changez, and an anonymous American stranger who he meets quite by chance in a caf&eacute; in Pakistan.  His tale commences as he leaves his homeland to pursue an education at Princeton (an opportunity few Americans can afford) and after graduation is hired by a prestigious New York company at a very generous starting salary.  He is at first enamored with the American lifestyle, but after 9/11 discovers a feeling of kinship with the perpetrators while becoming more and more critical of his host country.<br /><br />Author Hamid uses his creation, Changez, to do a bit of finger wagging by having Changez espouses the belief that the U.S. \\"interferes in the affairs of other countries\\" while on the other he laments the U.S. r&eacute;sistance to \\"interfere\\" in the growing tensions between Pakistan and India. (reminiscent of a  teenager who comes to you for financial help but is annoyed when you attempt to provide some guidance to prevent a repeat of their financial woes and who, after accepting your cash, tells you to \\"stop interfering in their lives\\".)<br /><br />Changez observation that America is \\"giving itself over to dangerous nostalgia\\" is replayed for the reader in his allegorical retelling of his relationship with Erica, an AmERICAn woman who he loves but who is so resistant to letting go of her memories of her deceased lover that she is unable to accept Changez (changes???) and is ultimately destroyed because of her obsessive love of the past.<br /><br /> I will admit that Hamid is an extraordinary writer whose ability to draw you into the story and hold your attention is undeniable.  The subject matter being served in The Reluctant Fundamentalist, however, may not be a dish easily digested nor may it be suitable for every readers' palate. Taste and see for yourself.easily digested nor may it be suitable for every readers' palate. Taste and see for yourself.
0807126063|5.0|I highly recommend this book for those who like offbeat, literary books with an absurdist humor. For example, if you like The World According to Garp, you may like A Conspiracy of Dunces. It is one of the funniest books I've ever read, but the humor is unique and may not appeal to everyone.    I giggled the entire way through. The main character, Ignatius Riley, is one-of-a-kind and unforgettable. He feels like the anti-hero, in the sense that he encapsulates so much \\"negative\\" traits--he's a mama's boy, lazy, snobby intellectual, fat, a slob. But Toole's writing is brilliant and depicts him in a way where you root for him, sympathize with him, and want to go along with him on his adventures. The other characters are equally memorable, his mom, the bumbling police officer she dates, the bar owner. I also appreciate the diversity of characters in race and sexual orientation. It makes the whole book, which is set in 1960s New Orleans feel more authentic.     This is a book for those who've ever felt left out in life (and who hasn't?). It's also for those who can't relate to the values espoused by keeping up with the jones--dressing in the right clothes, having the right job, hitting the adult milestones at the right time.
031606792X|5.0|( Possible Spoiler )       Honestly,   I sense a lot of perhaps jealousy from some of reviewers... People are knit picking Bella, becuase she is young and gets it all.  Well while that is a fairytale ending, so is the whole series... As is with similar series I.E. Harry Potter , etc ,etc, etc.  I think the author did a wonderful job... Superb really.  Maybe I relate because at my young age of 27... I already have it all as well... A family, my dream guy, my kids, our house , etc.... I really relate to Bella, minus the whole being in love with a vamp thing LOL. ...  The whole series made me fall inlove with reading all over again, as if I had just picked up Emma for the first time... Never has any author really grabed me so much besides those great classic lit masters.  I give the book, and A+++++++ and the series is just is off the charts, WONDERFUL!!!
B0013ND30W|5.0|Disney's first classic to hit Blu-Ray is spectacular!  I have to admit that Sleeping Beauty isn't one of my favorite Disney movies, but I pretty much like them all is some way or another.  Why then the five stars?  The conversion to Blu-Ray is spot on!!!  I can't wait for them to convert the rest of the library, this is the way these movies are meant to be seen.  Not to mention I have barely tapped into BDlive yet (so far seems very cool).
0340933674|5.0|the world of paper artist rob ryan is a magical one, a place in which i wish i could aimlessly wander.  lovely, intricate work adorns each page.  i first discovered rob's work on the cover of The World to Come by dara horn, two years ago, and have since then stumbled across his etsy site as well.  be kind to yourself and purchase this book - no, two copies. one for you, one for someone you really really love.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I just have to say that yes...it clips, the audio mastering was not up to snuff, but who gives a s%$T!!...the POWER of the songs and the record overall you can say METALLICA is Back! this record rocks throughout and I'm playing air guitar now!!!! if you love hard rock and metal to get your rocks off, then get this record!!! it feels a nice fit from AJFA to Black and beyond. METALLICA make it sound easy and FUN! just Rock out and enjoy the melodies!!!!
B000I5X81K|5.0|After two best-selling albums, one begins to wonder if Josh Groban is becoming stagnant. Upon listening to record number three, \\"Awake\\", the answer is a resounding 'No!' The young singer with the voice who has captured the world still has it, and the album is proof that he is determined to continue on a journey of personal and professional growth.    Unlike Josh's first two albums, \\"Awake\\" is a mixture of different music styles. Yes, his more \\"classic\\" fare is still here, as evidenced by songs like 'Mai' and 'Un Dia Llegara'. However, even when singing in a foreign language, his songs are beginning to take on a more radio-friendly vibe. 'L'Ultima Notte' features a drum kit, and 'Solo por Ti' is led by an acoustic guitar.     In addition to more pop-like songs, the album stands out because of the number of English-language tracks on it. Four of these were co-written by Groban himself, and they add to the multi-dimensional aspect of the album. 'You are Loved (Don't Give Up)' is similar to some of his Italian-language pieces in its soarching orchestral arrangement, while 'February Song' and 'In Her Eyes' are more radio-friendly.     However, the most outstanding track (for me, at least) is 'Un Giorno per Noi (Romeo e Giulietta)'. On this track, Josh records the heart-breaking 'A Time for Us' from the film \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", albeit in Italian. The violin and Groban's soaring vocals make the tune resonate the themes of Shakespeare's most famous tragedy.    \\"Awake\\" is truly a masterpiece album, a definite continuation in the personal and professional journey Josh Groban has emerged on since releasing his self-titled album seven years ago. He has matured, finding his own sound in many languages, collaborating with a variety of different artists and, as always, allowing that voice to captivate.
0307386171|5.0|This book, which centers on a disastrous wedding night of two endearing characters, is a splendid read, which, unfortunately (and typically), a lot of American critics have misinterpreted.     It is NOT an attack on the sexual repression of the world before 1965. It is rather a reflection on what followed. Like all couples, Edward and Florence have to adjust to adulthood, to sharing, to a new life together. In the bad old days, they would have adjusted, society's norms forcing them to surrender a portion of themselves to accept the other, just as their parents have done (Edward's mother is \\"brain damaged\\" and Florences parents live in different professional worlds).    Mr. McEwan paints a convincing portrait of two young people, self involved as all young people are, but capable of reaching adulthood and a happy life together. In the dramatic confrontation of Chesil Beach, the siren call of the Cult of the Self, and its attendant sense that one is free to do anything one wishes, converts what could have been a minor tiff into an event which dissolves the marriage and ruins both of their lives.    In a coda at the end of the book, it is clear that neither Edward nor Florence have ever grown up and that they are both doomed to live unsatisfactory lives, Edward as somewhat feckless and irresponsible and Florence as professionally successful but alone and brittle. The dawning of the Age of Aquarius has left both of these charming young people in a purgatory of frozen adolescence.    The world today is filled with Edwards and Florences, attractive and accomplished people gradually losing their ability to mature, to grow, to love. And that is what makes this lovely and tragic book so powerful.
B000002GB4|5.0|this is one of there better albums. great band from the seventies.youll enjoy this album allot.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|Maybe I could have understood the movie better if I wasn't having so much fun watching it!  Why are Sam and Dale stuck out in the universe instead of going back to earth?  Well, I'd stay out in space if the alternative was the dreary, dust-ridden planet we get a glimpse of at the beginning of the film.  The movie picks up steam and color as soon as Dr. Zharkov kidnaps our hero and heroine and whisks them off to save the planet, and especially when they reach the court of the fabulous Ming the Merciless.  Ridiculed for its \\"camp\\" qualities when it came out, and for the inadequate and dubbed acting of Sam J. Jones as \\"Flash,\\" FLASH GORDON in fact tells its story in a relatively straightforward manner, while Jones is unexpectedly winning in a difficult role; as soon as he remembers his football plays in a push against Ming's henchmen in reel two, he won my heart in that old fashioned Lil Abner Peter Palmer way.  In some ways he's a fool, but no more than Jimmy Stewart was in the 30s and 40s movies FLASH harks back to.  In the words of Queen's catchy theme song, \\"Flash!  --Ahhh, ahhhh!\\"<br /><br />Melody Anderson does what she can with a all-American girl shtick, but she comes closer to pure camp with her endless posturing about America and her defiance of danger.  However, the role calls for her to show more complex emotions when she must give up Flash in order to save him, and she fulfills these scenes admirably, telling Aura, for example, that she can't poison Ming, for she has promised to be a good wife to him (in exchange for him sparing Flash's life).  Keeping her promise turns out to be her Achilles' heel, and that one trait seemed quintessentially American, a naive belief in one's word for good or bad.  She's like Sarah Palin, except her gowns are better.<br /><br />As Ming, Max von Sydow does better work than in any of those Ingmar Bergman movies that made him famous.  Tim Dalton takes his time in his slow evolution from evil to sidekick, and his portrayal gains strength from his early refusal to play for viewer sympathy.  Like everyone else, I enjoyed Brian Blessed's hawkman, though at times he comes perilously close to enjoying himself more than anyone else.  But hands down the movie belongs to Ornella Muti as Aura, she is smoking hot and just gets better and richer throughout the film until she attains actual cinema perfection in the last sequence of FLASH GORDON.  You'd have to be Myron Breckinridge to adequately describe her genius in print.s strength from his early refusal to play for viewer sympathy.

B000EHSVS2|1.0|I got two patton DVD a while back, it's the same picture as on this DVD. I gave one to a buddy, and both DVD's were bad about half way into the movie. I want to buy another one, but dont want to get my hopes up and be let down again. IM in Iraq and it takes a week or so to get a DVD. Patton was a true hero !!! Chestie Puller was also a true hero !!! I wish I could find a movie about him.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|My girls and I are making our way through the Gilmore Girls shows. We really loved this DVD. It's definitely a chick flick as the guys say and we enjoyed it very much.
B000GB775E|1.0|The story idea isn't totally lame but the dialogue and acting make this too torturous to watch.  Lindsay Lohan actually looked like she was reading from cue cards at one point in the film, and the delivery was like she was reading it for the first time..... horrible, horrible scene.  In fact that scene was so bad I rewound it 3 times just because I couldn't believe what I was seeing!  Don't waste your time on this movie.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Great movie! I highly recommend renting it if you enjoy classics or if you are simply looking for a highly entertaining movie to watch.  If you enjoyed the current release, you'll love the original version of \\"The Women\\" even better.

B0019X3ZZY|5.0|May I start my review by saying Salo is BANNED in Australia, and has been for over 30 years now. Now as an adult to be denied a film is rubbish and frustrates me (which I find ironic as facists are about censoring, the films main message of fascism). I managed to sneak my copy in the country past customs via amazon post and into my home theatre, where i watched it all night long. Now make note i saw this film years ago on the internet in poor quality (it was the only way, i wasn't paying $800 for a dvd) despite the poor quality the film had an impact upon me as i saw it as one of the most important films as the 20th century, with its message on facists. Now I finally got my hands on the criterion edition which contains a breath taking transfer, i couldnt believe it was the same film i was watching years ago. The second disc contains a number of interesting documentaries, including one that contains a number of  photos delted from the final cut.   However theres one issue...25 seconds is missing which is intacted in the bfi blu ray version. I really dont care seeing how its only a lousy poem, what about other lost footage (girl tied to electric chair) then i would stress a bit. Great job amazon fast shipping, I can finally show my country CENSORSHIP CAN NOT STOP ME.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is easily the best show on TV. It always re-invents itself. The problems usually with TV series is they rely on the same stuff that makes them popular. Lost is always changing. The production, acting & music is incredible. Sure it follows answers with more questions, but what would happen if it answered all the questions? It would stop being interesting and you would stop watching. It totally quenches my thirst but I keep wanting more. Every episode is like a top notch Movie.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|This product is awesome because the movie is awesome. One of the best of the last 10 years. The Amazon service is also very good. Thanx!
0143038583|5.0|This is educational/advocating writing at its finest. It is written in an engaging style that makes it easy to read. Yet, at the same time, it manages to fill the pages with facts that are, in themselves, challenging. The book has changed the way I think about food, largely just by making me think about food. This is something we do rarely, but it is becoming more and more necessary as food has become a concoction of chemicals and corn and has drifted away from being truly based on plants and whole grains. Just the mere information about how the food gets from the factory to you will make you want to reevaluate the way you eat and think about food.<br /><br />I have recently turned to a diet based on plants, fruits, and whole grains. As someone who loves good cooking and gourmet restaurants, I was a little worried at first. But, the truth is that this kind of cooking can yield some fantastic flavors and awaken taste buds that seem to have been dormant for too long. Though this decision was not a direct result of this book alone, this book helped me figure out the best ways to go about a fundamental change in diet. For further reading on diet and its relationship to health, I also recommend \\"The China Study.\\"
0375826726|1.0|Okay, so I am not necessarily someone who has the credentials to review books, but as I really enjoy fantasy books, I think I need to voice my opinion on this one:  What a waste of time!  I loved the first two books, and even read them twice (which I have never done before; once I read a book, I usually don't pick it up again).  Brisingr is without a doubt a \\"filler\\" book with no other objective than to increase Paolini's income.  75% of the book is totally unnecessary.  I think I probably skim-read half of the book, looking for anything that would advance the plot.  Interesting parts are definitely few and far between, and I even think the quality of writing is a digression from Eldest.  Don't even read this book: just wait for three or four years for the last book to come out, and then read the summary Paolini is sure to include in the beginning of the last book that will tell you all you needed to know about Brisingr in a couple of pages.
B00140PK6O|5.0|If you like Jane Austin movies, BBC period movies...then you will love this movie.  There are many story lines going on at the same time in the town of Cranford. There are many characters that you grow to love, and some that you love instantly. It is a 5 part series, that you wish would not end. It is clean, which I appreciate.      Spoiler alert: One of the story lines is a new Doctor coming to town to help the already established town Doctor. He is new, has new medical techniques and ideas. So there are many medical scenes. Where the movie is clean I would not recommend it for children under 10.  There is a broken arm where you see the bone protruding, an amputation where you don't actually see it but you see the big saw and you hear it.  There are many sad deaths in the movie...sad because you have come to love them and want their story line to keep going.      There are many funny parts that had me rolling and I have to say some I did not catch until the second time I watched it. There are many happy parts to the movie and it does have a great happy ending!!  It makes you yearn for a small town setting, and for life long friendships that are there through good times and bad times.    I loved this movie and hope they keep making more like it!!
0061122416|5.0|The depth and connectedness of this story is astounding. Coelho writes this in such a manner that you feel connected to main character to the point of feeling the emotions that he is feeling. This is the only book so far that i plan to read twice in a row.
B001C08RHA|4.0|Though I'm sure I would have NEVER picked Robert Downey Jr. for the lead, this movie worked! It's so economically directed, (it's directed by Foggy Nelson himself, Jon Favreau, from the highly underrated \\"Daredevil\\",) and so cleverly written, you forgive any sins the movie might committ along the way, (like how did Stark manage to make that rather lethal suit of INITIAL armor, [that in the comic book series he kept for about 40 issues,] from scraps found in the woebegone Afghani desert!?! Or how can he fly around the world on the tiny cannister of fuel he carries on himself while clad as Iron Man?)<br /><br />Anyway, what you enjoy most about this movie is the clever dialogue as delivered by Downey, the wizard action sequences as the sleeker, upgraded Iron Man goes about his business, and the finally, DECENTLY done CGI special effects, (in films about Marvel heroes, the CGI is too often WOEFULLY, obviously not real, ruining the illusion and hence the full enjoyment of some of the films. Both \\"Hulk\\" movies and the first two \\"Spiderman\\" flicks being cases in point.)<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, who has a knack for being in really good sci-fi action movies that are a cut above the pack, (\\"Sky Captain\\",) plays Tony Stark's/Iron Man's assistant and possible love interest Pepper Potts, (can you believe that name?!) Favreau gives himself a small part as Tony's chauffeur and Jeff Bridges, (who, I must say, has aged a bit since \\"The Big Lebowski\\"...he actually seems upper-middle-aged here!) plays an old friend of Tony's dad with an impossible biblical sounding name, Obidiah Stain, that surprises us all by the end of the film.<br /><br />I have yet to see a bad review of this movie, and it IS enjoyable, but is it because of Downey, Bridges, Paltrow, ILM or what...? It really doesn't do anything wrong, and really, isn't that what we most want from a movie...?
B00027JYLC|4.0|Growing up, I never thought I was very attractive.  I spent too much time complaining about my physical imperfections.  I wish someone had shown me the classic horror film, \\"Freaks.\\"  Seeing the unfortunate humans, known as \\"circus freaks,\\" who suffered from birth defects made me appreciate that I had arms and legs.  My heart broke for them.  It is sad to think that people would abuse and exploit other humans simply because they are handicapped.<br /><br />  Todd Browning, who directed 1931`s \\"Dracula,\\" also directed this horror masterpiece which used real life \\"circus freaks\\" as actors.  Hans, a German midget, falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, Cleopatra.  Cleopatra pretends to love Hans while she and her secret lover, strongman Hercules, plan to kill him for his riches.  When they are caught in the act, the \\"circus freaks\\" exact a horrifying revenge.<br /><br />  \\"Freaks\\" made me feel more sympathetic towards those with handicaps.  They have feelings just like everyone else.  Hans insisted that he was a man despite his diminutive size.  Perhaps Todd Browning was trying to tell us that if you hurt one of these special people, then fate will take revenge upon you.  I never make fun of people who are overweight for fear that I might become overweight.  A horrible accident can easily take away the use of a limb or cause brain damage.  It's very easy to become a \\"freak.\\"<br /><br />  The ending of \\"Freaks\\" is very creepy and unsettling.  You won't soon forget it.  Do I feel sorry for Cleopatra?  Most certainly not.  This film clearly sends out the message:  Don't harm the freaks or you will be harmed.<br /><br />  \\"Freaks\\" is highly recommended for those who enjoy good horror classics.  It is also recommended for those who seek out docudramas on the plights of those who are ostracized by society because of their appearance; such films include \\"The Elephant Man\\" and \\"Mask.\\"

I quickly became a Showtime subscriber and ordered the entire first season from Amazon. I was enchanted by the TV series and remain so to this day. For once I can say that, for the most part, I like the TV series better than the books;so do other Dexter-lovers that I know. I like second-season Dexter because he has begun to grow as a real person, because he is not infallible and because his sister has grown as a person and has to rescue him. The TV series has created a great set of supporting roles, such as LaGuerta, Harry, Matsuko,Debra,Doakes, Rita, Aster, Cody, etc. to name just a few, I have started the 3rd season and it is looking good. Go DEXTER!!!
0525457585|5.0|Once again, I remember reading this book when I was a child. I had always been a bookworm and no problems diving into the imaginary world. This book will bring you even further. The story is one that everyone can relate to - young and old. The translation from German seems to me very good. I unfortunately do not remember every exact wording in German. The message of the book is very clear once you start reading - and even though I was hesitant, I think the movie was very well done to capture this.<br />There are not many books that one can read every now and then and still feel a renewed bond with the story. This one will keep you wondering what happened to you when you grew up.
B000002GVO|5.0|I'm not going to compare Hotel California to any other album.  This is simply their greatest album.  Nearly flawless but, like the subject, not quite perfect.    I love the concept of California being heaven and hell.  I bought this album in December 1976, and then left for California right after Christmas.  That trip was planned, by the way, not a result of listening to the album.  I believed in the concept of California as heaven on earth.  Everything about SoCal was so great in 1977.  It was the place to be.  But of couse it really wasn't.  I saw it in awe, with eyes wide open, and missed or overlooked some things.  And that's the concept of this album, almost a warning that things aren't all they're cracked up to be.    I can easily see the direct connection to the \\"California Concept\\" in most of these songs.  Wasted Time, Victim of Love and Try and Love Again, maybe not so direct.  There was so much radio airplay on the first three songs of side one but they really delivered the message.  Maybe the more casual fans didn't realize what else they were missing.  At that time there were plenty of radio stations that played deep album tracks and even the entire album.  So there was ample opportunity to hear the other songs, and I think some people missed out on great music by not hearing the rest of the album.    To this day I think that The Last Resort is the best song the Eagles ever released.  Glenn Frey supposedly said that this song is Don Henley's best work.  I think this song speaks volumes about the virtues and promises of California, and how it was ruined by greed.  I mean, to be in Southern California at that time was fantastic beyond words.  It was where I wanted to be.  It was, to me, paradise.  A few years ago, a friend of mine said, \\"LA isn't what it used to be.  Know what I mean?\\", and I did.  I did know what he meant.  It's sad, because I guess I just have this fond remembrance of what things were like in LA when Hotel California was a new release.I've always liked Victim of Love better than Life In The Fast Lane.  It's recorded live in the studio.  On the record, there's even an inscription in the vinyl around the label that reads, \\"V.O.L. is five piece live\\".  It's refreshing to hear something so raw when everything else on the album is so polished.  But polished is good, too.  Wasted Time is so soulful and heartbreaking, and may be my second favorite song of the album.  It's lush and polished and it works.  Even the brief Wasted Time Reprise (which seemed way out of place the first time I listened) works on this album.    New Kid In Town is also great because it's all about \\"What have you done for me lately?\\", which was so LA at the time and even more so now.  It's delivered so smoothly that it shows how subtle the change is from being on top of the world one day to being a nobody the next.  Of the singles released from the album New Kid In Town has to be the most pop-oriented song.  It's really more like their previous singles than Hotel California and Life In The Fast Lane.  To this day I like New Kid In Town better than those other 2 songs.    Another reviewer said this was a rather dark themed album for the late 70's.  That's probably true because the late 70's were all about doing anything you could get away with just to have the right amount of fun.  Hotel California as a whole was saying that a good time wouldn't last forever, we're gonna run out of land and resources and it will be too expensive to enjoy.  Maybe it was too dark, but that lifestyle got out of control and further ruined Paradise On Earth.    I still love visiting, especially Southern California.  This will sound goofy, but it truly does give me energy that I don't get anywhere else.  But, for me, it really isn't the same as it was.  That's what Hotel California was saying way back when.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|I had heard so much about this album before my boyfriend gave it to me to put on my ipod and listen to as he had gotten us tickets to go and see the live version, and this always puts me off - hence I wasn't expecting to love it but basically the reviews which are raving it are all 100% true.   It really is so painful and beautiful and so incredibly personal that it leaves me wondering  how Vernon can sing the songs live without weeping. At the gig, he got everyone to sing \\"what might have been lost\\" over and over as a 'backing track', which he conducted to reach an amazing crescendo - I was moved to tears. Even more beautiful live, I didn't want to leave and now when I listen to the album on headphones I am transported back to that evening.   Thank you is all I want to say to Justin Vernon, thank you so much for sharing this music
0452289963|5.0|It's a much better earth than the one this evil, lying misleader has to offer.  He paints a pretty picture...that completely removed God from your life...Don't you know??? you take the place of GOD now according to this man.  I don't know about you, but I in no way feel I could ever take the place of God, nor would I try to strip myself of the many blessings God has for my life by sayin I am GOD.  That is what these people are doing to you in this book.  It will lead you down a lonely sad road that eventually leads straight to HELL!!  Don't buy it!
B001HAMC1M|2.0|I certainly agree that the show needed to change but wasn't this ep ripped out of an old Danielle Steel novel?

0307388840|2.0|I decided to read this book because of the enthusiasm and hype that has surrounded it.  I took it with me to read while on a plane trip. The only reason I was able to get through the first 100 pages was because I had no appealing alternatives as I was trapped next to the window for my several hour airplane ride.<br /><br />As others have said, the book is overwritten.  While there is a lot of descriptive language, it is overdone and often irrelevant.  At times it felt like the author wanted the reader to know how many words he knew or could use to describe something that was quite simplistic.  The characters, except for Briony, are mostly absent, and Briony is just plain unlikeable.  I had read that Ian McEwan did an outstanding job of infiltrating the psychology of the characters--I wholeheartedly disagree.  The characters were barely present, therefore hard to care about or empathize with.<br /><br />The \\"mystery\\" of the book was easy enough to figure out. After finally making in through the first part, I was intrigued and wanted to keep reading.  While I thought the \\"mystery\\" wasn't really a mystery at all and an obvious conclusion, I was hoping for some great twist or turning point -- hoping that I hadn't figured out what really happened on the night around which the story was built.  Unfortunately, there was no such twist, just disappointment that the truth was so obvious.<br /><br />Then, in hoping that Briony might recant, I continued to keep reading.  Again, disappointed with the anticipation of something that never came to fruition.<br /><br />The parts of the book are abrupt transitions from one another.  Each part requires the same determination as the first one to keep going even when it seems like the story isn't.  When I finally was able to get interested in the new section, the book abruptly transitioned to the next section.<br /><br />I read the book before reading any reviews, and was somewhat relieved to see that I wasn't the only person who was so sorely disappointed with the book.  With all of the hype surrounding the book, I surely thought there must be something that I was missing.<br /><br />I always try to take something away from the experience of reading a book, and there were a few instances throughout that caused me to stop and really think.  One was when Briony was relating to her cousin and realizing how others and our reaction to others often help us to learn about ourselves.  It is through how we relate and respond that we can learn something about ourselves that we didn't previous know, or hadn't thought about.<br /><br />Another example was the depiction of the experience of Briony telling her story and then feeling trapped in her story with no space to modify it or turn back from it.  This made me think about how often this probably happens with situations of similar magnitude as well as seemingly insignificant situations.<br /><br />These are two examples of how I was able to use the book and relate it to life beyond the book.<br /><br />Overall, two stars.With all of the hype surrounding the book, I surely thought there must be something that I was missing.

B000051Y0G|5.0|As you may or may not recall, I did a review of Cyndi Lauper's effort titled \\"At Last\\". Well, to say the least, there were many unhappy campers out there. They accused your beloved Metamorpho of being cruel (who me?), heartless(!) and without remorse. Personally, I think they went a bit too far because I included my classic humour which took the edge of a bit. (Which is akin to someone telling you they'll throw acid on you but they'll water it down first!). In any event, you can imagine my surprise when I came home to find Cyndi sleeping on my front lawn.<br /><br />I made some tea and invited her in. \\"Oh Metamorpho\\", she pined, \\"how could you do such a thing to me\\"? I started to apologize when a tear formed on her lamb face and she went on, \\"don't do me like that, don't do me like that, you know I love you Metamorpho baby, don't do me like that\\".<br />I felt like a heel (instead of a beloved sole) and thus, assured her that I will pay full restitution. She beamed. Her eyes opened wide and sparkled. \\"Oh, thank you Metamorpho! You are the best! Now I can go out and have some fun\\". And, before I could blink, off she bopped.<br /><br />Well folks, here it is. A review which honors Cyndi. And, considering my very busy schedule at the moment, you know this is very special. \\"She's So Unusual\\" is a definitive classic of the early 80's. As you recall, the early 80's had a sprout of artists who took over the popular music scene. You had the Madonna thing going on, and lest we forget, the Springsteen and Michael Jackson offerings. But, as considerable as those artists are, Cyndi's debut album justifiably deserves to be in this elite group.<br /><br />With her outrageous New Yawk persona, her wild, offbeat colorful clothing, and her hair looking like it went through a Waring blender, you just knew she was a real live walking event in and unto herself. Talk about impact! \\"She's So Unusual\\" was mega. This was no small feat, believe me. A circus-like diva who had the goods to back up her obvious talent. Astounding.<br /><br />I cannot think of many albums that have the energy, the song smarts, and the rockin' and svelte aura of the first 6 songs here. It creates a estactic beginning with \\"Money Changes Everything\\". And, although that fact is a little on the shallow side, it's quite accurate and very true in reality. She moves on to a virtual anthem of young women everywhere with \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\". With the organ-synth swirling around, it spirals into a hearty insistence, with a girl group chorus chiming in, which is more than appropriate. Moving on with the smooth, synchopated beat of Prince's \\"When You Were Mine\\". Cyndi continues to keep the pressure on with pleasurable pop. I cannot get over the subject matter and the sexual ambiguity on this song. But don't forget, we are talking about a Prince song here. Regardless, Cyndi hits a note here that sounds like a spaceship landing on earth. Really, nothing like it that I've ever heard.<br /><br />\\"Time After Time\\" then fits in perfectly. Moist, delicate are words to describe this song. I especially like the line \\"suitcase of memories\\". How true that we tend to bring our luggage along with this as we travel though life. \\"She Bop\\" then kicks. It is Cyndi as a panther, out on the prowl, looking for predatory fun. The backing synth and musical runs are so pleasing on this. Everybody bops on this tune (you, they, we, he, she) that, inevitably, you will too. The excellence continues with \\"All Through the Night\\", with, yet, another keyboard run with Cyndi providing excellent, vocal yearning and a soft plea towards the light. Marvelous.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are good and round out the album. But, as I said, not many channel the energy and just plain listenable pleasure as those first 6 songs. On this C.D. remaster, you get 3 live renditions that prove that Cyndi is no fluke. She's got the goods and, yes people, she is that good!<br /><br />In closing, let's not forget the musicianship here. An excellent band (I think The Hooters) who provide Cyndi the full freedom to fly with these tunes. Never out of place, nothing that's there that doesn't fit, it is a testimony to perfect production. Trust me on this.<br /><br />Anyway Cyndi, I hope you are happy with this review. Do you forgive me? I hope so. Hold on folks, the phone is ringing. \\"Hello? Oh yes Cyndi, I'm glad you liked it. What's that? Oh no problem my lamb. Bye now.\\" Folks, she just called to thank me for showing her true colours!<br /><br />Metamorpho Changes Everything ;)ovide Cyndi the full freedom to fly with these tunes.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|it was a video for Doctor Who that put me in touch with Muse.  I fell in love with Map Of The Problematic and immediately bought the CD.  The CD knocked my socks off and I became an instant fan.  It is easy to hear why this band has so influenced Stephenie Meyer's Twilight book series.  Thanks to my love of all things Doctor Who (and David Tennant) for exposing me to this great Brit band.  Check it out!
031606792X|5.0|I do believe Bella had every right to get all she got. All the love, all the family, all the money. Why? While some people believe that she didn't deserve it for breaking Jacob's heart, not going to college and marrying too young among other reasons, she did make the right choices. Lack of personality? How about standing your ground when everything else around you was falling apart, as in, vampires are coming to kill you, possibly your dad and half the town where you live. Or a younger guy has a crush on you, and you love the guy, but not the way he wants you to love him, she didn't give in just to make him happy.  [...]    And yes, she got an endless supply of money, because she chose carefully who to marry, not that that was important to her anyway. But if life presents you with a handsome, smart, strong, caring, protective, controlled, selfless person, who is also rich and in love with you, you would only be stupid if you didn't take it.  It's a novel, not to be taken as a guide for your life, unless there really are vampires out there, in which case, please tell me where they are.  And of course, while it was surprising, it was also to be expected that Jacob would imprint on Nessie. If he couldn't have Bella, then he got the next best thing, her beautiful baby. No worries about Pedophilia here, all Twilight Saga readers know that's not the issue. Only love that grew as the child grew. Nothing wrong with that.    It's a novel, take the good from it, the rest is fiction.
B000KC8O3S|5.0|the music from this series would continue to haunt me long after I watched the shows.  I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack.  Murray Gold is an amazing composer.  I swear, the music sounds as though it was written and performed for the movies.  The greatest thing about the latest series has been it's production values, writing, acting, underlined by the superb music.  All of this makes this show, indeed, one of the finest on either side of the pond.
1933492287|5.0|I first read this book in 'Top Gear' magazine, checked out the website, and then discovered that Amazon were selling the book cheaper! It's an incredible book! While there are many artists who create stunning visuals, Daniel Simon's are so incredibly lifelike I though initially he had got someone to actually build his vehicles! His love and dedication to his art are obvious from the design processes that are explained in the book. All my colleagues in my architectural firm are fighting for their turn to look through this book! Amazon, you've come through for me again. Thank you!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I loved the casting and  acting and music (written for the movie) of this British costume drama set in mid-19th cenury England.  I have already viewed it 5 or 6 times.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Okay, let me just say, that this is the best Marvel Adaptation I have seen since Spiderman 2, and to have it immediately followed by the new Hulk movie just about made this the best year for superhero movies.  And the very thought of those two characters, Iron Man and the Hulk, crossing over, is sooooooooo exciting I can barely contain myself.<br /><br />Now for the nitty-gritty:  Some people, including myself, have questioned the choice of Robert Downey Jr playing Stark.  When I saw, ages ago, that he would be the title character, I was kind of surprised.  Downey, it seems to me, has been flying low under the radar lately.  With Iron Man he explodes onto the scene, and, as far as I can see, blows the skeptics away.<br /><br />Gwyneth as Pepper Potts? A surprise, I never expect to see her in supporting roles, but in this one she looked good.  (and, as an aside, at a healthier weight than I think I have ever seen)<br /><br />Jeff Bridges:  Most Excellent, per usual, but if you have a pet peeve with word pronounciation you won't like his treatment of 'manufactured'.<br /><br />Like I said, definitely the best superhero movie from Marvel that I have seen in a long time.  And The Incredible Hulk is an impressive companion, so I hope when it comes out on DVD they sell them in sets!!<br /><br />I highly reccommend it, it's definitely worth the price of a movie ticket or rental fee and even purchasing the DVD.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|This album is epic and powerful, but at the same time hauntingly beautiful. Most songs begin with a peaceful prelude that elegantly fades into a wall of sound. Just when you think you might not be able to stand the force of it, you hear this mesmerizing voice that is both ethereal and intense. The more you listen, the more you begin to pick up the subtle fusion of music and voice. This is truly an epic and magnificent album.

0226264211|3.0|the title above says it all.     something missing in his considerations.     perhaps should include a chapter on human character and the greed that appears to run rampant in the higher levels of the economic ladder.
B000VWYNOG|4.0|I particularly enjoy 'greatest hits' of most artists because these albums tend to weed out the songs that didn't quite make it for them.  This one is typical of that genre so I feel that even though I wasn't a great fan of Van Morrison I appreciate his best efforts and end up feeling like I get my moneys worth.
0061478784|5.0|It was great timing the product arrived just after I had a job interview. I've been eagerly waiting for this to arrive and a few days after the estimated delivery date it did. At a perfect timing even.<br /><br />Howl's Moving Castle is one interesting book. Diana Wynne Jones puts it in a way where one has to keep reading in order to understand what the deal really is. As I read, my mind wanders off to what could happen next given all the details I've read so far and I couldn't be quite too sure at first, especially with Howl's unpredictable behavior. The story takes place in Sophie's perspective and as I was reading I seem to think and feel like her as well.<br /><br />I loved the part where everything slowly revealed (it was almost near the end of the book) itself until in the end the good always prevailed. I have to agree with one of the reviews that the ending seemed to be a bit hurried and I would've wanted a little more detail to it. But then again, it is normal for writers to want to hurry finish putting their ideas into writing that sometimes it affects the ending. It is understandable.<br /><br />As for the book copy, it may just be me but I think I found quite a few typographical errors but it doesn't much affect the standard of the book.<br /><br />As for the extras, I was expecting more than just the interview with Diana Wynne Jones. It's funny yet quite true what she said about girls falling in love with Howl. It just goes to show that this book is very inspirational. Thank you, Diana Wynne Jones for this amazing novel.
B00001IVOR|5.0|I think  Wu-Tang Forever is one of the greatest albums ever made.  Lyrically, it is the best.  Production wise, one of the best.  I can't understand the argument saying that the album is too long.  Besides \\"Maria\\" every song on the album is an absolute banger.  Perhaps they could've broken it into two albums for their own benefit, but I can't honestly say I've ever listened to one album for a longer period of time and enjoyed it.  Every track has something for someone, and if you like Wu, you're in heaven.  The album isn't like any other; most albums have a very succinct formula: Songs for the radio/women, songs about partying, and songs about being \\"hard.\\"  But Wu's contract allowed them more freedom from a production standpoint and the result is the most unique mainstream album in history.  WORTH EVERY PENNY.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I liked the theater version but when I saw the long one I realized the scope of the whole story, and so enjoyed the development of all the characters that I wanted to own it. It's a jewel of a movie, and  I loved to learn more about how it was imagined and made. Fantastic artistry and craftsmanship. A masterpiece.
0930289234|5.0|This book is a phenomenal read. I had a really hard time putting it down from the moment I got it and finished it in two days. I highly recommend this book, both for its graphic style and for its story. It's a little eerie how this cold war era book rings true today, many years later.<br />I think this book is a great read for both comic and graphic novel fans as well as the casual reader. If you're looking at getting a friend into graphic novels, this is the book to use to hook them in.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I think, and some people will disagree or even be mad at me for this, but Heath Ledger had, to me, re-created the image, visually as well as with sounds to match( am I the only one not completely struck by that voice), of what the Joker could be and I think that the future of this artform may yet not be totally lost in the realm of repeats, sequels, prequels or other ideas that may have had good intentions but lost their way from thought to theater. I praise Mr. Nolan, Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart(loved Thank You for Smoking), Michael Caine as ever a joy to watch, Morgan Freeman( Yes man Yes), Maggie \\"The Hottest Secretary Ever\\" Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman and never to be forgotten Heath Ledger for putting into form something like this that could be teach people that maybe they have the wrong ideas of what our world is and what it should be.
630521610X|4.0|This movie is great every millionth time you see it but there is nothing like the first time. The first time is great when you don't know who the killer is and you're guessing all the way through. It's extremely spooky the first time you watch it and thats the whole point. It's your typical teen slasher but it came at a time when a teen slasher wasn't typical. Of course now everybody tries to make stupid teen horror movies but nothing comes close to Scream! Scream 2 and 3 are also good but of course don't even come close to the original! Great Stars and great acting help this movie out too! Neve Campbell is perfect, Rose McGowan does great, David Arquette and Courteney Cox just have great chemistry! Skeet Ulrich is the new Johnny Depp for Wes Craven and Matthew Lliard and whoever plays Randy are just great. You couldn't have picked better people. Oh and Drew Barrymore looking great for her short stint in this movie! If you haven't seen it WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??? You have to check this out!
0375826726|2.0|Well, I haven't read it yet, but the quality of the paper used is lower than in eragon and eldest. It was something I would not had expected from a hardcover edition... I would have paid some extra bucks for a better quality.   Of course it doesn't change the fact that it might be a good novel.
B00104W8T6|4.0|This is a fun soundtrack that evokes the feeling of the movie...an interesting mix of music with a quirky twist and airy feel.  Many of the tunes have a folksy feel, but there's also a couple of good classics (the Kinks, Mott the Hoople, Buddy Holly) to balance it out.  I happen to adore the opening credits tune (Barry Polisar's All I Want Is You) as it brings back childhood memories of other hilarious Polisar tunes like \\"Don't Stick Your Finger Up Your Nose\\" and \\"Early Sunday Morning\\" :-)  If you enjoyed the movie, it's easy to enjoy the soundtrack even if many of the tunes aren't ones you might normally choose (at least that was the case with me).

I collect pop up books, and this one is top notch!  the binding and cover are sturdy and beautiful, and the pop ups inside are ornate.  My kids and I love it, and it's on the shelf with all of the best children's collectible books!
B001G8WDIW|5.0|Old English houses must be the most interesting in the world, full of nooks, mirrors, wardrobes, and mysterious doors. While exploring her new home, young Coraline discovers a door that goes nowhere, bricked up when the house was subdivided into flats. A bit bored this summer, one day out of curiosity she unlocks it, only to find that the bricks are gone and a dark passageway beckons. Naturally, she follows it to the other world, which resembles the one she just left. In this house are Coraline's other mother and other father, and for while, she is delighted. A sense of menace looms and grows, however, and soon Coraline realizes that she has walked into a deadly trap. Her own fate, as well as the fates of her real parents and some people she hasn't ever met, have become the objects of nefarious game that Coraline must win at all costs.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman is a gifted author following the traditions of the great English fantasy writers, adding his own creative genius to the genre. He is the only author I have encountered who can read his own work with the verve of a professional narrator. From the very first page, the reader is drawn into Coraline's world, and willingly follows her from the real to the imaginary. Gaiman is one of the few contemporary writers who does not have to resort to outlandish settings or contrived plot devices; the transition from one world to the next is seamless and credible. And nary a vampire to be seen.
0439806119|5.0|Wow.  I read this book and LOVED it. It starts out kind of slow, but gets a lot better. Once it does get better it's like high-speed drama without being tacky. I couldn't put it down. I mean how could anyone when Tally has a choice--betray your best friend, Shay and turn supermodel gorgeous, don't betray her and stay ugly for life--, Shay has a dream--to escape the pretty-making operation-- and the whole world has an awful secret. It deals with a dystopia that is so terrifying, mixed up with environmental messages and with startling specks of romance and friendship. Not to mention the detail (and the imagination) of the ugly/pretty/smoke world. David is so cool. I like sci-fi but this book made me like it 1,000 times more. I cannot wait to read [[ASIN:0689865392 Pretties (Uglies Trilogy, Book 2)]]!!!
B00192KCQ0|2.0|And the prodigal sons return with a decent enough album. The problem is, I can't help feeling that they're just trying too hard to placate the masses. Add to this an uber dry and blow out production by Rubin and it just become nothing special. Testament, Overkill and many other thrash bands have kept the fire burning and never went for commercial acceptance(failure). Metallica lost their way a long time ago and it's too late.<br /><br />Seriously, check out Testament's \\"Formation of Damnation\\" or Megadeth's \\"United Abominations\\" that hold some real gravity and excellent metal that's not forced.

B0009UVBQI|5.0|Stephen Chow outdid himself in \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", a movie he wrote, directed and stars in.  The humor is slapstick and off the wall, reminiscent of Road Runner vs. Wile E. Coyote in some scenes.      The plot is as follows:  Chow and his chubby sidekick want to become members of the Axe Gang.  The two commit a few petty crimes to prove they are worthy criminals.  When they enter the tacky slum run by a chainsmoking landlady and her womanizing landlord husband and try to intimidate the slum dwellers, the real hilarity begins.  The scenes with the knives and snakes are beyond funny!  (\\"Hey!  Who's throwing handles!\\" the landlady squawks.)  The leader of the Axe Gang sends Chow on an assignment to release the most fierce criminal of all time.  If Chow accomplishes this feat, he will be accepted into the gang.  In the final scene, the \\"world's greatest criminal\\" and Chow face off and Chow's chi is ultimately realized.      Along the way, the viewer is introduced to a cast of interesting characters including the \\"coolie,\\" the tailor, the noodles and congee maker, the buck-toothed siren, the gay hair-cutter, and the deaf/mute vending girl who has a special tie with Chow's character that he has forgotten, but she never has.      Kung Fu Hustle is an odd mixture of violence and comedy and it works.  There are so many comedic surprises in this movie it's easy to watch it numerous times.  I own it and it is one of my children and my all time favorites.
0375826726|2.0|After waiting so long for this book - what a disappointment! The first two books were full of innocence and honesty! Characteristics that can also be found in Eragon and the author himself. They came from the heart and you as a reader felt it. Brisinger lacks both of those qualities. It is much too long and spends too much time on frivilous things. If this had been the first book in the cycle. I would never have read the rest.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs. The backup group is wonderful and Melody's original compositions are the best.
B000W9DSVW|3.0|I enjoyed the movies my self and looked forward to the BD release, but when I put them in my player and noticed the almost DVD quality video I felt ripped off.  There are numerous artifacts through out the movies and bad colors.  Buy with caution.

B0019OP0GU|5.0|I really enjoyed Ballet Shoes.  I am a big fan of the original novel by Noel Streatfield and so I was nervous about seeing the film version, afraid that too much would be changed, but instead it is wonderfully true to the book and really makes the story come to life in a whole new way.  The characters were delightful, spot-on to the book, and the acting was well done.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good family-friendly flick with a feel-good story and strong, likable characters.
1593083343|1.0|This book is VERY poor condition.  The pages are uneven and look like they were cut when the blade needed changing or sharpening or cut with too many at once.      I am returning it to Amazon, the only good thing is that I bought it with Amazon, they are paying for return shipping.  I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS.  I am a frequent customer and will continue to be.
B000002MY3|5.0|Just a great CD. The first time I heard \\"You Oughta Know\\" I was like wow who is this angry chick. From the summer of '95 through the better part of '96 this CD pumped out hit after hit.  \\"Hand in My Pocket\\", \\"Ironic\\", \\"Head Over Feet\\", on and on.  Every song on here though is great not just the hits.  This is one of those CDs when I put it in I'm transported back to another time in my life.  That is what I use as criteria for a great album.  If it conjures up feelings and thoughts of when you first heard it.  \\"Hand in Pocket\\" was the one I really identified with back then.  Being in my early/mid '20s at the time and in the middle of mass confusion with what to do with my life and being in my first real adult relationship.  Alot of good stuff on here.  Unfortunately Alanis has not come close to this since but she'll always have this feather in her cap.
0930289528|5.0|This is a very interesting tale about police state and the consequences it has on its citizens. Drawings are cute while the story moves at an adequate pace. It is also remarkable the component of rebellion against oppression. I would recomend it for teenagers from 14 years old on. Please note Alan Moore is a comic writer with a sense for complex characters and let´s say some deeper issues.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|Quality of the product is fine, no issues with the packaging or actual DVD's. I know sometimes you can get faulty DVD's and it sucks when you try to have soemthing you want to \\"keep\\"<br /><br />The actual series is good because they don't chintz out on the effects. I like the multiple scenes with the endo-skeletons. With CGI nowdays it was a perfect time to tell this story. The entire cast is spot on and I am loving season 2 and will definitely buy that as well.

0452289963|3.0|I felt it was difficult to read.  Too many words to really understand the meaning.  But going to continue to work my way thru it.  I enjoy ordering from Amazon but recieved a shipment yesterday and was shocked at one of the books I ordered.  I had NO idea that a book I paid over $30+ for did not have any story line on Prince..........its mostly a coffee table book with pictures and not what I had expected at all.  Very disapointed.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|In \\"Batman Begins,\\" Christopher Nolan managed to do what few directors could do -- create a dark, gritty atmosphere around an all-too-human Batman, who fights for the oppressed with quiet intensity.<br /><br />That moody murk is only intensified in the breathtaking, harrowing \\"Dark Knight,\\" which fills itself with blasts of action, psychological twists and a shocking tragedy. Nolan pulls no punches for our dark knight or his ever-endangered Gotham City, but brilliant acting of the hero and villains is what truly elevates the second of Nolan's Batman movies to a work of cinematic art.<br /><br />Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing to fight the good fight for Gotham, even when he gets hurt in a fight against Scarecrow and some Batman impersonators.<br /><br />So unsurprisingly, he's is feeling fairly in his crimefighting abilities, especially since the new DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is a morally-upright good-guy. But Batman isn't prepared for the Joker (Heath Ledger) a mad clownish psychopath who has hired himself out to the mob to destroy their worst enemy, the Dark Knight. He starts blackmailing Batman by killing Gotham citizens, and saying he won't stop until Batman turns himself in.<br /><br />But even when captured, the Joker has an ace up his sleep -- Dent and Rachel Dawes' (Maggie Gyllenhaal) lives. And after a devastating loss, Batman finds himself dealing with the Joker taking all of Gotham hostage, and the maddened and disfigured Dent bringing vigilante justice to all those whom he thinks have wronged him. Only Batman has a chance of stopping even one of them -- let alone both -- but doing so may tarnish the Dark Knight forever.<br /><br />Most directors would have given this movie a distinctly comic-book, slick pop-culture feel. But no matter how hard you search, there's not a single hint in \\"The Dark Knight\\" that anything kitschy or campy came before it, or that it was originally a comic book. Instead Christopher Nolan creates a movie as dark, tightly-wound and intense as Batman himself.<br /><br />And Nolan's skills are even more polished this time around -- lots of kinetic action, vicious dogs and car chases, including the rather silly-looking Batpod and the tanklike Batmobile. The dialogue is drizzled with dry humor (\\"That isn't exactly what I had in mind when I said I wanted to inspire people\\",\\" Batman says, looking at a bunch of impersonators), mostly to temper the overhanging sense of horror and apprehension.<br /><br />This is especially true whenever the Joker's corrosive presence is onscreen, since he's all too happy to stick pointy objects in people -- he's creepier than a thousand boogeymen. And Nolan is not afraid to further darken the storyline by inflicting yet another personal tragedy on Batman. His direction is painfully delicate as he explores Wayne's sorrow and guilt.<br /><br />But the most striking aspect of \\"The Dark Knight\\" is Nolan's delvings into morality -- The Joker has none and Dent's becomes horribly perverted, but we're reminded that there are some who will not be corrupted even if they lose what is most precious. It's almost a doom'n'gloom movie, but the faint hints of optimism and hope keep it from being TOO overwhelmingly dark.<br /><br />Christian Bale is simply perfection as Bruce Wayne/Batman, using his handsomely chiseled face and piercing eyes to best advantage -- even in the most tragic scenes, where you can practically see Wayne's soul bleeding. And he has a difficult character to wrangle with -- not only does he have to expose Batman's pain and struggles, but also his inner incorruptibility.<br /><br />On the flipside, the late Heath Ledger is blindingly brilliant as the sadistic, creepy, gleefully malign Joker, and he chews the scenery as few actors could. He's pretty spine-chilling, actually -- the Joker is a true \\"agent of chaos,\\" whose intent is to seize Gotham, and corrupt Batman's soul along the way. There's also a solid (and underrated) supporting cast-- Eckhart is outstanding as an upstanding DA whose morality becomes horribly perverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.<br /><br />The two-disc special edition isn't quite as special as I had hoped (deleted scenes?), but it has a serviceable bunch of extras anyway, including a digital copy of the selfsame movie, galleries for pictures, IMAX renderings of certain scenes, a bunch of mocked-up news programs from \\"Gotham Tonight\\" and a documentary about the making of the film. I smell double-dipping in this movie's future, especially since the blu-ray is reportedly far better endowed with extras.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is suffused with darkness and some truly ghastly villains, but the magnificent acting and dryly witty script are what really make this a masterpiece. Utterly astounding -- and promises better yet to come.rverted (along with his handsome face), Gyllenhaal has a solid role that she plays well, and Michael Caine is a quiet, steady flame as the ever-faithful, dryly sardonic Alfred.

B0000004V2|5.0|If you're at all curious about the Stone Roses and their refreshing brand of britpop, I say go for it. Their 1989 debut is a really worthwhile record, though I must admit it took me longer than I thought to get into it. It really conjures up a certain time and a certain place, and yet its pretty timeless. Personally, it takes me both to the grey streets of cities like Manchester and to the wide English countryside (which I always imagine, listening to this, with stray hay floating through the air).    I've heard this band being called psychedelic. Though they add a couple of minor artsy touches reminiscent of psychedelia (backwards guitar in \\"Don't Stop\\", flanged guitar in \\"Bye Bye Badman\\", etc), I wouldn't really call them that. They're just catchy English rock songs, guitar, bass, drums, gentle but strong vocals from Ian Brown, and while some can be moody (like \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" and the short, blunt \\"Elizabeth My Dear\\"), most of them are delivered joyously, particularly some of the choruses. There's even a jam to finish things off at the end of \\"I Am the Resurrection\\")    I'd recommend this record to fans of Blur, The Smiths, Suede, Oasis and the like. It's quality. The Stone Roses are monolithic flowers indeed.

B0012GMX1K|4.0|The first song I ever heard from Gentle Giant was \\"Knots\\" from this album, which I think is their most well known disc. I was really inspired by its rhythmic, complex, teasing vocals and cheeky xylophone and violin. It's still my favorite track, though there's a fair few things to enjoy about this album, whether it's the hard rock of \\"Cry For Everyone\\", the sentimental, almost hymn-like \\"Think of Me With Kindness\\", or the grand rough and tumble of \\"Dog's Life\\" (whose strings remind me of something you'd hear on the Beatles \\"White Album\\", and whose vocals remind me in parts of how the Oompa-Loompas sing in the film \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\"). The opener \\"The Advent of Panurge\\" is a great way to start too, featuring some of that interwoven vocal style you hear on \\"Knots\\" but in a more toned down way.    Along with lyrics, the booklet comes with comments by the band about what inspired them to write each track, and what the tracks are about, which is helpful.    I'd recommend this for progressive rock collectors, definitely. It's light and fun.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|And I am telling you that this ain't going!   Never before has such a long and eagerly awaited debut, from a very gifted and promising vocalist, been such a disappointment. Not at all what you were led to expect from the tease of 'Spotlight', Jennifer Hudson is vocally lost in riffs gone past, sinking into the sound of banality that has become all to prevalent in contemporary neo soul music. The voice that we hoped would liberate us from cliche 'has become one' with her first major full length offering.   The two stand out tracks on offer have already been released prior to the cd, one as a single and the other on the Sex and the City soundtrack. So, with the exception of the glorious gospel track 'Jesus Promised Me a Home Over There', the remaining  songs are anticlimactic, directionless, redundant fodder - replicating everything you never wanted to hear again from neo sou.  And did we really need another release of \\"And I am Telling You'? Pulling the \\"Dreamgirls\\" card didn't trump jack on this disc. Surely a diva of this stature would have had the choice of some major musical offerings to pack her pipes into for this important release. Where are they?  I think back to debuts by the likes of  Jill Scott, Me'Shell, Lauren Hill, Erykah Badu and Chrissette Michele, and the voice that should have and could have joined the ranks of these ladies who transformed the genre has, with this self titled dropping, perhaps become America's First False Idol. Plastic Soul!
0596007124|5.0|This was my first book from Head First, and i love it! The book uses an easy approach (besides the schema in each chapter) to make you understand the different patterns. I think the book is good for junior and mid senior people.
031606792X|5.0|I had to add my own 5 star review if only to discount one of the 1 star reviews.  I have read a lot of the negative reviews and I find it hilarious that people are so freaked out about Bella marrying and having a baby at 18.  Hello, you are reading a book about VAMPIRES, and therefore, you left reality at page 1.  I also do not understand the issue with Jacob providing part of the narration, especially during Bella's pregnancy. Can you imagine if Bella or Edward had been the narrator of that section?  It would be about pain and torture both physical (Bella) and mental (Edward).  At least Jake has some wit and sarcasm about him, his comments on the psychopathic blonde had me laughing out loud.  And finally, all the whining about a happy ending is ridiculous, I am still annoyed with JK Rowling for killing off Lupin, Tonks and Fred in the last installment of HP.  If you want to read about reality, its called a NEWSPAPER.  Otherwise, take the vampire book for what it is, a fantasy with all the trimmings!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is the absolute greatest TV series in existance!  And we don't even like TV that much!  Watched this and the second season, now we are anxiously awaiting Sunday nights!  You MUST check this show out, even if you just rent the first disc.  We did and had to purchase the whole season immediately.  It is different, funny and horrifying all at the same time!
0060922583|5.0|I first read this book about ten years ago. It was recommended by my daughter after I went into a time of life when I was really interested in spiritual matters (I was just over 60 then). It made a difference in my thinking then and recently my wife and I started reading it again, together. She had heard me reference it so many times in conversations with others, she decided she wanted to know more. I had had a personal experience with the phenomenon of mind-over-matter following an accident and it was illuminating to learn of others that had similar experiences. If you are not threatened to explore spirituality in a broad sense you will be enlightened by the thoughts in this well documented book. It was written for the lay person and does an excellent job of describing and unifying recent developments in physics, biology, psychology and philosophy.
B001HAOADU|4.0|I was hoping Eric Kripke would dig into the backstory on John and Mary Winchester, but I'd almost set aside the hope, since it seemed a bit of a stretch to pull this off without disrupting the novel-like feel to the set up of the series. But... with an angel now as a recurring character in the series, the possibilities are expanded.<br /><br />I'll admit, at first it was a bit of a stretch for me when it turns out Mary Winchester had ties to the kind of life John later would lead, but I rode with the idea and I'm glad I did: what at first seemed hokey winds up becoming the stuff of Greek tragedy. There's a few flaws: some of the slang in the dialogue isn't the sort of terminology that would have been used in the 1970s, but it's a minor thing I can easily set aside. Good, solid episode and while it fills in some of the backstory as to why the Yellow-Eyed Demon came for Sam as an infant in the first place, it still leaves you with a lot of questions that you're looking forward to seeing answered as the season unfolds...
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|I can't remember this feeling of dread after leaving a movie theater since SE7EN and it's not that I don't think this is a very good movie, it's just that as much as I did read how intense it was before seeing it, I now realize I simply had no idea what I was about to go through. After a terrific chase scene involving several truck's and the Bat-cycle (or however you want to call it) I started to think perhaps we were at the end of the movie, little did I know the entirety of Act III was still ahead of us and with it the floor was about to be taken from under our feet again and again. When I saw the Joker coming out of a Hospital, dressed like a nurse and casually blowing it up I couldn't believe we were talking about a PG-13 movie (I guess we're way past post-9/11 sensibilities by now). Maybe repeated future viewings on DVD will soften the impact of this movie but if you haven't seen it, just know there are films \\"not for children\\" and there is THE DARK KNIGHT, the most intense film in years.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The miniseries set my wife and I to thinking; how do the current candidates, and their superfluous, pandering rhetoric, measure up to the sacrifice and leadership of the Founding Fathers?  What we hear from our candidates today is pandering tripe.  This series puts today's dumb-downed politicians in stark constrast to Adams and the other Revolutionaries who risked everything on behalf of real principles.  What a notion that is in this day and age.  Watch this miniseries if you like an excellent story, and to remind yourself why we are whom we are.
B000007PSR|1.0|I will be polite and refrain from saying what my true opinion is of this CD and Syd Barrett.
B00006AW2L|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. Aftermath and Between The Buttons. Buy them together. That should be required. What an incredibly prolific period for the Stones and what great songs and albums - released within about 6 months of each other. \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Lady Jane\\"  and  \\"Under My Thumb\\". Wow. Very cool. Then there are other great tracks like \\"Think\\", \\"Flight 505\\"  and \\"I Am Waiting\\".   At this point in a lot of band's careers they are starting to run a little thin on material, what is remarkable about this period and this work is that the Stones are actually just getting warmed up. A lot of band's would have been happy to point to such a period in their career as their high water mark. Again, the Stones were just warming up. Aftermath and Between the Buttons - two more examples of the depth and greatness of this band.
B000JCETC4|5.0|I purchased this to add to my Pink Floyd collection. It still remains in it's original form with the plastic shipping cover. The best Pink Floyd Concert was held in 1988 in Dallas Texas. I was in the front row of the Concert. Why they chose to never release this in a DVD form puzzles me to this day. David Gilmore is unequaled as a lead guitar player.
B00006AW2G|5.0|I am the Stones Authority. This is my personal favorite. Everything from the album artwork, the inner sleeve that came with the vinyl that admonishes the listener to play the record loud, to the opening track, which in my opinion is not only the best Rolling Stones song, period, but the best representation of what a rock song should be in general - the incomparable \\"Gimme Shelter\\". If you could only pick one song as the best in the genre then in my mind \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is it. Again, there are others who make the case for the album and the individual tracks - and they do a fine job. So I have nothing to add - be sure to read their reviews for the history and critiques, as most of them are quite good and insightful.    And I will not debate which is the better album, Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed - I will leave that debate to others. My position is stated above. It is subjective. The two albums are very different from one another, but there is little doubt that these are the two best Stones albums. People can have their personal favorites, but no serious fan or critic of the Stones can be taken seriously if the say that the best Stones album is not one of these two albums. Period.    However, what I must address here, as I did with my review of Sticky Fingers, is what kind of rope are the 13 reviewers who rated this album as 1 Star smoking? What sort of scarey and abysmal music collection adorns their rooms and iPods?  What, pray tell, rates a 5 Star album in their world? Is there any endeavor in their lives in which they engage in that others actually take them seriously? Are they allowed to influence others? These are the important questions that must be asked. Again, if this album is not in your collectin or you are not at least familiar with this work then you have no business discussing music as a serious subject with others. Period.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|I've got to be honest, I was skeptical about this film as I wasn't sure the could do this legendary Marvel character justice. The turning point was when my own father (who's around 60) went to the film and liked it! I then said, \\"I've got to see this one now!\\"    I am glad I did! While it isn't an Oscar winner, it is definitely for action lovers and comic fans! Robert Downey, Jr. definitely had Tony Stark down cold! A selfish industrialist who is forced to change his ways and outlook on life after an attack leaves his body shattered and forces him to create the machine that would become his \\"costume\\" for justice as Iron Man.    Terrance Howard, Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow do a great job as their respective characters. I've personally never thought of Paltrow as hot but she did change my mind with the shape she got herself in for this film! HMMM!    Back to the movie, this isn't a waste of money. That's for sure! Buy it today!
B00006AW2J|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. This is a very special album for a number of reasons. It is the first album of the Stones second era. It is really the first post Brian Jones album. Sure he was there for the sessions, but so was the janitor, and that doesn't make him relevant. And, even though this is 1968, it is in a way the first post Sixties album by the Stones. This was the album that defined what the new Rolling Stones band would be as it transitioned to the Seventies, while the other great acts of the Sixties were coming apart or finding it impossible to make the transition to relevancy outside the context of the Sixties, this album established the fact that the Stones would remain relevant for some time to come. They would survive - and before this album this was not at all a certainty. This album is the Rolling Stones grown up, mature and very, very good at what they do. The album represents a watershed in the band's history, and as such many aficionados rate it quite high and sometimes as their best album ever. I understand their emotion, but outside of its context, which is how all work should be judged in my humble opinion, is it relevant to another listener who is not a product of the context in which the work is done? I appreciate Mozart. I understand that his work is great. I do not have an understanding of the context in which the work was composed. The music is so good that it transcends the limitations of my understanding. Beggars Banquet is a very good album in any context. It is one of their four best albums. It is not their best. It is not their second best. They would get even better. Much better. I do love this album and for these songs: \\"No Expectations\\", \\"Parachute Woman\\", \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\", \\"Stray Cat Blues\\", \\"Factory Girl\\" and \\"Salt Of The Earth\\".  The others are not too bad either. A must have album for the serious rock music fan.<br /><br />NOTE: This review keeps getting dogged because of my comments about Brian Jones. Hey, I love Brian too, buthe wasted man. He made no meaningful contribution to this album. I could have shaken the maracas for crying out loud! Watch the damn movie if you don't believe me - Jean Luc Godard. This is a good and fair review. Get serious already. It's a great album, but it is not Sticky Fingers or Let It Bleed, it is not even Exile. But it is beautiful and sadly, Brian had nothing much to do with it, but for the photo session. Grow up.
B0010ZR160|3.0|Let's get one thing out of the way first: if profanity in movies bothers you, don't watch this one. According to the director's commentary, there are over 200 swear words in the movie, to the point where it's almost a distraction early on. I'm not sure what the point of that was, since the book doesn't have nearly that many, and books don't have to go before rating boards. This is definitely not one for the whole family to watch.    Which brings me to my main problem with the movie: I've read the book. It's the fourth book in a series by Dennis Lehane, the author of Mystic River. The five books follow private detectives Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro, and they're some of my favorite suspense/mystery novels. Not many authors can tell stories like these while simultaneously exploring their characters to the depth that Lehane does. One who does a similar job is Stephen R. Donaldson, but that's another review.    I know it's not fair to blame a movie for not having everything the book has, or for being less complex, so I'm trying not to do that. I know if you tried to faithfully reproduce these books on film, you'd need several hours (which is why I think most novels should be TV miniseries, not feature films). But some things about the characters still bothered me.    Casey Affleck, who plays Patrick, is just too young and pretty. In the books, Patrick is regularly beaten up or shot. He's 35-40 years old, and feeling the aches and pains of a life with too many hard knocks. (Lehane even said he took a break from writing about Patrick and Angie when he looked back at the books and saw how much of a beating he'd been giving them, and decided they deserved a break.) Affleck does a good acting job, but it's a different character; I don't think he ever even gets a split lip.    Angela is even worse. In the books, although we see the story through Patrick's eyes, he and Angela are very much equal partners, and she's saved his bacon as often as the reverse. Here, although Michelle Monaghan looks pretty much exactly like Angie looked in my head, she's practically a mouse except for a couple scenes. She mostly just tails along with Patrick, and when they have their big disagreement at the end, it comes out of nowhere. (Starting with the fourth book really hurts here, because there's no history to explain where they're coming from.) Looking at the reviews, some people didn't even know if she was Patrick's wife, assistant, or what. That character was a major disappointment in the way it was written.    Almost as disappointing is Bubba. Lehane describes him as \\"six feet four inches, 235 pounds of raw adrenaline and disassociated anger. And he'd shoot anyone who blinked at [Patrick] the wrong way.\\" Movie Bubba is a fat kid who shows some menace, but nowhere near the barely controlled mayhem of the real Bubba. He's a fairly standard Hollywood drug dealer, and we never get any indication of the way he feels about Patrick and Angie. No time for that, I suppose.    So if you want a great story, with deeply drawn characters who go through the wringer, get the books, starting with A Drink Before the War. Having said that, the movie is pretty good in its own right. The crime plot is scaled way back, and isn't any easier to understand for being simpler, but it's still suspenseful and entertaining. The way it was shot in Boston with a lot of locals as extras gives it a \\"real\\" feel that serves the story well. I'm not usually a person who notices direction unless it's bad, but I think Ben Affleck did a good job here.    I like Casey's voice-overs; his voice matches the character better than his looks. Amy Ryan is good as the mother of the kidnapped girl, although I was surprised to see she was nominated for an Oscar for mostly acting stoned and crying a lot. Her character is more likable here than in the book, but she's still easy to loathe, which is critical.    The real star might be Ed Harris, who plays his character to the hilt. He's electrifyingevery time he's on screen. It's too bad that some of the plot simplification required scaling back his character, so his motivation ends up being much simpler than it was originally, but it's still a great performance. Come to think of it, I don't know if I've ever seen a bad performance from him.    I'm giving it three stars, for people who can take the profanity. It might deserve more than that, but it's hard for me to see past how much better it could have been, if they'd been more faithful in reproducing the characters, especially Angie and Bubba. Maybe someday someone will do the series right, starting at the beginning and using TV to accommodate the full stories. Until then, this is a serviceable take on it.
B00006AW2M|4.0|I am the Stones Authority. I make no apologies. I like this album. This album has some of the best tracks ever recorded by the Rolling Stones. It has a couple of their worst too. But there are four songs that make having it a must.  \\"Citadel\\" - One of their best hard rock tunes and one of the best lyrics written about the modern urban experience. \\"2000 Man\\" - Again, a fantastic song that was thirty years ahead of its time, predicting that men would have love affairs with their computers. Anyone hear of Facebook, MySpace or YouTube? Fantastic and prescient lyrics. \\"She's A Rainbow\\" - Just a damn cool sounding song. Who has got a problem with that song? Get off the bus then! \\"2000 Light Years From Home\\" - That is a rock song, that is out there, it is intense. Did you see them perform it live during the Steel Wheels tour? If you missed it, then you missed amazing magic. There are some others like Bill Wyman's outing \\"In Another Land\\" that are interesting and cool, But those four tracks that I just mentioned mean that you have to have the album. You must respect this album.     Unfortunately the cover is goofy in light of Sgt. Peppers and a picture of almost anything else would have been a better choice. The album is tainted by the cover art. Don't look at the cover when you listen to the album and you should be okay. Oh, and if you are not wired real tight, don't drink the purple Kool-Aid on the first pass either.
031606792X|5.0|[...]<br />The relationship between Edward and Bella is finally [...]  This is a work of fiction - does anyone truly need to know the mechanics of whether his venom could fertilize a human egg?  Just attribute this to the portion of the story that states that only a few vampire/human half-breeds exist, a reason why they don't understand the possibility or what to expect.  I'm happy to finally see Edward completely and totally happy.  As a member of Team Edward, I hated his weakness whenever he felt he was putting Bella at risk.  And finally, I am so glad to see Bella as a strong young lady. So tired of seeing her needy, weak and insecure personality.  I'm glad to see she finally realized she is beautiful and strong.<br /><br />I loved the vampire/werewolf storyline in this installment.  I also enjoyed the new Edward-Bella relationship that develops after she turns.  The return of the Volturi and a wealth of vampires added to the storyline as well.  I actually didn't have a problem with Jacob's imprinting on Renesmee, probably because I actually read the prior novel where Quill discussed his dilemma.  Regardless, sometimes things happen in life we have no control over, as was the case of his imprinting.<br /><br />An interesting element to this story was Jacob's perspective.  I found it refreshing (at first) to read a different point of view other than Bella's.  However, I found myself wanting to return to Bella's narration to see what she was experiencing during her transformation.  I am extremely interested in seeing if this will ever make the big screen.  The 'delivery' scene was a little graphic compared to the other elements the reader has become accustomed to throughout the saga.<br /><br />Twilight was the intro, New Moon the build, Eclipse the crescendo, and finally, Breaking Dawn the climactic end.  The problem is, with such as strong following as the fanfare of Twilight, there is no way Meyer could have written a finish that would please all readers.  Personally, I loved Breaking Dawn and felt it tied up the loose ends presented throughout the other novels.wn and felt it tied up the loose ends presented throughout the other novels.

031606792X|3.0|First of all, I have to say that I loved the Twilight series.  Twilight got me hooked, New Moon brought in the beginning of a great love triangle, and Eclipse was great, written so well, and so much look forward to in Breaking Dawn.  However, Breaking Dawn fell flat in my opinion.        The book started off great.  Then you get to Jacobs part and yes, I must say it was great.  But what wasnt great was the fact that this book is approximately 750 pages and we are over and done with the first and second part before the halfway point of the book.  Now we have another 350 pages for Stephanie Meyer to ramble on and on.  There was so much filler garbage that I got hugely annoyed while reading.  I'm sorry to say, but the battle scene (what battle scene) at the end of the book was cheesy and very dissappointing and it took forever to get there.  Also, what happens to these characters?  Is she actualy planning on writing a 5th book?  Everywhere I look, it says this is the last book, but Breaking Dawn kind of just ends.  No offense Stephanie Meyer, but J.K. Rowling could show you a thing or two.
B000A5044C|5.0|This movie is going straight to my favorites. It definitely grabs at your heart strings. Overall the film is long, the story slow, so it's not for you extreme action fans. What really captured my attention is that from the way it's filmed, and the actors, it just feels so real.    I recommend giving it a try. As for the DVD itself, video quality is perfect, worked just great, shipment was fast (so fast in fact it surprised me), and it's affordable.
0689854684|5.0|This is an excellent book. I highly recommend adding it to your classic<br />collection.<br />It is great reading for older children or adults.

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|I didn't actually buy this album for myself, despite being an average Coldplay fan for a number of years. I thought their first couple of albums had some good tracks here and there. I bought this album for my girlfriend's daughter as she really loved the song Vida La Vida. I burned myself a copy and listened to it on the way home, WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!!! Not one song grabbed my attention, even the overhyped and overplayed main track blows! I wound up throwing the burned CD right in the trash when I got home, completely sucks in my opinion! Radiohead's new release is about 100 times better than this crap!

0375842209|5.0|I read the first few pages of this book standing in line at the bookstore.  The beginning was mysterious, but started to paint a picture of a narrator that seemed defeated.  The narrator turns out to be Death, speaking to us from the Nazi Germany during WW2.  Death, ironically, is afraid of humans.  This set the book off with a delightfully fresh concept.    The story is not meant to be a complex one, though there are a number of complex themes in the book.  It involves Death, who comes to us during a busy time for him in world history--the Second World War.  He follows the story of a young girl who goes to live with a foster family.  The simplicity of following her development, her friends, her foster parents, and her time in the Hitler Youth make this book very honest.  Though there is a clear plot, revealed partially in the beginning and unfolded properly by the end of the book, the characters that are established are what I particularly enjoyed.    Some of the themes of this book are Death (obviously) and the human reaction to it (Him?) and words--Hitler is known to be a master of words and propaganda and the girl followed in the book learns to read and write through (mostly) stolen books.  She shows a parallel power of words as Death learns her story mostly through the book she wrote.    The book is tragic at times, but still ends without leaving the reader feeling empty.  If you read this book, don't expect Heaven and Earth to be moved.  Read it to meet the characters and, possibly, grow to care for them.  I had never heard of it before I saw it in the bookstore.  I read it because the first few pages drew me in.  I only found out about the hype after the fact.  No expectations and reading just to enjoy it are the way to go with this book.  It is simple, subtle, and astonishingly good.
B000UJQ24E|4.0|Whitesnake has two main era/styles - the shredding, flashy, hair metal group (with a revolving lineup) that got them famous in America at the end of the 80's, and the blues based (sometimes hard-) rock of the late 70's, early 80's, with a relatively steady band.  The earlier days can be even more broken down between the first couple albums, with Duck Dowle on drums, and the more riffy hard-rock of the Ian Paice albums.  This one kind of bridges that gap.  There's a lot of heavily grooving blues-rock goin' on here, some fantastic singing from David Coverdale (whose rich voice here was quite the opposite of his later, screaming, Robert Plant-inspired style), and a couple nice acoustic and ballady tracks.  I might point out that I don't generally like metal ballads from the late 80's on - songs like \\"Now You're Gone\\" and \\"Is This Love\\" kind of bore me, but Coverdale's early singing (as on this album) is so wonderful, plus the fact that the songwriting and musicianship in the early Whitesnake was so full of feeling, that it make me really enjoy these songs.
B00005JPO1|5.0|Look, I am not here to review anything.  I just want to give input.  In a world where crap movies reign it is good to see characters come back that we grew up with.  It is not important whether or not the story is top notch, on the edge of your seat fantastic.  I believe Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull was made for nostalgic reasons.  It brings out the kid in us when we all watched him for the first time and all wanted to be him. Fedora hat, leather jacket, bull whip.  Right now with the world feeling like it is falling apart, i.e. gas prices, global economy, it is nice to come back to a character we know and love.  Indiana Jones makes us feel safe in a world that feels unsafe.  He is familiar and he is like home to us.  Look beyond the movie and one sided views and you can see what I mean.      This movie was just the perfect way to say goodbye to a beloved icon.
B00005ASHM|5.0|As a landlocked kid growing up without ready access to beaches or a car, I had a hard time relating to the Beach Boys. Their celebrations of sun, surfing, and hot-rodding were too removed from my own experience. It wasn't until I got older that I appreciated them. Songs that had once sounded frivolous suddenly revealed multiple layers of emotions which had previously eluded me.    Mind you, that wasn't true of every Beach Boys song. But classics like \\"Surfer Girl\\" and \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" were wistful and beautiful evocations of love and longing - both questioning and reassuring.    Brian Wilson then outdid himself with his compositions for the landmark 1966 album \\"Pet Sounds\\" - their apex and finest achievement - and arguably the greatest record ever released by an American band. Paul McCartney has said that if you haven't heard it, your musical education isn't complete. He further said it inspired the Beatles to make \\"Sgt. Pepper\\". I don't really hear \\"Pet Sounds\\" influence on that record, but I do on \\"Abbey Road\\" - especially on tracks like \\"Because\\" and \\"Here Comes The Sun King\\".    This CD contains the full album in mono and stereo. Wilson's musical and vocal arrangements still sound stunning to this day. If for any reason you've resisted buying this, you shouldn't. At the very minimum, any serious music fan should own \\"Pet Sounds\\" and a good collection of their hits such as \\"Sounds Of Summer\\" (2003).    Wilson's solo career has also been of interest. \\"Brian Wilson\\" (1988) was a good one. So was the belatedly completed \\"Smile\\" (2004), which was originally intended as the follow-up to \\"Pet Sounds\\" - wherein he proved himself to be a latter-day Gershwin. \\"Smile\\" collaborator Van Dyke Parks and Wilson had previously released the excellent \\"Orange Crate Art\\" (1995). Recently, Wilson issued \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" (2008), another innovative song suite in the style of \\"Smile\\" - and it's fine. All are highly recommended.    Whether you live in California or not, don't missout on the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.

This is supposed to be for the Blu-ray disc, which doesn't get released until Dec.9--how can anyone review something that's two months out?  Why can't people stop jumping the gun and just review the product, in this case the BLU-RAY DISC OF THE DARK KNIGHT? Review features, transfer, extras, etc.  You know, that's what these reviews are supposed to be for.  If we want a review of the film, we'll go to the appropriate place.  Those of us shopping and researching products on amazon.com would like to get the skinny on the actual product--in this case, THE DISC!
B0001XAPY2|4.0|Porco Rosso (Hayao Miyazaki, 1992)<br /><br />In between his two monolithic environmentalist efforts, Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki enjoyed his greatest artistic success as a filmmaker, in my opinion. (Cue legions of Spirited Away fans who disagree.) Not only his best picture, Kiki's Delivery Service, but My Neighbor Totoro and Porco Rosso were also produced during this time. That's a trifecta of which any director could be proud.<br /><br />Porco Rosso tells the story of, not surprisingly, the Crimson Pig, a 1920s pilot with a dark past. After a mishap, he takes his plane to get it repaired in Italy, where he's wanted by the army. They find out he's home, and the hijinks begin.<br /><br />It's actually quite simple and straightforward for a Miyazaki film, which was something of a surprise. A good old swashbuckling adventure flick about daredevil flyers, honor, and friendship. Think of it as Wings: The Animated Version and you won't be too far wrong. *** ½
B0000041XX|5.0|This is a most enjoyable cd.  The music selection is varied, creative and powerful.  I think this concert was so special.  I'm not particularly classical music oriented, but I did enjoy this music and have listened to the cd many times over.  It is the depth of voices, clearness of notes and the fun the 3 tenors were having that really enchanted me. These three tenors have such a gift to give and do give it most generously. Most of the  songs are classic Italian so that even people like myself who aren't necessarily opera buffs will enjoy hearing these voices even if they cannot understand a word.  Most likely I will order more of this type of music.
B001EC9V58|3.0|(Review originally written May 2008)<br /><br />[REC] (Jaume Balaguero, 2007)<br /><br />I immediately became concerned when I found out this was written and directed by Jaume Balaguero, whose Darkness was one of 2002's biggest disappointments, but after I was done, I didn't hate [REC] nearly as much as I'd feared I would. Think of it as Night of the Living Cloverfield and you'll get the basic idea-- Angela (Manuela Velasco), a TV host, and her cameraman are tagging along with Manu (Ferran Teraza) and Alex (David Vert), a pair of firefighters, who go to an apartment block to help a woman who's stuck in her apartment-- or so they're told. They find out the police are already at the location, and that things are a bit more complex than they were told-- the woman is a homicidal maniac, and kills one of the police officers while the camera's rolling. Soon afterwards, the disease runs rampant through the apartment building, which has been cordoned off by the police, who won't let anyone out. The entire film is as seen through the TV camera filming the segment.<br /><br />It's won a ton of awards, including Best Film at this year's Fantasporto, and I have to say that as an entrant in the current rash of first-person-POV films, it does hold its own. It's easy to see why these movies are popular with filmmakers; you can get away with a lot of plot holes and bad information when everything's shot from one point of view. After all, all the good stuff usually happens outside the camera's range. (As per Cormac McCarthy and the Coen Brothers, natch.) This does tend to make some of the coincidences into a real stretch (though a TV show hostess who aspires to do hard news could be spurred into investigative journalism even when she's terrified and hysterical, I guess...), but when your plot devices are that transparent, it's more of a \\"screw you and your suspension of disbelief\\" to the viewer, and I have to grudgingly admit I like the attitude, in small doses. It does play better when you're already wrapped into the movie, as is the case here; Balaguero plays it off with previous endless blathering by some of the more obnoxious survivors postulating about the cause of the disease (one old racist who blames it on the Chinese is alternately hysterical and horrifying).<br /><br />One does have to wonder, given the juxtaposition of the release dates, whether Balaguero and J. J. Abrams were in contact with one another at all while filming [REC] and Cloverfield. The two movies do have a great deal in common, down to the composition of some shots being almost identical (save one being set in a Spanish apartment building and one being set in New York City). It's even better when you throw in Romero's Diary of the Dead, which takes the same approach, and saw its first screening just a week after [REC]; the latter premiered at the Venice Film Festive on August 29, 2007, while the former premiered at the Toronto Film Festival on September 8, 2007. This sort of thing is not uncommon, varous directors glomming onto an idea at the same time, but it's pretty rare for all the films involved to be at least partial successes (sometimes they all suck; witness Mission to Mars and Red Planet coming out the same year, and both being entirely unwatchable dreck). In this case, I think they all do work, as long as you're simply looking for a survival-horror-action flick. I must agree with my compatriot nachtritter; if you turn your brain off and ignore all the stupid, this is a fun, fun movie, in exactly the same way Cloverfield was. It's certainly the best Balaguero film I've seen to date. ***<br /><br />Postscript: needless to say, an American remake is already being shot (Quarantine, slated for release on October 10, 2008).

B000O599WG|3.0|Rio Bravo (Howard Hawks, 1959)<br /><br />I've heard a few times that Rio Bravo was an ultra-right-wing response to High Noon. I'm not terribly sure about all that, but having watched the two films without a month or so of each other now, High Noon is the clear winner from the simple standpoint of being a good movie. Because of the back-and-forth, I feel like blaming the message. Problem is, there's not really much of a message to blame; while Rio Bravo certainly isn't a bad movie by any standards, both John Wayne and director Howard Hawks were capable of far superior work, and showed that many times.<br /><br />John T. Chance (Wayne) is the sheriff of your typical small western town besieged by bad guys, in this case the Burdette Brothers, Nathan (John Russell) and Joe (Claude Akins), and their string of hired guns. The trouble starts when Chance, his all-but-useless deputy Borrachon (Dean Martin-- \\"Borrachon\\" is a nickname, of course, the word is Spanish for \\"drunk\\". An inspired piece of casting, there!), and their old-geezer flunky Stumpy (Walter Brennan) lock Joe up. Nathan responds by killing a local rancher, and one of his hands, a young firebrand named Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson), wants in on the revenge. This, of course, sets up musical numbers with Nelson and Martin (and who knew Walter Brennan could sing?). It also sets up the big gunfight at the climax. It's not a spoiler. How often do you see a western that doesn't have a big gunfight at the end?<br /><br />It's certainly not a bad movie; I'm not sure Hawks was capable of making a bad movie. Nor was Wayne, once he got out from under the heel of Lone Star in the thirties. And while this is a well-acted and well-paced movie, it's pretty typical genre stuff, save the musical numbers. Howard Hawks is not Vicente Minnelli, and I'm not sure he should've ever tried to be. Still, if you're in the mood for a wetsern, and all your library's copies of High Noon are out, give this a shot. (I should say, by the way, that I'm as much a conservative as either Wayne or Hawks ever were-- and I still prefer High Noon). ***ervative as either Wayne or Hawks ever were-- and I still prefer High Noon). ***
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I was first aware of Jennifer Hudson from the Dreamgirls movie. I was really impressed; saw the movie in the theater about 7 times or so. Was really anticipating her CD, but was not impressed initially because my expectation of what I thought she with Clive Davis would produce was larger than life. When I finally settled down and really listened to the CD, I fell in love with it. Each song is perfectly placed on the CD and brings the right emotion at the right time. I continue to be a fan of Jennifer Hudson and look forward to her concert tour; please come to Richmond VA.
B00110K62U|3.0|The performances are unquestionably good.   But...my expectations were set--perhaps unfairly--high due to the fact that I'd first received and listened to the symphonic version Les Miz cd. (Which contains every note and lyric from the play.)  So, while I enjoyed what this dvd contained, I was equally disappointed by scenes and sequences which were omitted. As another reviewer mentioned, some of the omissions were particularly jarring, such as having the first third of \\"Little People\\" clumsily lopped off.  I was somewhat mollified by the special features cd, which contains some nice clips from stage productions around the world.
B000RW3VD4|4.0|Writer-director Oliver Stone aptly depicts the culture of corporate greed and those who lead that rat pack in an exploration of the morality of placing profits over people.<br /><br />Michael Douglas does a superb job in portraying corporate raider Gordon Gecko, a 1980s-era, larger-than-life figure who will stop at nothing to quench his thirst professionally and personally. Charlie Sheen is the young Wall Street broker who beats the odds to become a protege of this iconic figure, but becomes entwined in a web trust, truth and doing the right thing with his blue-collar father, played by Martin Sheen.<br /><br />The white-collar party seems to have no end, as those willing to play the game by day will be rewarded with riches that millions can only dream about. Life mirrors art as the price of pop culture glory is played off the harsh ramifications to the faceless living paycheck-to-paycheck on Main Street.<br /><br />It is - sadly - a timeless theme when Wall Street becomes a bunker for the greedy few  and not an avenue for the many.
B001C4AFP8|5.0|Films involving 'current events'--particularly those relating to anything happening in the Middle East and Terrorism--tend to be soaked in the writers', producers' and director's politics, which usually end up very much in-your-face and spoil the film, because you suddenly lose the story and drown in the preaching and proselytizing.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, who has already addressed the West-East/Christianity-Islam issue in a previous film, 'Kingdom of Heaven', this time bit the bullet (instead of the sword) and continued KoH's story about 1000 years later. 'Body of Lies' is very much a Ridley Scott movie and this translates into the film's politics as well. Thing is, you can't leave politics out of a political movie; and so what do you do?<br /><br />Well, here's a newsflash for the poli-preachers on all sides: it's possible to have it all, and just watch Ridley Scott do it. Just like KoH, it's all about even-handedness and realizing that (1) every side in a conflict has a point of view, which, to itself, is perfectly valid; and (2) every side has people you'd probably like and some you really wouldn't, (3) the way to peace lies with understanding (1) and (2); and not with having just one point of view, no matter how righteous it may appear. Both, Islamophobes and Islamophiles--or those on the extremes of any aspect of the political spectrum--will probably find ample elements to dislike about this film. Others of a more moderate and even-handed disposition will find much to like and appreciate.<br /><br />All of this, rather profound, stuff is wrapped up in a gritty Ridley Scott production and direction, that keeps your full attention for its full 2+ hours. Leonardo DiCaprio has really grown up and cast off his annoying persona, which was so prominent in just about all his movies; until 'Blood Diamond' came along. Russell Crowe is basically a secondary character, eclipsed almost completely by DiCaprio and Mark Strong. The latter has come a long way since I first saw him in the BBC production of Jane Austen's 'Emma'. The gentle and understated romance element provided by Golshifteh Farahani as 'Aisha' provided a nice contrast to the testosterone-soaked male world in which this drama plays out.<br /><br />The movie confirms what I've known for a long time: Ridley Scott apparently can do no wrong.ion of Jane Austen's 'Emma'.

B0019T9FL6|3.0|I really liked Jennifer Hudson on American Idol (she wasn't my favorite but she definitely had talent), and I really think she was the best thing to happen to Dreamgirls.  Needless to say, her renditions of \\"Love You I Do\\" and \\"I Am Changing\\" are, in my opinion, sheer perfection.  So I waited anxiously for this album to be released.  Now that it has, I have to say it could have been much better.    The main problem with the album is that a lot of the material is just not good.  It sounds like these songs were meant to follow trends and get people to buy the album, not be an album to listen to for years and years.  Furthermore, a lot of the songs that probably should have worked (such as \\"I'm His Only Woman\\" and \\"Pocketbook\\") don't because they are too contrived and obvious in their intention.      But despite these glaring  problems, there are some shining moments.  \\"You Pulled Me Through\\" is an inspiring song that can really lift your spirits, \\"Giving Myself\\" (in my opinion one of the best songs on the collection) is very sexy and romantic, \\"If This Isn't Love\\" is pretty catchy, and \\"Spotlight\\" is a song that is really fun.     There are other good things about this album, but they are not enough to make this album more than a 3-star effort.  Jennifer Hudson is a fantastic singer, and I will give her a second chance when she releases another album, but this release could have (and should have) been a timeless classic in the realm of debuts from Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, and Sade.  Instead, we get a throwaway meant to cash in on the trends of the time.

B000FVQM2Y|4.0|I caught this movie late at night and stayed up until 2 to finish it.  I was drawn in by Gordon-Levitt and the kinetic pacing.  It reminded me a bit of River's Edge, another film that pulls you into its web.  At times you sorta feel like you're watching, Fight Club, or Guy Richie film, but then it comes back to the characters and that is what makes this film different.  Lukas Haas is prefectly cast, and when he sort of pops up, it's like, finally somebody is using this talent young character actor, I really dont understand how, Shia LaBouef gets so much work and somebody like Haas, is rarely seen, but I digress, anyway, Haas really sets the pace for the latter half of the film.  Without getting into the specifics of the film, (FYI, I loathe when reviewers practically recite the screenplay word for word) I will say that it is story of a loner, Gordon-Levitt, his love for a girl that is unrequinted, the mystery surrounding her, and Gordon-Levitts pursuit of the truth, through a maze of blowback.  Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.

B000F7CMQ8|4.0|Ava Gardner could hardly be considered anyone's second choice, but this is what director John Ford and screenwriter John Lee Mahin would have you believe in this overripe 1952 safari melodrama. Yet, she is the primary reason why this film is still worth a look 56 years later. Far more intuitively than Angelina Jolie these days, Gardner epitomized a primal sensuality and a hidden vulnerability, the combination of which was intoxicating in her prime. Ford captures this, as well as her dark beauty and sharp comedy sense, by casting her as smart-mouthed, carefree playgirl Eloise \\"Honey Bear\\" Kelly, who has come to a remote African outpost to meet up with a wealthy maharajah. Finding herself stood up, she is greeted by no-nonsense big game hunter Victor Marswell as she conveniently takes a shower al fresco. Before sparks can truly fly, a young British anthropologist and his prudish wife, Donald and Linda Nordley, arrive naively drawn to the flora and fauna.<br /><br />Then a rather preposterous story turn occurs in which Marswell becomes smitten with Mrs. Nordley, and she with him since she swoons over the manly hunter over her milquetoast husband. Looking the patrician beauty that served her well during her brief movie career, a 24-year-old Grace Kelly plays Linda in typical melodramatic fashion. Her English accent is a bit overdone, and her character's motivations too simplistically presented for Kelly to shine, especially next to Gardner. As Marswell, the 52-year-old Clark Gable doesn't have quite the swagger he displayed so easily in his youth when he first played this role in 1932's [[ASIN:6301978390 Red Dust]] with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor in the Gardner and Kelly parts. However, it is a testament to his enduring appeal that he is at all convincing as a magnet for two much younger women.<br /><br />But make no mistake that Gable, who has to maintain a stoic, man-of-mystery demeanor as Marswell, really hands the picture to Gardner. In particular, she has a fetching couple of scenes where she sings Robert Burns' \\"Comin' Through the Rye\\" and seems truly to enjoy interacting with the wild animals. It's all a hoot, and the location filming in Kenya and Uganda really brings the story to vibrant life. Ford handles the exotic background as well as he does Monument Valley in his classic westerns, and he makes sure to keep goosing the story with action elements so that the focus is not completely on the love triangle. Industry veteran Robert Surtees and David Lean's favorite cameraman Freddie Young shared cinematography responsibilities, and the look of the film is sumptuous even by MGM's high standards.

0375826726|3.0|Brisingr, the third book of the Inheritance tri/quad/quintology? is written as if the author had had a gun placed to his head during the writing, which in a sense, I suppose he did. The plot is good, with a large amount of deviation from the overall storyline, which amounts to a slow, steady progression of the war of Surda vs. the Empire and Gallabatorix. The story flows well, but the devil crops up in the details.<br /><br />Eragon, the now half-elf Dragon Rider, still reeling from his disastrous fight with Murtagh and Thorn, is sent scampering around the realm, rescuing Katrina from the Ra'zac, serving as emissary to the dwarven confederation while they decide on a new monarch, and being on call to defend the Varden from Thorn and the Empires army. During this time, Eragon tries to make up for past failures, suceeding somewhat, and failing somewhat as well. The detail and precision are a bit scattered, sometimes providing a rich background to the scene, and sometimes glossing over nut and bolts to advance the plot.<br /><br />Paolini however, seems to suffer from a typical condition of series authors. He thinks everyone else is as familiar with the previous books as he is. While I could recall the general storyline of Eragon and Eldest, a synopsis, however brief, would've been a welcome refresher. As its written, you almost have to reread the prior books to be able to appreciate the plot currently being handled. Details, names, and places resurface regularly that make no sense given that theres no context or recap to place them. Dialogue has become more archaic, and sometimes confusing given the characters, with soldiers and random wanderers talking like wizened scholars and philosophers.<br /><br />Magic continues to place the greatest role in the story, and while Paolinis use of it remains rather inventive, there are time when it would've been easier and simplier to deus ex his way through the encounter. Some instances are needlessly confusing or overly complex, although there are other that're rather pleasing for their originality. Paolini needs to pick a happy medium. While I want magic more complex than that of Harry Potter, with thought and planning put into it, making every spell its own Rubiks cube makes the usage of the device clunky and dull.<br /><br />The Inheritance series latest installment is a worthwhile read, but you can almost feel the authors pain through the pages. He tried to make Brisingr too many things to too many people, and wound up with a novel that feels overly stretched and rather bland. That having been said, considering his prior successes, one hopes he takes this stride, and tells his publisher to cram it when it comes to volume 4's release date. So long as he is given time to write what he wishes, I feel confident it will return to his prior standard.although there are other that're rather pleasing for their originality.

B001C4AFP8|3.0|A decidedly deceptive trailer makes Ridley Scott's new covert operations film Body of Lies seem like a battle of wits between Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe. But the film actually delves much deeper into the bedlam of undercover missions, double-crosses and sabotage, and deals nail-biting suspense at every turn. Although the story looks like fuel for a Tony Scott (Ridley's brother) film, ala Spy Game, the sheer intensity, violence, immediacy and realism of the cinematography has Ridley's signature all over it.<br /><br />Based on David Ignatius' 2007 novel about CIA operative Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio), Body of Lies follows his undercover operations based around Iraq, Jordan (Amman), Dubai, Turkey, Syria, the U.S and more. Every move he makes is under aerial surveillance and the vigilant eye of Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), his superior who continually yet unintentionally detrimentally interferes with crucial missions.<br /><br />Every objective for Ferris is surrounded by side missions, conflicting intelligence gathering, and double-crosses from both his government and the Jordan secret police group headed by Hani (Mark Strong). As the media is manipulated along with everyone involved in the uncovering of terrorist bombings across Europe, Ferris invents a fictitious alternate terrorist brotherhood to ferret out Al Saleem, a treacherous man known to be involved with the majority of the anonymous attacks. As Hoffman works to preserve his agents' involvement and Hani feeds his own ego, Ferris is confronted with several shocking revelations and choices that could ultimately lead to the death of his newfound love interest as well as his own.<br /><br />Body of Lies doesn't slow down to let the viewer catch up to all of the fast-talking political jargon, in-depth public opinion trajectory issues, and the guerilla warfare tactics employed by the allegedly unsophisticated enemy. If you miss something, you're on your own. But this breakneck pace coupled with relentless explosions and firefights, fierce chase sequences, grueling torture and continual brushes with death allows for blistering intensity and an experienced examination of suspense. Scott persists with plenty of close-ups that keep audiences on the edge of their seats, afraid of the next bullet or bomb that will certainly strike onscreen.<br /><br />While the structure found within Body of Lies is one not unfamiliar to Scott's films, the flawless acting by both Crowe and DiCaprio paired with an intricate plot of trust and betrayal keeps the anticipation from ever backing down. A few of the twists may be predictable, but the deceptive motives of each character will keep you guessing their reactions until the unsettling conclusion. Body of Lies isn't Scott's best, but it certainly retains the finest elements of the masterful director's style, attention to detail, and cunning build of tension and suspense.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsrefights, fierce chase sequences, grueling torture and continual brushes with death allows for blistering intensity and an experienced examination of suspense.

B00005JMK0|5.0|This movie is for those who grew up in the Computer revolution and arcade games in the 80s. It was dubbed as a \\"Fairytale for Computers\\", with classic music from ELO, Culture Club, Heaven 17 to name a few (BTW grab the OST while its on CD.. its great!).    Boy buys computer, meets girl who lives up stairs, computer gets jealous and wants to meet the girl. Computer come to life? Sure in the 1980's with some campaign spilled on the keyboard.    Now the fun part, I guess there is a licensing issue for the music to get this on DVD. Just like with 1984's \\"Heavy Metal\\" multiple artists and groups have to give it its blessing (and make sure they get the royalties off of it) when it goes to DVD.    So now MGM...PLEASE review this and get this to DVD. You would easily sell 939 copies according to this reviews left here. At $14.95 you can easily make $14038.05 off of sales with more to follow.

Children and teens can read them to laugh at the misadventures of our \\"hero\\"...who's equal parts wimp and miscreant.<br /><br />Rodrick Rules keeps the pace set in the original novel and offers nice segues towards topics like: spending unwanted time with one's mother, playing role-playing games, teen house parties, procrastinating unwanted school projects, being \\"cool\\" in front of girls, and holidays with the relatives.<br /><br />I strongly recommend buying Kinney's books, reading them, and then leaving them lying in places where children/teens might stumble across them.  Reading and laughter become contagious when handled correctly and this author knows exactly how to balance the two!

Lahiri's stories, however, are not limited to immigrant issues but address global issues relevant worldwide: how we need our parents, how we develop our independence, and how we give up that independence to form lasting relationships. More than anything, these stories capture the search for a comfortable identity.<br /><br />Lahiri's writing is rich with detail and complexity, making these short stories seem more like novels that end too soon. Lahiri's style is powerful. There's no sentimentality here but plenty of sensitivity and feeling. Many of these stories contain a hidden element or event of such significance that, when finally revealed at the end of the story, changes everything that came before. It's the shock of these surprising occurrences that makes each story a living, changing experience. Fabulous.

0786888628|5.0|This is a thoroughly researched and overall well written book on the first winter of the Korean War by the late author Halberstam.  He worked on this book for well over a decade, and it shows.  The focus of the book is on the winter of 1950-1951, with a considerable part about the fall of 1950, as the author notes, it is the most interesting part of the war (the remainder was so stagnant it reminds historians of WWI), the book gives a complete explanation of WHY this war dragged on.  Fans of McArthur might want to skip this book, along with those who think Truman was the worst president ever.  Some officers shine, while others are considerably less lustrous.  Halberstam does a nice job looking at the war from all the ranks, from private first class up to the commanders.
B000VNMMR0|3.0|In the sequel-dominated decade that is Hollywood since 1999's release of The Phantom Menace, it was only a matter of time before Bruce Willis put in another Die Hard flick.  This time the bad guys are a collection of international criminals led by an ex-fed genius.  The good guys are led by John McClane of the NYPD, his whiz-kid sidekick, and various feds.  Like previous die-hard movies, we have lots of shooting, a gorgeous bad babe, some fistfights, and of course several helicopters, instead of just one as in the previous Die Hard movies.  The evil chic is played by Maggie Q, though this time we have a lady on the good side, McClane's daughter.  Much of the action takes place at night or in dark confines, so watch carefully or you will miss a lot of details.  Still, worth the 2 hours to watch it.

B001C08RHA|1.0|This is targeted for young people as well as adults, but it has scenes that are completely innapropriate for young teenagers.      I was hoping for an enjoyable hero movie, like Batman Begins, but instead it started with a bedroom sex scene only masked by a sheet.  This is wrong-headed for a teen movie.  Then they made repeated references to him having sex with journalists, again inappropriate for a movie targeted at teens.    Then, Downey's acting was lame. \\"OK, I'm the Iron Man.\\"  What a dumb ending. Nothing like Batman Begins which drew me into the character, or the more plausible technologies used.    Some of the special effects were fine, but it had far too much stupid stuff like:    1) He crash landed in the dessert from like 3,000 feet and didn't get hurt or   2) he had icing problems at 80,000 feet where icing does not occur...it occurs where there's moisture, in clouds, or   3) Downey builds this hi-tech robot suit in a cave without his captors figuring out what he's doing...uh, that was really stupid.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Once more Madonna brings another album that shows that she really has a flawless talent. Every album that she records takes us on a tour of a renovated Madonna but obviuosly, with her same roots.  Her previous album \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" from my point of view was one of her greatest productions, (I found \\"American life\\" not good).  \\"Hard candy\\" has a more commercial sound. It has contribuitions of big names in the american music business such as Pharrell Willimas, Timbaland, Kanye West and Justin Timberlake. All the songs sound fresh and have great rhythms. The opennig track, \\"Candy shop\\" gives the album's tittle and is fun. My favorite track on this album is \\"Give it 2 me\\" next to Pharrell. It is a song that makes you feel like deancing, another great tune is \\"Beat goes on\\" next to Kanye West. \\"Dance 2tonight\\" is one of the songs with less rhythm but still very good. Actually the whole album is very good, after listening it you'll like it more and well,  if you like Madonna there isn't much to say, it is all history.  What I would like to comment as an advice, is that if you are hesitating about either buying the simple or special release version, buy the simple one. I have the special package and it doesn't include anything special. The box is very big (hard to put next to other cd's) and has the same pictures. The only extras are 2 remixes from \\"4 minutes\\" (the remixes are good but nothing really special) and a small bag of candies.

It's no coincidence that while listening to it without the case and insert I thought, \\"Man, she's been really rocking Madlib in the car.  She sounds like she's on some Georgia Anne Muldrow tip, but not as good.\\"  Sure enough, after a few more tracks roll by, I demand to see the cover and who's on it?  Madlib and Georgia.<br /><br />Madlib and Georgia do this style in their sleep and Badu is clearly trying to channel that next level funk that Georgia was doing two years ago.  Unfortunately for her, it doesn't ring as true.  It's clear that she's experimenting with the style, not owning it.  It's not a record without merit, but it isn't a great record either.
0307386171|5.0|As in his previous book SATURDAY, Ian McEwan expands a short amount of time into book length through an intense exploration of the emotions of the characters.  This time around, the time frame is even shorter, a mere evening between Edward and Florence, on their honeymoon the night of their wedding.  Although we begin in a small room where the newlyweds are dining, it is the next room, with the four poster bed waiting, that brings the tension to the fore.  You see, our new husband and wife have, to put it simply, seriously divergent attitudes and expectations about the consummation of their relationship.    Edward can barely hold himself back from pouncing on his beautiful wife, who only hours ago had vowed, in front of numerous witnesses - and in a church, no less - that `with my body, I thee worship.'  Florence, however, is a different matter.  She is a true character study whose feelings on the matter go way, way beyond wedding night jitters.  The thought of the act of penetration is not merely repulsive physically, but repulses and terrifies her at the deepest core of her being.  If she did not exactly lie at the altar, she simply lacked the willpower to be more honest with herself long before the two ever got there.    McEwan's writing is captivating, drawing the reader into the intricacies of the relationship between Edward and Florence, as well as their backgrounds and personalities that provide the context of it.  The action unfolds at an agonizingly slow pace, with McEwan drawing very narrow margins for emotional error.  As in SATURDAY, one cannot help but be struck at how even a small decision has such large emotional consequences.    ON CHESIL BEACH takes place in 1962, prior to the sexual revolution.  Yet it is difficult to imagine how that revolution would have produced a different outcome.  Yes, Edward and Florence could not communicate, both wound tight within the cultural expectations of the time.  Yet the problem obviously goes much deeper, to the issue of exactly what is not being communicated.  Perhaps at a later date, the events of the book would never have taken place, as their incompatibility would have come to light long before it reached this point.  Setting the book at a later date would have made it more unrealistic.  And although painful to read at times, ON CHESIL BEACH's realism is all too stark.  I highly recommend it.

B000003TAB|5.0|This was MY Nirvana album I was listenening to in Jr. High... Nevermind was great, but that was the polished up multi-platinum monster that made them famous, everone heard \\"Come as you are\\" or \\"Teen Spirit\\"... but these were the gems to me \\"Dive\\", \\"Sliver\\" \\"Mexican Seafood\\"... those songs are the ones that take me back... to the good ol' days.
B001E75QH0|5.0|This set contains the four cinematic adventures of Indiana Jones. Raiders is a classic piece of cinema. A brilliantly directed action adventure film paying homage to adventure serials of the 30s. Temple of Doom pays similar homage, but takes Indy into horror and fantasy territory. Doom is extremely polished and lavish, personally I love it equally with Raiders. Last Crusade brings back the popular elements of Raiders, along with Sean Connery as his father. There is some brilliant dialogue in this film  and banter between them. It's probably the most family oriented of the original three. Then we have Crystal Skull, the new instalment. Personally I enjoyed it and think it is a worthy entry into the sage of Indiana Jones. There are some over the top moments, but like Temple of Doom before it, the film really pushes the fantasy elements of the action scenes. Marion Ravenwood is back and well, I won't spoil it.  It's great to see Indy back after 20 years.  Buy this set, you will watch all the films over and over again!
B001DTPZNY|2.0|There is one thing great about this movie.   The totally accurate picture of NKVD/KGB agents.  It is also fun to see that amazing piece of American brain power the DKU (Duck).   Other then that everything is forced, and ending is so over the top it hurts.    Ok so the ending all of the movies using this character have been over the top, its just that this one is out of this world.

B001C4AFP8|4.0|\\"Body of Lies\\" is a taut, riveting thriller that weaves a tale of terrorism, espionage, and betrayal amid the current landscape of violence and retribution in the Middle East. The film is based on the novel by David Ignatius.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio continues to prove that he's got the acting chops and is believable in action films. Here he plays Roger Ferris, a CIA operative working to track down a bin Ladenesque terrorist named Al-Saleem. Al-Saleem's trail leads Ferris to Jordan, where he must balance working with and between his CIA handler (played with relish by an overweight, aged Russell Crowe) and the head of Jordanian intelligence (brilliantly played by Mark Strong), who are working at crosspurposes with each other. Ferris further complicates his mission by falling for an Iranian nurse (played by Golshifteh Farahani).<br /><br />The movie uses wild technology, lies and counterlies, torture, and Ferris' growing disdain with the intelligence community. Some of the movie seems quite fanciful, and maybe it is, but except for a couple of places, it holds up as a brutually honest thriller.<br /><br />\\"Body of Lies\\" isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be. It's fiction. Some may find it unbelievable, but it's a movie, and that means it doesn't have to get everything right. It just has to entertain, and it certainly does.
B0013ND30M|5.0|For all of the thirty two years I've been on this planet, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" was one of the few Disney films that I never viewed.  My wife and daughter have watched it numerous times on VHS, but I either wasn't home at the time or I was interested in something else.  My wife considers this film to be her favorite Disney movie.  Having watched it for the first time tonight, I understand why.<br /><br />The Disney version of this fairy tale is inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet.  With the wonderful \\"Once Upon A Dream\\" waltz, a cast of likeable characters including the fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather and a classic Disney villain in Maleficent, \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is two parts love story and one part action yarn.  Humor is provided by the fathers of Aurora and Prince Philip, as well as the fairies.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, Maleficent casts a spell on the infant Aurora.  On her sixteenth birthday, she is to fall into a deadly sleep.  Luckily the kind fairy Merryweather had not yet given Aurora a gift.  In order to save her life, Merryweather casts a protective spell that prevents Aurora from passing away but puts her into a deep sleep.  This slumber can only be broken by her true love's kiss.  From there, the story has magic, a dragon, and an ending that's both beautiful and funny.<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Walt Disney's classic is a masterpiece.  The film looks beautiful.  It is set in a widescreen format and has been digitally restored to a colorful and eye-popping presentation.  The sound is also excellent and the music is simply wonderful.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with special features.  It includes an alternate opening sequence, a game in which you can learn a waltz, a look into the life of Tchaikovsky, the musical \\"Grand Canyon Suite\\" and much, much more.  Heck, even the standard Disney Channel television star music video is good.  This time around it's Emily Osment's popped-up version of \\"Once Upon A Dream.\\"<br /><br />I can honestly say that \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" has worked her way into my top ten list of Disney films.  It's a wonderful film for the whole family and deserves a spot on everybody's DVD (or Blu-ray) shelf.ing Beauty\\" has worked her way into my top ten list of Disney films.

B000EQ47GS|5.0|We ALL lost when we heard that Brad Delp decided to end his life not all that long ago. But when we want to reminisce with what I personally consider the greatest debut rock & roll record of all-time, all we need do is dust off the vinyl (or 8-track if you prefer...) and throw in this collection of absolutely incredible songs.<br /><br />I know of NO other debut record where I really LOVE each and EVERY song. This record also has the distinction of being one of the biggest selling collections in history, not to mention the biggest selling debut to boot. While their subsequent releases never quite came close to the greatness of this selection (while 'Don't Look Back' was amazingly underrated) I find myself still turning the volume knob up every single time I hear pretty much any song begin from this album.<br /><br />Being in radio, I have an interesting view of Boston having had the privilege of seeing them in concert (for free--one of THE major perks in this biz) to getting to play their songs on a regular basis for many, many years. But in all that time, never once have I become tired of hearing Brad's incredible vocals--which I honestly feel can stack up against virtually ANY singer in history--if you've seen them Live, you know what I'm talking about. Since Brad's death, the band has been in a tailspin wondering whether the band can even survive without him, and yet they have and went the same route that Journey did and recruited a new lead singer (who worked at Home Depot) off of You Tube. Whether or not he can fill Brad's shoes...? That remains to be seen, but I have high hopes full well knowing that even if this new guy is actually really good, nobody can take Brad Delp's place. NOBODY.<br /><br />In short: Boston's Self-Titled debut album is as good as you will find anywhere, and the sales alone prove that to be true--but even better, the music has stood the test of time and not only still sounds great, but has managed to even improve a little with age...or maybe is that just me?
B000002UAR|5.0|From just three years(1964-1967), The Beatles were \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", to, \\"I'd Love To Turn You On\\", Just three years and only after three years the band was at there peak and was starting to go into the full relams of psychedelia music. Such songs as \\"Love You To\\", and \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", were unheard of as \\"pop\\" songs at that time. The Beatles were taking a giant step though Revolver still has a few of there short and snippy love songs it really marked the beginning of a new era for the Beatles. Revolver is probaly one of the first mainstream albums that includes psychedelic music and was just a hint of what was too come in one years and how many great albums would come out and change music forever.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Here it is, \\"The Dark Knight\\". Christopher Nolan's epic tour de force of action, drama, and the inner workings of the human psyche. Oh, and it's a sequel to Nolan's other Batman flick, \\"Batman Begins\\" too. \\"The Dark Knight\\" picks up about 6 months or so (maybe even a year) after the events of \\"Batman Begins\\". Batman with the help of Lt. Gordon and the newly elected district attorney Harvey Dent have been cleaning up the streets of Gotham City. BUT there's a problem. There's a new guy in town and he goes by the name the Joker. As teased at the end of \\"Batman Begins\\", the Joker has come to Gotham and all hell breaks loose. The Joker's mission is simple (yet complex): to challenge the limits of Batman. Batman follows a moral code, he doesn't allow anyone's life to be at stake unless it's his and he won't kill. The Joker knows this and unless Batman reveals himself, people will die. It is here that we have the best film of 2008 and one of the best films in recent years. We finally have a Batman film that gives what we want and more: a great story, action, drama, romance, and the performances of a a life time (cough-Heath Ledger-cough). So, there's no point in me going into the whole film so let's break it down into 2 sections: the film itself and this 2-disc DVD (which I'll also provide info on the Blu Ray edition).<br /><br />THE FILM:<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Great story<br />*Emotionally filled and action packed<br />*Memorable performances from Christian Bale and Heath Ledger<br />*An amazing score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard (should have won the Oscar!!!)<br />*An overall epic film unmatched by any other film of last year<br />*Heath Ledger as the Joker<br />*An ending like no other<br />*Some truly amazing scenes and dialogue<br /><br />Cons:<br />*How can we continue the Joker if Ledger is dead?<br /><br />My Rating: 5/5, 100%, 11/10<br /><br />THE DVD REVIEW:<br /><br />Here is the 2-disc edition of \\"The Dark Knight\\". Here, you'll find the amazing movie on Disc 1 and the Special Features with Digital Copy on Disc 2. The special features are very lacking. There's only 2 behind the scenes features on here entitled \\"Uncovering Gotham: Creation of a Scene\\". One video is about the creation of the Joker's theme and the other is about the creation and design of the Batpod and the new Batsuit. All together it runs at about 24 minutes. THAT'S IT!!! Then there's 6 episodes of \\"Gotham Tonight\\" which helps bridge \\"Batman Begins\\" and \\"The Dark Knight\\" and unless you saw these online or on Comcast in the months preceding \\"The Dark Knight\\", it's not much to fun. Then there's the 3 trailers and 2 photo galleries. Oh, and there's also the 6 IMAX scenes which is kinda pointless on DVD. The Blu Ray edition features all of those and more. The \\"Creation of a Scene\\" feature is actually about 11 videos on Blu Ray and offer inside looks into the creation of many of the stunts, explosions and such. It's really cool. Also, there's two Blu Ray exclusive videos, \\"Psychology of the Dark Knight\\", which goes into the mind of Bruce Wayne and his enemies, and \\"Batman Tech\\", which goes over some of Batman's hottest gadgets as seen in \\"The Dark Knight\\". Plus, there's more galleries and tv spots plus a hidden trailer easter egg. Oh, and the IMAX scenes are integrated into the film itself so you'll notice those scenes fill your screen and look amazing!! And really, no videos about how they crafted the Joker and Two Face? No interviews? Nothing with Heath Ledger? No look at the amazing marketing campaign for the film?? Man....<br /><br />My Rating (DVD): 3/5<br />My Rating (Blu Ray): 5/5<br /><br />All in all, it's still an amazing movie. The 2-disc set doesn't justify the movie you're paying so just stick with the 1-disc. But definitely but it on Blu Ray if you have a player. It belongs in your library!!res are very lacking.

B000002UDB|5.0|The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour often is not mentioned due too the fact Sgt. Peppers came out that same year. On this album The Beatles are obviously becoming more experimental and using many more affects and trying too be more psychedelic. Well it worked on songs such as, \\"Flying\\", and \\"Blue Jay Way\\", are extremly psychedelic songs using lots of affects. This album was also the last of The Beatles making really acid rock albums and after 1967 The Beatles started too fall apart. The songs on here have all remained classics, \\"Hello Goodbye\\", \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", \\"Penny Lane\\", and \\"All You Need Is Love\\". This album is for any of those who have a taste for psychedelic music buy today and is for any Beatles fan.
B001F0ORDU|5.0|LOVED IT! Plain and simple. After all these years, I had no problem falling right back into the swing of things with the girls (Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha).

B000I2JKFG|5.0|great movie, high quality video and audio what's not to like, except for the whole HD-DVD thing not working out. Product runs great on my Xbox 360 HD-DVD player
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|[[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]] was a delightful breath of fresh air filling the sails of what one could have only hoped would be the beginning of a new era of Batman movies. Tim Burton's two films Batman and Batman Returns were very entertaining. Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever was fair at best, and Schumacher's Batman and Robin was absolutely atrocious (think the TV series).<br /><br />The Dark Knight is so head and shoulders above what Burton did that it makes the Schumacher movies look like a bad 60s TV show. The Dark Knight even outdoes Batman Begins, and that's saying a lot!<br /><br />Just as the title of Batman Begins was the best description of that movie, so is the title The Dark Knight for this one. In Batman Begins we saw exactly why and how Batman became Batman. In The Dark Knight we see a superhero with a seriously darker personality than his alter ego Bruce Wayne. And the Dark Knight must battle with some seriously dark, conflicting moral issues as well as dealing with a seriously dark villain.<br /><br />Heath Ledger will get big awards for his portrayal of The Joker...mark my words. And not because he died and to honor him. No. He'll get awards because every aspect of the role was delivered perfectly. Creepy. Genius. Crazy. Brilliant. From his vocal inflictions to that eerie way he kept licking his scars when he talked. Ledger will be sorely missed going forward.<br /><br />Both Christian Bale and Heath Ledger make you believe that Batman and The Joker are real. The rest of the cast is perfect too. All of the familiar faces are back from Batman Begins with the exception of Katie Holmes (replaced quite un-noticeably by Maggie Gyllenhaal...and I meant that as kind of a back-handed compliment).<br /><br />The special effects, cool devices and toys are back too...including an updated Tumbler (in keeping with Batman Begins, out are the stupid nicknames Batmobile, Batcycle, Batcave, Bat-etcetera).<br /><br />The Dark Knight is suspenseful, scary at times, very emotional at times and most importantly well-acted. The entire cast took their roles very serious and it made the movie that much more believable, real and...well...just awesome. This movie is a classic and I will watch it again and again on Blu Ray.ly well-acted.

B0013ND30M|5.0|\\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a magnificent adventure now in widescreen with sumptuous detail. The backgrounds have a lush intricate medieval design while the characters seem to float through each scene effortlessly. I found the movie to be especially calming and filled with luminous beauty. Each scene is exquisite, like a painting in motion. The handmade animation has been restored to a new level of brilliance. The colors are gorgeous and keep your attention even more than the storyline, which is a bit slow in places.<br /><br />The basic story revolves around three good fairies who protect princess Aurora for sixteen years. Nothing too interesting happens until Maleficent (an evil fairy) transforms herself into a dragon and then the story finally has a formidable villain, which makes it a bit more exciting. However, prince Phillip seems unable to slay Maleficent until he is helped by the three good fairies. They keep the story alive and fresh with all their magic. It is fun to watch them triumph over evil. Still, the fairies are not able to undo Maleficent's curse on the princess Aurora who falls into a deep sleep after pricking her finger on a spinning wheel's spindle created by the evil fairy. The only way she can awaken is to receive a kiss from her true love. Maleficent tries to make this an impossibility, but somehow good overcomes evil in the end.<br /><br />Since this was my first time to see Sleeping Beauty I had never realized it was a story about an arranged marriage. Fortunately princess Aurora meets prince Phillip in the forest before the wedding takes place. To me, princess Aurora looked twenty not sixteen. The only other difference from the story I heard as a child was that Princess Aurora doesn't sleep for a hundred years. Everything else was exactly as I imagined it to be. This movie has a perfection that is rare and beautiful and it is definitely a movie worth collecting.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

B000244FDW|5.0|I'm not the first one to say this: Miss Garvie's presentation of Eliza Bennet ought to be considered canonical. I've been hoping for a DVD version for years now.

However, aside from Soze having no friends, some rich people in North Carolina have legally ripped him off and Soze is too dumb to know it.----I mean the cigarettes he buys from the tobacco companies and the heart disease or cancer he probably will get.--The shareholders of Philip Morris Corp.(Altria Corp.) must have laughed their heads off if they watched this.
0765318741|4.0|I read the book because I saw the movie (as surely many others did). I have to say that I actually liked the movie more, but they are so different that it's hardly worth comparing them.<br /><br />The whole story is about what it would be like to be, basically, the last man alive. Although the conclusions it reaches are not entirely happy, the ending left me with a lot to think about in a way that the movie did not. It felt like it was political in some sense, but I'm not sure exactly what to think of it.<br /><br />Although the story is older (1950s? I think '54...) it is written in a very modern style -- and it's horror that's neither gothic nor \\"splatter.\\" I'd recommend it if only because it's not what you're expecting, and it does not end how you expect it to end.<br /><br />The best thing about this book, however, is that it is followed by a collection of short stories... actually, about half of the book is short stories. Some of the stories were better than the novel, in my opinion, although not all.
B000SQKZKG|4.0|And it was the: \\"Biggest Show on Earth\\", three musicians with more raw talent and power than anyone else of their time. I was a fan of ELP from the first album onwards. These three guys were the kings of something that would later be tagged: \\"Progressive Rock\\". To most of my friends that were into Grand Funk Railroad and Alice Cooper, the only songs by this band that they could stand were: \\"Lucky Man\\" & \\"From The Begining\\".<br />You didn't play: \\"Tarkus\\" at a party in 1972 {unless you wanted to clear the room!}<br /><br />I was one of the 350,000 freaks, that attended California Jam at The Ontario Motor Speedway in 1974. Emerson, Lake and Palmer closed that very long Show following Deep Purple to the massive stage. Everybody remembers that grand piano 25 feet over the stage doing somersaults as Keith bashed away at the keys {most of us thought that we \\"Flashed\\" that event into happening!} The computer exploded at the end of: \\"Karn Evil 9\\" and fireworks filled the skies at the end. What carried all that into the history books was that some incredible music was played that night by ELP.<br /><br />This was a three LP set, it was taken from various locations from the 1973-1974 tours of the world. Yes, \\"Hoedown\\" is played too fast and \\"Toccata\\" needs to be seen, to be believed {Carl Palmer is an Octopus!} But for me, the selection that I have listened to more times than anything else here is: \\"Piano Improvisations\\", that provides a little taste of what Keith Emerson can do on any given stage on any night of the week.<br /><br />Is this music over the top? Is this music too bombastic? Are these musicians a group of show-offs? Yes, they are guilty on all the above charges. And it was well known in the early seventies, that no other band could take a stage after them. No other band could follow this spectacle called: ELP.<br />This is the band at their pinnacle, and it is captured here on: \\"Welcome Back\\". Here is one of the greatest live albums from the 1970's.<br />Impressive to hear in 1974, and still sounds like no other in 2008.<br />Four Stars !!!nds like no other in 2008.  Four Stars !!!
1400079179|4.0|I thought my review of this work would be pretty involved given all of the hullaballoo around it, and the story. I have been under the impression that this book is some kind of very true to life story. I believe, even if it is based on a theory, it is and was never meant to be anything but a story. It is a fantastic story. I thought it was a fantastic book, very engrossing and a nice break from the real world!<br /><br />It kind of reminded me of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" or \\"The carpetbaggers\\"..... I don't know what else to say, If you LOVE picking up a book, and then raising your head three hours later to realize you have been immersed in the story for hours, then this kind of reading is for you.
0312263511|1.0|A surprisingly bad read.I thought I was going to get a detailed, engaging and POSITIVE story about the Apollo program and Apollo 17 in particular. What I did get was a trip in egocentrism, bad-mouthing and disturbingly irrational reasoning. I won't go into detail, but here is a short example of this:in a peer vote Mr. Cernan voted Rusty Schweickart, Walt Cunningham  and Buzz Aldrin as the worst---because Schweickart was an \\"irreverant intellectual\\",Aldrin liked talking about rendezvous and Cunningham because he drove  a Porsche instead of a Corvette.Huh...I won't even go into the rest, it is just more of the same bashing.Unless you are a huge fan of his or just like grandomaniacs don't waste your money on this.I've read several books on NASA and Apollo in particular--By Andrew Chaikin, Colin Burgess,Tom Wolfe, Michael Collins, Deke Slayton and Frank Borman, to name just a few.This is on the bottom of my list--- not worth getting it even as a present.
0385751532|5.0|Written as an allegory or perhaps a pseudo-fable, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is one of those rare finds that enables the reader to explore familiar territory in a new way and from a different perspective.     While we have (hopefully) all read or heard countelss Holocaust tales, this one is told from a new and indeed daring viewpoint - that of the naieve nine year old son of a Nazi Commandant, who has no idea the evils and horrors surrounding him.  In fact, he can't quite understand why the people on the \\"other side of the fence\\" get to wear striped pajamas and play with each other all day while he's confined in his new home at \\"Out-With.\\"      This is a novel for EVERYONE- I truly believe children as well as adults will gain so much from reading it, regardles of their race, religion, nationality or background.  It is short and extremely fast-paced- the average reader should be able to read it entirely within a day or two, however it will continue to haunt you and invade your thoughts for weeks on end.     While some potential readers will avoid this one perhaps because it is so hard to read about the Holocaust, I can't stress highly enough that this is a \\"MUST READ\\" and one that will have you smiling and laughing along the way- a rare reaction to a story built upon the evils of the Holocaust. Furthermore, this story is not only about the Holocaust, but applies equally to all those situations in which there are groups of people on two sides of a \\"fence\\"  - it is applicable to the current and past crises in Darfur,  genocides throughout the ages, and even those less obvious ones found in our school yards or our own neighborhoods across the county.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This was a funny and touching movie, I love the main character Lola/Simon. Everyone should see this movie.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Great movie, definitely worth the money. Finally the real batman movie, this one has met all of the standards of the comic. Excellent acting and a wonderful movie.
B000008HPE|5.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercial and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost.<br /><br />He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a much more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.<br /><br />And I'm number 12 in the que to have done this ... yawwwn.
1427200874|1.0|Sophie's World is a fine book, but this recording has a couple of mixed up tracks (tracks recorded correctly, but apparently put on the CD in reverse order) and one part where either the reader (Simon Vance) accidentally skipped a couple of paragraphs or, more likely the recording was accidentally cut.  I sent a letter to Macmillan explaining the problem.  They politely thanked me for the input; but, a year later, nothing has happened.

B001BPJJ82|5.0|If there was a style in cinematography called \\"plain air\\" - this movie would be the prototype of it. Place Matrix on one far side - this one is on the opposite far end. Despite of its dark story and sad moments it lacks the depressing claustrophobia, emphasized by the monochromatic characteristics of Matrix - which also does not seem to have a single scene outdoors.  The surrealism, colors and characters in this movie makes you look out for Salvador Dali to pop up from behind a rock.  In The Fall there is one thing you cannot find: computer graphics. Post production was about color correction and Tarsem has given his audience a strong spicy mix of an Indian color masala.      I can imagine how fun it was to shoot this movie traveling around the world from India to Argentina, Bali to Egypt. The scenery, locations, buildings alone make it worthwhile to watch this movie.   Unique cinematography which probably wont be seen any time soon again. The highest crane shots ever seen in movies and some of the wide angle optics used make you feel enormous space even if the movie is being watched on a plasma screen. Tarsem uses film for its very purpose to the extreme - visual communication so good that it almost hurts.  Apparently this film is not for the regular Spiderman fan.     Amazing transfer to blu ray.
B00139B39E|5.0|If you're new to Dream Theater, go ahead and start with this CD. But trust me, you're going to want to buy the individual albums as well. My favorite is still Images and Words.
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Top Gun was the \\"king of cool\\" in the 1980s thanks to the self-satisfied performance of Tom Cruise as hotshot \\"jock\\" pilot Peter \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell. The film revels in Mitchell's arrogant disregard for rules (he is a walking Section Eight), from his absurd guidance of a terrified comrade onto the deck of the USS Enterprise (this despite the fact Maverick's F-14 lacks the fuel to land itself) through the remarkably weak punishments he gets for breaking such rules as hitting on his DoD instructor (Kelly McGuiness) to getting his radar intercept officer \\"Goose\\" Bradshaw (ER's Anthony Edwards) killed in a thoroughly stupid contest with Tim \\"Iceman\\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer) over who will be first to \\"kill\\" the enemy plane late in the Navy's Top Gun dogfighting exercises; the film wimps out badly when, in this incident, Maverick's flying through Iceman's jetwash (thus killing his own engines and leading to the ejection punch-out where Goose slams into the cockpit canopy and severs his windpipe) is more accidental than anything; the scene should have been clearly 100% the fault of Maverick, since he practically sticks his F-14's nose into Iceman's thrusters.  But if it were thus portrayed accurately, then the film comes to an end, with Maverick grounded or even dishonorably discharged, thus underlining the weakness of playing up Maverick as incapable of discipline. Throughout the film Maverick acts in thoroughly unprofessional manner (any pilot who performed a close-in flyby on a tower would be court-martialed) and never is called on it except in the most perfunctory and insincere fashion, not even when Goose Bradshaw pleads with him early on that he, Goose, can't afford to blow the opportunity presented to him.  Cruise and McGuiness are not worth investing the time needed to watch the film; the real stars are the supporting cast - Tom Skerritt, Michael Ironside, Anthony Edwards, Val Kilmer, and Rick Rossovich - and the superb aerial dogfight footage; the use of F-5s as Soviet MiGs is a bit distracting, since the F-5s don't look at all like Soviet warplanes. Also annoying is the lack of role of the backseaters, who do more than just read radar screens in the F-14's cockpit. Kenny Loggins' famous theme song is a treat, but not really appropriate for the film.  If you can overlook the weak leads and focus on the supporting cast and the aerial footage, you're in for an entertaining dogfighting spectacle.
B000002JPA|5.0|By far my favorite Dream Theater album. It was in instant classic and it has stood the test of time. You won't regret buying this album!
B000002MUW|4.0|Bedtime Stories being Madonna's 1994 release and her 6th studio release is a very mainstream album and therefore it became immensly popular. After the controversial erotica album with its steamy lyrics and the controversy around the sex book Madonna wanted to tone down the sex factor on this album. Secret is the absolut standout track on this release. Take a bow is a really good track as well. I love the lyrics to this song. Something that is quite funny is that I did not know is that Madonna actually has two tracks with the same name in her collection, i.e., forbidden love. One time on this release and another time on the confessions album. The book-let is really nice. Madonna looks quite normal and the blonde look at the time was quite flattering indeed.
B000056JYC|3.0|I was pretty disappointed in the quality of this release. There is too much noise that should have been filtered out in the remastering. I was expecting it to be cleaned up versus the original LP. IMO, not worthy of a deluxe edition.  Having said that, the live performace is top-notch and the extra tracks are nice.
B00005AXEL|4.0|Trouble in Shangri-La being her 2001 release and her 6th solo album is a collabortion of sorts. Many of the tracks has been produced by Nicks and Sherryl Crow. Sherryl Crow is a guest artist as well and plays bass, guitar and sings background vocals. Sarah McLachlan is also a guest muisician and plays piano, guitar and sings background on the track \\"Love is\\".  Every day, Planets of the Universe, and Sorcerer are some really nice tracks on this record. The book-let is outstanding. With clear and nice photographs. Easy to read font and all the lyrics are included. 4/5.
B000OD49Q4|1.0|I should give 5 stars as this edition is nicely made, with all stuff accessoires that came with the original LP back in the sixties. Let's Russia show to the Western Record Companies how to present a CD album properly and that's the way it is. I give only 1 star as this album is offered as Japanese and many people DO BELIEVE it's Japanese because it LOOKS SO JAPANESE. The serial of this TOJP 7080-81 on obi strip is Japanese but for vinyl LPs only. The Japanese never had TOJP letters for CD editions (TOJP was only used for vinyl LPs) they do have TOCP, like the White Album Edition, real Japanese released from EMI 1998-11-23 with serial numbers TOCP-65200-01 and a complete different designed obi strip.
0800177363|3.0|Awakenings is a depressing film but an important one to watch. Directed by Penny Marshall, Awakenings is based on a true story of patients who have come out of mental illness unscathed, well temporarily of course. Robert De Niro gives the performance of a lifetime and Robin Williams proves he is more than a funny, goofy actor. Penelope Ann Miller is stunning in this film as well, very under-rated actress. Give this '90s tearjerker a viewing, enjoy!
0385339089|4.0|I must say this is the third book I read from Grisham. It really is a page turner and you really want to know what's next.<br />The thing I like the most about Grisham's wrtting is the way he describes feelings.... the way he describes the situations.<br />Mark is just a geniuos and there is no way you would not love him... He's smart and funny, and he is the typical boy who has seen way too much TV....<br />Reggie... well, she is just the kind lawyer and the one who feels most like Mark's mom.<br />Honestly, I read the book like in 4 days... I just couldn't put it away... However I didn't like the end, I think that somehow he was tired of writting and at the end everything happens so fast.<br />Anyway, you will enjoy this book.....
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies DC comics has ever released or possibly any movie ever released. Not only is it fantastic acting by all the best there is, but it is bewildering and sadistic and makes you want to see more and more. A more dark and disturbing film that is exactly the way it should be. It's not a movie ment for the little kids and toddlers, which the parents always assumed it was for. It is Batman, not Barney, wait a few more years before buying for your 4 year old. Get it for yourself!!!!!!!
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Wow!  I cannot wait for this DVD.  I'm not going to go into the plot details.  I just want to say that this was the most entertaining movie I saw this year.  Mind you, The Dark Knight was a good epic film... one of the best.  Iron Man was a good super hero adventure film.  Hellboy II was in a world of it's own.  It had humor, adventure, sci-fi, and a dash of romance all rolled up in this one film.  It had a good mix of the original Hellboy and Pans Labrynth.  As a comic book fan, I enjoyed the first Hellboy... didnt love it, but enjoyed it.  Hellboy II takes it too a whole new level.  But hey, mabe it was so good to me becuase my expectations were low... Nah.  Again, I am one of those corny extreme Batman fans so I'm looking forward to watching the Dark Knight again and just adding it to my collection, but Hellboy II is going to be one of those DVD's I'm going to want to watch again and again with friends.  Del Toro always does a good job on his special features, so I'm not worried about that.  You have'nt seen this yet, just buy it... dont rent it.  It is worth it.
B00005JPO1|1.0|I saw this when it hit the theaters. I was disappointed beyond belief. I was hoping that despite the mediocre trailers that there would be something redeeming about this movie, but there wasn't. This was basically Spielberg and Lucas ruining one of the best film franchises out there. Personally, I'm just gonna try and forget that I ever saw this movie and imagine a better set of adventures for a movie hero that deserved better than this.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Many reviews here describe why this movie is just that and I won't dwell on those aspects of the movie.  I will say this though.<br /><br />This is my absolute favorite of the Disney classics.  The art direction is simply superb, many scenes present themselves as multi-layered moving story books.  It not only is an interesting direction, but is entirely complimentary to the midieval fairy tale setting of the movie.<br /><br />The story is wonderfully and efficiently written, and includes Disney's most memorable villian.  This movie truly is a stylistic classic, a giant among it's peers.<br /><br />Per this blu-ray speicfically, this movie looks like it could have been produced yesterday.  The absolute crispness of the backgrounds, especially forgrounds during closeups is stunning.  I will say I did notice some softness of character in mid-ground shots, but what could you expect of a movie of this vintage.  Even the live action shots of the story book opening is extrodinarily detailed.<br /><br />And it sounds great, 7.1 surround sound in hi-def DTS-HD MA audio.  For a movie that was originally recorded in hi-tech (at the time) stereophonic sound, the surround effects and \\"presence\\" and superb.  Another masterful job by Disney.<br /><br />Bonus features:<br />This 2 disc set includes an exhaustive set of bonus features, in line with high profile Disney releases.  These include, numerous making of and historical bits, the standard interactive game and next-gen features such as BD-live and Picture-in-Picture \\"Cine-explore\\". Additionally included is a limited time pack-in of a standard DVD disc.  Personally, I find the BD-live features are of limited value but many might find the opportunity to send piture mail to friends over the Disney BD-live system fun.  I do think the limited time DVD pack-in is a great bonus for those that have portable regular DVD players such as in-car models.  Why buy 2 discs if you have kids and are interested in making sure your movie purchases work with mobile needs.<br /><br />All, in all, this edition including the extensive bonus features make this movie a nobrainer as a first purchase or an upgrade from VHS and a highly recommend for people upgrading from DVD.ile needs.    All, in all, this edition including the extensive bonus features make this movie a nobrainer as a first purchase or an upgrade from VHS and a highly recommend for people upgrading from DVD.
B00051E906|1.0|The directions are very poorly done...very difficult to relate to the operation of the unit. I purchased some calibrated uranium ore to test this gadget with and found the results to be totally unreliable and very inconsistent. I ended up returning it to the vendor and purchasing their next level up unit called the 'Monitor 4' which performs GREAT (it was also almost double the cash, but I guess you get what you pay for). The vendor was a pleasure to deal with.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|What else can be said about this film? It's a classic amongst classics. I'm not usually a fan of colorization, but the studio did a great job with this film. It looks like it was shot in color. I highly recommend that everyone rent it or buy it.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Simple Summary. If you bought a car and it was a lemon you could take it back for a refund. A shame you can't really do that for bad movies as well. It instantly reminds me of movies like Blair Witch. If I'd known it was filmed to pretend it was real, I would have never bought it. I watched about 30 minutes of it before its weak plot and \\"artistic\\" shooting style was just to much. Unless you like this type of movie, don't was your money.
B000000WJ2|4.0|The songs on this album are top notch.  I'm only nitpicking the production. I think it's too smooth around the edges. Don't get me wrong, it's MAGIC on \\"Hate it When You Leave\\", but I keep wondering...  What if this album had been produced by Joe Henry? Or Jack White? Or Tom Waits? (sigh)  I try not to think about it.  Get the album.
B0016NF06O|4.0|I know what you're thinking? Willie Nelson and Wynton Marsalis? Together? I thought the same thing, too, when I saw them on The Tonight Show earlier this year. I mean, we are talking about Willie Nelson, the Texas troubadour who will duet with, well, just about anyone who asks. And then there's Wynton Marsalis, the jazz purist--puritan?--who disdained even his brother, Branford, for touring with Sting back in the 1980s. How in the world did these two get together?    That's something I haven't discovered yet, even in the nice little behind-the-scenes video up on YouTube. Upon closer inspection, the pairing is not as far from left field as you might think. Nelson has covered everything including reggae (yeah, really) but one of his biggest albums was Stardust (1978), an album of standards from the Great American Songbook, that helped to define what Nelson does best: blend many varied genres and elements to create something different, if not original. Marsalis, in the meantime, has spent the bulk of his twenty-five year career bringing back the prominence of acoustic jazz, the jazz before Miles Davis \\"corrupted\\" the genre by plugging in and going electric. And Marsalis succeeded, reminding folks (and record executives) that traditional jazz can be good and make money at the same time. The songs Marsalis used to usher in the Young Lions movement in jazz were those from The Great American Songbook.    Beyond the two men drinking from the same well of music, look at their backgrounds. They are both southerners, Nelson from Texas and Marsalis from New Orleans. Southern music is a smorgasbord of sounds and influences. Gospel, blues, jazz, bluegrass, folk, country, Texas swing, and more all can be found in almost any song by a southerner. So it was, two southerners and their band members went up to New York and recorded a concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center.    \\"Two Men and the Blues\\" is a live recording. It serves the music well because, I think, the perfection of a studio would have lessened the impact and spontaneity of the performance. You get the sense that these seven men are not on a stage at a prestigious concert hall but in the drummer's garage. It's a Saturday night, it's hot, the door's open, the beer getting warm in the ice chest full of melting ice, and these guys are just jammin' for no other reason that they love music.    \\"Bright Lights Big City\\" kicks off the set. Wynton's band--he brought himself on trumpet, Walter Blanding (sax), Carlos Henriquez (bass), Dan Nimmer (piano), and Ali Jackson (drums)--sets up the nice lilting shuffle feel. Mickey Raphael's harmonica is also there, adding that certain flourish that only a harmonica can. All the instrumentalists take a turn at soloing, even Nelson on guitar. You know going into this recording that Wynton's band is top notch. If there was going to be a weak link, it was going to be Nelson's guitar playing. I was interested in hearing if Nelson took a turn on soloing. He did, and, while it's not superb, this is the type of song where fancy pyrotechnics are out of place. So Nelson did just fine.    The longer you listen to this recording, you realize how close the phrasing of Nelson's vocals and his guitar really are. His Martin nylon string guitar does not hold the sustain like a steel-string guitar. Nelson usually compensates by repeatedly striking whichever string he's playing. But on this recording, he doesn't do that a lot. He lets the struck string fade when it wants to, much like his voice. Nelson is not a singer who can hold a note for a long period of time. Where a singer like, say, Sinatra, would carry his phrasing past the four-measure break, Nelson breaks his vocal phrasing short. As a result, there are usually more silences in a Nelson tune. That's his style and it really works in this set.    \\"Night Life\\" is one of those tracks where you imagine it being played in a late-night jazz club, after midnight but before closing time, the smoke hanging low from the ceiling, all but the die-hard have gone home. It's the time of night for the faithful, the friends, and for the girls in the audience who want to date a jazz performer. Wynton's trumpet shines here, opening the track with a long solo that sets the down tempo mood. But it's his flutter sound during the chorus that really takes the roof off. Out of nowhere, it blasts above Nelson's vocals. And Willie brings out a better solo on guitar, a nice, soft theme that put my worries about his abilities to rest. He also played a good melody on \\"Basin Street Blues.\\"    Since Stardust is still one of Nelson's most famous records, you knew the band was going to cover some of those songs. They do the title track and, of course, \\"Georgia, On My Mind.\\" \\"Stardust\\" has a beautiful, lush tenor sax solo, the kind where you can hear the air passing over the reed in the lower register, a nuance that, for me, a sax player, I love. \\"Georgia\\" starts off showcasing Nelson's vocals as the centerpiece but the soloist shine just as brightly. Marsalis's wah-wah trumpet wails, Raphael's harmonica sings, and Nimmer's piano playing bring a new, but slower, energy to this song. If I had to pick a definitive version of this song as sung by Nelson, it would be this one.    When you listen to the record, it's at this point where the audience and the band start to let loose. From the band side, this is the first tune where you can hear Nelson compliment his fellow players during the song. From the audience, they knew the song as it began and they cheered audibly at its conclusion. I could say the audience was polite but tepid in their applause at the beginning of the set. Perhaps they, like new listeners, don't know what to make of this seemingly strange pairing. By the end of \\"Georgia,\\" they knew they were a part of something special. And they let the band know it. For the rest of the set, you can hear cat calls from the audience as they get into the spirit of the night.    An old Hank Williams tune, \\"My Bucket's Got a Hole In It,\\" has the vibe of the New Orleans Preservation Jazz Band, complete with a squeaky clarinet and a drum solo, greeted with whistles and cheers of the audience. They cheer Nelson's best guitar solo in Cole Porter's \\"Ain't Nobody's Business. \\" They laugh as Wynton brings his only vocal performance on this song, telling Nelson and the audience all the things he might do that are, you guessed it, nobody's business. The set closes with \\"That's All,\\" a fast blues shuffle where everybody has their last chance to shine. Amid the audience clapping along (wonder if they were standing?), you get a taste of the power of Wynton's trumpet as he let's loose with one of his famous long notes, high and a little dirty.    By the end, the band and the audience have relaxed and just let the night sweep them away. And we as listeners can get a taste of what it was like those two nights at Lincoln Center. When performances like this crop up, my immediate impulse is to want more of it. Sometimes, the sequel does not live up to the promise of the original. In this case, however, another CD would be more than welcome. And I'd love to see the band perform down in Austin at the South by Southwest or Austin City Limits festival.    I love it when two musicians realize that there are more things that unite them than differences in their approaches to music. It reminds you that music is universal and can bring just about anyone together. And, if the results of unique pairings are like that of this CD--where you can't help but smile and tap your foot--it really is lightening in a bottle. (excerpted from [...]
0240810554|5.0|This book is THE most essential piece of darkroom equipment. Before you buy your enlarger or sink, get this book. Not only does it contain evey formula you'll ever need, it has tips from contributing authors,conversion tables and much more. Steve Anchell has done a superb job organizing all this into a readable, easy to understand book. I give it my highest recommendation.

B00192KCQ0|5.0|After the detour that was St. Anger, Metallica are back in top form with a very ballsy album in the form of Death Magnetic. Much better.. and thrashier than anything after Justice, Metallica have also seemed to have found a better 'groove'... like tracks such as the first 3 tracks. They're all sounding good. James' voice is a little toned down compared to previously... guess its the age thing. Although there's only tracks... the album clocks in at almost 80 mins. The first 4 tracks - 'Just your life, End of the line, Broken and Day that never comes' are relentless... thrashy, groovy typical 80's Metallica. Only Unfogiven III was a disappointment... other than that the whole album is amazing. Cyanide, Apocalypse are excellent. This album is Metallica being Metallica again.
0142407542|4.0|This story, while good, lacks that certain something that \\"The Gruffalo\\" has.  However, it is still and entertaining read and my 4 year-old faux-niece loves it.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|There is NO WAY, that this film gets a cumulative 4/5. The ratings have been pulled over from the SD. Amazon, please consider adding a separate database field for PQ and AQ for the hi-def products.<br /><br />This movie itself for me is a 5. I love it! The transfer- a nightmare. Tons of noise, color flutuation and light changes/artifacting. The picture is soft, too.<br /><br />Fox/MGM were just (10/2008) given some of the worst ratings, for their Blu-Ray releases and I understand why. I am a huge fan of this franchise, and was incredibly excited to see this in hi-def. If 0 stars was an option, I'd give it a 0. This Blu-Ray transfer is among some of the worst that I have seen.<br /><br />For the premium price paid for Blu-Ray I expect a pristine picture and sound. Fox/MGM I hope you're listening. This truly is shameful!<br /><br />I am thoroughly disappointed and all of the future MGM/Fox titles will be considered \\"rentals\\" until I see an review.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I absolutely loved this show when it was still on air, but was unable to get the chance to watch it most weeks. THis box set was definitely not a disappointment. I cannot wait to buy the second season!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I seriously believe this is the best album (especially MCR album) I have ever heard. Yes I am one of those punk kids who dies their hair and wears black, but I was doing all of that long, long before I heard any of MCR's music. I believe their music is really inspirational and sung well. I also do like groups like the Sex Pistols, but I think MCR is way better.
0803730470|5.0|This is seriously one of the best children's books out there.

I will read anything she asks, but this is one book that I ask to read to her.<br /><br />The book is good for kids of all ages.  The story is fun to hear and can have a deeper meaning when the kid is mentally ready.

B00000K3CM|1.0|This film is not as good as the first one. It is kind of cute, but overall boring, predictable. I agree with the other people who gave this film 1 star, this film is not suitable for kids (not that adults deserve to watch such a bad film).
B000002NZO|4.0|Great remix of an old classic.  A must have for any Genesis fan !
B001CIPU3G|5.0|I got into Trivium shortly after their acsendancy album hit through a friend and i havnt looked back since. I've observed their evolution from Ember to Inferno all the way up to their now newly released album Shogun and they are in my honest opinion exactly where they need to be. This album has all your thrash metal needs from the machine gun guitar riffs to your entricate solos. And some of the songs even have a few catchy hooks. The biggest thing for me though is that Matt has finally found a happy medium between his screams and his singing, and that i think is the most important aspect of this album. If Trivium keeps putting out more albums like this one then they have a long long road of success ahead of them.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Whether you like old school or the radio friendly versions of Metallica, it was all **their** music. I won't over-analyze song by song; I'll just say this CD is a good mix of their musical tastes throughout. It has catchy melodies, and plenty of power metal. If they just needed money, a $100 a seat tour would have done it. Death Magnetic is instead a good expression of where they're at and what their (years deep)roots are. The songs have good leads and are way too long to be purely radio friendly. And if they (or the record co...) do shorten songs like The Day That Never Comes to be more radio friendly(ok, an overused term like \\"change\\" or \\"maverick\\"), all the more reason to buy the CD and hear the whole thing the way Metallica fans will appreciate.
0307383415|1.0|This is typical shameless garbage that the criminal elite use to promote themselves and their underlings. And don't be ridiculous and think that slick BHO even wrote this book. None of our phoney, criminal, deviant, controlled \\"leaders\\" ever write any of the shameless books that are attributed to them. Why do we continue to be so naive and foolish? Why do we continue to think that we live in any sort of democracy?  What can be said for sure about BHO is that he is an attractive man who can spew forth what is written for him in an eloquent manner. Oh, and he has nice white teeth. That's it folks, and I could care less what Oprah and all those little Hollywood turds gush about him, because BHO is a manufactured cut-out of a candidate who will be completely controlled by all the usual suspects. But, don't think just anyone could do what BHO does. He has a small army of helpers creating his image, dressing him, booking teeth whitening appointments, and white washing his past - especially on the internet. He has obviously had quite a bit of training in public speaking, but not just the \\"normal\\" type that you and I might sign up for. No, no. What he's been well trained in (as was Clinton, Reagan, and many others) is neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and subtle hypnotic/subliminal speech patterns. Of course it also helps a great deal that everywhere he speaks is \\"specially wired\\" for sound, which affects the audience in ways they probably couldn't comprehend or believe. This type of frequency manipulation of brain waves and body rhythms has been perfected for well over 2 decades. But, that's getting off topic...  Anyways, the amount of misdirection, inconsistency, undocumented statements / claims, and total shameless introspective pyscho mish-mash in this book is gut wrenching (in a bad way). But for a sane person searching for the truth, here are some questions to ponder: where was his father born in reality? how many wives / offspring did he have? as a \\"poor goat farming\\" family, how did he get the expensive initial education that he did? what are the connections to the Ford Foundation and the Rockefellers? where was BHO's mother born and why is there no records for the first 10 years of her life? if she was schooled in Lebanon initially, why? why can't the BHO Team produce a birth certificate from the State of Hawaii if he was born there? why did the BHO Team finally release a \\"document of live birth\\" that was shown to be a forgery? where was BHO born then? why was BHO's \\"maternal grandfather\\" working for the Rockefellers? why is there essentially no evidence that BHO went to Columbia University and why does he refuse to release transcripts in order to prove it? what is the connection of Indonesia to BHO really? And these are just a few questions a great researcher by the name of Don Nicoloff brings up in his writings for the Idaho Observer.  Here's my personal take: BHO is part of an elite group of underlings with Rockefeller connections whom the real Controllers choose from to do their biddings. His real family tree has been obscured, as has his early childhood, and his \\"resume\\" has been grossly fluffed up to say the least, but these are common themes within the group of elite underlings. Two general statements that can be said about all elite underlings (and they apply to BHO of course) are they have connections - Rockefeller at least, but also Israel, and they have a variety of \\"hooks\\" in them. \\"Hooks\\" are things that create shame and fear and allow for blackmail, control, and sometimes extortion. All elite underlings have similar \\"hooks\\", and these are sexual deviance (homosexuality and usually pedophilia), hard core drug use, criminal financial activity, and (believe it or not) some sort of connection to Satanic / esoteric / occult rituals and rites. Now, having said that, BHO could have been chosen to be some CEO, or Congressman, or Supreme Court Judge, or high level military man, or International banker, or Ambassador, oreven major Hollywood player by the Controllers, but obviously it was decided (probably due to his skin color, good looks, and ability to master those special public speaking protocols) that he could take a run at the Presidency. Then among the Controllers, Brzezinski obviously won the rights to be BHO's puppet handler and direct him in agendas only the criminal elite can fathom. But, don't think that McCain doesn't have his connections, hooks, and handler also, because he has. This is the System that actually exists, but the sheeple dream of democracy and read books like this because they want to have hope, believe in ideals, and delay dealing with reality. In this sense, the book is brilliantly titled in an ironic, double meaning sort of way.
B0001MDP3G|1.0|This movie was not that good. In the first place, it was excessively voilent. I know this movie takes place during the civil war and it was a voilent time, but I find it particulary unbearable because of several scenes. I also was disgusted by the sexual suggestions and scenes. I couldn't even sit through it, it was so bad.<br />  It might have had a good love story, I mean a man forsaking his soldier days and risking his own life by being a deserter to return to the love of his life, that basis was fine. I'm a Civil War romance lover, I don't mind that. However, all the junk crammed in this film made it immpossible to watch.

6301247485|4.0|Perhaps some classics cannot be made into movies. THE GREAT GATSBY, which makes anybody's list of the great American novels, may just be one. Having just seen this film again for the first time since its release, I think I need to reread the novel. The chief flaw of the movie is the casting of Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan. While she certainly can act and become hysterical at the smell of a room full of roses, it is difficult to understand the power that she holds on Gatsby. While Redford makes an adequate if not outstanding Gatsby, Sam Waterston, a very fine actor indeed, is perfectly cast as Gatsby's neighbor. Bruce Dern works as the boorish Tom Buchanan, Karen Black isn't bad as his woman on the side, and Scott Wilson as her cuckolded husband who seeks revenge is well cast.<br /><br />The music by Nelson Riddle, who won an Oscar for his efforts, is really quite wonderful. And the wardrobe department must have gone over its budget. As Buchanan snidely remarks at one point, Gatsby wears pink suits.<br /><br />While the movie get better towards the end, for much of over its two hours it moves far too slowly. Some of the photography should have been edited out. I refer to one scene in particular where we see a closeup of Gatsy and Daisy in an upside down reflection in an aquarium as they kiss while gold fish swim through them. Ugh.<br /><br />As I watched this terribly static film, I keep thinking how much better it could have been if it had been a Marchant Ivory production. It probably deserves a C but I'd give it a B-.
0739368044|5.0|As with the other 2 books in this cycle it is a journey of growth and self realization. This book expands on some of the promises and commitments made by Eragon as well as other characters to the greater good of one's self, love, kin, and country. It lets you believe in the worthiness of the struggles to fight evil. Great contination it just ends a bit abrupt.
1593083246|4.0|I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, with the exception of two things.<br /><br />First, the version that I read has a nauseating, fan-boy introduction. I don't particularly care which version of this book you purchase; you should skip the introduction. Just in case. This is not the fault of the author, but of the editor, and I will not ding the author because of its presentation - especially hundreds of years after her death. It would be dirty pool.<br /><br />Second, there is a single passage in the novel which details Elizabeth's growth as a character, where she, introspectively, weighs in on how she feels she has developed. This was out of character for her. She spends much of the novel in angst about various things (such as Mr. Bingley's interactions with her sister Jane, Mr. Darcy's feelings for her, and vacillating between like and dislike for Mr. Darcy himself). The loss of this paragraph would have, in no way, mutilated the perception of Elizabeth as a cogent and erudite character with a mind of her own that was well-working. Nor would its absence have colored an intelligent reader's perception of her growth.<br /><br />Mr. Bennet, however, was hilarious. His steadfast perception of all of the women around him (excepting Elizabeth) as being irredeemably foolish was, I think, a major highlight of the book. Not because it was accurate (although it certainly was in the case of the youngest daughter, Lydia), but because it highlights and gently satirizes the perception of ladies at this time in England. This is made particularly clear in the case of his wife, who is the most grasping fictional woman since Becky Sharp. The juxtaposition of Mr. Bennet's foolish perceptions of women (as themselves being foolish), and the intelligence of two of his daughters (Jane and Elizabeth) faithfully, I believe, points out one of the main purposes of Ms. Austen's writing: To throw into stark contrast the difference between the commonly, culturally accepted perceptions of women (e.g., Mr. Bennet) and the reality of their perceptions and their intelligence (e.g., the two eldest Bennet sisters). This was, in my perception, one of the most important purposes of Ms. Austen's writing, and she performed it well.<br /><br />The interactions between Elizabeth and several of the other characters, especially Lady Catherine De Bourgh, are often times hilarious. Other times, such as her frequent misperceptions of Mr. Darcy and her excercise of her sometimes rapier wit at his expense, are less amusing than they are painful; not because of their inaccuracy or their sharpness, but more because an astute reader will realize the reality of Mr. Darcy's character much earlier than Elizabeth does. And once that point is reached, and even before, it is hard to take her chidings with equanimity. Even if he is a jerk, he is still a human being, and it seems malicious of Elizabeth to treat him this way. Unlike some, I will not excuse her behavior as common for the times, because Elizabeth seems...transcendent of her times in some ways, much like the author herself.<br /><br />This was, by and large, a very entertaining book. It is well worth reading, whether you are curious about the foundations of romantic comedy (which got their first big push in the public here), in the time period of the Napoleonic War (which doesn't figure in the novel, but the social interactions of the time are well detailed), a fan of novels of manners (such as this one, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma, by the same author, Thackeray's Vanity Fair, or Evelyn Waugh's A Handful of Dust), or just in the mood for a fun book. If I could, I would give it 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A<br /><br />Harkius

Very disappointed.

B0017R5UAA|2.0|This is really such a shimmeringly beautiful, almost elegiac, album. But, honestly, in times such as this (specifically, now (for those of you who may be reading this a few years from now)), we need help with our economy any way we can get it. Now, I know music can only do so much (especially since it's just music), but I feel like we need to support the music artists that most help boost our countrie's economic station even if the differences between artists in this regard is very very slight. We need all the help we can get!    Well, Fleet Fox (or is it Foxes? I'm not sure which), as you notice, create very laid back folky music. I feel like this runs the risk of influencing a certain laid backness that our country really can't weather right now. I feel like New Order or someone like daft Punk who use technology in their music and have to take classes to learn their instruments and have to have software and flow charts and such things to do their music are therefore more like to influence a swelling economy.    Fleet F's are on Sub-Pop. This is the label Nirvana(s) started on. Their lead vocalist, Kurt Cobain, killed himself. If you think about it, killing oneself is like committing economic suicide. Sure, you're not spending any more money, but you're not bringing in any either to yourself. That kind of philosophy that Sub-Pop upholds can't be spread through our fragile nation right now. Again, there are other artists like Jay-Z or Usher etc. who aren't on Sub-Pop and not doing that stuff.    They also have a song \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\" that someone could get the idea that tigers and peasants... Well, anyway, you get the idea. It's frightening to even think about it, even as unlikely as it is to happen. The fact that it COULD happen is enough to stay away from this album.     But if you really, really can't stay away from this album, do it in such a way that the economy doesn't \\"know\\" if that makes any sense.    FYI Modest Mouse is probably statistically about the best (if any music can really be called the best) for this particular sub-prime crash/over-leveraged credit lethal combination our nation's going through right now.    OKAY: I'VE GOTTEN A 0 of 8 HELPFUL ON THIS SO FAR? YOU KIDDING ME? I PUT IN THE TIME TO REVIEW THIS FOR YOU? AND DO YOU NOT CARE ABOUT THE ECONOMY?      OKAY II: THIS REVIEW ONLY HAS 8 OF 54 HELPFUL RATING!!? WHAT? I DON'T DO THESE REVIEWS FOR MY HEALTH. I LISTEN TO THE MUSIC, I DO RESEARCH, AND I TAKE THE TIME TO DO THESE FOR YOU GUYS. WELL, I SURE HOPE YOU DON'T GIVE OBAMA AN 8 FOR 54 HELPFUL ON ELECTION DAY. IF YOU DO, HE'LL LOSE THE ELECTION AND THE PRESIDENCY RIGHT ALONG WITH IT.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|As my brother said, this is Star Trek should have been.  It's funny, but it also has more layers than that and the characters have various strengths and weaknesses.  You know, like real people.  Not like the cardboard cutouts in most TV series, who each have one defining characteristic.      The only flaw is the Inara character, who is a \\"Companion,\\" the polite name for a unionized hooker.  Sometimes this is used to advance the plot, but there are a number of sex scenes (fairly explicit for prime time TV) which serve no purpose except to fill time.  So you might want to put the little ones to bed as you enjoy this fine series.

I really like the point of view and how he just explains things as if you were just chatting with him (As he meant this book to be and says so in the beginning).  It's a very easy read and quick reference.
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|Most standard dvd players nowadays have a feature that lets you upscale a standard dvd to 1080p. So you can enjoy your old dvds in maximum resolution on a high definition television. You can find the standard dvd versions of these 3 movies, and buy them for about $40 grand total. So you would be paying an additional $40 to own this blue-ray set. It's NOT worth it!!!

0143038583|5.0|Pollan is an extraordinary writer: here he takes a subject that could easily be dry as dirt and turns it into a completely absorbing, thought-provoking tour de force. Though very occasionally overwritten, this book is never boring. It will teach every reader to think twice about both the source and the true cost of the food they eat. Recommended reading for absolutely everyone; even more particularly for anyone with a real interest in food or simply in developing their social conscience.
B001CD6FKS|3.0|No where on this page does is say that the second disc is a pretty boring DVD game. Nowhere else on here does it say the digital copy disc is only compatible with PCs.<br /><br />Luckily, the actual Blu-Ray disc IS multi-regional. I live here in Australia and the disc works fine, just finished watching it. It's a beautiful film in high-definition and completely mind-boggling.<br /><br />I'm not going to bore you with what I think the film is about or is like, but the Blu-Ray is a bit of a bummer. 3 stars for the whole shebang, but I rate the film four stars.

0380730405|4.0|It's been called a mystery, a romance, a Gothic novel, been labeled the best novel of the century, criticized as intensely boring and slow, praised as a real page turner.  To some degree it all seems correct, all of those elements being presented by Dame du Maurier in her famous novel.<br /><br />But I say that the only thing that kept me going through the first half of Rebecca was that famous opening line:  Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.  Simply wondering why she was no longer at Manderley, what drove and kept her away, was enough motivation to get through some very, very slow and tedious narrative.<br /><br />I'm all for good descriptions of settings and character development, and in this book the estate Manderley is both of those, the setting and a crucial character.  But in literature there's a spectrum of development, from inadequate to just the right amount and on to excessive - development overkill, if you will.  Rebecca suffered, I think, some level of development overkill, and the details, excessive as they were, almost killed the story for me.  I thought I was in trouble by page 10 when I could barely concentrate enough through the very detailed descriptions of the Manderley countryside and such things.  Descriptions of the plants and the grounds and the woods and the animals, etc., etc.  And those same descriptions had a very frequent (and unneeded) reoccurence.  In short, many portions seemed overwritten and too detailed to the point of distracting from the story.<br /><br />But I read on.  By page 50 I was wondering when something would happen, a break in the story to motivate the reader with some intrigue.  Nothing.  Page 100, still nothing to grip me.  Fifty more pages, nada.  On to page 200, and by now I've been slowly, very slowly, plodding my way through this story for a month.  There was still nothing to compel me to turn pages; thus the book sat unread for many days at a time.  There was a conversation around page 130 that I thought might lead to some excitement, but then nothing.  Though one success by this point in the story, it's been made painfully clear to the reader that the unnamed Mrs. de Winter the Second is diffident, shy and weak, and that she lives in the shadow of and is haunted by the memory of the dead Rebecca.  In fact, I think the diffidence of the young Mrs. de Winter is one area where Dame Du Maurier succeeded in her excessive character development; the young wife easily brings disrespect on herself by the reader because of her lack of self-worth and confidence.<br /><br />Finally, at about page 220, finally the story broke open.  Finally I had reached a point that compelled me to keep reading.  Finally, a story that moved quickly and was really a very, very good and well written climax.  It became a five-star story from that point on, having elevated itself from a tedious, boring two stars.<br /><br />I also really liked the epilogue, the addition made by Dame Du Maurier later.  Thought it brought the story around to a good conclusion for the reader.  So in the end, while I think the overall writing was too detailed and to some degree overwritten, I did find entertainment in the story's culmination.ht might lead to some excitement, but then nothing.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Well, I had a feeling I would be saying this when July 18, 2008 rolled around, and here goes. The Dark Knight is the best film of the year (so far), with some impressive acting from everyone, a top notch screenplay, a great musical score and a little someone called Heath Ledger. Make that a BIG someone. His Joker performance has been praised by critics and fans over and over again by now, and he deserves every bit of the constant accolades. His presence dominates the whole film. The first time you see movie, you really have no idea when he is going to pop up and bring his bag of crazy chaos. This is stuff of legends folks.<br /><br />Christian Bale is in full gloom mode here, but he pulls it off as only an actor of his calibur could. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a better actress than Katie Holmes, so that was a good trade-off. She did get on my nerves at times, and I hate to say it, but it is hard to believe all these men would want her. I thought Aaron Eckhart made a very good Harvey Dent and Two-Face. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are all amazing actors and elevate the supporting roles they are given.<br /><br />Kudos to the limited use of CGI and attention to detail from director, Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />The Dark Knight will remind you of the epic crime drama Heat at times, but it doesn't lose the crowd pleasing action of a comic book film. Just wait until you see The Joker's disappearing pencil trick. Maybe I'm a little twisted, but it brought a huge smile to my face.<br /><br />The Blu-ray and DVD release will likely break all sales records and I already have mine pre-ordered. I usually rent most Blu-rays, but The Dark Knight and Iron Man are must buys.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|(This is a review of the film, not the DVD and its specific features)<br /><br />The first thing one should know about The Dark Knight is that it is not, by any stretch, a children's movie. Director Christopher Nolan has made another Batman film for adults, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />What Nolan has done, with two deft strokes of his cinematic brush, is take the first four Batman films ('Batman', 'Batman Returns', 'Batman Forever', and 'Batman & Robin'), and rendered them all amateurish and unwatchable. The current series ('Batman Begins', and now 'The Dark Knight') are not so much comic book movies as they are crime dramas, cut from the same cloth as Michael Mann's best work in films such as Heat and Collateral (both personal favorites of mine).<br /><br />The core cast from Batman Begins remains intact, with the exception of Maggie Gyllenhal, replacing the horribly miscast Katie Holmes as assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart is added as district attorney Harvey Dent, who bring a John F. Kennedy-esque quality to the part.<br /><br />It is a fair statement to make that Heath Ledger's performance as Batman's arch-enemy, The Joker, has not been overhyped. Ledger deserves every accolade and ounce of praise he has received for this role. He will, in time, be on every \\"Greatest Movie Villain\\" list, and has rendered Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the same character to be both buffoonish and irrelevant. Nicholson's Joker was cartoonish, where Ledger's was psychotic and frightening. Early on during the movie, the viewer forgets that he is watching an actor, and gets drawn into the nightmarish persona that only Batman is equipped to confront.<br /><br />Tim Burton's first Batman film suffered from a lack of confrontations between Batman and The Joker. This movie did not make that same mistake, as The Joker's cat-and-mouse game -- a game he seems to be playing not only with the Guardian of Gotham, but the entire world -- unfolds over the course of the film.<br /><br />The story is airtight, and the acting is top-notch. My biggest beef with the film is that Bale's voice, as Batman, is extremely exaggerated. That was a surprising faux pas, as Nolan seemed to take small details such as that into account for 'Begins'. It is not, however, a dealbreaker for this movie.<br /><br />This is a very intense film, and certainly not meant for children. There are several white-knuckle moments throughout the movie, and I could count at least four points where I thought the movie had reached its end. It clocks in at about 2 1/2 hours, but they roll by quickly and in a satisfying manner.<br /><br />It is not essential that one sees Batman Begins prior to seeing this movie, but there are small references throughout this movie to the first (for example, you might wonder why there is no Batcave if you see this without seeing 'Begins'). None, however, that would prevent the viewer from enjoying the movie, or cause them to feel lost. Give this one a ten out of ten, or two thumbs up, or five stars. Whatever your rating system is, this movie will become the measuring stick for comic book movies going forward. When you see this movie, make sure you go to the bathroom prior to its beginning, as you will not want to leave your seat.is top-notch.

B000EMGJM2|3.0|Van Hunt sophomore CD finds him expanding his range and influences, and not just giving us a rehash of his excellent debut CD [[ASIN:B0001BKAGM Van Hunt]]. And for that he has to be admired, as an artist that will develop his sound between CDs. I have to be honest and say that the rockier moments on here left me quite cold, but remind me of Prince & Lenny Kravitz.  But there are moments on here that do hit the heights. 'Being a Girl', 'Character', 'Priest or Police' and the gorgeous (and my favorite song on the CD) Hole In my heart. The thing I love about both CDs (and I hope he continues with throughout his career) are his excellent, melancholy, abstract lyrics that are best exemplified on 'Priest & Police'. As I write Van Hunt is labeless, and thus is third Cd [[ASIN:B000YMEKP0 Selections From The Album Popular]] as a complete CD, is gathering dust awaiting release. Which is a crying shame, and a sad indictment on the music industry as we know it. Until such time as this is rectified, at least we can enjoy this diverse CD.

B0013ND30W|5.0|I was skeptical about buying an animated movie in blu-ray.  I can't even express how amazing this movie looks!  The color is outstanding, the scenery better than I would have ever thought possible.  All the dotty looks of the old-style Disney movies has been completely erased with this enhancement and yet, you lose none of the nostalgic feel.  The story is one of the best, as always and the characters are wonderful.  The sound is fabulous AND you get a bonus regular dvd with this purchase which I think is wonderful (Yay portible DVD player for trips!).  If you are on the rail about buying animated blu-ray like I was, don't be with this one!  I bought mine on sale, but I would have paid full-price for how amazing this looks.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B000002IFP|5.0|I have owned about about five copies of this album over the years.  They were worn out, borrowed, given away and maybe even stolen! Lol!  Honestly, this Simply Red album is one of the best kept hidden secrets ever.  Somehow, some way this superb collection of lush, slow songs and upbeat can't-help-but-dance grooves was overlooked by the public and robbed of a Grammy win.  It's quite simply THAT good.  If you've not heard it, prepare yourself to go nuts.  Enjoy!

No more annoying creeping sounds, just smooth.    One Drawback: When you pair it with a light body camera like my XT, it's gonna suck when you try to put it around your neck and go all day long, it's gonna make you tired very quickly since the lens causes the body to be inclined forwards.    Other than that, highly recommend!

0307388921|3.0|Not as good as `Invisible Monsters' (his finest work) or `Fight Club' (his most popular) or even `Lullaby' (his most insanely creative), `Choke' has to settle for being merely good.  It isn't great, and at times it is slightly bad, but at least it makes slightly more sense than `Diary' (his least satisfying).  I am a fan of Chuck, because even when he is beneath himself he is still above many others.<br /><br />Bad Palahniuk is still pretty darn good.<br /><br />I have a few issues with `Choke', namely that it rides so heavy on the preposterous that each and every character starts to lose credibility before the conclusion of the novel, but those issues never deterred me from actually reading the novel.  Chuck's style is very creative and absorbing, so even when I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, I was rolling them towards the page because I didn't want to stop reading.  Chuck has a way of always keeping you guessing, intrigued enough (maybe it's all those moments that make you ask `can he really be serious?') to keep reading, keep barreling through in order to uncover the inspiration for all his madness.<br /><br />`Choke' tells the story of Victor Mancini.  He is an addict (of the most perverse kind), he is a loser who failed to go through with his big dreams and he comes from the most insanely unbelievable background imaginable.<br /><br />Oh yeah; and he may be Jesus Christ.<br /><br />The story weaves through Victor skipping his AA meetings to feed his addictions, visiting his dying mother in the hospital, working his pointless job at a colonial-era theme park and killing time with his best friend Denny at strip clubs and collecting rocks (I know, I know).  In the meantime he meets Paige, a doctor at the hospital his mother is staying at.  She seems convinced that a risky procedure could save his mothers life (I'm not going to tell you what she proposes, because it really would kill that `what the...' moment that it is bound to create).  The question Victor faces is, does he really want to save anyone, let alone his mother?<br /><br />Palahniuk is known for pushing the envelope, and I admire him for that.  He knows how to hit us where it counts, how to engage the reader and turn his stomach at the same time he is turning his mind.  My complaint here is that Chuck may have gone a little too far.  Some of the scenes reach `American Psycho' amounts of explicitness, but unlike Bret Easton Ellis, Palahniuk doesn't know how to make his perversions intelligent.  In the end we are left with a novel that thinks it is establishing a groundbreaking prose on the adult male but instead is rattling off a list of impulses we are all familiar with yet repulsed by in the same breath.  It is entertaining in parts, mind-numbing in others, yet is always presented in Chuck's signature style, which makes anything readable.<br /><br />Palahniuk has been hailed as the author who finally got men reading again (for I cannot see women fully enjoying his work) and for that he should be commended.  The problem I have with that is that that statement paints men (his target audience) as generic Neanderthals who only appreciate literature if it is as graphic as it is simple.  I'm not knocking Chuck, for like I said, I like him, but as an avid reader (and a male) I find it rather insulting that this is the literature we are expected to enjoy the most.one, let alone his mother?

B00005JPNZ|1.0|How the heck could 145 people, and counting, like anything about this extremely stupid and ridiculous movie.  It's was bad the whole way through, and the aliens?  WTF, is all I got done saying.  I just couldn't get over the fact the I couldn't believe how old Harrison Ford looked.  Thankfully, I saw a bootlegged version, so I didn't sink any money into the pockets of anyone associated with this Hollywood garbage.
B00000K31V|4.0|[[ASIN:B00000K31V eXistenZ]] is a very interesting movie that follows the heroes as they try to succeed in the ultimate game of virtual reality.  Jude Law and Jennifer Jason Leigh must go through a series of challenges to unlock the game and it's secrets.  The thing that is most allusive about winning the game, is that it's not clear what winning means.  In fact, it's not even clear what is part of the game and what is not.  As they learn more and more about the inside and outside of the game, they come closer to solving the mystery of Existenz.<br /><br />This is not a new concept.  The idea of a thriller wrapped around a virtual reality game has been done many times, starting with [[ASIN:0783228457 Videodrome]] and continuing through movies like [[ASIN:B00000JSJC Strange Days]].  But what really sets this movie apart is the interesting way it's done; the overtones of attraction, the sexual nature of the apparatus, the philosophical struggle between reality and fantasy.  All of the concepts that make such an existential dilemma meaningful are here.<br /><br />The ambient filming and dark mood lighting of the film lend to a kind of overall *horror mystery* sort of vibe.  All along, we are trying to determine what is real and what is fantasy.  Are we in the game or out of the game?  The way the camera work is done is a big part of that.<br /><br />Similarly, the cast is top notch.  While one cannot always expect a good cast to yield good results, when it's combined with good writing the results are positive.  And that is what we have here.  Jude Law is consistent as ever, as is his co-star and the supporting cast.  All the portrayals are under-stated.  But the strong writing makes them impactful despite the methodical pace of much of the movie.<br /><br />The special effects are also nicely done. All of the effects have a role in the story.  The technology used in the game is given a weird appearance, as if it was a strange body part that was removed at birth.  All the little details such as these really made it clear to me what the message behind the movie was.  You will have to decide for yourself what your interpretation is.<br /><br />Because of the philosophical nature of the story, the movie can be somewhat preachy.  Not everybody is into that.  The ending also left me feeling like they took the easy way out so to speak.  Once again, you will have to make up your own mind.  No spoilers here!<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />If you are attracted to weird, thought provoking, horror mysteries, this movie is basically in its own category.  If you are looking for the simple scare and don't want a lot of preaching, this may move too slowly for you.  As for me, this is one the movies I turn to often.  As long as you are in for something far out, I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Enjoy.e really made it clear to me what the message behind the movie was.

B000YENUI6|4.0|I watched this on HBO last night. The plot is a very captivating, edge-of-your seat thriller. Although there is a lot of graphic violence, the characters, including the bad guys, are not entirely unlikeable. \\"Kirill\\" and his father possess at least a glimmer of a compassionate side (the way they interact with children), and Viggo Mortensen is spectacular as Nikolai (althought I should add, the extensive footage of his teeny ding-dong during the bath house fight scene left me a little queasy). That said, would it have killed the director to hire some actual Russians to speak Russian more believably? I had the hardest time making out what they were saying. Overall, a very entertaining film. In the end, all the loose ends are tied up nicely, and everyone ends up with the best outcome, including Nikolai, Kirill and the baby. The bad guys are punished, like they usually are in an American crime thriller.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|I really like this \\"quirky\\" off-beat film. It has a kind of \\"English\\" dry humor to it. If you liked \\"The hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy\\" you will like this film too. I liked this film enough to buy and send my mother a copy.
B0001FGBD4|4.0|I'm new (and apparantly late) to the SACD world. I bought a few from Amazon to check it out. This collection gives a nice mix of Jazz styles, vocals, strings, horns in many tempos. Not only A very nice sampler, but a nice mix to play to hear high quality in varied forms.

B001E1DJD4|5.0|I have to say that this music touched me deeply. Loved the instrumentation, the arrangements, the words, the heart and soul. Need music to sit and reflect upon love and lost love? Then give this body of music a listen. Disc 2 possesses a harder edge. Though short on minutes, it delivers the old one-two. I consider this CD a knockout. To my listening-senses, Rachel does not fit into the current young girl genre; she portrays her emotions on her sleeve. Very open and mature. I believe that there is, most definitely, a brain behind her exquisite beauty. Talented, beautiful, and revealing, what more can we ask of her? \\"Elephants\\" is a refreshing and satisfying experience.
0375826726|5.0|Excellent read. Christopher has lived up to the previous books in this series.  Can't wait for the next one
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I bought this on DVD having never even heard of the series before. I was immediately impressed by the story, characters, and the action. This is definitely a must own DVD for a Sci Fi fan.     This series touches on themes that the movies did not really address. The man vs machine topic becomes more complex and even cloudy at times as we see it in many different variations and addressed more in depth. What I find most interesting are the interactions between the human characters and the terminator named Cameron sent by John to protect John. The stories are very compelling. I very much look forward to season 2.
B0007OCG56|4.0|This is a very good movie...I bought it and still watch it every now and then.  The little girl narrating the film is amazing...and this is supposedly her first film.  Paz Vega is a force of nature in her beauty and grace...no one in American film compares to her.  Leoni plays a character that you just have to hate, but she pulls it off in a way that allows you to pity her at times.  No one suffers like Adam Sandler....suprisingly well played by him.  This is a funny and dramatic study of the culture collide.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|In 1989, Tim Burton's BATMAN set the standard for not just Batman movies but for all superhero movies for close to 20 years.  It stood as a touchstone moment in the history of comics and cinema, and few believed that it would ever be usurped from its pedestal as the greatest comic book movie ever made.    Sure.    THE DARK KNIGHT is a hell of a lot more than a Batman movie, superhero movie, or even a comic book movie.  What Christopher Nolan has done here is taken one of the biggest cultural icons of the modern age and improved upon it.    Back in 1997, a movie (which shall remain nameless) was released that made us all want to burn our Bat-collections, and it unfortunately stayed that way for a long eight years until BATMAN BEGINS injected new life into the character.  The film was successful and well-received, so WB gave the go-ahead for a sequel, expecting to make even more the second time around.    Well, they did.  They REALLY did.    For starters, TDK is the perfect Batman movie.  It has everything it needs and then some to perfectly satisfy the hardcore Bat-fans of the world (myself included).    Second, superhero movie fans will love it.  TDK isn't all darkness and complexity; there's plenty of car chases and explosions and fight scenes and action sequences with good guys fighting bad guys to make any super-movie fans giggle.    Third, comic book fans will really appreciate how seriously the movie takes is source material, and how respectful it is of not just Batman comics, but the whole comic book genre overall.    But that's not what makes TDK the masterpiece that it is.    THE DARK KNIGHT is the masterpiece that it is is because, to be perfectly frank, it's not a superhero movie.    Much like Batman, who's not a hero, TDK isn't a superhero movie.  This is simply a wonderful film that draws it characters and inspiration from the world of comics.  I know this because people that i've talked to that HATE comics and superhero movies LOVED this movie.    The superhero movie is dead.    The comic book movie is dead.    The graphic novel movie is here.    And it's about damn time.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This is a good movie...I bought it to watch parts of it from time to time. Some neat little \\"speeches\\" and great visual moments. I especially like Tilda Swinton (in anything) as the Angel Gabriel. The speech she gives near the end of the film is chilling in its simplicity and attack on the mystery of Faith.... And if you like Rachel Wiess looking doe-eyed and vulnerable...well there is a lot of that.
0385335997|5.0|What a roller coaster ride! The book left me breathless and smiling. It was one adventure after another with a few calm points in between. From what I gather from the other reviews, Voyager was supposed to be the final book in a trilogy. I'm SO glad it isn't. I can't seem to get enough of Claire and Jamie and want to know: \\"What happens next?\\" We meet old friends, new friends and old enemys.     As well as being a romance and adventure, it is a mystery novel. Bones were found in a cave in the Caribbean in the 20th Century and I THOUGHT I'd figured out who they belonged to but I was WAY off course. And a person I THOUGHT was dead, escaped it and was very much alive.     The books remind me of a couple of my favorite novels I read as a child: Treasure Island and Kidnapped. Gabaldon is a superb story teller and makes you feel as if your are living in the 18th century right along with Claire. There are memorable scenes in the book, ones that I found particularly amusing: was where Claire arrives in Edinburgh and discards the wrapping of her sandwich and where Jamie sees her for the first time after 20 years. His reaction to her sudden appearance after so long is simply pricless! And as to the wrapping that covered her sandwich...I wonder if any one ever found it?    At over a 1000 pages the book is long but well worth it. As always I love the historical detail that DG puts into the book. The daily life that people lived and experienced, while it might be boring to some, it helps put you in the time period. Most authors simply skim over what life was like, whereas Gabaldon delves into it and gives you a sense of how people might have lived back then. As I said in a previous review, I admire the research and time that must have went into the book to bring it to life AND make you stay glued to the pages.     I can't wait to start the next one!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using this style of earphones for 6 years of jogging/working out. Granted I buy a new pair roughly every 2 years, you cannot find anything more comfy and with the same sound quality. Don't waste your dough on anything else.
0375826726|1.0|As written by another reviewer \\"If you liked the Lord of the Rings series, then you'll probably like the Inheritance cycle as well.\\"    Actually, The Lord of the Rings trilogy was a wonderful, well-written trilogy. This fantasy series is in essence a great first showing (Eragon) with an okay sophomoric offering (Eldest) and a dismal current contender (Brisingr).    I hope that this was more the fault of the publishers than Paolini's own writing. In many places the writing actually made me cringe and want to break out my red editing pen of death, ex. \\"Pointing with her chin past a row of spits and cauldrons suspended over a bed of coals, past a clump of men butchering a hog, past three makeshift ovens built of mud and stone, and past a pile of kegs toward a line of planks set on stumps that six women were using as a counter.\\"    Yes folks, that is one, very long and exhaustive run-on sentence. Why they couldn't be bothered with proper grammar and punctuation we will probably not know.    I see no use of dramatic suspense in bridging chapters, or even within each chapter.  Most of the dramatic scenes seem forced, almost as if the characters are being coached by a high school drama teacher from behind the curtain, \\"Now in this scene Eragon, you feel ANGER.  Show me your anger, be a tiger and let it all out!\\"    All in all, I wish I hadn't picked up this book, because now I feel obligated to read the (nearly assuredly) fourth book of the series.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|When I was in college I went to the theatre and watched Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant interpretation of Mario Puzo's bestseller [[ASIN:0451205766 The Godfather]]. The stunning photography and sound transformed a very good Mafia story into an iconic piece of American culture. Over the years I have watched the Godfather and its brilliant sequel in various formats, film, VHS and DVD. But finally when the trilogy was restored by Coppola and his incredible cinematographer Gordon Willis I broke one of my cardinal rules about acquiring Blu-ray versions of movies I already own in DVD.    I watched on my [[ASIN:B0018C7FSO Mitsubishi LT-46149 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Integrated Sound Projector]], which fully optimizes Blu-ray disks in a 1080p format. Just to be sure I compared it with the original triology[[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)]] on the same set using a [[ASIN:B000UMY5W2 Sony BDP-S301 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player BD/DVD/CD Playback with Bonus HDMI Cable]] which \\"upverts\\" standard DVDto 1080i.    There is no comparison.The colors are deep and rich in Blu-ray, while they are faded and scratchy on the \\"upverted\\" DVD. The overall effect of the restoration is to bring that original movie onto that original theatre screen into my house. Even though Godfathers I and II have never lost their place in the pantheon of American film, we have for years been watching these films under less than ideal conditions. The darkness that surrounds Don Corleone and then Michael became more dark gray than near-black. In its 1080p restoration the vermillion Statute of Liberty rises from the flat marsh grasses looking more like amber waves of grain than a neutral killing field. Taillights twinkle against the buffed exteriors of post-war automobiles as Michael exits the restaurant after killing a rival don and a corrupt police captain.    In Godfather II the 1080p again recreates the feel of the original cinema release, subject to a few clearly enhanced scenes. In several of the lake scenes (excluding Fredo's last bite) the water seems bluer and the mountains purpler. As many Godfather aficionados know the lake house was actually on the California side of   Lake Tahoe. From the back yard the mountain profile Heavenly is unmistakable, establishing the California address.     The prequel segments featuring De Nero are bathed in sepia-like golden hues presumably as an antique finish that seems more reminiscent of Traffic than the theatrical rversion of Godfather II. It might be easy to say that the \\"restoration\\" has in some places done more than recast a damaged negative. However like the Star Wars recuts that used contemporary special effects technologies to create new virtual sets unimaginable in the 1970's, this restoration was the product of the original director in collaboration with the original cinematographer. These artists (and only they) are entitled to enhance their work using tools that help explain their original vision. this is not the colorized version of The Maltese Falcon whose pastels reeked havoc on a film noir classic. There is no reason these two films should not be works in progress by their creators.    The second issue relating to any enhancement is of course the viewer. It has been 36 years since the public has watched a fresh print of the Godfather. Since then we have seen it in less than optimal circumstances on over the air analog television, VHS, standard DVD and even Betamax. Each one of these formats substantially degrades the original film with poor resolution, pan and scan editing, and sloppy sound mixing. With so many exposures to these two classics under less than perfect conditions it is slightly presumptious to attempt to say what it looked like back then.    A 1080p Blu-ray version is a close as any average consumer is ever going to come to having a a fresh print. The bonus is that unlike a fresh print the digital imagery and sound will not fade, scratch or be formatted for television. In 38 years when Francis and Gordon (and I) will be likely be gone from this world this vision will be as fresh as it was today and in 1972 and 1974.     I have no comment on Godfather IIII, which is a poor cousin to the first two films. It is good to have, if only to show that money drives Hollywood and even great directors.
1416575464|5.0|Domino Magazine came on the scene in 2005 just three short years ago. It melded fashion and decor and immediately energized the shelter magazine market, appealing to 20 to 40 year olds, and finding an even wider Baby Boom audience. Its hip and refreshing \\"how to\\" attitude to creating your own pretty decor soundly resonated.<br />Even the professional designers presented had a homey approach using revamped flea market finds, big box store items, and their own personal products.<br />It provided a \\"power to the people\\" approach. Everyone can shop at a flea market, Target, CB2, or eBay, etc. The message is: Everyone has access to a happy looking and pretty home.<br />Domino The Book Of Decorating is written by the magazine's editors, and it continues the grass roots philosophy of the magazine, using their own homes and thought processes and sources as examples.<br />The book is written is a fun and breezy manner, and it reminds me of another book: Decorating Is Fun! by Dorothy Draper. This 1939 (!) classic has recently been reissued, and it's enduring advice is timeless and current. I think DTBOD has the same appeal and chance to become a classic of it's time (and possibly a candidate for a nostalgic re-issue 50 years from now).<br />The book is published without a dust jacket, a compact volume, very beefy and satisfying in the hand. It reminds me of a text book, and indeed it could be considered as such for anyone who loves decor, whether you are the home decorator, layman, or professional.<br />So do buy this enjoyable book, and get happy being your own decorator!<br />If you are lucky enough to be able to hire a professional (and please do!), this book will help you understand the nuts and bolts of decorating, and allow you be a proactive participant in this fun and exciting process.

No thanks; I'll just wait till it hits the bargain bin, and I'd suggest you do the same. It's a great show, but come on, it isn't THAT great.
0553573411|4.0|Truly after having become instantly enamored with Assassin's Apprentice, Royal Assassin had me hooked before I even finished the first page.  I will begin this review with my sincere puzzlement in the fact that there is so much overhyped fantasy in the world by highly decorated (see award winning) authors that it amazes me to no end how the Farseer trilogy tends to slip through the proverbial cracks.  This series is easily on par with the efforts of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire and perhaps some of the finer moments of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time.<br /><br />That said, this tale picks up literally where the first book ends (with no recapping) and continues in the first person narrative of Fitz Chivalry as he recounts his life in effort to document the history of the Six Dutchies.<br /><br />Like before, the imagery is just stunning and Hobb once again demonstrates that her greatest strength as an author is through development of incredibly rich characters that the reader can't help but feel like they know personally.<br /><br />Perhaps therein lies the greatest source of frustration mingled within the beauty of this series: Robin Hobb isn't afraid to let the bottom drop out and does so very frequently.  They say that hopelessness is a powerful literary tool (and certainly a motivator to turn the pages in effort to find resolve).  The trouble some have with Hobb is that resolve is painfully slow to come (and often times doesn't come at all).  Readers were treated to a taste of this in the first book but it pales in comparison to the mental and physical torture they will endure through Fitz's eyes in this one!<br /><br />Without giving away too much of the plot's key moments, let me just summarize by saying that nearly everything Fitz has worked for comes crashing down by the conclusion of this novel.  How Robin Hobb plans to tie up all of the loose ends of the saga in the third entry (Assassin's Quest) is truly anybody's guess.  Although I must confess that it will be nearly impossible for anyone (regardless of how frustrated) to finish this book without desperately seeking the third entry with ravenous passion.<br /><br />Upon completing Royal Assassin last night, I concluded that:<br /><br />1) Robin Hobb may just be one of the most powerful authors in our time and certainly one of the most under appreciated in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />2) This series is absolutely gripping in every sense of the word but requires a reader willing to \\"ride out the storm\\" in the distant hope that resolve will come.<br /><br />3) Readers who rely on fantasy to escape the drudgery of daily life/ world affairs may want to steer clear of this entire melancholy-riddled saga.  This book has the ability to cast a gray cloud over the mood of even the most optimistic reader (that can follow into real life).<br /><br />4) If you decide to forge through this book, have the third entry handy- it ends on such a note that you just may find yourself standing outside the bookstore at dawn waiting for them to open.e for anyone (regardless of how frustrated) to finish this book without desperately seeking the third entry with ravenous passion.

0375826726|1.0|This book is as slow as a tortoise with arthritis, and at the end of the painful slow-march you realize you haven't moved much, from where you stopped in Eldest. It is painfully obvious that Paolini was made to (?) prolong this series. The actual plot can be told in about 100 pages; the rest is either horribly drawn out descriptions or meaningless and repetitive conversations.    Some scenes go like this (not the actual words, but you will get the drift):    Eragon: Saphira, isn't it wrong to kill people?  Saphira: No young one, sometimes you have to do what you do, for the greater good.    Now, this is blown into a page-long dialogue where they repeat the same question and answer in passive voice, reported speech etc. I felt like stuffing Eragon into Saphira's mouth to shut them both up. When one thinks they have finally reached a consensus and the plot will move on, they move to another track:    Eragon: Saphira, I love you  Saphira: I love you too, young one.  Eragon: I can't bear to be separated from you Saphira, not even for a moment  Saphira: I can't either...  Eragon: Saphira.....  Saphira: young one....    I felt like shouting \\"Get a room!!!\\", before I remembered they were a dragon and rider, not star-crossed teenage lovers. Then, finally, the coddling was over and I started hoping again that something would happen.     Enter Arya...    Eragon: Arya, baby, how do you feel while killing someone?    I fervently wished she would show him instead of telling him :)
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Been listening to this album pretty much every single day on my way to work and back since it was released. (I've got a 45min drive) I really love it and am excited to hear it live this Halloween in Chicago. But with that being said, Because of the Times was ultimately a better album.  A little more substance and awesome instrumentation.  Not that Only By the Night is bad by any means, just not amazing.  It is definitely one of those albums I'll put on the shelf once the newness wears off.  And I probably won't listen to it for a long time.  However like I said in the subject, 7 out of 11 songs are good.  Can't say that for most of the albums I purchase anymore.  So should you buy this CD?  I say yes...if you dig KOL.  If not, no worries.  You won't miss much.     Top 10 albums in the past 20 years    10. Pearl Jam - Ten  9. Smashing Pumpkins - Melon Collie & The Infinite Sadness  8. Fiona Apple - Tidal  7. John Mayer - Continum  6. The Strokes - Is this it?  5. Weezer - Blue Album  4. Queens of the Stone Age - Era Vulgaris  3. Alice in Chains - Unplugged  2. Dave Matthews & Tim Reynolds - Live at Luther College  1. Radiohead - Kid A
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Review of the Blu-Ray copy (5 stars out of 5)<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Has good video/sound quality.  The picture is a bit grainy and fuzzy, but is clearer than the regular DVD.  It has good color and some parts are sharp.<br />*Includes three episodes from the Beetlejuice cartoon show (brings back memories), a music-only track, and a trailer.  It is a bummer that there aren't any more features, but this is still better than previous releases, which had practically nothing.<br />*Includes a CD sampler disc, containing six or so tracks.  One of the songs is the \\"Bannana Boat Song\\" by Harry Belafonte.  The others are pieces of the score by Danny Elfman.<br />*The movie is great.  It is wild, zany, cartoonish, but never overly goofy or childish.<br />*Filming style and cameramanship is good.<br />*Production design is great.  It is macabre (like any Tim Burton film), but also imaginative, funny, and sometimes really funky.<br />*Lots of great make-up effects and special effects.<br />*The characters are great and memorable.  The acting is excellent all around.  The writing is great, for there are lots of funny memorable lines.<br />*Excellent sound design.<br />*Excellent music.<br />*My copy came with a cool lenticular slipccover.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Special features are in standard definition.<br />*Don't know if I'd reccomend it to most young kids.  Contains some morbid material (death, ghosts, monsters, etc) and some swearing (including one really bad swear word).  Rated PG.<br />*I imagine that some people may be put off by the craziness.<br /><br />I might be a bit biased, since I grew up watching this movie (and the cartoon show) relentlessly.  Still, it really is great.  The story is good, smart, well-written, and has an excellent cast of characters/actors.  The dialogue is funny and memorable.  Above all, it's highly imaginative, with its fantastic settings, costumes, special effects, and creature effects.  Highly reccomended to anybody who is even remotely interested in Tim Burton or horror/comedies in general.

0793542049|5.0|Depending on your knowledge of theory, for me this is by far the best beginner book I have come across.  It really communicates to you the different ways to start walking in which many books fail to do.  My lesson teacher told me to get it.  Of all the walking bass books I've looked at this one makes a lot of sense.  Definitely a must buy if you want to learn how to walk bass. Mel Bay Walking Jazz Lines for Bass by Jay Hungerford is also a good book to check out, but definitely get this book by Ed Friedland.

0393316041|5.0|The reviews here claim that Feynman was an egotist and it stained the reading of this book. However, I disagree completely. Feynman never claims to be self-deprecating or modest. In fact, I appreciate his candidness!    I was afraid to read this book because it was recommended to me by a Physics graduate student, and because I am not one to enjoy nonfictions. However, this book reads like a novel. Each chapter is another story or era of Feynman's life. It's like an excited little kid talking to you-- no complex sentences or incomprehensible jargon. I finished it in just a few days, and I was left wanting more! I am not a physicist at all, and Feynman only briefly mentions certain Physics concepts to describe what he was doing with them, usually finishing them off with a \\"yadda yadda yadda\\" or the like. You don't have to be a Physicist or a genius to enjoy this book. It's breezy and short, and you can read it in pieces. It will make you smile, and if you happen to also be a scientist, it will make you think (but not too hard). I recommend it to all of my friends!
0786711647|4.0|BOOK CLUB REVIEW    A Kiss Before Dying  by Ira Levin    Our book club's book for October was A KISS BEFORE DYING, by Ira Levin.  A lot of us didn't know that Levin had started out doing traditional mystery/suspense before turning to horror (STEPFORD WIVES, ROSEMARY'S BABY, etc.)  We were talking about how much, as a group, we enjoy shocking plot twists, and one of us said that A KISS BEFORE DYING has one of the best plot twists of all time.  We took that as a challenge and decided to read the book.    It's tough to describe the plot without giving away too many details.  But I will try:  It's the story of a social-climbing, money-grubbing young man who decides the best way to live an idle life is to marry a girl with money.  (Several of us noted that the concept is far from unique--isn't this the main plot of so many Gothics, and isn't this the way it was done in the world until very recently?)  He thinks he has it made, but then the girl gets pregnant--which is problem, because her widowed father is a prig and will likely disown her when he finds out.  So he decides to take matters into his own hands...  (And this is just the first few pages of the book, but it does give a good idea of what the book is about.)    I can't say more because even trying to describe the book, its structure, and its tricks would give away the pleasures of the read.  Suffice it to say that we took a vote, and of the twelve of us in the room, ten said that the book does indeed have the single best plot twist they'd ever read.  I mean, it's really, really shocking and surprising, and it's testament to Levin's abilities a writer and storyteller that he gets away with it.  When you realize what has happened, you sort of shake your head in disbelief, but then you go back and re-read some things, and you see how Levin made it happen.    The more interesting discussion was whether the twist is \\"fair\\" and if it plays by the rules or not.  We talked for quite a while about that, and the conclusion we came to is that this kind of trick can only be pulled off in writing.  If you read the book, you will see what we mean.  Again, I can't go into details for fear of a spoiler!    The book is a very fast read, and it seems to be more from a different era because of the way the characters are drawn.  They are pretty two-dimensional, and you either like them or you don't, which is fine for whiling away the time with a good mystery.  We had some good discussion, too, about the ending of the book, and whether we liked it or not.  This is so frustrating--I'm afraid to said anything more because I know it would be a no-no to prejudice readers' ideas about the book before reading it.    All told, we were glad we read this, and we were sorry that Levin didn't do more with the traditional mystery/suspense book.  Then again, if you are only going to write one mystery, A KISS BEFORE DYING is a heck of a thing to have written.
B00004SVID|5.0|i was one of the few lucky enough to be at the fisrt long island show on feb 24 1980.not that i had a ticket. all the money i had(about300.00)could'nt get me a ticket. luckily,myself and 9 others paid a ticket taker $25 apiece to slip us threw without a ticket.10 minutes before showtime.those were the days.absolute classic recording.thanks again mr. ticket taker 28 years later.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|After several viewings and much thought, all I can say about this movie, in seven words or less is, \\"My God, what a totally fantastic flick!\\"  A film, which I only finally saw (but had heard about, many years after it hit theaters and later DVD and cable).  I really cannot say how great this film is, but I'll try.  Note however, that on Amazon's rating scale from 1 star to 5, if I could, I'd give this SIX stars, but am limited to five.  For this is a work which rises above the five star Amazon rating level for me, and few films have ever done that actually.  Overall, despite some minor stumbles along the way, and many, confusing non-linear moments which occur throughout, I can seriously say this is certainly one of the most unique, touching, and mind-expanding movie efforts I've seen in a long, long time. It entered my top 20-50 films of all time quickly at the very least, when I first experienced it, and continues to move up, upon repeated screenings and reflections.  That's saying a lot because my list of such top films of all times includes dozens of great films, too many to name here.<br /><br />This is a small and independent but yet, GREAT movie, and is a must-buy for those with the funds and who loved/love this right off the bat as much as I did/do, because more viewings not only add to one's understanding and appreciation of it all, but will over time, as it has for me, simply add to one's thinking about it all deeply afterwards and lead to finding new meanings in various scenes and ideas/insights.  Basically. \\"Donnie Darko,\\" if you see it and you enjoy it upon initially watching it and re-watching it as I did (and still do), is a strange, wonderful enigma of a film, which you will come back to, for further and deeper appreciation.  With the rather obtuse at times, and certainly non-progressive temporal structure however, repeated viewings and closer attention, almost seems essential for a full appreciation of this masterpiece.  Along with so many various interpretations from viewers, if you collect DVD's, and fell in love with this film early on, as I did originally and much later on, this is really a movie you'll want to come back to and watch again, many times.  While my review does not distinguish between released DVD versions, I can only concentrate on the basic product, which in its original film, is really something special.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to begin to describe this absolutely amazing movie/film, which I found so surprisingly fascinating and unforgettable and great, when I first saw it, and since have, upon repeated viewings.  As a general rule, I have never written short Amazon reviews, since my main deal here has been to try to impart upon readers, more in depth thoughts on all things entertainment-wise.  I could just say, \\"this is a little-known, but important, cult-ish example of what Hollywood/Independent cinema can be, and mandatory viewing for any real, thought-stimulating movie fan,\\" or \\"it is a complete and enlightening surprise from beginning to end,\\" but I will instead just give my totally personal opinion (with a lot more words) that this is a film which everyone should see at least once.  Whether afterwards, they get the same mental digestive overdrive reactions I did when I first saw it and which has been validated by seeing it again and again, is unknown to me.  Because I loved this movie the very first time I saw it, and watching it again has only reinforced that opinion.  I would hope to believe others have experienced this gem as much as I did originally, and have found enjoyment from repeated viewings.<br /><br />While this film is, indeed, very non-linear. which is usually a quality which more often than not, has turned me off to so many other such movies besides notable exceptions like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" \\"Go,\\" and \\"11:14.\\" \\"Donnie Darko\\" is very deliberate in its intent and purpose, and its oftentimes ambiguous nature, is just one of its many charms.  If you first see it, andlike/love it, you'll eventually refer others to it, if for no other reason, than for that of trying to search for other's explanations as to what it's all about, from others besides yourself.  However, if one first experiences this little jewel of a film and doesn't quite understand/appreciate it, I would advise one to simply devote the time if possible to watch it again, and again.  In time, I would trust that it will all eventually become clear, what this enigma of an independent, but Hollywood release, really means.  While some unnecessarily may want to over-interpret this, or dismiss it entirely from a possible feeling of just being too lazy to simply THINK, to me, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is simply amazing.  Whether watched initially, repeatedly, and/or thought about later.<br /><br />I came to eventually see this film long after its original release and subsequent impact, as I have so many other great movies, but in the new century,  That does not diminish its importance and meaning to me as a truly great cinematic effort in the long run, and this new century film holds up very well, with anything from the last few decades.  It is a one of a kind, at the very least, and I only wish more modern-day films came to equal this cinematic excellence.<br /><br />I could go on to list the many stars and their fine performances, including Jake Gyllenhaal (our teen-aged hero which this middle-aged man can still truly identify with), his sister in real life and in this movie, \\"Maggie Gyllenhaal,\\" Mary McDonnell, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore, and Jena Malone among others, but let it be said, this is a great cast.  And their characters all perform key roles in the overall whole.<br /><br />\\"Donnie Darko\\" is one of the best films I've seen this century.  It is strange, open for debate as to meaning, but entertaining and compelling throughout.  The film style is original and effective, the soundtrack and appropriate \\"songs\\" right-on, and the whole film, while dealing with some rather disturbing and/or depressing subjects, is a winner from frame one to the last frame.  If you have never seen this, by all means, do.  If you have, a lot of what I've hinted about without spoilers, should touch base.<br /><br />An unforgettable experience, I watched this in amazement the first time, and have since, upon every repeated viewing.  One of a kind, tight, and almost perfectly presented from beginning to end, along with a near perfect cast, directorial style, and musical background, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is truly a must-see experience.

1400063515|4.0|This is the book I drag around everywhere, you can only read a few pages at a time because you need to think while digesting. the author is very knowledgable - sometimes too knowledgable, but that's a good thing, because he has a lot to say, a different point of view, a chip on his shoulder, intelligence to burn, a worldview bought to american shores, and he is conflicted about the class system - shrugging his shoulders at the suits, but flinging out big names here and there. No matter, it is worth the price of the book, because he stimulates thought.  A sure sign of a good teacher, as well as tossing out more than a few investment strategies and his well-concieved notions about our financial system.  Love Taleb and hate him.  I look forward to whatever he is working on now, and will go back & buy the Random book that everyone keeps referring to.
0156030209|2.0|Having been raised by Great Depression Era parents I was steeped, as a child, in that greatest of all sins- waste. This sin is most noticeable in contemporary writing. I have railed for years against the prose broken into lines that passes for poetry these days, not stating it's prose merely because it lacks music, but because it goes counter to the notion of concision as a poetic ideal- the most said in the fewest words. Of course, real prose is not immune to the sin of waste. Contemporary memoirs, such as Dave Eggers' A Heartbreaking Work Of Staggering Genius go on for hundreds of pages when they lack the well written paragraphs and actual story to fill even a ten page short story.<br /><br />  Such is the case with Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life Of Pi, which comes in at 354 pages, yet is, at best, a solid-good short story of perhaps 25-30 pages, consisting of perhaps five of its first part's 103 pages, twelve or so of its 215 page second part, and eight pages in its final 36 pages. Add in a few pages to connect and there you'd have it. But, I'd still have advised Martel to go back, condense the tale, then add some leavening narrative connectors.<br /><br />  As it is it is a bad novel, whose critical praise seems dependent upon its being merely a bad novel vis-&agrave;-vis its competitors horror as novels. You see, Martel actually tries to do something different than the self-indulgent, flatulent prose that passes for fiction these days, and for this alone the book has gotten wild praise. Yet, the truth is that risk entails a greater chance of failure, and Life Of Pi fails grandly, however nobly. Part of why it fails is the setup the author gives the novel in a postmodern, self-serving, Author's Note that starts the book. In it he tells how he stumbled upon the idea for the story, is a `story that will make you believe in God.' Already the savvy reader is thinking anything less than something on a Moby-Dick scale is gonna really piss me off. I can assure you that this book is no Moby-Dick. What a tag line like that was really angling for was a nod as an Oprah book club selection....The lack of any deep thought can be summarized in this excerpt from a Martel interview: `The theme of this novel can be summarized in three lines. Life is a story. You can choose your story. And a story with an imaginative overlay is the better story.' Except that Martel's `real' story of Pi is better narrative, and better written, as I've shown. That he does not get this is because his whole argument is that imagination, be it Pi's fabulous tale, or religion, is always better than the real. This is in line with his nonsensical PC damning of religion on the one hand, yet accepting it as the better alternative, on the other. Thus, all tales and religion are one, and Pi comes to love Richard Parker, the tiger, for the two are also one. Real deep, I tell you. Or, as Martel says through Pi: `Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat-wearing Muslims.' Were this a sly dig after a real exploration of depth it might be a good wink or feint. But, this is truly the level of analysis and depth Martel provides about the differences in organized religion.<br /><br />  Boy, it would be hard to come up with a more banal revelation than `God is good because God is not real life'. In other words, God is a myth, but a nice myth that gets you along. Yet, this is a major fulcrum. Of course, since Pi rejects the major religions, yet accepts them all, he is really a New Ager that picks and chooses reality, and can therefore feel able to get away with utterly meaningless statements and those void of profundity- like the first sentence in the book: `My suffering left me sad and gloomy.' Wow. I always thought suffering left one with wisdom and joy! Isn't that a koan, too? Art and suffering. No? Oh well, if the bookcan be willy-nilly in its approach so can its author. The only positive thing that the opening line, in retrospect, gives is that no one should be expecting any greater level of profundity nor insight later on. This is a very lowest common denominator book that only appears deep to those suckled on Dave Eggers-level puerility. Any deviance from the poor norms of the day are praised just because they are different. As for the ending- there is too much explaining, after the real story is revealed, as if the obvious parallels and symbolism could be missed by anyone. Not to mention the pointless, and hell-mell, use of a weird font when Pi is interrogated.<br /><br />  As with so many other books that reach print I have to ask `Where the hell was a competent editor?' 350+ pages? C'mon! This is a possibly solid 25-30 page short story, and maybe a decent 80 page novella if there were some meat added, in the form of well-written passages, and a real aim. Because it has neither any props I might be tempted to give it for trying I take back. It also leaves little for a reader to imbue, because it does not involve a reader, but most telling of all there is not a thing here that no one else could not have written, and the indelible stamp of a particular writer is the hallmark of a great writer. There is none here. In a sense, with all the animals, I felt I was reading a sort of bad Babar tale from my youth, save there were no elephants. This is not Moby-Dick, nor is it a lean The Old Man And The Sea. It is a banal, half-hearted endorsement of religion, and a gray mush of a to b to c writing that really does not deserve such explication, but what the hell? If Yann Martel and Pi Patel can waste 350 or more pages of my attention then I can take a few pages to warn you. That's karma, or caramel, or something in between, sort of like Life Of Pi, or a slice of pie, or....I shall not waste!roach so can its author.

B000GPIPVU|5.0|This is so good it hurts.  I have listened to it over and over with rapt attention.  The texture is rich, the poetry, thoughtful.  The final five tracks create a beautiful sequence, particularly the couplets eight and nine and ten and eleven.  Tracks ten and eleven form one song in two movements and create such a haunting experience that I was frightened on my first listening.  I cannot recommend this high enough, and this is after a couple months of consistantly listening to this album.  It is my favorite LaMontagne album thus far.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Director Sergio Leone may always be best remembered for the three westerns he made with Clint Eastwood, but, without doubt, his finest work in that genre came later with ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968), available on DVD in a superb 2-disc special edition from Paramount Home Entertainment.<br /><br />It may be a bit on the slow side, but ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST is never dull.  Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda, Claudia Cardinale and Jason Robards star in this magnificently photographed epic that is part \\"spaghetti western\\" and part homage to John Ford. (His westerns were also \\"slow\\").  Indeed, Leone's footage of Monument Valley is as stunning, if not more so, than anything that Ford ever put onto the screen.<br /><br />The story concerns Cardinale, a New Orleans whore who has married one of her customers and come West.  Upon her arrival, she learns that her new husband and his children have been murdered...by Fonda. (A brilliant bit of reverse casting).  He works for the railroad, which wants her late husband's land.<br /><br />Robards is cast as a likable outlaw, framed for the killings by Fonda, and Bronson is a harmonica playing gunfighter who is stalking Fonda for some enigmatic reason.<br /><br />The film is enhanced with an exceptional recreation of frontier life, fine performances and many unforgettable moments, such as the 10-minute opening sequence, in which three gunfighters, including veteran bad guys Jack Elam and Woody Strode, wait silently at a desolate railroad station for the train carrying Bronson, their prey, to arrive.  \\"Did you bring me a horse?\\" Charlie asks them.<br /><br />Elam glances at the three horses behind him.  \\"Guess we're one shy,\\" he says with a nasty grin.<br /><br />\\"No,\\" replies Bronson, \\"you brought two too many.\\"<br /><br />Elam's grin disappears.  And then, the gunfire erupts.<br /><br />Ennio Morricone wrote the background score for this truly great western.<br /><br />DVD extras include audio commentary with contributions from directors John Carpenter, John Milius, cast and crew, three documentaries including interviews with Cardinale, Gabriele Ferzetti and others, plus much more.<br /><br />© Michael B.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|I'm going to keep this short and sweet (my two cents, if you will).  I really think the members of Depeche Mode are geniuses.  This CD is simply amazing -- every song on it is good (most of them superb) and exhibits the utmost amount of detailed craftsmanship.  In a nutshell, this album is very dark, and very intense, and it probes very deeply into that festering cauldron of a cesspool that we call the mind.  But just like a favorite addiction, you just can't say no to it.  Definitely eerie stuff to be sure, but in a beautiful and breathtaking way.  I also like the fact that there's a healthy mixture of tunes as far as tempo is concerned.  My three favorite tracks are \\"A Pain That I'm Used To,\\" \\"Precious,\\" and \\"Lilian,\\" but you don't have to worry, because you won't find any bad ones (well, \\"Macro\\" doesn't excite me very much, but it's still an above average song by most standards).    I believe all Depeche Mode listeners should own this disc.  It's basically a no-brainer if you are a true fan!
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I know that most people are not in line clamoring to see a musical, but this is one is different.  It's not very often that you find a tale of love, revenge and horror all wrapped nicely into a musical.  Sondheim's score is beautiful.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter completely embodied their respective characters.  Sacha Baron Cohen's appearance was enjoyable.  And who doesn't love Alan Rickman!  There is a lot of blood in this movie, but I would consider it more cartoony than flat out gore.  It's touching, it's funny, it's sick, it's enjoyable, it's dark, it's Sweeney Todd and it's a 5 star movie.  I'm not out to change the world and get everyone to suddenly watch all musicals because not all musicals are good (ie: Rent), but this one is definitely the exception to the rule.
0553381407|5.0|Do you walk on eggshells around your parents? Do you dread seeing them, really? If so, chances are, your parents are toxic and they have you under their control. I have since realized this after 36 years. This book almost appears to have been written by me as it captures what happened in my past and recent relationship with my parents. Get this book! They are crazy and you no longer have to buy into their loonyness! By the way, I just saw a counselor and she said that the first person to either leave the family or get kicked out of it is the healthiest. GO for it; run! You can't change them no matter how much you pity the crazies!!
B000L212F4|5.0|This documentary has everything you need to know about Dylan, without all the bourgeois intellectualizing. Forget all the books written about him, or other documentaries. Scorsese's No Direction Home is a merciless ripoff of DA Pennebaker, molded into a more narrow-minded view of the artist.    I've tried reading a couple of bios and can't stand all the interpretations and re-interpretations of the artist and his songs. This film, which was way far ahead of its time when first released, lets Dylan, his music and his mystique all speak for themselves.     Pennebaker also directed Monterey Pop Festival, another must-view.
B000I2IT44|5.0|A great band performing great songs. The dvd itself is pretty good in terms of presentation and features, but it's the footage of the band live that is what it's all about for me, and in this respect, it rocks! If you like this band, it's a must-have. If you're still on the fence about them, then you will LOVE them after seeing them perform on this dvd.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites and I show it to everyone that comes over to my house.  I  love the enchanting but true story line, don't miss it!
0375826726|2.0|Seriously disappointing. Perhaps Mr. Paolini lost his intentions once Eragon was written. I thought that Eldest was too long-winded and short-plotted, but Brisingr is a disaster. The story doesn't move and leaves the reader wanting to simply skip whole chapters to see if there is anything worthy of staying with the book. Sadly, there is not. Why would I want to read yet another (4th) book? The original idea of a trilogy seemed interesting, but sadly it missed it's mark in plot, character analysis and overall reader interest.   If you are still \\"dying to read it\\" - I highly recommend you don't waste your money and just get this one from the library. Better still - INSOMNIACS take hope ... this book (even on audio with the outstanding reader!) is sure to put anyone to sleep!  The TWO STARs go to the wonderful reader of the audio edition. Sadly even he could not keep me engaged with this book.
B0018BB20W|4.0|Well, I was never crazy about the 1997 remasters of the \\"core 7\\" period of the Moody Blues music.  I listened to the original cd releases next to the '97 remasters, and really found little difference.  Now, with the 2008 new remastered classics, the difference is clear!  The sound is truly crisp and has a sonic clarity like never before (at least on cd.)  I've read all the arguments about the \\"quad\\" versions picked for remaster here, but overall, I cannot complain about this new sound.  I wish the \\"Peak Hour\\" track didn't have the analog crackling after the lyrics are over (at its end.)  But, DOFP is a recording that is over 40 years old.  Actually, it holds up rather well, all things considered!  I love the Moody Blues, and I am so happy that I found a cd version of DOFP that I thoroughly enjoy.  Lastly, the bonus tracks are amazing!  There are five here from the \\"Prelude\\" compilation, a cd of non-album tracks.  I'm so glad to have these songs on cd, since \\"Prelude\\" has been out of print for some time.  I like the other bonus tracks as well.  \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" allows us to hear what the Moody Blues sounded like in 1967 in the studio off the cuff.
B000089A06|4.0|This completes my collection. I like the first one, but this re-make sheds more light on Hannibal.
0385341067|5.0|\\"Everyone called him Popeye.\\" Thus begins Mister Pip, an eloquently written story about how profoundly literature can influence lives. As Popeye evolves into Mr. Pip, the personalities and character traits of the islanders also emerge. Mother and daughter, war and resistance, husband and wife, civilization and nature, life and death, black and white, nurturance and abandonment - these are dichotomies around which this novel plays out. Mister Pip is narrated by a young woman looking back upon her teen years on a remote Pacific island, who begins to come of age under the tutelage of the substitute school master. His true name is Mr. Watts, and he is the only white person on the island, having married one of its inhabitants. Every day, he reads part of Great Expectations to his mixed-age pupils, and the world opens up to each of them in a different way.<br /><br />Dramatic, evocative, and filled with hope, sorrow, and a touch of mystery, Mister Pip has deservedly won numerous literary prizes. This is an important book with a timeless, unforgettable message.
0440238609|5.0|His Dark Materials is a really good series of books.  I've never been much for fantasy, nor have I read a lot of children's books.  Harry Potter looks boring, so I've stayed away.  My draw to these books started with a an e-mail forward last Christmas, one of those alarmist e-mails trying to convince me to boycott the movie due to its \\"atheist themes.\\"...I wanted to see what all the controversy was about, what could rile up the e-mail mob.<br /><br />Pullman's story is fascinating.  Yes, his story does challenge authoritarianism and dogma. He does so in a way that not only entertains, but provokes thoughts, forcing the reader to challenge his beliefs on human nature.  The story isn't necessarily anti-God, as much as it deconstructs the mythology we've created around the worship of God.  This theme isn't in any way heavy handed...the story is also one of two children growing up and developing their own worldview.<br /><br />Despite all the symbolism and controversy, these are 3 very good books that were fun to read.
B00005A46T|3.0|...as far as Slipknot is concerned this is apparently the album where they attempt to be alot more \\"dark\\" and \\"technical\\"...have slipknot succeeded in this attempt of theirs? Have they dropped the power chords? Let us see...let us see...    515 6/10: Another random intro track of random low feedback combined with them randomly shouting in a horrified manner...if you're anything like me it's more likely to make you laugh then feel uncomfortable...unless you want to take the innuendo then it may be slightly scary...    People = (The magic S) 8/10: Begins with power chords and explodes into a full assault...corey doing his \\"I'm a macho screamer man\\"...the random turntable affects are still apparent in this song...and so are the downtuned guitars...what impresses me is that the power chords take more of a break...they're actually attempting to play riffs this time...even though they're not that difficult (I looked up the guitar tab) it's still in some ways an evolution...I also noticed that Corey's lyrics have become the stereotypical \\"I hate myself\\" jargon...so that's another evolution...all in all this track is rather strong...nothing special but it's very heavy and makes a nice change to the previous album...I can see what they're trying to do...I just hope they learn that the equivalent to people is not what they excrete...unless they're maggots (no pun intended)...    Disasterpiece 8/10: Surprisingly heavy song(how?)...the drums double bass intro is very delightful and the guitars have truly evolved now...no crazy power chords...just very low down tuned riffs...which of course isn't 100% improvement but it's definetely a step in the right direction...Corey seems to have given up melody and decides to feel the swoon (which makes no grammatical sense)...after messsing randomly around though the structure gets kind of boring...they seem more tightened and it bothers me...if they want to shock they should say something interesting...not to say that Corey's songs are irrelevant...I just wish he'd...OH MY GOD I HEARD THE BASS!! An extra point for that...it ends with corey singing kind of...but the instrumental arrangement doesn't really change key at all...when it does I'll be happy...    My Plague 7/10: Yawn...lets play the same thing over and over again and change in the chorus to a weedy melodic vocal line...why do I hate myself Corey? WHY!!? Honestly this song is nothing special at all and really gets boring after a while...and again...Corey's song themes are really mundane...I'm not saying he can't sing...just sing something about confusing metaphors that makes me think (e.g. Converge, The Locust, Mars Volta etc...I'm not going to name drop)...the \\"everything's depressing\\" thing is ok...just make it more intelligible ohterwise you'll just have teenies and people who grew up with you and stay with you for nostalgia as fans...    Everything Ends 9/10: I like this song...the melodic arrangement of the guitars is quite pleasant to hear...a very evil sound to the descending scale in the chorus even if the verses contain the crazy powerchords to which the debut was saturated with...unfortunately it seems this time round Corey's lyrics are the weak point...everything else is so strong (even the crazy sound effects contribute very well) and his voice has no trouble singing...he just needs a more interesting lyricist...the instrumental break after the second chorus is also very heavy and strong even though yet again it's panifully easy to play on guitar...a very good song and well recommended for starters (it's still under scissors on the previous album though)...    The heretic anthem 7/10: Oh dear oh dear oh deary me...this accursed random addition of a satanic reference...and for what purpose? To irritate christians? Pointless provokations without any subtlety just turn me right off a track... \\"If you're 555 then I'm 666\\" that must have been so hard to work out...instrument wise the drums are fantastic yet again but you can hardly hear them...the guitars are just those silly riffs which now seem to be getting old...maybe they should revert back to there pointless power chords just for a little while...oh Mick and Jim...you are such lucky boys...if you like being satanic for no good reason then go for this song...otherwise it'll probably just annoy you...    Gently 9/10: SEE!!! YOU CAN PLAY A GUITAR WITHOUT AN AMP!!! The beginning starts with some very nice accoustic guitar playing...I really wish they'd play like this more often...having heavy and intense power is ok but at least here you can feel emotion in what they're playing...or maybe that's something they develop in their later albums...who knows...of course afterwards they turn the amps on again and play but they seem to play things more reminiscent of the era that tried to rip off the melodeath era...but to me any change was welcomed and I enjoyed the instrumentation at the beginning...alot...it gets kind of awkward when it sounds like Corey has developed a Swedish accent for about 10 seconds...but then he starts shouting again...there's no denying where their influence for this track was...but I'm so so so glad they did something different...    Left behind ?/10: Any mark I give this song would be biased...when I first heard this song 3 years ago (when I was 14...I know I'm pathetic) and saw their faces I was so scared I changed the channel...a year later I really enjoyed the song for a while...the melodic hooks within the chorus and verse really connected with me...now I feel half-hearted about it...it's the song on this album I've heard the most though...if you've heard this song and think that it'll be filled with songs like this one...be warned...this song has been garnished and specifically niched for the mainstream audience...the songs in the rest of the album are far more explicit...    The Shape 8/10: Another heavy track this time...double bass drumming and a distorted medium pitched (MEDIUM!!? WOW!!) riff that turns into a quiet little slumber...Corey's lyrics are still rather awkward but more bareable...haha...I thought he said \\"I lost my ointment\\"...but that's not what he says...the guitars throughout seem to be doing the exact same thing as on everything ends only lower down the scale and to a little less affect...and plenty more powerchords...a heavy song...just nothing new to the table...    I am hated 7/10: Heavy song...talking...guitar riffs...turntable effects yada yada yada yada yada...nothing new or interesting at all...and Corey's lyrics are irritating me so so so so much right now...    Skin Ticket 7/10: Starts off with some distorted guitar wavering all over the place (possibly a whammy bar?) the bass drum in this is a very nice addition...until turning into another downtuned low riff that's just played heavily for the sake of it...and they all stop to let Corey say his piece...which is slightly better as it leads to Section B very briefly after returning to the heavy and boring Section A...his singing of \\"come see my cage\\" is nice and soothing and makes me want to go to sleep...the harmonics between the bass and guitar at this point is very consonant and sucessful...well done...and it wouldn't be slipknot without reverting back to the heavy section...good show...pip pip tally ho...there is then a guitar solo of alternate picking until they decide to go heavy again...will they ever end on a nice melodic note? No...no they shan't...    New Abortion 7/10: Starts off heavy (again) and then turns into a mad frenzy of drumming until structuring around Corey's voice...the guitar makes some nice squeaky sounds but does nothing interesting with that episode...the other guitar stays low and plays a pentatonic (check) scale...another heavy song...just not particularly interesting...apparently I can take Corey's soul...    Metabolic 7/10: Very interesting electronic percussion affects that yet again revert to downtuned guitar riffs...ENOUGH ALREADY!!! They need to learn some variety...I know they're potentially good guitarists...I HEARD GENTLY!!! Corey has a bit of a random sing song between shouts...but it sounds more like a wimper...again...it's ok...but doesn't require analysis because the only thing different is the random electronic percussion that sounds like a squashed puppy...    IOWA ?/10: This song is all over the place...I usually love epic songs that are over 10 minutes long...but this is nothing new at all...it's the same slipknot songs dragged out...think of the verse of Purity off the first album only four times slower and with a lot less explosion...I don't think slipknot understand the concept of progression as well as they should...it just seems to end with Corey making awkward noises and the drummer trying to make it sound interesting...the guitars get lost in their own atmosphere and just seem to plink in and out of the awareness of the listener...it was a very good concept but in contrast to Scissor is a very bad closer...    Overall:    Drums: As great as they always have been...complex cross rhythms and many good fills...    Bass: Improved...I heard it alot more in this album even if it was only in 3 tracks...    Guitars: Improved...from power chords to a downtuned riff...they should try something new next album...    Vocals: Lack of improvement in lyrical meaning means that the themes seem somewhat childish and meaningless...hopefully he'll get better    ...all in all this album is heavier than the previous...more tight and structured and different variaitions on the same theme...if you prefer heavier and less rap influenced Slipknot buy this...    ...I now delve into their 3rd album...which of course is the album they made most mainstream success...will they add more variety to their heavy formula? I shall find out...
0307388921|5.0|This is the first Palahniuk book I've read, and I look forward to reading more of his books.<br /><br />Based upon the description of the book, this isn't one that I'd likely pick up to read...the redemption/recovery/whatever you call it of a sex addict just didn't seem that interesting.  However, Palahniuk throws in enough twists and symbolism to make this a very entertaining read.  The book was hard to put down.<br /><br />The story was so graphic, that it was hard not to laugh every time he talked about \\"throating a dog\\", or his \\"white soldiers.\\" The main character gets into some strange situations...every chapter is filled with another surprise.
B00000JCOV|4.0|...as far as Slipknot go they have had a rather sucessful career...many adoring fans (maggots? The patriotic references are rather disturbing) and of course their music is played on mainstream metal radio stations across the globe...    ...their image has always been one of the quirks that repel certain people thus drawing in others...making random people shout out words such as \\"THEY'RE SATANIC BECAUSE I ASSUME THEY ARE!!!\\" And awkward controversies (spellcheck) meant they were seemed as \\"different\\"...the look has of course been done before my mushroomhead but I'm not going to go into a copyright ramble...    ...so what did I think of their first album? I can understand why people would like them but their methods of execution aren't that interesting...after a while Corey Taylor's shout runs dry and turns into a paste of long drones along with the guitar...but I'll give you a track by track analysis...    7426(do you really want me to write out all the numbers?) 6/10: Yes it's only an intro track...but I expected something more...there are more interesting things you can do with sampling (AKA the industrial era) and they do nothing but make it slightly higher up the scale or slightly slower...but nice try...    (sic) 7/10: Not bad...starts off with a very heavey and simple guitar riff where of course their rap iuinfulence is shown by unecessary adding of a turntable...the downtuned guitars at this point may seem somewhat entertaining and powerful...but after a while your ear will become so accustomed to the sound you can't hear it anymore...the drummer is fantastic...and always will be...his technique is very impressive and he pretty much could carry the entire band as I love percussive music that is reliant on rhythm...Corey's voice starts of fast and of course when a change of pace (not key unfortunately) appears later on his voice becomes more toned and slightly manic but nothing astounding...a good start...but of course it left me wanting something more interesting...    Eyeless 8/10: I like the drums at the beginnning...the main riff at the beginning is very reminiscent of Converge's \\"The Saddest Day\\" only less staccato and a lot more sloppy...this riff is then replaced with another predictable low downtuned fast paced riff...Corey's voice goes from talky to shouty and the main hook (california eyes something) is a memorable hook...but rather irritating...it's an improvement as the structure isn't binary (ABAB) and I can only hope after this there will be more imporvement in the next track...is there? Perhaps a new guitar tone? Once again the rap influenced is shown by random unecessary turntable sounds...    Wait and Bleed 8/10: I hear this first time round I don't like it...Corey's voice isn't suited (his real singing voice) but of course it grew on me...and the main verse with his shouty singing is very catchy (WOW HE HAS DREADLOCKS!!) But it all seems to collapse to mediocrity in the chorus...the melody isn't strong at all...guitars yet again follow the rule of low powerchords mixed with single weak pitch bent whiney high notes...yet again the random turn table rubbish gives pointless sounds a new name...and I love Merzbow...    Surfacing 7/10: A repeated guitar ostinato this time consisting of a high note repeated over and over again that somehow keeps reappearing through some random power chords and alternate picking...Corey's voice switches between random shouting and random talking...the drums can't be heard that well in this track...and although it may sound like it's pretty annoying...it's not that bad...the chorus has an interesting syncopated (you might want to check though) rhythm...but yeah...overall my mind says meh...it's not exactly really technically, melodically or harmonically interesting...lots of power chords and random turntable noises that are starting to annoy me...alot...    Spit it out 8/10: The video was amusing...and of course this song has the most rap influenced vocals in it...but honestly?I deep down like this song...yes it's simple but the chorus' contrasting with the verse is very very pleasant to hear...and you know what? The guitars are actually bareably more origianl this time...turntable noises are still present...a good single...    Tattered and torn 9/10: Starts with some random noises of wind and bells...turning into a toy box like sound...the guitars are very inventive this time round and I like the random noodling...Corey's voice is all over the place and the structure is an absolute mess...I feel right at home with music like this...it reminds me of all those unmainstream bands...oh how I miss them...overall a nice sweet and short song...I like the direction they're going in with this...perhaps it'll turn into a main thing in the next track? Perhaps...perhaps...    (I am reviewing the original version of this album...no \\"me inside\\"...instead two other tracks that are slightly better)    Frail limb nursery 7/10: Another short track consisting of sampling...random talking...the only thing they add to it is a random bleepy life support machine in the background...and random sounds...followed by a very quiet drum and bass track leading to...    Purity 8/10: ARE YOU READY FOR MORE POWERCHORDS!!? YEEEEAAAAAAAAAH!!!! And of course guess what? TURNTABLE NOISES!!! This is what the intro consisted of and I was like \\"Here we go again\\" but then it all calms down...the drums continue on very dominantly with Corey very nicely chirping away to himself...but then of course...it explodes back into the main riff...and then fades...the structure is ABACACA...section C is probably the best melodic section they've made...the backing vocal track harmonises very well and the tune shows of things yet to come...until of course they return to a variation of Section B...the difference being Corey says more...stuff...but of course Section C saves this track quite well and because I'm very generous I gave it an 8...good ole me with my spinelessnes...    Liberate 6/10: At this point the heaviness is starting to wear incredibly thin...I get it Corey...you're annoyed and Mick and Jim (check names) like their downtuned guitars and their power chords...now please please please show more variation...the drummer gets it...I mean look at him go...the other 8 people should be ashamed...making Joey do all those complex cross-rhythms...this song is heavy and it has a heavy riff...but if you're like me and have a varied taste in music this may drag out to you a bit more by this point...or maybe it's just me...most likely...oh yes and Corey screams quite randomly at the end...enjoy...    Prosthetics 8/10: Starts off very promising...a dark and eerie feel with the guitars being nice and calm...is there going to be more power chords? You might think...no...instead you hear a girly scream and the addition of the bass to the formula...it all sounds like an interesting composition they are making...it sounds different and quirky...Corey very calmly enters with a nice dark and electronically altered voice...the echo is stuttered out...but of course...they then revert to power chords...so so so so close...but...the chorus has a very nice sound...the double tracking with Corey's voice has yet again added another element to the harmony this time in the baritone of the voice...and for a while...it was good...then follows some sort of random solo that is the the same few notes played really quickly over and over again (grade 3 guitar work)...and then Corey shouts alot more yada yada yada and it's then all repeated until it ends with the scream again...    No life 8/10: More rap influence...the drums come in very well...the rest is the same old same old...and guess what? YOU CAN ACTUALLY HEAR THE BASS AT TIMES!!! And for that I gave it an extra mark because I bet that bassist gets pretty lonely all the way in tones of pitch that are hardly ever heard...chorus is an attempt at singing with no change in the power chords...at this point in time I feel Iheard this track already a few tracks ago...but still...it leaves its mark...    Diluted 8/10: The guitars are tiresome...on the plus side Corey saves the song quite well with his vocals...besides the cliched theme he has very good rhythm and control over his voice on this one...the chorus fumbles a little but the instrumental breaks before the verses are nice and eerie...I'd rather not analyze the guitars due to the fact that they are becoming incredibly bland right now...it makes me sad...oh and another plus...the DJ gasmask guy is actually put to good use this time round...hurrah...    Only one 7/10: POOOOOOOOOOOOOWER CHORDS!!! This song is rather fast paced and somewhat intense...I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't heard the same thing over and over again for this long...but it has some very interesting changes to it...and there are parts where the guitar try different ostinatos...Corey tries another singy chorus...and...I don't feel anything for it...it just feels like it was slotted in in the last minute to make the song more polyphonic in texture...    *(best song on album)*   Scissors 10/10: The only track that really convinced me there was some incredible technicianship between this band...starting off with random drum brushes and steel drums with a slow crescendo of guitar static...the bass enters with a fuzz pedal incredibly distorted and sounds like a pedal note...very unlikely though...the guitars then have a distorted ostinato...it all increases gradually over the crescendo...and fades for Corey's entrance...he adds very nicely to the atmosphere which starts to be very \\"stop and go\\" until it explodes...the guitar is bareable because it is a very simple riff to start with...it grows into a power chord march but unlike the other times it's slow enough to take in the notes...it then returns to a diminished version of Section A only to revert back to an instrumental break variation of Section B...\\"Biding my time until the time is right\\" is then the words that are repeated over and over...and turned into a new theme (AKA section C)...it then all slowly fades and slows down for a while...the bass carries on the tune and the guitars remain squeaky and feedback-like...Corey's voice re-enters and section D begins...high pitched guitars and steady percussion...the guitars get more complex and Corey's voice gets more angry and the percussion goes more all over the place...his screams then grow more insane and then suddenly fade...we are left with an awkward and confused Corey and crazy sound effects and a guitar that sounds like it's just sitting there for the sake of it...it then returns again (Section E) for Corey's final word...quick power chords and a crying Corey...the reason this took the longest to analyze is because it's the best song...if you buy one song off this album...buy this one...    (hidden track)Eeyore 8/10: Since it's an extra track you can't expect that much right? Yeppy doos...just consisting of fast and ridiculously over the top rhythmics...one for the adrenaline rush but just seems out of place...ending with Scissors would have been so much better...but of course if you enjoyed all the other above tracks 100% then don't miss this one out...    ...so how has the exploration of my first subject and first album gone? Better than expected...although the guitars are very often power chords on drop D tuned guitars there were times when I liked the songs on this album...it could potentially be a grower if I gave it more time...Scissors is a fantastic song and so is the percussion section of the band (well Joey anyway)...    ...I wonder what I shall find with IOWA...the album that is rumoured to have dumped the rap influence...therefore abandoning the annoying turntable sounds...I shall find out soon...    ...if you like Slipknot singles and want to find out more about the band's strong aggressive side and don't mind nu-metal then buy this album...if like me you're somewhat picky...maybe you should test your sample first as with everything people buy...

8590379825|4.0|Lua isn't a complicated language, honestly. If you're coming at it from another language, especially ones with simpler syntaxes like PHP or VB, you'll feel right at home. In fact, it's so simple you could easily pick up most of the language's workings just by looking at other people's code, and building your own from there. That said, not everyone likes to learn that way. Some people, myself included, like to have a reference book that they can pick up at a whim, skim to the topic that they're struggling with and find a solution. That's what this book excels at: reference, and teaching by example. It's a great buy for anyone looking to get into Lua scripting, and a nice reference guide for those already fluent in other languages.
B000KG499M|5.0|This display stand has to be one of the best Ive ever seen. While it comes with accessories to help in the displaying of smaller gundam models, I find that this particular stand is to larger and would over power the focus for anything smaller then a 1/100 or master grade scale gundam. It does come in pieces but it is a very easy build, as it only took me ten minutes or less to finish it. Also with this brand of stand, custom connectors for each gundam can be found in most of the newer Bandi master and perfect grade gundam kits.
0312427999|4.0|The Shock Doctrine is a fascinating exposé on the dark side of unrestricted capitalism when it is implemented through blackmail, extortion, military force, and the suppression of democracy.  Naomi Klein provides numerous examples over the last 50 years of countries who upon falling into financial and economic crises, desperately turn to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for financial and economic assistance to stabilize and rebuild their economies. These countries soon discover that the World Bank and IMF are staunch promoters of capitalism and free-market economics, and will only provide aid on the condition that unrestricted capitalist policies be instantaneously and shockingly adopted by these countries, using lethal force if necessary, to suppress existing socialist ideologies and organizations, and even to suppress the will of the countries people who may be democratically opposed. This is what Klein refers to as \\"disaster capitalism\\", the introduction of unrestricted free-market economics in crisis and disaster situations with the short-term goal of engaging in excessive profiteering, and the long-term goal of assuming absolute control of those economies. And when disaster capitalism is implemented with the shock therapy approach normally associated with modern torture techniques, we have what Klein refers to as the \\"shock doctrine\\".     In every example cited by Klein, where countries were literally forced to adopt unrestricted free-market policies (privatization, deregulation, trade liberalization, cessation of government spending, cessation of unionization, suppression of democratic assembly, unrestricted foreign ownership, unwarranted price increases, higher taxation, and intentional mass unemployment) in order to receive financial and economic aid, these countries went into an economic death spiral as their state resources and infrastructure were sold away to foreign owners for cents on the dollar, and the foreign owners were under no obligation to re-invest back into the countries economy. The financial assistance received from the World Bank and IMF was not used to benefit the newly created masses of poor and jobless people who needed it most, but instead was used to benefit the promoters of disaster capitalism.     The only drawback to Klein's book is that she tends to blame disaster capitalism on its economic architects, and not on the governments and corporations who sponsor it. Consequently, Klein's portrayal of Milton Friedman and the Chicago School of Economics as evil incarnate is unwarranted. There is nothing wrong with capitalism and free-market economics when it is implemented under the right conditions. Klein fails to recognize the fact that these economists were acting not just as economic agents of the World Bank and IMF, but also as foreign policy agents of the US government, and globalization agents of American multinational corporations. Klein also fails to acknowledge that these same governments and corporations were engaging in dishonest, unethical, undemocratic, and even criminal behavior when promoting their self-serving political, social, and economic agendas. One fact is clear from Klein's book, disaster capitalism as a means to globalization and American world dominance will not work in countries that embody true democracy.

B001E75QGG|4.0|Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but If I do with my ramblings then I apologise. The year is 1957 and a group of soviet soldiers break into a secret military base with an aged Indiana Jones. They want him to lead them to a box containing a mysterious mummified corpse which will help lead them to the powerful yet mysterious crystal skull. When they manage to locate the crystal skull and return it to its original resting place, unknown powers will be unleashed that if returned by the leading soviet lady Irina Spalko, it could mean a drastic turn in the cold war for the west.<br /><br />Now myself, like many others were doubtful that a fourth Indiana Jones film could work just as well as the originals. Not to sound ageist but the age of Harrison Ford was one of the main concerns when playing such a role. Literally from the first few scenes starting with the warehouse, my doubts were squashed. Harrison seemed on form with his action sequences, although I'm sure the stunt double played a particularly larger part in this instalment. Accompanying Indy on his missions this time around is a young, cocky, motorcycle riding 60s clich&eacute; called Mutt (LaBeouf). Don't worry though because this instalment isn't just starring one original cast member as an old Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Marian Ravenwood comes back to reclaim Indy's heart. Oh and she's also Mutts mother, see the connection there?<br /><br />The action for this film is easily the best I've seen from any Indy film and that's including the classic boulder scene. Of course the CGI was destined to play a big part in a new Indy film and it really does. That doesn't take anything away from it, however, as the CG really is flawless and presents the environments with a genuine rapport to them.<br /><br />Overall it's a genuinely good film, the ending is a bit random and in some ways disappointing. It keeps the classic humorous moments in over the top situations, I have a genuine respect for Harrison Ford for what he's done in this film. He's shown that he can still hang with the young action stars of today and it definitely had its passing of the torch moment in relation to LaBeouf. I would recommend it to any film lover and wouldn't separate it from the entire Indy series as it's definitely kept the trend of being a satisfying action movie.'s done in this film.

0385340990|5.0|I rarely give a book 5 stars- BUT this one has it all. Well-drawn and interesting characters, an incredible setting, dire circumstances, suspense....and even a tiny bit of romance. It is told in the form of letters-an epistolary tale, an unusual and often difficult way to tell a story. But it works beautifully here.<br /><br />Set in 1946, following World War II, author Juliet Ashton receives a letter from a man, Dawsey Adams, who has purchased a used book by Charles Lamb. This book has Juliet's name and London address written inside the front cover. Touched by his love of Lamb, Juliet goes out of her way to get him more books, and replies, asking him more about some of the stories in the first letter, specifically the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, formed during the German occupation of Guernsey.<br /><br />Continued correspondence entices Juliet to visit Guernsey, to try to find a subject for an article she has been commissioned to write about the reading habits of the Society. She may even find a subject for her second book in the stories of the occupation she has heard from their letters. The letters even distract her from a burgeoning romance with a handsome and wealthy American publisher.<br /><br />Mary Ann Shaffer, who had worked as a librarian, editor, and in bookshops, wrote the book over a number of years, found an agent, and as the editing process began, became ill with cancer. She died in February of 2008. Her niece and author Annie Barrows finished up the editing process, hence the co-authorship.<br /><br />Armchair Interviews says: If this reviewer, a librarian raves about this book--we must say: \\"Highly recommended.\\"

First two were bought for my nieces . . . but I kept them for myself. They never cease to cause  attention. Once at a crafts fair, someone remembered me from the previous year because of the watch. They're fun, they fit all size wrists, all-plastic causes no allergic reactions, and they bring out the inner child in us all. The only negative is that Lego used to make it with a bigger face. And after you've lost a few of them, you end up with enough spare parts to go really color creative. Amazon has the best price of anywhere too.

Between Nikki's diary entries there is recent written commentary looking back at the time period that the diary was written by Nikki, other members of Motley Crue, their managers and Nikki's friends.  Even if you aren't a big reader, you won't want to put this book down.  It is INTENSE!
B001CISHU4|5.0|When I first heard Amon Amarth I knew they were talented.  They've grown exponentially through every album, layering the guitars and vocals to sound HUGE.  This album has everything from the sing alongs they are famous for, to the intense death metal songs like \\"Twilight of the Thunder God.\\"      The album features guest appearances from Children of Bodom, Entombed and Apocalyptica.  But, they were built in such a way that they are repeatable live.  Although, the guitar solo in \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" is going to be hard to do I'm sure.    The DVD that comes with the disk is also amazing.  It features a live concert from Summer Breeze 2007 where they had a Viking ship on stage.  Lots of pyrotechnics and fire.  Overall the best live performance they've put on video so far.  I really loved \\"Cry of the Black Birds\\" and \\"Without Fear.\\"      This is a must buy.  If you love Amon Amarth you are going to love this album.  If you love good, solid death metal you'll appreciate it as well.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I love the series, Sex and the City. I own all the DVDs. Unfortunately, while these DVDs played well when I first got them, they deteriorated in quality. Some of my DVDs are un-playable. I even replaced certain seasons so I could watch favorite episodes, only to have these DVDs go bad as well. My DVD player is excellent and I have many DVDs of different things. I never had trouble with any except the ones of Sex and the City, so I know it's not my player. Did I watch these DVDs often? You bet. Since I loved them and enjoyed seeing them again and again. However, I have played and replayed other DVDs too such as Law and Order: SVU with no diminuation of quality.     Not only do the Sex and the City DVDs go bad with repeated viewings, the containers they come in are of shoddy quality as well. They are made of brittle plastic which breaks easily. The sets do not contain a list of episodes. It seems HBO just made them as cheaply as possible. This is a shame because it was a great series and deserved better handling.

B00009RAJJ|2.0|It's sad when an album is released after an historical one and it bombs. How does this happen? Where did it go wrong? I'll tell you. Lindsey Buckingham. As a solo artist Lindsey Buckingham has a unique style all his own. Even a couple of solo hits. Not many. But still he can hold his own to a point. The great thing that makes fleetwood mac successful is Fleetwood Mac. The formula for making great and inspiring music is the efforts of this band as a whole. There is no recreating this magic. It is what it is. Take away or add from that formula and you have a disater waiting to happen. Sadly when ego's are not in check this happens. Such is the case with Lindsey. The band should have never let him get away with all the creative control he had. It was not fleetwood mac rather Lindsey's Buckingham's Fleetwood Mac. Everyone knows that this is why this album bombed. At least with Stevie Nicks she knows when to throw in the towel. She may offer up her songs, but she offers them to Fleetwood Mac as a whole and it turns out to be a work of Fleetwood Mac rather than just Stevie Nicks. This is important to note because i'm not some huge stevie nicks fan but she's great WITH or without fleetwood mac, she most definitely can hold her own. Need I remind everyone Dreams, which she wrote, was the only fleetwood mac song to go to number one...ever. She just knows how to seperate the two. Lindsey cannot. It's obvious he took his creative control to a level in which he should have saved for himself. I'm thinking it had to be because maybe the rest of the band feared he would have quit, another mistake. Remember when the ship is sinking you are all still going down with it. I blame all the other members of the band for allowing this to happen. Tusk had great potential. But only a few songs were worthy of that fleetwood mac style. Storms, Sara, and Sisters of the moon are the only stand outs. Yes most die-hard fans would disagree. But those are the only \\"fleetwood mac-ish\\" songs on the entire album. Considering that it was a double album that's not good. Others will say, \\"well it's way ahead of it's time\\", well Lindsey is NOT Frank Zappa. So don't put him in that catagory. Again, most die-hard Lindsey fans will be the first to disagree and respond in anger. The numbers do not lie and even most fleetwood mac fans will reluctantly admit that they hated this album and it was their worst one by far.

0132350882|5.0|Books like Clean Code are much more worthwhile than any \\"Learn the latest hyped technology API now!\\" book. Clean Code will never be outdated while specific technology books have a shelf life of six months to two years.     Whatever language or API you are working in, you will find solid advice in Clean Code on how to write code that is effective and that you can take pride in.    You may disagree with some of Martin's specific advice, but you will still learn a lot by understanding his reasoning for a particular practice.    Bob Martin is a wonderful writer, which is a rarity in the technical book field. His prose is as concise and effective in communicating his thoughts as the code that you will write if you take the time to learn from the master.

0765318741|4.0|It's beyond me to understand how horror fans can go on and on about their favorite horror novels as if they were masterpieces by Pynchon or Nabokov.  The bottomline about \\"I Am Legend\\" is simple:  it's about loneliness and loss in a post-apocalypse world overrun by vampires.  If that doesn't cause you to dissolve with laughter, then \\"I Am Legend\\" might be for you.  It's well-written, holds the reader's interest, and has been the basis for three movies.  It will appeal to most teenage boys (or to grown up men who remember how the world feels to teenage boys).  However, it doesn't deserve five stars because it doesn't have enough cool details about the end of humanity.<br /><br />I didn't see \\"The Omega Man\\" when it came out in the early 1970s.  However, one of the kids at my junior high school got to see it, and he described every detail of the story to me.  I was captivated.  Now I'm almost 50.  Now Charleton Heston is dead.  I am legend.

B000YAA68W|5.0|plot: Marjane Satrapi grows up during the rise of the fundamentalist regime in Iran.<br /><br />animation: Lovely deco art style, it reminded me of Edward Gorey in some ways, and propaganda posters in other ways.<br /><br />languages: french and english.<br /><br />This film has a wonderful sense of reverence for family history, and at the same time a wonderful sense of irreverence for the local political ideologies which grip Iranian culture today. If you don't know what happened to women's rights when the Fundamentalist's rose to power in Iran, this film explains these things with simple, tough charm. It's important that this film even exists, imo. I think everyone should see it, whether they like it or not- it will give you alot to think about and hopefully, talk about.<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />If I have one problem with this film, it's that as the main character grows older and more disenchanted (while trying even harder to fit in) with the intolerance towards women in her society, the story turns to several pointless romances.  After an hour and a half of feeling like a witness (thru Marjane's recollections) to an avalanche of personal tragedy and the humor that comes with surviving it, we jarringly go into a weird romantic interlude, where Marjane has a string of crappy relationships, gets married, gets divorced, leaves Iran yet again (and presumably for good) at which point the film ends.<br /><br />Kindof like someone pulling the needle across the vinyl before a good song ends, and I understand she's making a political statement about how she feels; that there's nothing she has left but the memories of her family, uncle and grandmother... its just that the romantic interlude cheapened the power of it.<br /><br />For this viewer.<br /><br />Still a damn important cultural document, though.  See it.

076790382X|4.0|This is the 2nd book I have read by Bill Bryson. I enjoyed it!  I admire someone who can take normal life in America and write with such humor. I found myself giggling every few paragraphs.  Such talent this writer has.<br />Basically this book is filled with essays that are organized by chapters.  He writes about all kinds of things about America, after moving to New Hampshire after living in Britain for 20 years.  He writes about baseball, shopping, lawyers, over-the-counter medicine, drive-inn movies, computers, waste, airplanes and taxes among countless other things that sets America apart from other countries.  The thing I love about Bryson's writing is, I learn something as I laugh thru the pages.  His outlook on things is sometimes like reading my mind and putting it on paper.  I highly recommend these books and look forward to reading others by this author.

I found it to be a satisfying wrap up to a story line of a series  that I have enjoyed  since the original theater movie came out. Of course any chance to see Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping  again would get four stars, minimum from me.

Their background was interesting, but I could have read it online.  After making a few of their recipes we decided we liked our old standby (which is one of theirs as well):  2 cups milk, 1 can sweetened condensed milk (we use nonfat), then you can add a little more sugar if you like, an egg, almond and/or vanilla extract.  Mix and use your ice cream freezer.....easy and delicious with whatever extra goodies you may wish to add!  Save your money and buy a little better ice cream maker!

B001E95ZNI|5.0|Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) are a pair of traveling lawmen for hire.  When they arrive at the town of Appaloosa, the town fathers are more than willing to pay the price and accept that Cole IS the law.  They're under the thumb of rich rancher, Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) who shot their former sheriff in cold blood.     They get a break in the case when a young former hand of Bragg's agrees to testify.  That happens about the time when the widow, Allie French (Renee Zellweger) comes in on the train.     Allie complicates matters a lot.  As Hitch so eloquently puts it, \\"she wants to be with the herd stallion and there can only be one of those at a time.\\" Cole, who claims to not have feelings, actually does care for French.  She's not like any woman he's ever been with, she's clean, she's got good manners, etc.      \\"Appaloosa\\" has all the elements of a great Western, a little romance, some realistic gun play, excellent characterization, great scenery (principal film site Austin, Texas) and the typical western sense of humor.  For example, when a gun battle gets both men injured, Hitch says, \\"That was quick.\\"  Cole's response, \\"Yeah, everybody could shoot.\\"    Clearly, Harris and Mortensen had a lot of fun making this film.  These two are friends in real life and this project was a labor of love for Harris who said in an interview that he's a fan of the author of \\"Appaloosa,\\" Robert Parker.  He usually reads the detective novels, but picked up the Western because he liked the cover and that's how the movie came to be.      If you enjoyed \\"Pale Rider\\" and \\"Unforgiven,\\" this is a film you'll probably want to see.  The \\"R\\" rating is for a little language, small nudity, and violence, but both my husband and I have seen a lot worse on broadcast television.    Rebecca Kyle, October 2008
