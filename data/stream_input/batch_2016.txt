1449415881|5.0|This is the third year I have had the Dlbert Day-to-Day Calendar and it is the best way for me to start my mornings at the office. Always funny and a lot of times dead on for our office life. It's is definitely a must have.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Honestly I'd say this was one of THE best books I've ever read. I can't wait till the next book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the most awesomest game ever. I love it u will like it a lot<br /> don't worry<br /> so ya don't read this its stupid.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Very original and a must read if you love a good romance and vampire tales. Meant for young adults but enough mystery and intrigue for all!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I mainly got this album because I like the song Thrift Shop but every song on this album is a song that I could listen to for hours.
030758836X|5.0|Read other reviews on Black Bifocals- a book review blog!    [...]    The first thing I do when I read New York Magazine is turn to the last page and read The Approval Matrix. On the week of June 11, 2012 Gilllian Flynn's Gone Girl was featured and read \\"a thriller with an insane twist and in insidiously realistic take on marriage.\\" I generally do not read thrillers or mysteries but I had nothing in my queue and the \\"insane twist\\" description was alluring.  Too much of a summary runs the risk of ruining this deliciously crafted, suspense filled treat. In short, Nick and Amy are an unhappily married couple when Amy goes missing on their five year anniversary.  On each anniversary, Amy plans an elaborate scavenger hunt a reluctant Nick is expected to embrace.  The clues she leaves behind this year and the police investigation add to the ever increasing suspense of the book. The book alternates between Nick's take on his crumbling marriage and Amy's thoughts as revealed through her diary.  Nick's clear distaste for his wife and Amy's saccharine diary entries reveal the disparate feelings each spouse holds. I was so glad I knew virtually nothing about Gone Girl because as I read, my incredulousness grew leaps and bounds.  Ordinarily I become very frustrated when mysteries take too long to unfold or when the author tortures its readers by providing no satisfaction until the very end.  My general lack of patience does not jive with drawn out answers.  What I especially liked about this book is the constant gratification Flynn provides and the endless stream of more craziness that promises to unfold.  I will divulge that getting inside the mind of a psychopath was beguiling and had me wishing I had the same intelligence (minus the crazy component).    This is one of those books where you wish you could suspend time and just read.  Any obligations or responsibilities will be met with annoyance on your part.  I found myself ignoring my visiting sister, wishing my kids went to bed at 2 PM, and setting a bed time for myself so I would not lose the inordinate amount of sleep I require in order to function.  My DVR recordings dangerously read 97% full.  I missed The Real Housewives of New York and Orange County, Nurse Jackie, and Girls (show pics). On a side note, if you have not been watching Girls on HBO, you are missing out on a real gem.  But I digress.    I finished Gone Girl in three days.  It might have taken longer, but I was lucky enough to have an appointment with a new doctor over an hour away.  I used the long trip as an excuse to leave the house exceptionally early. I was dreading the appointment so I justified giving myself extra time to find a coffee shop and read once I found the general location of the office. After reading for a looong time, I begrudgingly went on my way.  As I sat in the paper gown, immersed in the continuously growing plot development, Dr.  \\"K\\" entered and my heart dropped.  I immediately recognized her from high school, but she was not in my graduating class.  I said nothing until the very thorough examination ended.  I could have kept my mouth shut because I was confident she had no idea, but my curiosity forced me to confirm my suspicions.  She graduated two years ahead of me and her younger sister had dated my brother.  Rather than die of embarrassment, I asked for my out of reach Nook before she left the room to bring me some samples.  Why the story?  I was too absorbed in the book to imagine the conversation she might have with her sister, her friends, her colleagues, her husband, her neighbors, or passing strangers at my expense.  I did fire off a quick text to my best friend about the incident, but I went back to reading instead of dwelling on my humiliation.  I have recommended Gone Girl to readers and non-readers alike.  No one has been disappointed.  Read this book yesterday!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've heard of this book for a while now but it was knowing that a movie would be coming out this year that finally got me to read it and a week later I finished one incredible book. If your a fan of sci-fi this is a must read. I'm also very excited to see the movie featuring Harrison Ford.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Here is the &#34;American Bandstand&#34; answer, It was very funny and I enjoyed it. I was especially surprised with the heartwarming ending.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I'm slightly addicted although I'm not that great at it! I wish I could figure out how to get more diamonds!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I missed the first 2 shows of this season and had to catch up.  This show takes you by surprise when you first start watching
B004R13U6Y|4.0|This app worked well for my Fire. Allowed me to download pdf of school lecture power-points and then make notes and highlight on the pfd. The easiest way to get pdf on the device is to you dropbox.com . It takes a while to figure out to navigate the options which alot of reviewers complained about but if you use your brain you can figure it out. (This is an android device not a toddler easy Ipad app)
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|It is really great when you go in your friends' house and you show your phone pictures and videos directly on their TV screen. No cabling, no preparation, no setup ... just WOW of your friends.
B00008O89K|5.0|hubby loves this cd he had to download it to his phone, and now i get to listen to it...so thrilled about that....
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|My least favorite book of the trilogy. I could have done without this one. Just like a fire, the trilogy started strong, but quickly burnt out.
B003CYKCHW|5.0|The mouse still works great. NEVER broken down on me yet. One of the concerns about mad katz products are reliability, and I am very surprised how well the mouse performs.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I love this movie the special effects the action scenes and not to mention the great acting of Heath ledger. Great additional to my DVD collection
B000VEA38E|5.0|these cds bring you back to the movies itself the cantenna and the firefight.....they were worth the money and the wait...great
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This was a pretty good movie that both my son and mom and dad enjoyed. It is a movie I would watch again.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|This CD is great the whole way through it still has their sound, but with a darker feel to it. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes their old albums or any other electronica music.
B0038P59A0|4.0|It was a good movie Robert downstairs Jr is a great actorhe really has came a long way.this move made a great addition to my DVD collection
B007MDB6L0|5.0|thank you for a lovely item, it was enjoyed by all the family, keep up the good work, will by again
B004S26HB2|4.0|I heard from it in a twit from a Linux forum and I read and found it very interesting mixture of marketing associated to the IT.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I did not expect to like this movie, but it is one of the few that gets me laughing even though I've seen it 20 times. It has tons of rude humor, but it is so funny anyway that it is one of the few dvds I bought. Super fun movie!
0399157565|1.0|Or should I say Patricia?<br />I threw the book in the trash can after 200 pages. I have never been so dissapointed in a book. I had read a couple of books featuring the strong and powefull Kay Scarpetta, just to find out that the Scarpetta in this book is a slow, easy intimadet, insecure and very back beat kinda person. The court scene when she get chewed out by a defense lawyer and judge almost paifully unrealistic and out of character. Followed by an intervention of her own lab when she returns.. And what does she do....NOTHING, she just stands there like a twelve year old girl, kinda mad, but no What the hell are you doing in my lab??????<br />Maybe it's time for Cornwell to reinvent her writing. She knows her forencic stuff, but it gets to detailed, too many abbreviations and too boring!!
B002LW9ITY|5.0|Of course the Cars movie is great, but this combo pack with the blu-ray DVD and the cars is extra great!  The cars are good quality and have held up for some time.  My son loves to play with them while watching the movie.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|i bought this as a gift for my daughter,she loves the series. my wife has seen most of season 7 and says it is as good as the first 6 seasons. I would recommend this 7th seaon to fans of the series.
B003XYERRM|5.0|Sharon Penman writes in such a way as to take the reader into the action without being trite.  I have read all of the Plantagenet series and loved every one of the books.  This has proven to be no exception.  For historical fiction buffs, this is a must.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I wish there were more Seasons to come...........I really miss watching the Desperate Housewives series....wish there were more to come!!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Lots of fun - it's challenging, but still fun. I like how it's a combination of outer space and earthly stuff.
B009CPES4I|4.0|This British movie is an enjoyable watch. Great moments and plenty of character portraits. Nice for us old retired folks...enjoy!
B008VBYN80|5.0|You know you cant really complain when somethings free. But with this game it's over the top. Kinds of like a civilization game but be wary don't get tricked into buying diamonds.
B005H29GSI|4.0|It was an okay game for the price. The kids liked it. It was donated to a school and used during &#34;indoor recess&#34;
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds Rio is very fun. It looks just like the movie and it's like making a tropical escape :)
B008CPBB0I|3.0|The movie has some funny moments...not great but watchable. I like to see the big whales up close and for this reason it is worth it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this. I am thinking more about my daily basis and how to improve. A very thought provoking book. I will be recommending this to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was a good read and I can't wait to see what happens next in this deep dark little story line.
B008M87GJK|4.0|Good way to get access to current events, although it wasn't updated that much. I kept seeing the same stories all the time.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Did these out of order. did rio after space.  Ooops.<br />fun tho, distracts from life for a momemt.<br />Thanks Barbara
B005HSGB6W|4.0|The best part of this book was the \\"nadsat\\" speech that the author created, mostly from Russian, for the book. Learning all the words as they were carefully placed so they could be understood first from context was pretty entertaining. Overall, a real horrorshow raskazz.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have love reading all the Game of Thrones books - the 4th book is a bit confusing in the early part, because several new players emerge that were barely present in the first three books...hang in there; it seems to sort itself out - at least so far...
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|It is a fun game, but more challenging than I'd like, and I saw very few instructions on how to play.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|This is a great set. Led Zep is fantastic, especially with Jason Bonham's drumming. I didn't give it 5 stars because Robert Plants vocals weren't 100%. I guess he's getting old.<br />The DVD is very good. If you have a good sound system then you'll have great time watching it.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|A nice stocking stuffer for my wife. I even liked several of the songs and I'm into 60's and 70 music.
0805091742|5.0|Atul Gawande is a superior writer - this book is a must for all of us in healthcare, and any industry that seeks to decrease variation and raise level of care/service
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Challenging, but also a lot of fun. I like how it combines outer space scenery with stuff on our planet.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Product was just as it was stated in detail, was in perfect condition!  Good job!  Keep up the good work!
0553573411|5.0|The Farseer Trilogy, I haven't enjoyed a series this much since The Game of Thrones. Totally different writing, but I love Robin Hobbs and will continue to read her books. Fitz is a wonderful character...great story.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|3+ Characters with issues who all get a happy ending in a book where the lead does not believe in happy endings not for a mature reader who wants well rounded characters.
B009D0KER2|3.0|Nice dictionary, but I couldn't access it without the Internet. Also it didn't have as many colloquialisms as other dictionaries.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Product was just as it was stated in detail, was in perfect condition!  Good job!  Keep up the good work!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|At first you might think that it is boring but after you have enough coins to buy some things you will not stop playing!!! TIPPS you always want to check your missions!!!
B009MFKO3M|4.0|Lonerism is a great album to put on in almost any case. Feels Like We Only Go backwards is an incredibly good song.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|I ordered this, and other pieces on behalf of my in-laws for my son's Christmas present. It just so happened that I had ordered a Lego idea book for him, so the combination was perfect! He has already built a few things. I need to complement the set with something with wheels.
B0054SMID0|4.0|That was one good movie. I liked it a lot. But be awake. It's quick. Pay attention. Matthew McConaughey is a really good actor. I liked a lot of the characters, and the acting and story were well done.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|You need to buy this book! This is so Portable. Once I got this book on my kindle fire my eyes were glued to this book!!! YOU ARE NOT WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have insomnia and so I battle each night trying to get some sleep. Even meds don't always help. I saw this app and thought I'd give the free mini version a shot. WOW. I am in love with this thing. I can't wait to buy the full version. I like to make it sound like a nice rain storm since I can sleep through hurricanes and yes I have slept through Charlie here in Florida. Suckers give me migraines too so this way I get some help sleeping WITHOUT the migraines. I am so glad some one made this. Even my mom wants this app. Thank you!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarms sounds...my fav, so far, is 'Heaven'.  I also really like how the alarm starts off softly and then gets louder if you ignore it.  I really love the fact that I'm not being  'scared awake' by the very annoying 'beep beep' of my old electric alarm clock anymore.  My only problem with this app, is I'm still trying to figure out how to permanently delete old alarm times that I don't need any longer...they still go off if I forget to manually check the alarm times before I go to sleep each night.  I used the 'help' feature', but no luck finding a fix for this problem so far.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Makes you feel inspired and invincible. I could not put it down. I would recommend to runners and non runners alike.
1596680296|5.0|I bought this book when i first set out to learn how to knit socks. Three years or more later I'm still using it and find it lovely and flexible. it has basic sock patterns for different gauges and it also has patterns for knee-high socks (that I've made several times to give as gifts) and nice patterns for socks for men that my BF loves.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I thought my Wi-Fi signal was week because my netbook is so slow. When I got my Kindle Fire I downloaded Wi-Fi Analyzer and found out my Wi-Fi signal was at the top of the scale. I think I need a new netbook.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|Im not sure what other people are complaining about. NO it isnt the best bool ever written and yes grammer(spelling?) and style arent what i could call popular or modern. Thats what i enjoy about this book, its kind of raw unpolished feel. It reads directly to the crowd who has grown up with these books and characters. The 13-16 year old who read Twilight and subsequently read the next three books got older and more mature and so dod the books. The subject matter was more mature(parenthood,marriage,sacrifice for your children) as the reader had undoubtedly matured also. I give it 4 stars for knowing the reader and growing with them.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Like watching certain videos on Youtube, but you device uses a small Data plan or your device has no way of connecting unless you have Wifi? Well this app is for you. Use this app to download your favorite videos from Youtube and watch them on your device. Sometimes you may have trouble finding a specific video but it wasn't much trouble.
1883217040|5.0|This is a very detailed book, but with careful reading can reward the beginning, intermediate, or advanced wind jazz player.  Really helps in conjunction with a jazz class at the local college.  GJ
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|An absolutely beautiful and gut wrenching book. I read it in less than a day. Highly recommend. It's just... Wow.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|this is one of my old time favorites, along with Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments and so on, I will recommended it for those who follow Christianity History, with all the betray and greed around Roman people.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Do you remember the classic Space Invaders, Galaga, and Asteroids? Well if you are a fan of these games then you will love Radiant HD. At first glance it looks like a regular space shooter, but there is more to this then meets the eyes. First of all you will notice that there is dialog between characters that were never present in the originals between your character, your commanding officer, and the alien force. Second the ship is upgradeable with different weapons that you can alternate during the battle. Last it's extremely challenging since the aliens have blended tactics from all the classic space shooters. This is a must get for 8 bit fans, space shooter fans, and for people who like games in general.
B000FZETKC|5.0|This movie has almost the same exact plot as pretty in pink. It was pretty good. Really cute. The ending is pretty obvious but that's what makes an 80's movie an 80's movie
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am still floored by how amazing this book is.  Star is so easy to like and Dean is the bad boy you're dying to figure out.  A must read but have some tissues available.
098478280X|5.0|awesome book! highly recommended!<br />I use this book all the time! you should have one in your shell for sure.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Most puzzle games are just an everlasting run, but this one has a fun story where you are gathering pieces of a lost treasure.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show will suck you in the moment you start watching. We can't get enough and can't wait for the next season on Prime!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed Hopeless.  I was a little unsure since it was involving teenagers and I'm not overly excited about reading about going back to highschool.  However, it really stepped it up.  It was emotional, suspensful and beautiful.  I would recommend it.
B000002LMM|5.0|It's very seldom that soundtrack music (short of a concert film) is such a part of the viewing experience but the collaboration between David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti was (is) a match made in some strange and slightly twisted version of heaven. Moody and haunting, it's an enjoyable and involving listen...almost Eno-esque. It's like the matching disc to Julee Cruise's &#34;Floating Into The Night&#34; which of course shares some tracks.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|my favorite so far. has added some interesting new  possibilities and this book didn t feel like just a lead in for the next
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I've played this game for so long, it's difficult but not the end of the world if you lose either. Literally. Best dollar ever.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's awesome. It 's like you have your own horse. I  there was more appearances for you as the rider and I wish it had real horse breeds, with info and I wish you could travel to other places.
B003L77G06|5.0|It's a hysterical show, so happy I purchased this one.  Lots of laughs and great storylines, highly recommended to comedy fans.
B0013O123Q|1.0|I am sure this movie is very \\"artsy\\". I am just not able to comprehend its greatness.<br />It is very hard to tell what is going on because of the spastic camera, spinning and focusing on the ceiling, then the floor, then the actor (almost) then the wall, etc. ad nauseam. Maybe this is a good film but I couldn't tell you because the camera work makes it incomprehensible. The spinning camera trick does mostly stop after 1/2 hour, but I decided at that point if I should watch the rest of the movie. It is full of allot of nauseating violence and gay sex. I couldn't see wasting more time on it, so I stopped watching.
0316067598|5.0|This true story about our USA Warriors was very gripping. As you read along your heart pounds when you try to put yourself in their shoes. I could not put the book down and it's amazing because I knew and followed the event back when it unfolded. So I knew the outcome and still I was glued to the book. A must read for anyone that enjoys reading the day and life of true American Heroes. 5 STARS
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Love this app. Nice night light too. I love the sound options also,not many alarm clocks have such a variety.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|I only recently got into this show (now on it's fourth season) and I am so happy that I did.  It's absolutely hysterical and I highly recommend it to fans of comedy TV.
B004UB9SKS|4.0|I used this app on my Kindle Fire while traveling in Japan and South Korea. It does NOT require internet to operate, but in order to operate you need to download the languages you think you might need in your travels (which does require internet). I used hotel-room wifi (which isn't very fast) but still downloaded both languages in under 5 minutes to my Kindle. When I was out in Seoul or Tokyo I had all the downloaded phrases ready to use.<br /><br />A reminder: this is a phrase guide. If you're looking for a robotic translator that speaks your order in a resturant you need to invent your own app. While traveling I reccomend you use these apps to commit a few phrases to memory; that's all you need. There are business phrases, introductory phrases, and transportation phrases. Be a good guest in a foreign nation and try to use these apps to learn a bit of the local tounge! Too often people get these apps expecting them to be able to TRANSLATE. This is a useful tool if you use it correctly.<br /><br />I will continue to use this product wherever my next travels take me. The phrase-speaker voice has great pronunciation. I reccomend this for anyone who might find themselves somewhere they don't speak the language.
B0058SNI94|5.0|I wanted something for around the house to give my back some relief from our tile floors and these shoes have surpassed my expectations.  They are cute and comfy and I have been wearing them everywhere, with shorts and skirts, and with socks and jeans.  My husband said he likes them because he can hear me coming down the hall now since they aren't quite as stealth as my slippers.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We got this movie for our daughter who is 6yrs old & our 11yr old son. We all ended up watching it (Dad, Mom & kids) and really enjoying it. We were actually paying attention and watching the movie. It was cute and pretty funny there was some good humor in it.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Loved it you got to pick this up trust me you won't put it down. Batman got vicious when he couldn't take it anymore.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Good movie. No end of the world as we know it.<br />Good music and singers.<br />Would recommend it.<br />I plan on watching it again.
B009NOVCU6|5.0|This was a gift to a very special person who  thought it would be a CD only. Great surprise and much happiness.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was looking for something to read and saw reviews and others had put on FB it was a good read.  Started it on Friday night and by Saturday I was done.  I laughed, cried and was so surprised by the ending. Did not want it the book to end.  You have got to read this book if you don't read anything else get this book !!!!
1476712042|5.0|I have read this book already 3 times, and I'm sure I will read it again.  From start to finish it is well wrote out.  I'm sure \\"Walking Disaster\\" will be the same if not better!  Great read
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Updated 8-2-13<br />I and my wife have had this for nearly a year.  Still works wonders for the battery but the alarm volume indicating full charge has gone way low and now I can't hear it from another room.  Anyone have a fix?  Comment me.  Still give it 5 stars.  If this software is killing your battery during the night, you're doing something wrong.  If you paid for it, it may be going into \\"trickle\\" mode which is better for the life and strength of the battery in the long run.  You needn't use trickle mode every time you charge.  Look into the preferences and check on this issue instead of writing bad reviews.<br /><br />Initial review:  I have a SAMSUNG (Galaxy) Exhibit 2 4G [SGH-T679]  This freebee works great and doubled my battery life!  I think the main feature which saved me juice is I was able to turn off Data transfer etc.  The alarm works great.  No more having to check my phone to see if charging is complete since my phone only used to vibrate when fully charged.  Dumb!  I love the digital percentage display as well.  No more having to go into the phone to see how much power I have left.  People complaining about the color baffle me.  It's only a tiny icon at the top of the phone.  I've been running this for a few weeks and installed it on my wife's phone too.  I should note that we do not have a data plan and we seldom go on wifi nevertheless, my wife was having to charge her phone every day and sometimes hadn't even made a phone call.  It is left on standby and she uses it as an alarm clock as well.<br /><br />Talk about immature technology.  The batteries on these phones are SOOOO inadequate it's criminal.  Five stars because Battery Doctor did what I needed it to do and you can't beat the price!
0385344228|5.0|This book was fantastic! Once into it I couldn't put it down. The end left me sitting there thinking,  &#34;Wow! hat just happened!&#34;
0425252868|5.0|The photo section was more than a filler in the middle of the book. It allowed the reader to put a face with each of the individuals. It made the story more personal. I would definitely recommend this book
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This is the best music app. Requires Internet.has many artists like rihanna eminem jay z. Not really any rock bands
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a fun game and it loads very quickly. No wireless internet connection needed. It gets your brain flowing in the morning! ;D. This app os worth the download!!:)
B009LDXQGW|5.0|From Dangelo to Devante Swing. Its been a long wait for some REAL R&B! The Weeknds album is like the metaphors of his own lyrics, addictive and sexy. Saying he is talented is an understatement.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great a little short and finished reading it in about three hours. I did enjoy it very much. Not bad
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am anxiously awaiting another book! I had a hard time putting this book down for a minute. Truly enjoy this entire series!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This film was wonderful!  Very well produced.  A family friendly adventure that kept everyone entertained.  Cant wait for the sequel!
B002OOG6YY|5.0|I'll start by saying that I'm a huge Manson fan and have been since around the mid 90's. I've seen them live several times in that time span. I've had the DVD with the same title for awhile and assumed this was the same but on Blu-ray, not the case at all. It's a live show from start to finish! Nothing is as good as the real live experience but this is as close as it gets. Definitely my favorite Blu-ray I've bought so far, it looks sooooooooooooooooo good.<br /><br />  -MUST HAVE FOR ANY MANSON FAN-
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I thought that this book was very well written and very successfully tackled a difficult topic, teen suicide. However I though  that it was very repetitive. There were 13 reasons why Hannah, the protagonist committed suicide and each reason was told in exactly the same manner. In the end I was almost begging for the author to end the book. However I like the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a game that is fun for both kids and adults. There are many characters, power-ups and objectives to unlock. It is very simple and easy to learn. I recommend this be one of the first games you buy on your device. Temlpe Run is worth every penny...WARNING: once you start playing, you can't stop :) :) :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was surprised by this app... its really a fun app. I played tor hours the first time I played.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|After seeing the Jack Reacher movie over Christmas, I ordered up the first book in Lee Child' series and finished it in one day. Couldn't put it down. I enjoy action/adventure movies and books and looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Rumor has it that Tom Cruises' production company has purchased the licensing rights for all of the Jack Reacher series. Birth of the American version of James Bond?
B004X75RCW|4.0|Was just looking for a good stay-home date movie...  picked this one out of a lineup since Sandra Bullock movies generally don't get too dicey for my taste.  Really cute premise, and interesting character development seeing her conscience begin to work as her character responded to the kindnesses she was shown.  Always like to see something positive come out of negative situations.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i really could play all day<br />I wish it didn't take so long to get gems and gold. I want a unicorn and an appaloosa! !
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Made good use of my AMC pass on Sunday and went to see the movie: \\"Life of Pi.\\" This is an intense movie no question about it. Half the time I kept wondering 1. if it was possible to survive a shipwreck (Elian Gonzalez) and 2. Life with a tiger on a lifeboat (?) and what would I have done in such a situation.<br />To me this movie was a mix between \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" meets \\"Castaways\\" (Tom Hanks) meets \\"Avatar\\", Hmmm. I was very pleased with the depiction of the Roman Catholic Church, it was complimentary for once...this time there were no demons, and Holy water didn't scald; there were no exorcisms or ugly gargoyles.-but a message of love and serenity  accepting the challenges of life with the help of Jesus the son of God. Beautiful.<br />The scenes involving the animals ( both before the shipwreck and after), were difficult to watch ( I closed my eyes) and yes I cringed with the scenes involving the Hyenna, but recovered because I was curious to see the rest. The Bengali tiger scenes were well done and I enjoyed the beauty of this animal. This savage beast was symbolic of our own human resilience, and I found found myself cheering for him to survive and felt sad for him, too...wow. the Bengali tiger reminded me of dog of mine, a Siberian Husky, who was alpha male, intelligent and very high maintenance.<br />I picked this movie over the others at the movie theater because of its length as well. At just a bit over 2 hours it was the right amount of time to sit for me. Still, I missed a bit at the end because I had to go to the ladies room. ( The movies are getting longer and longer nowadays and I prefer to sit for a play if it's more than 2 1/2 hours with the luxury of a break for intermission.<br />The 3-D experience was new to me, I haven't been interested in anything 3-D before..the scene with the fish as if floating out out of the screen was awesome...and the glowing flower, wow I can't top that. I was removing my 3-D eyeglasses from time to time to see whether there was a marked difference....I can't say I will watch  it in 3-D again, but certainly will watch it over and over at home when it comes out on DVD or Blue Ray.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am not that big of a horse fan but even I love this game.It's fun for every age and always a lot you can do.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|These movies shipped fast and was very excited to see son in law open it, this is exactly what he wanted!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to use app. I like the audible voice for the reading. It has some expression.  It is easy to move around.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Wonderful graphics.  Excellent mix of problem solving memory and strategy hidden object.  Wish the story line has been a little more cohesive.
B0042816YK|5.0|Julia Roberts is in it.  Bought it for that reason alone and ended up being one of the lovliest movies!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|really great game that makes you think your feet. would love to see more like this one. great. game.<br />good job
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This last book of the trilogy was mediocre compared to the first two books.  The honeymoon may have been the reason. I did not like all the back flashes.  And the ending ended to sweet and sticky.  I mean even though they had kids was their  sex life to vanilla to mention? Sorry but that's the reason I bought the trilogy.
0143118706|5.0|If you enjoyed Eat Pray Love book or movie this is the sequel to it.  I was dying to know what happened &#34;after&#34; in the original so it was great to find this online at Amazon as I didn't even know it existed!!!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love all the Shopaholic series and the various other books by Sophie. This book is an enjoyable funny read. I definitely recommend!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found this book easy to understand and implement.  It and its companion book helped me to get started publishing.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Jack Reacher novels are like McDonalds hamburgers - they aren't the best around, but they are a consistently yummy indulgence.
B0044WUQ3G|5.0|This is a low budget movie but the plot is fresh and original. It's suspenseful and definitely something that can really happen.
B004ZA9HB4|2.0|It's a really cool idea. The app is nicely built and sending it to the tv was really simple. The only problem is just that all of the videos are those crappy web clips that nobody wants to watch. Some of them weren't even videos, they were podcasts with pictures. Don't get excited when you see Discovery Channel, FoxNews, etc. It's not like it will have MythBusters or anything. They are like video pilots that weren't quite good enough to actually air.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This may not be the longest book you sit down and read, however it is a great book to read. I wasn't sure how much I would like the book when I started, and then promptly finished it in one sitting. Greatly story telling and writing by Stephen Chbosky, I cannot wait for his next work!
B005HSL626|5.0|ti's game is awesome want to play it over and over again I feel like I am ti ninja ok
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I dig it! I love all the G5 games. Graphics are great, it gets harder as you go on, and always finds new and original ways to keep your interest so you don't want to put it down until you reach the end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Was a wonderful page turner. Couldn't put it down. Very well written. Cannot wait to read the next book. Great writting.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I can't stop watching this blu-ray.  One of my favorite movies right now.  I'm so happy that I bought it.
B0043UB0BQ|5.0|No wonder this series is so popular. I bought it since I watched season 2 and wanted to find out what led up to the revolt. Can't wait for War of the Damned.
B0059DL0UC|5.0|Excellent description and application to the exercises.  It brought it all together for me. I am glad I purchased it after a recommendation from a friend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Pretty packed with action, survival, and suspense. I`d recommend this book once you get passed the prepping of the tributes.
B000FC1GJW|5.0|This was a good book. You must have an open mind to read it I think. The author did well in writing it.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|All I really have to say is that I much prefer the movie to the book.  Book was ok, but movie had a much happier feel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was so wrapped up in the story it was done in a day! An Amazing plot and vivid characters.<br />lord of the flies meets the future with underlying ethical questions that stirr ones mind.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|LIke having access while on the go.  Use google maps often and being able to look up things on the internet.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This was a great movie.  Gory but aesthetically pleasing (with some very nice &#34;slow-mo&#34; scenes), this movie did what Stallone's version could not pull off.  It showed the dystopic world of Dredd unfiltered and Urban's portrayal of Dredd was spot on.  Surprise performance by the female leads (the bad guy and the newbie judge) just put the cherry on top of the already perfect pie.  Watch it people!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesomely awesome. I had pc 1, it died got a kindle found this downloaded and I was so happy. Worth the $$.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Love having access while on the go.  Often visit site while on vacation.  Like being able to check out while on the go.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I have been using this program for several weeks now and love being able to show and work out problems with my 2 kids and their math problems!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Not much fun or challenging.  Do not hold interest for very long.  Do not visit often.  Not exactly for me.
B007WV05GY|1.0|What a gripping film about man's desire to survive and his acceptance of death.  I've watched this dvd 3 times and still  find more to think about each time.  Scenery is beautiful and the wolf robots are amazingly real.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This game is good for beginners to mahjong.  I like something with more of a challenge.  I would recommend it highly to new players
0061743526|5.0|I love this book. I really wanted it in hardcover. I had to have it. We are losing everything to electronics. I love my library full of real books that can be held. Love to cuddle in a comfortable chair, reading a book under my tiffany lamps on a rainy day.I wish it came leather bound.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game has many levels and I like the idea of the different types of games. I would recommend this to  players that have been doing it for awhile.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We need a new series on TV written and performed today as good as this one.  This was a request from my son, and I was happy to purchase it for him.

B006FE83UE|5.0|Waited for this to come out. I bought 2 copies. One as a Christmas present.  Great movie. Great acting. This is done really well. So much feeling out of the actors.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I did not want to put this down and stop reading. Suspenseful and romantic. A very good read well worth your time.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|It was awesome . I liked when Roderick got first place in the science fair and his show in the talent show.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|It's a challenge to write about &#34;everyday life&#34; in a way that grips the reader. Franzen does it..without a doubt.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|I expected some child savvy game but it was not that bad. Pretty good graphics, nice idea,  and I enjoyed it...
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Bought this book after watching Jack Reacher movie thought I would start with the first book. Very slow hard to get into author uses very short non-descriptive sentences. Maybe the other books get better but I will not waste another nine bucks to find out.<br />Jeff Sanford is a much better author if your like crime books.<br />SO IN CONCLUSION MOVIE GOOD, BOOK BAD
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Had no idea what to expect!  This was a very disturbing book!  Not sure if<br />I will continue with the Trilogy!!!
0307744434|5.0|Erin Morgenstern has written a magnificent tale in The Night Circus. It is hard to find the words to describe my love for this books, but I will try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed about this book is the richness of it. The descriptions are so detailed and vivid. I could imagine myself walking through each tent and experiencing the magic. I feel privileged that Ms. Morgenstern let us inside her amazing imagination.<br /><br />The circus is its own character. Each individual tent has its own distinct personality. The use of black and white did not give the circus a sinister feel. Instead, the colors, or lack thereof, make it whimsical and magical. I usually don't like circuses but the The Cirque des Reves would be a beautiful sight to behold.<br /><br />At the heart of the book is Celia and Marco and what I call their diabolical competition. Two men steal their lives for a competition that no one really wins. Hector, in particular, is obsessed with the game. He doesn't care who he hurts, including his daughter, in order to win. While Alexander does show some pity Marco at times, he is still cold and indifferent. It is heartbreaking. Celia and Marco's love story evolves slowly over time. Each creation in the circus is made with love for each other. Deep down, it is a true Romeo and Juliet story.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Ms. Morgenstern's view of magic. The illusions are beautifully described. There are no witches or wizards, only amazing illusionists who can manipulate people and objects around them. I found this be very intriguing and kept me engrossed in the book.<br /><br />The Night Circus is amazing book. I highly recommend it to anyone that loves the circus, or even if you don't, and beautiful love story.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Great book. From start to finish this story keeps your attention and interest. Some of Vince's recent books have not been the page turners of old, but The Last Man brings Vince back to his earlier novels.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I  recall watching the version with Arnold, this version was boring and put me to sleep. would not watch again.
0679416781|5.0|I just reread The English Patient for the second time after many many years and it still breaks my heart and it remains for me one of the most beautifully written books of modern times.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This Is A Fun Game, And I Play When I Have Time. I Would Advise Anyone That Likes This Type Of Game To Download It.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|You do not know where the story will take you, but sense that it will be exciting and unexpected. The novelty of the winding story telling feels like the haphazard straw walk way of a fair at night. The characters are each their own fascinating spectacle, like oddity booths in a carnival. You can't tell how any two things fit together as you wounded through, but you leave with a feeling that you've have a delicious, but exotic agradulce treat.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Great gift.  Item not easy to find anymore.  It is being treasuered and played often.  Thanks for making me a Hero gift giver.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great for all ages and it is so fun my horse is beatiful. I hope everyone loves it like me have fun.

B00005B4GU|3.0|Ever since OK Computer, Radiohead's detractors have often accused the band of unsubstantial artfulness over virtuous instrumentation (a.k.a. they don't rock hard enough). In an argument, if those accusations were to be exemplified, Amnesiac would be the first and foremost evidence of such claims; it's an album that literally doesn't rock but in one track (Knives Out). Now for a rock band that has 3 of the best guitarist that their genre has to offer this might seem like a capital sin, yet just until now it was a tendency in Radiohead's music that's been rightly justified due to the band's impeccable songwriting and production skills, which has smoothly transitioned their genre barriers onto equally worthy forays into indie electronic and art rock. This is not the case for Amnesiac however, which tracks were recorded at the same time as the sessions that ended up in Kid A.<br /><br />Essentially, Amnesiac is for all intents and purposes entirely constructed of watered-down leftovers that do not match the lyrical prowess and cohesiveness of its predecessor. The songs, while not necessarily in discordance with one another, are only loosely tied together by the atmospheric drones of the album's production and ever so slightly by their thematic idiosyncrasies (which are also not as comprehensible as in Kid A). Two-Thirds of the songs present on the album are indie-electronic pieces, while the rest are experimental songs of several sources (plus the aforementioned Knives Out). While the songs are not structurally cohesive between one another, the most flattering quality about the album is its variety on form and technique, excelling in constant switches in the production's approach; sound collages, thin drum machines, pulsating drones, noise samples and several variations of vocal processing are just a few examples present and most of those techniques are not recycled past the single song, yet it's in its lyrical execution and organisation that the material weakens beyondrecognition.<br /><br />It could be ultimately argued that Amnesiac's bleak atmosphere and rambunctious song organisation are a thematic statement of the album's title, but given the nature of its tracks' origins among other markers, it's obvious that its aspirations are more of a convenience to paste together an otherwise non-existing project, rather than a truly conceptual work of art.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easy to use  and loaded with tones, has a great UI, I use it to manage my appointmens and social activities
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was incredible and kept me on my toes. I had to spend the majority of my weekend either reading it or watching the trailer for the movie over and over again!

B00886XQO0|1.0|In the past seven years, across the two Xbox 360 consoles I've owned, I've only used one wireless headset to communicate on Xbox Live: the original [[ASIN:B000HZFCZQ Xbox 360 Wireless Headset Communicator]]. It did what I needed it to do: properly communicate with my friends over Xbox. While my headset has gone through hell and back in the past seven years, I decided it was time to upgrade. After reading reviews all across Amazon, Best Buy, and various other online stores, the choice was clear. The Turtle Beach Call of Duty: Black Ops II Tango headset was going to give me the best bang for my buck. Instead of purchasing with my Amazon Prime account, I opted to go with Best Buy where it came out to $184.99 after Reward Zone certificates I had saved up.<br /><br />Now this is not my first foray into gaming headsets. On my desktop computers, I've been using the [[ASIN:B003VANOFY Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound]] since they first came onto the market. For gaming, the Logitech G930 has been an amazing experience. While I've never played a game that has utilized all of the channels that 7.1 surround sound has to offer, the headset has consistently provided crystal clear audio quality when it comes to gaming and voice communication. I was hoping for a similar, if not superior, experience. Especially based upon the fact that Turtle Beach has set an MSRP of $299.99 for the Tango.<br /><br />It's clear as day that Microsoft's Xbox 360 was never meant to utilize wireless audio as all the wireless headsets on the market utilize an RF transmitter. To be fair, the setup of the RF transmitter and setting up the audio settings was fairly simple and took no more than a few minutes. After setting up my Xbox to get ready for what I was hoping would be the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of an audio gaming experience, I went onto my computer to make sure the headphone's firmware and presets were up to date. In the past year and a half, I've been the proud owner of a maxed out 27\\" quad-core i7 Apple iMac. Obviously, I've been playing most of my games via Apple's Boot Camp software. Turtle Beach proudly markets inside the instruction booklet that there's a Mac OS X version of their Advanced Sound Editor software. That's not the case. In fact, it's an extremely bare-bones, stripped-down version of their Advanced Sound Editor software. You have the options to update and reset the firmware and select your presets. If you actually want to go into the equalizer settings, you'll need a Boot Camp partition or a Windows computer. You think Turtle Beach, a company that provides a premiere audio experience for gaming consoles, would provide fully functional software for a premiere computing experience. This is not the case. Once I made sure my firmware and presets were good to go, it was time to test the bad boys out on the game these were made for: Black Ops II.<br /><br />After a few hours of testing, I had enough and promptly put the headphones back in the box to return to Best Buy.<br /><br />For a 5.1 system, the Tango's audio experience was flat out garbage. I'm not an audiophile by any means of the imagination, but compared to my surround sound system in my living room or my Logitech G930 headset, the sound produced by the Tango was highly inferior. Everything sounded extremely compressed and tinny. It felt as if the Xbox, the RF transmitter, and-or the headset itself was compressing the 5.1 mix produced by the game down to a 64 kbps MP3 file. For a headset that retails three-hundred dollars, I shouldn't hear any sort of static. However, here I was getting an inadequate experience. I kept on going back to my computer to adjust the presets and equalizer settings, but nothing helped. I also heard complaints from my friends that my voice sounded distorted over the microphone despite my numerous attempts at re-adjustment. At the end of the night, once I switched back to the Microsoft headset, my friends were surprised by thequality provided by Microsoft's over Turtle Beach's.<br /><br />To make sure it wasn't my imagination and this headset truly sucked, I paired the headphones up via Bluetooth on my iMac and compared them to my G930 using Team Fortress 2 and iTunes. The difference in audio quality was night and day. The G930 was always on point whereas the Tango was more static than everything else. I've used numerous Bluetooth stereo headphones before, but they were all light years ahead of the Tango despite all being at a significantly cheaper price point.<br /><br />This is the best Turtle Beach headset on the market? If this is the best the company has to offer, I'm never buying a product of theirs again. You're better off putting two tin cans together by string, putting one next to your television's speaker, and the other to your ear. For $300, the Tango is a rip-off. I get that Microsoft dropped the ball on providing a seamless wireless audio experience with the Xbox 360 unlike that of a PS3 or a PC, but not enough to drop triple digits on a headset that'll continue to provide inferior audio quality. I hope that Microsoft puts Bluetooth 4.0 or audio out via USB into the next-generation Xbox and we can see some truly great wireless headsets come out. Until then, I'll stick with my original wireless headset until they decide they've had enough time in this world.ided by Microsoft's over Turtle Beach's.<br /><br />To make sure it wasn't my imagination and this headset truly sucked, I paired the headphones up via Bluetooth on my iMac and compared them to my G930 using Team Fortress 2 and iTunes.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Heart warming and a tear jerker at the same time as it explores aging and retirement, loneliness, death, joy, new beginnings.  Not entirely predictable.  A few good twists.  Good story lines.  Great acting.  Came away with optimism.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Incredible book!  I wasn't looking for a lesson in science, history or Mormonism.  I just like to read and appreciate a good book.  This book was a non-stop, action packed, lesson filled page tuner.  Best $2 you'll spend!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved Tom Hardy's character!  Very different from other roles I have seen him in.  Shia continues to impress me with his films.
B00AUN2HO4|4.0|Advertised as a \\"Special Extended Version.\\" Didn't see anything special or extended. Still...it's Harry Potter. It's always good to go back to the beginning.
1878424777|5.0|These 4 agreements as explained by Don Miguel Ruiz are profoundly basic (like air) and make so much sense. The words are direct brought with love and care.  If you are ready to wake up, take responsibility for your life, and surrender to the joy of be-ing this book/CD is a must.  The CD is great as it is narrated by Peter Coyote whose voice carries the message very well.
B0010R3VNK|5.0|I love this album, it is playable through my record player. incredibly affordable price, could have hustled me on this album.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Was never a reall Taylor Swift fan but after reading many positive reviews by people in the business, I gave it a try and I am very impressed.  She's a great story teller and her words, melodies and production are truly inspiring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Probably the best show I've ever watched...and I don't feel bad about it because it's not full of trash and inappropriate content. Finally a wholesome and good show.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|Like most sequels, this lost some of its pizzazz in the final book. Still, it was good just not quite cutting it like the first book....
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very enlightening.I enjoyed reading how a highly intelligent man that was not sure he believed God; beliefs changed after<br />a NDE.  This confirms there is a heaven.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I love human interest stories like this, especially the ones that take place during times that truly try men's souls.  The author made me feel like I was really there with both of these men through their training and their trials over the war-torn skies of Europe.  Such a heart warming ending (I won't spoil it for you), and I hated to see the story end.  If you love real life human interest stories, you'll love this one!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just not. Intensive but a good game for free. It's good for kids that need to get the idea of responsibility. Cool!
0307474259|5.0|I greatly appreciated the way he carefully sights research about so many of our stubborn myths and confusions about tood.  He makes sense, and is not just trying to sell us a diet.  The information that he gives is also a valuable resource.  For instance,, I was glad to have the explanation about cholesteral.  Doctors are always wanting me to take statins, but my HDL is high and I do not have to be so concerned about cholesterol.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent. Fast reading keep you wanting to know what happens. Enjoyed reading can't wait for the next book. Want to see peers and Latinas story continue
1936608898|4.0|I got quite inspired and informed by the information in the book.  However, I didn't want to do the 30 day program yet.  It is strict, and I only need to lose a about 2-5 pounds.

B0099116AY|5.0|My wife and I saw this movie when it was released and I bough the Blu-ray as a stocking stuffer for my.  It is a kind of reminder for us to keep things open and fresh between us.  At the time we went to the theater, we discovered we were facing some of the issues as the characters.  Great Movie!

B00ARAO0WM|2.0|Bad acting, bad plot... All in all weak... Waste of time.  I think my 4 year old could have developed a better story line.
B0095R76EW|5.0|great story, extended to areas unexpected. Not your average rom com, as would be expected from the directors history and the cast.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you enjoyed reading The Help, then this is certainly a Must to add to your book list.....There are many characters so &#34;be prepared&#34; but the feeling evoked from this Book are incredible...
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I was just a kid when Star Trek debuted in the fall of 1966. When I was just 7 years of age, the final episode aired in 1969. I still have a few warm and fuzzy memories of sitting in our living room, with my Banquet TV dinner and glass of ice tea, and watching this show on a big RCA black and white television. Even in black and white, the show had a magical quality that made it stand out from most other fare. I was certainly too young at the time to grasp all the sociopolitical undercurrents in the storyline, but I was perfectly happy to gaze at all the imaginary alien worlds and wonderful gizmos. And don't even get me started on all the pretty girls..Barbara Luna (&#34;Mirror, Mirror&#34;) and Marianna Hill (&#34;Dagger of the Mind&#34;)...yum, yum!<br /><br />Well, enough of the trip down memory lane. I sort of lost touch with Star Trek in the 70's, but watched the reruns whenever I could, although I never became a 'trekkie'. I liked the show, but not THAT much. Like many, my interest was renewed when the motion pictures began to revive the series with the first movie in 1979. CBS/Paramount has done a wonderful job of bringing the original TV show back to life with these remastered versions. Everything looks so crisp and clear. I know many die-hard Trek fans had issues with the digitally enhanced effects, but I thought they looked quite stunning....darn near cinema quality in some episodes. There is, however, an eerie sort of disconnect with this. You'll see the Enterprise, looking better than it ever looked when the show aired in the 60's, floating majestically in space, and then a switch inside to those same cheesy interior sets. There just wasn't much the special effects wizards could do with the rather Spartan corridors and control panels. That not withstanding, everything looks far, far better than it ever did when the show first aired. Especially the alien planets and landscapes. The show is more enjoyable to me now than it was years ago. Not because of Roddenberry's progressive political themes, but because it all looks so much better. My only gripe, and it's minor, is one pointed out by others...the sound at times seems a bit screwy. I don't have a fancy 'surround sound' system, just the speakers on the TV. The strange effect I speak of is especially noticeable in the very beginning of each episode...&#34;Space, the final frontier...&#34;, that famous prologue as spoken by Bill Shatner. But it sounds like he's in another room while the theme music nearly drowns him out. There's really no way to compensate for it unless you switch to mono. A simple 'stereo' setting would have been nice.<br /><br />The packaging is a bit heavy, with its awkward clam shell cases, but it seems sturdy and well made. All the DVD's have lots of extras, not just the actual episodes, so there's lots of material here to go through. I've only made it through the first season, and that took me all weekend! All things considered, this was a solid purchase and I'm quite pleased. This remastered boxed set should be an absolute must for all serious fans of the original Star Trek series.enberry's progressive political themes, but because it all looks so much better.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|My friend's twins loves Minecraft so I'm surprising them with this, they're going to love it. It looks pretty small but also cool. I'm so glad I was able to snatch one up.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Flawless on the Galaxy Note 2. lots of Templates and Backgrounds. One of the Best Mahjongs 4 Android so far!
0451418441|5.0|Very nice follow up to Pillars, excellent story line with extremely vivid descriptions of life during the period.  Definitely one of top 5 books I've read, Pillars being one of them also.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Very entertaining if you are looking for something to make you laugh.  Not a deep story but I wasn't expecting that when I bought it.  My teenagers have watched this movie several times and laugh everytime.  Great cast but Fat Amy steals the show several times!
B004WOH18E|4.0|From the outset, I must admit that I thoroughly enjoy Jeffrey Archer's books (bar one, namely First Among Equals which neither I, my son and two of my friends could &#34;get into&#34;). The story is easy to read, a real page-turner and naturally - in true Archer style - has a twist in the end. Well worth reading. I am only giving 4 stars because I do find some of his other books are better.
1594487154|5.0|I'm a fan of Pink's work. His First Movers marketing plan hooked me and he sold me this book pre-press. My husband has been in sales for 40 years - he loved this book as a fresh look at his career. It has new twists on persuading others to follow. Pink provides an insightful, clear, and a thoroughly enjoyable fresh look at what it means to Sell. I looked at his thesis from a higher education perspective and am impressed by how well it transfers to other work. The case study examples are relevant and clearly support his points.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First the 6 minute recap of Season 1&2 is great and funny because it covers the entire timeline in 6 minutes. For DA fans the romance of the era continues. It's just so luscious. Enjoy.
B007UK81FO|4.0|I anticipated a lot more information on the character history and back stories in general. This book was less content intense than the previous one but still interesting.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My son opened this pack first out of this and the extra sets of blocks. I got these for his birthday. He absolutely loves to build things and the first thing he built was an outhouse.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's good but it needs caves Redstone lava positions pressure plates the nether bigger world Npc villages other than that I love it
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a very interesting series.  I watched Season 1, loaned to me by a friend, in just a weekend.  I purchased the Season's Pass for season 2 and finished that in just a few days.  It is a great insight into the English class system of the early 1900s.  It ties in to historic events in a smooth manner.  Very, very interesting.  Once I buy Season 3, episode 1, I will be caught up with the over the air PBS broadcasts.<br /><br />The purchase from Amazon Instant Video was flawless.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|Jesus this game sucks I try to play multilayer and get bombarded by hackers people who warp have infinite health and somebody this game needs to get antihack protection until then one star and I'm done playing.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a great fast read! Very well written! I couldn't put it down! Sylvia Day wrote an excellent compelling story!
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Within 30 seconds I was watching YouTube videos on my TV controlled by this app on my tablet.  Fascinating.  App found the Xbox automatically no in pouts required.  I am writing this review while app is playing videos on TV.
B00102FELM|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite dvd concert from my collection.The scorpions deliver an amazing show. They really know how to work with the audience,something you don't see much of anymore. If your a scorpions fan you will love this dvd. Get this dvd concert!The video quality is very good . Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker on stage were great!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Was a wonderful twisting book with good action character and plot development. Was a great follow to the previous Jack Ryan novels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a first read by this author and it won't be my last! I just have to say this book totally blew me away. I'm not good at writing reviews but I felt like this book should be given five stars. It's a story of first's for many things for Skye and Holder and I would love to see a second book in this series. Skye has had a dark and emotional past that she has forgotten, she believes she is adopted as she was told by her adopted mother. She meets Holder at a coffee shop and their friendship begins and soon they become more than friends, it's Holder who brings up questions about Skye upbringing that led to her finally putting the pieces together. Take a chance on this book you will love it!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|We had tried coming in the middle of season a couple of years ago, didn't know the characters, the sub-plots, and found it too confusing.  With this purchase, we started at the beginning, watched 2 (and sometimes 3) episodes a night, and are obviously hooked.  Very glad to be able to follow season 3 on TV.  Casting, acting and story line are all good.  I would recommend.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|Maybe It's just me, maybe I was sappy today. My husband found me crying in the verandah. I was at 8%....<br />Did not take long for me to connect with Mia and her family!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I had to own this movie.  How on earth did they ever create such a realistic sci-fi film??  The special effects are stunning!!!!!!!!!!!  The extra bonus features are cool too.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I just used this app. I have it set so it will ask me 2 math questions just to hit snooze! Good job Angle Labs, good job. LOL
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I like it even though I not sure yet why some of the move take action, because Its different than when I play it with real cards. Need to study it more.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was useful and I would recommend this dictionary to others. I would still get the one that's been around longer also.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game.I find it very entertaining and amusing. I enjoy playing solitaire on or off the computer.
1401307787|5.0|I have purchased several of his books, and they have been invaluable in my search for peace within myself. This is one of the best
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Nice, easy, escape reading. A real enjoyable read! Once the holiday was over I needed a relaxing read that had very likeable characters.
B004L3AR0K|1.0|Half way through it skips constantly. Ended up taking about 3+ hours to watch the movie. Pretty miserable :( Which really sucks bc I looooove the movie and I was so excited to finally own it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I'm impressed. Good graphics and sounds. A bit glitchy at times and I did have to reinstall it once on my Kindlefire. It asked to reactivate my &quot;account&quot; which I agreed to. It reloaded everything so I was able to pick up where I left off so I was &quot;off and running again.&quot;
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have had a regular Yahoo! Mail account since 1995. I'm a big fan. However, the app has two basic roadblocks that stops me from using it; 1) This app doesn't have a way to &#34;check other mail&#34; so I can't get the mail sent to those accounts with my business address. I still have to use the 'classic' web access which makes the app at this point, useless for my purposes. 2) The most recent upgrades weren't tested well at all. Not my best experience with Yahoo! but I'll keep checking for improvements to this app.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is great. My daughter who is seven plays everyday. She reports the game changed for the Christmas holiday - and again shortly after. Fun addictive game.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I was worried that I wouldn't like this movie because I already liked the first one, but it held its own.  As somebody that  doesn't know (nor care about) the comic book history, I liked the combination of action, absurdity, characters, and insight (really) in the Stallone movie.  This new rendition skips the insight aspect, but counters with an atypically competent \\"rookie\\" (within the action film genre), and painting a grittier absurdity.  The look of the new flick also benefits from a decade plus advancement in movie effects.  The showcase of macabre deaths, though, was a turn off for me, but to each his own.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I  usually don't like teen romances, but this was a great read. I enjoyed it. It flowed very well, and it had a great story. My one negative remark about it is that you kind of feel let down at the end. I wanted a little more story about what happens to the other characters. I know the book isn't about them but I fell like I have been left hanging.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|It is obvious that a lot of thought went into the script and casting of this show. Has the ability to appeal to a wide audience. Tragic love story, bad boy with a soft heart, fall from grace, any one of these descriptions could fit as well as many more. Great story line for the man and woman of the house.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is a very  good read. I didn't want to set it down.From beginning to the end it kept my interest up.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Never knew where they were going to take it. Always left me on the edge of my seat and definitely cannot wait to watch Season 3! Always seemed to go where I thought it would, but in a different way. Very exciting season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ok this is an amazing game I love horses and I love this game so if you are looking for a great horse game or Eng good great amazing game this is defently it for SURE SO GET IT CUZ ITS EPIC that's it
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The 3D considering it wasn't filmed in true 3d is really well done. Absolutely the most entertaining movie of the year.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This makes teaching so much easier.  If I need it in a flash,  it's there!  It can help change the direction of a lesson in such a positive and efficient way.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|Great graphics and fun to play on the KindleFire. It's quite a unique game as well. Some of the levels seem impossible to complete, which is a bit frustrating. It takes some strategizing to complete many levels, which make this game kind of cool. It's fun enough to try for free, I'd say.
1457514508|4.0|When I saw the title of the book, I assumed that the \\"Club\\" would follow the familiar pattern and consist of some little old ladies and their pooches who solved mysteries that stumped the local police.  The 3 living members of the Club were actually part of the intrigue as well as every other character that set foot in the park where the dogs got their exercise.<br /><br />It took a little while to follow the flow of the book.  Any given chapter may have the same account told from the perspective of many characters.  Until you learned enough about the many characters, it was difficult.  But it was worth it when it all came together.  (Though I was constantly confusing the characters of Carla and Cindy)<br /><br />The plot twists and turns are certainly exaggerated (the man in Argentina, the Organization, the coincidence of the Paris participants, etc.)  but it made for very entertaining reading.  My mind often wandered to who would play these characters on TV or in a movie.<br /><br />As the book progressed I did skip some of the non-essentials when reading about a scene from yet another character's perspective.  Maybe that was because I was eager to see the next twist.<br /><br />The way the book ended I am not sure the author can come up with the next in the series but if he does, I will certainly read it.  It was fun.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works well and helps to streamline the process of checking my emails. Anyone who has yahoo mail may as well use this app. It is free after all.
B000OLRH10|4.0|This is a spectacular film however the video continued to need to pause for buffering despite myself being connected via ethernet to a stable high speed connection.
B005HSL626|2.0|The game itself runs smooth on the KindleFire. The graphics are clean, clear and colorful. I just found this game completely pointless and an utter waste of time. If you're into that sort of thing, and do not want to have to use your mind in any way what so ever, or if you're six and just like to watch fruit splatter everywhere, then this could be your jam.
0316286443|5.0|I was thoroughly amazed by the talent of Kevyn Aucoin. He totally took my breath away and made me appreciate and respect the power of make-up!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I stopped reading Grisham for many years, but I picked this one up since I had exhausted the current Richard Castle books and I needed something to read over Christmas.  It did not disappoint!  It was extremely well thought out, amazingly intricate, but easy to follow, and as with most Grisham books, well written.  If you've stepped away from Grisham, this one will bring you back and make you want more.
B005ZHB84U|5.0|After watching the new movie we really wanted to own the sound track, it's great and some tracks will no doubt make their way to the iPod.
B006O6F932|5.0|Set up was easy, I was quite surprised at how big this set is and the ease of use when folding up.  I like this due to the fact that you can close it up and it doesn't take up much space.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Typical Stephen King greatness with just the right mix of gore, humanity, and imagination.  A good read that I wish would have been much longer.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Looking forward to Book 2 in the series. Christian Grey is a very interesting character! It will be fun to see what happens next!
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I love the app alot but if you have demo you rally need more time to play built a trothie it took me a long time
B004LWZWGK|1.0|The digital copy contained in this pack is for use with an application called Flixster ONLY!!  Yes, the movie can be downloaded to your computer, and moved to an tablet or phone, however, it has to have the Flixster app to watch your digital copy.  This means no watching via your AppleTV or Android/Other bases TV streaming device, unless you can get the Flixster app.  This also requires a UltraViolet account, a Warner Brothers account, and a Flixster account.  If you are like me and prefer digital copies, then AVOID this product and grab it on iTunes.  This was a very sad attempt at Warner Brothers for trying to make the consumer buy another copy of the movie.  Several other companies are doing it as well, such as Sony.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Should be required reading for every US history class! Explains why the US is like it is today and why it will (sadly) remain that way.

0399160450|5.0|Hang on to your seat Tom is back. This book was worth waiting for. It has more action than a Las Vegas casino. Alot of the old characters are back, for those of you who have read some of the older books, ie Bear & Dragon. I am detail oriented & this book delivers. The story line starts where the last book left off at. I won't ruin the story line just surffice it to say it was hard to put down like most Clancy books. If were not careful & diligent there could be alot of truth to this story. Yes its a big book but if you read like I do it will be money well spent.Thank you Tom Clancy for another excellant book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A must read for Warriors. I could not put this book down. I only wish there were more books by Chris Kyle
0312330855|4.0|I enjoyed this book, it offers up light entertainment with a bit of a laugh. If you want to unwind & relax this will  hit the spot. If you're after action & excitement however look elsewhere. It's extremely easy to read & I would recommend it to most readers.
0765325950|3.0|Didn't like a lot of plot twists and changes made to the characters, can defiantly tell where Robert Jordan stops and Brandon Sanderson starts.  A gathering storm and a tower of midnight left me feeling the same way.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I only need 2 more seasons and my collection is complete!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun, simple but challenging. I recommend it. One of the most fun ones  I have played so far. I'm addicted.
B0000028MA|5.0|If you like grunge music then this is a must-have for your collection.  This has it all and even some more obscure stuff like The Screaming Trees.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Ok so I am a young teen and I skipped the \\"romance\\" part but other then that it was awesome! The end was so sad yet so happy that I cried! I love Maggie's books and if you do to you should read this book!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This alarm is easy to use and works reliably.  I may decide to upgrade at some point, but this simple app is an easy way to turn my Fire into a useful alarm clock.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is an excellent game. I love it. The lack of certain islands (Greenland, Iceland, Philippines, Madagascar, etc.), however, is my biggest problem with it, as you cannot win if ANY of these islands close their borders. One thing I especially love about it is that you can unlock every feature without having to pay money (except for a different gamemode called the neurax worm). Excellent game, definitely worth just a buck.
B004J4X32U|5.0|This book is changing our entire view of raising our daughter.  The chapters are easy to read and the strategies work!  We are only a few chapters in we are already seeing the fruits of our labor.  The approaches take practice and force us to think in an entirely new way..... But we are investing in our relationship with our daughter and we will all be healthier for it.  By the way - these are super strategies for all parents but especially for adopted children.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this series but they are a little long but it's worth the money to pay for the first book
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Ms. Krall comes through with a great list of Christmas songs and delivers spot on with a sassy jazzy style all her own
B003WUYRGI|3.0|Okay not bad i think you might get it because I'm American and i am also Latin so that's it
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have to say this book was good. I didn't really like the ending though. If u like to read mysteries than I would definitely read this book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It is clear that the author really knows his science and physics and this book is filled with it, which is an essential part of the narrative.  The central character Mark Watney is witty and amusing and I was laughing out loud frequently while reading this book.  I particularly enjoyed candid contemporary language that gave the entire narrative a gritty credible reality.  It is unusual to find a book where all of the characters swear and curse just like normal people do and it adds a delightful layer of verisimilitude.<br /><br /> I only have one very minor pet peeve where the author got some of his science wrong.  There is a situation where the Chinese supply ship is docking with the American interplanetary craft, and the supply ship is approaching at 2 meters per second from 60 meter range.  In final approach it is still going at .9 m/s.  This would be an absolute disaster for two multiple ton spacecraft!  I think he got his speeds off by three decimal places!  Somehow this glaring error really sticks out in my memory despite all the other excellent science and humor.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I think this game is very interesting and funny. if I were you I would try this game you might like it because I got to say I do....
B008OHV5C8|5.0|This trio is consistently producing interesting and exciting records.  While this one is not my favorite, it is still very strong and the rhythms are challenging and potent.
B00004WEJZ|1.0|sean connery is indeed a great james bond, but he should have stopped while he was seen that way. I am a the biggest james bond fan, and i even had to stop watching it mid movie. It was making 007 look stupid. he made the movie stupid. I am very glad they did not put the movie in the sequal. waste of my time. I RECOMMEND NOT GETTING THE MOVIE.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I like knowing how much battery life is left.  Good app for free.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This a great game with a little bit if everything also a lit if twists and turbs j absolutely kove this game
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Our kids LOVE this game and I'm freaked out about how good they are at it. They figure out all the little tricks. It's crazy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it so far. Never been interested in horses but this is different. I am going to . Play it for one week to give it a shot.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Yep, we're all loving this silly, simple, &#34;Pong-style&#34; game. Try it! Why is there a minimum number of words required for reviews???
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Engrossing storyline.  Well directed, filmed and edited.  A cast that is outstanding!  Lange is brilliant!  A 'tour de force' for certain.  (I like Pepper, too)<br /><br />If you didn't get to see it, be sure to get each episode on Amazon; at $2.99 a pop, you won't see better!  And whatever you do - don't see it out of sequence!  :-)
B008458O3S|4.0|It's too complex for me & hubby, but our toddler is totally addicted to it and does really good! I'm too impatient to watch the tutorial, but our 3 year old can't get enough of it.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Fascinating depiction and implicit comparison of raising infants in San Fransisco, Tokyo, Mongolia and Africa.  Not a lot of editorializing, just shows you and gives a lot of food for thought.  Beautifully done.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This Bio makes Jobs look childish bu is more revealing about Apple and how the company grew to be the largest in the world.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Best season of greatest TV drama in history.  What more can you say?  LOVE this show. Extraordinary character development, extraordinary acting.  Giancarlo Esposito rules in this season!
B0093STBP0|5.0|Enjoyable. Entertaining. Feel good movie, yes. An lots of insights on the chefs of the world atmospheres, tantrums and anxieties.<br /><br />There are no killings, no sex, no Finantial conspiracies, no secret service operations. Sheer human warmth against obstacles of natural human adulthood. Comedy kept alive with some slapstick. Characters well drawn without too much depth, although with greater sensitivity that you could have find in Julia and Julie . If you look for Bergman or ken loach, keep searching.<br />Written by a collector of movies related with food and cooking, as chocolate, Babette's, la grandebouffe and many, many others.
0307744434|4.0|Loved the original storyline and savored the level of descriptive writing that rarely comes from the bloodstream of a visual artist. The tone of the story is perfect for late-night escapism yet I wanted more action vs. subtle, safe romance. It seems like there was a lot of editorial attention given to making the novel fit the hands of young adult and adult alike. I could accept this until the story dragged on with disjointed characters that brought no depth or development, and the magical elements became flowery and far-fetched. If the book would have closed up 100-150 pages sooner, I think it would have been a tightly woven package. I will look for this author again with the expectation that she has learned to exercise novelist's control.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great read ... can't wait to start book 2.  I love the variety of families and relationships. It's a great read for both male and female readers.
B000W99IPM|5.0|Pros:<br />You get all (or most, anyway, since Le Sage's collection seems to contain more) of Schumann's solo piano music cheaply.<br />Demus has a real feeling for the music.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The recording quality is, here and there, uneven.<br />And:<br />• Repeated transitional beat (he made a mistake, so he repeated the phrase) in one of the Fantasiest&uuml;cke Op. 12--which ruins the piece.<br />• Skipped beats. One of the Drei Romanzen is ruined because of this.<br /><br />Otherwise, no regrets.
141659521X|4.0|I think Vince Flynn is losing his edge with the Rapp series.  This was better than &#34;Kill Shot,&#34; but far from being a great thriller.  The books seem to be getting more preposterous every year.  Maybe I'm just getting harder to please.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a wonderful writer. Loved this book as much as the previous ones. Can't wait for her next book!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love My Little Ponies! I downloaded it for my toddler &amp; ended up playing also! Such a fun &amp; addicting game!!
B009GESJH2|3.0|Not much different that his previous released CD.  Waited a long time for this release, just didn't have the wow facture.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great television series! If you like campy horror movies you will love this show!!  Jessica Lange is wickedly awesome as a nun with her own agenda running an asylum.  Supporting cast is great as well.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|There is something very special about her music, just find it hard to explain. Her music just seems to put you in a good mood.
B009NT4D8E|5.0|Every once in a while a movie comes along that is truly \\"not\\" from the conjuring ability of the far reaches of a man's imagination.\\"Alien\\" and even the latest \\"War of the Worlds\\" TC solidly delivered a concept that was totally original and advanced.<br /> Alien managed to be so extraordinary that it remains the definitive on the subject of extra terrestrials atleast to me- one for believability exceeding even once epic \\"Close Encounters...\\"  albeit surely for inventiveness and definitely originality.<br /><br />Alien with its deep, isolated, contemplative environs was a film with keen momentum. It was science and space travel, isolated work and resting in suspended states. Even with the emergence of Aliens and Alein 3 certain keys were relatively maintained so as to respect the original movie.<br /><br />Some 15 years or more down the line from the last relatively cohesive sequal, Prometheus' opening was of critical interest, forcing me to the movie theatres after a decade or more hiatus. I didnt want to miss one special feature or 3D effect. I even saved the movie tickets...<br /><br /> Well the movie missed the mark -numerous times- with its cliche's and somehow obvious mishaps. Several things annoyed me about this movie and I have listed them here...<br /><br />1) Mogul and developer Weyland seemed to look like a professional makeup job more so then anything else and he was not entirely convincing in my oppinion-<br /><br />2) Weyland's daughter in charge was too similar to other Hollywood actresses doing not so similar cryptic roles in recent years. She was also too white-washed. The script was extremely predictable and she seemed more a fashion style study ie decked even with high heels reminiscent of the present then looks of the far future setting.<br /> I would assume, based on the time of the film, that Weyland's daughter could be genetically enhanced but at the same time she seemed to be too cold and authoritative to convey earthy fear and vulnerability, astirring effect well used with Sigourney Weaver. I will say at certain times she did try though. In that sense, the film turned its back on the original Alien and the sequels which were often so subtle and sensitive that a definite mood was created and maintained.<br /><br />3)The emergence of several characters and mechanized voices with a pronounced \\"English/British\\" accent was over burdening and seemed to be a recent trend concept and surely not based on the movie setting at all which seemed to ignore the dominating all \\"American\\" working class tone of the original movie and several sequals.<br /><br />4)Several times the robot droid said phrases that were actually echoes of the first film. Examples are \\"impressive\\" or \\"its organic\\" I keep wishing they had left those words off the script or used other descriptives.<br /><br />5) The connection of the engineers to creating us \\"the human race\\" even though it was what \\"they\\" the cave scientists/doctors \\"chose\\" to believe- was kinda \\"off center\\" and most definently not what the general consensus would seem to be open or bothered with as thought or concept but that could be arguable. It was annoying for me and a million miles away from welcome images of \\"God' or \\"Allah\\" and also truly not developed in any real clarifying sense. The extra terrestrial being was completely believable however and convincing as an alien life form to me. When the DNA matched us \\"humans\\" to the alien engineers, I was disappointed as it ruined some important mystique of their character and origin.<br /><br />6)The \\"far out\\" engineer/alien could have been maintained at around 10 feet in height for spooky effect vs 7.5 feet range as it appears in key screen shots and angles on film.<br /><br />7)The fact that the planet was different from the original Alien film is because as I recall in second sequel Aliens, the planet was \\"nuked\\" or blown up. That seems to be the main forgotten fact of the film that I can understand thus-far although dates and times would play a key part in confirming. So far with that there would be no return to the original planet which could have been more cohesive in a way.<br /><br />8) Although the alien pyramid design scheme was marginally successful to me, it could have been \\"developed\\" further in numerous ways even though I think a truly original scheme would be easy to do that could match the same tone of originality as the first Alien film. I think the artist HR Giger could have played a pivotal hand in the design of the pyramids beyond what he had already done albeit with more time.<br /><br />9) The octopus creature that would emerge from the med pod was marginally successul even though it resembled a robust or large octopus. I dont think too much work was needed on that creature but the \\"zenophile\\" that would emerge from the impregnated engineer at the end slipped when it opened its mouth. Neither the roar nor the mouth extension was needed to me. By having the creature quiet and examining the darkish surrounding environment would have easily set a more cryptic, haunting tone for the future.<br /><br />10) The fact that other space craft and engineer pyramids exist on the planet is slightly irritating to me because it reveals too much about what else is on the planet as a whole. By having several pyramids in the same area atleast allows for more space craft without giving away too much information on the rest of the planet and that gives room for a sequel on that subject matter alone. A possible way to capitalize yet on another sequel that is not forced to address the \\"end all\\" questions of the engineer/extraterrestrial origin or home.<br /><br />11) When the female doctor at the end said that she wanted to know where they \\"the engineers\\" came from she seemed relatively shallow, hasty and childlike. Not a bother much but it seemed thrown togethor with no follow up on just how the droid and remaining supplies could offer the opportunity for such long term, precarious exploration away from earth much less other humans and communication.<br />On another note, I am sure that to find the Alien engineer's home would be and is going to require some of the best Hollywood sci fi designers available first to try to pull it off with success.<br /><br />12) The alien craft which is probably the most original and \\"other worldly\\" ever- really needed force and momentum for the final ending scene of its ascension from underground. I am talking sounds or unusual light effects that could have gave it soom needed life. At the end, when the ship began to fall back to the ground it made no substantial noise- in a way there was no strong sense of debris or crashing and breaking which could be permissable but really isnt to me due to its size, the cargo and how the internal materials related in the film. Instead it ends up reminding me of a doughnut of sorts. When the ship ascended it should have had an unusual sound, vibration, light effect and or sense of motor. It instead was lifeless and forgettable despite the superb untypical design of it.<br /><br />13) When the humanlike robot droid predicted the engineer was headed to earth to \\"destroy to create\\" it seemed off regardless of the supposed weapons development. In fact the engineer should have never been headed any place necessarily known. What would have been better was if the engineer reacted more hostile, sensitive or inquisitive about the humans entering the flight navigation room. The engineer did in fact react to the humans as if they were cousins or relatively familiar entities and was not fearful or threatened even though the creature seemed on an inner time clock programmed to begin flight or shut down and go into hyper sleep. That part could be believable for even more important reasons but the inclusion of earth as destination should have been omitted because there is no solid exploration of the alien engineers having any lomg term qualm with the earth or humans atleast directly to destroy. Their own problems with contamination or outbreak seem to open room once for further look but closes the need to return to earth in lieu of their original interest in seeding the planet with their DNA or the first communications with human beings to me.<br /><br />14) In the beginning of the movie the alien who supposedly seeded the earth with its DNA was disappointing. I did acrtually think they were on their home planet not Earth. In this case we are treated to desolation and what appears to be briefly a mormon or sorted religious figure as the space engineer's into. The need to seed the planet is plainly a unconfirmed or more so explored concept and really could have been omitted. The flying saucer in the beginning arguably used did become literally vertical at one point as it ascended back into space but it was unimaginative even seemed worth little as something to pay attention to. One could have seen it as a lunar event or something like an eclispe because detail was truly absent.<br /><br />Overall I would not bother with this film although its stellar moments are  extraordinary. Scenes with the engineer were never without amazement but trust me one will have to pick and choose key parts to survive the films goof-ups. It seems that the directors and everyone involved should have seized at the chance to really make certain parts shine as bright as others. Attempts should have been made to enhance wherever they could to balance the movie out. Basically its slightly less intricate then the first three Alien films though it makes a good effort from time to time.<br />What is so annoying is that the concepts introduced here are a bit disruptive and substract from certain other elements.<br />  In conclusion it would be the Bonus/Extras disc that would have the most informative material on the movie itself and much more. Although it is a 7 hour segment and I only viewed 3 hours as of yet it was worth looking at. Loads of sci fi imagery, imaginative details, models, drawings, computer work, scaled demos, prep work, scripts, alternate endings make up for any movie shortcomings and has been recommended viewing with near A+ ratings from several news publications and critics.<br />The bonus extras will do many times over what the movie only attempts. Also the screen saver phase before the \\"Bonus\\" feature begins literally \\"blows one away\\" with linear, dreamy, super science effects as if at a flight console of a futuristic vehicle getting ready to fly to another distant planet on and on... The screen saver has program data and information on what to expect in the distant planet.<br /><br />Finally one could not help but get a sense of haste in this movie in relation to the original Alien film which was studied, slow and effectively detailed. What is most promising for the future though of the Alien movies at this point is that the engineers are not yet proven to have created humans which they do not set the tone for necessarily and the female doctor at the end has yet set out on the seemingly impossible problematic course to find the engineer beings home planet. All new subjects to develop on.<br />3D and digital formats were not discussed directly in this review.<br /><br />So for now I am returning to hyper sleep<br /><br />Peace till the next sequel-)<br /><br />End
B003MAOTP2|5.0|Love stories based on history.  This was a glimpse into an unknown piece of pre-Crusades history. If you are a history and sword-play buff you will thoroughly enjoy this Orlando Bloom / Liam Neeson pic.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|A good read, but was not able toi hold my attention like most of the Scarpetta series stories. Most I read at least twice, I doubt I will read this one again.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Interesting story but did not have me riveted to it.  The medical facts seemed correct , however being a student of the bible, I do not believe he experienced  heaven in any way, especially for a week. He was in a dream state, brought on more vividly by the meds he was on.
B00009NQQO|5.0|My 2 and 3-year-old girls love this toy. The net is fun, but they really like the three balls. They like how they are squishy and can be used as squirters. I always make sure the balls are squeezed empty of water before they are put away after bath time. I haven't seen any mold in them and we've had them for a year. The suction cups work just fine for us. If they hang up there overnight, they will eventually fall, but they hold fine for bath time.  This is our favorite bath toy! Highly recommend.
B007SXB498|2.0|A long tale and not my kind of story.  It was about a widow lady wanting her two marriageable age daughters  find a suitable husband.  All the players in the story seem to have this same pastime and providing tmes and events where it can take place. The verbage was in old English, sometimes with different meanings than today and the narrater didn't always make voice changes to distinguise who was talking. It became more interesting toward the end and I'm sure in the day it was written it was a good story.
B009E3EXMU|3.0|Maybe I'm too much of a purist, but I didn't enjoy Robert Plant's &#34;vocal stylings&#34; on some of the songs. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones were spot on and Jason Bonham didn't miss a beat. The screen behind the band was distracting, what was going on didn't go with the songs. I looked like the screen op just got a new board and was trying out all the settings and effects. You would think a project of this magnitude would inspire everyone to put forth their best effort.
B000001E7M|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. Listens to it often. Arrived on time and as described. Great tape.
B00005JLKN|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my brother, it is one of his favorite movies. We are very satisifed with the quality of the DVD and the packaging.
0812550706|5.0|One of my all time favorite books, if not my favorite. I already had a copy which was part of a box set and didn't want my husband messing up the pages, so I bought him his own. Now he can do whatever he wants to it. This is an amazing book which everyone should read at least once. Arrived on time and as described. highly recommend.
B005LAII12|5.0|Purchased Ted for my brother for Christmas. He said it was extremely funny and is currently his favorite movie. Very satisfied with this purchase.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|This was purchased for my brother as a Christmas gift. He is very happy with his new movie, and is obsessed with anything \\"Boondock Saints\\".
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Some helpful cooking ideas, but the title is misleading in that it teaches very few useful ideas regarding becoming a four hour chef.<br /><br />The book is so scattered that you may read about knife techniques and then a few pages later be reading about skinning an animal.  It is very convoluted.  There are some helpful techniques and recipes, but they are a small part of the book.
B00005JL96|5.0|This is one of our all time favorite Disney movies. You can't help but fall in love with the characters, the setting and the music.
0316228532|1.0|The Casual Vacancy starts off slow and never picks up speed.  The many characters are hard to keep straight, and after a while you stop trying because none of them are likeable anyway.  Many side notes in parentheses go on for pages where a paragraph would suffice (and at 500 pages there is certainly room to cut).  It seems like Rowling felt she had to prove herself capable of writing an adult novel and resorted to big words and lofty, unnecessary descriptions.  Once you get through the tedium and reach what could have been a decent climax, it ends up being depressing and making the characters even more vile.  What a huge disappointment this book is.
B004R2DS9C|5.0|Really good case for the Legos and play mat. It's durable and not flimsy like I thought it might be. I recommend this tou for sure.
B004NELBPC|3.0|seems to present the site in a usable and pleasant way.  has not caused any problems. with more time I might up the rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book hit really close to home. It was entertaining, riveting, and honestly therapeutic. I will read this again and again. It captures your heart and doesn't let go.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you are a King fan, you will not be disappointed in 11/22/63. The book is long enough to have great detail and good character development, but not so long as to bog down in too many rabbit trails. One complaint that I have with some King novels is that they don't have a satisfying conclusion (like &#34;Cell&#34;), but 11/22/63 finishes beautifully. A morality tale (everything you do matters), a love story (not too much detail-thank you Mr. King!) and fast paced enough to keep you up at night. I loved it and recommend it very highly.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|First rate production -- great lead voices.  The finale with Andrew Lloyd Webber and previous Phantom stars is not to be missed.  It is so good that I have bought copies as gifts for friends.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is funny, has a great storyline and is such a good movie for any group of people to watch. It's awesome!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Bible.  I am<br /><br /> currently enjoying having the Bible on my tablet. I like know the Bible can be read aloud to me kudos.<br />Holy Bible
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Don't bother reading the book, just watch the show.  I found the author's use of the English language irksome. The plot isn't particularly bad, but the writing style for the more sophisticated reader is distracting.
B007N0AEWY|5.0|nick waterhouse gives and amazing first impression. starting right out the gate it is clear how well he understands his craft.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really liked this book, mostly just shows a happy couple in love. I really loved the last few chapters.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun game and easy to navigate.<br />This game reminds me of Sim city and other similar games.
0765325950|5.0|Ok, I don't have the time to write an involved review, but I have to say that I loved this book.<br /><br />Yes, there were faults in some of the preceding novels (Jordan had a tendency to move a pace almost glacial during books 9, 10 and 11).  Yes, there are many threads that are not completely wrapped up.  Yes, some of the writing and some of the plot developments were stilted and underdeveloped.<br /><br />HOWEVER, we all have to remember that Robert Jordan passed away before writing this and while Brandon Sanderson was privy to many of his notes and exposition on how the last book should read, he couldn't know *everything* that Jordan intended.  Could Jordan have written AMOL better?  Absolutely.  He knew where this was going from TEotW -- if you have any doubts, reread the prophecies that popped up throughout the series.  Many of us had these 'figured out' and, upon reading this final book, we now know we were only guessing based upon what we knew, not what Jordan had in mind (there is one is particular that is apt that I cannot state without giving away the ending).<br /><br />So, with all the caveats, I loved this book.  I gasped, I cried, I said &#34;Oh no, NOT HIM&#34; out loud.  I couldn't imagine a better ending to a series I've been reading for 20 years (I can't believe it's been that long... oh wait, I can).  In fact, as I read the final page... even though the series has spanned 14 books and hundreds of thousands of words... I wanted more.<br /><br />Is this book with fault?  Sure.  Some characters died mundanely, some never received closure, many threads were never wrapped up (Verin's letters, and what they said, were one... did you really expect that a series with 14 books and 11,000+ pages, that ended with a difference author, was going to wrap up every single loose thread?).  Some characters, and their actions, seemed off.  Sometimes the writing style was a little stilted because Sanderson is trying his best to write like Jordan, who was a master of prose (and thus, could ramble)... but his writing style is far more direct and to the point.  Some of the plot developments (read:  Demandred) were a little off because there wasn't much detail given to them, and some of the character actions were off (read:  Demandred and occasionally, Egwene).<br /><br />But, overall it was written well, followed Jordan's vision, has suitable closure for many of our major and major-minor characters, and was a fitting end to a series that many people have followed faithfully since the early 90s.  It had moments of true sadness, moments of levity, moments of shock and many moments of brilliance.<br /><br />Thank you, Robert Jordan, for giving us the Wheel of Time and letting us follow your vision to the end... and may the Creator shelter you.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The G5 COLLECTION OF GAME ARE VERY INTRIGUING!!!THESE GAMES KEEP YOU&nbsp;IN SUSPENSE. WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE  DONE  THE GAME TAKES ANOTHER TURN!!!! I ONLY WISH THE WHOLE GAME WAS TRULY FREE!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I couldn't put down the first two books in this series and so far the third (Two Graves) has been just as riveting. I love detective/mystery novels and these ones take the cake!
B008BQ8VOC|1.0|I couldn't find Season 2 anywhere.  I was very impressed with the procedure and quality of the videos.  Great set-up!
B0079XNWQA|5.0|What a refreshing album! I heard a song from this album on Pandora and just had to check it out. SO GLAD I did. Wonderful singing and musicianship. The quality of the recordings jumps way ahead of so much of what I hear these days. Even the previews sound pretty good but.... just wait until you hear the CD.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Actors that you know and love in a fast paced fun movie.  Not your average date movie, but even your date would laugh.
B008F5YDRI|3.0|Funny movie with a little love story thrown in.  It is not something I would highly recommend but it is not a bad movie either.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Best book Ever!!!!! This is an excellent read I personally recommend it for 9-16 year old's. Particularly lovers of fantasy and adventure stories.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I am not typically a sci fi guy.  This movie is awfully violent and bloody.  The scene with the bloody kid is too much.

B001UEBHYS|5.0|I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  It is a story of overcoming hardships and remaining true to one's self.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A great movie if you just want a good chick flick. Ya  I couldn't help but enjoy this movie. Even tough I don't watch too many movies like this I have really enjoy this one. Very dramatic and good acting.
B002U3CCBK|3.0|I read this book but in the end it seemed very pointless. But then some things we do in life, some things that happen are or at least look that way. I didn't catch on whether this was an actual event. If it was it needed recording. If it wasn't I pity the author trying to birth this one.
B0006L0LOS|2.0|Fans of cat woman would be disappointed. I like cat woman but this movie is awful. It's one of those WTF movies. The plot was weird and well just ban. I am a huge comic book fan and very disapointment to see one of my favorite characters be portayed so bad.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I think it is really cute but I dont like the fact that it costs money but it is so worth it. I asked my dad about buying this app he didn't mind so I got and it's really cute. My sister got this app and it looked fun. But this is the first app I ever got that costed money so I felt really alive. So my point is it is really worth it and I think you should get it. All of the other ones are really bad so I really want people like you to get this app. Well that's all I have to say. Thank you for reading.

B009RH973I|1.0|This case is very cheaply made. I did return this case for a refund. It is light weight that is for sure. To me it was not worth the money. To make it stand I did not think the flap tucked into the slot very well. It seemed as if it was going to fall over while using it. I do not recomend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't really know how to review this book without giving anything away let me start by saying THANK YOU for this story it was very healing for me in more ways than one :) I Loved the development of the story although I kinda had a few things figured out my only complaint is that there was no epilogue so I guess that doesn't reflect the book at all once again thank you
B009KHCT94|3.0|story had promise but they blew it big time, the f/x is the best part of this movie, what a waste of a plot

0316023744|4.0|Following the download of this book, I had a moment of buyer's remorse. Why was I purchasing yet another history of The Second World War? Having read many covering the entire war and greater numbers on various aspects of the conflict, was I really going to discover anything I had not already learned?<br /><br />My interest in this period can be traced back to the books in my father's den. Among them was a collection from Time-Life on the war. I can still visualize the photo of Wavell & O'Connor discussing strategy in the desert, the Japanese tanker's flame-thrown skull, and the sailor kissing the nurse in Times Square. Those images were the catalyst for decades of military history reading. Thankfully, historians like Beevor, Atkinson, Evans and others have done us a service with fresh, rich research and writing.<br /><br />Beevor's decision to tackle this \\"amalgamation of conflicts\\" must have been daunting. The scale of the conflict boggles the mind. The complexity of decision-making and the range of personalities involved will never truly be comprehended. I have tended to follow the Western conflict more and specifically the ground battles but Beevor does an admirable job in the Pacific (and with the air and sea wars). In fact, he contends and shows how the German and Japanese conflicts deeply influenced each other and states that the \\"Second World War defies generalization\\".<br /><br />Not only was the Second World War an amalgamation of conflicts, it's origins were an amalgam of issues dating back to the Treaty of Versailles and earlier. Beevor's treatment begins with a satisfying analysis and review of those issues whereas so many histories commence with Germany's invasion of Poland. It was a war of ideology on the surface but when it is objectively analyzed, economics were underpinning both Germany and Japan's motivations and decision-making.<br /><br />There is one thread in the book that is not emphasized by Beevor and that is the impact of the fall of France and the resulting Vichy government. Throw in the performances of Petain, Gamelin, Darlan, Wygand, Reynaud, and de Gaulle and it becomes difficult to find one single thing that is positive about French conduct. Even the storied Resistance is being exposed as not as widespread or effective as it has been credited. It may be that post-war propaganda created an inflated mystique to make up for the sins of Vichy.<br /><br />I am not that harsh and recognize that though strategically and tactically bested, many French formations fought with valor in 1940. For me, it is the fact that France's capitulation had such huge and far-flung ramifications. Without the captured French motor-transport, Hitler would have been severely limited in mobility during the invasion of the Soviet Union and Japanese aircraft flying from Vichy airfields in Indochina would not have sunk British vessels. Perhaps more fascinating is how France's fall impacted its colonies including laying the groundwork for the extended Vietnam conflict. So much turned on the Fall of France that it is worthy of a separate treatment.<br /><br />But many aspects of World War Two require their own study given its magnitude. The conflict in China is another example. The Communists did not deserve to win the country given their strategy and performance against the Japanese - it was both cowardly and opportunistic. Certainly the Nationalists were corrupt but at least they were fighting for China and running the country at the same time. And that fighting tied up close to 700,000 Japanese soldiers that benefited the Allies' Asia campaign immensely.<br /><br />Another aspect needing its own history is Ukraine and the Nationalist movements who tried to use the conflict to gain independence. According to Beevor \\"older, more religious Ukrainians had been encouraged by the black crosses on the German armoured vehicles, thinking that they represented a crusade against Godless Bolshevism.\\" We now know that these Nationalist movements fought the Soviet forces midway through the 1950's with some battles being of regiment size.<br /><br />Beevor's research has turned up new material. Among the most contentious is Japan's dehumanizing of troops in their militaristic society and revelations of that army's use of prisoners as food sources. He rightfully points out the Peleliu is the battle in the Pacific that deserves more recognition. It was the worst and unbelievably could have been bypassed. Nimitz's rare mistake accounted for nearly 10,000 Marine casualties. This is similar to Monty's decision after the capture of Antwerp not to immediately clear The Scheldt that ended up costing the Canadians 12,873 casualties.<br /><br />Other intriguing aspects include Italy's preparations, strategies, and performance being extremely poor. Even the well-trained Italian Alpine Corps, the Alpini, were badly supplied and resorted to making footwear from the tires of Soviet vehicles. Incredibly, 8,000 Allied bomber aircrew died in training accidents equaling roughly one-seventh of their total casualties. During the war years in France, \\"The average height of boys dropped by seven centimetres and of girls by eleven centimetres\\" due to food shortages. And the Kursk battle has always focused on tanks but Beevor notes that \\"the aerial engagements were among the most intense of the whole of the Second World War.\\" The book is replete with these facts and observations.<br /><br />The author points out that, \\"Alliances are complicated enough in victory, but in defeat they are bound to produce the worst recriminations imaginable.\\" That is because wars produce such amazing personalities, both good and bad. My enjoyment of history has evolved into the study of human behavior in extreme circumstances. For me, that brings history to life and historians who can write with this dimension in mind are to be lauded.<br /><br />George Marshall never ceases to amaze me with his quiet statesmanship and outstanding organizational skills. Then you have Fredenhall - the incompetent, Kesselring - the Luftwaffe leader who exceled at the defensive ground war, Wingate - the manic-depressive eccentric. There are just so many characters and personalities including Bradley who never impressed me so it was interesting to see the author reveal him as ruthless and ambitious even though he was presented as down-home folksy. It turns out that public relations was very sophisticated and used liberally with Rommel posing for magazine photos, MacArthur making monumental press-worthy pronouncements, Monty taking all the credit for success (he owes the RAF much for the desert victory), and the buffoonish Mark Clark who had a team of 50 public relations professionals burnishing his image in Italy.<br /><br />Increasingly General Vatutin of the Soviet army is being viewed as one of the war's more creative commanders (especially in the Soviet forces). He might have been the one entering Berlin had he not succumbed to injuries in 1944 after being ambushed by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (in 1920 he had fought against the Ukrainian peasant partisans of Nestor Makhno).<br /><br />Clearly, the war was won on the Eastern Front. The sheer size of the conflict there is confirmed in the losses of soldiers, citizens and materiel (the statistics become mind numbing in scale with half a million dead at Stalingrad alone). For the Soviets to bounce back, it took not only feeding men into meat grinder battles (which they have been appropriately criticized for) but also the ability to put their economy on a war footing and to gain sophistication in intelligence gathering, camouflage, battlefront deceptions, and inter-service coordination. Certainly, the scale of forces and their vast geography ultimately made for the Soviet victory but so did a conscious decision not to be rigid in doctrine.<br /><br />So after reading my buyer's remorse dissipated. There are fresh insights and research and the author's style always engages. However, it is clear that Beevor is overwhelmed. The last quarter seems rushed which takes away from the fact that the conflict was actually escalating towards its end (the German army lost 451,742 dead in January, 1945 alone). As extraordinary as his talents are, it is just too daunting a topic. This amalgam cannot be generalized and given its scale, difficult to distill without losing its complexity.skills.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I felt that this is an amazing book about young people discovering a new love through a fate based on a forgotten past.  Sky and Dean have discovered each other at a grocery store and have instant feeling.  As their feelings grow so does their recognition of a friendship lost and a past that must be remembered so that it can become a real truthful living past.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent book. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book. Hopefully the movie is just as good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Games start off simple but the more you play the more they progress very fun family friendly app and easy for kids to play. Includes a lot of classics with a twist.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|Being my opinion of course, this one isn't quite as great as 'Ready for the Weekend' but a lot better than 'I Created Disco' Highly recommend...<br /><br />edit: This is weird, Track 2 Bounce was edited odd so when imported into iTunes, it isn't immediately recognized as part of the album and is even missing from my iPod when displaying Album>18 Months. It's not gone just gotta touch up the ID3 tag. Extra steps suck
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was just amazing Good Job Mr. Riordan! Can't wait for the House Of Hades it's going to be great
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Put this on Kindle and my grandchildren love it.!<br />I have fun with it as well. Great game for kids and grown ups too.
B0070066DI|3.0|The mounting is not sturdy enough and the upper brackets bend in the installation process.  It makes it difficult to know if you are tightening it too much or too little, or if the tension is anywhere close to similar in all 4 posts.<br /><br />I got one core 6 degrees higher than the other three, but since the install is a bit of a pain, I'm going to leave it as it for a while to see what gives -- rather than re-seating it, which is what should be done.<br /><br />I wish they had designed the upper part of the mounting system better.
B003CR9BYE|5.0|ellant.,i love them . i'm a frank sinatra fan grew up with mr. frank and my way new york new york
B009YQJ322|5.0|I have to admit I was a little skeptical about this movie, but when I found the positive reviews I decided to take a chance. In fact I want to join the positive reviews myself. I loved the movie. It is dark, reminding me of Michael Mann's movies (\\"Collateral\\", \\"Heat\\") and even Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\". It is action packed, but nothing is unrealistic and explosions used only sparingly. This movie is not trying to overdo special effects to fill gaps of plot. The acting I found excellent: although you never see Dredd's face (Karl Urban) because of his helmet/visor, he uses the lower part of his face and his voice with such an effect that still gives you a solid and likable character. Olivia Thirlby (\\"Judge Anderson\\") is also doing a great job of a nervous rookie coming to age under duress. Altogether and excellent action movie.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I love this series and have read it multiple times.  It's an easy read but and wonderful story for all ages.  I wish it wasn't ending.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Colin is adorable. Lots of action. We'd heard it was pretty bad, but it was not bad at all. Fun.

B0052RDHTM|3.0|if you don't like war book this one is not for you .Love the story but I found it to long on description of every body . I kepted thinking something good would happen.
1439102430|4.0|I always look forward to the next chapter of &#34;our heroine&#34; and even though I get a bit &#34;squeamish&#34; at times, Kathy Reichs always comes through!
B000NY12LO|5.0|this book is one of the book Jodi Picoult wrote fantatic . Very good story line expect the unexpected . Enjoyed it so good .
030758836X|4.0|The great thing about this novel is that you have no clue what is coming next.  You continually switch loyalties to the characters as the story progresses.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|a bit slow at first but after that wow it was a good book loved it! This author will go far!
B008PZYLEI|5.0|Unexpected Good.. Great!! movie, must watch, love the logical turn on history made on this story. Just search on by release year and I found 2 since the 50's we must get more quality movies like this.

B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|Its good story, albeit a little short.<br />Worth watching if not only to see more of the Pixar catalog. Sidenote: Billy Connolly is hilarious in anything he's in.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I didn't finish it to boring . my daughter was in kind of a possesive relationship and it wasn't all crack up to be fun maybe that why this book turn me off.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|just download this game but so far I has been fun. I have a friend who has it so thats where I furst saw and played it.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I remember those days of the sixties.  The music was such a powerful force that defined who we were back then.  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray are so good and you can't help dancing to the classic music.  The story is powerful and it said so much about what we women had to go through back then.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Nice to see her back to the best of her talents and form.  I realize a writer can become tired, perhaps even bored, carrying on with old (but tried and established) fictional characters of her past successes, but she's proved that they've become more &#34;living&#34; to her readers than perhaps she realized, and, damn it, we missed them!  Also, I believe a little of her writing talent was affected by their absence. I think she missed them as well: an intellectual head thing without the heart. As I said, nice to have her back.  Bill
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|What can I say about Ryan Gossling?  This man is such a good actor in this film.  He is intense and pulls no backing when he takes revenge upon anyone that hurts the people he cares about.  This is no comedy.  My husband and I enjoyed it when it came out and I could not wait for it on DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Opening this book not sure where it would lead me and wasn't quite convinced the setting fit my reading preferences BUT the story's heroine captivated me from the beginning in the strength, perseverance, and evasive humility. She became extremely likable so quickly and I had to see where the unique character was headed. Her defiance to allow any one to define who she was, presented a strong female character that the pages just turned themselves. Enter Holder... who had his own reminders living his own demons of HOPELESS- ness and you can't help but keep the going all the way to find out how connected these two really are... The unexpected twists are only an understatement. And the shockenly last chapters will have you tearfully gasping and at one point &#34;closing your eyes&#34; to imagine the scene away or wanting to wrap your arms protectively around these to characters. Just READ.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is one of my favorite television shows. it is about a group of misfits at a community college who are in a study group for a Spanish class (which is taught by the insane Senor Chang--what, just because he's Asian doesn't mean he can't teach Spanish?!). It is funny, absurdist comedy, but it still has a lot of heart in the interactions between the characters.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this pinterest app. Although sometimes it crashes, but hey what app doesn't? I prefer the app over the desktop version.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so great for any horse lover!  I can't stop playing it!  I have no complaints.  this is the best app I have gotten.
0345803485|4.0|A REAL FAVORITE HERE AT RCS NORTHVALE!  RICH STYLE OF WRITING ALONG WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION.  NOT QUITE REQUIRED READING, BUT VERY INFORMATIVE.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Okay let start by saying how frustrated I am right now. I rented this movie with the understanding that I could wait to watch it until the 31st. As it said I could. BUT, when I did go to watch it, It wouldn't load. So I decided that I would wait a while before trying again. So I went to watch it tonight and to my disappointment.. THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO WATCH? Did I miss something. I would love a way contact somebody and get my money back or maybe the movie put back on my list so I can actually watch it! I'm very displeased with this. Guess i'll be using movie rental machines outside stores  for now on.  -_-
B006MPKAOI|2.0|unrealistic storyline, insensitive depiction of mental illness and unlikable characters - the main character is irritating and romantic lead drippy

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really makes you reflect.<br /><br />It was sad but it all made sense towards the end.<br /><br />It has a wonderful happy ending.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Game is great and much better than Temple Run. Well thought out and gives a feeling that you are competing against someone other than yourself. Can glitch if you aren't connected to the internet. And that can be frustrating.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It just finished without any justice at all. Such a disappointment. I felt like I was  being led to a terrific ending with justice  but no, just a godfather ending.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is another notch in Rick Riordan's  belt. The way he spins a tale would make Arachne envious. Entertaining for readers of all ages. Keep the stories coming Mr Riordan, my family await the adventure.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|This was incredibly disappointing.  At least use another voice instead of just Peter Griffin.  It's just an adult version of Family Guy, but not good like Family Guy. It's a shame too, because the idea is excellent.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|In the 1990s and early 2000s the two biggest comedies on TV were probably Friends and Seinfeld. Friends was aimed at the younger demographic, going for the viewers that were in their mid to late 20s. I actually never watched the series consistently when it was on the air. I was a senior in high school the year it began, so I just never really got into it and never appreciated how good it really was.<br /><br />It was one of those shows like ER, where the cast was made up of relative no names, but unlike ER the cast stayed together for the entire run. I think that allowed the show to keep the same feel and tone throughout the series. The writing was very very good in that they allowed the characters to evolve and grow over the course of 10 years but never lost the core of who they were over that time. They also did a great job of referring to old jokes without (for the most part) making them stale. The ones that did, it got to the point that they would even poke fun at it (for example \\"We were on a break\\"). I also liked how the show relied on more than just sex jokes for the comedies (unlike many of the sitcoms of today). While there were certainly sex jokes throughout the series, there were a lot smarter jokes in there too, that presumed the audience was smart enough to be entertained by other material.<br /><br />One big drawback (for some) in this release is that the episodes were only the ones that were broadcast. Apparently the DVD sets included a lot of extended episodes, but this is just going to give you the show as it was intended to originally be seen. If that is a deal breaker for you, then don't waste the money. For those who do not see that as a big deal, the series looks and sounds great on Blu Ray and will make a great addition to your collection.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game anyone who likes temple run and games like temple run will enjoy this game you might get addicted.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|The story, the acting, the directing were perfect.  How can you miss with stars like Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence who both did an amazing job.  For being only 22 years old, Jennifer Lawrence did an absolutely superb performance.  The ensemble cast was perfectly chosen, and all did outstandingly.  Even if you have seen the movie, buy the DVD to watch it again.
0525423842|5.0|I have had this book on my list for a long time.  It was in great shape and I received it in a timely fashion.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This has to be one of my all time favorites.  The story was funny and engaging.  Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor were perfect in their roles.  I heartily recommend this movie to all.

B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Like Cake Mania and Sally's Salon before it this is a completely addictive customer satisfaction game. Only start playing if you have a few spare hours you may be here a while.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|i really like the product which i received.It was a used item but the item was really good and no sign of used.
B000SGGUWS|3.0|I really enjoyed this book! It jumped between the 4 main characters, which made it fast paced (but not too crazy!) It was a little steamier than I expected for a YA read, so if you have a young daughter, maybe think this one over! Otherwise, fun book!!
B00513DGIO|5.0|A well researched book, which takes an unorthodox approach to analyse classic economic theories about money and debt. Brilliantly written by an author who has a solid background in anthropology and economy. A book which everyone working in banking and finance or with an interest in sociology should read.
B000067J1H|5.0|Good price, quick shipping, killer product. As advertised, I got my fresh copy of the movie, and even quicker than expected. Exactly what I wanted, sweet!
B00006GO99|5.0|Can't believe I am a musician and I wasted 40 years just hearing ABOUT Thelonius Monk, SO GLAD I actually took the initiative and purchase a CD. I am hooked!!!
B000URWYTS|5.0|I really liked this book.  Thought it was one of the better ones I have read in the last year.  FLW was definately a narcissist and rather repeated in his life what his father did to his family.  Also read The Women which include FLW's other love interests.
B005L38QK2|2.0|The mouse is ok, and the cord is nice. but there are these buttons on either side that I have to disable because I accidentally hit them all the time and they do things like change tabs in the web browser or shoot a spell in Diablo 3. Its whatever two buttons are on the pinky side of the mouse, so based on your handedness, you may need to disable different buttons.<br /><br />The lighting affects are cool and it is precise though. It has some robust configuration software to set all the buttons too. In my case All I've done with that is disable the two side buttons though.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game my grandkids and I love to play. You can quickly advance and everyone can enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game. is similar to the temple run game just dodging trains and getting coins. is really a fun game i have my nieces and nephew playing this game as well.
B00008WT5C|5.0|It is AC/DC and it sounds great. I don't know what else you could need to know. It is a great band.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was caught up in the storyline so much even at times there were tears in my eyes. Great read that's a little deeper than most chic lit books.
0765325950|1.0|No kindle addition ontil April!  I do not want this to become common.  Maybe the fear of a one star reviews will change the next publisher/author's mind.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is not your ordinary girl from small town meets rich boy...what a twist...girl meets boy who is  paraplegic and she becomes his caretaker....a big twist in this story,.but I wont give it away..you will have to read it for yourself...don't wait read this book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Let me start with the fact that I've never read any of Green's books. It was hard to choose (since I only had a ten bucks gift card) which book to buy, but I am quite happy with my choice.<br />&#34;The Fault In Our Stars&#34; is, I dare say, one of the greatests books I've read. It gave me this warm feeling and emotionally broke me at the same time. With an unexpected turn and an overwhelming end, TFIOS won't dissapoint you.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie, pretty decent cast, and terrific action! Definitely one to watch. This a terrific family movie - grab the popcorn, candy and drinks and settle in for a long ride.

B00A81NFAS|5.0|\\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Pat Solatano has lost everything -- his house, his job, and his wife. He now finds himself living back with his mother and father after spending eight months is a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet - and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany, a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.<br /><br /> The cast led by Bradley Cooper (solidly impressive, Oscar-nominated as Pat) (also executive produced), Jennifer Lawrence (in another impressively crafted, Oscar-winning performance as Tiffany), Robert De Niro (Oscar-nominated superb as Pat Sr.), Jacki Weaver (Oscar-nominated solid as Dolores) & Chris Tucker (also solid as Danny) is brilliant. The directing & screenplay (Oscar-nominated) (based on the novel by Matthew Quick) by David O. Russell is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Danny Elfman is brilliant. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is brilliant. The film editing (Oscar-nominated) by Jay Cassidy & Crispin Struthers is brilliant. The casting by Lindsay Graham & Mary Vernieu is brilliant. The production design by Judy Becker is brilliant. The art direction by Jesse Rosenthal is brilliant. The set decoration by Heather Loeffler is brilliant. The costume design by Mark Bridges is brilliant. The visual effects coordinated by Holt Lindenberger & supervised by Ed Mendez is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Ben Bray is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a brilliant well-crafted filmthat is entertaining and well-made. Bradley Cooper gives his best performance to date as Pat, which just gave him his first Oscar nomination, Jennifer Lawrence, more or less, surpasses her \\"Winter's Bone\\" performance, in another impressively crafted (recently, Golden-Globe & Oscar winning) performance as Tiffany, a character that is very much different for Lawrence's \\"Winter's Bone\\" performance of Ree Dolly, which earned her first Oscar nomination. Robert De Niro surprises as well in another well-crafted and well-deserved Oscar performance as Pat Sr. David O. Russell has directed and written another screenplay that is well-crafted and well-done, both of them deserving of their Oscar nominations that they have received. This is one of the best films of the recently-done holiday season, close to a month gone, and it is also one of the best films of the recently-done year, all deserving of the awards consideration that the film and its stars and director-writer have received to date, thus far.
1439148953|4.0|This book, set in the 1950s, takes us from small town Ireland to Brooklyn in the company of Eilis Lacey, a young girl forced into economic migration through lack of employment and the expectations of her family. Though told in the third person, we see through Eilis' eyes as we get to know about her life in Ireland with the mother and sister she loves, with friends and roots in a community she has known all her life; then we follow her as she is transplanted to Brooklyn, where she has the support of the Irish community but is so far away from her family, friendless and emotionally alone.<br /><br />T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's prose is wonderful and his characterisation of Eilis is very convincing - a passive heroine from a time and a society when decisions were still made by parents and community, before the rebelliousness and individualism of the sixties had begun. Trying to please everyone, learning to hide her loneliness and homesickness, Eilis' life is a small one - this is not a book full of dramatic plot twists and events; rather, it is a study of a gradual growing up as Eilis deals with the various changes that happen in her life and slowly starts to form her own opinions and make her own decisions.<br /><br />T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's descriptions of the voyage to America, Eilis' feelings of isolation and longing for her family, her gradual settling and her falling in love all rang very true. In particular, the passages relating to a bereavement and grief are beautifully written and enormously moving. As the book neared the end I found Eilis' thoughts and actions became a little less convincing and they felt a little contrived towards paving the way for a neat conclusion. But overall I found the book completely absorbing, beautifully written and a pleasure to read - recommended.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Hugo develops his characters and background extensively, providing the reader a deep understanding of relationships as the plot progresses.  Easy to put down and pick up again.  Not for those who want a quick read.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|well worth the rental, a great movie that will keep your attention. Clint Eastwood plays an excellent role in this movie
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I love the humor in this movie. It's out on the edge while still holding a story. This is not for kids and I'm glad. Really funny movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved this book!  I must admit in the beginning, I thought it was going to be a book with a typical ending, but boy did it take me for a loop!  There isn't much I can say about this book without giving it away.  It is a thriller that will pull you in and, if you're anything like me, will take you through all emotions.  Definitely worth purchasing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest has been a great time filler. packed with great ideas and tips. I love it and I am always pinning
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book had a great storyline and I liked how thoughtful Charlie was, but the way he writes got a little annoying. Like a 10 year old was  writing, not a 16 year old.
B0041T7FS6|5.0|This box set was done very well. First it gives a comprehensive overview of the Rodgers/Edwards penned songs. If you hadn't already, it makes you realize the amazing impact Rodgers/Edwards had on music history. Not only were they behind all the Chic songs, they also put Sister Sledge on the map, they wrote and produced Diana Ross' biggest selling solo album and they introduced Sheila to the world (other than France where she was already a star) with the unbelievably catchy \\"Spacer\\".<br />Second, all songs are remastered and sound excellent. All original extended versions are included wherever possible and the Dimitri From Paris remixes are superb. There are only 4 of 5 Dimitri From Paris remixes on this album, they are done without extra production, completely respecting the sound of the original song. All instruments are the originals, no unnecessary crap was added.<br /><br />Unfortunately Bernard Edwards passed away a number of years ago. Nile Rodgers was the executive producer of this box and it shows. It's nothing but the best. He wrote an interesting essay in the booklet and the pictures are gorgeous (check out the amazing front cover pic).<br /><br />After their Chic period, Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards went on to become high-in-demand producers. They produced Madonna, David Bowie, Duran Duran, Rod Stewart, Robert Palmer, Sheena Easton, etc. These 2 guys are legends and this box shows you the first stage of their insanely successful music careers.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was everything it was hyped up to be! Once you pick it up its impossible to put it down.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|As other reviews have mentioned this game clearly had a lot of work put into it.  It has a great story, and script that consists of 3 chapters, all of the back an forth between the lawyers is very funny.  The voice acting is amazing, and the animations are good, and add a lot to the game.  I loved the look, and art style of the game.<br /><br />I think this game seriously deserves a sequel or an add on, and if they do I can't wait to play.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I actually just found out about these guys about 5 days ago, and I cannot stop listening to them!! Macklemore is the best storyteller/lyricist in the game!! I can't stop telling everybody I know who likes good music to buy this!! It is a just press play kind of album, so don't just buy some singles, and Thrift Shop is not even close to his best work. Dude is a genius, and is gonna be superstar!
B004SCN2F6|2.0|The idea/concept of this game is awesome, but it doesn't live up to it possible potential.<br /><br />Pro:<br />You get to do what you want<br />Map is huge with lots to explore<br />Lots of customizable options<br /><br />Con:<br />Unattractive, ugly, unintuitive UI (user interface)<br />1980 Atari 4-bit graphics<br />repetitive missions<br />Text is very repetitive, text font and boxes lack any style, and the text is too small<br />Lacks any sort of actual main story or narrative<br />in game menus are ugly and all look the same<br /><br />I think if they at least had a better artist to make the game art at least somewhat attractive it would help this game a lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|When the rest of the world is in shambles and we are about to lose our second amend. rights, paying MORE taxes, wishing we had a REAL leader in the white house,....etc...I can turn on Downton and make it all go away! Awesome show!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I took my daughter to see this in the theater and we couldn't wait to see it in our home.  They all sounded great and looked like they were having the time of their lives up there.<br /><br />The bonus DVD is not what I expected, but still enjoy it.  If you like Led Zeppelin, you will love this release.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game will keep you busy for hour's. Love that they are simple  enough a child can play or even my grandmother!
B003HE2B9E|5.0|what a great new artist-my husband cant stop listening to the cd after falling in love with her guitar playing
B00594XOZU|5.0|!!!!!!It is the best so useful it is the best texting app thanks.I love this app so much thank you
B004LWZWGA|5.0|this movie was better than expected and truly worth the wait to get-have watched it too many times to count
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This was a stunning accomplishment. It was as if I was transported back in time to my childhood. Everything looked 'right'. The film, the props, the outfits - everything. Not only that, the acting was great and balanced, the story was engaging light hearted and innocent - with just enough of a dose of reality to make it not feel too surreal. Great accomplishment. I'll likley do something with this movie I seldom do - watch it again soon!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|the game was ok but I didnt like how you find one useful item then go all the way back to thenbeginning of the game to use it then back to where you were to find something else and do it all over again...
B006LS7DQE|2.0|This app took 75 minutes to download.  The directions are not cleary stated and the game is difficult to follow and play.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love the calculator.  It is full size and easy to read and easy to use and most of all free!
B004D9FLJE|5.0|My daughter has just &#34;discovered&#34; Glee and is enjoying watching every episode.She was a little young when the show first came out and now she is loving turning her friends on to it as well.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This was second try on the Amazon video system and this time the quality was excellent. Only problem came when for no reason the connection died in the middle of the movie. Had to start over completely and then the system would not resume where it left off. Amazon needs to look into these types of glitches if they want to dominate the online streaming business.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|You can't go wrong with anything written by John Grisham.  His stories pull you in from the beginning and entertain you through out.  I have my favorites and this is certainly one of them.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i haven't had any issues yet so far so good plays well I enjoy the different games that's available and like how you can play the same game more than once
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Tenderly written with beautiful development of the 2 main characters. The issue of euthanasia is controversial and sensitive. Facing these decisions must be difficult to make.
0765325950|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has proven himself to be the best choice to finish the Wheel of Time series. Not a single page in this book is superfluous. Considering the many different story lines and characters introduced in the 13 previous books, it's impressive to see how much was tied up and how much was left for the reader to imagine. There are genuine moments where you get chills, and tears.<br /><br />Considering how much foreshadowing there is in here, I found it remarkable how many times I was surprised by something. Unexpected deaths, unexpected survivals, interpretations of prophecies that managed to miss the fandom. Just a fantastic read. No disappointments here. No Deus Ex Machina's. The ideal ending to the series.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|sweet...effective ....used it to set my router position for best wifi reception in the building...did what I needed so thanks...
B000KKPN5C|4.0|I have a number of older full size flashes ranging from the SB-24, SB-26, and SB-28 but this is my favorite when I don't need full power. I use it on a D4 that has enough ISO range and with lenses that are f/2.8 or faster so there is less need for the flash but occasionally I need some fill flash and this fits the bill. It's a fraction of the cost of the SB-910 and substantially less weight. Unless you really have a need for a full size flash, the SB-400 will do the job with more discretion. It's a sleeper of a flash.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is app fun but on the computer it has dogs. if only this had dogs it would be so fun
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This series follows the book very closely and was superbly made.  The locations , costumes, acting is all top notch.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|One of the most addicting and brilliant games ever created - thank you for this puzzle game. I have wasted too much time on this LOL!  This App is beautifully designed and whoever conceived this game deserves his special place in the gamer' s Hall of Fame!
B009JBZH54|5.0|These discs were created with flawless quality on both picture ad sound. It will be a true home theater experience
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This was a great buy.  I would recommend it for purchase.  The walmart store didn't carry it except in blu rae and since it wouldn't play in my regular player.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I should have waited until I played the game first before buying the collectors but  this game designer is pretty  good. One critique that i I have about the alternate game to the HOG is that not everyone knows how to play dominoes. Bad choice. I don't know how nor have any intentions to learn but overall that doesn't impede on the fun aspect it just makes one try to find the objects a little bit harder.
B0063HBPH6|5.0|Another visit to my favourite armchair travel destination. As always, the discworld surpasses expectation. A must read for any fan of the series.
1439152802|2.0|I anm constanly reading- - to me it is like breathing.  I have read Kate Morton's books before, but never was I so disappointed in a book.  After 200 or so pages, I just gave up.  That is something I NEVER do.  Would not recommend this to anyone.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|The album opens with a thunderous &#34;Fresh&#34; and begins the listening euphoria that pulls you in and doesn't stop.  They sound as exciting as ever.  I can not stop smiling when I hear this and I can not stop listening to it.  I now want to buy all the old Devo discs that I once had on vinyl!
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a charming & delightful story, sad but redeeming.  My nieces will love this story when they're a bit older (which is why I bought the movie - to share with them).
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Truly enjoying this game. Very addictive and entertaining. Recommend to all, just make sure you have enough time cause you won't wanna stop.
0765325950|5.0|Probably was enough story left for three books instead of one, so wouldn't normally get 5 stars.  Given that the author died years ago though, I thought this was a great ending!<br /><br />*Spoiler*<br />I thought the Generals being compelled through their dreams was weak, as it seemed something obvious to guard against, but the rest was great!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I downloaded this game as soon as I first got my kindle. It is nice  to have a game that is enjoyable but that I don't feel like I'm running a marathon to have to win.
B005OHSD3A|5.0|If your ready to diet & shed pounds this is it.  Answers all your questions.<br />And it does work. It is a life style.  Youe feel better in many ways.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This was a gift for our son-in-law who had surgery.  He was laid up for a few weeks and requested some dvd's to help keep him occupied. We looked in every store in our area but could not find it.  Got on Amazon and there it was!  Thank you!
0307895475|5.0|Our son requested this for Christmas and he and his brother refer to it often!  They love it!  Thank you!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Spellbinding tale that grabs your attention. I did not know the  premise prior to reading the book...just as well or I might have missed out on a real adventure.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Enjoyed the action in the movie and the overall fast pace of the film. However, some elements had been explored before (time trival, demon child, etc.).
B004I744AS|5.0|I love it it is usefully if u don't know a word on the go there u go. easy and quick use it. any where u go
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a great book, I can't believe how it ended, I wanted the two of them to be great together! Now on to the next one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it does not require much brain to play this and yet I find myself showing coins over and over again loving the silly game
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|did not order this, evidently daughter did, she enjoys books like this where I like mystery and thriller books, great
B0063IH60K|5.0|Played solitaire since I was a child so that would make it about 75 years of it, Love this one!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a very great game. You will start out in a randomly generated world of blocks with different ecosystems such as deserts,forests,and tundras. You will start by chopping down trees and collecting wood. Then, you create a crafting table and from there you may do anything you want from exploring, fighting monsters, and of<br />course, mining.Find iron, gold, and diamonds,to make more tools.Eventualy<br /><br />, you will be able to create the... wait, that's a secret!There is local multiplayer and you may create your own username.At night, monsters  come out of the shadows . Be sure to build a shelter before that happens. If you would like to live a long, peaceful life, you can go to options and change to peaceful mode. This is an excellent game for the adventurous and creative.  You can play from third or first person view and there is no blood or Gore making minecraft a great game for gamers of all ages.
1933492953|5.0|If you've any interest in learning the craft either for film or sequential art, this is a fantastic guide to beautiful and dynamic style by a master of the form. It is not, however, a how to draw manual. Mateu-Mestre assumes the reader already has a great deal of drawing ability it is instead a guide on how to think critically about visual storytelling, framing and camera movement. Consider it an advanced class but well worth your time if you're a more serious/adept student of the craft. Filmmakers would also, in my opinion benefit a great deal from reading this.
0345803493|4.0|I heard great things about the Fifty Shades Trilogy. So far,  the books have lived up to their expectations. Fifty Shades Darker is just as good, if not better, than Fifty Shades of Grey. I was pleased with vendor and the time of shipping. It came just in time.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Easy enough to not get frustrated but challenging enough to keep my attention<br />Graphics were good.<br />Liked the story line. Would buy sequel.
B00136Q342|5.0|This is an absolutely classic country album. A real gutsy performance by Johnny Cash, and one of the best Live recordings ever. Buy this album.
B000JMKSE2|4.0|You probably already know what \\"the Long Tail\\" means.  If you don't, go take two minutes and find out.<br /><br />The concept of the Long Tail is simple and powerful.  Anderson first proposed the idea in 2004 and then elaborated it into this book.<br /><br />The book is a little padded as the author rings a lot of changes on the idea, some of them shallow and repetitive (but some not).  However, he also presents a lot of interesting data across markets.  This is valuable -- the value of this idea is not just how much fun it is to talk about (and it is a lot of fun), but how well it actually explains real-world phenomena.  So I appreciate data such as a table of book sales clustered by number of copies sold.  I was expecting 50% padding, and I was pleased that the book was only 30% padding.  That compares well with most books.  :)<br /><br />I would like to see more material on the temporal long tail.  Anderson writes about music categories such as \\"jazz\\", \\"classical\\", \\"pop\\" (and a lot of sub-categories and micro-categories), but he doesn't split the music by the year published such as \\"1970s\\", \\"1980s\\", \\"1990s\\".  A lot of musical trends are correlated with year of publication, and a lot of music listeners like the music they listened to during young adulthood.  That's got to have some effect on popularity of old music.<br /><br />Overall, though -- this idea explains a lot of markets, and non-market sharing, too.  You need to grok this idea and this book is a very good source.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Very interesting story about time and how humans look upon the minutes and hours that make up individual lives.  Three stories converge to make one very good novel.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This is my first Holmes collection.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes deserves his reputation -- defender of justice for all clients from high to low, but frequently solitary and withdrawn.  Watson is a perfect foil.  And the settings, from the teeming, noisome, city to the bucolic countryside (with crime always lurking underneath) work just fine for this 21st century reader.<br /><br />This e-book also includes 12 stories without Holmes and most of them are just as satisfying.<br /><br />Formatting: I didn't notice a large number of typos (and I have noticed on other books).  I'll have to defer to more expert readers on the chronological arrangement of stories.<br /><br />I have but one request.  Amazon, please add a new button: \\"Tell the publisher: I'd like to experience this book on Holodeck.\\"
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book took me by surprise. Wonderfully written, it is a beautiful piece. I enjoyed the story and love each character.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book, but didn't think that is was quite what it was hyped up to be.  Heard the last book was really good. Will get the whole series.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Interesting book.  Does drag on a bit in spots, but still an interesting read.  Would like to have had more information about the medical side though.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I really liked the movie, it addressed insecurities that people may have in a realistic way. It also was humor had humor and two really great actors.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Wonderful story honoring the members of the Red Tails and the sacrifice they made to the war effort.  In spite of the attitudes of the day the Tuskegee Airmen showed the world that we are all equal in Service, Honor & Duty.  Thank you for your sacrifice.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I got this cause I love the song Shake it Out but I fell in love with the whole album!
0316067598|5.0|Thank you Marcus Luttrell for sharing a very painful part of your life.  Not only did you honor your fellow SEALS, you showed me that there are in fact still good people in Afghanistan.  The peril that the village elder placed his family and village in protecting you is awe inspiring.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I got it cause of the song The Dogs Days are Over but I have fallen in love with the other songs like Kiss With a Fist.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I probably would have given it a 3 star until the end.  There were times within the book that just felt like it was dragging on.  But by the end the story was wrapped up into a surprising ending that I really enjoyed.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|great show...the writing is phenomenal, very witty. great acting as well. you won't be disappointed. definitely watch it if you haven't already!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Looking forward to seeing the story on the big screen. Going to be another blockbuster of a Nicholas Sparks book.
0425252868|5.0|This is a wonderful book and highly recommend it. It shows how true honor comes through in the most unlikely of situations.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is the first book by Jane Austen I have read. It was thoroughly enjoyed. I will be reading more by this author.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|My dad has an old VHS he takes out from time to time and the quality is pretty terrible. I found this and got it for him and he loves it very much. Thanks much!

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Not the perfect movie but a good movie for fans of the comic book. Gritty and portrayed the Judge Dredd universe well. Good for a quite Friday night with popcorn and beer on the couch movie.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|I fell in love with the hero's!  This is my second time through the series and I am happy to be back with my friends.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love this book! Read it in one day. It is sad, happy and truly romantic. I Give it five stars!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Just got the app today and my 2 yr old even likes it. Have to be careful or they can buy extras without knowing it.
145210655X|5.0|I got this book for my son. He and my husband love it. Cute book. My son has read it several times.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Realistic and not too complicated. I really like the concepts and the mini games don't take too much time. The diamonds take too long to get though and most items require them.
B007HACDLK|4.0|The story was good but the ending very disappointing, there should have been more to the story.  Good plot and story line.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is an EXCELLENT time killer. It's one of the best ways to kill time, and now that it's on the Amazon app store, it's better than ever. I highly recommend this app for anybody, even if they're not gamers.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Having lived in the middle east this story was very well written and had a lot of truth in it.
B008J9EYFG|4.0|I've been a fan of Beth Orton from the early days, and have followed her career with great interest. I will admit that I was let down by her most recent album, 2006's \\"Comfort of Strangers\\", as it seemed Orton wasn't quite sure how to evolve from \\"folktronica\\" yet remain true. After a long 6 year wait, we finally get the newest album (released Oct, 2012).<br /><br />\\"Sugaring Season\\" (10 tracks; 37 min.) kicks off with the most 'urgent' track on here, an almost epic \\"Magpie\\", which is the only track that features the backing band in full force. When tracks 2 and 3 \\"Dawn Chorus\\" and \\"Mystery\\" gently roll in, it is clear that indeed the days of \\"folktronica\\" are gone for good. But as the tracks go on by, what struck me is that the album sounds deceptively simple, yet in the end plain gorgeous. Check out \\"Something More Beautiful\\" (co-written with M. Ward), which reminds me of the sound from Over the Rhine. My favorite track on the album is \\"Poison Tree\\", which kicks off the second half of the album, and it's like Joni Mitchell from 40 years ago. Track 9 \\"State of Grace\\" is in the same Joni-vein, just great. As \\"Last Leaves of Autumn\\" opens with Beth on piano, my first thought was \\"Natalie Merchant\\", and I mean that as a compliment as well.<br /><br />At just 37 min., this album clips by in no time, and I have been playing this a LOT. I had the good fortune of catching Beth Orton live at the U Street Music Hall in Washington, DC last May, when she was 'road-testing' material from this album (playing Poison Tree, Candles, and Mystery), but also bringing many nuggets from the past (including a bunch from \\"Central Reservation\\" and \\"Trailer Park\\" such as Stolen Car, Sugar Boy, etc. etc.). What a great performance that was. Meanwhile \\"Sugaring Season\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is a total badass. There is no one like him, I just hope the movie franchise won't suck because it wouldn't do Vince Flynn justice. He has created the ultimate fictional spy/warrior. Mitch Rapp could take John Clark, sorry Clancy. Again be warned studio execs, if you screw up the movie like make it pg-13 I will hunt you down in cyber space and say mean things about you.
B008M36EEI|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie,<br />This is probably one of the best movies of 2012.<br />Highly recommend to watch it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was a very suspenseful Clancy novel. The only question was is how much of this did Greaney contribute? He needs his dues too.
0316228532|4.0|I have never read J.K. Rowling's books before, but if she writes another adult novel, I will be lining up to get it. I loved this book.  To be perfectly frank, I didn't like it at first. I was reading the Large Print edition and I read at least 100 pages before I was into the story. I contemplated giving up, and I am so glad I didn't. Once the story caught me, I was hooked. The British wit is priceless. The story is character driven and despite their obvious flaws, you really care about most of the individuals who make up this book.  The book's ending is one that should be kept secret, so I will not spoil it for those who have not read this book. If you like novels, read this book. It's good.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think leps world is like a videogame called Wwe 13  both over throw my mean stupid sister thanks net bro`s.
B004NDVJJG|4.0|Like many others here, I came to the music of the Marcin Wasilewski Trio via their work with Tomasz Stanko, and like others, eagerly anticipated their first unattached release. That and the followup were both excellent and so when Faithful was released, I immediately ordered it. And what a fine recording it turned out to be!<br />With the untimely demise of Esbjorn Svensson, it is left to fine pianists like Tord Gustavsen and Marcin Wasilewski to carry on advancing the musical possibilities of the piano trio. Faithful is a subdued and very tasteful album. The entire work is enjoyable but tunes like Night Train To You (evocative of Svensson), the smoothly flowing Mosaic, the dreamy Song For Swirek, and a jaunty cover of Paul Bley's Big Foot make it memorable.<br />Like all ECM recordings, Faithful comes attractively packaged and with a minimalist insert featuring a picture of the trio and pertinent album info. If you like piano jazz and haven't yet bought this, be sure to do so soon. You won't be disappointed.

B008476HBM|5.0|Titles as old as this are often found to be dry and boring to present day youth. Pride and Prejudice is something to be read by all teens. By choice hopefully.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even describe how awesome this book is. I was NOT expecting all of the little twists and turns laid out before me. I hugely recommend this book to....well, anyone. And I might add, it's a great buy..Bestseller for $3.99? It's an offer NO ONE should pass up!! :)

1470056496|5.0|Modern critics want us to think that Mansfield Park was Jane Austen's chance to go beyond being the author of well-constructed romances by going all moral guerilla on imperialism and the slave trade, and she blew it.<br /><br />Austen wrote what she knew and stayed in her comfort zone. Instead of a blistering diatribe, she gives meek little Fanny Price--and indignation on every page. Fanny is not in chains, but  enslaved none the less. Her life is taken away from her.<br /><br />At age 10 she's taken from her parents and siblings to Mansfield Park. Her aunt and uncle Bertram will take on the expense of her upbringing and raise her with their own children. Fanny gets a beautiful home, her own (unheated) bedroom, nice clothes, rich food and the best education an Englishwoman could hope for. In return she has no friends, possessions or autonomy. She must do everything she's told, be always acquiescent and grateful, wait on her exquisitely inert Aunt Bertram and thank Aunt Norris for her insults. She's considered beneath the value of firewood and isn't even given credit for being pretty! Someone else did it for her. When she dares to display independence she's shipped back to her impoverished family in Portsmouth to teach her a lesson. (The phrase \\"Sold down the river,\\" comes to mind. Mark Twain uses it in [[ASIN:048640885X Pudd'nhead Wilson (Dover Thrift Editions)]] to mean \\"put to hard labor as a field slave.\\" Fanny's trouble is nothing compared to that).<br /><br />Mansfield Park is about sexual imperialism and the enslavement of women.<br /><br />The luxurious and languid lifestyle at Mansfield is supported by slave-raised sugar. This fact is raised exactly once and instantly dropped. That 75% of the Bertram children are morally bankrupt Austen ascribes to bad parenting.<br /><br />Fanny is one of many examples in the Austen canon of women whose lives are not their own: Anne Elliot ([[ASIN:1612930859 Persuasion]]), Jane Fairfax ([[ASIN:B0013RV3PK Emma (by Jane Austen)]]), all 4 Dashwood women ([[ASIN:0486290492 Sense and Sensibility (Dover Thrift Editions)]]). Not to mention Charlotte Collins (nee Lucas) ([[ASIN:1612930425 Pride and Prejudice]]) who lands a pompous boob for a husband and has to spend the rest of life sucking up to insufferable Lady Catherine DeBurgh.<br /><br />Marriage, dear reader, was the only career for gentlewomen. The dread of failure to make a match is the subtext to all Austen's works.<br />It's not loneliness these young women fear-- To be a lady with no husband (or son) meant destitution. This fear is ever-present and palpable in all Austen's novels. It is even in Emma. Although Miss Woodhouse doesn't have any worries, the fate of the unmarried has its starkest example there in the characters of shabby genteel Mrs. Bates and her too too chatty spinster daughter.<br /><br />One of the few times Fanny Price shows gumption is when she talks on the stress of finding a husband. In addition to making a match there's the pressure of making a good one; that is finding a man who will respect and like you as well as keep you. Imagine gambling your whole life's happiness on a few weeks acquaintance? A woman was expected to be grateful to any man who shows attention and jump at any marriage proposal. A proper English lady goes from one master to the next (father to husband) without a peep and with tears of joy.<br /><br />Fanny Price's life on bondage is infinitely superior to slave labor. IN many ways she's better off that she would have been with the Prices--her home-bound sister, Susan, has no outlets for her natural talents. Austen points out the contradictions in Fanny's situation to acknowledge her and her culture's dividuality on issues that are black-and-white to us.<br /><br />You can read Jane Austen for entertainment and escape. She is an outstanding writer. But when you understand the context of her times--the imperialism she lived under, the role she was enslaved to--you understand why she is a supreme artist. She converted a frightening reality into wondrous novels. From could, rough straw she spins gold,  bright, lively and joyous.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is an awesome app.  I don't have a Kindle, but with this app it's like I do.  I love being able to download the apps from the Kindle store(amazon) and they download right to my tablet.  It's awesome.  Get this app!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have to spend a lot of time in waiting rooms and I find this challenging puzzle makes the time go by faster. It also is very addicting!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son loves Star Wars and Angry Birds.  He flipped out when I downloaded this one.  He plays it non stop.  At least he does until I have to use my tablet.  He loves it and it is really fun.  I played a little myself, when he lets me.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Powerful audio and visual Blu ray quality. I have watched this over and over and have enjoyed it every time. The entire cast is excellent  (sorry Jonas haters) and the production  values superb
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this game for anyone. It's a fun and entertaining game to play in your spare time! And, its free!
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|The scene with the hookers is priceless, I never laughed so hard in my life.  Not one for the kids.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Pac-Man was one of the original games that I used to play on the computer. It should appeal to old timers  like us. It brings back memories of conquering the computer.
B0030MM68O|4.0|This is a great war story -- not a documentary.  Do not spoil this movie by looking for anachronisms.  Watch the characters and the action.  Both are good.
B005KCGIUY|3.0|I really like most of MJK's work, but I cannot find an uncensored version of this album anywhere. I would rate this a 5 but I can't, because the censoring nearly ruins some of the best songs on this album. I would return the CD (I bought that thinking that only the digital version was censored - it's not), but I'll just hope my money went to supporting more music like this.<br /><br />That said, I do quite enjoy this album, reminds me a lot of A Perfect Circle, which is good in my book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The Crossfire series has it all: sizzling love scenes, fascinating characters, and an irresistible plot. If you loved Fifty Shades but find most other contemporary romance a little lackluster by comparison, the Crossfire series is what you're looking for. Can't wait for the exciting conclusion in May!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very interesting read, flowed well.  Inspiring strength of the<br />human spirit,  will and  hope.Religiously diverse and informative of the survival of animals.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I enjoyed this book while reading it - it's erotic, romantic, and has appealing characters. But when I finished, I felt a little dirty. It wasn't that the material was particularly explicit, it was that the characters were in an unhealthy relationship, but the author had constructed the story so that you were cheering for them to end up in that mutually-detrimental codependent state. I felt complicit in their misfortune and that feeling overshadowed all of the good aspects of the book.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I watched this again to create the flow needed to watch Taken 2 properly. I'm glad I did. It is a fantastic story and Taken 2 starts right up. It felt like they continued filming Taken 2 at the same time as Taken. I love the story and the characters. Liam Neeson carries the part off flawlessly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you're a fan of contemporary romance, you won't be disappointed with Hopeless. The plot is carefully constructed to include several surprising twists that don't stretch the bounds of credulity overmuch. Even though the characters are in high school, this is a sophisticated love story that will stay with you for a long time.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|If your into big budget b-style movies this ones for you. I absolutely loved this flick the first time i watched so after getting my 3d tv this was a no brainer for me. Great cars, hot girl and plenty of 3d action.....what else does a guy need.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This was a great book set.  I purchased the electronic version for Kindle and could not hardly put them down.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I want to rate the game a 5, but i cant even pull up the game, it tries but I end up back at the carousel , it started doing it slow with just one friend but now crashes all the time
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I like Seth MacFarLane and I like his movie.<br />Great jokes and humor.<br />If you are easily offended, don't watch this movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really like Pinterest and love being able to easily access it from my Kindle Fire. This app is pretty user-friendly.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics and story line was pretty interesting. Had a small issue with freezing but it is fixed now. I liked playing this game so much I got the full version.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|This is a good, fun permutation of the classic frankenstein plot.  We enjoyed it a lot.  I recommend watching/renting it.  However, I regret paying the extra $1 for HD.  This is a *black*and*white* animated movie, and the animation is less detailed than some of his other films.  The only thing actually high-def was the Disney intro reel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it is a real time passer I have all the apps made by angry birds yayyy its great
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It has been a long time since I have read a book I just couldn't put down and hated for it to end. Big Thanks to the author...In great anticipation of your next book/books.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Anyone with a red room of pain, I will always steer clear from!  I did get the hype on this book, though it was fun to discuss in lur book club with half of us feeling it was ridiculous and the other half really enjoying it.  I did not move past this book in the serious, it was just not for me.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|I love this movie being a star wars lover and all and i just laugh at it all the time. I don't know why but its funny at times

B00APUQRPC|2.0|I like baseball movies and unfortunately this one had it's own trouble with the curve.  If you have no other choices and you want the male version of a rom /com - this might be it.  Good actors, bad writing.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Although it is not much different than other Solitaire games, it never crashed on me.
B00008G7UF|5.0|A cute movie that we've adored for years. Glad to have on DVD. A Lighthearted and fun movie for the romantic. Enjoy with some French wine and cheese. (only if you are not lactose intolerant, that is.)
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini-series is probably my favorite of all time.  It is so real, you feel as if you are there.  A great tribute to our greatest generation and their legacy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't keep this book down! Totally unexpected outcome a real enjoyable read would recommend. So passionate best 1st kiss ever.
B000JMKO0A|5.0|I can honestly say this has become one of my favourite books. It spoke about very relevant subjects that we all deal with on a day to day basis.
B003I55BIA|5.0|Enjoyed this book and was happy to see Brittany fight for what she wanted even though their were so many obstacles in her way.  1st time I read a book written by this author and already purchasing more because this was such a good read.
B009IJJ5B4|3.0|Elemntary is by no means a 5 star television series but it is gaining altitude. The caliber of the episodes throughout the season has been fairly consistent with some good plot twists and solid dramatic elements. I also feel that there is good chemistry between the characters and the stories are about as original as they can be given that we have been numbed by the countless variations on murder and mayhem thrown at us by CSI, NCIS, Law and Order, et al.<br />I am a fan of Jonny Lee Miller who brings a level of intensity to the show with his quick wit and cold reality. He makes a good Sherlock Holmes in this new twist on the age old classic genius investigator. Lucy Lui is also a great twist on the original character of Watson for obvious reasons... and if you don't know then comparing the old and the new is irrelevant. I am also a big fan of lucy who seems to be able to hold her own whether it is the intellectual doctor type or the cat-like vixen. I think she is capable of more but do not feel we have seen her full potential yet.<br />All in all... Elementary is worth the watch for those that like the 'who dunnit' genre. I don't think you will be dissappointed.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good Bourne movie, like Jeremy and Rachel chemistry.  Outstanding views and music as usual.  As good as the others..  Worth watching.
B0085YNML2|4.0|i tried the free version, but I wanted to keep on going with the fun so i waited till it was free. Once it was free i got it and so far the mind challenges are super fun.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|Not that good.  Confirmed that I don't find NP that good an actress.  Story and plot a little scary and not in a good way.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|i love the songs and they made Christmas song sound so awesome. i felt like i was an expert on a real piano.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|Amazing that the \\"best horror movie of 2012\\" title should be between two animated films: Paranorman and Frankenweenie.  Both have a love for the genre and some scares that no other film in 2012, even the R-rated films, had.<br /><br />Frankenweenie may be the best Tim Burton movie since Sleepy Hollow.  It features awesome characters, superb black and white claymation, several homages to classic horror, and a heartwarming bond with a lovable dog.  My wife cried at the end of the film, and I can't say I wasn't trying to hold back tears myself.  Great movie!<br /><br />For genre lovers, references I caught in the movie include Dracula, The Creature From the Black Lagoon, Gamera, Vincent Price, Village of the Damned (my favorite one!) and of course Frankenstein.  I'm sure there were many others.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This piano app has been fun and kinda easy atleast to some of my friends and family who know how to work it. All I need now is to learn how to work with this piano notes.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun to play....has more different types of hidden objects styles than other games. Keeps you guessing and more mystery!! Great challenges....love it.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|videos were good in sound but terrible in picture. The music videos kept on freezing and sometimes it would stop,  so i deleted it off my device.
1465001123|5.0|Beautiful pictures and colors. This is the perfect calendar for any T-swift fan! You will not be disappointed, mark my words.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addictive. It is way better than temple run because you swipe your finger so now you can be in any position you want and still be able to play this game easily.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Despite the fact that most people heard (1) nothing about the movie (2) something about the movie, but had no clue what it was about or (3) bad reviews of the movie, it is a GREAT movie.  The John Carter of Mars series of stories was begun over 100 years ago and it took THAT long for the technology to catch up to Edgar Rice Burroughs' imagination so that the movie could be made.  Burroughs' stories fueled generations of scifi writers and scientists and this movie does an admirable job of bringing this story to the big screen.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch does a great job playing John Carter, and Lynn Collins as Deja Thoris (a Princess of Mars) is right up there with Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Alice (Milla Jovovich) as one of the baddest and hottest scifi heroines in history.<br /><br />It's a great story (and there is a STORY unlike quite a few scifi movies), great acting, great special effects, heroic adventure, romance, and a smoking hot sword-wielding heroine.  What more could you ask for in a movie?
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|this movie is the bomb. It was totally worth my money. Merida is so tomboyish and expressive about her thoughts. her look at the world is true for some people. Her brothers are so freaken funny. This movie was so touching at the end.
6302886228|4.0|This excellent video shows Dylan surrounded by some of his closest friends and musical collaborators over his first 30 years as a recording artist. Most songs are done very well, thanks to the artist and the top-notch backup band. Too many highlights to mention, but some of my favorites are Stevie Wonder doing 'Blowing in the Wind' in a soulful ballad, Eric Clapton doing some incredible guitar work on &#34;Love Minus zero-no limit' and &#34;Don't think twice it's allright', and the song  with Dylan, 'My back pages' where Clapton, Neil Young, Tom Petty and others do guitar solos. Some tracks for the original concert are deleted, such as George Harrison's &#34; If not for you&#34;, which is a a shame. Otherwise it's a unique opportunity to see some great artists all together doing Dylan songs.
B0081FO2Q4|4.0|It's a really nice album. Great singer-songwriter. Love the single &#34;A Team!&#34; Would buy more from Ed Sheeran most definitely!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!! Plot takes a good twist, and it's more then just a literate porno, there's love, adventure, romance, money....who could ask for anything more?
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love, love, love this album! Great price. Feel like I under paid for it! Great band. Everyone should listen to the Lumineers!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|If you like nova's,  this is a pretty cool one.  A lot fun. playing and hours on end of gameplay.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|I was excited about this film after seeing the previews. After watching it for 40 minutes, I had to turn it off, because there was no reason for to continue to finish this movie. All of funny parts must have been in the previews! I only maybe saw one of these funny parts in the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie. See it if your curious. Otherwise if you are looking for a hilarious comedy like Bridesmaids look elsewhere, because this pales in comparison to Bridesmaids!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The best feature of this app is its flexibility. It allows you to layer different sounds at different volumes to customize the ambient sound that fits your mood or situation.
B0034G4P26|3.0|Movie was not funny!  Only purchased it as I thought it would be as good as Chicken Run but it was not.  I will read the reviews the next time!
B0095R64AO|3.0|Movie overall was alright, there were some funny parts and the ending made up for it dragging along in the middle. I probably won't watch it again, but it wasn't a waste of time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I usually don't like bloody shows, that aside I am addicted to this story line. I think that is part of the intrige of the series,  the intra lacing of &#34;TRUTHS&#34; in how society would act, in such an tragedy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Highly recommended game for horse lovers. The graphics are great. Fun and addicting! Wish there were more horse breeds to chose from.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Well now I have to read the last book to see how it all ends. Different though,but still young lovers in turmoil
B000ICZD5M|4.0|The movie retains most of the original story. It was fun to watch, and learn that I was correctly pronouncing the names from the book.
1250007208|5.0|I really think my dog and I are the only ones who didn't read Cinder, the stunning and original debut by Marissa Meyer that blew up the YA world last year. A lot of times when a book generates that much hype I tend to shy away from it. The only plus side is that I now have a short wait to the sequel because I probably would have been committed if I had to wait 13 months for the next installment in this series.<br /><br />I have always been a fan of fairy tales, but the retellings can be so hit or miss. Taking the age old tale of the little cinder girl (aka Cinderella) and making her a cyborg was sheer genius. I was a little worried that Cinder was all robot, but thankfully that wasn't the case. I absolutely loved Cinder--she was heartbreakingly vulnerable one moment and then snarky and witty the next. She's such a selfless heroine, routinely risking her own happiness and life to protect those she cares for. This girl is everything you could want in a heroine and a narrator.<br /><br />I'm still not sure how I feel about Kai. There were moments I was swooning along with the girls of New Beijing and others where I felt like I just wanted more. I can appreciate that he's very much a boy becoming a man and trying to figure out how that works while the world watches. His position is not an enviable one, and I'm excited to see where Meyer takes this character in the next books.<br /><br />The world building Meyer employs blew me away. I love how she managed to construct this fictional world of New Beijing (of the entire Earth and Moon, really) so that it wasn't all that unbelievable. I don't know if anyone else could blend together the dystopian, science fiction, and fantasy genres to seamlessly. She made it look easy and it's a world I could routinely sink into.<br /><br />If you've been on the bubble about Cinder, grab it now. The sequel, Scarlett, comes out next month so you won't have long to wait. You'll only pull out half the hair on your head in anticipation.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a good game to pass the time if you like animals. good variety of things to keep you interested
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The hunger games was really  a padge turner.<br /><br />3 rd book is not the best overal<br /><br />!!!!!!!! grate hunger games!  you cant put it down
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Really fun game of course. I really like the different modes it has and the tournament is really fun to play.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Bought this for my wife for her B-day.  She loves it.  And it's much easier to get an electronic book and pack this thing full of them than it is to buy another bookcase and slowly fill it up.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen once again captured me. Absolutely, funny and worth the read. Now, on to the next one...no seriously...on to the next one!!
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|A gorgeously, thrilling story of the strong bond between two sisters, Tess and Bee. Sister is packed with suspense, emotion and transformation. It tells a beautifully, heartbreaking story of each sister's life, their communication misfires and how each reflects on the other. Lovely story with an amazing twist.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It works very well its kool I use this app a lot and it's very good app to use to edit pics
B001HC8516|4.0|While I don't always agree with the &#34;theory&#34; behind this book, the practice of it--walk away from guys who are wishy-washy, that don't pick up the phone, that won't commit, etc.  Stop trying read minds or find secret clues or guess behavior--if they don't act like proper relationship material, they aren't.  I love that message and think every woman would be happier if they made it their new motto.
B001DUGOWY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Steinbeck really is my favourite writer. I'm glad all of his books are made available by Penguin for my Kindle Fire. Thank you, Penguin!
B001R60ESE|5.0|Never thought that I would enjoy a trumpet player so much. His guests are incredible especially Sting. If you have an ecclectic taste in music this is one not to be missed.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Great book which I'd really recommend.  I was really looking forward to reading it and it definately lived up to my expectations.  A great story with great characters.  I didn't want it to end!!
B007NESBK2|3.0|Sultry as ever and musically you cant fault it. At times it becomes a bit monotonous, so probably better as something in the background whilst entertaining rather than watching it from go to whoa.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I truly enjoyed this in the literary sense as well as a surprize ending as usual, but for some unknown reason I was not captivated by the characters. I have watched several movie versions of Pride and Predjudice on television and I can envision in my mind's eye what some of the characters look like. From Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier and those in most recent versions of this classic story. P.D. James captivates me in all her books in this as well but not the full 5 stars.
1449415881|5.0|I truly enjoy Scott Adams' humor through the eyes of his stoic character Dilbert. I look forward to the next day's three panels.
B008R5OKH4|5.0|Peter E&ouml;tv&ouml;s has been sadly neglected in the US concert halls though the is immensely popular in Europe.  The Los Angles Philharmonic just presented his Do Re Mi  (his second violin concerto) commissioned by the LA Phil with Midori offering a startlingly vigorous reading. And the audience response was so strong that many people are now eager to explore more of his works.  He is currently being celebrated in the city with a performance of his opera `Angels in America' and a contemporary music festival devoted to his works and his conducting.<br /><br />This recording is fresh and very exciting. According to Andrew Clements in the Guardian, `The violin concertos by Bart&oacute;k and Ligeti are two of the greatest of the 20th century, and in this two-disc set they frame another Hungarian concerto, Peter E&ouml;tv&ouml;s's Seven, which he composed in 2006 in memory of the seven astronauts who died in the 2003 space shuttle disaster. The work is dominated by the number seven, and the series of accompanied violin cadenzas that forms its first part is dedicated individually to the astronauts, though the elegiac purpose of it all only becomes really clear towards the end of the second part when the violin settles into a drawn-out lament. Patricia Kopatchinskaja is clearly an immensely able violinist, and she projects the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s with wonderful confidence, but her rather brittle style is better suited to the sparkling polyrhythms of Ligeti's work than to Bart&oacute;k's brand of neoclassicism, which sometimes seems to get short measure expressively, especially in the central set of variations.'<br /><br />E&ouml;tv&ouml;s conducts the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra and offers fine control of each of these three works and Kopatchinskala proves her position as one of the rising stars of the contemporary violin repertoire.  Grady Harp, January 13
B003UYUP58|5.0|Comprehensive, insightful, compelling, heart-wrenching.  Nonfiction that reads like fiction. A must for grasping an understanding of this scourge we still struggle to conquer.  Mukherjee writes with deep understanding and complete empathy for the victims of cancer. Superb.
B002OSY2T6|4.0|Great for an toddler who's learning how to crawl, or just to gnaw on once they catch the little bugger. Or, as it may be, throw into the corner once they figure out it's not that tasty :P
B0060AY6FO|4.0|This book was an interesting insight into the future lives of Elizabeth and Darcy and the rest of the Bennet family and all the characters of &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34;. Also adding several interesting characters of  the Pemberley Estate.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|Most of the episodes in the seasons 3, 4, and 6 did not play because of damaged CDs. I like the series but disappointed with the shipment.
0596009208|5.0|awesome book easy to follow. I Highly recommend it if you know some programming and want to learn JAvA programming.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|the story plot was fresh, fast paced and full of surprises. video feed was good. i would recommend it to anyone.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading the trilogy because of it's detail as well as the writers ability to keep you hooked on the story.<br /><br />An emotional story that pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you reach the last full stop.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Everything about this book was emotional, moving, and just phenomenal. Watching Charlie go through his first year was an emotional roller coaster. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
B0063IH60K|3.0|game is ok ... something to do when i have idle time and don't feel like reading or tv .. just so so
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I love games like this.  Similar to Nancy Drew PC games.  You find clues and move from room to room to solve puzzles and continue through the story.  This story line could be intense for young kids.
1419705849|5.0|This series is fully of hilarity. My son just can't get enough of these books. His older sister picked up one and now she can't wait for the next one either. Arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Engaging plot and fun puzzles.  I felt like I had to do too much backtracking that wasn't very intuitive, though.  Overall, a nice little diversion.  Looking forward to the sequel.
1423101499|5.0|This book was just right for my kids. Full of silliness and action to keep their attention. Easy to follow and challenging enough to keep them reading. Came quickly and in excellent condition.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|To me it was one of those books that you miss when finished. I loved the first part of the trilogy as well. Not only a great novel but also a history lesson. My mother always told me about the constant fear of speaking your mind in those days and the repercussions if you did. The book brought that home.
1423101502|5.0|My children got this as a last minute gift. They were so happy because they really wanted this series. So far they have liked them all and this was no exception. Very thrilling and full of suspense. Fun for both boys and girls.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Easy to use.  Worked just like I expected.  Good choice of alarm tones.  I was in a hurry for an alarm away from home and this was a good choice.
0439023521|5.0|My son needed this book for college, but as long as we have it, I will get around to reading it after seeing the movie.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This is a great game and is fun to play.  It's also a good design game for people who love to build
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Loved this book! Cheryl Strayed writes well to say the least and you can really feel the emotion in her personal story!<br />Love reading about great adventures which this certainly was.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|suspenseful with a very good focus on detail regarding the costumes and location.  Recommended for those seeking action and historical content.
034580404X|5.0|What can I say, I loved the books, and I couldn't put them down.  I will probably end up reading them again just to see if I missed anything lol
0345529057|5.0|Don't know much about this series, all I know is that I bought for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he couldn't wait to read them
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I love everything about this game: the snappy background music, the silly sounds the pudding makes, the colorful visual variety, and especailly the clever gameplay.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have so enjoyed the story line in the series, can't wait to see the whole season.  From the beginning of Season 1 I was hooked.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I think this cd is so good. it has ballads and upbeat songs which I love in a cd. I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes pop music, and to those Bruno Mars fans, you will not be disappointed
B005H29GSI|5.0|Excelente producto y compra muy claro todo y la entrega fue bastante rapida, recomendable al 100% y espero comprar nuevamente
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this to use on a nice knife that I had gotten as a gift and was starting to get a bit dull.  I then promptly broke that knife.  However I have since used it to sharpen small swiss army knifes and large kitchen knifes and it was worked great on everything that I have tried with it.  I highly recommend this.
B00867GHS8|5.0|We purchased this for our 3D tv knowing it would be a great 3D adventure. We were not disappointed. From the minute the movie started we were in love.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am hooked on the whole series. This book had a lot of strong character development -I see their hearts.
B006H5120E|5.0|First we love this movie, and the 3D effects. However there could have been more 3D. We also purchased Finding Nemo and thought that was the better 3D experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have this on my phone and it is fun I think its like temple run almost expect with trains and griffitee
B00992CF6W|5.0|GET IT NOW U WONT REGRET IS ONE BIT!!!!!!!!! best best best best best best best best best game ever
0062235893|1.0|Saying that this is book is wrong on any level.  Approx. 1-2 padded cloth &#34;pages&#34; with very little text - no story at all!  All I can say it is good for is for gumming.  It says hardcover, but don't let that fool you; the only paper is the flimsy cardboard it comes in.  Not the classic we brought our children up with - very disappointed that I had to return.  A waste of my time.  I had to go elsewhere to find my grandson a replacement for his favorite book.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This app is fine. Nice updates. I don't know what people are talking about. when I do updates, it's just fine. This app is fine.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a washed up and depressed roughneck working in Arctic Alaska where he provides security to oil workers. The morose loner gets on a flight to head back home, presumably to his wife (Anne Openshaw), who we consistently see in the flashbacks and dreams of Ottway. Fate intervenes as the plane crashes in an icy tundra, and Ottway is one of several survivors. They team up to trek towards safety but Ottway's experience and survival instincts will be put to the test as they may be encroaching on the nest of a vicious pack of wolves.<br /><br />Disaster and survival movies are often some of the laziest potboilers in the film industry, but The Grey features an intelligently brooding script with fleshed out characters, superb performances, great stunts and sets, stark cinematography and a good measure of philosophy and poetry. There is a palpable quality to the film's setting. There is a really chilling realism to the film's atmosphere and I was really drawn in this adventure as this group of men flee the elements and the ravenous wolves. Speaking of, the one slight flaw in the film is the exaggerated and fictional characteristics of wolves. The otherwise outstanding script at one point claims that wolves are the only non-human species to seek revenge. Come on! Although to be fair, Joe Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers created a wonderful script.<br /><br />Early in the film, one of the heaviest and authentic death scenes in a film is shown as Neeson's Ottway consoles a man in the ruins of the plane crash who is close to death. This is an intense film; more so from the fears, dread, pain and inner struggles of the characters than the fight between man and nature. There are intelligent exchanges between the men as they sit fearfully around a campfire either confessing their fears and mortality or boasting a false bravado of fearlessness. The acting is solid across the board, but Neeson and Frank Grillo stand out in their performances. Grillo plays the token jerk of the survivors' group, at least at first, but his character has depth behind the sarcastic cynicism. In fact, all the characters are treated as their own person, not thrown together cliches or sacrificial lambs. Other films, particularly disaster or ensemble films, ought to take notice. Overall, The Grey is a forceful journey of existentialism, wonder and terror in a cold and unforgiving place where men find their own existences and meanings to be as transient as the snow under their feet.the token jerk of the survivors' group, at least at first, but his character has depth behind the sarcastic cynicism.

B003QP4NPE|4.0|I was initially hesitant to read this book as it struck me as a little cheesy.<br />I'm glad I read it, it was very entertaining.  This is the first work of fiction I've read that includes a MySQL injection attack, which was sort of surreal and awesome.<br />It's not great literature, but it's certainly worth a read - particularly if you're a techie<br />The sequel is worth reading for the conclusions, but Daemon is superior.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Wonderful book.  i do believe i have read almost every book the Michael Connelly has written and look forward to each new one.
B003YYKPMM|4.0|Everything was fine with this DVD.  The condition was sufficiently good.  Great movie about one of the major attractions on Route 66.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The plot of the book kept me wondering what would happen next. Events happened in the story that I didn't see coming.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A game that had many different puzzles to solve! Enjoyed it very much and my daughter thought it was cool to, she helped with some of the find it puzzles.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So, saving money on not paying for cable, but just b**$#in' internet, and then Netflix, I'm only missing out on one thing - the random, OCCASIONAL show I enjoy, and THIS FRIGGIN' AMAZING SHOW.  I absolutely love the comics, the few I've read so far, and the show not only is great in it's own right - it doesn't RELY on the comics.  There's definite differences, and hardcore fans probably argue either way, but I believe where this show goes different in its story is appropriate for the viewing audience, and still doesn't pull any punches.  What feels different in the show versus the comic seems to be done more for pacing, rather than truly changing the feeling.  Plus, Robert Kirkman is an executive producer, and seems to make sure everything is savvy to his original vision.<br /><br />And Season 3 definitely makes up for the lull that a lot of people found in Season 2.  Like, in the first episode.  You know how there's Super Mario Bros, and that was good, and then Super Mario Bros 2 (in the US) that was kinda, meh, different to fans of the first game, not bad, but just not the same, and then Super Mario Bros 3 that was like WOW EFF YEAH THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!! ?  There ya' go.<br /><br />No idea how Super Mario World fits into this analogy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book was intriguing and thought provoking. I was happy with the way the book ended; it did not make me wish for the way things might have been
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Really  enjoy this game. It is entertaining without requiring too much concentration. It is perfect for playing while listening to music or audiobooks.
B0065FFMR0|1.0|I love watching horror movies, but this shook me down to the core.  Spoilers: The fact that evil was in the form of a girl with down syndrome was upsetting.  The most disturbing thing was the character of the young teen who wanted to shoot up his school, even more so though was the psychiatrist's  daughter's falling for this disturbed young teen.  I would definitely avoid this show cause it will plant disturbing things in your mind, you won't be missing much at all just saved from seeing these psychotic people.
0765325950|1.0|First off, I'm not a fan of Brandon Sanderson. Robert Jordan wasn't an amazing author, but Sanderson's works tend to be teenage fanfic level, and whatever criticisms I had toward Jordan considering his depiction of female characters, Sanderson makes me think his only knowledge of women come from reading message boards. So, I was never all that pleased when Sanderson was chosen to finish a series I started reading when I was 10 years old (it's crazy as I realize how this series has been with me through most of my life).<br /><br />I'll start with the bad, and end with the good.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />1) So many loose ends. I don't know if this is simply because Sanderson never bothered to really read the existing novels, or he just blatantly ignored many plot points that had slowly evolved over decades, but he seemed to derive more joy out of putting his own stamp on how things ended, rather than doing his best to end the story as Jordan would have intended.<br /><br />2) So much character trivialization. After decades following our Two River's folk as they progressed along the path from farmers to heroes, it was utterly depressing to see people like Nynaeve completely trivialized at the end. I could probably write a novel alone on the characters who were trivialized or completely sidelined for MoL. And, what was the point of Moiraine being re-found if she'd play about two page's worth of a part in the entirety of MoL?<br /><br />3) Perrin and Faile. This criticism isn't solely for MoL, but for the direction Sanderson took with Perrin, once he took over. I suppose one could argue about Min's viewing concerning what most readers long assumed was Faile and Berelain and Perrin. It's hard to argue that it seems Sanderson never even bothered to read the viewing, or decided it was unimportant. Oh, and you can throw Berelain into the very huge pile of long-time characters who were completely trivialized in MoL. Actually, this goes into all of Min's visions, and how Sanderson really didn't seem to bother to spend the time to go over them all to make sure they were all incorporated into the story.<br /><br />4) Bashere and Rhuarc? Really? More signs, as far as I'm concerned, that Sanderson was more interested in putting his own stamp on the series, rather than being an actual custodian for ending it.<br /><br />5) Mat and the Redarms. More disrespect for tradition, keeping Mat and the Redarms seperated. Sure, Mat has to become the general for the Last Battle, but I can't be the only one who finds it distasteful that he ends up leaning on the Seanchan as his bosom buddies, rather than his Redarms, who he largely ignored throughout the entire book.<br /><br />6) That ending. Just horrible, horrible, ending, with zero closure. Yes, Sanderson, we all know you have your own 10-book series you want to work on, but no one forced you (I presume, at least), to take the job of closing out the WoT. I was 10 years old when I first started reading this series, in the 80s. That kind of emotional investment that a series creates, after having run since 1984, deserves a far better ending than the incredibly flippant and completely juvenile ending we received.<br /><br />7) Demandred. What a joke.<br /><br />8) Rest of the Forsaken. Granted, neither author did much of a job showing how horrific they were (and, to Sanderson's credit, his complete destruction of characters like Bashere and Rhuarc are about the closest thing to the Forsaken actually doing anything remotely unpleasant in the entire series), but it was still depressing to not see a single Forsaken re-claimed from the Dark One.<br /><br />9) Actually, I'm going to end the bad there. It's just utterly depressing at how poorly this epic series finished, and I don't want to wallow in it any longer. Plus, I suspect I'd reach Amazon's character limit for reviews.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1) As bad and disrespectful I've found Sanderson to be towards the WoT, I suppose it'd have been evenworse if we'd had no books at all once Jordan died. That's about the only good thing I can say about this book, from a gun-held-to-my-head-must-find-something-positive-to-say point of view.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I enjoyed the game so far...<br />it has good pacing and storylines. I will have to play more to see if it indeed deserves all four stars.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very good book.  Kept me intrigued<br />Good story line.  Wish there was more.  Waiting for movie.  Should be good if it follows book.
B001HN697M|5.0|I thought this was the best of the movie series...  It was great to see how it all began.  Excellent choice
B004LWZWGA|1.0|I realize that I may be in the minority here, but it is my review.  I am a longtime Batman fan and from the Pittsburgh area, so I expected so much more from this movie.  The only parts of this movie that had any value to me were the scenes without Bruce Wayne or Batman.  Loved Catwoman, Commissioner Gordon, and even Bane (and I expected to hate his character based on casting and other changes to the character).  I bought it, watched it, and gave it away.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I have quickly become a fan of this series, and enjoy the characters and trials they face. This book was long, but if this one is any testament to the rest of the series, I can't wait to pick up the next one.
1435114949|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to find this book in hardback... but the cost was extremely high. As I looked around on Amazon, not only did I find the complete series, I found this beautiful book at a great price! I bought TWO -one for each of my daughters. They became fascinated with the character Sherlock Holmes after watching movies. \\"The book is always better...\\" so we got these. They were happy with the collection & even more in awe of the beauty of the actual book! Fantastic quality!
075669812X|5.0|My grandson my grandsons attention for a long time he loves legos I would buy again a recommend this to a friend
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Avatar was a great movie when it first came out in 2-D, but in 3-D it is really amazing. If you don't have it you better get it now!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|What up with the mushrooms having to be in shade and I think this app deserves an update don't you I mean seriously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00065JTBA|5.0|I bought it for my teenager  and she was positivly shocked with amount of music on one places. I recommend this set to all Bon Jovi fans!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The book was excellent. The author communicated the girl's emotions wonderfully. I had difficulty putting the book down until I was finished
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|good for all ages. great story and good plot even for adults. my kids loved it so much we bought this instead of renting
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is very fun. It has a good picture and I really like the camera feature.
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I don't think there are any words that can describe how utterly horrible this movie is but I'll try. I normally keep my comments to myself about most things but for the good of mankind I felt it necessary to warn the world about this movie. It is absolute torture to watch. It truly is that bad. You know the name of that brown stuff you flush down the toilet? That's what this movie is.
B002DQFHKM|5.0|This sound track made the movie and is great by its self. A must for anyone that is interested in 80's hard rock.
B008SVS0K0|5.0|I accidentally discovered Billy Talent and have been a huge fan ever since. I love all their music and their latest is another great album. I listen to them when I'm working out, driving and working. Great band, great music. I strongly recommend them to anyone who likes great rock with a twist.
B009GXHOW4|4.0|it was great at first but the it stopped working altogether and I also wish that you could have armorial and spawn mobs on the free version.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is cute and fun. Great for younger kids and older ones. I have an Aunt who plays this game as well. It gets a little hard- well, difficult to accomplish much when you run out of money. Otherwise if you have younger children or relatives, they tend to become fascinated by how many pets you have and what you do with them.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What's not to like?  The music, the cast, the wardrobe, the story!!!<br />And Maggie Smith looks just like my grandmother, character has similar mannerisms as well.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|awesome for any pop music fan or Kelly Clarkson fan!!! great for any age with awesome songs. recommended to ANYONE
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game ever. Creative mode you can build your own house and land. The spiders,skeletons with bows, and green aliens that blow up. On survival you still get to build your own house. At night the giant spiders,skeletons with bows, and green aliens do come out.
B001TM14VC|1.0|the movie stopped halfway thru and wouldn't play the rest of the way. the movie itself is great but would have like to finish the movie.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is a must watch at Christmas time, love the humor and it has become a classic to watch in my household around the holidays.
0446364495|3.0|... and if you are in the latter category, you might also be a bit ashamed that you read it... even though it is billed as the largest selling hard-back novel ever. Well, I'm not ashamed, even though it is a schmaltzy, highly improbable tale. The book was published in 1992, and I read it only a few years thereafter. Thanks to the movie, with Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, if not the book itself, many people are already familiar with the essential story. It concerns two people in deepening middle age, with regrets about life somehow passing them by. Robert Kincaid, 52, is a \\"world class\\" photographer, decked out in Nikons, hired by the authority, National Geographic, to capture the covered bridges of Madison County, which is located in the heartland of the heartland, Iowa. Kincaid is every woman's dream, well, sorta; mainly he is gloriously unencumbered, yet deeply sensitive. Francesca Johnson, 45, IS encumbered, with a husband, and a couple of kids, who have momentarily absented themselves to the Iowa State Fair. The stage is set for one of life's \\"what ifs,\\" as in, could I have been happier having taken another path... and can I just test it, in terms of an ever-so-brief fling?<br /><br />Should the novel come with one of those warning labels, like you see on TV, in regards to a dangerous stunt: \\"Warning, don't try this at home\\"?! The guy isn't really going to be as great and sensitive as you think Francesca, if your fling extended out for just a month. The feet of clay would soon appear. Not to mention the breaking wind part. But still, as the Bible said, well, sorta, who amongst us has not had such a fantasy... and who amongst us has not dabbled at fulfillment?  In all its schmaltziness, it does touch a nerve in the human condition; mainly, I suppose for women, but also for men who fancy themselves providing a little joy...<br /><br />Fascinating also are the reviews at Amazon. At the USA site, as of this writing, they go to extremes, with the vast majority almost perfectly divided between five stars and one. Wonder if that unscientific sample could extend to the whole population? Let me enjoy this heartwarming fantasy / fulfillment vs. all those realists out there denouncing a made-for Hollywood con.<br /><br />I'll \\"triangulate\\" my rating to 3-stars. It is not the real world, but it is worth the read because a lot of people would like the opportunity to grab for that \\"brass ring\\" one more time when it comes around. The true challenge remains: what happens when both Robert AND Francesca are unencumbered? Can they try it again, at home?ost perfectly divided between five stars and one.

B000FCKC4C|2.0|Unfortunately, after purchasing this and getting further into the book I discovered the interesting setting for the story suddenly became of very little importance as the author started very blatantly preaching typical 'self-help' advice to the reader. I realize this book comes highly recommended, so it just doesn't line up with my taste. If you also find this sort of writing bothersome I would recommend saving your money.
B00275EGWY|5.0|This is the kind of war our kids will be seeing for the next 50 years. Obviously, it's a good movie: 6 academy awards and best picture. But the most powerful take away for me is that my kids will experience this kind or warfare...fanatics, suicide bombers, religious nuts, and everywhere. The battlefield is everywhere with no limits. Not decisive but a continuing and slow rot. And, our leaders will not confront it on a large scale, so we're left with this.<br /><br />The movie shows the future very well.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Having all of Garth Brooks' greatest hits for this price is absolutely amazing. You can't buy his songs on iTunes so this was the best!
B007N3GZ9C|4.0|This book will forever change how you think about how you think and experience the world.<br /><br />Not to mention it will give you incredible insight into the inner world of a stroke victim and how to help.<br /><br />You will learn things about the way your brain works that will surprise you and provide food for thought for years.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picoult is an awesome writer and all of her books I read bring me to tears. I finished the book in a day and could not put it down.
0425252868|5.0|What an amazing story this is! I work at a book store and started getting requests for this book so thought I'd see what it was all about. After reading the synopsis it sounded so interesting I thought I'd give it a shot. It is now one of my all time favorite books. The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, my heart rate went up, and it was like I could smell the gas, oil, smoke, and fear. It tells the stories of a German fighter pilot and an American bomber pilot in WWII, from how they were both raised to why they made the choices they made. Their adventures and the horrors of war, and after, when they meet again. This is a wonderful story of courage, hope, and forgiveness.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A must read for everyone! I would give it 10 stars! Moved  me greatly. I plan on buying copies to give to friends.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I got it for free at first then the trial ran out. It was really good already. Games like this are fun; it had the right amount of suspense to make it interesting. It reminds me of Bioshock ( I didn't play it for almost a year because it scared the poop out of me). This  is the best game of this kind that I have played so far.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|The other day, I walked by a defunct restaurant in my neighborhood that's been closed for months but is still intact. Inside, there were a pair of camping lanterns on the reception desk, their boxes hastily discarded on a nearby table. Presumably the owner needed a way to light the place at night without electricity. That scene reminded me of Wool 1-5 and the mood of the series, a feeling I could identify immediately but would be hard pressed to put into words.<br /><br />It took Hugh Howey five books, or a good part of that, to construct that ineffable mood. Wool 1-5 has some shortcomings in plot and character development, but it succeeds where few works of fiction do in creating a world that's not only well described but deeply felt. Howey's writing is visceral, conjuring the sights, sounds, textures and smells of the strange yet familiar world where his stories take place. The setting is as completely absorbing as it is repulsive.<br /><br />The stories are not always as deep as the world in which they take place. The villains and heroes sometimes lack a greater nuance and moral complexity that could have made Wool 1-5 a genuinely profound work. That said, most of the characters are complicated and interesting enough to drive the story. And though some of the story developments felt superfluous or overblown to me, there are different types of action in the books that will suit the tastes of different readers. Throughout the five books, I was almost always eager to pick up Wool 1-5 and find out what happened next.<br /><br />Wool 1-5 is an engrossing work of apocalyptic sci-fi that speaks in subtle ways to our own modern lives: Our flaws, our strengths, our comforts, our habits, and our sometimes willful ignorance. It's time well invested for some powerful impressions that may stick with you for a long time.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I would recommend watching this film. I especially liked the ending. It appear to leaving an opening for another film
0425252868|5.0|Unlike most war stories, this one begins with a disclaimer that the author did not want to write this book. That is, he intended to pen a biography of a noble allied hero bombing the daylights out of hated Nazi Germany.  Instead, he discovered a noble Knight of the air flying against the Allies, but having a heart of compassion and following the rules of war.<br /><br />This book is compelling and thought provoking.  The humanity of war is rediscovered, as well as the realization that there just might be good guys in the bad guys camp.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I watched this movie myself and truly loved it. Definitely one I want to watch for many years to come.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Interesting quaint mystery.  This has some more novel attributes for a mystery series applying a little too much description in surroundings rather than in the suspense.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I never know how he remakes will be so I unwrapped this movie and watched it myself before giving it to my neice for Christmas. Now I want one for myself. Very well done. I loved this movie as a child and I love the remake. I would recommend this to anyone.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian Rankin brings John Rebus back to work on the cold case squad.  A conceit also used by Michael Connelly in his wonderful Harry Bosch series.  And it works well.  The dialog is crisp, the characters well drawn.  There is an excellent plot with some nifty twists and turns.  And best of all we're left with a near certainty that there will be another Rebus novel in the offing.  Well worth the time and money.  If you haven't read the rest of Rankin's Rebus novels, you're in for a treat.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|the game is good is awsome her fun Multics player<br />I love how they have a update ever week wow that is awsome
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I have heard a lot of great things about this movie and I couldnt wait to see it, It started out great and kept getting better, until his future self was there then it kind of got messy in my opinion, Worth the 3.99 but that is about it i guess
B004SBULWE|4.0|This app is simple, but if all you need is a task killer it is perfect. I basically use it to reset netflix on my kindle when it acts up
1452111014|5.0|I love getting the art books for movies I really love, as an animation student, and fan of the movie I couldn't wait to have this in my collection. I was a bit let down with the art book for Brave but this book has everything I love in an art book: I LOT OF DRAWINGS!
B006O6F932|1.0|Very disappointing. I bought it for my 5 year old for Christmas. She loves Monster high. Its falls apart when she plays and shes not that rough either. Not sturdy at all.  Your better off just buying the dolls and the vanity set.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Fun game, though it can sometime  feel repetitive, and needs more diversity with the disease types so that the strategies employed are more distinct.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Wife's friend recently lost this CD.  One of my wife's favorites so had to get it replaced for her!  A lot of great songs and just relaxing to listen to.
B00ARN0WBW|4.0|It had its moments. People who gave it a bad review should understand that this is the 4th film, what did they expect. I recommend this movie to those who get scared easily, not that many scary scenes.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book holds your attention okay,its just a little to predictable for my taste I like books with a little more ,keep me guessing,kinda thing..
B0094BB4TW|1.0|First my newsfeed refused to load. Now I can't even sign in. Worthless since the update. Deleting this (now)bloat app and may not reinstall after problems are addressed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So many crazy twists and absolutely my favorite so far. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series.
B0037B6QSY|3.0|I honestly don't understand why this book is a best-seller. It contains the same information that you find in many other books on meditation or mindfulness. It tells you about meditation in different traditions, such as Buddhism or Yoga, and distinguishes meditation from those traditions, emphasizing its benefits. The author, however, offers very superficial recommendations on how readers can make meditation useful in their lives. If you're like me and want something you can use, then read the book Secret Techniques for Controlling Sadness, Anger, Fear, Anxiety, and Other Emotions by Vlad Koros. While Koros doesn't talk about meditation per se, his book focuses on the somatic experiences (description of which is amazingly nuanced and precise) that you feel during meditation and on specific techniques for regulation of those experiences. Secret Techniques, unlike Wherever You Go, There You Are, is very practical and both of these books are fun to read.
0425252868|4.0|i chose this rating  because  I am a member of the  greatest  generation  .  I  knew one of the  men  who<br />was  on the mission and  the book  brings  to life with great vividness  the finest hour of these. beautiful  young<br />knights of the sky.  Of  course,  the  theme of  story  portrays the character  of  the  German  pilot  who with<br />courage  and  compassion  followed the knightly code and spared  his helpless enemy.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I cose this game because I heard alot about it . I like the game it has alot of different levels.Its a big challenge to get those pigs especially with little birds. I would recommend this to anybody who likes a challenge.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|I like the cover the color is nice. It holds my kindle fire hd very tight it won't fall out. For the price it is a good buy.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This film has all the heartbreak, joy, and excellent music that any human could ever enjoy. If you simply contain a heart in your chest, you will love this movie. It will move you to tears. It will make you feel emotions you've never felt before. That's how powerful this movie is. So, if you're a robot cyborg who cannot feel emotion, this film is not for you. But if you have ever felt anything before, you're in luck! This movie is perfect for you.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had forgotten all the character background Hugo gives. It adds sooo much to the story. Justice meeting mercy is such and important theme.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Spinning circle forever.  Connected to internet.  Left it go for an hour.  nothing changed.  deleted and reinstalled.  demo played. back to spinning forever.  deleted forever.
B000KRMZA6|1.0|I have already seen this movie as I own a tape of it that I purchased years ago for a vcr. I would watch it with my son and nieces over and over. We enjoyed the movie so much that I decided I should just order a DVD of it and pass it down.  I have tried to play the movie in NUMEROUS DVDs and have not been able to enjoy watching it once yet! Every time I hit the &#34;play&#34; button, it says &#34;Playback prohibited by area limitations.&#34; I obviously payed $14 for nothing. I purchased three other DVDs when I bought this one and have enjoyed all of them, but I am disappointed in this one because it is a family favorite. It is not the movie itself I am disappointed in, it is the product.
0765325950|4.0|Spoiler Warnings!!!!<br /><br />I thought the book well done except for the end. One thing I didn't get,  was if Rand was covered by a Mist of Mirrors looking like Moridin when he road off, or was he actually inhabiting Moridin's body ?  If it was the latter then I'm very disappointed. I just don't like the idea of Rand not retaining his original body. Either way, I thought the ending was just too off the wall for me. Sorry RJ. Just not enough contemplation and retrospection. I think that was the trap of having to tailor everything to a pre-writ ending that could not be altered or modified as the book was fully developed and flushed out in order to honor RJ.  The other very disappointing aspect for me (though consistent with it's own premise established in the books) was I had hoped that the Wheel would be broken and end the depressing cyclic nature of existence destined to repeat itself and all it's horrors of meaningless deaths and lives.<br />  One other thing I thought lacked was proper homage to Egwene and her sacrifice. Just an off hand mention of a memorial by the Aes Sedai. One of my favorite characters amongst the girls. Very sad to see her die as well as other established names. Never have liked the heroes dying, but I'll admit it is more realistic and dramatic. Invokes more emotions.<br />  This probably sounds awfully negative and I apologize for that. I suppose with all these years of speculations and theorizing, that we all have constructed some vision of \\"our perfect ending.\\"  I think the series was awesome, but I will probably not be able to read it again due to the philosophy of the series not being in accord with my world view. All & all I thought A Memory of Light  a great epic finish except the very end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game rules and if you don't like it your SO STUPID!!!!This game rules and you can get a horse and you can name it and get yourself a username and play with your  friends and you can enter in competitions and maybe you can win!!!! :D

B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I love animal games and baby animals! So this game is perfect for my interests and spare time. I think my favorite animal is the elephant or giraffe.
1781163243|5.0|I love concept art books and buy many but they can be a little disappointing when their filled with pictures you could find browsing the internet.<br /><br /> If you like halo or sci fi concept art this book is great. Plenty of sketches and final illustrations.<br /><br /> Not really a negative, but I would love to see more information on the artist and what it took for them to create the image and  what they were trying to convey with their design.<br /><br /> The page material feels...... a bit cheaper than others I have experienced with the purchase of hard covers but for the price it was a &#34;no regret purchase&#34;.<br /><br />Dev
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game but it takes too much time to regenerate coins also I love all of the other games created by circus clown
B003EVWDR0|4.0|Avatar is a science fiction film, set in the 22nd century. The movie takes place in the far away land of Pandora, which is rich with a mineral called unobtanium. As miners pursue the opportunity to further explore the land and its precious stone, the territory of the indigenous people, the Na'Vi, becomes threatened. As the Na'Vi struggle to preserve their homeland, a war is waged that will force everyone to decide how much they are willing to sacrifice to get what they want.<br />Avatar is as visually stimulating as it is emotionally exhilarating. Writer and Director, James Cameron, has created a film that reaches out, grabs you, and pulls you into the screen. Pandora's beautiful landscape is filled with majestic creatures that are pure surprises to the eye. Yet, somehow, this mesmerizing land isn't distracting from the plot; the scenery only adds to your interest to follow the characters and engage with them.<br />Avatar is a great representation of the struggle between the indigenous people and the technologically advanced, even as it takes place in present day. The Na'Vi believe in a spiritual connection to nature, and go to great lengths to train in the ways of respecting the land, and ultimately pleasing their spiritual deity. The direct connection they feel with their land is what makes it so painful to have foreigners come into their space and try to push their own agendas. During the movie, you are torn between the interest in seeing the miners succeed in their ventures (surely the economic growth that could come from exploration of Pandora will create benefits for the whole world), and the desire to see respect for nature trump personal gain.<br />It is this same struggle that is occurring between global religions and the indigenous. There is a clash of culture that can be damaging, but if both groups will take the time to really \\"see each other\\" (a term used in the film to express seeing someone's soul), much can be gained from the exchange of knowledge and experience. The book \\"Living Religions\\" highlights the collaboration that has occurred between old and new ways, lending to such religions as Buddhism (8th ed, p.39). This is a great example of two cultures coming together rather than tearing each other down, as is depicted in Avatar.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|A sensitive overview of modern family life in America.  A very well researched courtroom drama and a good understanding of how young people relate to others and their expectations.  A good read.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|This game is ok for passing the time, but not enough to keep me interested.  I would recommed it for a younger audience.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Page turner !! Loved the way the author writes<br />It's like seeing it happen , so detailed !!<br />Can't wait to read the other two books.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This cover/stand works great for the Kindle fire hd.  It make using the tablet very easy and also serves as a great protector of the tablet surface.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again , love, loved the way EL James writes!!<br />Fell for the characters , even the music & songs she chose<br />Very right on., had some tears flowing....... This isn't about sex<br />But how we choose &#34;sex&#34; as other options too, to cope or just<br />Make our lives a little more interesting . I was there eavesdropping :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Would like to see red-letter versions like many print Bibles are available in. You can't have much better reading than God's word.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put down my kindle!  Great read!  I wish it kept going to tell the story of the main characters.
B007RTAR64|5.0|This doll is very nice and actually looks like the character. The outfit is good quality and, with a little imagination, the bow will actually shoot the arrows.
B008JGSM6G|1.0|this is horrible, everytime my grandson plays it and hits a button we are being charged.. This is a game that should not be on a kindle when they keep charging to you to got to next level. I deleted this
B003Y5H51K|4.0|This is a very good movie.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering \\"what else can posibly go wrong\\"!  Very well done, if you put yourself in their place.......
0316228532|5.0|I was enthralled by this book from start to finish. Rowling is a brilliant writer and deft at creating characters who feel so real, you actually miss them when the book is finished and want to know what happens next for them. Each character in this book is unique, and she gives each one depth and vividness. Some are hateful; some you root for. But each of them is real and complex. This book is not full of action, but rather is almost entirely character-driven. And yet I found it fast-paced, and I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Rowling's insights into the human condition are remarkable, and I hope she never stops writing.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This was an interesting story set in an interesting world. I found the first few chapters a little slow, but more because I grokked the setting and just wanted to get on with the story rather than any real problem with them. A fun page-turner. Looking forward to more from the author.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I was not sure about this movie, but my two sons love it.  The character Lorax is very funny, and will keep the kids glued to the TV for a good break time haha.  Anyways the movie also shares a good message
B002GHIPYI|5.0|Built solid, sounds great. Leaks sound a lot, though. Great overall value. I've never heard of this brand, but this is a great product.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Got this for my kids, and they love it.  They can see this movie over and over again.  It has great bright colors, and also a good message for kids that I love.  I also found myself watching, because its pretty funny...
0743270754|5.0|Am just getting time to read it but I know I will love it as it is by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick has definitely tooken this to a whole new level! I love Percy Jackson!! I am really excited and I am really looking forward to the next book!
B001HN6922|1.0|My two year old grandson loved it was glued to it and was taking in all the violence.  I personally did not like it as I could not relate to it at all.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Best one yet<br />Great book<br />I can not wait for next one.<br />Hope it is great like this one.<br />Worth the money
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Very thrilling and exciting movie. It worth a watch.  In this movie every one acted very well.  This is so true how people can be so low and will do anything for money.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a good logic game. I have bought almost all of these games. This game can be very easy on the 5 by 5 grid, and quite challenging on the 15 by15 grid. I find this game to be addicting, I look forward to finishing 1 puzzle and then starting the  next. This game comes with a good tutorial, in no time you'll be enjoying these puzzles.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King doesn't disappoint - good read!  I appreciate the twists & turns you come to expect from King - he's still real wordy... just saying.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|i liked the movie, being the one in the family that likes horror flicks. Ending was not what i expected!
B0064W652A|5.0|At the time of this review, a rich feeling of catharsis is literally pumping through my blood. The nuanced relationships that Batman's has forged over the years come crashing into one amazing book. This is a must for any comic fan, as well as anyone who is as enamored with the mythos of Batman as I am.
B003UESJH4|4.0|Gave to my over-90 in laws who also love the film; however, they had some difficulty with the profanity, which in our opinion was appropriate to the script.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3<br />Love this series - can't get enough of it! Well acted and beautifully filmed in England
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Such an interesting book. Never quite new what was about to happen when you turned the pages. And then the twist! Could not put it down. Looking forward to reading more of Kate Morton.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|Starts off slowly then gets even slower. What a boring ending for a Jack Reacher novel.<br />Very sad really. Very very boring.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Well, as the title says, I like this app but it's not as good as Angry Birds. :P (In my opinion) It's a good game, though. I haven't played it much, but I know someone who does and they love it. It's (obviously) from the pigs' point of view. You have to build carts that are stable so that pigs can go down a hill without crashing... That's probably the worst description in history, so I think you should just try it out yourself. You've got nothing to lose; it's free, and if you don't like it, you can always delete it later. And if you do [like it] than, well, you made a good purchase! Think of it as ripping the company off... XD Just kidding. Think of it however you will. :P :)
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Yes I am male and over 70 so I should have been more choosey with my selection.<br />I read it all fairly quickly. Not really me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book so much. I can not wait to read the next one!!!! Five four three two one...
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Very readable novel. Up to date with Edinburgh, Pitlochery, and North.<br />He is back with Rebus but the guy is definitely getting older.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is really cool. it is really addicting too. I love this game very much. I recommend you get it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Watch the first and second season on Netflix. Coudln't wait to watch the third. This season was more intense than the previous seasons, can't wait til February when it continues!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|wish it wouldn't freeze. hate that its not all free. like the graphics. its easy to play. my kids enjoy it too.
B0049EN064|1.0|Bought the DVD and it couldn't play in the United States.  The sell will not refund the DVD either.  They have a picture of a normal season cover when in fact the real cover of the season says that it is European.  Really shady if you ask me.  Got this for someone for Christmas and it backfired, plus the seller will accept the DVDs back but will not refund me.
B006BAEQB2|2.0|This book should be called fiction and not &#34;historical &#34; fiction. Where should one begin? Let me just make three points that I consider most blatantly inaccurate! Firstly, Richard and Anne did have marriage dispensation and thus lawfully wed. The parliamentary edict that Anne's land will belong to Richard if they divorce had a clause that Richard can hold those lands as long as he does not remarry. And make all necessary efforts should be made to remarry Anne. This was done to protect Anne's interest since Clarence was striving to declare their marriage illegal.<br />Secondly, the countess of Warwick was not held prisoner by either Richard and Anne. She was provided with an annual annuity and had freedom of movement. She was close to Edward of Middleham and was present when he died. It is said she was devastated by little Edward's death.<br />Thirdly, there is absolutely no evidence of any sort of liaison between Richard and Elizabeth of York. The rumors were spread by Tudors and denied publicly by Richard. As a matter of fact Richard was negotiating Elizabeth's marriage to Manual of Portugal at the time these rumors were circulated.<br />If you want to read a historical fiction on Richard III then read Sharon Penman's Sunne in Splendor and the difference between the caliber of that book compared to Kingmaker's daughter will be self evident.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has been my favorite band for years, and 10,000 Days is probably my favorite album by them.  I was heavily anticipating this album for years, and I can still remember how moving I found this album to be on its first listen.  If you buy this, do yourself a huge favor and read the lyrics.  Wings for Marie, Rosetta Stoned, and Right in Two will blow your mind.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would recommend this book to teens . It's wonderful and inspiring . It makes you think about the little things
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The story is told from the point of view of a freshman in high school and the changes and troubles of a person's life that you may or may not know. It's about inner battles and growing up. It deals with many issues facing teens today in a way that feels more real and truthful than most books about this age group.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I loved Gone Girl so much, so I had high hopes for Sharp Objects.  Unfortunately, the story was predictable and the characters were a bit contrived.  The relationships between the characters were just odd and unrealistic.  I was disappointed.
B0093X805W|4.0|Tjhe e reader version of the children's book was excellent and at first I did not think it would be better than hard copy but it worked well for my child.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|Up: The advertising hype was more than the movie.  The premise was good but the movie was disappointing for me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another incredible book from Stephen King.  I don't give many 5 star reviews, but this book was amazing!<br />Every free minute was dedicated to reading it.
B0000AC8LZ|1.0|I ordered the movie Office Space, but when I received it I had Happy Gilmore in an &#34;Office Space&#34; package. It was sealed and everything.  I was very disappointed in Amazon's service, in sending me the wrong movie!  Will not do that again!
B0079R8KXG|4.0|The kindle fire fits perfectly in this.  It looks nice and works great to prop it up to watch a movie.  Good basic case.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Bulletproof app on old crummy phone but crashing on new Galaxy S3, has left me without alarm several times. ??? Problems with fade-in volume?    UPDATE: I've not tried the fade-in volume any more, I suspect that was what was causing crashes. Besides that, this app is, as I mentioned, bulletproof. I used to use it for the math alarms, but now I've ditched that for the ability to play a playlist or artist from MP3s in memory. Coupled with a bluetooth bedside dock, I get to wake up to music of my choice at that surpasses both quality and volume of the built-in phone speaker. I've used this app for years now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I finished it in 1 day and can't wait for the movie to come out soon.
B002361MLA|5.0|When I was in college, I took a Human Sexuality class that opened my mind to all the various ways we experience sex.  Reading this book provided me the same epiphanies - about how we should experience life.  It's a good way to start off your quest in spirituality as well.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I loved this one I think it was the best of the 3 I would reccomend it to many people
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This is one of the best television programs of it's type. Suspenseful and interesting! Great character development and plot. Season one was great and season two is even better. The camera work and the set design are a treat for the eyes. Jessica Lange's performance is spectacular, as are all the actors in this series.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|What's not to like about this well-written fantasy about a young man learning about his &#34;peculiar&#34; abilities and tracing his grandfather's legacy.  There is time travel, adventure, suspense and cleverly used antique photos.  I recommend it and look forward to the next installment.
B009GEAWOU|4.0|I really like the character dynamic this show offers. It is fun and has good humor to it. Sometimes quirky and sometimes serious. There are a lot of running jokes throughout the series so I would recommend starting with season 1 and watching it in it's entirety.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|But this one did. My God, I feel as if John Green taught me something, taught us all something. Thank you.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! Lots of detail, twists and turns.  I've read his books before and have enjoyed all of them. Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If you were reading this because you were curious about the sex, then I guess its not bad. A literary great, it's not. Better writing than the first one thankfully, but it still seems to lag quite a bit and not much plot development. Most of that happens in the 3rd.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a very fun cute game that's hard to put down once started.  Lots of difficulty levels keeps the interest levels high.  Good graphics, lots of other little features to look at.  And the little candy eating monster is the cutest little guy...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|use it everyday. great features love that I can set multiple alarms. five stars. very easy to use and set up and great options. app has never crashed. kindle fire.
0553381407|5.0|Great book, this book breaks down abuse in small sections so its easy to understand. Also she uses examples of sessions so its easier to identify with others.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Great way to kill a few minutes of downtime at work. Liked it so well downloaded to both phone and kindle.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|As a collector of movies, my son was excited to received this selection. As a matter of fact, we watched a portion that I had  not<br />seened, and I was impressed at the action and the way it was directed. Keep carrying the favorites.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I  always  to  get  this  movie  collection  because  i'm  a  fan  of  Star  Trek  the  condition was  very  when  i  recieved  it  Amazon  was  good
B008JFUUIA|1.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  The dialog and songs are raunchy, the characters are depressing and nothing ever actually happens in the movie.  About 30 minutes into it, I realized Pitch &#34;Perfect&#34; was not going to get any better and left the room.  Other members of my family survived watching it to the end, but I honestly don't know how they stomached it!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I'm a fan of the Japanese game &quot;hanjie,&quot; and although it's not exactly the same it's enjoyable. I'm probably going to purchase more puzzles in the future.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't sure if the Hunger Games series was something I would be interested in but I loved them all.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is awesome.  I liked Season 1 and I love Season 2.  The characters are so likeable and the story lines are amazing.  Cool twist to your favorite story book characters.  :)
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I initially had a hard time keeping all names and places straight, but now I am hooked!  What a fantastic continuation of an already riveting saga.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a ton of fun and it really has AMAZING graphics!!! love it a lot. but I think it should be easier to get more ge.s but other than that It is perfect
B005LAII12|5.0|I've been a fan of Seth's since family guy. But now he is amazing . This movie has some good funny explicit content. But also has a romantic and sentimental side. In my opinion Ted is one of my favorite movies of all time.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this,I have it on my kindle.Ilike being able to quikly check the weather whenever I want to without waiting for the tv.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I loved watching Smallville, back while the series was running!<br /><br />And, I enjoyed adding this DVD package to my series collection!<br /><br />I was very impressed with the quality of it!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />God bless you and your family!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have a hard time moving them around,i'm not used to it being so small,I get really frustrated and stop playing,but I still keep trying.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|In these perilous economic times we have only to look back to find the same sad scenario. Steinbeck gave voice to a people and a time not unlike today. It is a story of overwhelming sadness redeemed by the courage and strength of the Joads who represented so many who actually lived it.
B001FXCE46|4.0|I originally just wanted to order \\"Closer\\" on mp3. However the collection of songs on this album I enjoyed so much that I purchased the entire album. Most albums today you are lucky if you get two great songs max. This is not the case with this album. You surely get your money's worth.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The book is such an inspiration.  I am telling all my friends to read it.  The author is beyond reproach in his believability.  What a treat.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|This is a great Mariah Christmas CD. I enjoyed listening to it during the holidays. It will be a part of my 2013 Christmas collection also.  I recommend this item.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|l loved it. The whole plot got me sucked in to the storie. I thought it was completly and utterly amazing.
0345803493|3.0|This book was much more enjoyable than the first book (the annoyances keep it in the same star range though). Ana and Christian are more endearing... their love more apparent, which -- of course -- makes the sex hotter. I'm still not a big fan of Ana (she's annoying and stupid half the time) but I was able to empathize at times and found myself tearing up as a result. I definitely approve of this Christian far more than the ass we met in book 1! *swoon*<br /><br />I still had issues with the writing, and the pace is just awful in this book. We keep rehashing the same crap over and over again. It's like being on a merry-go-round. If 90% of the redundancy is cut, this 500+ page book could easily be 150-200 pages! Oh, and looky-looky, another cliffhanger... (Ugh... hate those!!) So yeah, I was entertained at times and annoyed at times... like in the first. I only recommend if you can find it for cheap.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is Awesome, and I'm not sure, but it might help you with real horse riding! I hope you enjoy it!
0670026603|5.0|Being a best of the month book, I looked forward to reading this book. I admit I felt like it started slowly but I soon become enthralled with the characters and the plot.<br /><br />I am not a very emotional person and I do not tend to get teary-eyed but this book was an exception. Although I thought it would have a happy ending, it ended differently than I expected and I was surprised at the level of emotions it evoked. I found myself trying to read through the tears!
B000FBFMFW|4.0|Enjoyed the continuation of Assassin Aprentist as the life of Fitz Chivelry in his growth in the use of skill.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was way over-touted with the original 5 star rating and that’s why I bought it. I’m struggling through it and am about 65% complete and still waiting for it to take hold as a great book as advertized, Last time I buy Colleen Hoover.
B001F4UHEE|5.0|Awesome movie. Great filming and great script. Good story line, which is why i bought it. My doctor said I should watch it!
B00821PCJS|4.0|Big fan of Noah Wylie and he does a superb job in this show.  Lots of twists and moments that make you jump!  Can't wait for season 2!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I'm not a giant fan of Christmas music.  I'm not against it, either, but just not a fan.  Nor, before the past year, was I particularly in to acapella.  This album is both things and it is great.  I am particularly impressed by their version of &#34;Carol of the Bells&#34;.  What's more, I put this on my 4 year old's ipod and she plays &#34;Angels We Have Heard On High&#34; all the time.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and so was really looking forward to this movie.  There are some really interesting things that he's done and touched on in this movie.  A familiarity with the Alien films, particularly &#34;Alien&#34; and &#34;Aliens&#34; is really necessary to catch all the ways in which you can see Scott is playing with subject matter for which there is already a lot of canon, but a fair bit of it he doesn't agree with, maybe.  There are some great gems in the subtexts created by backgrounds of the characters, the android's choice of on whom to model himself, etc.<br /><br />On the other hand, a lot of the movie is messy as heck.  There is tons of exposition and just a lot of general ponderousness.  This is not a great film.
B009329ZF2|3.0|The movie was a fun action/ adventure type to watch. Entertaining. Girlfriend fighting aliens with vet was kind of cliche-ish. Again though, fun movie.
B005YPJ31I|5.0|It iis a wonderfully intelligent work by a terrific writer whom I have long admired.  I'm referring to Doris Kearns<br />Goodwin and  and her book, 'Team of Rivals'.<br /><br />  Sincerely, Julian Mazor
B00846TRHY|5.0|This movie tells the story of a preacher who is defending Christianity and severley persecuted Christians in the spirit of biblical Joshua. A must see movie and a must know about story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Awesome read! Twisting plot w/ a heartwarming story of love shattered, love lost, and true love triumphing! Can't wait for the movie!
B001GCUNYO|1.0|Took the Blu Ray out of the packaging and then put it in my PS3 to watch it, and after approx. 10 min my PS3 had not recognized that there was a disc inside it. I tested it out on my laptop which has a Blu Ray player and my laptop itself did not even recognize a disc inside the disc drive. All of my Blu Ray systems are up to date. This product had no chance of working.
B003JTHESA|4.0|This may be called the final frontier, but I hope this isn;t the final maiden album. I really am looking forward to the next.
B005K17RU0|3.0|It will do. It's a little difficult to change the default location and make it permanant. But it does serve it's purpose well enough. It is free, so like I stated in the beginning &quot; It will do.&quot;
B0086700CM|5.0|It is kinda hard but that just makes it even more fun when you complete a goal or get a highscore. I love it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I have done a bit of section hiking in Southern Missouri.  Even though it doesn't compare to this hike, I understand how being in the \\"wild\\" teaches you a lot about yourself...that there is a huge<br /> world out there beyond roads and the comforts of civilization.  Makes you take a step back and think about the relationships you have and the person you want to be in life..... I really enjoyed this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app for horse lover's. very realistic. a little difficult but makes it more fun. I loved it.
1481251880|5.0|I just want to thank Colleen for writing books that I not only enjoy but that invoke myriad emotions from me, I laugh, I cry,etc.  I can relate to the realness of her characters. She is butterflying Amazing!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this game.  I haven't seen my kindle in a week.  It has almost exactly what she was looking for in a horse game.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The movie provided an excellent end to the Batman saga.  We'll watch them all in a row now to the final ending.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Have to admit it's a workout with gusto and not for the fainthearted.  The 3 levels make it doable.  A good workout for those of us you like to exercise at home.  Worth the money.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|We enjoyed this movie.  It took some time to adjust to not having Matt Damon in the lead.  But it was well done and answered some of the unaswered questions from the previous Bourne books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addi&ccedil;tive and fun! I couldn't stop playing it after my friend showed me it! Laggy sometimes but otherwise good quality and keeps me at it!
B003L0HZ5O|5.0|Black Keys are awesome and they rock it through out this album. Love to buy albums that you can listen to from beginning to end.
1400069289|5.0|This by far the best book I have ever read when it comes to personal responsibility. I think every human has habits that it does not enjoy and this book helped understand them and break them. It also helps you understand why society acts the way it does sometimes. I would highly recommend this to anyone I know.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This book is a page turner and a great option if you are on a long trip. It really helped time fly by.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but was disappointed in the ending. It had to end at some point I guess.  After watching the documentary aired on PBS that this novel was based on, I was just hungry for more of the story.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I just started playing this game but it seems fun so far. The objects aren't too difficult to locate and the music is eerie.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Better than Temple Run. Non stop fun. Challenging and exciting... Very awesome... would recommend to all my friends. One of the best free games we have ever played.
B00136S0NE|5.0|The partner ship of Hanserd and Irglova led to this wonderful soundtrack that is unmatched. Quiet, pensive, reserved and pained at times, these songs in their simplistic arrangements will capture your heart. Truly music for the emotions.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|No Oscar winner, but quirky and a usual Tim Burton &#34;kid&#34; movie for adults ... and older kids.  Serves up memorably weird animated characters/animals - and good triumphs in the end.

B009EEHVA0|5.0|An quiet guy my age saves his modern-day daughter whose illusions about a shopping-mall, birthday-horse world are crushed by reality.  Good acting, good movie pace, and great action.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Although the theme is somewhat reminiscent of The Manchurian Candidate (one of my all time favorites...from the 60's in Black & White) it is without a doubt a real gem. Well written and acted, it holds you chapter after chapter.<br /><br />I believe that it ranks just behind 24, which moves a long a bit more quicker as my favorite series in this genre. The back story slowly unfolds ans the action progresses. This tactic make you want to learn more each episode.<br /><br />Damian Lewis who starred in Band of Brothers gives a landmark performance as  Nicholas Brody a Marine that has been captured by the Al Quaida types in Iraq or Afghanistan and turned into a possible sleeper agent for the terrorists. After being freed by a spec-op team he is returned to the US and after a debrief,  Claire Danes plays Carrie Mathison, a CIA officer who<br />suspects that Brody is not quite right.<br /><br />Brody returns to a wife who thinking he is dead after eight years is having an affair with his Marine Corps buddy.. Morena Baccarin who played the lizard lady in V plays Brody's wife. She is terrific in the part and a real knockout.<br /><br />Watch the first episode and you will become hooked as I did.

1405910259|5.0|These books are AMAZING. So good and if you think they stumble too close to 50 shades this book is where they separate. The first one does mirror 50 shades but the second part two is where the stories break. Great books!
0446554995|5.0|Excellent reading although Prendgast was a little different this time...more physical  than cerebral I thought...Thoroughly enjoyed it,  Hope the next one is here quickly.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|A great expedition into the unknown and magical world of Wonderland. Reflects a little of life`s mysteries since when we grow up it becomes a little like  Alice`s journey.
0765325950|3.0|Overall, I feel this novel succeeded as a riveting book, but ultimately fell short of great as an adequate capstone to the Wheel of Time series. On the positive side, the battle sequences were fast-paced and thrilling, and Mat and Perrin, my two favourite characters, featured strongly. Perrin especially benefited from growth in his capabilities as a character, becoming significantly more powerful by the end of the novel than at the beginning. Moreover, the triumphs, failures and deaths of various characters with whom I have spent the better part of two decades were very emotional.<br /><br />However, on the negative side, and most importantly, the ending of A Memory of Light, the Epilogue, suffered from a serious deficit of emotion. The Epilogue was apparently largely written by Robert Jordan himself, and therefore responsibility for this must be shared by him and Brandon Sanderson. Regardless, what should have been the emotional high-point of the entire series, following humankind's triumph in the Last Battle due to the courage and sacrifice of millions, led by their champion the Dragon Reborn, was instead flat and emotionless.<br /><br />** SEE COMMENTS FOR SPOILER-HEAVY ANALYSIS OF THE ENDING **<br /><br />I've heard people described how difficult it is to write a satisfying conclusion to fantasy series. For an example of how it can be done, brilliantly, I refer you to the end the The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. The scenes at the field in Ithilien, when Frodo and Sam were celebrated by the gathered armies of Middle Earth, including the telling of the Tale of Frodo Nine-Fingers and The Ring of Doom, as Sam had dreamed of, amid many cries of \\"praise them with great praise!!\\", was the joyful end that saga deserved. What a pity WoT couldn't finish  on a similarly emotional and uplifting note.<br /><br />Therefore, unfortunately, I have to grade this as one of the weaker books in the series. Three stars from me.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Wonderful futuristic story of a robot that can feel. Love is a magical  and unexpected experience even in the futur.
B003SI3URQ|4.0|A slow start that didn't keep children's attention but about 15 min in the action started. That's when the kids were hooked. Music has a gospel theme, but no catchy tunes.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|So alike the books. I so look forward to the complete second season to continue following the game of power for the  right to yield all the power in the seven kingdoms and beyond.
B008476HBM|5.0|Pride and Prejudice, I can now say, is a classic for a reason. Though hard to understand at times for the old style of writing, it is a very entertaining story that I believe is worth the effort. (I must admit that I was able to follow along better because I have seen the movie, which can act as a guide.)
B0084IHVC0|5.0|This was my daughter`s musical inspiration as a child. She now plays in a jazz band . Goes to show how movies provide lifelong inspiration if touch one`s heart.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A wonderful  story , that gives one hope , that growing older , does not deminish ones worth, nor end ones usefulness.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|There are some sad parts so if you have young children be aware you will likely have to answer some questions about pet death.  I enjoyed the language in this movie the most as a parent. A lot of kids films use words I find inappropriate but this one did not.  I'd buy this if it were on sale I think.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I had just finished watching The Godfather movies and really wanted to read the book.  As expected, this book surpasses the movie because so much more is explained and connected.
B005USZML4|5.0|I'd read part of this in the large print edition but this was just as facinating as he other  books.
B009CGRUW4|5.0|If you don't know....you better ask somebody!!!!  A true classic movie.  A must see for all movie collectors.  The true start of Vin Diesel.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|I'm still trying to get my files and these programs to sync.  I had a little problem with compatibility, but I'm working on it.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|Worst of the Batman series of movies....could not even sit through it! If spending money on a movie rental, I need something to hold my attention.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it. I dont have to be on my lap top or take my lap top to my PINTEREST...Get this now
0385344333|1.0|Those initials don't stand for Pick Up instead it means this book stinks.  I was never so disappointed in a Reacher book.  It just made no sense at all and made me feel like he (Child) was struggling with writers block through the whole thing.  Save your money and hope his next one is better.!!!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|not to thrilled of it at all. not sure why but if i were you i would give it a try
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This is a lovely story of struggle and pain and growth...not necessarily for the main character but for all those around him. I love Auggie and his family. I think this was written with a great deal of realism and a true insight into how people, especially children, can be. It is a story of courage, but it is also a story of love.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because there were some minor bumps with the writing; I felt a couple of the supporting characters' stories were left unresolved and the major outward transition for the main character was a little rushed, or, if not rushed, not adequately illustrated. However, these were minor bumps and I would have given it 4.5 stars if I was able. As far as I'm concerned, the story will always trump the mechanics of writing and Auggie's story is the story of how it's never too late for all of us to becomre the people we were meant to be.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|do not get this my grand daughter didnt like it. you would think after so many negative statements about a game it would go away.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|I loved this movie. Brilliant performances (Meryl, Amy, Phillip) and an amazing story line. I was so not expecting this type of movie, but I loved it.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Form what I have played it it is cute. But honestly havent played it alot. Im not 100% if Im going to keep it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This one was very very funny and so delightful for the whole family to enjoy with a huge bowl of popcorn on a wintery evening. We will enjoy this one as well for many years to come.
B008DM4OTA|1.0|I think it is to hard for little kids. My grand kids told me this and I laughed looked at game and tried it..I couldnt do so of it.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This one is a great, super funny movie to see with the whole family. We have the others and it fits the storyline to a tee. We will enjoy this one for many years to come.
B000001ESP|5.0|Bought this for my 7-year old grandson. He's an amazing drummer and Rush is his favorite band. He asked for this CD for his birthday.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good read keep me intrigued enjoyed it till the last chapter. I would highly recommend especially if you have enjoyed other Nicholas sparks books
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This book starts new stories that go nowhere.<br />No mention of Tyrion, Catlyn Stark, Jon Snow.<br />It drags on long winded. I am very dissapointed.<br />I just discovered this author through the success of the Game of Thrones HBO TV series.<br />I decided to buy all the books to see what I may have missed out on. Book 1 and 2 follows the HBO show  mostly word for word. Book 3 was exciting. I loved the twists and devastating turns that book 3 took. Made me stay up late a few nights to read what would happen next.<br />Book 4 is all over the place does not continue plots and story lines. Introduces new characters that seem to have no purpose.<br />The Imp, Catlyn and Snow are nowhere to be found. Cersie's rantings are predictable.<br />I think this was a filler book possibly to make more money knowing he had a following and why would you NOT buy the next in a very exciting series.<br />I hope book 5 proves to be as exciting as the first 3 books. I'm hooked and will read it although I'm not sure if Martin can redeem his story line.<br />I read that Book 3 HBO series will broken up into 2 seasons 3 & 4.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A fun and quirky story.  An unpredictable read is always a nice surprise.  A nice story for fans of anything Gaelic.
0525952926|5.0|I have read every Follett book. Although I really didn't want to spend $20 to read this on Kindle (ridiculous!), and some of the negative reviews ALMOST made me wait until the price dropped, I am very happy that I followed through with the purchase. Like most of his other books, I couldn't put this down. It had been a while since I read Fall of Giants, and I was afraid that I would have a hard time picking up on the characters and their offspring, but Follett masterfully wove the characters back in rather seamlessly, refreshing my memory.<br /><br />There are some implausible and serendipitous moments in the book, but can't that be said about all of his books? And can't the same be said about books by other historical fiction writers, like Michener and Jennings. Hard to tell these kinds of stories without an abundance of coincidences. I can't understand why Follett lovers would not like this book. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that some of the experiences being told are painful to read. Perhaps it is more palatable in Pillars of the the Earth because of the centuries that have passed. We like to think of ourselves as more civilized now. I don't know. I'm just speculating. But I loved it AND I learned so much about history that I thought I had already known! Can't wait until the third part of the trilogy comes out!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The authors knowledge of history is prodigious, story line was exciting, but much too much verbage regarding the history of the times.
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Keep Niki Heat going. This could easily turn into a J.D. Robb, death series, that just keeps on going, continuing to build on the main characters.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|I choose the rating because it's a great kids movie, there was nothing i disliked about it. I would recommand it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book loved were she gas taken the story can't wait to start the next book. You will enjoy this book
0345803507|5.0|This book is amazing. I love the trilogy, I want the author to keep writing more. I recommand it I hope the author comes out with a 4 and 5 book. There's nothing I disliked.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome! I love my horse! It actually makes me feel like I'm taking care of a real horse!
B00003CXSM|5.0|Great movie, I love Jennifer Lopez I think she is a great actress. There was nothing I disliked, I would recoomand it to everyone.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Its purely amazing the introduction, the plot it was perfect. So were the characters and the monsters. Putting Greek and Romans was awesome and lots of action.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is such an nice old movie. I loved it, everyone should watch this. It's great for people who are into old classic movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an amazing ending to an amazing series. So detailed and vibrant. I never wanted to put it down
B002ZG9968|5.0|Such a funny movie. Everyone should watch, you won't be disappointed. I reccomand it to everyone love Jennifer Lopez. Disliked nothing.
B007URVZJ6|1.0|it was the best book i ever read in my life and i learned a lot of things from it
0345803493|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down, it is amazing. The author should come out with more books. It's an attention grabber.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is one of the rare games where you can enjoy it at all ages and never get cheated out on your money. It is free and you can actually enjoy it without paying full price. I recommend this for all horse lovers, wether you are social or not, as there is an option of friending others who play it too.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was fun and entertaining. The puzzles we're a little repetative but the storyline was consistant and cohesive. The hidden object games could have been made to bea little more complex. But overall it was fun.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's pretty funny  and kind of weird  and I weekly like the beginning me and my friends love diary of a wimpy kid
0765325950|5.0|I pre-ordered this item and received about half off the cover price.  I gave this as a late Christmas gift ( I was aware of when it would be released and knew it would not be available until after Christmas.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow! Very by good. I liked the point of views in the story. Also, it makes u think about things & learn not to take so much for granted because u never know when u could lose it.
0393343405|3.0|Through the first 1/2 to 3/4 of the book, I kept waiting for what was in the poem and how it brought about such radical change. The story of Poggio's discoveries was interesting, but I wanted to get to the meat of the book.
B004SIP6QI|5.0|I love the service because I can go back to my favorite movies and you have what I love.  The stores in our area have a terrible selection, and I was really discouraged when I couldn't find what I wanted.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Don't know why I waited so long before watching this series.  Having two uncles involved in some of the battles shown brought tears and a greater appreciation for their sacrifice.
B008K7RGA2|4.0|Let me start by saying I am not a huge Gheorghiu fan so I bought this DVD with certain reservation. I can honestly say that  it was not as bad as I thought it would be, but I did not find it as incredible as some reviews have made it out to be.  Kaufman was incredible one of the best Cavaradossis I have seen, even though his voice is not as lyrical as Corelli's or Pavarotti's (as another reviewer mentioned).  Angela, well she is Angela, and as she so aptly said in the interview in the bonus feature - she was playing herself!!. Apparently she does not have a wide range of mannerisms and/or facial expressions as often times she reminded me of her Violetta from another DVD I also own. For my taste (and in my humble opinion) in the 2nd Act she reminded me too much of the Callas Covent Garden video that's available, but I guess that is how she teaches herself these roles!!.  Without a doubt Terfel, was the scariest of the lot. Probably because of the similar hair style and the facial expressions  I felt like I was watching  Wotan channeling Scarpia !!  Although this approach  worked at times, most often I felt he came across as  too \\"lecherous\\" for my taste and not as refined as I always picture Scarpia to be.  And no, I did not need to see all his facial expressions up close (I would hate to watch him and Bartoli in a video performance) - but that is the fault of the videos. What doesnt look so bad as seen from from the audience, does not necessarily look good on the screen.<br /><br />Only two things that really bothered me though. First has to do with this performance. Whoever staged this, obviously has no sense of \\"reality\\".  How in the world  can Tosca stab Scarpia (several times),  have him fall COMPLETELY on top of her (felt sorry for Angela), and not only was the knife sparkling clean - BUT he had a HUGE blood stain in front of his shirt and Angela's immaculately white dress did not have ONE single drop of red on it !!!<br /><br />Second thing and this is just awish of mine I guess regarding the performances of Tosca I have seen.  For once,  I would love to see a Tosca that does not stop and think twice (to see where she is going to land i guess) before she jumps!!  It sooo breaks the mood for me!!!  LOL  Don't tell me that somebody can not rig this up somehow that she can just let herself go backwards to land safely on top of something to break her fall!!!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first of Lee Child's Reacher novels so I am assuming that his style and development of the character will improve with time.  That is not to say that this is not an entertaining read but the plot and characters come off as not quite genuine enough.  In my opinion this is worth the price of admission for being entertaining and informative.  I hope the next Reacher novels I read improve in the areas I mentioned.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I played it on a different tablet and it was awesome me and my brother started it and immediately got obsessed so long story short BOOYA!
B00136JR2M|5.0|Must have album for any hip hop fan. Greatest Wu Tang Album and RIP Ol Dirty Bastard. GO Buy it~
B00APUQRPC|2.0|I love baseball and I some wonderful movies (Bull Durham, The Natural, A Game of Their Own, etc.) have been made using baseball as a metaphor for life.  This is not one of them.  Every scene portrays a cliche.  You know them and you don't need to see this movie to confirm that fact.
B009FZFONO|5.0|When I first heard about The Walking Dead I thought, &#34;Oh cool, another zombie show&#34; and figured I'd give it a shot...I haven't stopped watching it since. This is not just about the cover your eyes, edge of your seat fright factor of zombies eating brains and spreading the infection. This is a look into the psyche of each individual character....what the end of the world pushes them to do, and how they deal with it in their different ways. The characters are rich and colorful, yet the show is not afraid to remove the key players frequently. The great thing is that unlike many other shows, the removal of known characters doesn't hinder the story. Rather, the addition of new characters that are just as interesting, if not more so, makes the show even more enjoyable. My boyfriend and I are completely hooked, and eagerly awaiting the return of Season 3. C'mon February!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I felt such sympathy for Jamie and life he endured as a young boy.  The rural Irish farmland of his adult life and it's residents are so aptly portrayed and one could hear the Irish brougue in the sweetly crafted dialog.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I purchased this CD for my daughter for Christmas. I guess I made the right choice, she likes it a lot. I'm not into this kind of music, I love country, but some of the songs aren't bad.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I love Family Guy and I was hoping this would make me laugh out loud the same way. It has a couple funny parts but overall it's just boring and dumb.  Boo.  Disappointed.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|I don't mind strong female characters but I don't need the fact that they are strong female characters to be constantly shoved in my face because I'm intelligent enough to figure that out for myself!  This movie constantly shoved them in my face so much so that I ended up hating the strong female characters and I only finished watching the movie because I paid for it; I don't remember anything else about the movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was alright. Nothing special but I think I set my expectations too high because the people that recommended it to me over sold it.
B0055OK2T0|1.0|The scifi idea was a good one but this is basically a stupid love story at its core.  The scifi wrapping was just a disguise to trick geeks into watching it!  It is so hard to find good scifi anymore...sigh.

B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Most live action movies that are based on video games suck!  This movie was one of the few exceptions and my money was well spent; I hope the sequel will feature more intense battle scenes
0451232852|5.0|This is  a five star book excellently written, about events before, during and until the end of WW1.Great charters of all the countries involved in the war just a all roung great read
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|It's the same as Arnold's version but with a slight twist and better special effects.  I wouldn't mind watching it again but I wouldn't pay to see it a second time.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|This book has the ability to make you want to keep reading even when you are too tired to go on. Therefore to me it deserves a four star rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is an easy read and had my interest from the first page. I couldn't wait to start the next book!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|5 stars for but I've only gotten seven pages so I wonder if there is a 8th page. So yea...
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Last November I heard \\"It's time\\" on the radio for the first time and after listening to that unforgettable mandolin hook I knew I had to explore the album.  I wasn't disappointed.  Even though every song seems to be connected, they all sound fresh and vibrant. The sound of some of the songs is so inspiring that last December there was a period where listening to the album was the very first thing I did after waking up. The production of every track is flawless and there is a message of living and enjoying life that makes you look at some things in a different way.  At $8 you definetely get your money's worth. \\"Night Visions\\" is a standout among the albums released last year.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have a confession - I am not a fan of anything teen especially the books so when I started reading this and realized it was based on a 17 year old, I was already put off but I paid for the book so - I vowed to at-least read half way before I gave up. I am so glad I did.<br /><br />It is a story about a girls life - the life she thought she had, the person she thought she was and watching the plot unfold was captivating to say the least. I love that there is nothing 'explicit'(or no unrealistic - nonsense details about ***) in the book.<br /><br />It's a precious story. I laughed out loud, I was teary, sad, angry, hopeful, hopeless, understanding in some cases and totally 'in the moment' with the characters. There weren't many unnecessary descriptions about the trees blowing in a northerly direction and the smell of the air - aka: unnecessary details, I read every line which is not normal for me.<br /><br />I read 48 books last year alone (only counting those on my kindle) and of those, there were only 4 that really stood out for me & made it to my great reads section. This book will definitely be the first 2013 addition to my \\"Great reads\\" section.<br /><br />Well written, well thought out.<br />Good Job Colleen Hoover I will definitely be reading more books by this author.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Awesome book! I can't wait to watch the movie! The story was so well told that I literally could not put the book down!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is well worth watching.  It's great fun and shows some impressive musical and comedic talent from so many of the cast, not just the principles.  Buy this, then buy the soundtrack and sing along like your life depends on it.  Why are you still reading when you should be at the checkout screen?!...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Enjoy the app great graphics  Would recommend to others as it was recommended to me. Find myself constantly trying to beat my time.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|A game that encourages children to surf the subway is ignorant and dangerous. There is nothing cute about seeing the body of a child/teenager torn to shreds because they attempted to surf the subway cars. Bad idea for a game &amp; irresponsible.
B000GOZ0ZK|4.0|This is a great movie I love it ,the story line gives you something serious to think about. don't tamper with things that you shouldn't scientists are always pushing the envelope thankfully this is only fictional who would want something like a shark to be able to think !
0425263916|5.0|Enjoyed this book alot.<br />Similar to 50 shades but not as dominant and summissive as that.<br />Would recommend anyone to read this book series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is very realistic. Shines a light on domestic abuse and courage. End of this book was amazing. Highly recommended.
0425263908|5.0|Excellent series<br />Enjoyed alot/similar to 50 shades but not as indepth in the sexual scenes as 50 shades.  Great story lines.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun and free game I can play and just relax while I do it. I recommend this game.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Great movie with fun characters that my family and I have enjoyed many times and I am sure will enjoy many more times too.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very  entertaining reading.  The author is a master of weaving a fictional story into a factual place in time.  The reader feels
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Nobody watches this kind of movie for the acting or the dialogue. That said, this is a high adrenaline rush. Great CGI cityscapes and technosets make for a visual spectacle. And so do Farrell and Beckinsdale. She's really becoming quite the action star gymnast. More power to her.  And Farrell is well cast as the unwitting hero, he doesn't overdo it. Though the script calls for a few too many three-story falls where he just gets up, dusts off, and keeps running and rain-of-bullets-but -none-ever-hit-good-guys scenes it's still engaging and suspenseful. But if we're going to start taking stars off for plausibility, what movie would stand a chance.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have read all of here series of books and love them all. She is an amazing writer. can't wait until the next one
B00B19DMUE|2.0|The movie was fine but the streaming was lousy.  Kept having to back out and restart the movie.  Suggest renting rather than streaming.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The best book I've ever read<br />I think they should make 10000<br />more books this is the best book I've ever read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun game!!! it is very realistic!!! graphics are great. this game is very entertaining. I recommend this game for horse lover's.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|If I had to describe this game in 1 word !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good game  fun and very accused  great perfect grey game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|With an ending like that, I must read the last book. I must say I was quite flustered with the first, but very happy with what was revealed in this one. I find hope for an excellent ending to the trilogy.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|An Interesting documentary,quite a timely topic in light  of the Manti T'eo situation.  Worth taking a look at this documentary.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I felt like I could connect to this book. Never seeing the movie before this makes me want to see it. Charlie is such a realistic character going through real things, it made me love the book even more. I recommend it, it's a great read.
B0031RAOVY|1.0|This is one of those movies so incredibly bad that whenever my wife talks about watching a movie the kids remind her she picked out this one and she should not be allowed to choose any more movies. The kids don't yet get the nuances of bad acting but they certainly recognize a horrible movie when they see one. I don't know what people are thinking who rate this more than one star. Maybe they feel bad for the people who made this and think they deserve our pity. I pity the people who wasted their time watching this. Don't be one of them.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Thousand Splendid Suns -  Excellent story & well written, couldn't put the book down until it was finished.  Well worth reading
B009NPKTN6|1.0|One  of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.  Just awful.  No idea how this survived on Broadway
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was FANTASTIC. It kept me guessing through the whole book. I loved the romance that bloomed and the love that developed. I just Loved this book
B0086700CM|1.0|It's a bad game and it lags a whole whole lot there at a lot better running games out there like my favorite the Bear Gryyls survival run that there is and I mean is a great running game.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I needed a calendar to keep track of my busy life and to help me reach my 2013 goal to be more organized.  At first the Jorte Calendar seemed to be a dream come true in caldendar apps!  I added several upcoming events up until April 2013, then went back to add birthdays to my calendar.  I've tried at least 20 times to add birthdays the same way that I added all the other events and it will not work.  It either changes the date to December 31st or does not create them at all.  I am going to have to delete the app and install it again,  and give it another try.  I will start with birthdays this time so I do not waste as much time as I did the first time.  If it will not let me create birthdays on this calendar at that point, then I will delete it permanently.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|All the other games are good but this one no it's bad I don't like it I don't know what you will think about this one but it is hard and not as fun as the other ones.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|I watch this show together with my 12-year-old daughter. We love it.  The storylines are pretty whimsical, granted- you need to be able to stretch your imagination.  Don't expect realism here.  But the idea is original, the characters are well developed (you will genuinely care for the good ones and love to hate the bad ones!), and the plot is compelling enough to keep you at the edge of your seat wanting to know what will happen next.<br />The best thing about this show for me is that finally, someone has made an entertaining family series that is only rated PG.  There is no profanity, overly gruesome violence, and there are no sexual situations.  It's a great show for adults and children alike.  I watch this show WITH my child, not FOR her, if you know what I mean... I'm very happy to have found a show that I am can actually share interest in with my child!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Really enjoyed this Mitch Rapp novel.  A little different than others, but really good.  Keep writing and hopefully people will understand that sometimes there is only one way to deal with certain situations....
B009E3EY38|5.0|I love the music, quality, price, selections, but most of all, I love Led Zeppelin.  I would definitely buy more Led Zeppelin.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great game. It's a lot of fun and really gets you thinking. Always trying to be better and faster. Too fun.
B007M45PMU|4.0|It gets better with each listen. A little slow as a collection, but definitely a welcome new sound on the scene. My favorite number is &#34;Submarine.&#34; I know &#34;Ho Hey&#34; gets a lot of downloads but it's the deeper tracks that make this piece shine.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I have a 3 yr. old cousin who wanted to play on my kindle fire. I scrolled through my apps for a good app for people her age to play. I was happy when I saw I hadn't deleted it yet. I let her play it. Whenever she healed an animal,  she would say all better! She loved healing the patients. I reccommend.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|My husband and I have this movie on DVD but he really had been wanting to get it on Blu-Ray.  Much better!!  He loves this movie and I find myself watching it with him every time he puts it on.  Very exciting and action packed!
B00077F948|5.0|This item was arrived at time. Very quickly. I enjoy this music all time. I amvery happy with this music.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|He's Robocop with a bad frown! I like Karl Urban but I don't know which was worse, this or Pathfinder.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game, very addicting!  Reminds me of days at the fair.  I would recommend to all my friends.  It's free so give it a try!
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I LOVE THIS WHOLE CD! WHEN WORKING OUT AT THE GYM HAS GREAT rhythem to get through the times I think I just can't finish ..but I do...with a little help from my friend Phil;)!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love love LOVE this game. It is so fun and addictive. I also like the fact that it doesn't require every second of your day to be successful. Plus the graphics are AMAZING!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game! Is really fun I play it every day!<br />I have no bad sides about this . Game I love it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such an endearing story of the early 1900's in England.  The story grows on you as you watch each episode and Maggie Smith has always been a favorite actress of mine.  She plays an excellant part as the matriarch of the Crowley family. Each episodes intertwines with a new story and I can't wait to watch the next episode to reveal many secrets that the family has as well as the stories of their servants..
B005DC68NI|5.0|I bought a \\"How to publish your e-book\\" from the stand at a major book retailer, and find David's book to be much better.  Simple to understand, simple to use.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the math breakdown on how much an author makes from traditional publishing vs. eBooks.  Eye-opening.
B00AWTTUHI|1.0|Watchmen type rehash with reagan replacing nixon, batman has a little girl as robin instead of the rent boy he had in the past.  Still good anmation great vocie acting and good stroyline beside the fact that joker is evil just because he gay?
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|S ad reading but i apppreciate the insight into the depravity of a man.I a m happy the young lady is in recovery and i hope parents  read this book. The depravity can happen any where and at any time
0345803493|5.0|My sister loved them. Gave them to her for her birthday and she didn't do anything else but read them.
B009LRE040|5.0|An excellent movie that down loaded to my Tivo box (HD Series 3) and played great. For those who haven't seen this movie yet be prepared, it's 2 hours 44 minutes long. Wow.
0345803507|5.0|My sister loved them. Gave them to her for her birthday and she didn't do anything else but read them.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|I usually find the Disney princess movies to be ... well... not my style.  This one was thoroughly enjoyable.  Highly recommended.
0345803485|5.0|My sister loved them. Gave them to her for her birthday and she didn't do anything else but read them.
B00979CS50|5.0|Everything you want in a contemporary Neil Young with Crazy Horse Album.  Great songs and long, great jams.  If you want to know what's on Neil's mind, and you don't have the time to read his terrific new book (which I also highly recommend), this album will fill you in on Neil's current concerns and causes.  Keep on rockin'!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game really rocks! I'm 36 years old and I love playing and collecting.<br />I really like the way you can collect and grow you ice comuniy. I love the little families.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|so good music is amazing everytime you listen to it...in the car...home....at school the end!! it was a great album!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|easy reading, good old fashioned values, great book for any age level above 10 yrs. old.<br />I love the old classics....
B00AESN8XY|4.0|I had a lot of fun with this, certainly worth the price. Ultimately you realize there is a simple method of winning every time that ends &#34;replay-ability.&#34;<br /><br />Still, for a couple of busks, this is several hours of fun.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved this show...every episode is a cliff hanger! Each episode keeps you in suspense. I couldn't wait for the next show.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Oh yeah, this is a winner.  Lots of fun and lots of variety of &#34;birds&#34;!.  Just love it!  Makes you think and plan the attack.
0765325950|3.0|The wheel weaves as the wheel wills, but I remain doubtful that the last installment of the Wheel of Time is what the wheel would will. WoT is arguably one of the most notable fantasy epics to date. It is sad that it is now over, and sadder that the ending did not do justice to the series. Don't take me wrong, perhaps I had too high expectations for this book because in The Gathering Storm and to a lesser extent in Towers of Midnight, Brandon Sanderson invigorated the series, moved things forward (while occasionally in a bit too straightforward manner, yet true to a genuine Wheel of Time style of focusing also in the less important plot lines), brought back the excitement that the series had early on (books 1-6 or so). And now this.<br /><br />Without going into details, some of the main characters are untrue to their personalities (Sanderson really never had a good grasp of Mat, e.g.). They just would not behave as they do in AMoL. Also, the book renders A LOT of Wheel of Time pointless. Jordan, and Sanderson himself, used some thousands of pages in foreshadowing: important events, details, characters (even major ones), ... you name it, yet scarcely any of that had anything to do with the conclusion. It is not sufficient grounds to say that they just paid attention to detail. It is not that, it is underestimating the value of the readers' time. And I would be surprised if very many agree with the anticlimatic conclusion.<br /><br />Sanderson was given a very difficult task. He managed exceptionally well in The Gathering Storm, so well that I went on to read his other books as well. TGS is one of the best in the whole series. In Towers of Midnight he started to hurry (all the while concentrating on secondary issues as well, though), but the story was still coherent and fairly believable. But here, I think he started to wear down. He was in a hurry, both to finish this book, and to get back to working on his own material. I don't know which way it has been, has therebeen too much outside direction (from team Jordan) into this installment or too little. Whatever the reason, I cannot recommend WoT to anyone as it stands. I used to, to everyone. WoT has already broken some conventional rules of the trade; would it be impossible to get a remake, or a director's cut or something that would make this series whole? For this book only, three stars. For the impact on the whole series, one star.
B007U8U1V8|3.0|Some good tunes. I do love the southern jazzy style and bombastic percussions. Though some of the songs sound a bit experimental and end up feeling a little disjointed. I can't find the common thread that unifies and connects to make a more complete story.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I read a couple of them last year in random order so I decided to start from the beginning! I love the ending! This series is very suspenseful! Can wait to start on the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app love horses ull love this for sure its great and interactive for all ages<br />Only wish the horses looked more different not just the same base model in different colors
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|Not Bad at all for a part 2. It was entertainment, I liked it, I don't remember which cover I have
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show. Can't get enough of it. Could watch it 24/ 7. I think it is just as good as 24.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Not Bad, It did what it was bought for. Entertain me. I will never look at Mr. Lincoln the same again
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Choices can be made as to the kind of music you wish to listen to--classical and oldies are my favorites. Then, after you've made this on initial decision, you can choose a station from anywhere in the world.  I like to listen to classical from Australia or Atlanta. Talk time is limited which I also like.
B001AT4Y84|4.0|This movie is WOE!! Meaning very gooooooood!! I thnk ppl should rent or buy this because its worth every dime
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Recommended for the typical guy that likes action.<br />Liked: the graphics of shooting scenes<br />Dislike: The storyline was left wanting.
B001AP11L6|5.0|Excellent rock and roll.  In the cold cold night Meg's vocals are reminiscent of Peggy Lee's Fever.  Brave guitar sound.  Loud and provocative.  I recommend.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Reading the book was fun, although I consider it to be somehow predictable.<br />Still I recommend it, you'll have fun reading it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Icky thump is a rock and roll anthem.  This is a great CD very creative with Rag and Bone and Conquest and the Scottish folk song about St. Andrew.  I recommend.
B004J64QR4|5.0|I've been watching clips of this on YT. This is well worth the download price.<br />It's what I expected and more.<br />I had been holding off on this and the 10th anniversary. I was waiting to get a new mac. I hate my pc. Was actually surprised to see that I just view it from amazon. It will always be there for me.<br />Now I just hope I can download it when I do get my new mac. Not need internet to listen to it, view it. Not worried about that right now.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Bought this for my son's birthday... you can't go wrong with<br />anything Mr. Cohen does! Great album, as usual.  Thanks...
