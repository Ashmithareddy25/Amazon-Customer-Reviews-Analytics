B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book!! Drew 's POV had me literally laughing out loud!! Normally I don't really like one person POV books, but this author definitely nailed it. Cannot wait to read more from her! AMAZING!!
B00125WAWS|5.0|With Denzel Washington as the main actor in a movie, how can it be bad? He puts in another great performance and I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in a quality movie with a great storyline. The supporting cast did a fantastic job as well.
B0041VB8BO|5.0|Fun.'s first album is upbeat and beautiful and I listen to it over and over again. It is one of the best albums as a whole that I have heard in a while.
B00CDCIQX6|1.0|I would like yo buy the DVD instead of having it on mt computer.  Please make the swich as soon as possible.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love this app so much. It took me a minute to really get how it worked but once I got I really enjoyed myself. Its just mile it would be on your computer and for me its way faster too. I regimens this for everyone. Whenever I need to look something up nonlinear I find myself going straight to my kindle fire. :$
1881273873|4.0|Good insite into how to understand what others need to feel loved.  Not everyone understands love in the same way.  Not just for couples but family and friends.  Good information in building relationships
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I started playing this and found it hard to put down each time. Once you get going you want to beat the previous score so you are hooked. Great time killer!

B004ZGI2KK|5.0|I love the fact that they could take a story that was read to me as a child and create such and amazing movie.<br /><br />Great Job
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|There really is no other word to describe this album. Her voice has a deep and airy quality that sounds soulful and honest and tragic all at the same time. Her lyrics are honest and real and make you really think while you listen. And if you don't feel like it, the music is stunning on its own.<br />The singer's voice and the truthful quality of the lyrics are very similar to Florence and the Machine with a little mixture of Portishead.<br />I feel like I discovered a hidden gem with this band. I highly recommend to those who love strong female voices/lyrics, and indie mixed with a little of rock and soul.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I found this movie to be amazing and out of the world.<br /><br />I love it, I most tell the turth.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! It had me angry, laughing, and even the occasional tear. It's a book that once you pick up you can't put it down! I can't wait to read \\"Catching Fire\\" This is amazayn!!!! :)
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is the best game ever.  I have not stiled playing for 2 weeks. if you don't get this game your missing out.but I wish you could pick a card out of the persons deck if you beat then.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an emotion twisting book. It has very happy parts and very sad parts. This is it great book for adults and children.  R. J. Palacio is a great author . (All of his books are good )
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love jurassic park.. but my game has shut down and will not load.. please fix My park!! thank you. I really miss playing
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is fun - I get to play music I wouldnt have considered before having this.  and it whiles away some time.  However if you are a pianist then you might find this below your grading.  I can-not play piano with both hands this allows you the option of playing either left hand or right - if you can play both together I havent found that option however I doubt it - cos the screen is too small (yh I'm using a kindle fire to procrastinate on).  which brings me to the biggest negative for me with this virtual gadget - the keys are two small so I often hit two keys when I am playing the more fiddly bits of music.  You get about 15 or so default pieces of music ranging from well known 'hits' from handel, chopin, beethoven to the birthday song and even the wedding march lol.  All in all good fun for little kids getting to know the piano and big kids like me wasting time :-)
B00003CXBK|5.0|Another charming, fantastical, compelling and incredibly unique story from Studio Ghibli that I very much enjoyed. The score was exceptional.
B00COHIFQS|4.0|The story, special effects and acting are to be expected from any del Toro film. Until about twenty minutes from the ending...it just gets a little too corny for me.<br />Otherwise fantastically creepy!
B005OZE9SA|1.0|i bought it about six month ago when i was  in bussines trip, then  i opened it about 2 days ago  , and it doesnt work when i plug in my laptop it doent work it has no usb light and i tried 4 computers but id doesnt work too i tried everything but its seems that it is broken ,  give money back or send another
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius, you never seem to disappoint. Another great album. Can't wait to hear it live at the concert. \\"True believers\\" rocks!
B006H5120E|5.0|Short and sweet: this is the best film ever made! The 3D-Version is pretty awesome and the bonus-material is very good.
B009NY43NY|3.0|for the last book in the series, it was a serious letdown.  it really didn't close any storylines and i was disappointed.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show depicts what viking life was probably like 1000 years ago. The story line and folklore are interesting as well.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Decent end to the series.  Probably what you expected.  Dragged on a bit, but otherwise on par with the other books.
B005RUUUAI|3.0|I should not have ordered season 2 (after watching season 1) but I did thinking it might get better.  Mind you, I think Breaking Bad and Homeland are the most phenomenal around series so maybe I am spoiled with outstanding scripts and acting.  WD is basically a &#34;made for TV&#34; saga.  Just like all the major network shows you can predict what happens next- be it zombies, dinosaurs, aliens, or whatever is plaguing earth, the script, characters, and &#34;drama&#34; are basically the same.  I should have known when, in season 1, the main character happens to find his wife and child alive and well in the 1st clutch of survivors- despite the fact that billions of people have become zombies (what are the odds?).
B00340LM8C|5.0|Don't miss this classic Alfred Hitchcock movie!<br />The inimitable Cary Grant and Gorgeous Grace Kelly<br />make this a must-watch film for all movie fans.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I wonder why the US agricultural policy is so skewed to Food Inc and not in support of healthful eating and a diverse agricultural system? This documentary will really open your eyes and raise big questions that each of us should demand answers for.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I want more<br />can't wait for season 4 to be on dvd<br />can't get it on PBS in North Dakota so will have to wait<br />till season 4 is available on dvd<br />watch the previous dvd's often<br />love the cast and the story line
B0050DIWFC|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST LEGAL THRILLERS I HAVE EVER READ.  IT IS an intricately woven tapestry of the conflicts of not only being accused but of the legal perspectives of prosecution. It is more than worth the cost and time...It leaves a lingering question of beyond a reasonable doubt.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|unless your a little kid don't waste your time on this one<br />too simple and not challenging enough<br />would  not recommend for adults
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|Why not charge the $.99 cents and then open it up to paying cust.... I will not give you one cent if you are not going to give me nothing in return....
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Sanderson has done a great job of maintaining the feel of this series and continuing to develop the myriad characters all the way to the books conclusion. It can be very difficult to continue someone else's work and do it justice, but I believe Sanderson has done Mr. Jordan proud. That being said, the ending took a path I hadn't expected without it really being a twist. That, I think, takes skill. All too often people seem to think that a book or movie needs a twist at the end to make it good. They don't, but that doesn't mean the author has to do what you expect either. It's hard to explain without giving details, but It flows very naturally without any &#34;shock value&#34;. What I felt instead was a simple &#34;oh, I hadn't thought of that.&#34;<br /><br />Regarding the rest of the book. Sanderson continues to conduct a masterful interweaving of plotlines, that I would think even the original author would find difficult to keep track of. But despite this being Robert Jordan's world, Brandon Sanderson has made it his own.<br /><br />My only real gripe with this book was the introduction of a new faction that hadn't been mentioned in any of the previous 13 books. Sure, there were very slight hints, but I still felt cheated.<br /><br />Pick up the book, you won't be disappointed.
B009NY43NY|3.0|After the last book in the series I wasn't expecting much... sometimes this happens with writers that churn out books in quick succession.  The stories jump the shark or become so boring that it's almost insulting to read them.  It does wrap up some of the loose ends but not all.  It feels like the complexities of some of the characters are totally dropped as they are packed neatly into boxes and shoved into the attic.  Most notably the writing style seems to be more unpolished than I remember, and there are again some nagging inconsistencies with earlier books that even though it's been a few years since I read the first novels I was able to pick up.  At times I wasn't sure if I was reading a Shades of Grey novel, with the fumbling intimacy scenes.  If you've stuck through the series this long I'm sure you'll want to read this just to know how things finish.  But it will leave you disappointed.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|My wife and I are avid readers and have a substantial Kindle library.  We both used the older Kindle tablets that didn't have the back lit screen, so always needed some kind of additional lighting if reading in a dim area or in the evening.  I decided to download this app for my Nexus 7 and am quite pleased with it.  I am able to access the entire library and read in darkened areas without fumbling with some type of additional light source.  It has been great for reading while on airplanes, camping or when I'm some place where lighting isn't adequate to read from my old Kindle tablet.  I also downloaded it on my wife's Ipad as well as the kid's Coby tablet, but have not tried it on the Coby as of yet.  The downside is, the Nexus 7 and Coby have to be in a area where there's WiFi access to download from Amazon or access books in our stored library, whereas, the Kindle tablet has fairly reliable satellite access, similar to a cell phone.  This is not a big problem, as I download several books to the Nexus 7 memory before I go anywhere there may be limited or no WiFi access.
B003G94BZC|4.0|Just as every other Whovian can tell you - when a new Doctor regenerates, you are TOTALLY skeptical and don't really like them right off the bat.  Thus was the feeling when Tennant started to glow, and Matt Smith reappeared as The Doctor.  He was SUCH a departure from David Tennant's version of The Doctor, that it took a while to warm up to him in the beginning.  Tennant's Doctor loved hard, felt deeply, and burned with fire. Additionally, we lose Russel T. Davies as a writer. Russel's writing had SO much heart.  And now we introduce Stephen Moffatt - who has more of a warped sense of style...which as the seasons roll on, becomes undeniably cool and leaves you wanting more.  As for The Doctor - let's just say that Matt's version of The Doctor came on scene bumbling, clumsy, and almost slapstick comical. I immediately hated him..but I stuck with it - and Im so glad I did.<br />SO.....<br />As Matt was allowed to find his version of The Doctor, and we are introduced to the new companions, he literally BECOMES The Doctor.  And a New Doctor is born.<br />The episodes in Season 5 are really good. Im not going to list them all, but you get to meet some really great characters - like Amy, Rory, River Song, Craig (one of my faces) etc...<br />Moffatt manages to find a way to merge the heart of Davies writing filled with heart and Moffatt's own style of twists and turns taking you into the abyss.  Good first start....keep it up!
0553801473|5.0|If you've read the other books you already know this one is going to be sweet.  Probably the best one so far.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Everyone knows when you begin a new job, there is a learning curve...you need time to adjust and find out who you are in the position.  Such was season 5 of Doctor Who - and now introducing - Matt Smith as The Doctor in Season 6!<br />It was this season when I really fell in love with the next Doctor.  Smith found his groove...and Moffatt secured his spot in Doctor Who writing history (Even though he only wrote about 1/2 the episodes)!<br />Awesome season!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is one of the best series I have seen in a long time. It gives a good view of how people were back then
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|There were way too many story lines in this movie - so hard to follow.  When the actors changed to different people during throughout the movie it was more confusing !!
B004S5C91Q|5.0|I found the story told from the child's perspective a little hard to get into. A child's voice can be a little banal. Having said that, this is actually the perfect perspective to tell the story. The more it goes on, the more clever it is, as a choice. It's a GREAT read, I couldn't put it down and the story has stayed with me.
B008Z9L94O|5.0|I had the original triple vinyl set of this album and regretted selling it.  Well this came along and I could tell from the pictures it was worth getting and it didn't disappoint.  One of the best albums of the 90s.  Great packaging and booklets. And of course the songs are awesome from start to finish.  Very consistent album and takes you on a magical journey like all good albums should.
B0080R7O7W|5.0|This was the first song released in 1987, which was included in BAD album some weeks later. In 2012 BAD LP celebrated its 25 years and this single was released, together with other BAD25 nice products. What can I say? I follow Michael since I was a child and he always gives me goosebumps. This song is particularly beautiful and I remember when he used to sing it live... Jeee what a memory! I miss you Michael. I created a site together with my partner, to keep his legacy alive, We added collectibles and memorabilia starting from Jackson 5 era! go there and enjoy! www.MJJCollectors.com
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this movie. I am a big die hard fan and this movie just fell short
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great book. Couldn't wait to turn the page! Kept me up reading it! I've never read anything by her before but I will now
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, since it's a Shrek spin-off featuring one of my favorite characters.  But it lacked the spark of the Shrek movies, and the plot really dragged along. I probably would have fallen asleep watching this in a movie theater!
B008PZZV8S|3.0|While Matt Damon and Jude Law were terrific, I was disappointed that the filmmakers felt the need to make Ripley sympathetic.  In the original novel, Ripley was not a sympathetic character and it's unfortunate that the producers and Minghella sold out in the end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app.  It supplies daily and weekly weather updates, as well as any warnings or alerts in the area. It's also very easy to use.
B00BFV1K2A|5.0|I watched the 1st movie of the Hunger Games and was left wondering what the???? Since reading the trilogy I understand not just the 1st story but fell in love not just with the story but also the heroin. A must for any one with an imagination and into futuristic novels
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|These are not workouts for intensive training, but if you only have 5 or 10 minutes to work out, they are perfect.  I also like the variety included, so I'm not bored doing the same exercises each time.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|The story was great and the kids were creepy. However, the pacing of the movie was a bit off and everything seemed rushed at the end.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|It was probably one of the finest movies ever made. Each movie gave you more and more excitment, and left you wanting more and more.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|this is a very fun and entertaining movie. I recommend it to the Trek/geek crowd or just about any other crowd for that matter. You only need to have a good sense of humor.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't believe how ch ended this amazing series:( after falling in love w these characters and getting invested in their development we get a horrible close that none of the fans wanted. Why not end the series after the second book if sookie was going to end up w Sam?!?! Why have the romance w Eric at all? So disappointed! At least I've got True Blood, mayb they will end the tv show the way the books should have ended; sookie and Eric forever!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I watched Beautiful Creatures last night. As a movie goes it was good I suppose. But I think I would have been at sea with some of it if I hadn't read the books.<br /><br />I wish that I had seen the movie before I read the books. I feel that the movie is the type that may make you seek the books out. If that is the case please do so because the movie is not one tenth as good as the books were.<br />Stohl and Garcia are wonderful world builders and the books are such a treat.<br /><br />That being said I know that there are few movies that are or can be completely true to the book they are based on but in this case it was so loosely based that it is nearly a different story. Too bad they didn't plan to make several like the Potter movies or even Twilight. Gives them more options to really use the books. Even LoTR took a few liberties but after the initial grrrr I found I could live with them.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I loved the character of Amma and I have no idea why they felt the need to re-form her character. I pictured her as a little old lady never once was she described as anything that would make me think she was a middle aged African American with scarification marks on her back. She was always described as prim and dressed for church. And where was her spoon with the hole in the middle of it?? The only person I saw cook was Ethan. Her cooking and her interaction with Ethan were such a large part of the book. Not to mention her own Amma-Magic. They also left Marilyn who was the Keeper out made her a composite character with Amma. grrrr.<br /><br />Ridley was a much nicer character and the movie misses a lot of what Ridley was a Caster. Not to mention she doesn't look anything like the authors described her. Why? Not like it was rocket science.<br /><br />The eyes. C'mon. Contacts? I am sorry but why on earth didn't they do that. The eyes are such a huge part of the story.<br /><br />The cast however I did enjoy. They worked well together and if it weren't for the consolidation of characters and the haphazard way they portrayed some of the others I would give it a higher rating. Not a totally terrible movie (well the ending was completely invented out of whole cloth) but if you have loved the books you will probably sit there when the movie is finished saying.... What?
B009NY43NY|1.0|Would that I could even say that nostalgia would have made the taste of this rancid and insipid ending leave my mouth, but it couldn't. In fact, nothing could remove the poorly written words from my tablet. I almost wished that I had purchased a hard cover version of this so I could have returned it and not had to claim it as something I own.<br /><br />Even if I could get past the cop out of Sookie's relationships, my suspension of disbelief was threatened repeatedly by the sloppy way that the Sookie universe was treated. I fail to understand how a telepath suddenly requires seeing someone's face to know whether or not they are telling the truth as well as several other glaring issues that popped up.<br /><br />I feel sorry for Ms. Harris--obviously, her passion and love for her characters came to a screeching halt. My love for them had not, though. I simply refute this book and its premise. It does not exist in my reality.<br /><br />I highly suggest you do the same and do not bother to purchase this. Do not let it be part of your reality.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|She loves it!  It keeps her interest for a while so I can get things done around the house.  She uses it at her house too.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|Good times for the family- the kids loved it.  Especially the jelly bean poop part and similar jokes.  We watched this on Easter.
B008602KQI|5.0|My Kids Loved it and would watch it again and again if I would let them. I can't wait for the second movie to come out!
B000NOKA0S|5.0|I really should not say this as it is his first and many would take issue with the statement that it is his best.  At the very least, it helped make his career what it is.  It gave him and us a chance to enjoy so more.  My favorite songs are on this his first album:  Suzanne and the Gambler.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book was good in my opinion. A lot of longtime followers of the series that I have talked to weren't impressed with this book as with the first three books in The Song of Ice and Fire. I also don't think this book can compare to the pace and intrigue of the first three books but it is much much better than a Feast for Crows. I am hoping GRRM will bring back the magic from the first three books and not over think The Winds of Winter.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Loved the show wish there more  season's ,would recommend this to anyone who likes period movies .the characters were great.
B000W4RFHK|1.0|A guy who thinks he's God, enjoys free sex and drugs, and likes to preach about how his version of Buddhism and Christianity connect via poetry while wandering around in self-obsession to the neglect and harm of others.  Enter the Dharma Bum.<br /><br />Sure, a work like this is valuable if you want to understand the mindset that says that nothing can be understood.  But besides that, I can't really think of any great redeeming qualities.  The thought that kept coming to my head was: \\"would the world really be a better place if everyone lived like there is no reality and avoided responsibility like the plague?\\"  I think Kerouac idealizes the lifestyle, but in the reality that the writer seems desperate to escape from, we see the harm that it brings to others (i.e., the girl who commits suicide instead of being watched and the mother who is left to fend for herself financially while her husband and son go off to dance around a campfire and live the Dharma Bum lifestyle).
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I lke any type of Mahjong, and this one is very good. Has a lot of shapes you can play and it is challanging.
B002Z8IWMS|2.0|Nothing too amazing here.  Keep it simple and avoid technical jargon.  Use 3 points.  Don't bullet point a bunch of facts.  Use images on the screen.  Use verbal images too.  Be real.  Make opportunities out of mistakes.  That's really about it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Fun addicting game that is definitely worth 99 cents. Easy to control and some challenging puzzles. A game to check out.
B0095P3ULC|5.0|My son loves transformers, whereas, I'm not a fan...at all. Having grown up on a selective tv diet of marvel/dc characters, and changing the channel every time the transformers cartoon came on....I can't bring myself to even TRY to get into this blast from the past film.<br /><br />My son however likes transformers(I blame relatives who brought transformers toys to our house/ I screen toys more heavily now :P) and asked to watch it. I obliged, because I was tired and needed to take a nap. I don't know what happened in the movie, what the plot consists of, or which robot is on the cover...but from what my son said....it's something to do with a bumblebee robot and thus making it a GREAT movie
B00CWM3F4C|2.0|All I have to say is that this band shouldn't be using the Alice in Chains name. I'm so tired of listening to Jerry Cantrell's ego(and singing) ruin this band. Their sound is more modern pop rock. There are few killer riffs. No great guitar solos(not that there ever were any in Alice). Duvall is a decent singer, not great but adequate. As a fan why we are forced to listen to Jerry Cantrell sing just baffles me. It's getting old. He never has been a good singer and still isn't. This is the last Alice cd I'll buy. In my opinion Alice 2.0 are trashing their heritage.
B007NZQU72|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who identifies as being &#34;highly sensitive.&#34; Even if you don't find everything in the book helpful, it will get you thinking and understanding what it means to be highly sensitive. A lot of things you might not have liked about yourself previously will start to make sense.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I would recommend this show for anyone who would actually like high quality drama, excellent writing, and keeps you on the edge of your chair!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Growing up on Excitebike and other side-scrolling racing games, I was sure I'd love this game. After hours of play and a ten minute swear-a-thon, I'm still in love with it! I highly recommend!
B00CE004XM|5.0|The most unbelievable guitarist teamed with the hottest singer.  What could be more sublime. Better than the first album which was great!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Have been play this game for a couple months...Love competing again the family.graphics are nice. Just watch out when you start to go faster.
B0045HCJRG|4.0|I had some tough financial times and had to sell most of my movie collection. This is one of the few movies I wish I hadn't sold. There should be a blu ray release. Any way I watch this movie at least three times a year. It always seems fresh, even though it doesn't hold any surprises. only four stars because it's not bluray.
0307895475|4.0|Book had some folded pages. Not a big deal, does the job it was meant to do. Thank you very much!
B003IWYOF4|4.0|The people in this movie are representatives of every person who has ever gone to high school. There isn't at least one person you can't relate to. The bonus features are good. I especially liked the interviews with most of actors.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Upon listening to their debut album, I realized just how accustomed I've grown to the band's new sound. Or really, their sound has always been about the same, but the intricacies, work, melodies, have all become more complex and professional. Let's face it, Hybrid Theory is clearly a rap-rock album for emotional teens. It's great, but it's wore out over the years. I believe this CD brings us back the polish of the Meteora album, the energy of Hybrid Theory, the experimentation of Minutes to Midnight, and the techno dance feel of A Thousand Suns. When the band says they mixed their previous albums' efforts into one album, they hit the nail on the head. Whether you are an old LP fan, new LP fan, or both, you're gonna enjoy this album!
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Thought I was really going to like this. Then I tried to use it when I was out & about about only to discover it wouldn't run without WIFI. Deleted it & never went back.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rate this book five stars because it was very descriptive and hilarious. This series is a good set for kids who LOVE to read.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|The mom was too annoying to sit through this movie. Not one to write bad reviews but I really could not enjoy this one
B008LZHA3G|3.0|Evidently the writer of this claim never heard Dylan's Christmas albumn. It was one of the worst collections of music-making known to humankind.
B000NGTJTY|1.0|Waste of a great cast. Another self indulgent Martin Scorcese film. Actors seem to enjoy developing their characters but you won't.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|First off, Marisa Tomei. End of review. Buy it. But really, this movie is great. It never bores you. There is a decent twist at the end that's not cheesy. Video quality is also great.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|i like special edition , specialy those with a small bust and this one is verry good, and of course de movies are great
B000YMJA7I|5.0|There are several songs in this that I wouldn't have listened to if I hadn't bought this album. If you don't have much of a G&R collection you should get this.
0785153322|3.0|The book is great but there are too much draw pictures instead of real pictures from the movies, I wish the next ones will be with pictures of the movie.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|This movie held our interest to the end.  It was not one of those predictable, formula types.  Helen Hunt did a great job.  The nudity was always done in good taste.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|My finger is sore! Galaga, space invaders, centipede, and bunches of stuff i don't know all combined. Long live sore fngers!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I would recommend this book to a friend.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I think that in order for this to be a decent calculator ot needs square root options. Also there could be a exponent sign.
B00701897I|1.0|I bought this, without going to the movie theater first.  Big mistake.  Another example where the story, technology and 3D do not deliver.  My son was sleeping within 30 minutes.  Do not give this as a gift, that person will hate you and remember you for the rest of his life.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Don't like how you have to be connected to Facebook. Other than that this games is alright. Will continue to play this.
B00AS1Q93S|3.0|While it seems that most folks feel that Mr. Cruise pulled off the Jack Reacher character, I just can't make myself accept it.<br />As an action movie this one was fine but as a movie around the Jack Reacher character it just didn't work for me.  Mr. Cruise is too<br />short and not nearly fearsome enough to make it work.  He did hold back his usual \\"quirky\\" smirk but still came across as a bit of a<br />sarcastic observer.  All in all not a great outing for those who have the Jack Reacher character set in their imagination.  It might<br />have been better to call the movie and lead something else because as I said it was an okay action flick.
B001BANK32|5.0|I first read this book back when it came out in the Carter Administration. I just finished rereading it. We had seen the Stanley Kubrick version of it on TV in the few past weeks. I remembered that the book was better than the movie, and the movie didn't get into the story deeply enough. I also wanted to be ready for the new film version when it comes out.<br /><br />Still five stars! I had forgotten a lot of the details so a lot of the story was new again. Steve the Sleep Stealer is at work again!<br /><br />Another interesting thing I noticed that as good as the book is, I could tell it was SK's third book. He still hasn't whet his writing tool to the sharpness it would have when he wrote It and The Stand. Also some of the language would be inappropriate today.<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching Jack Torrance's descent into madness again!
B008OM0EDO|3.0|A good movie if you just want to laugh at mostly political humor. It is an easy let me do more than just sit here and watch this film kind of movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|when I load this game it just dousnt load at all it just brings me back to home screen it a horrible app.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|hate it it wont load because i dont have enough memory but i detleted every app it wasted 6 bucks
B00A7YZ1KI|2.0|Having been a devoted follower of not only this series but Charlaine Harris in general I was very surprised at the low quality of this novel.  It seemed to lack the lightness that her books normally have, it almost seemed like it was a chore to write.  Yes it wrapped things up but that was about the only thing that was good about it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It took me awhile to figure it out, but once I did I found the game relaxing! I think I would have finished the game sooner had my son stopped stealing my kindle. Definitely waiting for the next chapter to come out!
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|This isn't my normal genre to read but heard the hype and decided to risk it and boy did it pay off.  These books are fantastic, hard to put down and gripping.  Have now reread the books at least 3 times and still enjoying them.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural has just the right blend of horror, the occult, and humor. Dean provides lots of comic relief amid the blood and gore. There is a lot of blood and gore. The angel, Cass, is lovable, and his innocence is both touching and funny, at times. Sam is the brooding, serious type, and I find him the better looking of the two brothers, who are demon hunters, as their mother, and father, and grandfather were. I have really enjoyed watching the 8 seasons of Supernatural and look forward to the next season. I was surprised that a show of this subject matter has lasted 8 seasons. Check it out, but watch a whole season before making up your mind. It is a continuing story, and my bet is after watching one season, you will be hooked, as I was. I am a senior citizen, and, although I suspect this series was aimed at a much younger target audience, I have found it very entertaining on several levels. Just don't question some of the plot twists too much. Sometimes it borders on ridiculous, but just accept it. After all, it is not supposed to be real. It's for fun.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Couldn't be happier with the whole streaming experience. It was easy to order up the movie, we had no issues at all streaming it through our DSL connection, the price was right, and the movie was a huge hit with the whole family. I know I sound like like an Amazon advertising copywriter, but it really was flawless all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|since I love horses this is the host one ever!! people should play this more often.it works and makes you feel alive.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Great for soothing my kids when they're over tired or me for that matter. Love the ability to mix and match sounds.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I guess I can't get over Tom Cruise playing Reacher it is the mismatch of the century, nevertheless I enjoyed the book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Very good insights and clarifying examples, it is like dissecting the essence of habits, highly recommended for personal and profesional life
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thought this game was brilliant! Just wish it could have lasted longer! Nice to find a new style of game to play and I can't wait for the next one :) hurry up with it please! Lol
B001NHNG64|5.0|Lee Child has made a great character in Jack Teacher He does need a more informed weapons an military person. Clock pistols do not have safeties.<br /><br />Love his writing!
B003EYVXTG|3.0|The story evolves around a very heroic and brave girl as she does what is necessary for her family. The extended family is weird. There are times when family ties are evoked in kindly ways and also otherwise.<br />There is offensive language.<br />This would appeal more to younger than older viewers.
B0056TYT66|5.0|No problems under Windows 7 or Windows Home Server 2011. Vastly improved the speed of my SSD over the built in SATA II ports on my PC.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|An interesing and varied assortment of older people for equally varied and assorted reasons find themselves together at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which is run by a very exuberent young man. The story evolves as their lives intersect.<br />Older viewer would most enjoy this although younger viewers should find it interesting also.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This story is great! It was a fun read. I was laughing so hard. Loved the book! Romance with a nice kick :-)
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Overall a good book, but the most exciting part of the book happened way to early and the story seems to drag on after that.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|So much better than the movie.  I'd definitely recommend reading the book before watching the movie.  Once I started reading this one, I couldn't put it down!
0345543971|5.0|The best book in the series by far.  Daunting page count at first, but once you're in it, you'll wish it was even longer.
B00C061I3K|1.0|Boring and unexciting, and really, not very original. In general, the music has no hooks, no edge, no hard beats. Some of it reminds me of Kraftwerk, but only the song Get Lucky reminds me of Daft Punk. The rest of the songs are so drastically different from the other work released under the Daft Punk name that they really should have been released/promoted as a separate project. The jazz, funk, and disco elements are too much for my taste, to where they dominate the music instead of otherwise being incorporated into a defining EDM style. Fans of easy and soft jazz will like this album. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if a few of the songs receive airplay on such radio stations.<br /><br />I also have to say I'm really disappointed with the title of the album - a creative pun appealing to tech-nerds - versus the actual songs and their titles. Obviously I inferred something very different for an album titled RAM.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|a good pass the time game and it works your brain!!!!  wish there were more we could dowmload like this..
B001B6PBBK|1.0|it lacked a story line aside from the character hated being in relationships. It really didnt make much sense. Glad i saw it for free
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! Love it!<br /><br />Great visuals, action packed, etc<br /><br />Honestly waiting for Avengers 2.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|nice. relaly helpful. easy to use on my kindle fire really good for telling u when u need to charge it. love how u can change the battery Colorado ( ;
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The story sucked me in from the beginning and held me fast throughout! Enjoyed the pace as well as the character development. Looking forward to the sequel!
0345803493|1.0|Where is the PLOT??? Reasonable PLOT? Very plain, boring, annoying, repetitive, not believeable story. If you take out the countless=boring sexual scenes it is a &#34;Cinderela=Anastasia (really outof all names..she picks ANASTASIA?) Story for kids&#34;. It almost felt like the purpose of the author was to get under your skin, &#34;insatiably&#34; sucking your patience out of your blood stream and drive you insane!!! Seriously..I could picture her &#34;Gymnast inner goddess&#34; going to Olympics and winning the all-arounds:) Holly Crap, Jeez, Whoa, Double Crap....Half way thru book 1, I had to google the author and read some reviews. I wish I did it before hand. Out of curiosity and because it is so easy nowadays to get hold of e-books, I got it...Well, surprise - surprise!!!  Everysingle nerve of my body has been irritated. I have never been more annoyed with a book in my life. Moreover, this is the first time I will have to drop it. I simply cannot pull myself together and make it thru Darker. This book suffocated me. I could not skip fast enough thru &#34;frown, flush, blush, Jeez, Whoa...&#34;.<br />Enough is enough!!!!!!<br />My inner Goddess Frowned and Screamed at me: Please STOP this madness!!!!! I frowned back, of course; did not forget to roll my eyes, shovel some food in my mouth, press my lips....touch my copper hair and surrender:)
B000002L9Y|4.0|Recently got back into vinyl and I was at a used record/CD store when I saw this album for five bucks. Rumours is one of my favorite records and I decided for the low price I should try some of the classic lineup's other albums.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much from this particular album, although \\"Little Lies\\" and \\"Everywhere\\" are two of my favorite FM hits. However, this is a very good album that could be great if not for a few mediocre songs, the worst of which can be blamed of Stevie. Her \\"When I See You Again\\" is lifeless and repetitive. It mostly consists of her repeating the word \\"baby\\" ad nauseum. The title track is also pretty bland. But the good tracks here make up for those disappointments, most notably \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Caroline,\\" and \\"Isn't It Midnight.\\" The song I hate to love of course is \\"Family Man\\", with laughable lyrics but a pretty catchy beat. It's probably the most 80s sounding track the band ever made and that's surprisingly not a bad thing here.<br /><br />Overall it's a very enjoyable album that will probably spend a lot of time on my turntable.
B007712XAU|3.0|I have not watched all six discs yet but already one of the discs that I watched was scratched bad enough that part of the program was skipped.
B005KELQEU|3.0|Its okay I would have gotten something now after receiving it. I figured it being a Belkin it would be good but honestly I dont think this case would protect my kindle that much. I would get the logic case instead.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was incredible. It really captured me and I couldn't put it down. This book made me feel happy or sad depending what was going on. There were some very big surprises and never a dull part.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is ridiculously engrossing! Even after all of the madness came and settled there was yet even more. I recommend this book to anyone that loves suspense, mystery, thrill, and crazy twists, this book will take you on a crazy ride.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|A great quirky show to add to hours of pure entertainment bliss. Definitely check it out , it is worth it.
B000I9YLUI|4.0|Although you will enjoy 1000 more reading the book rather than watching the movie. I think it is a very good movie.<br />They modified some of the dialogues but I think it is the way to do it because at the end there is not enough time in a movie. I must say that I love this story so I have watched both series (1980 and 1995) and now this movie. I love Colin Firth playing Mr. Darcy but this new Mr. Darcy from the movie is very passionate that it makes impossible do not fall in love with him.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A remarkable story of two young aviators, one a German fighter pilot and the other an American bomber pilot, who met in the skies above Germany during World War II.  What transpired was remarkable as the American pilot attempted to nurse his badly battle damaged B-17 out of German skies to the safety of England. This story is told from both sides of the conflict as we learn about both pilots and the circumstances that brought them together.<br /><br />An easy read full of triumph and defeat.  Highly recommended.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|The post apocalyptic world and the futuristic sci-fi scenes were incredible, entertaining, and well done. However, it seems like the producers of this movie tacked on the homosexual aspects of the movie just for the sake of pandering to that specific group. With that said those scenes are so incredibly annoying and grossly out of place, that it practicially ruins the rest of the movie. \\"Pheasant with the most delightful buttercream\\". If you want to watch a good movie that doesnt force a societal agenda down your throat, then this is not the movie to watch.
B00BRPDO14|5.0|I first became aware of Jose Gonzalez through his cover of Massive Attack's \\"Teardrop.\\" Since then I've really liked everything I've heard that he's been involved with, especially Junip.  This album continues the feel established with 2010's Fields.  Sort of a 6:30 on a summer afternoon feeling...laid back, but with soul...mellow, but not tiresome.  Close in sound and feel to Gonzalez's work with Zero 7's The Garden.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The book was great, it kept you guessing about what would come next. The ending was sad but gratifying. I have enjoying every book I've read written by Nicholas Sparks.
0812982622|4.0|The story is very dense with many things happening on every page. I found the whole book very well crafted, the way the story lines diverge and come together. It gives a lot to think about. Questions like 'is it true', 'how can the writer write about North Korea without having lived there' did not prevent me from reading it. Parts of the book seemed surreal anyway. One of  the messages of the book is about freedom. In that sense I think it is a very american book.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This is a fun game to play.  It doesn't take a lot of skill, just a great way to relax.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|LOVE THE SERIES. fast loading time. No complaints at all besides season 5 wasn't available for free streaming when i wanted to watch it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Comes in handy when I don't have my fire with me and have a few minutes to catch up on my book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Pro: colorful and relaxing Con:slow to build improvements overall: worth a try. Adults may find it lacking any real challenge but anyone who liked the movie or interested in basic oceanography should find it worth the storage space.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an amazing app, there are so many fun ideas. Because of my MS I'm on permanent disability, meaning I'm home with nothing to do. This has been an inspiration and an amazing help to me to find things to do. It keeps me nice and busy. If it wasn't for Pinterest I'd be bored and depressed. Thank you!!
B0079IEPHA|5.0|My husband and I I look forward to getting home and watch Suits together! My compliments to the writers of this show.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked it but the first two were better. I also didn't really care for the ending. It was rather depressing.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I really like this case because not only does it protect the Kindle but it makes holding it a lot easier.
0765325950|5.0|well, I've been reading this series for about 10 years now. I waited a long time for the finish. Brandon Sanderson did a great job rapping it up. It's a thrill and a page turner.
B003XQ9BXU|4.0|great action packed movie with romance, humor and an unusually strong female lead and with Russell Crowe as lead man how could you go wrong?
B003O86FMW|4.0|Kept me going, I couldn't put it down. they really threw a wild twist into it at the middle and the end
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This is an outstanding book about how life really is in North Korea. I highly recommend it as required reading for teenagers. How fortunate we are to live in a free country.!
B001MEJY8W|1.0|I bought this movie in the r-rated version.I have never seen a more graphic display of disgusting horror in my life.I am a horror movie fan and I have seen them all.I watched the whole movie and almost got sick to my stomach.Then I heard about the unrated version so I bought and watched it too.The un-rated is worse than the r-rated version.I actually threw up in my waste basket.This is one movie that should of been banned in every country in the world.I threw both copies in the trash.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|it is a good fun game. very addivtive. if you have problems with time management don't get it, but if you don't care about loosing your life, go for it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This is my second book in a row now written from the male's POV and I have to say I really have liked it both times.  I loved being able to hear his reasoning behind things and where he was coming from and watching him slowing fall in love.  His thoughts were hilarious many times and I would read parts over to my husband.  This is the story of a guy who women have always came to very easily and who has never formed any sort of attachment to any of them.  Then he meets Kate and of course she changes everything.  On the surface that synopsis sounds very similar to lots of other books out there and I really thought about skipping this one but I'm glad I didn't.  I think what makes this one different is reading everything from the male's POV and just the absolute hilarity of many of his thought processes.  Plus the heroine in this story is pretty amazing also.  Both characters as well as the secondary characters are very likeable.  This is a funny, sweet but hot love story.  It wasn't dark and the people weren't both completely screwed up from past events etc.  I think sometimes this can be refreshing though.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|Enjoyed beautiful quaint town. Julianne played a great role. I would recommend this movie to friends. I actually watched it twice.
B00114RKT8|5.0|Very inspiring movie based on a true story. Very uplifting, we enjoyed it. A story of courage and Faith. I highly recommend it!
B00628RVV0|5.0|shows courage and passion..shows how difficult those times were and if we are not careful, it could be repeated again
B004U8VX2M|2.0|I started out thinking this would be like Downton Abby and there were similarities, but, advancement in video and costumes have made Upstairs, Downstairs too dated to enjoy.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|comedy and drama..Jessica Tandy was such a wonderful actress and to achieve fame at her age was such a joy,
1476712042|2.0|Plot: I liked the sound of the plot on paper but it was poorly executed by Jamie McGuire. I felt I was on a ride at a amusement park and it kept going around and around in circles before reaching a terrible ending. The relationship fits the name perfectly but there was really nothing beautiful about it, one would get drunk and angry anytime they had a fight and the other would always complain about how bad he was for her but kept going back. I didn't really think Abby's past storyline paid off too well. I was expecting something different but what we got made me ask 'That's it? Why is she so pissed at Travis then?'. I honestly did not see how her past made Travis bad for her, he was bad for her in different ways. The way the book ends was laughable at best and I could have thought of several different ways to make the ending a little more enjoyable for the reader that stuck with this book until the very end.<br /><br />Characters: Abby and Travis are two of the most frustrating characters I have seen in a book. Abby did nothing but use people early on in the novel and Travis, who clearly felt something for Abby, never had the courage to stand up and tell her how he felt. I hated how anytime something happened Travis got drunk and punched things and then said he was sorry the next day. Abby always said he was bad for her but she kept going back. The two friends in the book really added nothing extra, they were just there to stop fights and cause extra drama.<br /><br />Overall: Doesn't really add anything new to the YA genre and Jamie's writing is OK at best. I don't regret reading the book but it is one of the worst books I've read this year (and the ending is the worst ending I have read in years)! I would say to only read this book if you want a story about a violent relationship that ends just the way you thought it would, but thought it would be handled differently. 2/5 Stars
B004XVN1T4|5.0|A real page turner! Surprise twists and turns. Some love interest but mostly lots of action. The good guys win!,!!
B008QMMEOE|5.0|In the span of about 2 weeks, my 2-1/2 year old has gotten really good at this game.  He ADORES it.  Seriously talks about it all the time.  I was really impressed how quickly he learned what to do.
B000SEHJGQ|3.0|Some parts of the story was amusing and funny but the bulk of the book was too slow moving.  I understand that was how life was during those days but it could have focused on more of the funny events of childhood.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I want to make it clear that I'm not a big fan of books. However, Fifty Shades is such an enchanting story. Yes, it is known for the intense red room scenes, but it is so much more than that. It's a love story that will captures your attention and has you cheering for the relationship to be \\"more\\". Addicted to the series.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|It has all been said, and more thoroughly and eloquently than I can add, this was truly disappointing and a sad end to the series. For details (and spoilers if you need to know that kind of thing) see the reviews by Tracey, Charlotte and Life Long Reader...they have said it all and I have commented further in support.  If you are/were a fan, stick to the first 6 -8 books and leave the rest to your own imagination....
030746363X|5.0|Love that this is a realistic approach to a better body, on so many different levels. Definitely a worth while investment.
B005LAIHY0|2.0|It wasn't scary, the plot incoherent, the characters unbelievable, and the effects fairly Syfy Channel.  Good movie to cure insomnia
1936891026|5.0|This book is a great if you have any artistic motivation, which should be almost everyone. It is a quick read and to the point. It makes a lot of sense. Read this, it is worth your time.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|It starts out really simple but becomes quite a challenge.  Good brain exercise.  Can become addictive if you play it long enough.
B00BU18U82|5.0|I have three boys and they LOVE it.!  More realistic than other farm games, and a little more challenging.  They love earning new equipment, and choosing crops.  I am not thrilled about the option to purchase more coins....I prefer and insist that they earn their way by selling their crops.  I bought them each 1 million coins and are having them use them wisely.<br /><br />Farming Mom
B00AEUU4LQ|2.0|I wanted to like this book. Perhaps my expectations were to high. Khaled's first two novels The kite runner and AThousand Splendid Suns were amazing.  Echoed just lacked the character development.  Just when you were getting involved In a storyline the book would meander off on a different tangent.  I wanted more of Abdullah and Pari as children. How did the tragedy of separation shape their lives. Instead fast forward 40 years. I felt there was never a chance to get to know any of characters and the story lines, except Nabi,  were not always interesting. I was hoping for more and it just didn't deliver.
055380684X|5.0|I've always been a little disappointed that in America, the land of self-made men and women, we still talk so much about talent as a genetic anomaly that we either have at birth or we don't. This book identifies the processes by which athletes and other performance artists develop the skills that other people later label as talent. It shows the mental and  physical processes that allow the development of skills. It points out the fallacy of the &#34;your brother was a good athlete, so you must be, too&#34; type of thinking that is rampant in youth sports.Buy a copy for your child's coach immediately and make sure he/she reads it.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Well, Lee Child has done it again.  Here is another five star Jack Reacher adventure.  Here is a guy who doesn't care for attachments of any kind yet he manages to get involved again and again.  This one was another page turner where you try to figure out what is going on and how Reacher will get himself out of the situation with his skin more or less intact.  If you like mystery and adventure this one if for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 5 year old got me addicted to this game. When will the Miami game come out for the Kindle? I hope soon
B00BYISQTO|5.0|I have been a fan of The National since I downloaded Boxer from emusic.com 5 or so years ago.  Many call their songs \\"growers\\" cause you listen to it over and over again, but aren't quite sure why because it isn't obviously great, yet when you wake up in the morning all the songs are still rolling thru your head so you listen even more.<br /><br />So once finally \\"got\\" Boxer and I quickly devoured Alligator and the other previous releases by the band.  I was in LOVE!<br /><br />Then High Violet came out and I was disappointed. It was like seeing someone you love for the first time in years and something had changed. High Violet was too dark for me. Too direct, in your face depressing.  Every song almost. Depress me some more please!  No thank you.  I appreciate High Violet but it is not for me and probably near the bottom of my list of albums. Don't get me wrong, I can listen to some songs from it, but listening to the whole CD at once is emotionally exhausting. If you read interviews with Matt (singer) he will even say those lyrics were hard for him. But for this new release they flowed like blood.  The difference is obvious.<br /><br />When the band released a teaser of Trouble Will Find Me a month or two back with \\"Demons\\" I wasn't thrilled. Maybe it was the streaming quality. I was thinking, eh, more of the same High Violet vibe and was sad cause my love affair with the band would be wrecked.<br /><br />But no. I bought this about 10 days ago and have been listening often. After the first listen I knew they were back. Songs with beats that draw you in and make you not care about the words, until one day a special lyric catches your ear and the song as a whole becomes clear. Mellow songs that you know you'll need to hear 20 times before you really get the feeling from it and then you'll wonder how you didn't love it upon first listen.  Lyrics that seem to make sense but not really and you're not sure they ever will.  But you break down and find the lyrics for that song online and then Poof, the song is brilliant.<br /><br />If you are reading this and have no idea what I am saying, you must be new to The National. If you are a fan, you will totally get what I am saying.  And hopefully you have already bought or will be buying this CD soon!
0486475824|5.0|Exactly the picture and description. A great book and at a great price. Recommend for any ages, but probably a high school level read.
B009R659L8|5.0|I am never amazed by the way she writes.I enjoyed reading all her books. I just read them so fast that I have to wait for her next one.
B00AWJYJVA|3.0|None of his greater novels, but still a good piece of work. The end simply is not there, and is missing. We are all getting old...
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Surprisingly addictive, cool mix of Bejeweled and rpg. I also appreciate the mercy of the fact that it's possible to get to freedom in a reasonable time and break the addiction :)
B004IPPINW|3.0|This book gives a plausible description of how people from the non-western world see things. Having lived a few years in a Muslim World I appreciate this effort. The composition and technique used is a bit dull...
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The three books are intrguining, however, the writing is AWFUL! It's worth a read because they are quick and easy but, as an avid reader, they are not as good as everyone claims.
B004RKXHZY|5.0|I just finished reading Stephanie Perkins' second novel, 'Lola and the Boy Next Door' and I absolutely adored it!! This book is adorable, witty and amazing. I read 'Anna and the French Kiss' last summer and I had no idea how this book would compare, but after reading it I would say 'Lola and the Boy Next Door' is just as great as 'Anna and the French Kiss' if not better! I would recommend this book to anyone, even if they don't typically read YA or romantic books. This book is no 'Twilight'- it's real, funny, warm and captivating. I cannot wait to read Stephanie's next book, 'Isla and the Happily Ever After' when it comes out in September.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|The entire concept was unusual. A likeable and interesting protagonist and the strange man who came into his life at a crucial moment and led him down paths outside human awareness. Musings on life and death, Gods and people who believe in their Gods.

1579125549|5.0|I have owned this book for years and periodically revisit it. Each time I do, I am astonished at how perfect of a training tool it is! Like any other art or craft that one develops, practice and repetition is the way to technical mastery. Unfortunately, developing proper technique in chess (this means being able to clearly visualize all variations and refutations for a given move move one is considering) is what distinguishes masters from amateurs. This book forces you to do that.<br /><br />Being able to instantly recognize potential mates hidden in positions will also make it easier to figure out how to create the conditions for those positions to arise in games. It's so important to be able to instantly recognize mating nets at the board. How to create them and how to avoid them. Even grandmasters miss mates occasionally. Seriously, go through about 20 or so grandmaster games over the last 20 years with a a chess engine and you'll be surprised at how often mates are missed.<br /><br />It's hard for me to listen to the people saying to ignore the \\"composed\\" problems in this book. While chess compositions are typically positions that wouldn't arise in a normal game or require the consideration of unusual ideas, they are still of enormous didactic value. Shouldn't one be able to find a mate in any position? Shouldn't a true master be able to do that? Chess compositions often require a lot more thought and experimenting than standard mating patterns. The worst thing that can happen is that your visualization ability will improve.<br /><br />Also, the endgame studies and combinations toward the end of the book, along with the miniature games illustrating common opening inaccuracies make this a lifetime training companion.<br /><br />This book, along with detailed study of grandmaster games and long matches against computers will make you a chess machine.<br /><br />Buy it!<br /><br />(and solve the problems before bed!)
B009NY43NY|5.0|Unfortunately, this book series had to come to an end...  but what a ride!!!  Thanks for a great and predictable ending to a great story.  Can't wait to see what Charlaine Harris writes next.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Good job.Good job I enjoyed this product and everything was very good.  THANKS FOR for offering an excellent opportunity for me to buy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is not what I expected, but I'm so glad I read it. It's the most sad and tragic book I've ever encountered, but also by far the happiest and most hopeful. Careful to who reads it, you WILL cry. I sobbed. And there's a plot twist, which I LOVE. I never write reviews, but this book deserved one. Read it, you won't regret it.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Makes you think, makes you reminisce. Wonderful film albeit on the longer side. Highly recommended if you're looking for a great movie.
B0091CWYQ6|4.0|I've been using this microphone / remote control headphone adaptor on my iPhone for several months now and it's great. It's well built, easily controls my phone, and has a decent microphone. The housing is a solid metal tube. The cable is rugged (though it has one flaw I'll mention later). The clip works under most conditions without marring your shirt (or whatever you may clip it to). The controls are solid and easy to use. But the best part is that this is also a FiiO amplifier (with its own USB rechargeable battery). That's a nice plus for a junior audio snob like me. I'd been looking for a solution to pair with my awesome Audio-Technical ATH-EW9 headphones and this was the first adaptor that didn't look flimsy. And it's not. Everything about it is sturdy and because it's a FiiO amplifier the sound in your ears doesn't suffer like with other unpowered adaptors. One warning, which the instructions mention but I will reiterate: Always remember to turn off the amplifier before you unplug it from your device. If you neglect to you'll blow out your eardrums and or damage your headphones. The action of unplugging can cause a signal spike which will be pushed through the amp and into your headphones. This is true of almost any amp, so it's not a minus, just a caution.<br /><br />So, that's everything I like about them. There are two things that keep it from getting 5 stars. The minor one is that the Rocky is hefty. I'm used to it now, but at first it felt like it was pulling my shirt collar down. So you may need to click it in a different location than you normally would. The second is that while the jack is very solidly built, it has no stress relief for the cable.  If you keep your device out of your pockets, you shouldn't experience any issues, but in a pants pocket in particular you may end up kinking the cable at the jack. In my case this has caused sound balance issues. I can correct it by rotating the jack so the orientation is different, but I know I'll eventually have to replace it (FiiO doesn't refurbish these devices). It's not a deal breaker, but something to be mindful of if you buy one.ly have to replace it (FiiO doesn't refurbish these devices). It's not a deal breaker, but something to be mindful of if you buy one.
B009NY43NY|3.0|This book served to remind readers of Sookie's past relationships/friendships by parading them through Bon Temps with little plot advancement.<br /><br />Felt that the murder of Arlene and the attempted framing of Sookie for this murder was not believable.<br /><br />The wrapping-up of the end of Sookie and Eric's relationship and the beginning of Sookie and Sam's would have fit nicely at the end of the last book.<br /><br />I keep wondering if this final book was a contractual obligation of the author. I think she lost interest in this series two books ago.
B009NY43NY|3.0|But it's just as well that this is the final novel.<br /><br />Thank you, Charlaine, for a unique & enjoyable heroine.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I've never read a book quite like this one.  It really made me understand the power of words and the effects of war.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|One of the best-written and executed sci-fi series ever.  Second season further develops the conflict between the SGC and the System Lord Apophis, with several excellent stand-alone episodes mixed in.
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Slowly building to an intriguing tale but somehow no knock-out punch to lift it to a higher rating. Pleasant surprsie as I had not expected as much.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|there is no possible way not to love glee. the songs are awesome. you just end up singing along with the characters.
B004G0DN7W|5.0|It is an oldy but still awesome. SciFi meets western. I wasn't sure I would like it but I ended up loving it.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|the movie is a great installment to the silent hill games. you see what a daughter will do for the ones that they love definitely when it is your father.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|My daughter wanted to watch this movie and I thought well, it can't be<br />that bad and we were both scared out of our wits! lol I haven't been<br />scared about a movie in a really long time and this was the one that<br />really got me good. She wanted to watch it again. I'm like, no. lol The<br />suspense was great. It was gripping and kept your attention. Creepy!<br />I do not like Moths and now, I still don't! This movie had detail to it.<br />Worth watching if you want a great scare for fun!!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|you see what these girls are going through will the are being tortured by this mysterious A. but they still find time  to have a somewhat normal teenage lives
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The price and collection expectations for the items in the shop are a bit outrageous. Would love them to a little more affordable. Also would like more options for power ups.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|the movie is really good. if you seen the original then you will like this. you will want to get up and dance along.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This really is a great read.  i almost put it down half way through, feeling it had become a bit tedious.  however, upon finishing up a few extra chapters, i was struck by the turn of events, and understood how brilliant this book really is, and why it has become such a classic.  you won't, in the end, be disappointed.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|when you get the series you will not want to stop watching .... the drama ,the love . you are apart of the story from the begining
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The plot is a little uneven on first viewing, but a little easier to understand on second viewing. Cruise did an excellent job with the character, and Robert Duvall is a welcome surprise (I ascribe to Duvall what others call the &#34;M Emmett Walsh&#34; theorem -- there are no bad movies with Duvall in them!). A lot of action once the movie gets going. Great plot twists that you don't expect, especially the finale (I thought the bad egg was someone else!).<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable couple of hours that you shouldn't regret spending. Amazon HD streaming is top-notch, too -- no issues.
B004EPZ070|5.0|the movie is really good. you have people that have to learn to say what they feel. never leave anything for to late .
B009NY43NY|3.0|Unlike most, I liked the book overall. Without giving anything away, there was some good suspense, old characters characters (although some were in and out too fast to notice).  I thought the storyline itself was decent, pacts with the devil and all. The only two major disappointments were how Sookie and Eric fizzled like it was some high school romance (here today and gone tomorrow) and the ending. It was bad and deflating, it just seemed like she wanted to add this bit to the storyline but ran out of time (or effort) to make it flow properly.  Like it said though, overall I thought it was decent book.  I'm glad I didn't know that it was the last book while I was reading it though. I imagine my review would be more harsh because I would have expected so much more.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I've enjoyed Sookie for the entire series so far.  This one felt a bit too full of exposition.  It also felt a bit thrown together as a conclusion of her story.  I would have liked it to end with more of a bang.  It felt like the entire book should have been an epilogue to the previous book.<br /><br />Still a decent read for those of us who have kept with the story thus far.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I do like to play solitaire but it is not one of my favorite card games.  I like to play it occasionally though.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I have all the Ring movies, and, though I love the acting, the music, the artwork, the special effects, and all, the fight scenes dominate the movies and get monotonous. The Hobbit is the same. I enjoyed it but would rather see good drama instead of all the wars.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I do a lot of different Mahjong games.  I find them to be challenging.  This is a basic one that I do enjoy.  I have since found many others that are even more challenging.
B005HED08I|4.0|I bought this mainly because I was watching all the Star Trek movies and wanted to see how Kahn was brought to this planet. An interested episode.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the whole series, and I think the ending of this one makes it absolutely perfect. A great read.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I sold the kindle fire hd and bought an I pad mini and love it<br />It's pain to write theses reviews if you don't want to
0618918248|4.0|The author rightly presents the great importance of natural selection but denies the existence of any random process in evolution. Natural selection itself is not random. What works, works. However, what generates the alternatives among which natural selection selects? There is the possibility of a basically random process involved here. Also there would seem to be an element of chance that what the genes produce isn't compatible with what the environment allows. Finally whether the embryo turns out to be male or female looks very much like it could  be the result of a coin toss.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loved the Sookie Stackhouse series and if this is the last book, Charlaine Harris did a great job wrapping up all of the characters.  While still leaving enough wiggle room to your own imagination for their futures.<br />Thank you Charlaine for entertaining me!!  It would be nice if you had another Harper Connelly book to release.  Hinting:)
1451695195|5.0|Curious about heaven, read this book.  Written by a doctor who did not really believe in the afterlife. The book will open up your life here on earth.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Cruise showed much larger range than usual action/bang-bang mode<br />Kind of a sleeper...cerebral flick ...initially thought he was wrongly cast having read book but credible.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me just how good this show is. The characters are all amazing, each different, each complex. It's not your basic sci-fi drama. It's so much more: it brings up political issues, it questions traditional family structures, it even challenges the notion of who we are as people. Nothing is safe in Orphan Black and our saturdays are better for it!
B004IPPINW|3.0|I could not get into the story, very confusing.  I have to admit I gave up half way through, just could not continue with the story.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Ambling story, a bit hard with the dialect at times but enjoyable reading for the most part. Tracy la la
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  The character descriptions were right on, and at times very amusing.  Very good read in my opinion!
B003KRJNBW|4.0|And one could learn from (one man who fights to protect what is most important for !survival of the human race !)Love the ending !!

B0091REZMW|5.0|This is really good for a free game. Usually they have limits but as yet I haven't found any.<br />I haven't had it long so my opinion might change
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I really enjoyed this trilogy!!!<br />Each book offered more suspense to a great ending. Great read that kept me turning the pages.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I love the perfect design, slim, transparent, at the same time you keep it safe and it is charging.<br />That is amazing. Also keep the charge long time. I strongly recommend to everybody that has<br />bought the Plantronic Voyager Legend.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|There are few books that manage to play with the emotions, this is one of them.<br />Rather than talking about the action all the time, it explores the psycology of each country -citizens, army and government- into dealing or not dealing at all, with something totally out of their experience.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I never watched this on tv but I was on netflix and I was curious so I watched the first season and was hooked.Damien is soooo bad but sooooo sexy..and my sweetheart stephan is just delicious. The young lady elina she is cool too ..great movie..well I. Had to get season 2 &3 ..now I am waiting for season4.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Graphics are pretty stunning. I was once unable to download the game since I'm outside US and Amazon do not launch appstore in my country. Now I could play this wonderful game and hope Amazon would continue to let me consume her unique services.
0765325950|5.0|My son and I have spent twenty years with this story as have all fans of this remarkable story from Robert Jordan. Brandon Sanderson finished this story due to the passing of this great author, and he did a really wonderful job. I highly recommend this series of wonderful books to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Good quality, timely and a very good movie. It was a present to my husband and he was very pleased.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love John Green, and this is by far his best. Where Katherines, WGWG, an paper towns fall short TFioS is a stron literally masterpiece filled with heart, a gripping storyline, and lovable characters, as well as a few gut wrenching-ly funny moment. A must read for teens and adults.

B00338QENI|5.0|It has been a few weeks since I finished reading this book, which was recommended by my wife, whose book club took it on a few months ago.<br />What is described in this excellent book is something that - probably - couldn't happen today.  Without her knowledge and consent, or the knowledge and consent of anyone in her family, cells from the body of Henrietta Lacks were taken and used, and are still being used today, all over the world for scientific / medical research.<br />I wound up thinking that, although legal at the time, the lack of informed consent was a shameful event in otherwise enormously productive and successful research.
B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|It was interesting in this movie how the same though different people in particular aspects lived long ago and in the future. I especially liked the segment of Neo Seoul in the 22nd Century. This brutal and ruthless dictatorship gave one character from the past the opportunity to become a hero with the same though different woman when they were together in the mid-nineteenth century.Though most Americans don't believe in reincarnation (I reckion this was the reason it didn't succeed at the box office) I know it's a popular religious concept in other nations that if true makes life richer and more meaningful.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Like many people, I was introduced to fantasy fiction by the Game of Thrones series, and have been bouncing around to other books waiting for the next in that series to issue.  Where Game of Thrones gives a view from the top looking down, this series is bottom up -- a first person tale about the adventures of a young boy whose parents are killed by shadowy creatures and his quest to find those creatures -- it's a bit of &#34;Game of Thrones meets Harry Potter,&#34; with the Harry Potter showing strongest in the development of interesting characters -- both professors and friends -- at the protagonist's school.  It's also relatively clean -- though with some side references to brothels and the like -- so that I'd feel comfortable with teenagers reading it. (I don't want my daughters reading Game of Thrones until their 30s!).  At bottom, this series is second only to Game of Thrones in the fantasy area.
1575666286|5.0|Great great great, I can truly say that quite possibly this book has saved my life. Great buy, everyone should read this! and understand this, even if they decide to use other medical methods for their ailments
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I love what I am reading, but it goes slowly.  There are a lot of data and many references-- even for me and I'm a retired professor.  I plan to finish reading the book, because I feel I need the information, but not because it keeps me awake,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|awesomeness!! funny, suspenseful, and cute story. It can get you really hooked into the book. Couldn't stop reading it! Finished the book in 2 days!

B00CLH1PHM|4.0|Written with the same style and offbeat darker sense of humor, Whitehead has crafted a short story of intersecting lives: two actors, one famous one not so.  While Terry Sparkes is anxiously awaiting his own private Oscar viewing, the fickle hand of fate is highlighted in the contrast of the two careers.<br /><br />Duncan Whitehead has managed to cleverly integrate his full length mystery, The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club  in the Oscar story, and utilizes his humor and skill to craft a story that is the perfect accompaniment to savor with a cup of tea. A quick and clever short story that gives a nice feel for the author's style, and should encourage you to read more of his quirky characterizations that can be found in his novel.<br /><br />I received an eBook copy from the author for purpose of honest review. I was not compensated for this review: all conclusions were my own responsibility.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|AWESOME BOOK!!! I was totally hooked into the story. I couldn't stop reading it, that i ended up finishing it in 3 days!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very interesting and thought provoking.  Keeps me interested love that I can bing watch without commercials.  Great acting and storyline.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|What a beautiful series! The acting is superb. Mads Mikkelsen portrays Hannibal with a delightfully understated, atmospherically creepy tone. More subtle than Anthony Hopkins was. I'd even say Mads is the better Hannibal. Hugh Dancy is great as Will. Love Laurence Fishburne and Caroline Dhavernas. NBC would be foolish not to renew the series. Hoping for a soundtrack release as well. Hannibal is such a stylish show... Bryan Fuller is so under-appreciated. If the series doesn't get a second season pick-up, then hopefully another network will step in. Absolute can't miss TV.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I'm using this across one side of my Bumbleride Indie Twin, and it fits well. It's a great catch-all, & we like the two slots for drinks and the little zipper part in the middle for keys. It works well for us!
B00CL50LEC|2.0|Just could not get into the movie. I tried many times to watch it after I purchased it. Not as good as they made it out to be in the previews.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Not bad for a free app.<br />Colorful graphics,it gives you the time left for various apps (music,video,browsing).<br /><br />I don't like the ads but part of the deal for a freebie.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I felt so lucky to find this DVD. I'm a purist when it comes to Star Wars so the originals will always have a special place in my heart! Since the new versions have come out it's been difficult to find the original movies with the Bonus Material--and not for free either. My collection is complete, the disks were clean and played just fine in my machine at home. I'm happy. Thank you so much!
B006SMLAMQ|2.0|not to my liking. one weather app is much better. there are better weather apps and widgets available in the store.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing it in a theater. I love the characters. They are my age and I could relate but even young people liked it.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It started out good then just got so cliché after a while.  Not one of Tom's better characters. Sorry I paid to watch it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I read this years ago and recently saw the movie and had to read it again to see if it was the same. Most of it was but I believe in the book you get to hear more of his thoughts which were great.
B009NTNHJU|5.0|One of my favorite artist so y'all know I love the cd, DVD I haven't watched yet but I'm happy with it
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|I was nicely surprised. This movie did not disappoint. The acting is really good. Would watch it over and over again
B00BSBY38A|2.0|Movie was visually amazing, great animations and graphics and the movements of the animals are almost perfectly fluid, but not a movie I would tear down the doors to see.  Glad I rented it and didn't buy.
B00CFQN12Q|5.0|I have seen and owned all of the Die Hard movies at one time or another. If you have not seen it do so.

B002YCVX5S|5.0|Shortly after I had seen (and thoroughly enjoyed) Django Unchained, I made it a point to watch Inglourious Basterds. I had heard that it was a great movie, but I just hadn't gotten around to seeing it. Oh, what a mistake that was! I was entertained during the whole movie, and all of the actors do a superb job. Christoph Waltz played a superb villain, and he did a stellar job at it. Brad Pitt was very funny and entertaining, and he did a great job as well. For those of you that don't know, Inglourious Basterds takes place mostly in Nazi-occupied France. A Jewish girl owns a cinema in Paris, which happens to be the site of a German movie premiere. She hatches a plan to take down the Third Reich, and so do a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as \\"the Basterds\\". It plays out very well, and the dialogue is wonderful in this movie., Most of it is spoken in either German or French, so subtitles are obviously a very important thing here. I would highly recommend this movie to...well, just about everyone! There's some violence and gore in this film, but not a ridiculously excessive amount.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Good movie. Great story, kid acting was easy to watch. Very enjoyable! Some language but not overboard.  Reminded me of one my personal favorites, Stand By Me.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|I wanted to catch up on the episodes I missed before watching the ones I recorded.  I have a smart tv with the amazon instant play app. I was able to launch the app and stream the episode with no problems.  It was very easy to stream and easy to watch,  I also enjoyed the content of the video.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|what can i say?  i love love this movie and will probably wear it out watching it over n over
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is going to be a short review because one word sums 11/22/63 up for me and that word is 'perfect.' I enjoyed every word of it. I've never liked 'time travel' stories and if I saw those two words in a blip describing a particular book, I immediately lost interest and moved on. Despite the time travel aspect, the subject matter of 11/22/63 captured my imagination because it revolved around the Kennedy assassination. I downloaded the sample and was hooked.<br /><br />The plot is fast moving and compelling. The characters are equally compelling. I believed every one of them and I believed in time travel while reading the book. Suspension of disbelief was not a problem at all, which is in and of itself unusual for me. King made it believable. I was truly convinced. The ending was perfect as well. I was not disappointed as I so often am because of a seemingly hurried or unbelievable end. King got it right.<br /><br />I had a fantastic experience with this story. I probably haven't been that involved in a story since I was a child. I will read it again (and I don't usually revisit books I've read).<br /><br />Obviously, I highly recommend this title.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Fun watching this.  I have watched the show since it began and this season just reminds me why I love watching it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a warm and very inspiring book...we discussed it at our Book Club and everyone loved it.  Victoria had such strength even with all she had been thorough during her early life.  This book was well written and would like to read more from this author.

B004W1GCNC|5.0|Love it!  Wish there would have been more seasons!!  I don't understand why this showed didn't go forward!! Great show!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great premise, great cast and great acting.  Its got some mystery/cop show with strong courtroom drama. The plot is involved, maybe too complicated at times, but it keeps me interested.  I'm half-way through season 2 and still loving every episode!
B000IDEORY|5.0|i always wanted this movie . it's a great movie . and will be watching soon .and the price was great better then  store price
B000M5AJQS|5.0|This is the best mob movie.  Even better than The Godfather.  I like the two disk set.  Thanks for sending it to me so fast
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|A strong and most enjoyable collection of standards by Eliane Elias, consistently beautifully and lyrically pianoworked - as is her trade mark - and centred by her able, husky, carefully controlled (limited range) voice. The flugelhorn and trumpet work of Randy Brecker nicely punctuates several songs. All the songs without exception are of the same high standard. The album is well produced and sounds great on high quality headphones...a particular criticism I had with such fine albums as her earlier \\"Bossa Nova\\"  where the recording was not well separated and sounded very average for such a fine recording artist. This album is straight ahead jazz and well worth the 5 stars. (I wish she will come out with her San Janvier (Spain) recording of many years ago which seems completely unavailable and would be fitting equivalent to this album.)<br /><br />PS If you like Eliane Elias's paino playing, you might well enjoy Donald Vega's \\"Tomorrows\\" which has uncannily similar style and sentiments.
0670451495|5.0|Cannot wait to share this with our Great Nephew.  We love the book and it was written and sketched the year I was born.  Amazing that this book is still a favorite by so many people.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was very well written. I was sorry when it ended and will definately get the next book.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Good movie.  Wish everyone had the funds to travel all over the country to see the variety of birds they did.  Especially liked seeing pictures of all the birds that were seen.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Interesting and detailed, but unlike what I heard from some people before reading it, it is largely the same as the movie...so if you have seen the movie, there isn't much more that you will get out of the book.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Had a night at home with the family. The movie was good but I miss all the cool Q gadgets.
B00C5W3SBE|3.0|This is a good family movie.  My friends kids love this movie as well as their parents.  I really like the movie as well.  Nice entertaining movie, but the price that they are asking for $31, is ridiculous.. is utterly ridiculous.  So I say, until that price comes down to about 10 dollars less, just rent it... the price of where it stands reminds me of that video store in the malls that would sale movies for this ridiculous price... AND they think they are slick with the fake original cost of $44 .. to make you think you are saving money at the $31 range.<br />Now that is over, (and the reason it doesn't get higher stars), let me say something about the movie.<br /><br />It is a bit cartoony, the acting is a bit cheesy but they did a good job of making a preview that doesn't overshadow The Wizard of Oz.  in fact this is a great lead into the Wizard of Oz.  The makeup on Mila Kunis is amazing as well as her really biting into her role.  But as I say, I wouldn't purchase this movie for $31 dollars on blu-ray. I think it deserve multiple family viewings but not at that price. So if you haven't seen it, it is worth renting, ABSOLUTELY..
159448385X|5.0|Great follow up to Kite Runner.....wonderfully written and WELL worth the read....can't wait to get the next in the series
B00797MB0O|3.0|Charlize was great.  Movie itself was OK. It was funny but the plot was a little slow in some parts.
B0084I2PEO|5.0|I bought this copy for my son since he loved Kite Runner so well..  so well written that you won't want to turn the light off at night and quit reading
B009AMAGXK|5.0|The beautiful creatures film is very much enjoyable. Is it a classic? Of course not, it was made from a \\"young adult\\" novel. However, the film/book is one of the best Southern Gothic stories I have read since Faulkner...<br /><br />My guess is those who review it negatively (apart from not being bright) don't enjoy occult movie to begin with...Also I thing they had the wrong expectations for the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone as it is a good movie, but you may not like it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|the more you read the more horrified you become at what the good guys had to do do to help make the world a better place these guys deserve more respect and recognition but like most of the good guys they aren't doing the job for that nor would it help make it easier . Thankyou Chris for sharing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved the !game! It is challenging. But so awesome at the same time. I recommend this game for everyone! It takes a great amount of atentoin. IT'S GREAT!:)
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Absolutely Great. Just what I've been waiting for. The Eagles are an American Band that has span 40 years and you can still turn on the Radio and hear their music been played on a genre of music stations.
1433502410|4.0|This is an excellent resource. I like having the maps and commentary so easily accessible. The commentary is great, but do know that it slants toward Reformed theology. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it's just something to keep in mind. For the most part, there is agreement on the major tenants of Christianity. It is becoming an indispensable Bible for my personal study.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved the characters, the story, the anticipation towards the very end....it was just one of those books where after you finish reading you think...man, that was a good book!
B00008N6N5|2.0|I did not like this movie at all.  There are people in this nation who deserve more attention and respect and to be recognized than Larry Flynt.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I own every Rammstein album and love everyone of them. But this one is my favorite. From start to finish this is amazing.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|Bought this without haveing heard any of the new tracks. Classic Killswitch! Amazing.<br />Buy the Special Edition, the live tracks are the best!
0062197266|4.0|Excellent thriller that chronicles rituals of OCD respectfully and realistically.  Cathy is a very nuanced character (not always entirely likable, as she makes some questionable choices) but always believable.<br /><br />I don't recall if we ever find out what happens to Cathy's next-door neighbour, and the scene where Lee shows up for an interview with Cathy and she's not sure if it's really him seemed a bit implausible, but otherwise the writing is outstanding and the story is a decided page-turner.  I believe this book is the author's debut, and it's a very impressive one at that.
B005OK721G|5.0|Yea! Enjoyed tremendously, always empowering to see the female score and wearing the cape having an &#34;S&#34; on her chest!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A novel well worth reading. A great blend of history and fiction. Strong characters who withstand the horrors of war by way of their own grit.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|If there is any chance you can see this band play......RUNnnnnnnn and purchase a ticket! Purchase two and turn a freind on for life....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not stop reading, just like the first in the series! I can't wait for the next book!<br />Sylvia day is an excellent author
B0054EU0H0|5.0|Fit right, and easy to clean...no more fingerprints all over. Was skeptical about the price, but I was wrong. Awesome!
B0036UW09U|5.0|I love the emotion in this film, along with the music.  Still gets me every time.  Kris K. did a great job acting - his vocals not so much, but very believable.  If you missed this one, worth a watch.  One of my all time favorites.
B00280LYHS|4.0|I thought the book was very good. I just wish that he had brought out all the characters for  a BIG ending.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I love this movie it is now in my top ten. It looks amazing on bluray. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game.  It is a great way to pass the time.  Requires good depth perception, and hard to win, but definitely fun.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The words of my oldest daughter: I loved it. I thought it was hilariously cute and silly. I loved how in the book it had so much about his early childhood in the beginning. The Valentine's Dance goes terribly wrong for Greg.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We love this game.  It was the first game we  downloadad, I think it is a little hard but my daughter is good at it and loves it.My daughter tried extra hard to get coins so she could unlock Scarlet Fox.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Continuing to look forward to each new episode!! The characters are so interesting and the cinematography and costumes are amazing!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book and a great trilogy. This is a great romance and erotic trilogy of Anna and Christian. I highly recommend all three books to anyone who likes romance with some sex involved.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I'll be honest, I love Jurassic Park. And dinosaurs in general, really. So I was excited to play a game where I got to build a really cool park with those dinosaurs in the spotlight. And then...I played this. The gameplay isn't bad, but that, I would say, is it's only redeeming factor. The sound is atrocious, so I have to play with no volume whatsoever. When you have twenty dinosaurs and they all make sounds when you click on them (hence collecting coins from them), it gives you a headache rather quickly. My biggest issue though? The overwhelming amount of money you would have to sink into this game to get everything you could. When certain dinosaurs equal $20 (or more), it's hitting a point of insanity. Do I want a tyrannosaurus? Duh. Do I want to pay X amount of dollars to have that dinosaur in a video game? No. And, though you can collect virtual 'dollars' to spend on those dinosaurs, they are few and far between. Overall, the game is a decent time-waster...if you don't feel like shelling out money to get in-game goodies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am looking forward to season 4 hope it continues in the same fashion. Starting mid January. should be fun!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This is easily the best mobile game I've ever played, despite the confusing title (people just don't understand zeroes, do they?). It's addicting. It's one of the few games I can think of that has the right amount of challenge, and at the same time, retains it's accessibility to newcomers. The upgrade system is one of my favorite features. Though it could be deeper, it does the job exceptionally well, and even better, you can actually see the results. If you do anything exciting this year, let it be spending the money on this. It's worth it.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|As each year passes, the amount of good albums that come out continues to fade. It is a good thing that The National is a band that continues to produce quality alternative music in a time when very little exists. I agree with many of the posts that state \\"it will hook you even more with each listen\\". First listen there are certain tracks that grabbed me \\"Demons\\", \\"Heavenfaced\\", \\"Humiliation\\", and \\"Pink Rabbits\\". Over a couple more listens, the whole album begins to pull you in.<br /><br />I believe this album is somewhat of a continuation of High Violet, yet has its own direction that it leads to. I have been listening to The National since 2005, all of their albums are pretty epic. However, I thought High Violet really took them to a level of timeless. Perhaps this album takes that path....only time will tell.
B0041CGP02|5.0|I'm a huge Bon Jovi fan so as always, their CD's are great....this one was no exception. &#34;Requiring a certain number of words in a review is really going to force people to stop responding to your request&#34; Something to think about!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Awesome season as part of an awesome series!  Packaging for DVDs is good quality, not like some of the garbage holders you see lately.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|Love the new CD.  I had heard the songs from the concert but loved all of them as I always do.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|I usually don't watch the entire movie all in one sitting, but even in segments it brings many a chuckle. Good for a gray day when you need to laugh.
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Great lyrics and music.Love her voice and the whole upbeat feel of the album,This is one of my favorite albums!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The best love story I have ever read!!! A must read for hopeless romantic people like me :)<br /><br />I just can't get over it! You will fall in love with all the characters especially Christian Grey. And believe me, you will have a \\"fifty shades of grey\\" hangover after reading this :) lol<br /><br />I can't wait for the movie!!!
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|I have given it 3 stars because it has awesome features in the game but very very few mission's.Please try GTA 3 instead of it
B008K7WCJM|5.0|This is an epic sprawling work from Swans. Probably difficult for some first time listeners just discovering them. A great follow up to the previous album.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Dudes you should try it no not try it buy it it's free and fun so get it now while you can
B000J4QWMC|5.0|Love Jamie Fox in all his movies.  The movie was full of excitement.  I like this version of Miami Vice better that the old one with Don Johnson.  I would recommend it to all my friends.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The ending was spectacular. It was the best part. It kept me thinking almost like The Hunger Games series did.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I haven't watched any of this series, but my wife and 22 year-old daughter watched the first three seasons on Netflix. I did sit down to watch a scene in which one of the characters sings an acapella rendition of Tom Waits' song, &#34;Hold On.&#34; Anyway, my family loves the show.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is boss... THE boss. It would be better if it had multiplayer though if it had multiplayer this game would be flawless!!!!!!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a great and inspiring historical piece showing the pains that Lincoln and his family went through as the first family during one of the most critical periods in American history. It's gives a really interesting historical view of the U.S. Congress and our ancestors' views on slavery and voting rights for minorities including African Americans and women at the time that Lincoln is trying to pass the 13th amendment to abolish slavery.
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|This book is hysterically funny.  I laughed all the way through it.  I love it!  I am not kidding I laughed my head off and then would re-read a part so I could laugh again.
B0018QPPXW|4.0|It's so good to see the young Tom Cruise again. He hasn't aged much as he's gotten older. I also Deborah DeMornay.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I saw Blake Shelton perform the song &#34;Boys Round Here&#34; on the Country Music Awards.  It was such a fun song; I just had to get the CD.  It took a little while to be delivered, but WOW was it worth waiting for.  I thought that one song would be the only one  I would  lenjoy. I loved all of them.  This is totally new concept in country music. The descriptions of living in the &#34;country&#34; are perfect. I grew up in a small town in the south, and it  was right on. There are sweet love songs too.  I listen to it over and over and love it.  If you like country music, you will LOVE THIS.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|Tom Hardy, Gerard Butler, Idris Elba, Mark Strong, Thandie Newton are great. The city boss, Tom Wilkinson is controlling all the criminal groups in London. There's a twist at the end.
0060531053|5.0|I like this book so much I bought the paperback twice and the kindle edition once. This is a must have for anyone brewing. EricShirk.com
B0079HLDCQ|4.0|Baldacci has weaved a tale of intrigue with complex characters whose interaction keeps the reader enthralled. Highly recommended reading. It will keep you up all night.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Storyline was awful; acting was subpar and expected; the cinematography and direction was ok; in the end I expected more.
B00B4666O8|3.0|Not a very sharp DVD copy,  I was under the impression/thought that it was a Region 1 DVD-probably my error
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I'm not a computer geek at all, but bought this on a friends recommendation. I couldn't put it down and now I'm buying it for my son. It helps that I love the 80's!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Watched this first episode and plan an finishing the series. Nice Downton vibe. But later in the century. Going to be interesting
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|Game is a little fun but not recommended for young children. It is a little hard to comprehend. The graphics are really nice though.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I went and saw this in theaters and it was so good.Was a breath of fresh air from the vampire/werewolf stuff that had been going around.Totally loved ''R'' and was rooting for them the whole time.Totally worth the money and time if you are a big Twilight movie fan or if you are looking for a movie that makes you feel good at the end.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, John le Carre's third novel, was a huge success at the time it was written.  A recent article about le Carre in The New York Times prompted me to read this novel for the first time.  Set in the 1960's, when Eastern Block and Western Block nations stockpiled weapons of &#34;mutually assured destruction,&#34;  spying garnered international interest.  This novel captures the intrigue and danger of that clandestine profession, and the &#34;cold&#34; personae it requires.  Rumor is that JFK preferred Ian Fleming.  But John le Carre is the better writer.  His plots are deeper and his characters more complex.  Characters in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold appear in future le Carre novels; this novel is an excellent opportunity to meet them.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Decent movie but not quite as great as I expected from a \\"Die Hard\\" movie.  It was missing something. And what happened to the yippee cayayee?
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am a big fan of Tony stark. Really  like the graphics. My grandson plays for hours at a Time. 5 stars for sure.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Our first Amazon video rental was a great experience. Of course, we knew mary poppins, but it was really fun to get it up and playing almost faster than loading in a DVD!
B000005AYL|2.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. I was pretty upset when I received my package and found inside an all black LP sleeve with a sticker on it saying baduizm instead of the actual album art shown. It was only 8 bucks on sale so It i'snt worth the hassle of returning it and hoping that I get what was advertised.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is so cool the best free game I have ever plaster but supper addicting! I couldn't have asked for more!
B00CWV8X04|4.0|I rented this movie because I like Rooney Mara. It was better than I thought it would be with a great twist at the end.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Maybe it's just me but I'm so disappointed with the way book series are ending nowadays.<br />A quick, rushed end of a series that was awesome in the beginning.<br />Not a fan.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps! It is fun but hard and REALLY fun when your vehicle is upgraded a lot. I would recommend this app to people who are looking to have fun but have a challenge at the same time.<br /><br />&infin;Bridget Amelia
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series reminds me of a British version of Little House on the Prairie.  I really enjoy the portrayal of the class system and how hard it was to break out of the structure.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|To all the people complaining about the porn ads, there are plenty of adblock apps. I recommend Adaway. It removes the ads at the bottom and you can enjoy nice, crisp 1080p downloaded YouTube videos without porn ads. The app is great. The fact I can access the website version of YouTube on my kindle instead of the downgraded phone app is nice on my kindle. I do however encounter a bug where after a random amount of time using the app, I get a message that says \\"can't play video.\\" A fix would be greatly appreciated.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|a bit on the darker side, but great plot and story.  Can't wait for #2 to come out in Nov.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|This is a neat little present that I bought for my 2 year old nephew to keep his legos and duplos in. It is exactly as advertised, I guess I was just surprised at how small it was. I wouldn't have purchased it for this price if I had taken the time to look at the size of it in the description.
B0061QD82E|4.0|A Disney classic! Watching this makes me feel like a kid again. \\"Isn't she just a sweet little lady?\\" also the dvd arrived way sooner than expected! Thanks!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|My wife loves the whole Harry Potter series and the beautiful Blu Ray copies in this collection are very much better than the standard DVDs they replace.  The sound is even better in the last few movies.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Riveting and moving this is a wonderful series making you want to watch one episode after another!  Don't miss it.
B0019UGYK0|5.0|&#34;What we have here is a failure to communicate&#34;!!  This is my favorite line from the is excellent movie.  My collection is better for having it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the better books I have read lately and an interesting close to the series of books. Great fun
B00138KKMQ|5.0|This is my favorite album by Billy Joel. It has all his early hits. My favorites are &#34;Allentown&#34; and &#34;Leningrad&#34;.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|My wife and I have seen the stage productions twice in London and once in NY..The music in the movie was better than the original stage production in London..If you didn't get a chance of seeing it in theatres you should buy it!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|I have always loved this movie. The folk tales of William Wallace come alive on the screen. How many of us would die because we believed something so strongly?
B003NS2T9G|3.0|The story line is interesting. I did enjoy the series but I began to dislike Jack, the leader. He is too arrogant. This series is also very sexually liberated. I would not want my kids to watch this. There are sexual references between everyone on the show. Not just male/female but female/female and male/male too. Too much male on male kissing for my taste. There was one female on female kiss, but about 5 male on male full on make-out  sessions. I really didn't need to see that. The \\"f\\" word is also frequently used. This show is not for kids.
B00013M6NK|1.0|This is the worst battery replacement I have bought before, after a few use the battery the battery work no more...
B0064UPU4G|4.0|Great album. Signature sound has never been better made by other artists. I would strongly advise others to purchase this album if they like any other music performed by Daft Punk.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Took one look at it and deleted it. More for the comic lover than the movie fan. Not for me.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The reason I got this book is because, well I personally help out kids who have \\" special needs \\" and I truthfully love them with all my heart. So this book really touched my heart and I would give it 1,000,000 stars if I could!!
B007FTZDN8|3.0|Got this because it was free and for some reason thought it had to do with music but it is a current events type app and I simply was not interested. It aslo seemed to have too much information, hard to navigate. If you like the news and celebrity gossip you will like this but it just as not for me.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I never review anything but this book was so bad i was angry.  When I picked up book one I fell in love  Sookie Stackhouse and the the world of Southern Vampire Mysteries.  I agree with other reviewers that the quality of the novels began to decline around book 10 and this one was by far the worst.  There was really no story at all, just a procession of minor characters coming to visit.  While I respect the authors right to choose how her story ends the lack of any mystery or story at all in the final book was an insult to her readers.  The Sookie Stackhouse that emerged over the last few books was lifeless and dull.  Where was the girl that had a little fight in her?  She spent all of this time exploring the world around her to simply end up shoving her head in the sand and pretending to be normal.  Her happy ending was simply to live a normal life and pretend to be normal. The ending  left a such bad taste in my mouth I can't even bring myself to read the first 8 books again.  I repeat, the final installment of the SSTB series was a major disapointment.  It's the first time I've ever returned anything but after that read, I wanted my money back!!!
B000FA675C|5.0|I bought this for my Kindle because it was free, probably so we would read it and it would whet our Dan Brown appetite for his new book.<br />Therefore I have to review it from what I remember having read it years ago.<br />By now everyone knows the story, but the importance of this book is that it got people taking about religion, Catholicism, heresy, history, so many topics, and so many different personalities and beliefs in the conversation. No one really knows all of what is fact or fiction int hsi book but it made people think, made them talk, and it was a hell of a good thriller.<br />His best? No. I think Angels and Demons was a better book, but nothing will come close for a long time to the impact this novel had on society in America.
0679805273|5.0|Oh, The Places You'll Go was the theme for our son's school Book Week. Each child had to make a poster of his favorite book, character etc along with a picture of them reading it. Great idea.<br /><br />It is one of the best children's books ever written. It has a positive message about life.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story got better as the book went along.  It's a little hard to read with the Irish dialect, but overall was a good read.  The stories in the orphanage were very good, yet highly disturbing to think that's what some people actually experienced.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|A great and captivating story. Truly this novel does an extraordinary job of revisiting \\"the flare\\" and explaining what occurred before the maze runner series
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It's, not necessarily a great read, but it was an easy, enjoyable read.  Great book to take on a vacation.
B000I62JAK|5.0|Not for the faint of heart, but great send-ups of popular culture, fashion, and cameos by David Bowie and others.  Lots of fun!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Giallian Flynn has amazing story telling skills. A womanist of a different kind!  I could not put down this book.
B009NY43NY|5.0|While the book seemed too short to me (a good sign, tho!) I really loved the ending. Will miss learning more about the characters, but agree that it was time to bring it to a close.  Look forward to her next series!

It isn't just a personal favourite either. It's one of Walt Disney's most beloved animated classics, one of the studio's greatest treasures and arguably the best Disney animated feature released in the 1950s. It has survived controversy, especially Tiger Lily and the Indians are still considered racially offensive in various circles and weathered criticism about the liberties Uncle Walt and his screenwriters took with J.M. Barrie's 1904 play and 1911 children's novel. And yet no censorship has been perpetrated and very little criticism has prevailed. It's a high-flying, swashbuckling adventure in the true spirit of the original and, in many ways, was the first production, on stage or off, to lend a thrillingly palpable sense of magic, grandeur and storybook fantasy to Barrie's text. Even today, some sixty years after its theatrical release, Peter Pan remains a magnificent animated film, as truly timeless as any Disney classic that came before it or come since.<br /><br />‘PETER PAN’ harks back to a wondrous age in animation, before the advent of CGI and the misguided belief that traditional, hand drawn animation was outmoded. Pardon the nostalgic digression, but Walt Disney's fourteenth animated feature, now celebrating its 60th anniversary, has the look and whimsy of a much younger production. With no computers to rely on, Pan's legendary team of animators, especially the Nine Old Men who crafted something extraordinary for its time and something that continues to withstand the test of time. The beautifully expressive characters do nothing less than spring to life, while each acrobatic bout of flying, singing, dancing and swordplay is framed by gorgeous hand-painted backgrounds. Even now, with Disney aggressively resurrecting the hand-drawn feature, classics like Peter Pan stand tall, created entirely with pencils, ink, brushes and paint, and all the passion and spirit that goes into such hands-on artistry. Many of the CGI animators of the modern age are master animators in their own right, don't misunderstand. But there's something utterly magical about Walt Disney's early animated classics, and it's a magic that continues to grab hold of viewers, young and old, nostalgic and newcomer alike. Simply put: ‘PETER PAN’ is one of the Disney greats, and that isn't about to change anytime soon. &#34;All this has happened before, and all this will happen again...&#34;<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – The debate rages on, although fuelled by less disappointment than ‘Cinderella’ generated. ‘PETER PAN’ flies onto Blu-ray with a vibrant; striking 1080p encoded video transfer, restored with all the renewed digital advances available to the Disney restoration team. The results will delight most and mildly irritate a few; the few being those who feel the complete absence of grain and the slight (stress on slight) alterations made to the film's original colour and contrast are contrary to Walt Disney and his animators' intentions and the film's original presentation. The debate asks should a classic film be subjected to such changes. Should Disney attempt to create a transfer that's truer to the original cell art or to the 1953 theatrical image? Ideally, a release like Peter Pan would present both a classic restoration and a spectacularly clean revitalisation, but the choice has been made. The latter over the former it is. Still, purists would do well to embrace everything Disney has accomplished, if only in part. Marvellous leaps and strides have been made here, and not all of them controversial. In fact, only the grain removal, which appears to have taken little to no toll on the image other than its intended use, gave me pause, as it alters the texture of the original film, but despite this, I think the final result is absolutely stunning and looks better than when I viewed it in the cinema.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – Absolutely outstanding 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track crows at the top of its lungs and unleashes its sonic attack with notable precision. At the same time, the 7.1 presentation rarely, if ever, flies in the face of the film's original sound design. Though the rear speakers wrap the sounds of Never Land around the listener, it doesn't feel like a betrayal and is always executed with the utmost respect for the audio elements. Directional effects are light but playful, ambience is subtle but effective and a few acoustic flourishes make caves and other locales more immersive. Output is restrained as well but no less welcome, lending weight and presence to every low-end assault and exchange. Voices and sound effects, meanwhile, are completely unhindered and perfectly prioritised. A few lines of dialogue show their age, as anyone should expect from a sixty-year old feature, but remain clear and intelligible regardless. Add to that the full, enveloping presence of the film's score and songs and you have a first-rate 7.1 remix for this classic animation film.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: Introduction by Diane Disney-Miller [1080p] Diane Disney-Miller provides a quick introduction to the film, touching on her father's attraction to adapting J.M. Barrie's tale and the artwork created during the film's development.<br /><br />Special Feature: DisneyView [With Side Bars] [1080p] [1.77:1]You have black bars either side of the image to fill the Widescreen Image area of your Television. The Walt Disney background artwork is by painter Cristy Maltese who did ‘The Little Mermaid,’ ‘Beauty and the Beast’ and ‘Aladdin.’<br /><br />Special Feature: Peter Pan Sing-Along [1080p] Here you have an optional Sing-Along track, which is so easily engaged or can be skipped when selecting the &#34;Play&#34; option in the main menu. It's a simple subtitle feature. Sadly there is no karaoke-style guide marker or highlighting.<br /><br />Special Feature: Growing Up with Nine Old Men [1080p] [45:00] This nice bonus feature short, features Ted Thomas speaking with the other grown-up sons and daughters of Walt Disney’s Nine Old Men. We found this bonus feature very charming, and it was interesting to glimpse into the world of the Nine Old Men from a different point of view. Ted Thomas is an amiable and folksy interviewer, and clearly has a kinship with those who went through a similar childhood as he did. The name started as a joke and a term of playful endearment by Walt Disney he gave to his 9 leading animators. But it soon became a badge of honour for the most legendary and influential animators in Disney history. Hear about the Nine Old Men from those who were closest to them and their children, now upwards in years themselves and learn about the artists' contributions and work, both personal and professional.<br /><br />Deleted Songs and Scenes [1080p] [15:00] Unearthed from the Disney Vault, two deleted scenes and two deleted songs, presented via original storyboards, concept art, rough cell elements and key frames: &#34;The Journey Home,&#34; &#34;Alternate Arrival,&#34; &#34;Never Smile at a Crocodile&#34; and &#34;The Boatswain Song.&#34;<br /><br />Classic DVD Bonus Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: Backstage Disney [480i] [65:00] Five behind-the-scenes feature and documentaries include &#34;You Can Fly: The Making of Peter Pan,&#34; &#34;In Walt's Words: Why I Made Peter Pan,&#34; &#34;Tinker Bell: A Fairy's Tale,&#34; &#34;The Peter Pan that Almost Was&#34; and &#34;The Peter Pan Story.&#34;<br /><br />Special Feature: Music & More [1080p and 480i] [17:00] Disney Song Selection and presented in 1080p with 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Deleted Song: The Pirate Song. Never Land: The Lost Song. Music Video: Never Land, performed by Paige O'Hara and Music Video: The Second Star to the Right, performed by T-Squad.<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Commentary with Roy Disney: Roy Disney hosts this extensive audio commentary, taken from the film's previous DVD release. Disney dryly reads from pre-prepared notes, but the interview excerpts and commentary bits featured over the course of the commentary allow the film's animators, voice actors and filmmakers to offer their insight as well. Smartly compiled and edited, the track touches on every aspect of Peter Pan, without wasting a single second.<br /><br />Special Feature: Disney Intermission [1080p] Pausing at any point during the film allows younger viewers to tackle &#34;Pirate Training,&#34; a series of tips, mini-activities and video clips helmed by the first mate of the Jolly Roger.<br /><br />Finally, ‘PETER PAN’ is a classic today as it was twenty, forty or sixty years ago. It remains the wondrous adventure and magnificently animated spectacle it's always been. With Disney's Blu-ray release, it's even more wondrous and magnificent. Backed by a stunning video presentation, and a really strong 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround track, and well over four hours of special features, this New Diamond Edition Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook release of ‘PETER PAN’ is a must-have for any Disney fan or animation aficionado. Don't hesitate: make the leap. Of course what makes my review extra special is the fact that people who have reviewedthe other Blu-ray versions are missing something really special with this extra special Deluxe Limited Edition DigiBook, as it has 18 stunning glossy colour pages of awesome illustration images from the animation, plus the printed words telling you the story of Peter Pan, which could be read to small children at bedtime and make them keen to see this stunning Blu-ray. Ever since I first viewed the animation film ‘PETER PAN’ at the cinema, it has always been a very personal favourite of mine and I can also say it's one of Walt Disney's most beloved animated classics that I never get tired of viewing.

B000A59PMO|5.0|I'd heard of this series before but never watched it before, then when the Kickstarter campaign began I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I understand now. I love mysteries and this show had it all in spades. Veronica was in equal parts heartbreaking and funny as heck. I  only wish I'd contributed to the Kickstarter so I could get the movie before it comes out.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, my son loves this game. I have it on my samsung galaxy s3 motorola, xboard, 7\\" kindle fire hd and droid bionic.<br /><br />it works very well on all my devices.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I watch this with my kids and wife and we all love it and are addicted.  We've been watching a couples of episode a night to catch up and each episode is great.  The storyline is great, and most of the characters are ones you can get invested into different extents.  I think you would know if you'll like the series by the end of the 2nd episode, however we all knew after the 1st that we loved it.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The format of the book, going from the diary of one character to the other was at first very interesting but as the book went on, I got tired of the style of writing and just wanted the book to end so I could find out the ending.<br /><br />The character development was not outstanding.  The characters really didn't change much over the course of the novel.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed in the book, yet I stayed with it to find out the ending.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I've listened to this album start to finish a few times now. I was expecting something similar to 2009's Black Gives Way to Blue (which itself was most reminiscent of the band's 1996 self titled release,aka Tripod,their final album with Staley),and while it certainly turned out to be the case,there were some surprises,chiefly that this album sounds somewhat brighter and more \\"shimmery\\" than it's predecessors. More hopeful,almost.<br /><br />Which is not to say that the usual trademark AiC sound has changed. The dark,haunting vocal melodies and two part harmonies and heavy,churning,odd meter,gloom and doom riffs and grooves are still present in abundance (Hollow,Pretty Done,Stone,Lab Monkey,Phantom Limb) and I noticed the swirly,dreamy,delirious sound of the Facelift/Dirt era returns in the title track and on \\"Hung on a Hook\\". Also returning are the jarring,sudden tempo changes that lend the songs a sense of urgency and drama. But in contrast,\\"Voices\\" and \\"Scalpel\\" are soaring,up tempo,catchy,melodic pieces.\\"Low Ceiling\\",and \\"Breath on a Window\\" follow in similar suit. These are the most upbeat AiC songs since \\"No Excuses\\" from 1995's Jar of Flies. This back and forth change of pace as the album progresses gives it a certain vast,varied,expansive feel (I think Roger Waters calls it \\"light and shade\\") not heard since Jar of Flies,and that I think Black Gives Way to Blue lacked in comparison,as great as it is.<br /><br />I also noticed this album didn't seem to be as compressed as BGWTB,the quality of which suffered somewhat due to excessive compression during mixing (just like Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\".)<br /><br />As I listened to the dual harmonies,it's again proven that Jerry Cantrell,Sean Kinney and Mike Inez made an excellent choice in hiring William Duvall as their new vocalist years ago,which brings me to what is my only real gripe with The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here; Cantrell takes lead vocals on the vast majority of the record,considerably more than on BlackGives Way to Blue,while Duvall usually comes in on the chorus to provide backup. The three songs in which Duvall is feautured most are \\"Hollow\\",\\"Hung on a Hook\\" and \\"Phantom Limb\\",and his interesting,eerie tone and inflection make his absence elsewhere even more noticeable. Jerry is a great singer in his own right,with a distinct,intantly recognizable voice and style,and he is essentially the \\"leader\\" of AiC,but part of what made BGWTB so great was Duvall's greater prominence,especially on songs like \\"A Looking in View\\" and \\"Acid Bubble\\",which are my two favorite songs on that record due in no small part to his great voice and talent. Duvall has a lot to contribute and I hope he has more opportunity to shine on future AIC records.<br /><br />All in all,another great album from Alice in Chains.<br /><br />My favorites:<br /><br />Hollow<br />Pretty Done<br />Stone<br />Lab Monkey<br />Breath on a Window (possibly my favorite)<br />Low Ceiling<br />Phantom Limb

B0094K20FK|3.0|I respect this movie for its place in science fiction moviedom. Having said that, it has its weaknesses as a film. Great to see it again as background to the new film ... And to compare then and now for acting and FX.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this type game.  Now I can play anytime I want to on my Kindle. Haven't mastered it yet, but it is great fun trying!

B002QH2NUA|5.0|I was at both concerts, Citi Field and Yankee stadium. Disappointed that this concert did not get released as a Blu-Ray..:-( Outstanding concert, 2 1/2 hours of non stop songs sung in the original key. A must buy for any Beatles fan..
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This title is a real gem amongst the Kindle Apps which sadly does lack in the quality of other OSes.  Easy to understand and attractive to the eyes.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I don't want to spend money to play. this game gives me a chance to play and not have to pay. there are chances to win gems and money. I'm able to breed rare dragons by trial and error and don't have to spend 250 gems I don't have. addictive and super fun
B00C061I3K|2.0|This is pleasant enough, but not remotely as exciting as MFSB or any of the Philly Sound; Beautiful Bend; early Donna Summer; The Undisputed Truth; El Coco; Desmond Child and Rouge; and a dozen or two dozen other classic groove groups from the disco era.  It's disco lite and unexciting.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|a good cute movie me and the kids really liked it we all got good belly laughs, the streaming was good on just 6meg dsl
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loaded this app twice and cannot get it to work.  When you try to launch it, I see the Kindle circle icon for a few seconds, then it goes away and the device goes back to the home page.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app is outstanding it does what it says is right on the numbers I will be using this app a lot.I highly recommend that people should use this app and I give it a5 star rating
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is great! Its gameplay is amazing. Edward page is the notorious villain who hates America and wants revenge. Your Corporal Blake, and sometimes you even play as the villain. Multiplayer is great, buying guns and grenades. The game is pretty easy, which is one of the cons. Otherwise, the game is great for people. If you don't like Gore, there is even an option part. I got the game while it was on sale for $99&cent;! It felt like I stole the game. 10 missions, all pretty easy. Get the game, it's quite amazing!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this is an Excellent game, i really love it, its such good fun.<br />This game has my full attention right now
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I don't know where I was when this movie was first released, but I regret that I missed it. I didn't know what to expect from it. It started like a drama and then turned into an exciting adventure. I liked the movie, actors and special effects. I am not sure if I've seen the original movie, so I can't compare both movies. I don't know why it has only 3 stars. It's an interesting, very well-done movie. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in science fiction!
B00BF11STU|4.0|A chilling look at what goes on behind closed wars.  Would recommend this as a classroom study for people in the media, surely - but also for mental health clinicians.
B00A4SJ61W|4.0|I like to be entertained. This movie is entertaining. Beyond that it keeps my 3 godchildren very happy. That is a win in my book. Plus, I like it when Brad Pitt gets to be goofy in his roles, animated or not.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Complex, satisfying, beautifully written. Environmentalism, the Silicone Valley economic disaster, the Fukishima disaster and the fallout from both are woven together with fully realized characters, both major and minor.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Keeps me sane as well as my passwords protected. Worth every penny to have on my mobile devices as well as my computers.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This season brought the show back to what made me love it in the first place. Good story line and the bond between Dean and Sam was tested yet again and emerged tighter than ever. It also showed that Dean's greatest fear of not being able to keep Sam safe is true, so which brother is the choosen one?
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book has a some unexpected twists that makes the it even more addicting.  It's a great an easy read.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I love books that are written in this genre, Jr. Fiction. They are easy reading and don't go into too much depth that you get lost, but just enough that the characters come alive for the reader. This book did just that for me. The setting is described well and the story line never gets boring.<br /><br />Zoey Redbird is serious enough at her age to be much older than her years. She can take on anything her Goddess puts on her and she does it with ease. She picks up some loyal friends at her new school, though in this first installment of the series she also does a couple of things that may cause problems down the road.<br /><br />She has two potential love interests, even if she does protest that one of them is not her boyfriend anymore. He doesn't think so. She has a terrible enemy that never quits, even when it seems she's lost a small battle. This book has it all. Drama, intrique, magic, love, and even a little teensy bit of sexual stuff.<br /><br />I really liked the book and highly recommend it for people over 13.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Books carrys on from the first one, just as good and easy to read. Keeps you interested in the storyline and wanting to know what happens next.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Not bad, not great. Worth the money to see. Thought provoking and musing. Get it if you're looking for something outside the Hollywood &#34;same old&#34; factory.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Good story lines, well written book that just makes you want to keep reading. Couldn't put it down! Don't bother with 50shades, this is better read material.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is terribly addictive! I had heard about if from some friends and gave them the &#34;whateve&#34; eye roll. Then I watched the first episode. Great! I've been strung out like a junky ever since. I can't wait for the next episode.
B000JLSM00|1.0|I bought this movie after reading a book about the making of the movie and the true story behind it. I was a child of the '50s. I always felt the John Wayne/John Ford movies were corny; but watching this one at the age of 59, I just couldn't believe we grew up on this stuff! And, by today's standards, it's hard to believe that the American audience at the time would believe that the setting (Monument Valley) was supposed to be Texas! Yee haw.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I love this Archer series of books--I find the the characters interesting and surprising.  The ending of this one leaves you hanging and begging for the next one.  I just wish the author would write faster!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app! The full screen feature the look and feel of the calculator. This is the best I have seen.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|Shame on you if you do not have this book. Be sure to get it in printed form also. Now!
B007IK44CK|3.0|Look, this is a good action movie.  I have no complaints about that.  But, I just did not give two hoots about how it ended.  I mean, we know how it ends--the good guys win--so these movies are only good if you want to see how the good guys win.  This movie lost my interest in that regard because it wasn't suspenseful or clever.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Cute game. Kinda reminds me of the old battle games I played as a kid. With having to make &quot;barracks&quot; and supply houses and such.
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|I do not understand the scathing reviews. Were they written by Twilight fans?  This book provided an ending that, for me, felt inevitable and reasonably happy. This series isn't high art - this is a series of supernatural romance novels, each written to be consumed in a night's reading.<br /><br />SPOILERS SWEETIE >>>><br /><br />Loose threads were tied up, enemies lurking in the past were flushed out and taken care of, friendships re-established and mended, past lovers seem settled and at peace, Eric made the choice he was always going to make based on who he is and Sookie gets a relationship with a future with someone whose mind she can't read.<br /><br />It could be an age thing that made some reviewers unhappy. The dangerous, passionate lover who is tamed by true love is a standby of romance novels. However in most romance novels these guys are young and get mellower with age. Eric is a deadly Peter Pan who is selfish, violent and has abused Sookie when he is angry with her (the feeding he didn't bother to deaden the pain of when he was angry with her killed any sympathy I had for him).<br /><br />Personally I'm glad she ended up with a relationship with a warm,sweet man who won't treat her as a possession and food source and that, if all goes well, will result in a marriage with the children Sookie wants.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|I love watching The Big Bang Theory because it always brings a smile to my face and makes my day!
B008602KQI|4.0|I know I'm not the only one who saw that the number of arrows Katniss had left wasn't consistent with how many she shot because I googled \\"hunger games arrows inconsistencies\\" and found that not only were there mistakes in that area of the movie, but also several others. This is not too bad for an otherwise very entertaining movie, but having been conditioned to count the number of bullets used in older movies the number of arrows left being incorrect was all too obvious, particularly when the number of arrows were obviously limited when Katniss acquired the bow.
B001E75QH0|5.0|Best adventure movies ever.  Great quality all in one package.  The additional features on the discs are nice as well.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|To be clear, I have been an avid Star Trek fan for several decades, and while I don't comb movies for inconsistencies with an encyclopedia of starship schematics in one hand and a Klingon dictionary in the other, I am well-versed in the cannon and have followed the series in all its iterations.<br /><br />That said, this was an enjoyable film, a lot of fun, and well-worth the money to see in theaters. It's accessible to those who are not steeped in the Star Trek universe and gives many nods to those of us who are.  J.J. Abrams and his team have done their homework and it shows.  They've created a worthy addition to the Star Trek legacy, have followed the rules where they needed to, and expanded on characters and plot lines where it is plausible.  (I'm thinking here of Khan and not of the Spock/Uhura thing.)  I can not comment on every nuance of the choices they've made, or if there's an obscure reference that they've misplaced (I'm sure there are some) but to those that nit-pick and insist on finding fault with details of the film, I can only quote a particular Saturday Night Live skit, from a certain starship captain: \\"Get a life.\\"  We in the old guard need to realize that things are changing, that the torch is being past, and that to continue as a viable, living entity, we need to grow and adapt.  This film, does that well, and has learned from the mistakes of the last.  (Though I would hasten to add that that too was a marked success.)<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />My only concern is the appearance of a particular member of the old cast.  I enjoyed seeing them and would very much like to see them again in the same role, but don't like implication of their use as a foil in this film.  What's the standard operating procedure - make a phone call, get advice and proceed?  There has to be a point where these kids stand on their own.<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Inall, highly successful, highly enjoyable, and very much recommended.  I wound up going home and watching Star Trek II to remind myself of some of the nuances.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a great fun family game for all ages pluses its super fun. I think its the greatest game ever made!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great for people of all ages. i could play for hours. this app was great friendly compeyitio  amongst my family.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Love this movie for the explanation of global warming & how our world can change.  I love the special effects.  It is great way to open a dialogue with students.  Seeing the bigger picture!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book opens up your eyes to who really invented the modern world. Tesla was a modern day genius that did not get the credit he deserved.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Love this movie. Special effects were great.  It is a best way to rethink what you think you know!! Excellent entertainment.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Whether you agree or not with Sheryl, her account of her struggles and success is an honest account of her professional path. Any executive, especially a woman discussing gender issues, that tells their personal truth has to be respected.
B003LPNGWA|5.0|I really like movies with a story and that don't add unnecessary sex or violence to a good thing.  I will continue purchase this kind of film.
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I have a radio adapter for my iPod which does not work with my iPod Shuffle, so this adapter was necessary. It works fine, but the cord is really long (i have it rubber banded up) and it does not charge the iPod Shuffle like the primary unit charges my iPod Nano. I have to unplug my Shuffle when not using as it also does not stop playing when the car is turned off. Neither is a big deal, but worth mentioning.
0887431453|5.0|We purchased this for our 4 year old daughter who has already completed one year of preschool and will be in it again next year. We want to work with her this summer on some things so she can retain as much information as possible. This workbook looks great so far! It is VERY colorful and right away our daughter has been wanting to sit down and do some pages all by herself! Would definitely recommend!
B005HSL626|1.0|so not cool for me. It is a waste of time to download and is so hard to pass the levels!!!!!!!!! :( &lt;{3
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I had not seen this in at least 25 years, but it is still entertaining, well-acted, and (even, unbelievably) relevant.  If you have never seen this film, it is well worth your time -- a LOT of time, as it is probably the longest film I've ever seen.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I had seen an episode or two of suits randomly on TV before and had enjoyed the individual episodes.  Never really knew the context of the show before I found it on Prime though.<br /><br />The good stuff:<br />-The main characters are well developed and fun to follow<br />-Each episode easily works as a stand alone<br />-Watching the overall season brings additional story to the table (reminds of a show like NCIS)<br />-There are a couple of characters that you just love to hate and you want to see them fail (I always enjoy these)<br />-Though the show mostly focuses on solving cases there's a few underlying love stories going on to spice things up<br />-Watching it on Prime is awesome cause there's no commercials, wohoo<br /><br />The bad stuff:<br />-Per usual they end the season with a cliff hanger<br />-In general the show is quite predictable
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I like this book, i want to see the movie. It would seem like a good movie after reading this.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|It was ok-I actually thought it was a different movie so was caught off guard. Tom C. did pretty good-I like his character..the action...and his knowledge of militia style tactics.<br />Pretty cool.
B009CF3MEK|5.0|This version was great. Looking forward to seeing the latest version for comparison. This one will be hard to beat/
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I DOVE My Hores they even have unicorns  and zebras.  I LOVE  this app you should get this app. Best app ever.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I have spent the whole night reading this and now have to go to wok. I enjoyed the interaction between Don and Rosie. The awareness of Don and his limited social awareness, the growing relationship between them. A polished book, very well written and a delight to read.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The movie was scary, but because I know this has really happened it made it very intense.  The reality of what people suffer when one of these hits comes to life with this movie.  I thought the children did an amazing job of acting in this film.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The acting is great and the story line sucked me in.  The tension amongst the characters is well balanced.I finished season 1 in 3 days, and I don't even feel bad about the chores that didn't get done.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Nicholas Sparks who wouldn't love it.  The movie was as good as the book and I was so happy this beautiful lady found happiness.  So many women today don't have the courage to walk away and this movies shows that there is life and love after a bad man.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|(Anker sent me this one for review, the one I received was the \\"18W 3.6A Car Charger + Micro USB Cord\\" model.)<br /><br />Charger works as advertised, was able to charge both my Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 simultaneously and both showed \\"Charging (AC)\\" so amperage was as advertised.  Charger feels solid without any rattles or cheapness, fit in the charging port was tight.  I would prefer it come in black (prefer for my chargers to blend), but that's a minor consideration and not worth any stars off.  Excellent value for the money.
B00B7G3NFU|1.0|The movie was stupid and boring. It drug out so long I almost fell asleep.  It was a depressing film and some parts of it didn't seem realistic.  I was hesitant to watch in the first place and should have followed my instinct.  Did not like the movie....BAD.
B0013BCWEW|5.0|I didn't grow up during the Zodiac killings. In fact it took this movie to bring the events to my attention. The story is all about unexpected heroes and villains, from the cartoonist cum-investigator to the pair of amateur code-breakers who cracked the initial code from the killer.<br /><br />The tragedy of the tale is the all consuming obsession with solving the mystery, at the cost of friends, family and jobs. People like the main character of the story are driven to know the truth where others have given up, and their relentless pursuit of that information both vindicates and or destroys them....usually the latter.<br /><br />Without people like the main character we would never know what had happened.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|So funny!! reminds me of my mother.I would watch again and again.. In fact I did. I love you Barbara!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It provides new angry bird scene, I was getting tired of the original because they had been done to death.  Like the blue bird....
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I think the book was put together in a very systematic way that was easy to follow and left he reader to consider things if a zombie invasion were to actually occur.  All in all a fun read with realism attached to the story.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Books are generally more detailed than movies.  I suppose movies would be at least twice as long if all the explaination and attention to detail in special effects was made.  It was good for what it was.
B009NY43NY|1.0|This book reads like someone else wrote it and was ordered to tie up loose ends. I kept waiting for the book to get good it never did. What a disappointment, wish I didn't preorder
B004EPYZUI|4.0|The movie has hot women, a rather twisted dreamscape plot, and a odd twist in the end that isn't expected.  If i explain the end, it ruins the movie.  Basically there's nothing like hot  psychiatrically committed women dreaming about escape. ok, that's a little sexist, but I'd have to think this is more of a guys movie... but yes women can like it too... either that or hate it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It was so unique, clever, and hilarious.<br /><br />Drew was extraordinary witty, sexy hot, and so funny. The love story was sweet and beautiful. This is a must read. So different then your average romance. It was a great change to hear the male point of view and so honest. A bit crude at times, but in such a real manly, funny way. I couldn't put it down.
B0030T0VFC|4.0|These are really cute little figurines. I bought them for the decoration of my Native American themed Bedroom but I wish I would have waited because now I see these in my Wal-Mart for a considerably cheaper price.
B001IF277K|5.0|My old one was over 2 years old and it would lose the power prettymuch the same day. I got this one and looked exactly the same as my oem from Sony Ericsson. This one lasts way better about 3 days b4 I have to charge it again.  No complaints so far
B0015XWUCC|5.0|Fantastic album from start to finish, the only song I could live without is \\"Try some buy some\\", the only song I actually skip. One of his best albums for me. It's fresh, very enjoyable, with lot of content. Love it!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|The Luck of the Weissensteiners is a powerful and satisfying historical novel, its many characters trapped at the center of Europe in the years before, during and after the worst conflagration the world has ever seen. Those early conversations between the lovers Greta, a beautiful Jewish girl, and Wilhelm, a handsome German boy, are full of charm and innocence. And yet for anyone with the slightest knowledge of history they are tinged with foreboding. As the stories of Greta and Wilhelm and their respective families unfold, Christoph Fischer demonstrates a deep and intimate knowledge of the history, culture and social currents of the region and the time, along with a remarkable understanding of Jewish life, especially surprising since the author is not Jewish. This is a writer who has done the research, assimilated the plethora of facts, and managed the comprehension of a remarkably diverse collection of people to make a great swath of history and human drama his own. In the process he proves he is deeply in touch with the vagaries of the human soul. A compelling story and an impressive debut. Highly recommended.
B00000E7Q6|4.0|As with all his albums, I slowly learned to appreciate this, which is widely underrated in my opinion. Elegant, saxy (yes with an \\"a\\"), funky...different from all his other albums, this has its personality. But the order of the songs is completely wrong, and the Morrissey cover is simply awful and unuseful.This is how my Black Tie White Noise is:<br /><br />1. The wedding<br />2. Black tie white noise<br />3. Jump they say<br />4. Nite flights<br />5. Miracle goodnight<br />6. Don't let me down and down<br />7. Pallas Athena<br />8. You've been around<br />9. I feel free<br />10. The wedding song
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate this game! It is very stupid! I can't even download it because it wasn't upgrading so my brother deleted it and now it says &quot;Open&quot; instead of &quot;Download&quot; butt when I click it it doesn't &quot;Open&quot;!
B00001OH7X|5.0|This is one of my favourite by Bowie, I love it from start to finish. It definitely has its own personal air, I love it and can't compare it to any other. Fantastic voyage.
1594630844|5.0|One of the best ways of learning in life is through experience.  You take risks, you make mistakes, you are miserable, you are happy. The list goes on and on.  As you go through life, you (hopefully) learn through all these different instances.  But, let me ask you this, why not take a shortcut and find out what's possibly in store for you beforehand?<br /><br />This is the greatest strength of this book.  The author outlines the experiences of numerous older Americans.  These older and experienced individuals share their stories about what is important in life and what they have learned from their mistakes and accomplishments in their personal and professional lives.  They share stories about what not to waste time on and why.  They talk about their love lives, their work lives, and everything in between.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil anything but this book is definitely worth the read.  You obviously won't find every story interesting but there will be nuggets of wisdom that will really make you think about your own life.  I have made extensive highlights in this book and I go back to from time to time when things get really hectic and stressful in my life.  These highlighted portions have been an immense help for me and they have helped lower the amount of stress and regret I face in my life.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|this movie left quite an impression on me! i will be watching it again! and it hit super close to home my goodness!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I have seen the story line before which isn't all that much but this effort was very well done.  The suporting actors make this work
B00CL68NOG|3.0|This movie was quite enjoyable, especially for Barbra Streisand fans. It was not nesely as funny as I thought it would be, but did have its moments. Seth Rogen's talents were under-utilized.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl simply is the last real rocker carrying the torch for Rock-n-Roll and it's historical significance.  The fact that he saved the old Neve Console at Sound City and continues to make great music on it makes him the last man standing.  Thank you, Dave Grohl for caring enough to save this important piece of history and for being the &#34;no BS&#34; dude that you are.<br />Buy this movie!!!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I found myself watching for hours. When I finished season one I had to have two as soon as possible.
B001NA6096|5.0|I watched this in preparation for Before Midnight. I can't believe I hadn't seen it before!  Wow. Such great writing. Phenomenal acting.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|My issue was with Amazon Streaming. Had to restart at least 10 times for a standard definition movie. The issue is not with my equipment as it is all the latest and greatest, no issues with any other streaming services. Amazon customer serivce did issue a recund when I contacted them by phone, don't e-mail. Hopefully they will get their product functioning.
B001NA2NMO|5.0|I was just looking for a free movie to help me fall asleep. I did not anticipate staying awake for the entire film. Strong story and acting. I was pleasantly surprised.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|me and my sister love this game so much.I love how I can train my horse and I can name my horse.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is fun, easy to play with lots of options, if you want a challenge make sure you try this game.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I loved it. Adventure, romance, intrique and good story line. DAniel Craig is very interesting and good actor.xxx xxx xx
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm so happy with this series so far.  I just wish they sold an edited pg-13 version for my teen daughters to read.  They love great books but there is too much sexual talk and profanity for them.  And I fully understand that's his style but the story is so good I just wish there was a cleaner version for them to read.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Very useful I have been looking for something like this for a really long time and thought I was going g to have to pay $100 plus but no this mixer is everything I needed to input xlr and phono jacks inputs' it also works well for audio out put to headphones and speakers
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|Populated with fascinating characters that are brought to stunning life by superb acting and script writing, all set in a realistic world; Tyrannosaur is a wonderful film. But be prepared. Unless you're as cold and rigid as an iron post driven six feet into a block of ice you'll be moved. Give it a look-see.
1451695195|5.0|I love this book! No matter what a person believes in, he/she will find this book interesting. I suggest to everyone
B005544TRQ|5.0|i enjoy the characters and the story line. It does not over do the action, sex or sleaziness...too much turns my interest away, it is just enough to be fun! and make me wonder how the big secret can be kept and what will happen next.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|i don't type fast but this reaction time is too slow...  I touch the first tile  then move my finger to tap the second one but it hasn't highlighted the first one yet, so I get no match till I go back and tap the first one agan.  really annoyingf
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Didn't expect much from this film and it was absolutely thought evoking, entertaining and beautiful. You would not regreat seeing this film
B008AYA7WE|1.0|just tooo hard to hold the tablet and more your thumbs around to control the dropping tile,  cant be the real thing
B00CW665VI|4.0|Holy hotness, Drew is just, well there aren't enough words to describe him.<br /><br />You want to love him, hate him, shake him until he can see what's right in front too him but you can't ;)<br /><br />But of course Drew being a guy needs to figure things out his own way...by screwing up!!!<br /><br />Love Drew. Love Kate and Love Mackenzie too!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm seriously addicted to this book. Seriously!!!  Very smartly written so that characters are real as is their emotions!  I can feel their frustration and desperation throughout the book. Sylvia Day has done an incredible job on creating a fabulous and seductive storyline!
1932907009|5.0|If you aspire to write novels or screenplay this book is a must. Snyder practical suggestion, and a fresh look at genre, the creative process, and pitching ideas.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It gives your mind a good workout.  I would recommend this highly. I can spend hours once I get started.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie immensely. It's a good adaptation of  Tolkien's work, and a lot of fun to watch. Peter Jackson did a great job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  is the best game ever. You should get it because it is an exciting running game . Best this is that it is free. So buy it u know u want to
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This film is great! Good visuals and special effects. Soundtrack is good too. You don't need to have read the book to enjoy.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Filled with passion and love, each track with it's own special nuances takes you to new places in your heart.<br />Thank you Mr. Bocelli and friends, once again.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I love the Herriot's series about his vet days on the Yorkshire downs.  They never fail to make me laugh and laugh!
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|Rival Sons embody everything that rock'n'roll stands for:  loud guitars, thumping bass lines, kicking drums, and swagger!  A throwback sound that brings the blues/soul/rock style all together and tied up in a nice bow.  Manifest Destiny Pt 1 and 2 in itself is worth the price of admission but with a handful of other stellar tracks you can't go wrong.  Fall in love with them and pick up the back catalog too.  Here's to the Rival Sons!  Cheers!~
B0077PBPJ6|2.0|This was a recommendation if you liked the show Downton Abbey but the only thing similar to the show was the time period.  It was a depressing movie and I never could sympathize with the characters.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|It was actually a pretty different movie than i expected.  I thought it was going to be another one of those terrible over the top scary movies (that ultimately don't even scare me), but it actually turned out to be a heartwarmer.  No spoilers, but i thought the movie did a pretty interesting job of balancing both the human and the supernatural side of life.  very awesome.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I could not stop reading. This is a happy read my kind of book! Tangled had it all everything I am looking for in a contemporary romance, humor, loads of hot juicy sex!
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Not so amazing, if you read the book the movie does not follow it jumps a little bit and moves too fast but the people they had playing the characters for really likeable and believable it just in with my attention too well.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love this app it's soooooooooo fun. I have almost unlocked all the blades and backgrounds. Favorite app of all time!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I've got though a lot they are hard but easy at the same time. I got the app as the free app of the day.
030758836X|5.0|It was fun becoming immersed in this page-turner.<br /><br />Like many novels it requires suspension of disbelief (obviously nobody is going to be arrested for murder after their wife is missing for a week or so - no body) but it was worth it because the book was so engaging and entertaining. The story had two (often unreliable) narrators - the husband and wife - and I got a kick out of the husband (Nick) who was a first person male narrator the way a woman would perceive the thought processes of a man to be. I'm used to male writers writing as female narrators; but this character was uniquely gratifying (and well wrought).
B0043RSK3K|5.0|Finally an easy to read history of US foreign policy and empire, like the British and French Empires the US empire was doomed before it ever got started. Empire is always evil no matter what our President says.
B005O64VH8|5.0|I bought this to listen at work, to destress and drown other sounds out.  Very beautiful music and very relaxing to listen to.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|Halfway into the movie it froze and I had to skip a few scenes that were actually important. Disappointed. Guess that's what I get, I knew it was used.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|this show is AWESOME!!!  from the beginning, it had a twin peaks feel to it...for me, at least.  the muted yet intense colours, the swish when Will is empathising, the nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach that something that will make my skin crawl is about to happen (and often does), the absolutely beautiful cinematography...i can't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />Hugh Dancy plays the disturbed Will quite well. his nervous little chuckles of disbelief that all this is happening to him is just what you would expect.<br /><br />Mads...Mads, Mads, Mads!  such subtle facial expressions.  that hint of a smile he can get when he knows the joke is on everyone else is something i look forward to seeing.<br /><br />this is far better than The Following.  better acting, easier to believe.  i thought The Following would be one season.  how will they keep stretching it out?  with Hannibal, since the killer of a majority of the victims is basically controlling and driving the investigation and nobody knows this, it's easier to see how he can get away with it.<br /><br />anyway, i await that whacked guy coming here and telling me i'm a shill, even though i'm not urging anyone to buy.<br /><br />uhoh!  published less than an hour and already 0 of 1 people found it helpful!  dude must have his settings to email him when someone comments so he can rush here and vote unhelpful on any reviews that are positive.  hmmm...it's funny that he accuses all of us, yet he is doing exactly the thing he accuses us of all doing, but in reverse.  dude needs to seek professional help.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved this story. It lets you think you know where it's going and then a twist. Though the topic was heartbreaking, I was inspired by these charecters. Well written and worth the tears.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Highly recommended.  Start from the first and watch each one, taking your time, and you won't be disappointed.  I would even think waiting a few days in between would make it more enjoyable.
B00A7W29BE|2.0|This is not a scanner, it's just a skin to turn your camera on,  take a picture with a couple of presets, then share it bus email, etc. A true scanner would enhance, make it into pdf, etc.  Useful but you can use your camera to do the same.
B004GYY714|4.0|A couple of times it cut off, but most of the time it is reliable, especially now that our local tower was damaged in strong winds a few weeks ago and I cannot access my favorite station on the radio.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|It was great,  I'm waiting for the other two. They are great entertainment for all ages.  If you like something just for the fun of it; these great.
0307155102|5.0|This is the best book to encourage speech in young children.  Both of my daughters and I enjoyed reading through this over 30 years ago.  This book was a gift for my daughter's baby shower.  I know this book with be well read by my grandchild and his/ her parents.
B00B5ARKDE|3.0|I was happy receiving the product but once I unpack and open the cover and was shock that the disc is black and white printed on it. I was dissappointed for the quality printing on the disc. But was happy with the figurine.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|This is good stuff I like this music and have no problem recommending it! Listen to the sample before buying.
0385333846|5.0|Compelling tale of an unhappy man and his  torment caused by his experiences in the army after being a POW and  witnessing the firebombing of Dresden. He does find happiness finally with his  out of body experiences on another planet.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This really is just a spectacular alarm app. It has a wealth if advanced settings and great features, such as limiting the times you are allowed to hit snooze or requiring that you solve math problems in order to turn off an alarm completely. The option for using a nice music playlist to wake up to on the weekends is also much appreciated. The UI is a bit simple looking and not very attractive, but it gets the job done.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Really enjoyed this!  Fun puzzles, just wish it lasted a little longer.  Can't wait until the next &quot;room&quot; is revealed!
B004PIA4BI|5.0|I bought this to replace my Xperia's battery and it gave me no problems at all and I'm writing this review months after purchase. So if you needed this for a replacement it should do the trick just fine.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|For anyone who follows the news, the latest scares, the latest fad foods. A good reminder to be skeptical and to actually think about what news really means. Plus, he's pretty funny.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I'll keep this simple since I'm pretty sure there is many many other reviews on here for this glorifying it. This is a great movie and is well worth your time and money. Plus it's been out for a long time so tons of people have already spoken about this movie and how great it is.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like the feel of this one. When my shark eats and eats he gets bigger and bigger. He can even jump out the water a little and snag him a human being. He can swim in shallow water but he will need to go down deep to breathe right, so take care of him. I like seeing him feed on things. You will too.
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|this game sucks i mean how does it even work i mean i just deleted as soon as i got it cause i didnt understand what it meant
B004SRNH10|3.0|Adobe Air I am not sure if I like you or not, as I am not sure that I did purchase you. I am so confused right now.
0525478183|5.0|As soon as you start reading this book you get hooked. I just couldn't stop reading John Green's work. As a teenager reading this book has been a great experience. Easy to understand but manages to be deep at the same time. Great mystery, and in a way romantic comedy book.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Very addictive .good mind game . Highly recommend.great time waster great for all ages. Can play anytime anywhere good for your brain
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is awesome ... if Jurassic park actually was a successful park that never closed down due to greedy fat guy lol... this is what you get ... I like it a lot and the best part is that it's free :)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My 6 year old daughter and I love this game! We try to out-drive each other all the time. It is very addictive.
B00CEB5QU2|3.0|Take any star rating I give this device with a grain of salt. It's hideously underdocumented and seems like it should be able to do a lot more than it does.<br /><br />We have here a tiny, tiny media server. One of the smallest thin servers I've ever seen, and certainly the smallest device intended for that function. Functionally it's probably nothing that a seasoned Raspberry Pi owner couldn't do for less than a hundred bucks, but who wants to go through the trouble? The iOS client is fairly simple, and if you're comfortable with network basics you can also access it via a built-in webserver from the desktop. It can handle any SD card or USB flash drive, and can even (barely) manage a USB hard drive or optical disc drive if it's plugged into external power. The actual user interface is three LEDs, one of which changes color to represent power levels. It doesn't have a print server, but if Kingston released the firmware source code, it probably wouldn't be any problem to implement. The phone charger aspect? I dunno. It's a gimmick; I'm not impressed.<br /><br />But... I'm not crazy about this device. One big problem is that it can operate as a wireless media server or a USB SD card reader, but not both at the same time; the \\"power\\" switch is more of a mode switch. I truly do not understand why it behaves this way; it seems like lazy programming at best, utterly incompetent design at worst. Another is that it seems like Kingston intentionally doesn't want it used for more than it's advertised as (see print server comment above); settings are very limited, and its default IP address is hard-coded, which is intensely annoying and guarantees that you won't be able to use more than one of them on the same network. (Really? REALLY?!)<br /><br />Honestly, assuming it's even possible to do a firmware upgrade, most of these problems should be easily fixed. Till then, maybe Samba on a Raspberry Pi is a better choice. Add a print server, fix the mode-switch problem, and make the networking capabilities a bit more flexible, this is a five star product. As it is, it's a gimmick.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Bought this in Feb 2013 to amplify headphones connected to my netbook.  Did a great job for three months.  The battery would no longer take a charge by May 2013.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Had the LaserDiscs, actually still do. (original versions, not the digitally upgraded versions)  Had the DVD's, yep still have those too.  Now have the Blu Rays.  I remember watching all these at the UA Cinema 150 in Seattle.  The very first one was such an incredible rush.  I actually delayed a flight departure back to my home in Anchorage so I could see it.  Then after moving to Seattle, saw the other two at the same theater.  Still enjoy them and although not a big Yoda fan, Frank Oz did a remarkable job giving him much more personality than in the newer files....although watching Yoda kick ass in the new films was fun too.
B00AUA67GQ|3.0|If you are looking for a place to keep notes on your tablet or Kindle this will work for you.
B000PMG16U|4.0|It's STAR WARS, what else can you say.  Replaced standard DVD with Blu ray.  Had to be done.  Plus I'm sure George Lucas needs the money.
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|**Spoilers** I have mixed feelings about this book, I guess my major issue is that I'm not a big fan of the 'insta-love' formula, but I can digest it if there's some good relationship development afterwards. But 'insta-love' + 'alpha-male-turned-puppy' is a big no-no for me. I guess that the 'mating' thing is a way (very popular, by the way) for writers to get free from actually creating a romance and give some sense as to why the characters belong together. We just get it shoved into our heads with the you-are-mine excuse. Praise authors who doesn't do this and go through the trouble of actually making us fall in love too (i.e. Jeaniene Frost, Ilona Andrews)<br />Leaving all that aside, it was an ok read, though it was rather slow. I gave it three stars because the last third of the book was a bit more interesting than the rest of it. I'm not convinced of Dragos and Pia either, there's little (if none) chemistry between them. And he has no respect whatsoever for her and the worst, she's ok with it. How did the author managed to turn him into a puppy but at the same time keep his neanderthal-like demeanor is beyond me. Again, the story itself had potential, the characters not so much. I'm not sure if I'll give the series another try.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Watching America Held Hostage, night after night in 1979 was surreal at times.  But the story behind the story is so amazing.  Thanks to Ben and the production team for making almost a flawless, historic movie about a horrible event.  These people were many of the pawns that big government uses then cast aside.  Thank goodness for the few people like Tony Mendez.  He's a hero and now everyone knows it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a fun game - like Angry Birds...can be addicting. If you like Angry Birds you should like this one.
B004L03B3S|3.0|OK the movie was good but I hate the end of it I had to make up my own ending just to like the hole thing great love story you cant tell there half brothers not really great sex its sweet how they love one another I love there mom she a real good mom to them not a long movie I liked it but I would not pay at lot for the movie but im a girl and not gay but I love some gay movies if there sweet and have a love story in it I really like this movie its funny cool sweet I only wish it was in English than it would be a lot more better but good job anyway
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really have had fun with this game. It's like trying to get thru a maze. Each level gets harder. However, have to put it down and re-visit it sometimes if you get to a level that's not immediately intuitive.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Please read this! It was a little slow going for me at the start but wow. I loved this book.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|If you ever watch the TV show, and follow it, these are fantastic shows.  I'm so happy they put them on DVD.  Now, i can continue keeping up with what has happened.
B0096BIENY|2.0|These guys are each wonderful on their own, but all are primadonnas and cannot blend.  It offends my ears hearing their cacophanous struggle.
145210655X|5.0|This is a great book for Star Wars fans and would be a great present for Father's Day! However, you need to have a bit of Star Wars knowledge to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />This book shows Darth Vader and Luke as father and son, and focus on their every day life in the Star Wars universe.  It is full of images from the original Star Wars movies, but it doesn't follow a specific timeline like the next book in this series: [[ASIN:1452118698 Star Wars: Vader's Little Princess]].<br /><br />It is a very funny book for a couple of chuckles. Highly recommended for Star Wars fans.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Liked the book.  A little improbable but still enjoyed the characters.  Kept me interested throughout the book.  Enjoyed the author and would read more from her.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This movie is absolutely hilarious.  I often find myself begrudgingly sitting through yet another kids movie with my 6 year old daughter, but this one I actually WANT to watch.  Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast is absolutely hysterical.  There is enough of a humor balance where little kids are very entertained, but adults catch the little nuances that make it so funny.  Appropriate for kids too! (Sometimes &#34;kids&#34; movies are more geared towards adults, this one is great for both.)<br />Love!!!!
B00AAX68HG|1.0|When I first got this game for my kindle fire hd  I thought it would be a good game but after five mins or so it is plain boring so don't get this game ;(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I used to have this game on my I pad then it broke so I got a kindle and I spent a lot of time trying to find it now I h a have!!!!
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Much longer than the original movie. It has added story lines that are not in the original.<br />I like it much better than the shorter version. Just be aware that it is over 3 hours long!
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is great i love it. Building my dragon city is a daily quest i look forward to. Just seeing the awesome dragons you can come up with is great.Just wish you  could battle them like you can on dragon city on Facebook.
0689835604|5.0|I love reading these books to my 4 month old. She doesn't really get it & can't flip the flaps, but I read them because they are fun & keep her attention. She always smiles at all my crazy antics as we find baby's belly button, toes, fingers etc. Great author with a great idea. Love them all!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I just love this character though I resist the idea that Eric will be out of Sookie's life. Next book please.
0345529057|5.0|I thought I would get discouraged with the &#34;cast of thousands&#34;, but it only seems important to know the main 50 or so.<br />I've never seen the HBO series, can't imagine it's better than the books.  A great collection.
B002OSXDAU|1.0|Amazon lost or changed my card number and claim that I need to fix payment method. When I go in to do so I can't find the number they have in there except for the last 4 digits, and they are correct. As far as the book, well I'll be by Barnes and Noble tomorrow.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|this is a stupid app. it needs a camra and when I took a picture of the wall it came up as the aneroid guy.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I have read other books by Sanderson and have always enjoyed it. Definitely 5 stars. Can't wait for his next one in the series. I think it is supposed to be out in November.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would enjoy listening to a CD after seeing how great their DVDs are, but the CD is very good.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The quality was great, as expected, and I loved having the ultraviolet copy. It is nice to just add it to my ultraviolet account and then watch it where ever I am. Highly recommend.
B00122EX4Y|5.0|This is Mark's best album since Dire Straits - and contains his best song of all time ever - Love and Happiness.  Gorgeous!!!!
B000FC11A6|5.0|Cryptonomicon not only is a great read the first time, but in my opinion is worth a 2nd and 3rd read.  The historical and scientific and adventure threads all are woven together in a terrific read.  World War II buffs will enjoy, computer geeks will appreciate it and historical fiction lovers will not be able to put it down.  I highly recommend it.  It's a long read - so get ready to lose yourself in a world created and narrated by Neal Stephenson.  When you re-emerge from the book you can explain where you've been to your friends and family, and hand the book on.  But be sure to get it back.  You will want to reread this book.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Great book.  I had to keep reminding myself that it was a memoir and not fiction.  Amazing story of perseverance.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|The only feature it has beyond being a basic camera app is the ability to save multiple images within one PDF.  You can do this with the Google drive apps as well.  The Google Drive app also does basic OCR for the purpose of search.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is a lot of fun  I love it but  if you don't have $1.99 to spend to unlock the the rest of the game your stuck with one girl out of four there are other examples of this throughout the game like when your putting mascara on the princess you only get  yellow and black when there are two others and the brushes you can only use two out of four. The rest of the game also has lots of items locked but I have to say the dresses are amazing so much Color compared to wedding salon. I think when the game is free it really should be free
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|works great..love this game..very intertaining...great to play when waiting for kids to get off bus or waiting for an appointment.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|I know this is a movie adaptation, but it is so well crafted that I just had to do a review. Ladies and gentlemen: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I have read the books and They are absolutely wonderful from start to finish. Even 12 years later, and yet this movie is still a timeless classic. I seriously enjoy Harry Potter. Chris Columbus is a great director and watching this movie (as many times as I have) you can really tell that his heart was in the right place in making this story into one of the best movies I have seen. If you have read the books by author J K Rowling, it is obvious that the book and movie are two completely different things but the great thing I can say about Harry Potter films as a whole, is that they ALL stay close to the books; so I don't mind the films being as long as they are. Now on to the acting.<br />There are actors who get offered movie roles, while there are actors who audition and get lucky. Luck had nothing to do with Daniel Radcliffe; because like it or not,  He IS Harry Potter. The way he moves, acts, everything about him is Harry Potter. Rupert Grint: Perfect choice for Ron Weasley (there is a humorous side to his character). Emma Watson: intelligence, wit, charm, and grace, Excellent choice for Hermione Granger. Tom Felton: again, HE IS Draco Malfoy, his movements, persona, etc. Alan Rickman as Severus Snape: dark, quiet, and just plain strange, so its easy to see why he plays Severus Snape. The actors chosen for Harry Potter all were spectacular. The story  line is intriguing as it is beguiling. And there are NO dull moments in Harry Potter. Fantasy, New worlds, and things that childhood imaginations are made of are what this movie has to offer. All in all, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is a cleverly brilliant movie that is easy to watch.<br /><br />5 Stars
B0098466CK|5.0|Bought it just after release and still listen to it on a consistent basis over half a year later.  Definitely one of my favorite albums ever. Not many albums that I can listen to its entirety and like every song. This is one of them. Love the energy, guitar rifts and unique lyrics.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|i always love the national<br />and i find this new album is just as great as the old albums<br />no letdowns<br />kudos
B00AQMQBKK|4.0|Excellent games for the Kindle Fire!!<br /><br />I have had no issues with the games and plays well just like the board game.<br /><br />Warn you will lose a lot but fun game

B00003CXE7|4.0|The movie itself was good,  but unfortunately the disc itself was defective (kept &#34;freezing up&#34;), so I had no choice but to return it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Coll very entertaining and keep me busy all the y<br />Time I think it is way better than temple run
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Great quick read, I couldn't put it down.  Robert Langdon stories are so fun, I can wait to read Inferno.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|The game looks great.  I really like the use of the gyroscope in game play. However, it's a little laggy on my Kindle Fire.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|As a middle-aged, college educated Black man from &#34;the south&#34;, I was shocked. Haven't we seen enough movies about the brutality of Black slavery in America? Must &#34;we&#34; be constantly reminded of &#34;our&#34; history in this country? I can't even put into words the outrage I felt watching this awful mess. Jamie Foxx is such a talented young man. Did he really need this part on his resume'? I've always been a fan of Samuel L. Jackson...until now. Jackson must have sold his soul to the devil and was forced to play the part of an ignorant old fool to get an extension on his satanic contract. D'Jango got to kill some White people; so what! This movie is awful! The language is horrible. I'm very disappointed. TWO THUMBS DOWN!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say, a brilliant game to pass the time when travelling. Always fun and entertaining and the graphics quality is excellent.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|This is an old family favorite that I purchased for our youngest generation.  The two year old loves it and the rest of us like it enough that we don't mind hearing it over and over and over....
B0000214F1|5.0|GREETINGS & SALUTATIONS! Be really sure that no children get to view this film on DVD, its a pioneer in Italian film making along with the films made by Frederico Fellini. The film started the major interest in Caligula and led to a revival of ancient Roman history which had never been seen this way, a gritty, frightening film of a brutal life in Caesar's world during the overthrow of various leaders like Caesar, Nero and Caligula. These is a well acted piece with big name stars performing at their best. There are two versions of this film, this one in longer and more interesting and fills in the gaps and makes it easier to follow the plot. Try to get this version if you can!
B000Z27HLS|4.0|It is an excellent screenwriting of Jane Austin and was well cast and directed .  What else us there to say?
B00913DPW2|5.0|If you don't own The Haunt and The Haunt 2, you MUST add them to your collection; I promise you that you will play these games over and over again.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This was a great dictionary to use..it has all the definitions I would ever need in my whole entire life.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game; The graphics are really good and easy to play on the KFHD.  It is a must have for your collection.
B003TXKSWK|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this album. To combine two great talents and for them to sing great songs, I'm happy.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I play Temple Run OZ a lot and even though it is a bit repeditive, it is always fun to play.  I like the graphics and the hot air balloon.<br />It is more challenging than reg. Temple Run.  Caution to children & adults with epilepsy (that would be me), don't spend a lot of straight time playing this game; it has a tendency to make me sick so I never play it for more than 30 min. without taking a break.
B008JFUPBC|2.0|I'm not sure why anyone would give this five stars but that's what I noticed when I decided to review this myself. I was never impressed with Jaden's other attempts at acting and this has not made me feel any better about that. He had too big a part in a movie that should have been taken control of by Will Smith. Lots of special affects but that will only get you so far. I'll probably never buy it on Blu Ray or any other way. Sorry.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is the cutest game ever, it's your smarts and wit that allows these little fairies to build their homes under the Tree of Life.  I still have it on my KFHD carousel and play it often.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  Am going online to by the next.  Great plot- story was unusual but believable and well worth the purchase.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|for read for many ages.  i would wait for a kid to be more in the 12 range because of some of the violence.  its good for adults too. real quick read
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|I have not read the books so this review is simply on the movie.  I did enjoy it and it was fairly good.  I will say that I did struggle to get past the first 45 minutes.  The ending was pretty good and was definitely the highlight.  It will be interesting to see if they make the sequals or not.
B000026OW3|5.0|This is an amazing collection for the price! Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it, he was amazed at the price too. :)
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is a huge download but the graphics are top notch. The puzzles are a nice challenge. They're occasionally tough but not impossible or frustrating. It's a nice game for kicking back.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Just finished this book. I've been reading it each night while on a camping trip and the overall short length and rugged compelling story made for a great reading experience while I've been out here. I definitely recommend it
B003C5FMEE|5.0|What's not to love!  As a New Orleans native I've watched Trombone Shorty as a little boy.  His talent was evident then so no surprise he has come so far.  Wonderful local success story.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Totally enjoyed this History of the Eagles....will watch again and again.  Things you learn and enjoyed the interviews ans music
B00008BXJ6|5.0|It's a classic so how can you go wrong with this purchase. Not much else to say about this CD.
B0064W65UM|5.0|As anyone who's read Alan Moore before knows, the man is an absolute genius and the same goes for artist David Lloyd. Moore equals if not tops his work on the watchmen and Lloyds artwork is absolutely stunning. If you've have not read this yet, even if you're not a fan of graphic novels, you must give it a try. I promise it will blow you away. And if you've seen the movie this masterpiece blows it out of the water. Mind you, this is coming from someone who not only saw the movie first but considers it one of their all time favorite films. Buy this now and you won't be disappointed
B0074EIQUG|5.0|This album rates as one of his top, if not the top.  He certainly gets better with age.  I actually purchased this CD for my 5 year old as he loves &#34;Locked Down&#34;.  I get the added perk of listening to Dr. John while driving him to school in the morning!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a fun game. There is lots to build and discover. If you don't like zombies like me but like to find and have to try to survive on your own survival mod on peaceful is the best. Basically if you like to build this is a game for you.
B00992CF6W|2.0|the stupid game deleted all of my worlds and i had amazing things. the game glitched and skrewed everything up.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I use Evernote a lot, but my photo document uploads always looked out of focus. My &quot;scans&quot; with this app look fantastic. Great product.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|You have to read this book.  It tells a wonderful story of love of family no matter color.  It is also a book of slavery and hatred and perseverance in spite of it. It is very compelling and wonderfully written. A great page turner. I couldn't put it down.
B0097K21YW|5.0|This game is wonderful helps by keeping you on your toes.I would recommend this game to anyone.who likes games some of the levels are very hard.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|The app is not bad at detecting the borders of documents which it will use to crop. You are able to readjust the borders of the auto selected crop in case it cuts off part of your bardcode/doc.<br />When taking a picture of the barcode it will often crop too much and add extra parts that are the barcode. Yet, it is easy to change the selection that you need cropped.<br />Has enchantments for color correction which is useful if the white balance is off. Can enhance to just black and white if your needs require that. Taking a photo seems to be tricky sometimes as when I try to sometimes won't take a photo. I have to precisely hit the button. It may be do to the fact that my device has high PPI.<br />Does do an easy export job that is very simple to put into Skydrive or you can send it over bluetooth.<br />Had a problem in the gallery and it keeps saying image couldn't be loaded. There is an empty square where it should be. Found out that just selecting the image then hitting the delete button in the corner fixed the problem.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just getting in to the game and have been asked three times to rate it.  At this point I can say that it looks like it will be a good game. It is also asking me to share every single accomplishment on Facebook.  I'm really hoping that won't continue through the entire game.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Never knew this movie existed but an thrilled my friend recommended it. I have watched this movie over and over and enjoy it every minute of it. Just be sure to get this version by Raymond Briggs' the other versions are not as good (in my opinion).
B0091REZMW|2.0|There's a lot of apps that want you to spend cash on in game purchases but few go as far as this one. You can only play a short time before you have to wait for hours to be able to play again or pay to play. I like hidden object games but too often they're used as part of a story line... 'find these 20 things to advance the story...' and to me that's just not a lot of fun.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|I heard one song from this cd on the radio and fell in love with Mayer Hawthorne. I grew up in the 70's and listened to alot of soul and R&B. His sound brings back so many great memories. His voice is gorgeous, and his songs are not only good rhythmically, but the lyrics are creative and funny. What a treat!
B007V2UGPE|1.0|This game took 1 hour to download on my kindle fire HD. All I have to say is terrible downloading for 1 game deliciously...
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is beautiful music from my favorite place on earth. It makes me feel like I am sitting on a lanai in Hawaii watching the ocean and feeling the warm breeze. I love it.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|But this company deserves it! If you get the game there should not be any \\"take backs\\" on the available content. I got this game because I like the Dash games for the PC and I thought it would be great to have them for traveling yet I ended up only getting half the locations and a request for it to allow ad's in my game.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book.  It was amazing.  The characters and story line...and I loved the chemistry between them.  Now, I did watch the movie after reading to see the difference.  Huge differences...but the movie was still good.  The book was awesome though!
B004HO6HWK|3.0|Great movie ... now that we finally own a copy on BluRay in a format we are able to watch ... beware purchases, BluRays also have regions like the original DVD ... lesson learned the hard way !
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|Black Star Riders' first album is exactly what you'd expect: rock and roll songs that sound a little like Thin Lizzy, but not entirely. I would put this well behind Lizzy albums like Fighting, Black Rose, and Bad Reputation (my personal favorite Lizzy albums), but that's not to say it isn't good. It's good... just not Lizzy at the top of their game-good. I you like Lizzy or melodic class rock, you'll like this.
B003UESJHY|3.0|Great movie ... now that we finally own a copy on BluRay in a format we are able to watch ... beware purchases, BluRays also have regions like the original DVD ... lesson learned the hard way !
B0090EJR1K|5.0|I love movies that aren't afraid to touch taboo areas.  Life is too serious, we all need to be able to make fun of ourselves.  I laughed so hard at Borat, but it was a little hard to watch the unsuspecting people in the movie.<br /><br />I loved that this was all actors, and a lot of great ones at that.  Definitely one to watch after the kiddos go to bed!
B000065DWH|5.0|Randy Newman is a master of his art and craft. Contains music that will make you laugh and cry, and maybe curse human behaviour but applaud the human spirit.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|There are some very interesting portions to this story but overall I felt as if there were too many sections that just dragged on.  With that being said, the second half was much better than the first.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It SO helps put my 4 year boy to sleep.  Bedtime is much easier now.<br />This app is amazing!  Would recommend this app to anyone who has difficulty falling asleep.
B008966SLM|3.0|As usually Cray exhibits strong talent in his songs, however, I was disappointed in the song selection.  It seems to me that soemthing is missing---and for me it was the fact that many of the songs lacked the conviction usually emanating from the words of each song.  Do not get it twisted, I will continue to listen to Cray, I just hope better songs are selected for the next CD.
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|The style it was written and told in really irritated me. It's not your typical story. I had such high hopes for this book but was let down. I enjoyed the first chapter and the rest was just garbage. Details can be great but this book absolutely over did it. If you're looking for a book with a beginning, middle, and end, this book is not for you.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|People who say that this is a 1 star game are unaware that to fix the nonloadingness is just to update your game not your device
B002ZG98UA|3.0|the first copy would not play, reordered a second copy (with no problems) and I still had trouble plying that one.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I waited way too long to read this novel.  I thoroughly enjoyed it! It is a great read.  I intend to read the sequel.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|This is a beautiful, and deeply touching film.  It is so faithful to the book that, if you view the film and then read the book, you can not fail to admire the adaptation.  Admirably, it captures the era and tone of the story without the excessive hype and glitz that mars the Baz Luhrmann remake.  The casting of the lead roles in this production seems so much more appropriate to the characters portrayed.  The film bears many repeat viewings.  It is wonderful that it has now been released in an exquisite Blu Ray version.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|All the discs have a surface scratch in them so they skip occasionally, I'm probably going to send it back after I watch them.  These discs were brand new out of the package, and you can visually see the scratch.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The story was good but the finish could have been better. Nicely developed story was left of wanting to more better finish.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|If you're a child of the 60's...... who doesn't love the Doors.  I used to have this in an LP, now I have it in CD format.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I love Mitch Alboms books... I have purchased all most all of them.  They are all GREAT..Recommended reading for those that like to think!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|This is a well done, great CGI integrated movie.  I'm looking forward to the sequel coming out sometime this year
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This backpack has room for my camera and several lenses.  It is also commodious enough to accommodate any other attachments I wish to carry.  I also like the numerous pockets outside of the central compartment.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|If you're a child of the 60's, most likely you have this record.  I never owned the record, and finally got this CD and it brings back a nostalgia.
B003TNW044|5.0|Great Quality and amazing show. This is without the box set which i like more because its easier to travel with
B001AQT0RC|4.0|I had to have one on DVD, and in Blu-Ray, even better so I got it and I'm most happy
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Works great &amp; has lots of options. Only thing I'd change is to have an option for something other than a voice alarm.
B00013F38K|5.0|I truly loved this show when it was on the air, and I watched the reruns that stopped.  There was a lot of good philosophy in this series.  Forget the actual kung fu in the show, it was about the lessons learned or taught.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I love the film and Tarantino did it again. Sam L. Jackson is funny and Leonardo is quite good as is the German actor and Jamie Foxx. For those who are very sensitive to the &#34;N&#34; word this film is full of it...
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|This is definitely a great movie, but you definitely need to buy it and watch it a few times to absorb all that's going on.
B001BIMYXQ|5.0|This collection of Eurythmics is their best effort yet at putting together a retrospective of their incredible rise in pop music. This cd also includes their 2005 hit single, &#34;I've Got a Life&#34;.  With more than 80 million albums sold in their career, this is a great value. I love Dave and Annie, aka: D-n-A....
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is a well done, great CGI integrated movie.  I'm looking forward to the sequel coming out sometime this year.  But the biggest part is the message, it's not about warring.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is fantastic. The only drawback is when my KINDLE LOST DATA I lost all my original points. I had to reinstall the game and start at the beginning.

0439023491|4.0|I was a bit skeptical as I began reading The Hunger Games, earlier this year. The hype of The Hunger Games had reached a high, and I couldn't help but see what all the fuss was about. I quickly read the first novel and was pleasantly surprised. Upon completion, I decided that the novel was an entertaining way to comment on social and cultural topics. I did feel that there was room for improvement, but was invested enough to continue with the sequel, Catching Fire.<br /><br />The novel finds Katniss adjusting to life as a victor of The Hunger Games. For those unfamiliar with the games, it is an annual event in which each of the twelve districts of Panem, a distopian version of the US, send a boy and a girl to fight to the death in commemoration of the historic revolution. The people of Katniss's home district 12 are used to working hard to barely stay afloat. As the victor of the games, however, Katniss has a new home and more money that she is accustom to. Despite this, she longs for her life before the games.<br /><br />Her victory was unconventional, to say the least. For the first time in the history of the games, Katniss was not the sole victor. After a strange turn of events that saw her acting like she fell in love with Peeta, the boy competing from district 12, the pair both were named victors and given all of the perks that come with the title. But with this unconventional victory came many unforeseen consequences. While Katniss only acted like she loved Peeta, for the sake of the games, Peeta truly fell in love with Katniss. Still, Katniss's heart belongs to her best friend and hunting partner, Gale. On a larger level, Katniss's victory was perceived as an act of defiance against the Capitol, and threatens to spark a whole new revolution. Now Katniss must try to mend her personal life while convincing the president and citizens of Panem that she never intended to cause problems.<br /><br />This novel was quite an improvement over the first novel. With all of the backstory and history fully established, Collins was able to devote more time to discovering the emotional layers of each character, even those that initially seemed to be only supporting roles. There is a political thriller permeating the young adult/fantasy exterior of this novel, that allows for quick pacing and darker undertones. Without giving away the story, there were several strong twists that I genuinely didn't see coming. Towards the end, the novel teetered on the edge of predictability, but managed to provide a satisfying ending that promises for an exciting conclusion to the trilogy.f the backstory and history fully established, Collins was able to devote more time to discovering the emotional layers of each character, even those that initially seemed to be only supporting roles.

B00594XOZU|4.0|I had this app on my phone and its different for the kindle fire. the one on my phone had settings where you can change the color of the bubble this one does not. On my phone you could get memes, videos, and funny pics on this one you can't. Over all I really like kik but I also really liked the other features.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|One of my favorite classes in our MIS degree at Baylor was Van Gray's Product Operations Management, as he related most of his plant operation information systems to Goldratt's \\"The Goal\\". I was very pleasantly surprised to find the parallels that the authors of \\"The Phoenix Project\\" took linking plant operations and workflow to the flow of IT. Not only does it make perfect sense, but it really does accelerate time to market for many projects. I would highly recommend this book to anyone in IT, Operations, or a business unit struggling to work with their technology departments.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved it and I hated to put it down. I didn't want the story to end. 5 stars from me.

B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I enjoy this game!! I actually downloaded it for my 5yr. old grand-daughter but when she is not playing it I am.<br />It tests your skills as you jump Little Luna from moon to moon keeping her away from the Evil Crab Man...<br />Its just an awesome game.....
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was surprised that I really liked this book. I'm wondering how they will translate it to the movie without losing the style though. That's what really made it work.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Sounds original while offering homage to great 70's prog bands.  This album will please fans of early Procupine Tree. Buy it!

B00COGZ8FU|1.0|This is the thrid time I have purchased a movie for my Kindle Fire with the intent to download it and watch it on a plane, but not been able to download (in this case not even watch). It doesn't happen often, but when it does it makes the Samsung or the Google tablets look that much better. In this case I got an error message that indicated I didn't have enough memory to download the movie, but was able to download another one no problem. I finally just decided to watch it and (cmon!) same error message. Bummer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down till finished -  now going for the third!!<br />Thank you for giving us entrance into your imagination, Suzanne Collins!

B0091THDOM|5.0|This is a great product!  I had purchased a hard plastic case with a silicone skin.  While it did protect the phone, it made getting it in and out of my pocket next to impossible.  This case is better than advertised.  The phone fits snugly & is easy to retrieve, the case has a thin profile & a fashionable look, and it slides easily into & out of any pocket.  Bravo Snugg!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I have 3 of the Cut the Rope games. They're very enthralling and fun. I am always delighted to see what new bits of genius the creators add to each installment. They always play perfectly, too. I have never seen one glitch. Definitely worth the money.

Thank you for this great,awesome,cool app!!!!!!!  ;-) thanks for reading my opinion!!!!!!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Good game.  I really enjoy it.  The only problem is that it freezes up from time to time.  That is very frustrating when you are almost finished.  All in all I really am enjoying it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is happy sad changes your feelings at ever page. I cried I laughed and sang. If you love to read adventure books , love story's  , fiction , prediction , or any other story pick up this trilogy. Once you do you won't be abel to put it down. I love all the characters. All very described. Suzanne Collins wonderful story . I would like to read more of her books.

B006QPX6IG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites.  In my opinion this is the best ever movie about the Civil War!
0425252868|5.0|I'm not a fast reader, so it takes me time to read a book, but if there was any way i could have read it slower i would have, this book is to be savored like a fine wine, not super technical and not boring even in the slower parts of the book, highly recommended to any reader, especially younger readers. This is a life lesson that everyone should learn. A big two thumbs up to the author
B002P73UQW|5.0|Light-hearted show whose characters will remind you of someone you know. Clever writing.Well timed comedic acting. Give the show several episodes before you decide if you like it. Warning it is addicting.<br /><br />While you do not have to be any of the following to enjoy the show immensely, the inside jokes aimed at you will feel like icing on the cake if you are: Trekkies, The digitally inclined, Superheroes, Aspiring Actresses, Self-proclaimed Nerds, Comic book lovers, Science Fiction fans, Physicists, Star Wars Lovers etc.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Not once was I informed that this game wouldn't work for Kindle fire. Even though it says Kindle tablet edition in the name. Stupid me for thinking the Kindle fire is a tablet. I would really love my coins back or for the game to work, like it should.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|Love the filming.  Mignes is the best Carmen I have ever seen, and I have been listening to and watching this opera for 62 years!  I won't claim that her voice is the best I've ever heard, but she is such a delight as Carmen that I'd almost watch it w.o. the music!<br /><br />Seriously, my first \\"Carmen\\" was Rise Stevens, about 62 years ago, and I listened to it several times times at the Library!  One day in the midst of a snowstorm I wandered into a record shop.  Business was so slow that they practically gave me the album, and I anticipated hearing it the entire 2 hours that it took me to get home by public transportation.<br /><br />This movie truly brings it to life.  Maybe in the day of Rise Stevens it would have been impossible to have such a Carmen on stage or in the theater, but one should remember that this opera was booed on opening night.  It showed women smoking!  Also, it was about Gypsies and soldiers, not great heroes, kings, or mythological characters.  So, this version perhaps brings us back to the original intent of Bizet.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I like having pinball games on the go.  This free app is fun!  There are 3 free pinball games, which you can play over and over.  I used to play pinball on my computer, so now it's fun to be able to play again anywhere on my tablet
B00ATP24NW|5.0|Excellent deal. I was cheaper to buy the whole CD and get MP3 download version free. I like every song on the disk.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very good game for all bronies that have a device to play this game and do like my little pony
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  Hosseini again brings to life the people of Afghanistan and it is as if I know them.  He draws them so well and clearly. He mixed the chapters artfully so that they would always come back to something that would bring a memory from earlier in the story.  Ths story of the div taking the beloved son really affected me.  I enjoyed this book.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I haven't read the book. Hadn't heard of the book until I read the summary of this movie.<br /><br />With no expectations (I didn't bother to read any reviews, and I didn't catch the star rating here on amazon), I fired it up.<br /><br />I was charmed, enchanted (no puns intended, as this is a movie about witches), and most importantly, thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />The two main characters, \\"Lena\\" and \\"Ethan\\" had undeniable chemistry. The young actor, who played Ethan, had Southern charm reminiscent of Matthew McConaughey. The acting, overall, was very natural and believable of the two young people.<br /><br />Emma Thompson really steals the show (you'll know what I mean when you get to the monologue in the church...)<br /><br />Quite honestly, the production, direction, overall execution of this movie, was far more superior than the Twilight films 2-4 which were pretty god awful. There was a lot of creative moments in the movie. It was highly stylized without distracting from the writing. The color palate was green, blue, and grey.<br /><br />It's a shame this movie is bogged down by the rabid novel comparisons.<br /><br />Bottom line - I was never bored, I laughed, I cared about the characters, and I was completely entertained, and totally absorbed by the sweet love story.  If that's all you can ask for in a film, then I highly recommend this one.
B0018BB20W|5.0|Of course this review is going to get 5 stars. It's a fantastic album. Packaging and shipping and all that was good as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed this book, deep topics but with a nice twist of romance and steam. I would definitely read another book by college hoover
B0018BB21G|5.0|This rating is going to get 5 stars but that's mostly thanks to the moody blues. Great album start to finish. Package arrived on time and intact as well.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this game is awesome and so addictive, in a good way :P Once you fey past the first few levels its pretty challenging.. I was concentrating so hard I didn't even notice when someone came in the room.
B006LSZECO|5.0|While I won't write a lengthy review like most other commentators on here, I will say this: This book was excellent, fast-paced and smart. For those who are turned off by crime novels because you think they're cliche or poorly written, think again! Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer who can somehow make you love and hate a character (the villain, no less!) at the same time.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|so this freebie will have to do. it's okay.. serves the purpose. no complaints, because it is free and i only need to use it ever so often.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have been using this app for a few months now and I can honestly I say this is a real useful app. I also have the phone app and can jot down notes when I'm out and about and have all my notes in sync on the desktop pc, tablet or on my smart phone.<br /><br />Great note taking app all around.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|the app in my opinion seems to be limited at times. but it's just an app. i can get a quick peek at whats going on with my &#34;friends&#34; so it's good in a pinch. i struggle with it a little on the Kindle, but the app overall is ok
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I do not have any strong feelings toward Tina Fey, positively or negatively. I have enjoyed some of the movies that she has been in, so I thought I'd check out this book on my Kindle for a laugh.  I could not have been more bored.  I got 12 percent in to the book and had not even cracked a smile!  I filed it under \\"too boring to finish.\\"  I wouldn't waste your time.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It's an ok app. helps to pass a little time if i'm out somewhere and don't want to get too involved with serious reading or anything. Can get boring after a bit, but hey, it's free.
140053271X|4.0|It's the perfect ebook reader and plus you can install Android OS to see mail (a good help sometimes). Long batterylife, can read nearly all ebook.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|What is there to say about Carole King that hasn't been already said. She is a LEGEND. Love her music. So glad we can get the &#34;old music&#34; in not only CD form but as MP3 format.
B00CL50LEC|3.0|The movie was okay, not a great Zombie movie. I like my zombies dumb and getting their heads blasted apart. I knew this wasn't that type of Zombie flick since I had read the book. It's worth renting not worth owning. Acting wasn't that great and plot was &#34;meh&#34;.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|It's an ok app. helps to pass a little time if i'm out somewhere and don't want to get too involved with serious reading or anything. Can get boring after a bit, but hey, it's free.
B00A12VW86|4.0|Been a Green Day fan since the mid 90's and I have been pretty disappointed with some of the later albums. American Idiot was wonderful, but their follow-up left a lot to be desired. Uno was... eh... with a couple of bright spots. Dos, on the other hand, is Green Day like I remember them from my teenage years. Lazy Bones is an excellent song. Looking forward to Tre when I get around to buying it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|anytime i need to see what the weather is like, anywhere in the world, at a moments notice. this app is great. it has everything. temps, 10 day outlook. hour by hour. dopplar radar. cloud radar. pollen counts. you name it. LOVE, love this app.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Love this book! Like all the people in the book,  have told everyone I know. I love the. Main people.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Enjoyed the story. Well written and kept my interest throughout. I would recommend this to my friends. The pace is good<br />.
0071762345|5.0|Thanks David for the awesome book.  I wrote a report on 'Likeable' for my Independent Study, a requirement for my MBA in marketing.  It was the only book report I have written that did not bore me to tears.  Now that I am out of school I will be harassing you with my resume.  Great book...your social media tactics made a ton of sense.  Have a \\"likeable\\" day!!!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I didn't know what to expect but as I'm a huge fan of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, I ordeded the DVD.  The movie starts out a little slow but in the end it comes together and leaves you with a smile on your face.  The DVD gives a good explanation of life in India.
B007X4ECLY|5.0|Great movie!  You may need to turn on the subtitles to understand the one crazy convict -- really strong Irish (I think) accent.  At the very least, make sure you have a good center-channel speaker to separate out vocals from background.<br />Guy Pearce gave a really great performance as a smart-alec action hero, and I enjoyed the little mystery woven into the storyline, too.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Very good but a little to much medical details that most people would not understand. I know why he wrote it this way so people would believe him.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|the item I ordered was the big bang theory box set and it was in Excellent condition, brand new as the description said it would be! It Came faster than I expected it to come!
B003PGNBO8|4.0|The series was very good.  Too bad it was cancelled.  People do not understand that it takes time to develop relationships for the characters in any movie or play.<br /><br />I do agree it was not as interesting as LOst.  But, then LOSt was filmed in the islands.  The story line was different and required the viewer to pay  attention.  The commercial ads do detract from the understanding of the story.  But, dvd improvies it immensley...
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this at the theater and knew I had to get the DVD.  Bradley Cooper shines as an autistic adult struggling to make sense of his life after being in an institution and losing his wife.  Robert De Niro was brilliant as Bradley's father displaying all the heartaches and emotion of having an autistic son yet standing behind him.  Jennifer Lawrence was a star in her role, with problems of her own, yet helping Bradley to have a more normal life by channeling his focus and energy on her and dance.  She won best supporting actress for her role.  It is a timely accurate film on the issues, confrontations and emotions of a family dealing with autism.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|We played the tutorial once and wanted to play it again.  Can't find it now we're not sure how to play it.  Where do we find help?  We'll keep looking.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|Great app. Easy to use. To all you geniuses out there downrating this app for your kindle fires, why screw the developers of a perfectly good app for a design flaw in your device? What do you want it to do, add an extra screen to the back of your device so you can see the scan?  Anyway, great app
B00C7O8TSM|1.0|It saddens me, as a life-long Beach Boys fan, that the group's 2012 50th Anniversary events have been so universally accepted and loved.  This album, as of the time I write this, had 17 5-star reviews, 4 4-star, and 1 3-star review.  I have to think that those logging such glowing fondness for this double live album are third or fourth generation Beach Boy fans, or casual listeners of the group.  I wonder, too, if anyone of those falling over each other to say how great this set is actually LISTENED to the CD.<br /><br />As soon as I loaded the CD and heard the lead vocal to Do It Again, I was in pain.  Mike Love's voice IS GONE.  I mean, sadly, embarrassingly gone.  Even between songs, he can hardly TALK, his voice is so thin and weak.  When a great painter can't paint anymore, he retires.  When a football player can't make a tackle or run anymore, he retires.  When an opera singer can't hit the notes anymore, he retires.  Yet, Mike not only gets a pass, everyone apparently ADORES his 72 year old \\"vocals.\\"  But I don't go after Mike due to his age.  Jimmy Buffett is 66, yet he can still deliver.  Ditto for 65 year old James Taylor.  But Mike has lost it.  And no one cares!  Adding to my suffering, the set list on the album is weighted heavily to Mike Love lead vocal songs.  But Mike isn't by far the only bad vibe on the record.<br /><br />I hear lots of background vocals on every song.  Yet, I can only pick out Al's, Brian's, and Bruce's vocals when they are singing leads.  It's as if the band is covering for them so that all the real Beach Boys have to do is sing their leads, then sit back and lip-synch backgrounds when it isn't their turn.<br /><br />As the lone 3-star reviewer pointed out, so much of this album is an illusion.  So much is studio tricks.  And for all the tools available to record producers today, they still can't make Mike sound acceptable, or make this sound like a *real* Beach Boys record.  Sad, sad, sad all the way around.<br /><br />No one isa bigger fan of the group than I.  But I have been a believer that had the group retired after their Keepin' The Summer Alive tour, their status today would be damn near equal to the Beatles, Led Zep, and the Stones.  They would be known for leaving while they were still on top of their game.  There would be no long, sorry decline.  No appearance of \\"we're just staying together for the money\\".<br /><br />If you want to hear the group live, firing on all cylinders, get the 1973 double live album.  Or the 1969 \\"Live in London.\\"  There are also lots of great bootleg Beach Boys concerts from the 60s and 70s.  In their prime, no one could touch them.  But in their prime, they had Carl Wilson, a musical talent and voice which no one can replace.<br /><br />The rest of you can keep drinking the Kool Aid.  I, for one, will not play this CD a second time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I'm left wanting to know more... good, easy read. Keeps you guessing throughout the entire novel.  Not what I expected.
0739352989|5.0|I would not have normally read anything like this, but glad that I did. As it progressed and I got over the shocks and got used to the email references, I began to become interested in the eventual outcome. Certainly, it was left in such a way that a continuation of the saga is possible.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I wasn't amazed by this book or anything. But it was definitely a cute love story. I wasn't able to put the book down, and it made me cry. Don't have anything to complain about.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|Silver Linings Playbook was my favorite movie of the year. It has romance, humor, education about mental illness, and it has a great soundtrack. I recommend this movie to all all adults (R ).<br /><br />The individuals disks themselves all worked well. I haven't watched any of the special features yet though.
8866131121|5.0|i work out of my car, and it's much easier for me to have my schedule in my hands than online or in a notepad in my phone.  this day planner was definitely the right choice.  super useful calendars in the front, plenty of space for all kinds of appointments or assignments for each individual day, and the tabbed section in the back makes a great address book.  the cover is durable and the ribbon bookmark and elastic band to keep it closed in your bag make this planner absolutely worth the money.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Works well with the Kindle. I like that I can stand it up, fold it back for reading & securely close it with the strap. The plastic holder snaps right on to the device with little effort and has great holding power. I would recommend this case for the price.
0385344333|1.0|I have more or less liked all previous Reacher novels, at times wondering how much of the technical stuff was made up, how much tested, how much factual.  For instance, in a much earlier novel, reacher was to do a russian roulette with a 357 magnum colt python revolver, and did so confidently.  did not shoot himself.  he later explained to the reader that one cartridge in the cylinder of this gun, which is superbly made, would always wind up at the 6 oclock position, where it would not fire, because the weight of the bullet and  the free turning of the cylinder would put the weight downhill so to speak.  I have this gun, tried it, and that is not true.  Reacher might have been dead with a few repetitions of this Lee Child fictional situation.  So, i can put up with some of that sort of thing and still enjoy it.<br /><br />But, this latest novel abuses the reader throughout.  Reacher does not do much of anything till somewhere past page 480.  The dull and meaningless and repetitive detail is just deadening.  He describes in detail every bland motel room he enters, and they are all the same.  For some unfathonable reason, about half way through this clunker, Reacher keeps a motel key.  Later on he tries to use it as a knife, cause traveling as he does, having a little pocket knofe just would not do.  The key does not work for a knife.  But wait, it has a burr on the end, and if this burr is carefully applied to the thing to be cut, one can just worry it apart, with enough time and pressure.  So, time after time he has cut something with this burr on the end of the key.  Cut plastic wall, cut bonds tying up someone, on and on in total absurdity.<br /><br />Other thing is his nose is bashed in throughout the book.  Lots of ink put on this nose thing,over and over.  This is as  tiresome as the key thing and the general boredom of the book.  I kept thinking this had to improve, but it never did.  Somehow even the action scene, at the very end, was boring.  A few other thing, he mentioned killing a squirrel at 400 feet with a .22 cartridge, rifle or pistol, i lost track.  A .22 will go that far, but no human being could manage to hit a squirrel with it.  Shot group for this cartridge varies from about 1.5 inches to 3 inches at 50 ydst, according to American Rifleman data published by the NRA.  The outside figure at 400 feet would be about an 8 inch shot group.<br /><br />All sorts of irrelevant detail, foremost among which is the population and area codes for lots of different cities.  Anyway, a complete critique of this ripoff would go on and on.  Child is riding on his previous reputation here and just junking it up.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. I have so many families and so much money saved up. Pretty awesome game!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie is beautifully written, brilliantly acted, and a treasure to have in my personal collection.  The mind is so very powerful that it has been proven capable of overriding even the worst of adversities, and this movie, based on an awesome true story, is intriguing in every respect.  It helped me to understand the hallucinations my own mother suffered with for years, and it was even recommended for viewing by a clinical psychologist whom I know.  All of the &#34;extras&#34; on the second disc are fascinating as well.  I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase!

B008TMA1LY|5.0|i love this game!! it works perfectly with kindle fire the graphics are clear, the characters are super cute, and it can be very addicting!!! it can be hard the higher level u are but its really fun if ur bored xD u should get it!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really short but so much fun!! You really have to put some focus into it if you wanna beat the room.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a very classic game nothing out of the ordinary though. I was hoping it would stand out from the rest but after a wail I just was not feeling it because there was nothing that special about it. I would give this 3 stars. It does its job but it’s nothing special.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well nothing to say but ...... I'M ADDICTED. If u think u will hate this think again it is the best game ever played. I watch ALL of those minecraft videos and have my own team. Hopefully soon my mom will let me have my own channel on YouTube for minecraft and animal jam. Anyways this is totally worth $6.99!!!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This is my favorite messenger by far. It has a good selection of emoticons; you can take pictures and add them. You can screen shot and have different groups along with one on one conversations and works great! Easy 5 stars from me!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|First half was exactly what I was hoping for and expecting but second half I kept waiting for it to return to the original writing style.<br />Although the second half was still interesting it was too quickly separated from the beginning story.<br />Still overall it contained brilliant use of history and realistic placements.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I saw a lot of people liked this game and saw great reviews but I found it a little boring. Yes it was addicting at first but then I thought, what am I really trying to get? Which is really nothing at all. I also think sometimes it seemed a little rigged because of how the coins would go. This game was a one day wonder for me, so it got 2 stars from me.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have this on my phone and now on my kindle. On my problem I've had is friend codes do not work. Should also be able to &quot;find&quot; the keys to open rooms.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|This game is so cute and fun I love singing into it and playing. I also have found my cats love it when I meow into it and then he mocks it back. They will come running to where I am. Great idea! 5 stars. No flaws really for what it is.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Les Miserables is a beautiful film with a touching story that tears you up. All of the singing is wonderful and the cast really puts emotion into the lyrics that demands your attention. It's something you want to watch over and over again.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|Sheldon makes me day brighter. Penny mocks him and it provided me with so much entertainment that I would recommend it to other friends.
B0015XASFS|1.0|Was not aware most of the songs were in Italian!! Would like to exchange for another CD/DVD or other merchandise!!! Maybe I will be more diligent in review a CD before purchasing.

B009LMTDL0|5.0|I always considered myself a strong confident woman who went after the things she wanted! Having read this book, I realised that I've held myself back in so many ways without knowing it.<br /><br />My one wish is that the author had spent some time exploring how women sabotage each other in the work place & discussed how to counteract the espionage or in some cases, terrorism! Sheryl Sandberg has been either very lucky to have had the support she describes or has chosen not to talk about her experiences..... and I bet there were many. The onslaught of criticism that she received when this book was published, is proof positive of that!<br /><br />Unless we as women learn to control the green eyed monster that lives in all of us, and learn to be supportive of our sisters in all their endeavours, then the concept of &#34;leaning in&#34; is going to be a hard fought battle with enemies both outside of the struggle and within. That being said, I really enjoyed the book & have recommended it to many of my friends.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Can product evolution improve the breed? That was my question when the new Plantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth headset appeared here on Amazon. But that same question can be asked about the accessories.<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B009UNGYHG Plantronics Voyager Legend Charge Case]] represents a clever and innovative way to not just protect the Voyager Legend Bluetooth headset, but packing additional features into the case goes a long way towards increasing its overall value.

Have been using my Voyager Legend headset constantly since September of 2012, and had waited for this accessory to arrive for months. It turned out to be even better than expected, and for a number of reasons.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I had been the satisfied owner of a [[ASIN:B0043EV20G Voyager PRO+]] headset, and had purchased the [[ASIN:B002QKZLZ6 Plantronics Carry Case for Voyager Pro/Pro+ Bluetooth Headset]] to protect it. While on an extended bike ride that summer, it was lost with the headset due to the weak and substandard belt clip, a problem that others had also experienced. As a result, I had to order another new Plantronics Voyager PRO+ headset.<br /><br />To say that this new case with its internal battery is evolutionary is an understatement. It's not only a well-crafted and handy way to store the Voyager Legend headset, it is quite multi-functional in it's ability to add additional hours of talk time. The LED indicators display the battery charge status of both the headset and the case at a quick glance. When they're blue, you're good to go.<br /><br />◆ Bottom Line:<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B009UNGYHG Plantronics Voyager Legend Charge Case]] is one of those products that proves than manufacturers can and do listen to the needs of the users.

B00BV2M9LO|1.0|This is a great disappointment.  The basic science is flawed, a thing that Michael Chrichton would no have allowed. E.G. One of the protagonists (it is sort of tag-teamed as there is a good deal of mayhem in the story) talks about his autonomic nervous system compared to his sympathetic (one is a part of the other).  The whole problem of failure to conserve mass is ignored but somehow the magic magnets just make things small.  an interesting idea wasted.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Classic movie about the history of bodybuilding.  It is a documentary, not a training video.  All guys should see this!
B000002ADT|5.0|How i missed this beautiful, yearning, soul-felt music for so many years is a mystery, but now i have it and i play it often.  It's my go-to choice when i want that deep comfort in times of stress.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I definitely loved the movie.<br />Christoper Nolan is a spectacular writer, producer, and director.<br />Pretty much anything he puts out is worth watching.<br />Great visuals, beautiful environments, great dialogue, pretty solid.<br /><br />Not a con, but the viewer has to relinquish his beliefs of what the joker is as far as what is depicted in the comic books.<br />I prefer what the joker is in the comic books, but nolan definitely pulled off this psychopathic, chaos-riddened individual.<br /><br />Definitely a movie to be watched by all.
B00AWE9TCE|5.0|My seven-year-old grandson had stars in his eyes when he opened this gift.  His joy was palpable, and so was mine.  In just a few hours he had assembled it and sent a picture of it to me, glowing with pride as he held it close and described how he loves the pod.  I couldn't be happier with this choice for this young boy.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The high definition brought to these classic films is impeccable.<br />The colors are great and the sound is superior.<br />The first two movies were particularly 'dark' in color, I feel that the restoration greatly enhanced the vibrancy of the picture.<br /><br />And anybody who hasn't seen the godfather, go watch them now.. no excuses.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Good reading! I enjoyed the book very much and the twist and turns of the mystery. Loking forward to reading the rest in the series.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|I loved this movie when I first went to see it in the theater and I like it even more now that I have my own copy to watch it when ever I want
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follett's longer books e.g. Pillars of the Earth are perfect vacation books.  This one fit the bill.  What a pleasure spending hours at a time getting to know these characters, real and imagined.
B008MM9630|5.0|I wish there were a 100 star rating cause that's what I'd rate it. I love this game so much. It's so fun! And addictive.
098555780X|4.0|This book helps me with ideas for making more paracord items.<br />I will use it for other ideas & learning new knots.<br />Thank you.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have two grandaughters one 4 years old and the other one 10 years old and they both love the game.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Was a little slow for me in the beginning but picked up speed the further I got into it.  Extremely good planning on the villainous character. Many twists because this person was so conniving and sly....truly evil.  Only thing I didn't like was the ending which didn't do it for me at all. I was disappointed that this bad seed did not truly get \\"what goes around comes around\\".
B0064W667Y|5.0|Normally not a fan of graphic novels but it was awesome.  Really enjoyed it. Can't wait for the game to come out.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|Great movie. if I could give more stars I would. I'm seeing more of Josh Brolin's work , he is  a good actor, and I've always love Ryan Gosling. Sean Penn did an excellent job as Mickey Cohen (not surprised). This one was a winner from start to finish.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|......mmmmm should be XXX rated as the first moments of visual female anatomy leaves nothing to the imagination. These scenes could have been left out as they held little value to the whole plot.  To show the pilot as a womanizer could have been done w/o the nudity. The story line is good & there is a lot of human failings that are shown and can be overcome with honesty & grace.  Flying a commercial airliner upside down with the hydraulic controls not functioning is a bit of a stretch.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Iliked  it because Im a sifi fan I would recommend it for older kids mainly because of the violence which i know isnt as bad as some
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This a great suspense movie.  Held my attention the entire movie & can see why it was an Academy Award winner.
B0000DZ3EA|3.0|I'm giving this three stars, not due to any problem with the music that is here, but just because I think you are shortchanging yourself if you stick only to this. Peter Gabriel is one of a select few artists who bring a completely unique sound to rock music. While he has enjoyed some chart success (mostly before my time, so I don't know how much of a household name he may have been at his peak), he is not one of those artists who by some happy chance manage to pen a few hits but otherwise turn out a slew of generic pop/rock numbers. He didn't rely on a particular sound which got rehashed for thirty years. Every song on every album has a raison d'etre, each is a meticulously crafted artistic statement existing in its own fully fleshed out context. Not every song is a catchy up-tempo pop song but that's because Peter Gabriel's music runs the gamut of human emotions from loneliness, alienation and grief to romance and occasionally even goofiness. I guess if you're a stereotype from a teen drama you may not relate to a lot of this but if you have normal human emotions there is a lot offered by Peter Gabriel's music beyond the limited sampling available in a compilation like this. I guarantee that there are songs on each of his albums that didn't make it onto this compilation which will blow your mind, stun you with their sheer beauty or even change your life. If you're just trying to recapture the soundtrack of those heady high school days back in '85, I'd like to gently suggest that you're missing the point of this music. By all means go download a $0.99 mp3 of the Safety Dance, but Peter Gabriel's work is rewarding on many more levels.  If you care to hear my opinion I would recommend starting with the album [[ASIN:B008V59AF2 So (25th Anniversary Remaster)]] (which is basically a greatest hits album itself) and then [[ASIN:B003ZZAXFO Peter Gabriel 3: Melt]] and [[ASIN:B00006F7S3 Up]]. But get all his albums eventually. And once you have all the albums, what would bethe point of having this compilation?
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|I loved this game so much I am playing it for the second time. I think k the graphics are great nd it is a fun game!  I wish they would come out with #2.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|In The Phoenix Project, Bill gets thrown into the fire and has to save the company from complete failure.  The IT department is in complete disarray, with every project missing deadlines and going over budget.  I was able to really feel the pressure Bill was under while reading the book and I wanted to keep reading to see how it was going to turn out.<br /><br />I thought that the authors did an excellent job blending the story with IT methodology and best practices for management.  All the characters were great.  They were very believable and I'm pretty sure I've worked with a few of them (LOL).  Although, as a piece of fictional work, I merely found it okay.  The writing was a little weak and the conversations mostly felt forced and unnatural.<br /><br />Being someone who works in this industry, I really enjoyed it.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has either worked in IT/Development or just has an interest in it.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The more you play the more fun it becomes. Upgrading the vehicles adds a whole new level of fun. Highly recommended.
B001CZJKS0|4.0|I LOVE this series, however, the fact that it did not include Part 2, and I had to buy that separately, really bugged me. Why did you not include Part II?! If it weren't for the freaky little Myers cat mask they include (seriously, it is so freakin' small and looks so awesome on a cats face running around, hahaha!), I would have burned the entire set and laughed as I lay there crying.

0380715430|5.0|A great introduction to the study of the English language through linguistics and etymology. The title, &#34;English, and How it Got That Way&#34; is as accurate as can be.  Almost everyone is aware of the Germanic origins of English, and the Classical Latin and Greek influences, but other influences- Turkish, Indian, Celtic, etc- are covered and made clear.  Although Gaelic was spoken throughout the British Isles, prior to the Roman conquest in the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, shockingly little of it remains in modern spoken English, and Bryson tells us why.  This and other fascinating bits of information await the reader, and all is presented in a very accessible, and approachable manner.  Academics may find some details and specifics wanting, but for the armchair etymologist, this book is a must-read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is challenging and fun. Simple enough for just about anyone to pick up and play.  It looks good and runs well on the Kindle Fire HD.

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Through the years I've read a number of books on change. The fundamental base of most of them is that if you just do x, y, and z change is easy! The Heath brothers make no such false promises. They never say change is easy, but they do provide a clear pattern to follow if you want the best chance of successful change. It is interesting and practical. If you are looking for a good summary framework to lead a change, then this book is a great place to start.
B0000025KI|5.0|this is exactly what my husband was looking for, i don't know what else to say other than he is very satisfied!!!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Exceptionally well written and revealing look into how Presidents operate, think and interact with each other.  I was very surprised at the relationships and unlikely allies.  This book perfectly illustrates the difference between our publicized media view of politics and the lifelong relationships that make our governing system actually function, warts and all.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am so glad that I did not buy this book, and I am surprised at all the five stars that it got.  I guess those who gave it a five star have never read a good book worthy of five stars or four stars for that matter.<br /><br />First off, I could not wait to finish the book.  Usually, if it is a good book, one does not wish it to come to an end.  There was no problem on that score.  Secondly, I could not get into Christian.  If the author thinks by keep having to tell the readers how attractive he is, how much money he has and the toys that he has in order for us to connect with Christian and think him sexy and powerful, she is sadly mistaken.  If he  \\"smirked\\" one more time, I was going to scream.  That alone makes me not being able to connect with someone who smirks all of the time.  I guess the author never heard the saying \\"I would like to wipe that smirk right off your face.\\"  She tried to create sophistication in this 26-year-old young man but it did not work, and if she thought by having Christian pull out Ana's tampon would do the trick....well that is another issue.  What was she thinking. Both he and Ana seemed immature, and I was wondering how old the author was and/or her research on BDSM, besides the fact that this book is supposed to be erotic/BDSM, yet the only hard-core sexual word  she used was the \\"F\\" word.  \\"Down there\\" and \\"inner Goddess\\" does not fit in with a supposedly steamy and erotic book.  As far as the sex scenes, they were not that erotic but then again, Ana did not seem to have trouble having the umteen orgasims! If the wind blew, look out.  My vagina was not even interested in the \\"sex\\" scenes! It got to be boring and I actually skimmed.  I cannot believe that they are thinking of making a movie out of this.  Perhaps the screenwriters will make it better.  They can do nothing to harm it.<br /><br />I have read J. Kenner's \\"Release Me\\" and \\"Claim Me\\" wherein comments were made that her books were just another version of 50 Shades book. Ihave to definitely disagree. In fact, it is because that I read Ms. Jenner's two books (third coming out the end of July) first, that I could not get into 50 Shades.  Ms. Kenner's hero, Damien Stark, comes across as very powerful, mature and very sensual. There was no skimming the steamy scenes.  I really could not see him caring a wit if his mother showed up at his house.  Damien was opened about his sexual preferences wherein Christian wanted to keep it silent.  And one cannot really compare Nikki with Ana, and speaking of Ana, if I were Ana, a virgin, and was told that I could not tell anyone about my lover's sexual style of life, then that certainly is a warning sign and I would go running for the hills.<br /><br />Now, I have to decide, as I bite my lower lip, whether to read 2 and 3 of this series. Jeez, I guess I will give book 2 a try.  Perhaps the author read some of the three-star reviews and lower and learned from it.  If not, I will not be reading book 3.  Too many good books out there to read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good way to pass time. Response is better than original version, but I'm also playing on a larger screen. Enjoyable.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|This remains my favorite Stallone film.<br /><br />It's got everything - lots of action, a love interest, hey it's even got Bill and Ted!<br /><br />Granted, the plot feels  pretty calculated - the  thrills march along one after another and don't miss a beat.  Yep, this is an action film with almost no dull moments.  Watching \\"Cliffhanger\\" will not do you any favors if you are acrophobic!<br /><br />And  you've also got to hand it to Lithgow, who's equally convincing whether he plays a good guy, or a bad guy (he's a particularly cold-hearted bad guy in this one).<br /><br />Looks like all of the Special Edition DVD features were ported over to this Blu Ray, and the picture quality itself is a marked improvement.<br /><br />Definitely worth $8.00!
0525478817|5.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />This book was amazing, it made me laugh, it made me cry.<br />The novel is amazing, the ending was so sad though especially when Augustus  had a pre-funeral and then when he(WARNING SPOILERS ahead) dies.....:(. I cried at the end. It was such a powerful ending though. This isn't like other romance novels I read, it has a lot more real emotion put into it. Some people have been calling it twilight with cancer but personally I think it is nothing like Twilight. Twilight is about a love triangle between Bella, Jacob and Edward, a paranormal romance novel about a girl who acts weak and relies on her sparkly vampire boyfriend(husband)Twilight is completely different, The fault in Our stars is a lot less predictable and more short and sweet. I highly reccomend this novel, they already have announced that they are casting for the movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel and Ansel Elgort will be Agustus.

Once you crack open Defending Jacob, it becomes quite difficult to put down because it's full of page-turning twists!<br /><br />I have always liked mysteries -- the first ones I remember reading were Agatha Christie novels. This book takes a step in a different direction. Defending Jacob is a mystery wrapped in a legal thriller. The author, William Landay, has experience with the law as a graduate of Boston College Law School and a former Assistant District Attorney. This really comes through as you're reading the book; you get a sense that Landay has an intimate knowledge of the subject matter as he explains legal terms in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. It doesn't feel forced. Landay's writing is as accessible as a John Grisham novel.<br /><br />The story is told as a first-person narrative from the perspective of Andy Barber, father to Jacob and first District Attorney in the small town of Newton, Massachusetts. After a local boy is found murdered, finger pointing begins and the Barber family is caught in the cross hairs. The novel follows their struggles as their son, Jacob, is accused of murder. It's about making difficult choices, what we chose to include in our realities, and the importance of family.<br /><br />Defending Jacob's strengths are the strong voice and guidance of the narrator coupled with a compelling story that always keeps you second guessing. At the beginning, Andy Barber cozies right up next to you and becomes your new best friend. He expertly navigates you through interactions with the community, the police, the courts, and his family. But when doubt creeps into Andy's mind, it creeps into yours, too.<br /><br />There were some problems with the book -- one of which was Jacob's mother Laurie and how she was written. She was very one-dimensional, something I wasn't expecting from a small family unit facing adversity. I don't want to outline any more because then I'd just be getting nit-picky and end up spoiling the book. The less you know when you start, the better!<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />Library Bag. Overall this was an engaging read. I'd recommend borrowing it from the library if you're looking for something suspenseful this summer.<br /><br />This review was originally posted here: http://cwatc-bookclub.blogspot.com/2013/05/bookshelf-library-bag-or-donation-box_31.htmlunit facing adversity.

B00A50PETW|5.0|This is a great cd and it sounds even better on record, i am very happy with this fantastic product.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAS A CLASSIC STORY LINE THAT ANY ONE WHO LIKES THIS TYPE OF MOVIE WOULD LOVE.<br />GREAT DRAMA AND ACTION PACKED.
B003ZHQVJ4|5.0|This is a great cd and it sounds even better on record, i am very happy with this fantastic product.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|Its a rare occasion I give such a rating for anything but this books biggest problem is not paying close enough details when written. Ending up with a book that was very unrealistic and having some big flaws.  For example Garth locks his door from the inside to talk to the person who had just attacked the king.  Shortly after, a guard bursts into the room and announces the attack on the king not noticing the person with him covered in blood.  The other problems were just grammatical though I just consider that an annoyance.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I love Jakob and Josh Lombard. The first of all the pirates are not allowed to be able to get to Bloomington Minnesota from staples Minnesota to the wild woods.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|this game is really fun and has great graphics and the enemies are no push overs. this is another great game by gameloft
B0053O89KG|4.0|To all the ones that already bought the full season.. Would you mind to take a look and find out if it has a subtitle option, for example, Spanish?<br />Many thanks,<br />Marce
B004XJNPAQ|4.0|This is a violent gory romp,it is explicit and over the top but a whole lot of fun. The best character is the accountant and just to watch him would make the movie but the fast cars and pretty women sure do not hurt
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Sometimes movies about relationships can be predictable and corny- this movie however is quite the opposite.  Loved De Niro's character and Bradley Cooper was extraordinary playing the role of a person with severe mental illness (that can be tough to pull off).  This movie will make you laugh and does a silver lining in the end.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Its the best. Quality on blu-ray is excellent and to get all 3 in just one, its great.<br />Especially for the price that amazon is selling it for!<br />Nothing else to say but George Lucas is a genius.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The good stuff:  The actors were cast well, the story is wonderful and the underlying themes are thought provoking.  The bad things: This movie should have been made into 2 movies (or even a trilogy)- 3 hours for one movie was a lot to digest.  They also jumped around in the story instead of telling it linearly. Other than that it is a great movie with lots of twists and turns- including a beautiful love story.

1603427244|5.0|This book is fantastic!  I have not only referred to it several times, but have recommended it to my fellow knitters as well.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game but not long enough graphics very good story line good and not to expensive look forward to more games like this
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I like that I can take a picture and save it as a pdf. Will work greatly in my line of business. Works just like it says it will.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a fun and interactive game and I enjoy playing it and so dose my sister she is on it all the time.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Looking at reviews I've written in the past, came across this - I realized...this book was so disappointing and so disrespectful to her characters, and her readers...I haven't read one of her books since...it doesn't interest me. I don't trust her, and I actually made note of that in my original review - not as in &#34;she hurt my feelings.&#34; but - as a reader, I don't trust her to remain faithful to her own canon....Lowering the stars I gave this originally.  life by attrition, that's what happened to sookie. my review has SPOILERS.  I fully realize that envisioning and realizing a life ahead for Sookie with Eric is a definite challenge but I, and I suspect others, feel so let down and lead astray by Charlaine Harris that I question whether or not I can trust enough to read her future work. The effort she put into having us believe in the relationship between Eric and Sookie - with all it's problems - only to write him out of the picture in the way she did, is incredibly disappointing.  It is not that I don't like Sam, I have always (setting aside his horrific choice in women) liked him and appreciate the care and support he has extended to Sookie over the years. But he was never, and particularly in this way, the man to whom I would have paired Sookie with as the penultimate conclusion of the series. Sookie is worth so much more than a relationship by default.  shame on you Ms. Harris., shame....
B00CE379IM|3.0|Well didn't really care for the movie ,I read the novels and can say watching the movie left me confused ,why they didn't follow the book version .Even left my husband wondering what was going on and asking me a bunch of questions during the movie .I think the producers could of done better. But I would rate the novels five stars . Loved all four of them!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it but its 2 much 4 the kindle fire its like 6.99!!!! I have no idea why its like this because at first it was free then its like this
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I have not seen this movie yet because of a stupid problem with my right foot. If it is anything like it was on TV, I know I will enjoy it completely. I think Will Smith & Tommy Lee Jones did such a good job in the one I saw that I honestly don't think anyone else could do a better job.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I enjoyed, as always, reading about Sookie's adventures but was sadden because apparently this was the last installment in her adventures-I am hoping it isn't but because there wasn't a note at the end of the book showing the next installment I have to assume it was-it just seems there should be more to come especially now that she has hooked up with Sam-maybe pregnancy, a special child-or Eric coming back into her life-if it is the end I am sad because I totally enjoyed getting inside these novels-maybe Ms. Harris has some other wonderful fantasy books coming out-will keep checking
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I definately have not seen this movie simply because of a stupid problem with my right foot. As soon as I get out of rehab, I plan on watching every movie I have not been able to watch. That includes this movie.
1419707671|5.0|the granddaughter can hardly put the books down..<br /><br />I don't like having to write more than I want to on this survey!!!!!!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I definately have not had the opportunity to watch the DVD because of a stupid problem with my right foot but as soon as I can, I am definatly going to watch the movie. Especially since it looks like the one I watched on TV.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|why would you want it. it may be fun for little kids but its kind of pointless. its not at all good if you want a horse and cant have one. you cant physically ride her. she cant have babies. its ok if your bored but not really entertaining. you do the same thing over and over again. not at all like a real horse.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I have not been able to watch this movie yet because of a stupid problem in my right foot. But if it is anything like the one I saw on TV, I know I will enjoy the movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I can't figure it out. I'm stuck. The clues are vague and the strippers are pretty. Check it put. Check Ch cha church
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I was able to watch most of the movie. The reason why I did not watch the entire movie is due to the fact I went to sleep about half way through. What little I did see, I really did like an awful lot. I just hope the next time I watch it, I hope I can stay awake for the whole movie.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This is the best battery app I've found to date for my Galaxy S III. My only reason for not rating it a 5 is that the notification can be a bit quirky. Otherwise, it works great!
B000GFLEB8|5.0|I was not able to watch the movie because my stupid machine won't play HD movies. So I had to send back the movie.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It is easy enough yet still keeps you interested. The fish are pretty cute, too. So many other fish games make it difficult or impossible to get fish and accessories but this one has you play games to get them. There is nothing more frustrating than having to buy all the time but this game takes care of that for you. It is good for all levels of play. It works great on my Kindle fire, so that's a big plus, too. I definitely recommend it.
B000E5KJHA|5.0|I was not able to watch the dvd simply because my stupid machine does not play HD movies. So as a result, I had to send back the  movie.
B000M341QE|5.0|Definite glorification of the bad guys, especially Jack Nicholson, who shares Scarface's affinity for cocaine and violence. Love Dicaprio's character. Would've have liked to have seen more on the Mark Whalberg character, and the ending is dark and leaves with you an empty feeling---like there was the potential to be moved emotionally, but as frequently happens in Scorcese movies, the inevitable destruction of many of the characters portrayal is more important than the potential for eliciting emotion.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I have not had a chance to see any of the movies because of a stupid problem in my right foot. If any of the movies are anything like the ones I saw on VHS, I know I will enjoy the movies completely.
B00012FXAE|5.0|Sigourney Weaver, while not my favorite actress, really comes through in this movie. The extra time added in this edition make it a better overall movie, though everyone may not agree with me. If a movie is defined by its villains, this one has some terribly bad-ass ones, and although this is science fiction/horror, it has the gritty realism and visceral quality of a war movie. It certainly has enough ammo expended in it as any war flick. But unlike the more recent &#34;Battle Los Angeles&#34; instead of a cheesy plot line w/ cheesy two-dimensional characters, we have more 3dimensional characters. Bill Paxton is just awesome and hilarious as the scared little private who gauges, unlike many other overly confident soldiers, just how dangerous the creatures really are.<br /><br />Love this movie, has excellent replay value---in addition to purchasing, have seen it many times on television, each time just as enjoyable. Only regret is that I was a kid when it came out in the theater (I think). In any event, would've loved to see on the big screen.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have yet to see all these films simply because of a stupid problem on my right foot. As soon as I can, I'm definately going to watch all of my unwatched  movies I have.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Admittedly I am biased in favor of Star Trek, but the overly critical reviews of the so-called movie experts are unwarranted. This movie is suspenseful, and sad. It has an elegaic, quiet quality to it, and the music blends seamlessly with the movie. It's focused on Picard and Data, but their on-screen friendship has always been interesting to explore. Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Incredibly confortable!!.  I have read several books on this theme.  But, a testimony comming from a neurosurgeon of the caliber of Eben Alexander I feel  enthusiastic of that transit from the current life  to the eternal life as promised by our lord Jesuscrist,  and the encounter with GOD.
0807014273|5.0|I gave this book to my graduating grandchildren.  The basic message is you will have little control of many of things which happen to you in life.  The real test is how you handle what happens
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|As background I am almost 60, a die hard AC/DC fan, I like the Rolling Stones and I never listened to much Alice in Chains before.<br /><br />Amazon recommended this album to me and I am so glad because it is really ROCKING, excellent guitar work, harmonies, strong drumming, just a beautiful creation.<br /><br />I LOVE this stuff. Of course now I will be exploring the Alice in Chains back catalogue. Yeah! Rock and Roll is alive and well!!
0810993139|5.0|I buy these books for my eight year old grandson and he loves them.  When I purchased him first one, he was not to thrilled with what he calls chapter books, but after his first Wimpy Kid book, he was hooked. He now has whole set and is waiting for the new one.
0465022227|5.0|As a graduating PhD student considering a career in academia I found this book invaluable.<br />It reads very pleasantly and has loads of very useful and practical considerations.<br />Regardless what you current position in academia might be, I highly recommend this book.
B008OM0EDO|5.0|It's easy to misunderstand satire when its wrapped up in vulgar comedic form. And those who didn't watch it to the end and said its bad? Well you guys missed out on the important key message when Aladeen addresses the U.N. about the perks of a dictatorship. If nothing else, watch that scene. The dictator isn't really about an evil dictator, it's actually an ironic statement about the state of America: of corruption, corporatism, and greed. But its guised as trash and it is trash, but as the final scene would suggest, the nasty things happening behind closed doors in the U.S. is even below this trash. A darker understanding the director aimed to produce is that while our dictator in the story is a joke and a spoiled imbecile, real problems in this country aren't laughing matter. And when an \\"awful dictator\\" is depicted as the last hope of a \\"real\\" democracy (*there's a funny plot twist spoiler*), it suggests that democracy has died already and is only a facade for the greedy to mobilize people and manipulate them.<br /><br />*spoiler: in the end a democracy is brought forth with open elections - a tank pushes voters towards Aladeen's booth. In reality, nothing has changed. It is still a dictatorship under the guise of a democracy. My comments: But at least here it is ridiculously obvious of how people are being manipulated... but the same cannot be said for people who are so subtly manipulated, people don't even know they're being manipulated. We let laws, such as the Patriot Act which basically lets the government detain anybody for an indefinite amount of time if suspected of terrorism, pass. It brings into mind a scene where Aladeen talks to Nadal on the bridge about civil rights in passing. (Aladeen: \\"civil rights? what are those Nadal?\\" \\"I'll tell you about it, it's a hilarious joke\\").<br /><br />To be fair, as some of the 1 star votes have indicated, the vulgarity is highly inappropriate and offensive to everyone. And I mean everybody! Some people may have a problem with that but here's what you're missing - it's supposed to poke fun at everyone more or less 'equally' regardless of class, race, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, and religion. But search deeper. Note the way how Aladeen's offensiveness remarks contrasts with those of Clayton in the beginning where he basically says \\"hell, if you aint from the U.S., everyone of you is an A-rab\\". There is no distinction or shades of grey in this symbolic \\"patriotic\\" man's mind. He does not see the differences in cultures and people and simply lumps everyone either as \\"one of us\\" or \\"the enemy\\" - a mentality borne of fear, persecution, and dehumanization. In contrast, Aladeen takes the time to insult everybody personally but he at least recognizes people according to what they identify themselves as and offends PEOPLE rather than just seeing an amorphous blob of enemies everywhere as Clayton does.<br /><br />I'll leave off this long and boring commentary with this single summary of the Dictator:<br />\\"A man, even an awful dictator, can have a change of heart, but a company (even if the government suggest otherwise) is not a man.\\"
1623420148|5.0|Hilarious and witty! I loved that it was in the guy's POV - and trust me, he's not some sweet, caring, loving guy.  He's a GUY, a REAL guy!!  He says things and thinks things that sound so much like a real guy, it's hilarious!  Just read some of the quotes from the book and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
B00A7W29BE|5.0|I was skeptical at first. I was worried that this would just be a camera app with a PDF export but it actually offers a lot more. My tablet only has a 5 mega pixel camera but it still shows results. If you ever need to &quot;scan&quot; documents on the go I highly recommend this. It works great and is incredibly easy to use!
1439102813|4.0|My grandmother had Alzheimer's, so this book really hit close to home. It was a little hard to read in parts, or I guess I should say, hard to think about, but I'm glad I read it. I had a long discussion with my mother and sister afterward.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Had trouble staying focused on movie, once focused, noticed the horse trading gong on, seemed too much like today's politics or at least a metaphor for how it should be done in our current political theatre. At that point it seemed a dummying down of Lincoln. Acting of Lincoln was superb, His wife Mary also was supremely done.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|I have always loved this movie, especially when I was growing up. It's a timeless classic that makes even my younger siblings, who are six and eight, laugh! You can easily ignore the slightly poor quality that comes from a movie from that era as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang ensnares you into its grasp!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Definitely a good game and worth the money.  The graphics are phenomenal and the gameplay itself is very smooth, so to speak.  It is challenging enough to hold my interest and there are always hints and a strategy guide if you are really stuck.  I absolutely recommend this game.  I played it on the kindle fire and had no problems whatsoever. : )
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling is one of my all time favorite authors, and is high up on the pedestal next to Edgar Allen Poe and J.R.R. Tolkien. This new book of hers is definitely an adult book, but nothing to graphic at all! It's an interesting read.<br /><br />Though, there is one thing that I noticed about this book; J.K. Rowling has a thing for names that end in '-arry'. 'Harry' 'Barry' 'Mary'...you get my point ;)
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|This was a book that I really enjoy. I hardly ever read and for some reason I saw this book, got it on my Kindle, and instantly I was hooked. If you like a good book with adventure and action this is the book for you!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This is a really fun game. You get to move around too. Definitely 5 stars. I hope you like this game as much as i do.
1449433251|5.0|I love it, the complete Calvin and Hobbs... a must have for anybody who loves Calvin and Hobbs.<br />It is great.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Seems to be a fairly faithful re-creation of the novel.  Well casted. My only complaint was the lack of faithfulness to the dialogue.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Must read for any fan of heros, comic or otherwise. Alan Moore took the silver age of comics and destroyed any notion of familiarity.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game has a lot of realistic detail and really challenges your brain. Just simply in a word amazing. I hope they make ally more of these kind of games
0345803485|2.0|This book was nothing like I thought it would be. It was a fast read but not worth the time. Its your typical mondern day romance novel.which would be good, if that's what you were looking for.
B00004Y390|5.0|Lush and wonderful to listen to.  Lp's are heavy and quiet with no distracting background noise.  Glad I made this purchase and I know I will enjoy it for many years to come.
B00BY8DNK6|2.0|I've been a DIO fan for so many years. Sacred Heart has always been one of my favorite albums. I was so excited to see this full show come out and bought it. Ronnie sounds amazing as always. The band is killer. But the sound quality is unacceptable. OVER COMPRESSED and I hear a lot of white noise and clear distortion points. I'm betting the DVD sounds far better. But I haven't heard it yet.<br /><br />Sad that this great show was documented only to be ruined by post production. Not respectful to DIO, his band or the fans. I would rate this album near unlistenable. I hope the label will consider putting this great show out again with better mastering.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Jack Reacher never fail his reader,lee child know just how far to take you..This book is just as good as all the other ones in the series...
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I can't put this book down. It's one if those books that makes you feel like your there and get really involved in. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants  a book they can't put down.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|A very original story with surprises as only Sanderson can deliver.I couldn't put it down and because of the size of it I almost didn't have to.
B00CW665VI|3.0|I just didn't care for this book.  Didn't like the first person.  I wasn't sold on Drew going from a who're to love overnight.  Yes, there were some good parts but I just felt like something was missing.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This app is AWESOME!!!!!! My friend and I have a blast playing it every day. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!<br />I just love everything about it
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I just wish it was longer.  It was a good first game and i look forward to the next one.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Another good read with many unexpected twists and turns.  Cant wait for the next one Recommend to all Castle fans.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum are truly remarkable in this. The story line remains original and classic but I feel that Rossum and Butler work beautifully together to provide a masterpiece.
B0073COMKW|4.0|I got this bulb because of the price and I think LEDs are a good investment. I have this currently in the same room with some CFLs and the color temperature matches pretty well. So far I have no complaints. I believe I will be using these for any of my household bulb needs in the future as I prefer it to the compact florescent bulbs. The only property that is yet to be seen longevity.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love this game.  Just enough of a challenge to keep you going, but not too difficult that you would get frustrated.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|A great cartoon character  movie, enjoyed by three generations of our family: Eight and ten year old girls (going on 25), a sophisticated young adult, and a grandparent.  Charming characters, a heart warming story line, and of course, a happy ending.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This is a good movie worth watching.  It is a great story with a wonderful message.  It will leave you inspired.
B0094K1PW4|2.0|I guess someone, somewhere may like this movie, but it was totally underwhelming.  Save your time for something much more worthwhile.
B002O3Z50G|5.0|A great movie that I enjoy watching in the spring. It's a seasonal thing. Much better than watching the cut version on re-run.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom keifer put out a good first solo album, this is a must pick up if you a Cinderella Fan
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Thirteen Reasons Why makes you take another look at your life, others lives, and the roles every person places whether realizing it or not.
B005LAIII0|4.0|This was very interesting and I probably will watch it a few more times to catch more detail. The cinematography was spectacular.<br />I am not sure I liked the ending but each person has to decide.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game, only problem is I can't stop playing it. I would rate it ten stars if that was an option.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. I don't usually like musicals but this was wonderful. I was especially impressed by the voices of the various stars that have not performed in musicals before or at least not at this level of fame.
159315724X|5.0|I have always enjoyed success magazine so when I heard Darren Hardy had a book out I had to get it. It has open my thoughts on so many things I look forward to this new chapter in my life.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Finally a movie that captures the true meaning of what a &#34;movie for the whole family is&#34;. This movie has something for all ages and underneath all the captivating moments there is a subtle message and life lesson being taught.  &#34;Life of Pi&#34; is pure artistry and every film maker should strive to reach the same high standards.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|This, along with TDKR and the Hobbit, were the best movies of 2012. The current subject of examination: Prometheus. Ridley Scott doesn't simply try to make an \\"Alien prequel\\", rather he seeks to show us a universe from which the xenomorphs originated. There's a bit of Indiana Jones with exploration of caves and hieroglyphic markings. Very intelligent; thus this is NOT for the \\"Alien vs Predator\\" crowd.
032147404X|5.0|I would recommend this book for anyone just learning photography or those that need a refresher. Easy to navigate and comprehend.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Being a Gleek, I already love the talented Christopher Colfer, and he has written before, (Look for The Land of Stories) I know he's a genius! Chris baby you are an excellent writer!
B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I bought this because it was on sale and impulse.  I had recorded all movies on my DVD recorder but these are cleaner copies.  Someday I will have time to sit down and watch them.
0800141660|5.0|This is just an excellent movie for any Jane Austen fan. Great director & cast, excellent award winning script & true to the book, which I have read. My DVD arrived quickly after I placed my order & in excellent condition. The usual bubble wrap packaging was perfect to protect the DVD while in shipping. I would highly recommend to any Jane Austen fan!
B009FRG8IW|5.0|All the tracks are very well put together with a perfect blend of lyrics. Great music keeps you loving it till the end!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|This movie was so much more then either my wife or I expected. I have loaned it to my daughters and they love it as well.<br />I know a person who had the same problems as the main character had but she didn't find her mate.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Works fine every time, never had a problem with a Sony memory card in my life. Don't get the 64 MB models. What's too good to be true, is. 64 MB models are usually cheap productions that will corrupt your save data.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Excellent CD songs are great and performer is outstanding nice to listen to in the car on long trips especially.
B000OVLINI|5.0|Despite its length, this book is enthralling. It is masterfully written and beautiful. The language is sometimes distracting because it is set in Spain, but it doesn't take away from the story. I love the concept behind this story and was engrossed from start to finish.

B00985E3UG|5.0|[[VIDEOID:3a8b3e58e8925dad54c6bf2a965b81e4]]Maybe it's only because I'm old, and six decades of &quot;doing processed foods&quot; have destroyed more than the average number of brain cells for me, but I can't recall any other book ever having this degree of impact on my behavior. Nor can my husband. But he's old, too. Maybe it is the brain cells thing.<br /><br />Neither of us has been able to shop for groceries, order meals in restaurants, or prepare food at home as we used to, since being swept up by Michael Moss' incredible expos&eacute; of the food industry's masterminds and their discoveries of methods for addicting us to their products. My husband and I are members of the first generation that grew up eating processed foods, but I never actually understood the definition of &quot;processed&quot; in this context prior to reading Salt Sugar Fat. I'd often wondered &quot;why all the fuss about processed foods?&quot; and had no qualms whatsoever about consuming them, if in fact I was. I really wasn't sure. (I know, right?)<br /><br />Thank goodness Moss can unfold a story (even a complicated story involving CHEMISTRY and other things that normally have me yawning a few pages in!) in such an intriguing, mesmerizing manner. Otherwise, I may never have made it to the page that reveals in 1995, when 2 out of 3 kids were drinking a 20-ounce bottle of Coke per day, Coca-Cola's executives weren't referring to the people they'd addicted as &quot;loyal customers&quot; or even &quot;consumers&quot;. No. Coca-Cola called these people &quot;heavy users&quot;. Coca-Cola knew exactly what they were doing, even to kids. But only a couple of the company's executives had trouble sleeping at night, even as the facts about the crisis they were creating became clear. Luckily for us, at least one of those suits had not only a conscience, but a willingness to talk once he'd defected. In addition to the suits, Moss gleaned information from food scientists, government agencies, lawyers, legislators and plenty of other key players in this global addiction story.<br /><br />The revelation of Coca-Cola's terminology was a turning point for me. Not &quot;loyal customers&quot; but &quot;heavy users&quot;. Wow. As I put the book down and turned off the light that evening, I remember smiling, thinking &quot;What's that term from Thomas Kuhn that becomes trendy every now and then? ...paradigm shift... Yeah. So this must be what a paradigm shift feels like. Wow. Shopping for groceries tomorrow will be different&quot;<br /><br />And it was. It still is. My husband and I actually enjoy reading food labels now, and swapping insider jokes about them. But we're serious about what we do and don't allow ourselves to buy and consume now. The foods we eat most often have single word descriptions now. (Ingredients: orange) (Ingredients: carrots) We've each lost several pounds and can more easily exercise for longer intervals now. These physical changes weren't intended, but were definitely welcome and helpful for each of us at our age. I never was addicted to soda. I consumed maybe one soft drink every 6 weeks. My husband, however, was a &quot;heavy user&quot;. One of the most interesting developments as our consumption habits changed: he lost his pot belly. That thing called by many a &quot;beer belly&quot; just melted away over the past 3 months. Maybe it's related to the other physical bonuses I mentioned above, but whatever the catalyst, he looks and feels terrific. Another interesting development which seemingly is related but we're not sure howso: he no longer has the Restless Leg Syndrome he had before we began shopping for, preparing and consuming food differently.<br /><br />Does it sound as if I'm over-dramatizing this story and its impact on us? Maybe. I do lean towards drama-queen communication. But if you do read this book, let me know if you don't agree with this statement: If this real life situation was, instead, a feature film in which evil villainsslowly created, and introduced into society, various chemical products that were designed - no, perfected! - to hook the people of the world into massive, ever-escalating consumption that shortened the life spans of the victims and destroyed the quality of their lives for whatever years they remained alive... it would be a very, very chilling film.<br /><br />The only thing scarier? That it's really happening. Right now. And has been for years.<br /><br />We're the victims. Or not. This book can help you make your choice.created, and introduced into society, various chemical products that were designed - no, perfected! - to hook the people of the world into massive, ever-escalating consumption that shortened the life spans of the victims and destroyed the quality of their lives for whatever years they remained alive... it would be a very, very chilling film.<br /><br />The only thing scarier?

B008P9M614|5.0|Fair warning, this will contain spoilers from throughout the series.  If you have not seen it yet, read at your own risk...<br /><br />House was witty, acerbic, arrogant, and could get away with saying or doing anything (at least in the early seasons) because he was the best at what he did.  It is how we all wish we could be at work from one time to another. Hugh Laurie played him perfectly.  The balance between the gruff Vicodin addicted doctor who did not care, balanced with the friend and co-worker who really did care deep down.  The diagnosis of the week aspect of the show did get repetitive, even in the first season.  It was basically trying to diagnose a mystery disease, being wrong most of the show, and then House dramatically diagnosing the case at the end of the show.  The real meat of what kept the show on the air for 8 years however, was the character interactions.  The patient cases were, for the most part, just a backdrop.<br /><br />The show kind of fell into the trap of what a lot of ensemble cast series do.  As series regulars leave (or have a reduced role) others step in.  At the end of the third season House lost his original team, and basically had a competition throughout season 4 to replace them (which lead to Kal Penn, Olivia Wilde and Peter Jacobson becoming series regulars).  Of the original group Jennifer Morrison was the only one to truly leave the series and the other two shifted roles throughout the rest of the show, with Jesse Spencer's character (Chase) eventually taking over for House in the last episode.<br /><br />The only story (that was not one of the diagnosis related stories) I did not like is how the show handled Cuddy's exit.  Lisa Edelstein decided to leave the show after season 7.  I think it would have been far more effective to have followed through killing her character off as opposed to her just leaving the hospital because of what House does at the end of that season.  Just having Cuddy up and leave went against everything that the character had done up to that point in her interactions with House.  I think it would have been more effective to have killed off her character, then developed a story where House had to deal with that loss, then done something to end up in jail (that actually made sense).<br /><br />By the 8th season I do think the show had become somewhat stale.  I think having Foreman take over Cuddy's job really underutilized his character, and there were a lot of episodes that season where Omar Epps was only in the show for a couple minutes.  I think the character was always better as a part of House's team, than when they had him as the boss.  I think that the addition of Odette Annable (Odette Yustman for you Cloverfield fans who are in denial about her being married) and Charlene Yi, were good. Even though Olivia Wilde left the show that season (aside from appearances in the early on in the season and the last episode), the fact that Chase and Taub were still around gave it a sense of continuity.  I also really liked Wilson's cancer storyline.  It provided some really good moments without just killing him off in the final episode.  It was also nice how they brought in many of the characters from the past in for the series finale.  I would have liked to see Cameos of Chi McBride's character from season 1 and the Officer from season 3 in the final episode as one of the hallucinations.  But the fact that they got as many people back for the episode as they did was able to give the show a sense of closure.  Having House and Wilson ride off into the sunset at the end was the perfect way for the show to go out.<br /><br />I have the individual seasons (the first 5 on DVD and the last 3 on Blu Ray), not this actual box set.  I know in the season sets, each one has some behind the scenes material and features.  Nothing too extensive on any of them, but good for what they are.  I do not know if those have been included in this set or if there is anything added to this onenot in the individual sets.  I do think that Universal should put the entire series out in Blu Ray, but if that is not important to you, then I think this is worth getting.  However you get the shows, it is one of the better series that has been on TV the last few years, and is definitely worth the purchase.

B007SY3CEW|4.0|I love the parts of this app that I can actually use.  The problem is that if you have a Kindle Fire, you can't play 3-note chords.  Even worse, older fingers aren't always nimble enough to play 2-note chords even if the device can!  I don't expect to ever score better than a B grade on very fast pieces, but that's OK.  I like a slightly slower beat in ragtime, and Scott Joplin and I do just fine at the apprentice level, and I can get a grade of AAA at the beginner level now!<br /><br />I would pay big bucks (well, at least $3 to $5!) if the developer of this app would sell me NOT Beethoven, NOT all Christmas Music, and certainly NOT national anthems, but an app of music at a level of difficulty no higher than what is labeled &#34;normal&#34; on this app!  It would be great if it could include a few show-tunes, but I'm aware of copyright issues.  Still, a few more folk songs or patriotic songs  would also be nice (preferably NOT too many of the &#34;For he's a jolly good fellow&#34; or what you call &#34;Alabama&#34; and we call &#34;Oh Suzanna&#34; ilk, however).  And hey, the audience for such an app actually knows who Stephen Collins Foster is and many still like his music!  Finally, if you could keep keep most of the songs under 3 minutes, that wouldn't hurt either.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A dictionary is almost always good and helpful and accurate--especially if it's a Merriam-Webster!  I just wish they'd document, even briefly, how to use the thing.  I 'll supply what they don't:  as you type in the word you want to look up, a list of possible matching words begins to appear below the bar where your typing appears.  You must find in this list the closest match to the word you're looking for, and you have to press on that word.  You cannot just type a word and push the Enter or the Return button.  You cannot press or click on or do anything in the text that you've typed.  Just press a word in the list that comes up below where you've typed!  So simple!!!  But not intuitive enough to have saved me several frustrating minutes trying to figure it out! I hope I've spared you that one drawback of this otherwise excellent free app.

B00932A4XE|4.0|Ok, I admit it - I enjoyed this movie. I rented it more for my wife, but I think there were parts in it we equally enjoyed - some we both liked and some definitely skewed toward moms and dads - but it felt fairly balanced.<br /><br />Great cast, mostly decent characters and no big gaps in the story line, etc. I doubt this will be as much a staple as the book is for expectant moms (and dads too). But It didn't feel like a waste of an evening!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Just superb from start to finish-but I wouldn't expect anything less from guys like Soderberg and Fincher! A real thriller
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|This movie nicely weaves its way into the storyline that was started by LOTR. Though only the first of the Hobbit Trilogy, it seems Peter Jackson and company wanted to insure The Hobbit could be viewed before or after LOTR. So far it seems they've done a good job.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, excellent story line and incredibly acted (as with the LOTR). Definitely a movie I plan to purchase and add to my permanent collection to watch again and again.

1476729719|5.0|This was only the second Jodi Picoult novel I've read, the first being The Pact.  I loved this book to the point where I could barely put it down to do something else.  I think it portrays quite accurately what bullying is and how often it happens in plain sight, as well as what could happen to someone who becomes a victim of bullying for their entire life.  This book dealt with so many more issues than just the bullying, from being a single parent and not being sure of how to parent, to \\"favoring\\" one child over another, to teen angst and cliques, to where a mother's job fits in terms of her family.  I think anyone could benefit from reading this book because even though it is just a novel, in my opinion it accurately depicts a lot of issues that are very prevalent in today's society.  I think it was a great book, I loved the ending, and I am certainly looking forward to reading more of Jodi Picoult's novels.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie has it all, including a small part played by the director himself. Love and loss and fighting and lotsa great shots to the body with flesh and blood flying, but in almost an over the top kinda way.

Still a pleasant movie.

0062238868|4.0|Chris Kyle was assassinated on Feb. 2, 2013. The person accused of killing Chris has at this writing still not been charged with his death some three months later. Supposedly, the assassin is some kinda American lone nut, like Oswald, Sirhan or Chapman. But could his motivation be caused by some urge to silence Kyle or kill him for what he has already revealed?<br /><br />Even though the military okayed his writing, Chris Kyle in his book AMERICAN SNIPER paints an ugly picture of the War in Iraq and the \\"Head Shed\\" leaders, generals and politicians who ran the War. Any one of  his criticisms about the war's ineptitudes might have been enough to have him killed. Also, we must be aware of how many Navy SEALs have been killed in accidents, murders and helicopter crashes since the SEALs supposedly killed Osama Bin Laden. Are the SEALs talking too much? Do these SEALs know too much? Is someone afraid that these SEALs will talk about the facts of the Bin Laden \\"murder\\"?<br /><br />AMERICAN SNIPER depicts Chris Kyle as a young, married, fun-loving, fist-fight provoking Navy SEAL. But Kyle was also an immature killer, unable to be a man and help his real family. He was shown as a statistic-loving sniper proud of his kills. He was also a boy-man who loved his fellow soldiers more than he loved his wife and kids. He showed himself to be a proud Texan who had the nickname \\"Tex\\" and who loved beer-drinking, excitement and hatred of the enemy more than he thought about the illegal, immoral war he was fighting. Kyle has no problem dissing his war leaders for being wimps at the same time he's wasting his life and his wife and his kids while re-upping for another tour of duty.<br /><br />Patriotism can blind you. Patriotism can cause you to hate. Patriotism can cover over the fact that politicians want Texas to secede from your god-blessed country. So...if this is true, why do you choose to kill and possibly die for your god-blessed country when your god-blessed state of Texas wants to secede from the Union?s to secede from the Union?

B00CWVGBEO|1.0|Aside from a terrible script, bad acting, bad directing and poor editing, the movie has nothing going for it. It's the story of a drug king pin trying to escape to Mexico. He and his moronic associates go head to head against an army of totally inept, clumsy, and totally stupid FBI agents. They manage to make it to an equally inept red neck town full of residents with IQ's less than their age. They are finally bested by an over the hill (Arnold) sheriff who has seen better days. The movie is slightly less exciting as watching paint dry.

B00A7W29BE|3.0|Someone plz tell me the difference between this app and taking a picture with the phone (more ability to manipulate image with the app)? Yes, I am not saavy so don't make fun of me :o)
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I had trouble following it and fell asleep. She later said it was a disappointment as well. I would wait for it to appear on Netflix or Hulu.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Most of the movie plays out at night, high, high above \\"The Street\\" in one of those typical computer screen lit, fully glass windowed trading offices. A lot has changed since the time of the original 1987 \\"Wall Street\\" movie. Greed is still good and well, but there is no more charismatic Gordon Gekko trying to get ahead with stolen insider trading information. This is 2008, when most of the financial world is playing with fire; as financial \\"products\\" (mortgage backed securities, credit default swaps and extreme leveraging) with immense complexities create incredible profits, seemingly nobody knows exactly how the money flows from pockets to pockets. Nobody seems to understand the risks either, although there is a risk management team, everybody seems to be more annoyed with the signs of trouble than trying to heed the warning. In fact, the movie starts with the firing of one of the risk management analysts. Instead of Gordon Gekko there is only a seemingly clueless CEO, \\"John Tuld\\" (played superbly by Jeremy Irons). You may notice the name is slightly similar to Richard S. Fuld (Lehman Brothers).<br /><br />The story is well described in all the earlier previews. What is the most striking motif here is that while the traders do their job by selling and buying massive amount of money segments, only few brokers with background in mathematics, physics (rocket science) could grasp the concept of volatility associated with the process. In fact, the higher position is someone in management, the more the single whistle blower trader (\\"Peter Sullivan\\" played by Zachary Quinto) has to dumb down the explanation of the problem in order to be understood. But the problem is about to wreak havoc and billions of dollars could disappear ending the existence of this fictional firm, as the meltdown and financial crisis of 2008 is about to explode.<br /><br />So time is money. The trading firm has to unload all of its toxic assets as fast as possible to make the most of the money while the rest of the financial world is still unaware of the disappearing value. Few points in sale price may mean 130 million dollar loss, yet the firm keeps unloading and liquidating its assets in a single day. This fire sale disregards any professionalism; a suicide mission that ignores friendship, trust, morals, the discount sale of worthless products means the acceptance of career ending loss of trust as well.<br /><br />The cast is excellent. But Kevin Spacey gives the most gripping characterization of all. Above the level of management where an outside firing squad in a day could destroy his career by asking him to pack his belongings, he is also below the level of management where he would be truly untouchable and wealthy, he is the only one with moral dilemma. While everyone is talking about profits, income, cars and strippers, he is concerned about his professional credibility. He worries abbout the firm. He worries about the employees. He worries about the financial world. He worries, because seemingly he is the only one who cares about something else or more than money. But he does what needs to be done; single handedly and with nerves of steel he commands the remaining traders to sell off the assets. He only breaks down at the very end of the movie, crying alone in the dark while he has to bury his beloved dog.<br /><br />An excellent movie it is in the spirit of \\"Glengarry Glenn Ross\\", \\"Wall Street\\" and \\"Boiler Room\\".le the rest of the financial world is still unaware of the disappearing value.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I couldn't put this book down from the end of page 1. It is a great tome of geek and pop references.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|When my 2008 Macbook Pro died at age 4, I purchased a new Macbook Pro Retina right away. Because I had two older power supplies from my previous Macbook, this adapter was required. The older power connector simply does not fit onto a newer Macbook Pro. The new connector is slimmer.<br /><br />This small device does the job. It's magnetic, so it just snaps onto the older power cord and you're ready to go. Just don't lose it. If you drop it, or just toss it into a drawer, it's hard to find. I lost one once already. It's possible that it got sucked into my vacuum cleaner.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|Hendrix.  What else is there to say?  This album may not be as great as the ones that came out when he was alive, but it is pretty good, and it's amazing to hear new Hendrix -- to hear his voice and his style in new songs.  I bought this in vinyl and also as a CD.  I wouldn't have missed it for anything.
B004XANKVO|5.0|I was looking for a roomy and versatile bag for carrying a lot of technology.  I usually carry two laptops and a multitude of cables, connectors etc with me every day.  I also have at least two tablets with me as well.  This bag has all the room I need and then some.  I love the protective glasses case on the outside.  It makes it very easy to access my glasses when needed.  The bag is sturdy and comfortable.  I was a little put off by the price to begin with, but I have come to the conclusion that it was worth the cost.
069111966X|4.0|I bought this book for a few college students. This book was highly recommended by a Math professor for students to have a fun reading. The students really liked it!
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The visuals and storytelling of this film are glorious!<br /><br />The scene near the end when &#34;what really happened&#34; was pulled from Pi I thought to be unnecessary.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love hill climb racing game. it's one of my go to Borden game. you have to try it out I love it!!!!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I haven't tried it yet! But saw all the good reviews so ordered it. Will use it this winter for sure!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|How refreshing to find a game that doesn't insult your intelligence, isn't monotonous, not wanting the game to end and wondering if this company makes any other games. I want more...I want more!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|THE game itself is awesome. But I had 7/8 signs when I was walking through the cemetery on the farm. Fun, but needs a little work. *recommended
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a real cool game it always has action, plus it is cool you can buy all the suit with real money.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|This is a solid album from the AIC guys. Standout songs for me are Hung on a Hook, Stone and Breath on a Window. Musically, this is a very moody feast for the senses. There aren't too many real hard rockers on here, Phantom Limb probably the most aggressive. Lots of mid-tempo sludge, very haunting melodies at times.<br />My only gripe so far is that I would have liked to hear more lead vocals from William DuVall. He is front and center on a few songs but most he is taking part in main or background harmony. As such some songs sound straight out of Jerry Cantrell's solo albums, which depending on your experience with them could be positive or negative. I happen to like them, so it worked ok for me.<br /><br />Most importantly, though, people need to give AIC albums many listens before making their minds. This album is a 'grower'!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Our son loved his WubbaNub! He just recently gave up the pacifier, but up til now, he looked forward to going to bed each night so he could spend time with his WubbaNub. It helped him find his pacifier at night so we didn't have to go into his room and find it for him, and it works like a stuffed animal too, giving him comfort from the personality of the animal. If our second son, born recently, desires a pacifier as well, we'll be getting him a WubbaNub as well.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Finally you get an album from ALL of the Bee Gees  You get to hear each one sing and hear the BEST of the Bee Gees from the begining
B00CHI5F5S|3.0|Very much like the Untouchables, I would put the two movies on par with each other, time is on the Untouchables side to see which is the better movie.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Some of the BEST relaxing, peaceful, entertaining music I have ever come across Thanks We need LOTS more of this kind of music  Videos would be nice too
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I definitely recommend this movie, the plot is solid, with some twists and turns not expected. Worth your time if you like Tom Cruise.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Have had Original AKG K-240's (600ohm) for many, many years.  Needed headphones that would be able to be powered by a Smartphone/Tablet/PC.  New one's still will need a real amp (receiver, etc.) or a headphone amp to get the most out of the new model, but, a PC sound card can get decent sound.  Love the sound (Open, clear, better bass than the originals (tight)), The Fit (lightweight, comfortable, self-adjusting).<br /><br />  Don't listen to the audio snobs, if you want a pair of good quality, inexpensive cans, you can't go wrong with these.  Remember, you have to &#34;Break-In&#34; any Dynamic headphones for at least 50 Hours at higher than normal levels to get the best sound out of them.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|Close to the original production.  The finale fellatio is gone but pretty much everthing else is still there.  It was not the version that removed all the nasties that allow the Brits to stand alone.  Pretty tame stuff considering what is available on the internet.  The lesbian scene is still great.  Good collector item.
0689877692|5.0|Miniature art sculptures come to life with each page turn.  A puzzel book to find the hidden red dot in each art piece.  Each one is a different delight.  recommend the whole David Carter series.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I'm generally very turned off by dramedy films because they mix the two elements so poorly. But this movie has a flawless balance of the two and makes for a great unique experience.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|This was the first scary movie that I had ever watched..  I was very young and when I saw it I was wondering why and the heck was I sent to watch this movie..  BUT it was great..  Funny but it was a family night movie..
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This represents the first and only time so far that Scorsese has won Best Director at the Academy Awards (even though he still deserved others). But at the very least he was able to win it for what I see as his best film.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Better than season one, in which the characters are more complex and real.  The plot is complex and the use of symbols is much more intergrated into the story.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|The director's cut is a welcome addition and makes it much more fascinating than the theatrical version. The best part of the movie is the production value, including the costumes, scenery, cinematography, and editing.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is an easy way to access email from the Kindle.  Instead of going through the internet this app takes me directly to my email.
B001FB4W16|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister who was very into the Twilight series, so I thought she might like this kind of series. She was happy with my selection.
B00969PR18|4.0|One of the reasons I got the kindle fire was so I could have a portable, searchable map.  And of course for the videos, audibles, and books.  I don't have a smart phone, and my gps TOM TOM lies and is slow!  I don't like to print out maps.  So the map app is just what I needed.<br /><br />You can use it offline, as long as you have purchased the state or country you needed.  The prices are fair.  If you are looking for an offline map, this really isn't free.  But for 1.99 I can get the state I'm in.  I used the Amazon coins promotion, so I didn't spend a dime.<br /><br />You can zoom, make favorite destinations, and even find a place to eat; all offline.  Give it a try!
B001JQTSG6|5.0|I won't lie. I'm a huge Scorsese fanboy, so I am biased toward this movie. But it's an incredible classic. Especially the bloody fight scene where Jake just lets himself get pounded.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|....even after reading it the second time.  I love all of Colleens books and have read them multiple times.  I highly recommend this book as well as her others.
B000NTPDSW|2.0|The original Godfather is a perfect film, but the 2nd and 3rd just get sequentially worse. Don't waste your money on this set. Just buy the original separately.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|I loved reading this short book. He packed it with all of the true that anybody who has owned or wants to own a business. My husband and I used to have a store front business which we sold. Now, eight years later we want to open another business with a different approach and we wanted to get our butts to working and this book pushed us to that. thanks to Mark!
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|Even if you have absolutely no interest in Facebook (like me), you should still find this a captivating drama and worthy of its Academy Award nominations and wins.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|awesome should get perfect. for a vacation anybody can get this for free. awesome. you can breed. dragons. and other. stuff
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Day-Lewis's performance in this film is by far the best performance he has ever done, and even one of the best screen performances of all time.
B00CATSONE|4.0|It was a good read. Short enough to read in one sitting. Not heavy on the scientific specifics. Very inspirational in regards to using your imagination.
B001V9LPWQ|2.0|I know it's supposed to be a kid's film, but I just didn't enjoy this one bit. Plus, there's nothing special about the Blu-ray version. Sure, it's higher quality image, but what's the point with this kind of movie?
B002CNOA6S|5.0|I really loved this movie as much this time as the last time I saw it in the theater  thanks for making it available.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Even after Skyfall, which was a superb film, Casino Royale still stands up as the greatest Bond movie that I have ever seen.
