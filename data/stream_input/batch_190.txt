B00003CX9Q|5.0|I loved it when I watched it when I was 5 years old. I loved it when I was 13, I loved it more when I am 19. This movie for me is the most emotional movie of all time. The music is my favorite score from Williams which maybe is 50% of the picture. I just watched the new Special Edition trailer and got tears in my eyes again just by watching the trailer. I just can't wait for the re-release. And I recommend this movie to every human of every age. Watch this movie to &quot;remember&quot; that friendship doesn't have any boundries.<br />P.S.<BR>I hope that in the DVD release of the Special Edition they put an isolated music track like in the Laserdisc Box Edition.
B000000W74|4.0|This is a very good album from one of the greatest men in all of music history, John Lee Hooker. This album has a mellow mood to it that makes it perfect to listen too when you want to Chill Out. The title track, is a collaboration with Carlos Santana, a long-time fan of JLH. That song is a classic and was the reason I bought the album in the first place. Other stand out songs here are KIDDIO, ANNIE MAE, TOO YOUNG, ONE BOURBON ONE SCOTCH ONE BEER, and MEDLEY: SERVES ME RIGHT TO SUFFER/SYNDICATOR. Many songs here are updated classics that will sound fresh to new fans. I think that some of the songs on this album where it is JLH and his guitar are without a doubt, the songs that we are able to see how great his talent really voice. He had that perfect voice for his storytelling type of blues music that kept the listener hooked.
6302759110|4.0|The tradition of the Dracula film, which has lasted almost since the movies began, is undoubtedly the main influence on the making of the film. There are influences which date back to the Hammer films of the 1950s to 1970s, and of course the very fact that the film was made must have its roots in the Universal films or even in Nosferatu. Another influence was the &quot;Dark Knight franchise makeover&quot;, deriving its name from the way Batman was reinvented initially in comic books, and then for the big screen in the 1980s. In both cases, a reinvention was necessary because both characters and genres had become associated with clich&eacute; and spoof. We needed to be able to take our heroes and villains seriously again and films like Batman and Dracula gave us that opportunity.<br />Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 film (not directed by Bram Stoker, as the title implies) has its heritage in the 1980s gothic revival. It was not uncommon in the late 1980s to attend a pop concert and find people dressed as vampires, even to the extent of having their teeth filed into fangs, and the glamorisation of vampirism is nowhere more evident in the casting of Sadie Frost as a vampire neophyte.<br />Perhaps the Vlad The Impaler sub-story could have been omitted as this detracts from the idea of this being Bram Stoker's Dracula<br />To reinvent the genre, a different approach has been taken to several of the standard elements of Dracula films. The Count is not the debonair  creature portrayed by Lugosi or Lee, although he is no less charming. The prefacing of the title with 'Bram Stoker's' suggests authenticity, as if this is the definitive version. It is understandable that the film-makers wanted to do this, because how else would they tell the public this wasn't just another Dracula movie, and break away from the camp that the name would otherwise imply? It is interesting to note that since this was made, vampire films have all tried a different angle, such as The Vampire Of Brooklyn, Interview With A Vampire, and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The sets are beautifully made, at once magnificent and decaying, reflecting the nature of the film's central character.<br />Apart from Gary Oldman, the most outstanding member of the cast has to be Anthony Hopkins. He makes Van Helsing less sympathetic than the traditional Peter Cushing character, but that might just be my soft spot for Cushing. Hopkins gives the character some menace that makes you believe that he is a worthy adversary to the count.erview With A Vampire, and Buffy The Vampire Slayer.

B00003CXAA|4.0|The Godfather Collection was the first DVD set that I bought and I enjoyed it. I truly love the movies with the GODFATHER 1 being my favorite. I was hoping to see some additional footage not in the video  versions, but scenes that we have seen when the movies are being played on cable tv. The was the reason for the 4 stars. I like the DVD collection better than video for the mere fact that I dont have to get up and change the tapes, except for the GODFATHER 2 here. In my opinion that makes the movies easier to watch and enjoy. If you love the Godfater Trilogy, I dont think that this set will disappoint you. Watching the bonus disc with all the behind the scenes stuff makes this set worth the price.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I just cruised through the new CD and a couple of the songs are good, however, the majority are still geared towards the versatile 12 year old.  With Britney's limited vocal ability she is going to have to do much better than this if she wants to break into a lasting universal diva like Mariah, Madonna and Janet.   If she continues to only appeal to 12 year olds her career will never make it into the next decade.   &quot;Slave&quot; is by far the best song, don't expect much better.   Looks like the label is trying to sell sex appeal her more than anything.......which is not a good sign.
0783225970|5.0|This movie is a classic. I know that it is a remake of an older film, but I think that this updated version hits the mark. Al Pacino plays TONY MONTANA, a Cuban refugee that becomes the drug czar of Miami in the early 80's. I think that Pacino gives us an outstanding performance as we see his character rise to the top of the drug business and than we see him self-destruct in the final violent, bloody, climatic scene. The movie also boasts another bloody scene that viewers wont forget. It appears in the first 30 minutes or so when a friend of Tony's is massacred using a chain saw in a drug deal gone bad. When this movie first came out, some many people oppossed it because of the violence that it received publicity that only helped to make it even that more popular. We are also given bonus materials that takes us through the making of the film which I think the viewer will find interesting.
B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is pop.  They were from the beginning along with Static X, Kittie, and all those other &quot;hardcore&quot; bands.  And why does it take 2 drummers to do the same bass drum roll preformed by Danny Carey of Tool?  I would buy Britney Spears sooner than this crap soley because no one denies that she is a pop artist.
B00005QGAT|5.0|It's hard to believe that 22 years have passed since the original release of this classic album. For me, it's a bit difficult not to be slightly opinionated about &quot;Off The Wall&quot; since I've worn out several vinyl copies(and a couple of CD's too!!) of it playing it at home and on DJ gigs over the years. In spite of hearing these songs countless times, this album has managed to transcend the time in which it was created. Everything from the strength of the songs, to the excellent musicianship and production, &quot;Off The Wall&quot; is a perfect album. At the center of it all is the man himself. Never before or since has Michael sang with that sense of joy and exuberance as he does on this record. Every cut is a standout from &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get Enough&quot; to &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;. While I was hoping for a little more in site from the interviews on the CD, the demos of &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Working Day And Night&quot; alone made the album worth purchasing again. I was very surprised at how fully realized these songs were at this early stage. At long last this album sounds the way it always should have on CD. The new remaster is stunning with all of the ambience and clarity that was missing from the previous CD issue. It was literally like hearing it for the first time. The packaging is nice, although I would have liked to have seen them use the original cover art with Michael's face on the front. An first rate reissue and highly recommended.
068484267X|4.0|Being a teenager, Angela's Ashes didn't automatically appeal to me. It sounded more like a book my mother would enjoy, especially because it's a \\"memoir\\"- kind of a scary word for a young person, because it seems to predict a drab, boring life story. The beginning of the book was difficult to get into, mostly because about a million characters are introduced in the first fifty pages. <BR>However, after I got into the story, it was really easy reading. It's a very well written book. The main characters have many dimensions and lots of personality, which is probably because the story is a true account of Frank McCourt's life. The story is about an extremely poor family, and their move to Ireland, where the father and mother were born and raised. The McCourts face many hardships, such as the death of children, and the fact that the dad, also named Frank McCourt, drinks away the little money they have in Irish pubs almost every night. <BR>I found I was most drawn to the father as a character. He is depicted as a wonderful dad who would do anything for his family. All of his sons look up to him a great deal, and they see only the good qualities in him. He turns right around and betrays their trust, though, by acting as though he doesn't have a family to support. Through a flurry of job loses, caused when he drinks too much on his pay days, and not being able to get up the next morning, he ruins any chances the family has to live normal lives. He is continuously forgiven for his mistakes. <BR>Although Angela's Ashes is at times very sad, it is also tremendously entertaining, and in many cases, funny. I would highly recommend it.
B00005QDW5|5.0|If you're new to Pink Floyd or an old time fan like myself, you will love this album. It features the old and new. Classic songs when Syd Barrett was with the band and newer classics when Roger Waters left the band. The songs on these discs blend together in a way that hasn't been done before. For a classic fan, you'll love the way songs come together in such an unexpected way. For example, when Keep Talking comes in and the end of Money, when you expect Us and Them to come in. This is a fantastic set. 5 Stars all the way. I'm going to type this with the hope that David Gilmour and Roger Waters will read it, however unlikely it may be. And I encourage any Pink Floyd to do the same. <br />David,Roger, Nick and Richard, you guys are the greatest musicians I have ever listened to. Do all your fans a favor and get back together. Put your personal differences aside and do another Dark Side of the Moon, or at least one last killer show. You guys are the best, no doubt about it.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Put quite simply, this is the best pop CD released in a very long time. If you like R&amp;B, Pop, or Rock, this is a CD for you. All the songs are fantastic!
B00004WG28|4.0|I am sorry to all those who fell this movie is boring or not very good,but in my opionion I would say this movie is very good. This movie is adapted from the not forgotton THE KING AND I. In this movie it is pretty the same plot. Only the story is changed a little bit. For one there is no singing. I won't give away everything so I will just say I love the way this movie goes. Anna is an ambitious women who is not afraid to stand up to anyone. She defys all odds. She comes to teach the King's many childern in school. While she is there she changes the way Siam is and the King of course. As the King's prime minister said,&quot;She think she is equal to a man!&quot; The King replys,&quot;No she thinks she is equal to a king.&quot; Jodie Foster and Chow-Yun-Fat are great together on the screen. The costumes are wonderful! <BR>I would say if you love movies that make you feel good this one! Watch as Anna forever changes the King. And the King changes her.

0140189378|5.0|Absolutely first-rate American novel of alienation.  Tommy Wilhelm reaches mid-life with a divorce, a lost job, and a father who won't pay his debts.  Tommy asks &quot;How could I have been such a jerk as not to prepare for anything and just go on luck and inspiration?&quot;  It all goes down hill from there, Tommy's Dad telling him for good measure, &quot;Those who wait for help must wait for help. You have to stop waiting.&quot;  But Tommy can't, and we watch him till the bitter end. Brilliant writing; personally I feel this is much better than his longer, three-hundred pagers which tend to get diffuse and laden-down with theories and name-dropping.  Here Bellow is writing tightly and concisely (like in his other great short novel, Dangling Man).<br />This otherwise handsome Penguin edition comes with a tedious, thirteen-page introduction by Cynthia Ozick, doyenne of the novel-as-text-to-be-taught-in-the-classroom school, a particulary inelegant writer to stick before Bellow (who is &quot;irrefragably American&quot; according to her).  There is no need for her introduction, or anybody's, because Bellow is such a good writer the reader will have no problem understanding him.  Why Ozick's superfluous bad prose at the start to mess this beauty up?
B00005OM4N|4.0|This new album is definatly a new look at our Britney. She definatly changed her style, for better or for worse. She went in the same direction as NSYNC*, which was a more techno sound to their music. As a lot of people saw, many of the old NSYNC* fans didn't like the change in music and left their favorite boy band behind. Lets hope this doesn't happen to our girl Britney!
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad was a very interesting book. It taught about how to make a business successful and how to make money work for you. I particulalry liked when lessons were taught to the two main characters. You can really understand it on how kids think money is made they think it is very simple but yet they learn by reading this book. It showed me a different perspective on how money is really made. It's hard work if you want it to be hard.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Everyone wants to grow up, especially Britney and her buddies NYSNC, both of whom have released &quot;maturing&quot; albums, neither of whom have any real hit songs that their fan base wants to embrace.  Is this a pause or plateau until the next album finds surer footing?  My rating of each song<br />1. I'm A Slave 4 U: not a hit, not appreciated by fans.<br />2. Overprotected:  Potential hit but not on first listening<br />3. Lonely:  Potential hit but not on first listening.<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman: Labeled a hit but it's not.<br />5. Boys:  Mediocre at best.<br />6. Anticipating: Medicore at best<br /> 7. I Love Rock 'n' Roll:  Why is the most famous pop diva do ing cover songs?  Lash the producers for this one.<br />8. Cinderella: Potential hit after several listenings.<br />9. Let Me Be:  Part of On the Line album---best song on this album too.<br />10. Bombastic Love:  Where did they get this one?<br />11. That's Where You Take Me:  Lead me over a cliff.<br />12. What It's Like To Be Me:  Maturation, Menarche and Mystery since we still don't know what it's like.<br />In summary, she is riding on her hype, like Maria on her new album and NYSNC on Celebrity all of which struggle to find any songs that are top hits let alone be played one year from now.<br />Britney:  get new producers and song writers and quit writing your own songs.
B00005O3VD|4.0|First off - the DVD: It's a letterbox transfer of pristine new print that has been digitally restored (sometimes frame by frame) back to its original condition. Funny Girl hasn't looked this good in thirty years - so if you've only seen it on VHS or TV, you're in for a visual treat. I saw the restored print on a huge screen this past fall, and believe me, this transfer does it justice. In addition they have included the pre-show and intermission music as well. The additional documentary material is nothing to write home about. But I think whoever did the DVD menu deserves kudos for styling it like the New Amsterdam theater marquee from the first shot of the movie, with highlights from the film playing in the background. Very appropriate and very clever.     Funny Girl is A.) the musical biography of comedienne-singer Fanny Brice, and B.) the Oscar-winning film debut of 26 year old Barbra Streisand. As theatrical history lesson it's pretty flawed - (Arnstein was Brice's *second* husband, for example).   The Streisand - Brice connection is strong, however.  Fanny, like Barbra, wore her Jewishness as a badge of honor - in contrast to most Jewish performers of the day, who tried to blend in as much as possible.  As a matter of fact, the \\"You Are Woman, I Am Man\\" seduction scene plays like a Brice \\"Follies\\" sketch.      And as a star vehicle for Striesand, it's a winner. \\"I'm the Greatest Star\\" at the beginning of the picture is an electrifying jolt of raw, pure talent.  At the end of them film when she falters on the opening words of \\"My Man\\", you'll remember what it feels like to watch your beloved walk out of your life.      William Wyer seems to be aware that he's launching a new star.  The way he introduces Barbra - that long walk with her back to the camera in the leopard coat - ending with the first teasing glimpse of her face in the mirror - \\"Hello, gorgeous.\\"   It was a closeup that many film folk were sure would have audiences recoiling in horror.  Certainly plain looking Barbra couldn't make it as a movie star.  Well, it's not news anymore but it turns out that Barbra photographs beautifully.  Even Barbra-hater Rex Reed had to admit at the time, \\"It took the combined efforts of God knows how many people to do it, but I'll be damned if they haven't made her beautiful!\\"     Omar Sharif plays opposite Barbra, and he holds up his end of the film nicely, no small feat when you consider that the script gives him little to do and the entire property has been tailored to Streisand's strengths. No one else registers, with the possible exception of Kay Medford as Fanny's mother. (Poor Anne Francis sued Columbia after the film was released, claiming Streisand had her cut out of the finished film. Most of you are sitting there thinking, \\"Anne, who?\\")     All in all, one of the better Sixties Broadway musical adaptations. (Note: Funny Girl was nominated for Best Picture in 1968. It lost to another Columbia Pictures musical - Oliver! If you liked Funny Girl, check out Oliver! - it's a better movie, even though it has no star names over the title. More 1968 Oscar trivia - Barbra won for Best Actress in a tie with Kathrine Hepburn of \\"Lion in Winter\\". In Oscar balloting there can only be a tie when there are the exact same number of votes. Why do I mention this? Well, it just so happens that because of her \\"special stature\\" in the industry, Barbra Streisand was admitted as a voting member of the Academy that year - with the release of just her first film. I wonder who she voted for???? If she hadn't been given special treatment, maybe Kate Hepburn's name would had been the only one announced that night!)
B00005LC1H|4.0|The picture quality is so much better than the VHS versions!  However, there are only a few out-takes included and as the other reviewers mentioned, the director's commentary is a waste of space.<br />The interviews with John Cleese and &quot;Manuel&quot; Andrew Sachs are good but it is the wonderful quality of the picture that makes this set a must-buy for the Fawlty Towers aficionado.
B000021YQV|5.0|Like the title says, this is the best CD ever.  I don't know why all those people out there who hate good music talk trash about System of a Down. I'd like to see the stuff they listen to. It's probably some stuff they found in their parent's record collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Aight, here we go:<BR>The enhanced disc with a performance of &quot;Overprotected&quot; starts off with the first single of the album:<br />I'm A Slave 4 U-Hot, new beat. Quite the ear candy. Though it only contains one verse, the song doesn't lose its hold. It truly captivates you into a world of pop and just makes you wanna dance.<BR>Rating: 9.9/10<br />Overprotected-A Max Martin song. But an extremely, good and catchy one! One of the highlights of the disc. Also makes you just wanna get up and dance.<br />9.9/10<br />Lonely-Another upbeat song. The bridge of this song is awesome. A real girl power song about a girl saying she'd rather be alone than be with a guy that's mistreated her.<BR>9.6/10<br />I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman-The only real ballad on the CD. When I first heard it, it was an okay ballad. But after a few listens and a look at the lyrics, I got into it and I applied it to my life. Plus, good vocals!<BR>9.7/10<br />Boys-A song you would most likely hear in a club. Like the previous song, it took a few listens to really get into it. I like it now, though. It has a different, kind of offbeat rhythm than what you would find in her previous work (BOMT, OIDIA), kinda like &quot;Slave&quot;.<BR>9.3/10<br />Anticipating-I'm just not feeling this song. It's a Janet Jackson kind of ditty with happy disco beats. I don't like it that much, but it's still okay.<BR>7/10<br />I Love Rock n' Roll-Great cover, the beats are awesome. And you can just feel the attitude in her voice. Cool song.<BR>9.5/10<br />Cinderella-Umm...I think this should've been on OIDIA. No surprise, it's made by Max Martin.  Not that it's bad or anything. I like it! So...<BR>9.6/10<br />Let Me Be-Oooooh! I just love the little tropical beat to this song. Awesome beat, good vocals, catchy, overall great song.<BR>9.9/10<br />Bombastic Love-When I first heard the title, I was like, &quot;What the heck?! This better not be a reggae, Shaggy-like song!&quot; Thank the Lord it wasn't.  But anyways...I dunno. Doesn't the chorus sound like &quot;Oops!&quot;??? Still, an extremely pop tune. And I mean catchy. This could stick in your head for weeks.  Oh, and I also love the beginning intro part (with the, it kinda sounds like a triangle, don't it?)<BR>9.5/10<br />That's Where You Take Me-Sweet, kind of ballad. Whenever you listen to it, you just start smiling, don't you? Just try to resist it!  <BR>9.8/10<br />What It's Like To Be Me-Awesome string outro! You can just tell it was written by Justin and Wade. Tight beat and awesome chorus. Another song where you can just hear the attitude in Brit's voice.<BR>9.5/10<br />EXTRA TRACKS:<br />Intimidated-Cool track. Kinda like &quot;Boys&quot;, but not so clubbish (not exactly a word...but that's okay  ). Catchy and cool track. I like the vocals, they were done really well!<BR>9.4/10<br />Before The Goodbye-Why was this song cut?! (Well, okay, we all know, but you know my point) Upbeat ballad. The backup vocals are too heavy, but otherwise, I love this song! I love the part where she sings it kinda accapella. And the guitar outro...oooh, very Madonna!<BR>9.8/10<br />When I Found You-I love the strings in this song. I want this song to be on the album so bad!  But I have it dl-ed on my computer, so I'm happy!  Beautiful ballad, I love it.<BR>10/10<br />I Run Away-The strings are the absolute best! This whole song is so beautiful! I want it to be on the CD so bad! It's such a beautiful ballad! It's VERY Madonna, and very mature. I also love the back ground music throughout the whole thing. And the violin that goes through it is amazing. (If only I could do vibrato like that...but I'm still working on it...whoops. A little off-topic.) and there's a part where britney sings acapella except for a guitar, which sounds so amazing! I love this song!<BR>11/10<br />Overall, this CD is great, and I totally love it!  So, take a listen to it first to be the own judge of it, and buy it!
B00004T37H|5.0|I'll admit it. I've never liked anime, even before it became the craze it is now. When I heard about Princess Mononoke, I just shrugged it off and rolled my eyes. Gradually, as I began to hear more about it, I developed a curiousity for it. When I heard it was playing on Starz, I decided it would be a good chance to try it; after all, it was free.<br />-This movie blew me away.- The animation is superb (being an animation major in college, I'm picky about those things), the storyline interesting, and every shot was beautiful. My younger sister and I originally were watching it to make fun of it (as we do with many anime shows and movies) but we ended up loving the movie far more than we ever imagined. I loved the movie for the animation and the storyline (I am very into earth-based spirituality) and my sister loved the characters, especially the little Kodamas (tree-spirits)<br />If you're looking for a serious, inspirational animated movie, then look no further. Princess Mononoke is all that and much much more. I'm glad I &quot;forced&quot; myself to watch it that one time, otherwise I would have missed out on one of the greatest movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing.
B00005B36H|5.0|Some people are H U G E Tool fans, I'm more of just a casual fan of the band. I only owned \\"Undertow\\"..and had borrowed Aenima from friends..never heard Opiate. When I bought this album, I thought it (...) (it dont to me now though!  I'm gonna get to the point of this: for this album I think it's Black and White (1 & 2) if you're gonna like it or not:<br />1-You'll like this album if you're into albums that follow a sort of themed/mellow (with a few punches) music, or sort of spacey intricate guitar albums. <br />2-You'll think this album (...) if you're more into aggressive, in your face metal/rock. <br />I'm a fan of both and I finally am starting to like this album a lot man. It took a while to catch it. I like heavier music than this for the most part, but trust me when I say this album is talent-filled..it's real trippy...check it out definitley.
B00004Z459|5.0|this cd is was a great buy. I love all the songs on this cd. I'm not the biggest fan of heavy metal, but I must say that the lead singer is a total hottie!
B000002AZ8|5.0|It's a RAW, thick album with great emotion and strength..awesome-awesome songs.  Tremor Christ, Immortality, Not For You, Better Man...the whole thing is cool.  The artwork is pretty rad..really you'll like it.  <br />Vitalogy is &quot;my album&quot;...I have too much tied to it to even be able to write a proper review of it here, or anywhere.  The songs are just awesome..I think this is where Pearl Jam really found 'their sound' and touched into some darkness.  <br />What I can tell you is that I don't have sucky musical tastes, and if I've made this album &quot;my album&quot; I'm betting you'll be able to enjoy it if you're at least curious about it, which you must be if you're reading this.
0345451325|4.0|Written as a prequel to the upcoming Xbox game, Halo, you couldn't ask for a better source of background and timeline information with this book. The book borrows heavily from information known about the game, but everything is a completely original story. For example, the same enemy types that appear in Halo are frequently mentioned in the book, which gives a more profound sense of &quot;constant struggle&quot; between the human race and the deadly and ruthless alien species known as the Covenant. I feel this will really make the game an even more immersive experience; by reading this book, you're getting to know a lot of information that you otherwise wouldn't know while playing the game. Caught on a plotline twist or snag? Maybe if you read the book you would understand it a bit more. <br />        The book itself is very well written, and it keeps you immersed in the story page-to-page. The only thing I can really criticize is the fact that some action sequences can get a little repetitive and drawn-out (such as space battles between the humans and the Covenant). It's not enough to make you want to stop reading, though.<br />        I got this book Friday (Nov. 2nd), and finished it Sunday night (Nov. 4th), and it's well over 300 pages. That's how good it is. Of course, you may not be quite as interested in the story if you're not anticipating the game - but if you are, this is a definite must-read. I'd suggest to anyone who is looking for the best Halo experience on Xbox come Nov. 15th, get this book as soon as possible, and read the entire thing through before starting the game. I doubt a whole lot from the book will leak into the game, but you never know.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I want everyone who reads this to know from the beginning, that I am not a full fledged Britney fan, nor am I a hater, so this review is totally unbiased.  I'm an all around music listener but can be very picky with what I go out and buy, which was the reason why I was totally skeptical on buying a Britney album.  Well, I got it today and I must say I am not disappointed. This album is exactly showcasing what Britney is so good at making us do- dance.  It shows how her interest as a performer has changed from aching for love to going out and finding love on her own terms-the dance floor.  Here's the run down:<BR>1. I'm a Slave for You: Very exotic and totally groove worthy.  But since I've heard it one too many times b4 even buying this album, I skip it. <BR>2.Overprotected: Very in your face song with a decent message.  Makes you want to dance-of course.<BR>3.Lonely: Great production with this song.  Reminds you of her Stronger song.<BR>4.I'm not a girl, not yet a women: Kind of cheesy to me.  It's cute for the first few seconds, but let's face it, Britney's strong suite are not her slow songs. Sorry...<BR>5.Boys: Very sexy song. Reminds you of Janet's Nasty Boys. <BR>6.Anticipating: Very 60's feel to it. Once again reminds me of a Janet song I've heard. I like it though.<BR>7.I love rock n' roll: Remake of an already great song so it's decent. <BR>8.Cinderella: I'm not clear on the true topic of the song. I'm thinking it's another no nonsense song on unbalanced relationships.<BR>9.Let Me Be: Great opening words. I like the song's beat.<BR>10.Bombastic Love: Cutest song on the cd!! It's kind of a guilty pleasure like Lucky was.<BR>11.That's where you take me: Cute. Doesn't do much for me though.<BR>12. What it's like to be me: I know Justin is her b/f, but for that reason alone she should be able to tell him 'no' when it comes to her work.  This is the worst song on the album. The vocal arrangement s.... and the beat sounds confused.<BR> All in all the cd is all about dancing.  If you want to have a fun time pop in this album. But don't look for anything deep, b/c Britney still lackes in the depth department.  Her voice has gotten better though, it's similar to Gwen Stefani.  I recommend the cd.
0743420373|4.0|Although the book got really repetitive towards the end and it had a mound of statistics piled up, it was still an overall good read. This book emphasized its main points effectively by creating hypothetical situations. It gave me a better understanding of how millionaires act. Most of the habits that these millionaires follow are common sense but it all comes down to whether or not a person wants to make sacrifices. The book does a really good job of listing these &quot;millioniare habits&quot;.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album totally rocks!! It's the best rap album of all time. Every song included, in my opinion are masterpieces. The use of explicit language I think in a twisted way are quite sexy and also very touching. This is due to relating to his issues on depression and sucide which are illnesses I've been going through lately. I also like this album because it's not a goody goody two shoes type like backstreet boys, which I find not as addictive to listen. All and All as long as you don't winge about explicit language, buying this album is a must!!!
0743420373|4.0|After reading this book, I have decided that I will put a halt on any unnecessary shopping sprees. Instead of saving to buy the car of my dreams, I will invest that money or most likely put it in the bank, seeing how the economy is not doing too well. The strongest message that I got from the book was to live below your means. Buying used instead of new, timing your showers to exactly three minutes to save money on the water bill...ok maybe that's a little too much but according to the two PhD authors, you need to be frugal.<BR>Although the book got really repetitive towards the end and it had a mound of statistics piled up, it was still an overall good read. I would recommend it to anyone that has dreams about becoming a millionaire.
B00005QDW5|4.0|~i just bought this album today.. november 6th, Cause I'm the biggest floyd fan ever,,,<br /> and... this album is very good... But it's not the best of pink floyd...<br /> Please... you should buy every other floyd album there is instead of buying this one.. although &quot;When the tiggers broke free&quot; you'll only find it in &quot;the wall&quot; the move.<BR> I think that about 6 songs should not be in this album , like the early stuff and the new stuff... Cause let's bu honest... the best pink flod was , the~~ &quot;Waters&quot; pink floyd...<BR> i hated the fact that &quot;echoes&quot; was edited... it's still a great song... but I can't stand the fact that you can never find in copilation cd's the full masterpieces of &quot;echoes&quot; and &quot;shine on&quot;<BR> But like I said , you should buy the whole collection...<br /> But f you can't afford it... then yes... this is a good cd. IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE REST... AT LEAST FROM MEDDLE TO THE FINAL CUT<br /> oh... Roger Waters &quot;In the Flesh&quot; it's much , much better.. you~~ should get that.~
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek was an enjoyable fantasy adventure that will appeal to adults as well as children. <BR>I watched it with my nephew and enjoyed it more than he did.<BR>It was very funny and very well animated. The extras on the DVD are worth the purchase alone. There are games to play, documentaries on how the movie was made and a nice sing a long karoke feature. Hats off to the voice actors and especially Eddie Murphy who was great as the donkey.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Hey everyone! My first review and I 'm using it to tell every how to remove sticker glue. If you happened to take the entire sticker off of the DVD of Shrek, fear not. Just take something else with a sticky back,(like another sticker) and place it on the glue, and pull on the sticker. Do it as many times as you have to. It works great. It will be smooth and glossy. The only thing you`ll have left is the square indent from the original sticker. By the way, Shrek was a very funny movie, I recommend it! Go rent it or buy it! Bye!
B000002NC4|5.0|Perfect from Now On consists of 8 tracks, each being 5-8 minutes epics in their own right. It's incredible how well these songs are crafted, it really is. Each has its own transitions into complex guitar rhythms that will play in your heads for days on end. Doug Martsch is a guitar god. <BR>  Perfect From Now On is one of the top recordings of the nineties. Highly recommended. 10/10
B00005CDNI|4.0|Beginning to move beyond dance music, yet with great offerings in that genre, this album has a precursor or two to marvelous things to come.  Dance fans will love &quot;Angeleyes,&quot; while those who enjoy the rich pop tradition of Abba will not be disappointed.  The tongue-in-cheek &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; is a comic romp with a classic Andersson/Ulvaeus hook.  The anthemic &quot;Chiquitita&quot; is a timeless classic with unlimited potential to stir the heart, as is the closer, &quot;Kisses of Fire.&quot;  A worthy addition to any pop collection.
B000002R48|4.0|This cd has some great playing on it. This one sounds more like early metal than other DT albums. The sound quality is pretty bad. It is however, early DT and a must have for curious people like me. This is easily there worst album but that don't mean a whole lot because their other albums are so far ahead of every thing else out there.
B00005CDNK|5.0|Its immediate predecessor, this album definitely hints at the absolute genius which will create &quot;The Album.&quot;  This, too, is a sonic journey that the listener will want to take again and again.  While the concept of &quot;filler music&quot; is not uncommon in the industry, appearing on the works of many artists, it seems all but unknown to Andersson and Ulvaeus, especially when considering this outing and the one to follow.  From the title track to the closer, &quot;Like an Angel Passing Through my Room,&quot; one is compelled to set all other matters aside and give full attention to the aural experience.  This album is a must-have for any lover of great contemporary music.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Even if you have every single album PF has put out over the past 30 years, it's nice to get one that encompasses their entire career. The sound quality is excellent, too! No gaps between songs is something you rarely hear today. More concept than vehicle for singles....
B00005CDNK|5.0|In my review of this album I have it out of sequence.  It did not precede &quot;The Album&quot;; rather, it followed it.  Please forgive the error.
0920668372|1.0|Somebody should write an essay on why this book draws such extreme reactions, pro and con, from adult readers. When my daughter was born, three different people (all of whom I respect) gave me the book and raved about it, as did other parents I know. I thought both the text and illustrations were mawkish, plus it left me feeling a bit queasy, so I never read it to my child. Given its wide acclaim, I figured there was something wrong with me until my daughter's first Nanny (the best since Mary Poppins) said it gave her the creeps too. My question is, why are there no in-between reactions?
B00003ZA27|5.0|Dr. Armando speaks wisely.  We have here some of the most spiritually profound music ever created.  To impose dogmatic attitudes upon great conductors, their respective musical eras &amp; their interpretations is tantamount to asking if they are Roman Catholic, Lutheran, or Jewish (Bach was Lutheran). Great recordings co-exist; they do not supercede or negate each other.  In this kind of music, I want conductors to express what is in their hearts.
0393312836|4.0|This story is tells the story of Alex, the main character and narrator of the story.  Alex and his three droogs, friends, Pete, Dim, and Georgie were a horror for the town that they lived in with their ultraviolent ways.  They go around stealing, beating, and raping whomever and whenever they please.  One day on a regular night Alex and his droogs broke into a house and beat a women to death.  As the four were about to make their getaway, Dim, Pete, and Georgie turn on him and knock him down cold.  The police took him in and sent him to a state jail for murder.  While he was there he made some changes for the better and was picked to be in an experiment to rehabilitate convicts.  They give him medicine and make him watch horrifying movies of crimes of all sorts.  Whenever he has an urge for violence, he receives an excruciating sickness to his stomach.  When this experiment was through, they send Alex into the world.  How will the young man last in a harsh world when he can't fight back?  The results are all too shocking.<BR>      A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess is a spectacular piece of fiction.  This well thought out piece of work is one of a kind.  It is one of the most interesting books of it's time for the author, Burgess, writes this book in the teenage language of the future, nadsat as they call it.  In this futuristic tale, the main conflict is between good and evil and the freedom of choice.  Alex must choose to continue his life of evil or to switch to the side of good.  Saw the movie?  Think you know the story?  Think again because this version contains the lost twenty-first chapter that was never before published in the United States.  This ending changes the meaning of the whole book.
B00004ZDOO|4.0|I've just recently bought &quot;Chocolate Starfish...&quot; and would recommend that you buy Signifigant Other first to see if you like Limp Bizkits style of rock, but if you already like Limp Bizkit, add this CD to your collection.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I absolutely love Britney Spears.  There hasn't been a female artist this fun to watch since Madonna.  All the songs on this new album are fun to listen to, dance to, or sing along to in your car.  The first single &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; is already a classic.  Britney can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned.  If you are a Britney fan, this is a must have album.  Even my friends who don't typically like Britney's music say that they love the songs on this cd.
6305627401|5.0|I've been a South Park fan for a long time and when I heard they were making a South Park movie back in 1999 I thought it would be a disappointment but it was anything but.This movie is the funniest ever it's even funnier than Scary Movie.Its full of bad language rasist remarks and much more, the movie follows the show well and even if you never seen the show it's still easy to understand.It's about stan,kyle,cartman and kenny sneaking into a R rated movie.When they start to swear in class mr macky phones there parents then the parents find out it was a canadian film and later declare war on Canada.I must have enjoyed this more because I've seen Trey and Matts earlier films and enjoyed them very much and this one seams simular.All in all this is a very funny movie that has some really good songs in between.Fan of South Park will not be disappointed with this movie.Too bad the DVD does'nt have any good features besides the trailers.
B00005LKIM|2.0|I am a huge &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (SOTL) fan and was very disappionted when I learned the Jodi Foster would not be coming back to play Clarice in the sequal.  I just knew this was going to be a great movie.  I have not read the book so I had no idea what the story line would be.  To say that the sequal was a let-down is an understatement.  What was so great about SOTL, was the intriguing relationship between Clarice and Dr. Lector.  The movie was suspensful and the story line kept you on the edge of your seat.  After seeing this movie I understood completely why Jodi Foster did not replay her role as Clarice.  Hannibal is an insult to the first movie.  SOTL was a psychological thriller, Hannibal is nothing more than a disgusting Hollywood flop.  I love action movies and don't mind the scenes where the violence gets a little gory but this movie is just gross.....VERY GROSS. The last 20 minutes of the movie are so gross that I had a hard time watching it and had to look away during some parts of it.  The awesome personality of Dr. Lector in the first movie is not present in this one.  Most of his scenes in the movie are him doing something disgusting.  The second book was written for the sole purpose of making money.  The plot is horrible....I'm sorry that I saw the movie.
B0000024SI|5.0|This is the cd that got me on the Bob Dylan craze. After lisntening I immeditely became a disciple of his. This cd is great from start to finish.  All the songs are 5 star with the exception of it takes a train to laugh which is a 4star song.  People say that Dylans voice is bad, but it sounds great on highway 61.  This cd is a great place to start for Bob because you will see how cool he is, then go on to Essential BobDylan or biograph.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I am proud of the girl for taking chances and changes things up a bit...everyone has to realize that she will be 20 years old very soon and she must expand as an artist. I loved her the minute a heard and saw her. But i am surprised at some of the reviews i have already read. They were so negative. I think she has done an awesome job. 98% of this album is the britney we are supposed to know. And i think this is the best her voice has ever sounded!<BR>LOVE YA BRIT. Keep on Rocking!<br />Kelly from VA!!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Subtle humor appeals to the adults, not-too-subtle &quot;potty humor&quot; to appeal to the older children and a timeless story about a princess in distress, although with a bit of a twist.  Overall, a fun movie, one oyu can watch over &amp; over again.
B00005QDW5|2.0|A Best Of by Pink Floyd, as lovely as it is to get all their &quot;best songs&quot; into two discs, just doesn't work, especially when the songs are out of chronological order; instead of fading in and out nicely, the compilation ends up being something like the jumbled blocks of a bad Tetris player, so the effects of the songs are different than from the original albums. The only good thing about this compilation is the artwork. If you don't have any Floyd albums Dark Side of the Moon will suffice just as good or even better.
B00005N83M|5.0|I bought this because I'd had the &quot;I'm Real&quot; remix in my head for days, but now I'm extremely happy to own it. Everything from the radio favorites &quot;I'm Real&quot;, &quot;Play&quot;, and &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot; to new greats like &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;. I highly recomend this CD!!!
B00004U8P9|5.0|wow. this definitely has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. the simple fact that ive seen it a virtually countless amount of times both live and at home yet it is still a movie that attracts my absolute attention whenever its playing stands out in my mind as great. its hard to believe that this movie is 25 years old and still holds its impact so much more than when it was released. but as for this DVD edition.... ITS ABOUT TIME! i found out when it was to be released and i had my schedule memorized with &quot;buy rocky dvd....... buy rocky dvd...&quot; and all the special features included are great! definitely a keeper! even if you've never experienced the live show this is the 2nd best way to watch this movie! BUY IT!
B000050XEI|5.0|After the tragic events of Spetmeber 11th, the best comfort is to curl up with a great CD -- and this fits the bill. &quot;Only Time&quot; and &quot;Lazy Days&quot; are enough to get your mind off your problems if only for a little bit. I highly recommend this to anyone.
6303965415|5.0|I happened upon this wonderful adaptation of &quot;Persuasion&quot; while<BR>...I stopped and watched...at the end I wanted to see it again because I wanted to understand what was going on much better. I have watched it over and over again enjoying it ever so much each time, seeing and understanding what was said and what was going on...To appreciate this wonderful love story you have to watch it more than once.  So much is lost in looks, glances, words spoken and in plot if viewed only once and without patience and the subtitles to help with the English accents. I enjoyed all the actors involved from dear,sweet lamenting Anne, our evolving heroine to the charming,stirring Captain Wentworth's reawakening love for her; the fun Admiral Croft and wife Sophie; the funny quirks and interaction between sister Mary, her husband and his family;the self-absorbed snobbery of Anne's father and sister;the subplots of Mr. Elliot, Mrs. Clay, Mrs Smith, Captain Hargrove and Bennick, and the wonderful sailing off into the sunset ending....one of my favorite movies to watch over again.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Admittedly, I mainly purcahsed this to keep my Britney collection complete, but there are  some pretty great songs on it. Her version of &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot; is a true tribute to the classic and even the couple co-written by Britney herself were worth listening to. I'll be the first to say the girl needs to learn to wear clothes, but there's no denying her ability to sing and entertain.
B000003BEV|3.0|De aqu se desprende el apodo que le dan a los Stones.  No es un disco que te va a encantar la primera vez que lo escuches, por el contrario, debers escucharlo una y otra vez hasta que finalmente tu oido se adpate a l y termine por gustarte. Es un disco que no tiene nada que ver con las otras grabaciones de los Stones (si no fuera por la voz inconfundible de Mick Jagger, nunca te inmaginarias que pertenece a los Rolling).  Sin embargo, contiene buenas canciones: &quot;Citadel&quot; (la que ms se acerca al sonido Stones), &quot;She is a Rainbow&quot; con muy buen arreglo musical, &quot;2000 man&quot; y la mas psicodelica de todas &quot;2000 lights years from home&quot;.  Si eres no eres un verdadero seguidor de los Stones, no es un disco para ti.
B00005OM4N|4.0|What a great album by the Queen of Pop! Some of the tracks are not her best, but some of her best are on this very cd. Here's a rundown of each song:<br />I'm a Slave 4 U- A good song with racy lyrics. LOVE the dance breaks.<BR>Overprotected- My favorite song on the album. It's got great beats, lyrics, and sounds like a club song. Like nothing of hers I have heard before. <BR>Lonely- Sounds almost like a mix between Janet and a REALLY angry Jessica Simpson. Not a bad song, though. <BR>I'm Not a Girl...- A little too breathy for my tastes, but the lyrics and the music are great, by pop genius Max Martin. <BR>Boys- Starts out like a mix between &quot;Slave&quot; and &quot;Independant Women&quot;, but turns into a almost a club song. <BR>Anticpating- Sounds almost like the &quot;I'm Coming Out&quot; song from those belly button commercials. A little TOO pop for Britney to be singing. <BR>I Love Rock 'n' Roll- Remake of the Joan Jett hit, and although not as good as the original, MUCH better than Britney's remake of  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.<BR>Cinderella- Sounds like a Prince song. Doesn't suit Britney well AT ALL. <BR>Let Me Be- Basic Britney song. Breathy and pop-py. From the On the Line soundtrack. <BR>Bombastic Love- ANOTHER basic Britney song. <BR>That's Where You Take Me- A fast but slow song. Not very good either. <BR>What It's Like To Be Me- Sounds like an *NSYNC song, which makes it perfect, because Justin and Wade wrote and produced it. Not saying it isn't any good, it just sounds like Justin and JC should be singing it. <br />Overall, there were only 1-2 slow songs, which I was SO happy about because I hate slow songs. It's a great dancing and party album. &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; are some of the best and most original work that she has done. The CD is enhanced with a neat clipping video from Britney's new movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; to the background music of &quot;Overprotected&quot;.
B00004THAY|5.0|Eric Clapton vuelve a lo que mas sabe hacer: BLUES, y nada menos que con otro genio B.B King.  Altamente recomendado para aquellas personas amante del genero (y para los que no lo son tambin).  Simplemente escucha &quot;Riding With the King&quot; y entenderas por que te lo digo.
B00003CX8J|1.0|Totally overblown hype caused  me to spend my money on this plotless waste of a movie. I'll learn one day. A comic book plot does not a good movie make.
B000002MFE|4.0|Es un buen disco, pero particularmente no con la dimensin que otras personas le dan, un disco un poco ligero (creo que por la esencia del Unplugged).  El disco comienza con una instrumental &quot;Signe&quot; bastante buena, &quot;Before you Acuse me&quot; es muy buena tambin, pero nada comparable con la versin elctrica, el mismo comentario para la famosa &quot;Layla&quot;.  De &quot;tears in heaven&quot; para que hablar, la debes haber escuchado miles de veces.  A mi parecer lo mas destacable del disco es &quot;Rollin' and tumblin'&quot;.  Si eres fantico del Blues y de Clapton lo debes tener, no porque el disco sea una obra maestra, sino porque aqui queda demostrado la clase de musico que este genio y tambin por tener algo fuera de lo comun.
B00000K19E|5.0|That's what this movie gives but it's not mindless action like some other movies use to try to entertain us with. It had a well thought out plot and credible acting. The action sequences are ingenious and totally awesome! Loved it! Keanu Reeves did alright too.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Tan solo con escuchar &quot;Texas Flood&quot; caeras en cuenta porque Stevie fue considerado como uno de los dioses de la guitarra, no he escuchado un Blues que me haya impactado tanto como este, que manera de tocar!!.  Sin desperdicio alguno, mencin aparte las canciones extras en vivo que trae, y notaras que su manera de tocar no son trucos de estudio, es que verdaderamente era un genio de las seis cuerdas.  Contiene tres canciones instrumentales: &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Rude Mood&quot;, una pieza maestra, es una cancin obligada cada vez que escucho a Stevie, la otra &quot;Dirty Pool&quot; un poco ms relajada, pero excelente.  Si nunca le prestaste atencin a la carrera de Stevie Ray, pues comprate este disco, y ya te ver de nuevo buscando nuevas cosas de l. Por que te lo digo?, yo fui uno de ellos!!!!
B00003CX5P|2.0|After seeing the first Star Wars, then the next two installments I must say I was really let down by this movie. Lots of special effects but no clear plot really left me wondering why I even bothered. Plus there were so many things going on, I felt overloaded with information but couldn't figure out what it applied to. This is only for the die hard Star Wars fans.
B000003BE4|5.0|Definitivamente el mejor disco de los Stones hasta &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, con un tracklisting fenomenal.  Que mejor comienzo que &quot;Mercy Mercy&quot; , incluida en varias recopilaciones de los Stones de los 60s, una verdadera lstima que no la hayan tocado casi nunca en vivo (solo en el concierto del Hyde Park del 69 despues del fallecimiento de Brian Jones).  &quot;The last Time&quot; todo un clsico, opacado un poco por la presencia de &quot;(I Cant get no) Satisfaction&quot; (no creo que haga falta hablar de esta cancin). &quot;The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man&quot; demasiado subvaluada, no aparece casi en ninguna parte salvo en &quot;Singles collection, The London Years&quot;, pero definitivamente es una gran cancin (de mis favoritas de esa poca.  Cuando la escuches opinars lo mismo).  &quot;Play With Fire&quot;, muy sencilla prcticamente con pura guitarra acstica, una genialidad.  &quot;The Spider And The Fly&quot;, lo ms seguro es que te suene por estar incluidad dentro del &quot;Stripped&quot;, totalmente diferente, aunque con la misma esencia de Blues.  &quot;One More Try&quot; de menos de 2 minutos de duracin, pero muy buena.  &quot;Im All right&quot; la cual es en vivo.  Definitivamente un disco para todos los amantes de esta banda y del Rock And Roll.  El ttulo te lo dice todo...cuidado si no quedas igual!!
B00005QDW5|2.0|Oh, it's just another collection of songs that were not on other, previous collections.<BR>Now Dogs and Pigs stood in the basket and they grabbed out Sheep.<BR>On the Turning Away has gone but High Hopes and Learning 2 Fly arrived!<BR>Brain Damage and Eclipse had no place here so Us and Them and A Great Gig In The Sky were put on instead.<BR>No, this is ain't a best of, this is a collection of songs from a great band.<BR>I gave 2 stars because it is Pink Floyd.
B000000W5N|5.0|Es un disco obligado para los seguidores de los Stones.  Es de l epoca ms fructifera de la mejor banda del Rock and Roll que ha existido y existir en el mundo entero.  Otros discos obligatorios &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;, &quot;Get Yer...&quot;, &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; y &quot;Exile On Main St&quot;.  Apenas comienza a rodar el disco, te encuentras con &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; (clsico entre los clsicos), con esa introduccin fenomenal de Keith en la guitarra y de pronto ya tienes una sonrisa pintada en el rostro, la cual no se te quitar hasta tanto no dejes de escuchar el disco. &quot;Wild Horses&quot; una obra de arte, &quot;Cant You Hear me knocking?&quot; una de las piezas mas subvaloradas de los Stones, de mas de siete minutos de duracin, con una mitad instrumental muy Jazz; una verdadera joya (todavia no me explico como no la incluyen en sus giras y en los recopilatorios). &quot;You got to move&quot; del blues mas primitivo con Mick Taylor haciendo maravillas con el Slide. Si no lo tienes, compralo, tu dinero no estar mal gastado, al contrario tienes tremenda inversion.
B00005LKIM|3.0|This is just what a sequel does after the original movie comes out and does so well. I saw this here in town and I can honestly say this is not up to par.  Hopkins should have known what Foster did and turned this down. The ending is a waste of everyone's talent!  The beginning was good.
0871137380|5.0|A true story about modern war  This book is so great I want to read it again!  Without saying so much, I really am intrigued about the plot in this first-rate book!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think her album is wonderful. She is a very talented person, and I wish her all the success in the world.. I know she will be around for a very long time..  I listened to the entire CD and I loved every song. Great Job!!!!
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is one of the, if not the, best book I have read in my short 16 years of life.  Vonnegut tells the story of a man, unstruck in time, who travels spasmodically back and forth through time, reliving past experiences.  It is enjoyable by fans of all genre: the bombing of dresden for you historical buffs, an alien abduction for you sci fi nuts, and hilarious dialogue and actions for the comedy fans.  <BR>     As well as telling an incredably good story, it also informs the reader of an event in history that few know about, despite it's impact on the war, and the amount of casulties it caused.  So not only are you reading a fine example of writing, you're also learning history too, now you just can't beat that with a stick.  All in all, Slaughterhouse Five is a modern masterpiece, and rightfully deserves it's spot on the &quot;Modern Library's 100 Best Books of the Century&quot; (#18) as well as more.  I whole heartedly recommend next time you are shopping for books at your local bookstore, you check this one out, it won't disappoint.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I have been anticipating this DVD for several years and I'm thrilled it's finally available.  I have to admit, however, that the remastering of the picture, to me, is below par on many levels.  For one thing, there are COUNTLESS artifacts, scrapes, scratches, etc. on the picture throughout.  For another thing, they fixed SOME of the special effects, but some of the most blatantly flawed effects from the original remain.  A quick glance at the shots during Kirk's tour around the outside of the Enterprise starts out with shots of the space station orbiting the Earth, and the shuttle with Kirk and Scotty is horribly matted (as it has always been), with horrendous matte lines that could have easily been cleaned up.<br />The sound, however, is very good, and the movie does seem to play better as far as pacing is concerned.<br />But I'm still very bothered by Paramount's rather slipshod handling of this movie, with only half of the effects being enhanced or fixed, and with (in my opinion) one of the worst marketing campaigns for a major release in recent memory.  They did so well with the Godfather set.  What happened here?
B000001IPL|3.0|Short and sweet, this album contains a lot of good songs.  My only complaint: they are all very similar.  The repeating power chords in the same basic format for each song gets a little tiresome.  Don't get me wrong, I like the style, but when buying this album, I felt like I paid (...)the dollars for one or two songs.<br />The basic song format (Opening riff, then Chorus, then interlude, then Chorus, then Closer) has worked very well for the Offspring up to this point, but it does get a little mundane.<br />My advice:<BR>1. Download a couple songs from an FTP site instead of buying the whole CD<BR>2. Try buying some of Offspring's earlier works.  You can't go wrong with \\"Americana\\"
B00005MP58|1.0|The recently-released &quot;Special Edition&quot; is obviously a quickly-transferred digital dub of the original film for the sole purpose of anamorphic viewing.  BUT THE COLOR QUALITY IS ATROCIOUS!  The print is completely washed-out in terms of color - nothing compared to the original DVD.
B00005OM4N|2.0|I received a leaked copy of this album and was very disappointed with it. Other than the single &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;, I really only liked a couple of the songs. I am a fan of pop music, but I'm just not feeling this album. There's very little substance, just more nonsensical video friendly spewing. &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; is an interesting choice for a cover, and it works well in this case. I also like the song &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, which features great production. Overall this album is more of the same, so I can only recommend it to people who already like Brintey Spears.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's junior album, follow up to &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; turned out really nice!!!<br />This cd seems to relate more to her personal experiances more than ever.  Here's a song by song review.<br />1)  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;~this one doesn't have a defined <BR>    chorus...It takes a little while to actually get into and <BR>    understand this song...over-all though, they were correct   <BR>    for picking this song as the first single..this song is the <BR>    Britney's new sound.  I'll give it a B-, only because I <BR>    think they were very brave to even create this tune.<br />2)  &quot;Overprotected&quot;~If anyone can't relate to this song, I <BR>    don't know what the problem is,  I know Britney wrote this <BR>    song about her life...but just about any teenager can <BR>    relate.  Not a bad chorus, kinda sounds like the new N'Sync <BR>    cd...&quot;Celebrity&quot;  C+<br />3)  &quot;Lonely&quot;~Britney's voice sounds really cool on &quot;Lonely&quot;...<BR>    this track has more of an edgier, rock sound to it...almost <BR>    another N'Sync sounding song...what's wrong with that <BR>    though??  I certainly don't mind!  I'll give this one a B- <BR>    for Britney trying something new like this.<br />4)  &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;~WOW!!!!  This one should <BR>    ride the top of the charts for at least a couple of weeks!! <BR>    the charts.  I love this ballad!  This one shows off Brit's <BR>    voice....the video should be awesome!  I'm proud of the <BR>    writers and her for this song!!!  It should do really well.<BR>    A++++!!!<br />5)  &quot;Boys&quot;~if this isn't a &quot;tease&quot; I don't know what is...LOL  <BR>    I enjoy this one though...well written!  B  (I love Britney's<BR>    laugh in this one)---ooohh it's nice...LOL<br />6)  &quot;Anticipating&quot;~I love the music to this one!!!  Disco is <BR>    back!-LOL  This one makes me feel good!  I love the <BR>    instruments used in it also...workedreally well!!!  A- <br />7)  &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot;~I've only heard the original song a <BR>    couple of times...but I like Britney's song...edgy, rock <BR>    feeling once again.  Good background vocals on this one.  <BR>    I'll give it a B- just because it's a good remake of the <BR>    song.<br />8)  &quot;Cinderella&quot;~some people would say this is just another one <BR>    of those songs to fill up the album...I don't think so..<BR>    nice production,  I wish they'd put this one on the radio..<BR>    It's kinda fun...nice chorus...you can tell this is a Max <BR>    Martin song..this is just a cool sounding song...I love it!!!<BR>    B+<br />9)  &quot;Let Me Be&quot;~well...this has a good little tune, but..this is <BR>    one of those &quot;fill-up-the-album&quot; songs..C-<br />10) &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;~awesome opening!!!  This one would do well<BR>    in her concerts...I hope she's performing this one!!!  They <BR>    could do a good production with it!  C-<br />11) &quot;That's Were You Take Me&quot;~I love this one!!!  Such a smooth<BR>    flowing song,...this one makes ya feel good inside!  I like <BR>    the way Britney sounds in this one...lol, she sounds like <BR>    a little baby in some parts...on the background vocals..I <BR>    could listen to this one over and over again!!  A+  a very <BR>    enjoyable song!<br />12) &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;~pretty good....Justin and Britney<BR>    actually came up with a cool song...not bad for their first <BR>    try.  I'll give it a C+++++++  (Justin had pretty good   <BR>    vocals)<br />Overall...I think Britney did really well...I'm just dissapointed that the album is only 39 minutes and 42 seconds long... they should of added about 4 more songs...I wish they would stop releasing so many songs oversees!!  That only makes us fans go out and spend more money...I know it's not Brit's fault...but whoever is making these decisions, they should think about her fans first and foremost!!!  We deserve more than 12 songs an album!!!!<br />I'll give this album a flat out A!  No plus or minus.  I think she did pretty well!  WHO CARES ABOUT WHAT SHE'S TRYING TO SAY!  Just listen to the music and have fun!  STOP COMPLAINING!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|First off, I'm going to say that my opinion is not biased..I'm not a huge Brit fan, but I like her.  I thought I wouldn't be able to enjoy her music again..until this album.  It's filled with catchy uptempos..there's only two ballads that I can think of, which is I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman and That's Where You Take Me.  Some of the high points of this album is I'm A Slave 4 U, which is her first hit from this album, Boys, Overprotected..and that's just to name a few! There's even a track where Brit pairs up with someone who I'm sure everyone would love a chance to sing with, Justin Timberlake..it's called What It's Like To Be Me..I'm not an N'Sync fan at all, but I still found the song to be enjoyable.  Their voices blend well together.  She does her own version of a classic, I Love Rock 'n' Roll, and I must say, she did a pretty good job with that.  Out of all her albums, this one is a definite improvement.  And she even contributes her own material this time around.  Don't listen to the bad reviews that you have read, giving this gem two stars.  This is something that you should have in your collection, even if you are not a Brit fan, I'm sure you could find something that catches your listening attention here.To me, this was worth every cent and I haven't been able to stop listening! I gave it four stars because it's not perfect, but it sure is pretty close! Check it out for yourself, it's worth it!
B00005JKHP|4.0|Well this certainly is a feature packed DVD with loads of extras and in general good image quality except that while watching the movie I noticed one really big problem.  Occasionally I noticed that some of the camera cuts on this DVD seemed to have this odd shearing-effect instead of a nice solid cut.  I thought this might have all been in my head until i tried pausing it, then frame by frame advancing the film.. and sure enough.. you can see Telecine interlace problems, where you will see 2 images from 2 different shots combined together in this ugly sheared interlaced mess.  The strange thing is, my TV isn't even a progressive scan TV, but a normal NTSC interlace TV.  Whoever did the Inverse telecine for this DVD didn't do a very good job.  The problem is very distracting.  If you don't believe me.. check out the shot at56min and 26 seconds into the film, there is a cut to Bones right after Jim says &quot;On my way&quot;... pause it there and frame by frame advance it the actual cut and you'll see what I mean.  There are multiple telecine errors in this DVD just like this.
B000002C4J|5.0|&quot;Let's talk about love&quot; is not Celine's best album to date, because that should be &quot;Falling into you&quot;, but it contains what may be named the best song of the decade...Why Sony Music refused to release &quot;To love you more&quot;, knowing that the song broke all the records in the Japanese market, where still is the most succesful song in music history?<BR>&quot;To love you more&quot; spent an amazing record 24 weeks at number 1 in Japanese's Pop 100 singles, and also spent 16 weeks at number 1 in Billboard's Adult Contemporany charts, but wasnt released as a comercial single. I think that its beautiful lyrics, the spectacular orchestra arragements, following by the magnificen and unforgettable end of the song, makes that song Celine's best song to date and one of the best songs in music history
B00005OM4N|4.0|I bought this cd out of curiousity.  I do have her other cds, but was unsure if i was gonna buy this one.  I like &quot;I'm a slave for you, it has a tight beat.  I do find some of her songs catchy, as always.  She doesn't have the greatest voice, but she makes do with what she has.  I could relate to some of her songs though.  &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Not a girl, not yet a woman&quot;.  Umm, it's pretty good, at least i think so.  oh yeah, in the last song, you could hear Justin from *NSYNC in the background.  If you want some music to listen to, or dance to, go ahead and buy this album. :)
0783230621|4.0|The only disappointment about this DVD is that the inside sleeve with the menu chapters states that it is a two sided disc with loads of extra features on it. It is not!!!!
B00005QDW5|5.0|At first I was skeptic about buying this CD since I had all the songs on the Cd on other Cd's.  I went out and bought it anyway.  I haven't regretted doing so.  If you are any kind of Pink Floyd fan you need to have this CD.  It is very well put together.  The tracks fading into each other is really cool. A++
B00005OM4N|4.0|This new Cd is jammin with tunes ! My favorite one ? &quot;I'm a slave for you&quot;. No wonder it's so good. It's at no. 3 at my local radio station:B93.7. If you, like me, like her no. one song, I would suggest you buy the single. The new Madonna is coming !
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's new CD is definitely worth a listen. If you've never liked her before, I think that this CD will change your opinion. This new CD is def not for 9 year old girls, like her previous ones. If you compare the sounds of the previous albums to this one, you will notice a more mature sound. This album is more sexual (a lot more hehe), and aggressive. This album is also, well, not deep, but much deeper than the previous ones. The gorgeous ballad &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; Britney is able to handle really well, and the cover to the classic song &quot;I Love Rock-n-Roll&quot; is one of the best tracks on the entire CD, redone with a more modern sound, but retaining that classic sound, which makes it so irresistable. &quot;Boys,&quot; the 'child' of &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U,&quot; is one of the sexiest songs on the ablum, which really shows Britney's dark and sexy side, but somehow, she still remains innocent. &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Overprotected&quot; are probably the songs that I can relate to the most. Being a teenager, I know what it's like to be sheltered, and what Britney is communicating in the song. This album is definitely worth hearing, and I'm sure it will impact your opinion of Britney. For some people, a lot, and for others, not so much. :-)
B000006ED1|5.0|Being an avid listener of melodic heavy metal, bands such as In Flames, Soilwork, and Dark Tranquility; Blind Guardian was kind of risky, moving into very fast paced Medieval melodies.  All I can say is that it was worth the risk.  Blind Guardian will please anyone's ears.<br />Quick drum beats and killer guitar riffs, all combined with classical instruments and one hell of a singer will bring you into a land of which words do no justice.  Listening is the only way to experience the auora of Blind Guardian<br />If there is a single song that I would stake my taste in music on, it would have to be Mirror Mirror off of this album.  The song incorporates every human emotion into the few minutes the song runs.<br />Blind Guardian shall lead you on an aural journey throughout time, the listener will not be disappointed.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am big fan of Britney Spears.  However, I do not pretend that she is the BEST vocalist.  I am the first to admit that her voice needs some work.  But let's face it artists with just as much as--or even less--talent have had brilliant careers (i.e. Janet, Madonna and Cher).  Notwithstanding a somewhat limited vocal capability, &quot;Britney,&quot; the third LP from Britney Spears, is her best album to date.  Maybe becuase she has grown up, maybe because she co-wrote 5 of the 12 tracks or maybe just because she got a better choice of sounds to choose from.  But for whatever reason it is a fabulous disc.<BR>  The Neptune's produced lead track from the album, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U,&quot; is a wonderful R&amp;B infused pop gem.  Within Slave's scintillating non-traditional melody one can here echoes of Prince and Madonna.  Slave shows Britney on the threshold from adolescence to adulthood.  Like many of her fans she is demanding that we recongize that she is not the little girl and we need to, as a latter track demands, &quot;Let Her Be.&quot;<BR>  &quot;Boys&quot; and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; are dance-pop nuggets that push the sugar and spice image of the Britney of the past, while &quot;Anticipation,&quot;--a eletronic driven number--shows that Britney can handle any assortment of genres with more than acceptable levels of vocal ability.<BR>  Perhaps the biggest surprise on &quot;Britney&quot; is the wonderfull Dido co-written track &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman.&quot;  This song is a tremendous ballad that Britney has been needing and now has the ability to handle.  Here she is given the chance to show that her voice and range has grown from &quot;theatrical&quot; and deep and emtional.  She handles the track with flare and confidence that could make even the biggest Britney basher smile.<BR>  Britney has grown up and &quot;Britney&quot; shows her maturation.  Even the two or three so-called &quot;filler&quot; tracks are much better than what the Divas ofold have had.  While there is no clear cut killer pop single--save maybe &quot;Not Yet A Women&quot;--this is a truly satisfying disc.  &quot;Britney&quot; chronicles the journey of Britney from girl to woman and does it well.  While it may not be quite as big a step as Janet's &quot;Control,&quot; it is a good step towards a long successful career.
B00005R8FI|5.0|The blues harp playing and the ambience of the whole album makes this much nicer than your average 1970's blues rock.
0743216458|5.0|Ambrose's analysis of Easy Company is great for those who are leaders in miltary units, especially Company Grade Officers and NCO's.  Good professional reading as well as an entertaining story!  Definately a hard book to put down.
B00005JKHP|5.0|When I first learned many months ago, that Star Trek-The Motion Picture was finally going to be released on DVD, I was thrilled. When I had soon after discovered that the movie was receiving a huge face lift and edit from Robert Wise for the DVD release, I was elated.....<br />I don't think I have ever anticipated the release of any movie onto DVD as much as I have with ST-TMP. And, today was finally THE day! For me, it was a glorious moment.  I could not wait to watch this movie!<br />And now that I have watched it, I find it difficult to describe in words, how incredible this DVD really is!  It is nothing short of AWESOME...From start to finish, you are treated to a front row seat to the movie that we should have seen 22 years ago!  The additional effects done for the Director's Edition were absolutely fantastic. They didn't stand out like a sore thumb. In fact, they blended in so well, that on many occasions, I wasn't even sure if it was a new effect or not.  Mr. Wise tweaked and trimmed this movie to perfection.  Of course, this opportunity was long over due for him. I am so very thankful that Paramount gave him the chance to re-edit the movie the way HE wanted in the first place.  The 5.1 sound track is full and luxurious, and the addition of several sound effects throughout the movie really completes it well.<BR>The Director's Edition of ST-TMP truly changes and revitalizes this motion picture, and takes it to a whole new level. It is now a very satisfying movie, a whole universe apart from it's 1979 counterpart. It was easy to see why Mr. Wise was so unhappy with the original release, and all of  the personal anguish that he had to endure for the past two decades before he could finally 'right' the wrongs. <br />The bonus disc of the set is also very insightful, packed with three new documentaries, as well as all the added and trimmed scenes from the original '79 release, and the '83 TV premiere. I have not yet had the chance to view the movie with the addedcommentary, but I have no doubt that it will most likely be one of the most interesting commentaries that I have ever encountered.<br />My most sincere thanks to Mr. Wise and Paramount Pictures for giving all of us who love Star Trek the ultimate gift. I'll stop now so you can buy this movie and enjoy it for yourself!!
B00004XMTH|5.0|My children absolutely love the video CATS. They watched it over and over and have memorized the songs. It is a great family movie and introduces the children to the arts. I would recommend CATS to anyone. The music and dancing in CATS have the children out of their seats and dancing along.
B00005OM4N|5.0|The c.d has a nice beat as it kicks off with &quot; I'm a Slave 4 u&quot; the c.d has so many beats it makes you want to dance. &quot; I love Rock and Roll&quot; is a greta beat as Britney sings about loving a guy.&quot; What it's like being me&quot; her dou song with Justin Timberlake is a smooth song which is nicely beat which makes you feel good. This c.d. is a plan must have!
0345413377|5.0|Weired... interesting..but very powerful. I believe this is one of those books that made me not only think, but also regret that i dont have to think about anything anymore. The end was unexpected, maybe this is why it was so good. It wasnt  a typical end, and that is what gave this book a different note. To read three long books and to be dissapointed is not right, and these books are not for any taste; but if you happen to get interested in them, I garantee you an unique and amazing experience.
B0000029AP|5.0|This is it - ESSENTIAL AEROSMITH #2, right behind ROCKS. Anybody that believes Aerosmith has always been a second rate band needs to look at the artwork inside, and listen to the music on, this CD. WALK THIS WAY was way ahead of it's time. SWEET EMOTION is awesome. YOU SEE ME CRYING is one of the most beautiful rock songs I've ever heard. All of the tracks on this album are KILLER, and that's quite an accomplishment considering these guys put this album together in a barn just outside of Boston. As I said about ROCKS, you can't be an Aerosmith fan if you don't own this CD. Nothing more to say.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I Bought this CD on a friends recomendation.  I had seen the &quot;one armed scissor&quot; video and was impressed by the energy of the track but I wasn't really attracted to the sound of the band.  After one listen to the entire album I was realy glad I listened to my friend.  First off the Energy of this album is amazing.  After seeing where rock music is heading (limp biskit is our generations white snake) An honest &quot;main stream&quot; album was quite a surprise,  there is nothing self-absorbed about this band.  Listening to this on headphones is great experience,  The twirling guitars, layered percussion, harmonized vocals, and intense songwriting made repeated listenings a new experience everytime.  Anyone that can make a cd that you'd want to drive fast to AND be able to sit down and relax rates high in my book.  Unfortunatly I heard rumors that the band broke up because of managment difficulties. please tell me it isn't so...
B00005JKHP|2.0|First of all, I'm a Trekkie through and through. I don't subscribe to the &quot;Trekker&quot; nonsense.  I was a Trekkie in the 70's and in my view calling myself something else would not only be a specious gesture, but would dishonor everything Star Trek has taught me; in short, accepting what you are and embracing diversity.  To change how I see myself in order to fit into some strange Star Trek clique would be beneath me.<br />That said, I loved The Motion Picture.  It had flaws, of course, but the story was classic Star Trek.  I've watched and re-watched it on VHS, as many of us have, for decades.  When I saw interview after interview with Bob Wise and those responsible for this DVD, and reading the Star Trek magazine which featured it, I was totally jazzed about this release.  I went to 4 different stores until I found it, and once I did find it, I asked the clerk to go into the back of the store and get it for me, as they hadn't seen fit to display it on the release date.  Various reviews have lauded this DVD as an incredible piece of work.  A dramatic and compelling retelling of a classic story.  More dramatic, better music, and woohoo.  At the end of the DVD, I found myself wondering what the heck I missed!<br />Yes, there were some new effects shots. But when it comes down to it, all they really did was cut out a few good scenes and put them on Disc 2.  We're talking literally 5 or so scenes of several seconds apiece, ALL of which can be found on the old VHS version, and none of which were worth removing in the first place.  I haven't yet watched the documentaries, but I'm hoping they are worth the 20 bucks I spent on this disappointment.  I don't remember any &quot;new&quot; footage during the movie.  Not once during the film did I say to myself, &quot;Oh, this is great new material!&quot; There is nothing noticeably new here but eye candy.<br />One dramatic moment takes place during the &quot;rec room&quot; briefing shortly before the Enterprise leaves spacedock.  This is nothing more than an extended silent pause before Kirk dismisses the crew to their stations.  And you'll notice a few lines removed, but I saw nothing that stood out as new. They changed a few sound effects, like the alert sounds, which was pointless.  They did it not to improve the piece, but just to show they could do something different.  So the viewer would say, &quot;Oh!  This is different than what I'm used to!  New footage!&quot;  Nonsense.  This DVD, and the hype surrounding it, are nothing more than hoopla in my opinion.  When I re-watch this movie, and I will, I'll likely pop in my worn-out VHS tape rather than see this sliced-and-diced version of the film.<br />I give this item 2 stars only out of loyalty to the original film.  Most of the &quot;new&quot; things in this version are not worth the loss of the &quot;old&quot; stuff they took out.  Someone please tell me what I missed, other than twenty bucks that could have been given to charity.
1577311523|4.0|I must say that there are a lot of helpful insights in the book.The root of the conflict that humanity has at the moment is certainly 'the self' or 'the me' in other words. I have no doubt in my mind about it. So I would like to thank those who are seriously concerned about this matter because this is world's greatest problem that must be dealt with immediately. On the other hand when we go into this matter deeply we see that 'the self' is such a subtle and dangerous entity that wants to live forever. In this journey towards truth there are many who fell into some kinds of spritual illusions. They said they even experienced death. So we must be very alert and watchful in this journey. There are lots of people who want to be gurus. They may be both in a spritual illusion or they may do this for their own good. I am not saying this for Tolle but I am just merely stating a fact. I noticed two things which I must have questioned with Tolle. First is the name of the book. The name on the book offers you some kind of power. Since we all seek some kind of power this name would sound to people very attrective. So I question if the purpose of tolle is to gather some people around him or his purpose is merely find those who seek truth seriously. He could heve been more carefull when choosing this name. The subtle danger is that the root of the problem with humanity is this seeking of power of anykind since I think all power is evil. Second thing with tolle is his other book about practicing living in the now. I think there is no practice and method of meditation whatsoever. If anybody offers some method for meditation he wants to be a teacher then. In my opinion there must be no guru in this journey towards truth since I think 'truth is a patless land' as J.Krishnamurti says. We must be both the teacher and the disciples for ourselves. Only then we can be a light to ourselves. I hope I am wrong with my doubts with tolle since I think we certainly need some who want to tansform their conciousness seriously and innocently since we need this transformation of human conciousness immediately. Otherwise this sacred life will come to an end soon. Again thanks to Tolle and those who wants to something about this.
B00005R87Q|3.0|Do not watch this movie if you're looking for substance; it has none. This movie is like a throw-back to those classic Drive-in movies...all action, and all style.<br />That being said, I found the movie enjoyable...however I found the glorified import racing scene to be more of an advertisement than a &quot;plot point.&quot; Also, this movie seemed to convince every (economy) import-owner out there that their car was fast...or they could pull off what was done in the movie.<br />It was a 13 second Eclipse, a 12 second Supra, and a Charger with a wheelie bar in reality. Try to remember that.<br />Its recommendable...if you can discern fact from fiction.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney has definately shown her maturity in her third album \\"Britney\\". With tracks such as Boys, I'm A Slave 4 U, and Lonely, it is evident that she is headed for an older crowd and yet is keeping the teens content with songs such as Overprotected, Cinderella, and the beautiful ballad I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. This is by far the greatest achievement Britney has accomplished and I wish her all the best of luck (...). Congratulations to her and I hope each and every Amazon visitor picks up a copy of this awesome album! Check out Amzon.co.uk to find the European version of \\"Britney\\" including 2 BONUS TRACKS!
B00005OM4N|4.0|I know, I know.  No adult admits to liking Britney but I have to admit I do.  I bought this because I love the first single, and listened to it while working out at the gym last night.  It's good!  I like the songs &quot;Overprotected&quot; and &quot;Lonely&quot;.  All are pretty good dance songs.  It's not deep, heavy music, but then again I didn't expect that!  It's a good CD, and if you're looking for something fun to listen to, pick it up!
014028009X|5.0|Well, I saw the movie and just loved it.  Decided that I had to read the book and since they were right next to each other on the shelf, picked up the sequel too.  Boy did I get my moneys worth.  I spent the next 2 days balancing between laughter and amazement. <BR> <BR>First, I laughed because I was finally reading a book about a single woman my age who suffers from the same problems I do even though we live in different parts of the world.  Bridget is 33, single, isn't 98lbs. and still considers herself a &quot;Sex Goddess&quot;.  WOW, Me Too! <br />I laughed at her weight chronicles and commisserated with her by eating several pieces of chocolate when she too suffered an &quot;overnight mystery weight gain&quot;.  <br />I think I fell in love with Mark around the same time she did, but who couldn't love a guy like him.<br />My other reaction was amazement...I kept yelling at the book &quot;Stop Listening to Jude, Shaz and Tom, What do they know?  None of them are in a &quot;Normal Relationship&quot; either, so why are you listening to them?  In book 2 when Shaz unplugged the phone at Bridget's because she didn't want Bridge to call Mark for an explaination about their misunderstanding, I screamed &quot;What are you letting her do? Plug that phone in and call him!&quot;  And if Jude quoted 1 more romance self-help book I would have choked her. But then again that's just me.  <br />All in all, I loved both books and would love a sequel to the movie. <br />Great Reading for Over Thirty 'Singleton's'!
B00000251N|5.0|I remember when I first heard this album. I was using the computer, and my dad said &quot;This album is very beautiful, I think you'll like it.&quot; And boy did I!!<BR>I was 12 at that time. I'm 16 now and I'm still in love with that music. It is, as one of the songs says, timeless. In the moment I heard it, I knew what the album was about - the sea... I knew this before even reading the book.<BR>You see, I've always been a big fan of the sea and the seagulls. For me, they represent total freedom, total perfection. And this music encases the spirit of a seagull in a perfect way.<BR>If you like the sea, the seagulls, Neil Diamond's music or that wonderful, marvelous book, Jonathan Livingstone Seagull, this CD is a must for you. <BR>Buy it. I assure you you'll fell in love with it as fast as I did.
B00005QIPH|1.0|Yeah this is a 5 star album by a cover band. But since this is not VH1's &quot;Coverwars&quot; they get the real world: 1 star. Why? No real ground is broken, the songs are sung in a whiny spoiled brat way about what they experienced while &quot;slumming&quot; that weekend. Boring!!!   <BR>Do yourself a favor and pick up Television's &quot;Marquee Moon&quot; and you will see what a real band can do without distortion and you will also realize why The Strokes should be named The Hoax.
0385505833|5.0|After reading A Painted House, I knew Grisham was on a new level of writing.  Skipping Christmas is a perfect example of great writing.  Funny story and great characters.  I hope Grisham keeps it up in books to come.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album entitled &quot;Britney&quot; is simply some of the best work come up by her to date. Her past two albums were great career starters, but this new album has something that makes it stand apart from the other two, it has an edgier more futuristic flare.My favorite song is &quot;Overprotective&quot;, it just seems like something new that no one has come up with before. Britney, your the best, and you will always be to your true die-hard fans. We love you.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This cd is really really good.Britney sounds a lot more grown up and mature. Every song is really catchy and clear.The Highlights include I'm a Slave For You, Overprotected, I'm Not a Girl Not Yet A Woman,Boys, Anticipating, and That's Where You Take Me.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I was waiting for this album, but after listening it 3 times, this CD will probably move in the &quot;just ok column&quot;. The &quot;hooks&quot; are not very good, so one hour after listening, I can only remember the phrase &quot;I'm A Slave&quot;. But that is not enough. The song &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; became just a lame pop cover song. I hope, she has the support for an Album No.4. Because No. 3 is not a good number for her...
6301599411|4.0|This movie is fascinating and inspiring, and not because any of it is true.  The gorgeous photography and haunting musical score brought countless archaeological wonders to life and may have indirectly allowed them to survive by bringing their existence and peril to the attention of the world community.  Von Daniken's theories constitute a sort of &quot;fake history&quot;, not altogether different from the various conspiracy theories purporting to explain our complicated modern world, but his fake history was the catalyst that allowed American audiences to cultivate an interest in the treasures of vanished peoples.<br />For me, this film constitutes a record of childhood wonder that was soon outgrown in the face of actual education and experience.  Seeing the movie again has brought renewed respect for the ingenuity and artistic flair of the ancients.  No &quot;extraterrestrials&quot; are needed to explain the richness of our cultural past.
B00004RD54|3.0|The review is spot-on for this album.  Almost Allman Brother's 'ish in its use of 2 dualling lead guitars, transforming the classic songs totally.  It's a real oddity in the Reed cannon and easy to see why he rejects it now.  The sound is good but Reed is nowhere to be heard for large parts of it - you can almost picture him wandering up to the mike to throw a verse in at the appropriate time.<br />As a guitar based live album it stands up well - the twin guitar intro to Sweet Jane is gorgeous, and the way it suddenly drops into the riff when Reed makes his arrival is one of the great moments on any album. That said, if you are familiar with the Velvet's original work you almost won't recognise these songs at all.  The original amoral ambivalence of Heroin for example is lost in a huge new arrangement with Reed bellowing to be heard over the din.<br />Love the Velvet Underground's raw originals - then approach with care!  Love skillful, slick, live guitar workouts (with some bloke hollering the words in the background) then this may be for you!
0345451325|5.0|okay - the story is great, the characters are believable and all that good stuff.<BR>BUT - reading this book makes me feel like it was rushed to market. This does nothing to stop it from being a great read, but it's annoying to pick out a spelling or grammar error in the middle of an immersive battle scene.<BR>Personaly, I think the book needs a proof-read and re-release...but I doubt that's going to happen.<BR>Regardless, I recommend reading this.
B00003CXXI|4.0|So before I go out and rent Shrek, I am told that it is the best movie of the year. I get my hopes up, believing that Shrek will entertain me and all that, but I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It was a hilarious movie with a cute story line, but I don't think I can consider it the best movie of the year. Yes, the donkey, or I should say Eddie Murphy, does do a great job with the little humorous dialogue here and there but it just needed a little bit more from every character. <BR> The day before I rented Shrek, I saw the movie Monsters Inc.. I definetly compared the two and I thought Monsters a more all around cute, hilarious, and great story line movie. This is probably my source of comparison and is probably where my synicism arised from. I guess the two movies are very much different but I definetly believe Shrek really uncomparable to Monsters Inc.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I haven't seen the movie in years yet remember it so clearly.  The acting, photography and music were all phenomenal! The story is captivating and of course De Niro steals the show.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Omigosh, what happened??!!  is what I wanted to say when I saw the cover of Britney Spears' new album and heard \\"(I'm a) Slave 4 U.\\"  She used to be sweet and innocent looking and now....well...she went from PG-13 to almost R.<BR>I really did like the old Britney, maybe because I'm more of a \\"soda-pop\\" person than \\"dirty-pop.\\"  Is it true Justin of *NSync helped her with this album?  He succeeded in making Britney more of a(...)than before!<BR>I know some people will like this new style, and maybe some will agree with me.  The beat and melody for \\"Slave 4 U\\" is nice and catchy, but the lyrics....how cheesy!<BR>What will be next, Miss Britney \\"X-rated\\" Spears?  How is this artist supposed to be appropriate for kids?<BR>As you can see, the cover of \\"Britney\\" gives a sneak preview of the inside.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan of Britney Spears (maybe?  kinda?  sorta?) and I wish her luck with her future, but I guess I'll have to look and listen to Mandy Moore for pop the way I like it now.
0385505833|5.0|I purchased this book the day that it was released - and finished it the same day.  It's an unusual book for Grisham, much as his last novel, A Painted House.  This light-hearted tale of a couple who decide to skip Christmas for a year makes for a great read.  Their misadventures will keep you riveted to the book.
0375701427|5.0|This is Roth's finest book that I have read.  I have always liked the author's unabashed use of sex and the Id in his book, but at times it is so absurd it's distracting.  However, in American Pastoral, the sex in the book is in balance with the scenarios in the book.  Mary Levov, daughter of the high school hero Swede Levov, is a stuttering, fanatical, and highly impressionable child that drives her father from the perfect idyllic life to one of despair and loneliness.  Swede's daughter gets herself involved with a passionate anti-Vietnam group and she ends up planting a bomb in a local post office killing the town doctor.  Mary is on the run and Swede along with the rest of the family shoulder the guilt and the pain of their daughter's folly.<br />This situation exacerbates the differences in Swede's marriage, his relationship with his parents, his job, and his overall place in the world.  Everything that was once perfect is in ruins.  Everything is short-lived, except sadness and despair.  Mary, a bright but insecure child jumps from extremisms, and becomes a Jain instead of a violent protestor.<br />Everyone knows of Philip Roth's incredible abilities, but it was nice to read a serious book of his without the overpowering Freudian Id in the mix.  This is one of the most entertaining and best books I have read.
B00005OM4N|4.0|With &quot;Britney&quot;, Britney Spears gives us what exactly what we've come to expect from her: dance driven beats with catchy lyrics.  The songs on this album are, however, a bit edgier than those on her other cds.  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot; are some of the best songs in the lineup.  The problem with the album is it's slower ballad-type songs.  They're sappy and suffer from poorly written lyrics.   Britney continues her trend of covering older songs by recording the Joan Jett classic &quot;I Love Rock 'N' Roll&quot;, which she does a pretty good job with. Overall, Britney delivers a good album, on par with her past work.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I am a Britney fan, but this is honestly the first of her 3 CD's that I buy.  I really, really like this CD.  Her voice sounds better than her previous work, and the songs are more grown up.  I love tracks #1,2,4,8,9.  The others are also good, but those are my faves.  Anyone who likes her, will also love this CD!
B00005QDW5|4.0|What I like about Echoes, is it being the 1st true compilation-album, offering a solid survey of 35 years of the Floyd. The quality of the sound is superb! What I do not like about it, is the fact that nothing was used from the albums More, Obscured by clouds, Ummagumma and Atom Heart Mother, the first two albums being sountracks to B-movies. Perhaps this failure can be restored in another compilation-CD, mext year or so.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I bought this CD yesterday and truly enjoy it.  I am a Britney fan but this is actually the first of her CD's I buy.  The songs are all upbeat except for 1, and her voice sounds great!  If you like her previous work, you will really enjoy this CD!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I love this CD as much as I love 'Oops...I did it again' and '...Baby, one more time'. This whole CD is very upbeat and very danceable with the exception of the sole ballad, 'I'm not a girl, not yet a woman' which, in my opinion, is the best song on the CD. She also does a wonderful sexed-up version of 'I love rock n roll'. Plus Justin Timberlake (her ex-beau) wrote and produced and did back-up vocals for 'What it's like to be me' one of the best dance tracks on the CD. All the others are great also....
B00005OM4N|5.0|Wow!  This is awesome!  Britney's voice has really matured!  If you are into pop/rock, this is the one to get!  Unbelieveable!!  I would not recommend it for little kids though!
B000002JSR|4.0|I remember clearly when this album came out and people were so down on it since it was culled from out-takes.  Reviewers slamed it, radio DJs refused to play cuts.  But I bought it and liked much of it.  &quot;Darlene&quot; is an excellent blues rocker, the kind of tune Robert could sing convincingly.  The variety is refreshing, from the funk of &quot;Poor Tom&quot; to the kick of &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; and &quot;Ozone Baby&quot;.  &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot; was recorded at a sound check and gives you an indication of what the band's live sound could be like on a good day - dynamic and hard-edged.  If you like Led Zeppelin in general, you'll find something to like here, especially if you liked In Through The Out Door, since three of the songs were from those sessions.  &quot;Wearing and Tearing&quot; is one of those three and I consider it a classic.
0684803356|4.0|&quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; is no disappointment to a fan of Hemingway's terse, truthful prose.  Here he employs it to explain the events of a few days during the Spanish Civil War.  The plot is simple: an American fighting for the republic joins a small guerrilla unit in the hills, under orders to blow up a bridge at the beginning of a great assault on the fascists.  The American also falls in love with a young Spanish girl, thus allowing Hemingway to explore his favorite combination of themes, love and war.<br />Hemingway is, in my view, one of the most moving and profound writers of all time.  In this novel, he aptly captures the emotions and motives of those who risk their lives at war, and along the way, offers some extraordinarily memorable stories of both bravery and brutality.<br />To me, the novel's main weakness is the love story.  The protagonist's love interest, as in all of Hemingway's novels, is young (19 years old, in this case), beautiful, naive, and ignorant.  She worships Robert Jordan, and obeys his every command much as a puppy.  Having no mind of her own, she is wholly contented by serving Jordan in ways such as washing his socks and and drying out his sleeping bag.<br />The only other oddity in the novel is Hemingway's habit of translating Spanish literally.  For example, he uses thou and you to differentiate between the Spanish speaker's use of &quot;tu&quot; and &quot;Usted.&quot;  He also uses such nonsensical phrases as &quot;I have much hunger&quot; as a translation for the Spanish &quot;tengo mucho hambre,&quot; and &quot;What passes with thee?&quot; for &quot;Qué te pasa?&quot;.  I found that a bit distracting.<br />On the whole, however, I found the novel remarkable.  Hemingway's ability to pare down complex ideas and events into such simple, powerful prose is unsurpassed.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I was very pleased when I had heard that John Williams was brought in to compose the music for the Harry Potter film.  This score may be his best.  A definite &quot;magical&quot; waltz running through the entire CD.  I can also hear remnants of his other scores running through this music as well (Hook, The Witches of Eastwick, and Jurassic Park.)  My favorite track on this CD is the final one:  Hedwig's Theme.  That piece pretty much sums up the entire CD.  This is great music to listen to when reading your favorite Harry Potter book (I'm almost done with Book 4!!)  Can't wait for the movie!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I never laughed so hard as when I was wathcing Shrek.  This movie has enough great one-liners to make any one who likes to drop movie lines happy.<br />Eddie Murphy is great as &quot;Donkey&quot;.  I especially liked the part where Shrek tells Princess Fionna that the only trick about his talking donkey is getting him to shut up.<br />Mike Myers nailed it as Shrek, simply great.
B000002JSH|5.0|Released in 1974, Straightshooter is regarded by many as being Bad Company's strongest album. It has the bluesy feel of its predecessor (Bad Co) but has the band turning their amps up 11 and rocking out the strongest set of songs of the band's career. Do not forget that Bad Co was a supergroup with 2 guys out of Free (Rodgers and Kirke), the bass player from King Crimson (Boz Burrell) and Mott the Hoople's guitarist (Mick Ralphs). They should have been huge, of course, but suffered from having to play second fiddle to Swan Song stablemates Led Zeppelin. The songs were great, their sound: a sort of supercharged, sexy blues-rock without the pretention of Led Zep. What let them down perhaps was their lyrics, some of which make Spinal Tap look like Leonard Cohen, but if you can take that - and I can - this album is a great listen from beginning to end. Bad Company were also one of the few hard rock bands that wrote great ballads (Anna), though it was Straightshooter's high-octane rockers like Good Lovin' Gone Bad, Feel Like Making Love and Shooting Star that helped secure them a place in rock history. Bad Company were a good, tight band, but I would recommend anyone to listen to them purely to hear Paul Rodgers' masterful rock vocals. New to Bad Company? Get this one first, and then Bad Co.
B000021YQV|5.0|I believe that these guys reall need to shut up.  they are so addicting and it is one great cd.  BUY IT.  The songs are great from  begining to the end, and you will eventually love this cd.  (...)  BUY IT.  I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS!  **********
B00005JKHP|4.0|Based on the new release by Paramount (the first Star Trek DVD/Video with any semblance of extra features that have meat on them), a perceived wrong has now been corrected. No longer is it Star Trek: The Motionless Picture, although there is still a little bit of &quot;Where Nomad Has Gone Before&quot; in it. Wise often said that he had made 30 films, and 29 of them were representative of his standard of quality. Now it's 30.<br />In many cases, a matter of a few frames to a few minutes in some areas was trimmed from the film. No longer are there superfluous sections, such as those added in 1983 to make the film a &quot;TV Event.&quot; The story moves better. The action plays better. And the flaws in the main characters are more pronounced and poignant. Remember that this script was the basis for an episode for the second Star Trek series that never happened (thank you Michael Eisenberg), not a feature film story, and it was ultimately rushed out to compete with Star Wars, Close Encounters, Battlestar Galactica, and any number of science fiction (not based in fact) films. So it was not the directors fault. Blame deadlines in stone and Jeffrey Katzenberg if you want, but leave Bob Wise alone.<br />Even the most subtle of changes have created a new patina of texture in line with the palette of tricks used when it was first made. The special effects guys were able to retrograde their work to 1978/1979 standards to the point that if you were seeing it the first time it would hard to determine what was added and where. Still, shots that used to be static now have motion. Shots in which we were previously looking at reactions or the view screen now actually have something to react to. The story, even though it is essentially the same, is also tighter. Also, the recomposed final approach and crew exit from the Enterprise to contact V'ger alone raises the level of this film several notches.<br />One more note for you critics. It is not outstanding. The even numbered ST films still retain that accolade. But it is new enough that it has a new copyright date, and altered enough that it now warrants a PG rating instead of the original G. Also, the few moments we see of William Shatner talking about the work actually seem to present him without the expected veneer seen in the past (but still with a piece on - and so what!). He appears more genuine than memory provides. So let him be also. Read his books. He was willing to let go of the com long before many Star Trek fans were wanting to let him do so.<br />I am a fan of intellectual writing and good storyline, which made ST:TNG my favorite series for some time (along with NYPD Blue and West Wing to show you my tastes). While I am well versed in Trek-lore (or Data and Lor) I don't go to conventions, wear uniforms or prosthetics, or even split my fingers when I greet people. Still, from the intellectual point of view -<BR>THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT PEOPLE. IT HAS A MESSAGE IN THERE, BUT IT IS ENTERTAINMENT.<BR>This isn't a documentary or Private Ryan or something. So for the entertainment value I rate it at 4+ stars, saving films like Wrath of Kahn and Dr. Zhivago for 5 stars. Got a problem with that? I got a Klingon friend to introduce you too!<br />Thanks for reading. Live long and buy the DVD.
B000007MVU|4.0|Before Carly Simon sang her torch songs...before Linda Ronstadt worked with<BR>Nelson Riddle...before Natalie Cole did duets with her father...before Bono<BR>crooned with Frank Sinatra... and before Joni Mitchell released her forties<BR>tribute CD last year, with the London Symphony, in smokey, 'Lady Day' vocal<BR>style...there was Ringo Starr - recording the songs he heard his family sing<BR>growing up in Liverpool.<BR>Indeed, Ringo's first solo album - Sentimental Journey - was a tribute to his<BR>parents and the music they loved, containing a dozen songs from the 20's<BR>through the 50's - written by the likes of Cole Porter, Hoagy Carmichael, and<BR>Johnny Mercer, and recorded by such artists as Tommy Dorsey, The Ink Spots, Les<BR>Paul, and Doris Day (title song). The album, comprising up-tempo tunes and<BR>ballads such as Night and Day, Bye Bye Blackbird, Stardust, and the title song<BR>Sentimental Journey,  boasts some fine big band and orchestral arrangements by<BR>none other than Quincy Jones, George Martin, and<BR>even Paul McCartney and Maurice Gibb. And Ringo's voice is in fine nasal form<BR>throughout. All in all, Sentimental Journey - the first of its kind for a Rock<BR>Artist (I believe) - is an interesting and fun gem, and one of Ringo's best<BR>albums to date.
B00004YKUY|4.0|I was very skeptical about this cd, but with one listen, I found out that Journey can survive without Steve Perry. Although I miss Perry's crooning, the new lead singer is fantastic and a good replacement (if there has to be one).  The first three songs on this cd are my favorite because they are true to the Journey sound, but still have a cutting edge sound that keeps them from being &quot;dated.&quot;  Give this cd a chance, I'm glad that I did!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd never ceases to amaze, they have taken many of us through those long college nights that only seemed appropriate for them. Now we have what could be considered the definitive collection for over 155 minutes of classic music. They have shown us how with a little fun with the placement of tracks that everything flows together like it was meant to be there in the first place.  This is definitely a CD that will not be coming out of the stereo anytime soon.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I'll admit I was a little hesitant about this so-called &quot;Best of&quot; compilation...given the fact that nearly all of Pink Floyd's albums rely on the interweaving of songs to create an album long song-piece.  To take these songs out of context (and out of time) for a compilation seems like an exceedingly bad idea, one created in the back rooms of a record studio looking to further cash-in on one of the best selling bands in history. <br />However, this album does come together on several different levels, and is about as perfect as a two-disc anthology of Pink Floyd could possibly be.  It isn't really a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; since numerous radio standards have been left off, including Breathe, Brain Damage/Eclipse, Welcome to the Machine, Have a Cigar, Mother, Young Lust, Run Like Hell, and On the Turning Away. And it isn't necessarily a &quot;Best of&quot; either, with the inclusion of the instrumental Marooned and The Fletcher Memorial Home and the seldom heard When the Tigers Broke Free instead of numerous other choices.<br />A more appropriate album title would have been The Pink Floyd Story, because what Echoes really attempts to do is document the various and distinct periods of the band, from early Syd Barret material, through the band's 1970s creative peaks, and then when the band was essentially a solo vehicle for Waters and then Gilmour.  But the underlying theme through all the music is Barrett, and the inclusion of five tracks off of Piper at the Gates of Dawn and Saucerful of Secrets is much more than giving his tunes equal time as a tribute, it shows how much his legacy affected and was ultimately responsible for the greatness Pink Floyd achieved.  And so it is extremely appropriate that as Disc 2 winds down, we are returned to one of Pink Floyd's ealiest tunes, Arnold Lane. Wish You Were Here follows as the band's tribute to Syd, but then Jugband Blues appears with Syd singing the bittersweet lines &quot;It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here.&quot;  Pink Floyd would have never existed if it wasn't for Syd, and he serves as the inspiration for most of the band's great works, so it is quite appropriate that he is represented so strongly on this set.<br />So in short, if you're looking for a comfortable, greatest hits package, this isn't it. But if you really want to know what Pink Floyd was all about, this is the place to start.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This is, by far, the best album Britney Spears has put out.  There's only one ballad, and her voice is just strong enough to fill out the fast songs.  The best song on here is called &quot;Boys&quot; where Britney says, &quot;Why don't you just sleep with me?&quot;  She collaborates with her hot boyfriend, and co-wrote 5 of the songs.  Of course, she probably wrote about 2 words in each of those because they're all written with at least two or three other people.  There are only three songs on here that I don't really care for.  &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; are, as one might guess, very cheesy, and &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; is just bland.  The best cuts are the sexy &quot;Boys,&quot; the angry &quot;Lonely,&quot; the beautiful &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,&quot; and the cover of &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll.&quot;
B00005LB9O|5.0|I first listened to this album with much reserve.  These guys sounded pretty jolly in &quot;Good Feeling,&quot; mellowed out in &quot;The Man Who,&quot; and what could be next?  The comparison to Radiohead was inevitable and I feared that Travis would go that route and nullified all their previous works as they would be nothing more than a bunch of imitators.<br />When I pressed eject after the first listening, I was neither impressed nor disappointed.  It was much like &quot;The Man Who,&quot; throw in a couple more rays of sunshine and a few flowers and voila, you have a record called the &quot;Invisible Band.&quot;  And &quot;The Man Who&quot; was a record that I had not been able to stop listening to for months.<br />The same pattern emerged after a few more listenings.  I simply could not stop listening to this album.  If my definition of good music is one that has to keep evolving and be experimented upon, this will receive minus stars.  &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; clearly picked up where &quot;The Man Who&quot; had left off.  However, I define good music as the music that I would listen to without getting tired of it two months after the purchase.  This record passed my litmus test with flying colors.<br />The songs remain simple and catchy, probably not as melancholic as &quot;The Man Who.&quot;   The lyrics are not exactly poetry, but not your mass-paperback writing either.  They are simple, yet they pack a good punch.  <br />The extra two tracks are a delight.  I bought my copy in Europe and it didn't come with the two extra tracks, but &quot;Ring Out the Bell&quot; is probably worth the price of the whole CD.  <br />The Beatles they are not, but they'll do right now.<br />&quot;So ring out the bell, I'll fly where the sun wants to tell, my shoulders are colder since I fell.&quot;
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album has all the beats and it just keeps on going. From a serious song that pulls at the heart to a fast and upbeat song that gets you dancing. It has no mistakes in it. It's fun and it is just what we all expected and have come to love about Britney. What a great album... well worth the money. I promise.
B00003CXTG|5.0|As a generation X'er I must say that war movies of our time top the &quot;John Wayne&quot; sterotypical era.  This movie doesn't insult or cut down the Japanese.  It depicts that moment in history objectively with romance, politics, and awesome action sequences.<br />With this movie a five star rating comes with two words &quot;Jerry Bruckheimer&quot;
B00005OM4N|5.0|I have been waiting for Britney's self-titled album and man did she not let me down. I bought the CD about 30 minutes after it was released and listened to it all the way through. The songs all have a beat that makes me get my groove on and want to blast my stereo in my car... but the fact that a lot of the songs are co-written by her really makes the album more meaningful. &quot;I'm not a Girl.. Not Quite a Woman&quot; is such a powerful song and says a lot to me.. a young woman caught in the same stage of life being at the same age as she. I really admire Britney for her courage to be different and to be so open in her lyrics about herself. I am flying to see her in Las Vegas for her live taping for HBO... I know she won't let me down there either. Britney--keep on keeping on girl. You've got so much going for you--and the new album is just an addition to the list of Britney 5 Stars. Definetely worth the money and the wait... and for the guys--the CD is enhanced and comes with a pull-out. Perks for everyone!
B00005O5CM|5.0|What a great movie, lots of big stars, what can I say about it? This is the ultimate Cute movie, I just loved it!
0385505833|4.0|I have a friend named Jimmy who acted just like the main character in this book.  I think anyone who reads this will be able to relate to the subtle intertwined storyline.  Captivating pictures allow you to sit and stare for hours.  I enjoyed reading this book whilest eating a taco (except I spilled some salsa on page 69.)<br />Please read this book.  John Grisham doesn't have enough money to remodel his yacht!  Times are tough and you'll learn all about them in SKIPPING CHRISTMAS!<br />- Hi Acid!
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Memento was, as director Christopher Nolan describes, although chronologically reversed, a very linear movie.  It is gripping from Act 1, Scene 1 and grants the viewer a slightly different experience the second time around.  The only reason that one might give this movie four out of five stars is the fact that it lacks real closure.  However, to Nolan's credit, the intention was not purely for the viewer's feeling of closure, but rather for some key cinematic effects; for example, the rather artistic display of reverse chronology, the sense of indeterminate time, and the superb acting.
6300214559|4.0|This is such a wonderful movie. Not too many people have heard about &quot;Lady Jane&quot; as it only spent a brief time in the theaters. <br />Helena Bonham Carter and the very young and beautiful Cary Elwes are wonderful together. Unfortunately, if you know the actual story of Lady Jane Grey, it doesn't quite match up to the movie version, but the love story between Lady Jane and Guilford is touching and wonderful.
0553108034|5.0|I loved this this book.  It was even better than the first which I thought was impossible.
B00005QDW5|5.0|While I really like Pink Floyd, I've often thought of myself as a casual fan. I own the stuff from Muddle to the Wall but nothing else (save Atom Heart Mother). I've always been interested in seeing what the band did during their earlier period but I was hesitant to go buy 5 or so albums worth of material I might not like, particularly since I wasn't too find of AHM. Same goes for the later material I was told to avoid.<br />This collection took care of that for me. I think it's a reasonable overview of their work. While it's obviously heavy on material from Dark Side and the Wall, other albums are well represented. I'm very pleased to see the abundance of Syd Barrett material here. I must admit, though, that I'm not sold on all the selections. I wish they had included The Turning Away from Momentary Lapse of Reason, but that's just me.<br />There's little here for the hard core fan except when The Tigers Broke Free. I imagine most of them have it on a bootleg or something already so there might really be nothing here for them at all. <br />One more thing. I was a bit skeptical when I heard the band was going to blend the songs together to make the songs &quot;one big experience&quot; or something. It's really not that bad. I was afraid that song intros were going to be cropped or redone and that's not really the case. It's not as intrusive as it might sound.<br />I would highly recommend this album for those wanting to get into Floyd or for those of us who are &quot;casual fans.&quot;
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is with no doubt the greatest album of all time. Besides the fact that Pink Floyd is the greatest and most influential rock group ever, having all their hits remastered and placed on a double-CD is a gift to all lovers of true music. Although I own all the albums Pink Floyd released, I still had to buy this one because this is truly their greatest hits album. In the 70s, the band released a greatest hit album titled &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot;, but this double-album captures the true greatest hits that were to come afterwards. Properly titled Echoes, Pink Floyd's Masterpiece, and the song that started it all, this album is a great addition to any Pink Floyd fan's collection. If you are not in love with this band, this album is the right album for a true music lover to get introduced to this influential band. Buy this album and start the quest with the Pink Floyd. Shine On!
B00005QDW5|4.0|&quot;Echoes&quot; serves as a terrific retrospective of Pink Floyd's largely illustrious recording career and will serve the newer or casual listener of Pink Floyd well.  However, serious listeners will want to delve into the individual albums (which, if you are a Pink Floyd fan, you probably already own) to get the full Floyd experience.  Of interest to long-time fans is the inclusion of &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free,&quot; from &quot;The Wall&quot; film, not previously released on compact disc.  Also, long time fans of Storm Thorgerson's Pink Floyd cover art will really appreciate the homage he's given to his own artwork of the past.  Hipgnosis lives! <br />This is not the first &quot;greatest hits&quot; package from the band (see &quot;Relics,&quot; &quot;Works,&quot; and &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot;) but it does cover the span from 1967's &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; up through 1994's &quot;The Division Bell,&quot; the band's last studio album to date (two live recordings, &quot;Pulse&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; were subsequently released).  Many, but not all of the band's greatest compositions are here on this two disc compilation, but there are plenty of omissions.  Some of the more obvious are &quot;Careful With That Axe Eugene,&quot; &quot;Run Like Hell,&quot; &quot;Dogs,&quot; (arguably, one of the greatest Gilmour/Waters compositions), &quot;Welcome to the Machine,&quot; and even &quot;One Slip&quot; and &quot;Take It Back&quot; from among the last two studio albums made without the participation of Roger Waters.  Still, it's a great compilation that only loses a star because the above weren't included.  This is timeless music from one of the greatest rock bands of all time.

0156012197|5.0|This little book is certainly one of the best-known and most popular in French literature.  Though at heart a children's story, it is rightly considered a classic in its own sense and is even found within respected French literary anthologies.  Its author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, is also famous for other works of fiction (&quot;Vol de Nuit&quot; etc.).  Like the narrator in &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; St-Exupery was a pilot as well.  He apparently crashed or was shot down flying as a WWII pilot towards the end of the war and was never found.  His likeness, along with that of the little prince and his pet lamb and the famous drawing of the elephant in the boa-constrictor, are all on the French 50 Franc note.<BR>The story can basically be split into two parts: The first part is the short introduction dealing with the narrator and his view of the world when he was a child and how adults could never understand the real meaning of things or perceive truth in the world--only the superficial and the usual.  This is generally one of the main ideas of the book; &quot;blessed are the children...&quot;.  The rest of the book is the story of the little prince, whom the narrator discovers in the Sahara when he is trying to fix his downed airplane and is in fear of his life.  The narrator and the reader slowly come to know the prince's story and learn about friendship, love and truth in a touching way.  My favorite parts are those dealing with the prince's relationship with his beloved rose left on his planet and the prince's relationship with the wise little fox, who offers the prince his philosophical secret on life.<BR>I have not read the book in translation so I cannot comment how this or other translations compare.  Though considered a book for children, the French can still be a bit demanding if you want to try it in the original.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I,ve been looking forward to this for quite some time, and it comes as quite a disappointment in terms of the look of the film itself. The space sequences are very dark and lack contrast and detail. The interior scenes at the beginning are way too warm and yellow. There are a lot of scratches on this transfer. The overall look of the picture is dull and blurry. This is all made very obvious to any viewer when you compare the movie's appearance to the dvd menu screens. The menus are rich and vibrant in colour and detail, where as the film itself is dark, flat and murky. Maybe the film's '70's cinematography is dated though, but other Robert Wise dvd's such as the &quot;Sound of Music&quot; look incredible! Not all the film is terrible but the tranfer is very uneven. 60% of the tranfer looks fine.
B000003JAY|4.0|Those that are looking only for the songs they heard on the radio are better off looking at one of the greatest hit compilations, but for those of us who enjoy the sheer heart-pumpin' attitude of Billy's best and want more of it will certainly want this one.  Some songs - such as Flesh for Fantasy - are drastically remixed and contain even more attitude (if that's possible), while others - like White Wedding, Part 2 - simply give you more of a good thing.<br />If you enjoy extended mixes, the unbridaled punk attitude of Billy Idol in the 80s, and a leg-thumping good time that'll make you wanna get up off yer rump and dance then this is the one to buy!
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|FINALLY!  A chick-flick and action-movie mix that my husband and I can both enjoy!  There was just enough of each to keep us both interested. We loved this movie!  It gave an entertaining and partially historical look at what things may have been like for the people during the bombing at Pearl Harbor.  It also included a great love triangle.  I highly recommend this movie!
B00005OM4N|5.0|This album is truely awesome!  It has Britney singing different styles such as R&amp;B as well as pop.  Some of it's best songs, I think, are Overprotected, Lonely, Cinderella, Bombastic Love, and What It's Like To Be Me.  Buy it!  It's well worth it!
0875845851|5.0|Prof. Christensen introduces the ideas of 'value network' and 'distruptive innovations'. Successful companies follow their customers up-market, eventually overshooting the needs of the bulk of their customers. When a distruptive innovation occurs, the value network of the leading company -- its profit margins, quality expectations, etc. -- do not permit it to embrace a solution which is inferior to its current offering. The disruptive innovation eventually blossoms into a better solution than what the established company offers. Microsoft has been very successful from its founding in 1975, but as the Internet rose to prominence in the mid-1990s and Windows and Office are aging not very gracefully at the start of the 21st century, Microsoft is absolutely caught in the innovator's dilemma that Christensen describes.
0553378384|5.0|I am very happy to be able to review this excellent book. I discovered it by intuition and have not regeretted buying it! I feel as if a piece of heaven has fallen to earth in the form of this book, it really is such a treasure. Jan says the North node makes the rest of your natal chart come alive, and it's so true. It's like reading about yourself; so many of her little gems of insight are things I have felt before about myself but hadn't yet properly crystallised. A wonderful guide to how to get the best from yourself and your life, I am very thankful to Jan Spiller for having written this inspiring, uplifting work. I wonder how to contact her....?
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A serial story told in reverse, by scene.  Truly mind numbing.
B000002KB8|5.0|When I first listened to Black Sabbath, I induldged into the heavy, screaming rifts of Iommoi's guitar and Ozzy's magnificent voice (although in Black Sabbath his voice is different from his other work in Sabbath). The Wizard was one of the most greatist songs I've ever heard! With the bluese sounds of the harmonica to the constant bass of Geezer. N.I.B., which I think, started the whole bass solo's and its genius in two guitar solo's as well. Wicked World, with its frightning true lyrics, has one of the most awesome rifts ever! However, my most favorite song is The Warning, with the guitar solo sounding like two people playing at once. But, it was the solo near the end that got me. With the screaming sound in the beginning to the Heavy Metal one at the end; this is certainly a great work!<br />In case you are wondering... Sabbath got the idea for this album from Boris Karloff's film. Black Sabbath. One would see the resemblance if they say the film.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Cool, yeah, amazing. Britney is the best. She is so cool. This album is the best album ever and I want everyone to own it forever. Sometimes I wish I could be Britney because she's so cool and skinny. We love Brit. I'm a slave for you. WOOOOOO!!!!!
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Shrek is a film that will make you laugh and the visuals are amazing. Unfortunately, this film is not suitable for children under 13. There is adult humor and inapropriate language used throughout the film. I recommend this for the adults out there, but do not buy it for your kids. If you do, then you are a lowsy parent.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I write this having only seen The Godfather disk and the bonus material disk. <br />And what a pleasure it was!<br />My experience of this DVD brought back many of the feelings I recall from the theater viewings of 20 plus years ago, when I'd see both I and II in an afternoon. There are a lot of erudite musings in these reviews about the significance of The Godfather in the history of the late 20th Century. I was struck by how operatic the damn thing is, melodramatic, grand, sweeping. The tragic journey one takes in sitting through the movie is exhausting and strangly satisfying in a morbid way.<br />I'm the first to complain about technical issues, and I have nothing but praise. You see now, finally, the entire image side to side as was intended by the film makers. The sound track is rich and revealing as so many digital renditions are nowadays.<br />I don't understand complaints about picture quality and dark photography. You should have seen the abomination that was the laser disk! If anything, this video is pumped up slightly and more revealing in shadow detail that Gordon Willis originally gave us in the theatrical release prints. The image is clean and timed and telecined with love and care.<br />The bonus material is fun and very revealing of the maestro's delightful and passionate nature. I had the pleasure of working with him on two pictures. He's a man who cares deeply and sincerely about his artistry. That spirit is evident in these disks.
0062502182|5.0|Paulo Coelho is an excellent writer. In the shape of a fable, he teaches his readers things everyone should know - how to listen to your heart and what is the way to be happy and fulfilled. The things he says are so basic that, if he told you them directly, you would not believe him. But the truth is that you already knew it, and he is simply reminding you - poignantly, simply, beautifully, that you should follow your dreams. Highly recommended.
0714834491|5.0|No adjectives suffice to capture Alan Fletcher's amazing book. It is a breathtaking experience for eye, mind, and heart. It is the quintessential ode to human creativity and the  imagination. In his forward, Fletcher mentions how most books make you &quot;analyse rather than experience&quot;, how they are concerned &quot;with the match rather than the fire&quot;. The spirit of this book in a nutshell! What a labour of love! This is a book I would take with me on that proverbial deserted island!
0694003611|5.0|I got this as a gift when my son was born, and will always treasure it.  It is a perfect book for young children.  My son is ten months, and he loves looking at all the colors, and pictures.  and sometimes appreciates my reading the cute story about the bunny getting ready to go to bed.<br />I have the board book of Goodnight Moon and it is the perfect size for him to look at without much help from me.<br />It's a classic story that has been around for years, and it has never lost it's audience.
B00005QDW5|2.0|Who decides what songs to put on these greatest hits compliations? They need to have someone not associated with the band pick the songs. They left so many songs off that should have been here that they're too numerous to mention. Some that are here I don't want to hear again. I'm putting my copy up for sale on ebay tonight.
0307120007|5.0|While &quot;Pat the Bunny&quot; may be a true classic children's book, it is also a great curiousity piece for infants big enough to know what they are looking at somewhat.<br />My son is ten months old and loves to literally tear this book apart as the binding is sort of flimsy.  He loves to touch everything and play with all the &quot;interactive&quot; things throughout the book.  He just gets more curious with each page, and wants to figure out how it all works.<br />This is great for babies and preschoolers that love to touch everything they see.
B00003XB8K|4.0|Even though Michael Cretu always uses samples, and don't chant for himself, like he did on one of the first songs on 'Enigma 3', this is Enigma's masterpiece, that is filled with folk music of all kind, classical choir music, modern day electronic music, and lyrics about sex and unexplained mysteries of our earth, and the outer space.
6304712936|5.0|As many music enthusiasts know, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was one of the most talented composers of all time, truly was, and is believed to of been influenced purely by god. This movie describes Mozart's life from his worst enemy's point of view after his death when Soliert is emitted to an insane asylum. From childhood to the end of Wolfgang's life he tickled the keys of the piano always with his father's approval, unlike Soliert, he had to wait for his father to die.<BR> Through their differences in like they still seem to cross paths after Wolfgang humiliates himself and then dose a remix to Soliert's welcome song. They do grow a kind of bond, a strange bond. Mozart thinks of Soliert as a best friend, while Soliert hates Mozart but is probably his #1 fan. And through Mozart's childish behavior Soliert plots to kill him witch leads to a rather strange ending.<BR> The Setting was in one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, Vienna. The settings and scenery were more than accurate; the Theater's backdrops were lacking the certain amount of details you would expect them to lack. The town looked like Vienna, probably was, and the street scenes made it look like it was the renaissance.<BR> Another thing about the street scenes were the costumes. All the extras had adequate costumes. The main charter's costumes were slightly overdone, but still pretty good. <BR> As for the casting and acting, it was astounding. I love the fact \\"Beatlejuice\\" played the king and the casting for Mozart, I always pictured him to look like that. And for the Acting, it blew my mind how well Mrs. Mozart did the background actions like when she sneaks some more truffles from Soliert, which was probably the funniest thing in the film.<BR> As for the music, well edited into the film. It was smart to overlay the music they talked about, this movie was about Mozart! It definitely made the movie better.<BR> Overall the movie was grate, I fell anyone interested in music would like the movie and that's who I would recommend this movie to. That's who I fell this movie is a nine out of ten, not everyone would like it, but its still wonderfully done.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think it's an incredibly amazing c.d.  It's a whole different side to Britney.  The first album she was a girl.  This one she's not a girl, not yet a woman.  To say what my favorite song on the album is a little hard to do.  I mean everything on it it amazing.  I think everybody should own a copy.
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica's third release, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, is among the greatest metal albums ever recorded.  It is excellent both as a whole and as a collection of songs.  Seldom have I heard such an excellent combination of beautiful melody and driving-hard aggression.  Some bands lean too heavily on melody, and come off as soft. Others lean too much upon the latter, and degenerate into white-noise and ridiculous posteuring.  This disc rides the fines line between the two, never leaning to much either way.  The musicianship is of the first water, with Lars' signature drums and the wail of Kirk Hammett's lead.  While James Hetfield isn't the best singer on earth, he definitely gets the point across.  His gruff voice and melodic crooning go hand in hand with lyrics.  And Cliff's last performance on bass is truly admirable.  I shan't give a song-by-song analysis; every song is great.  One thousand words would not be enough.  If you don't believe me, look at the top of the page. Over 420 reviews and an average 5 stars!!  That alone should give you an idea of the sheer excellence of the album.  If you're a seasoned fan of true heavy metal, you most likely own this.  If you happen to be getting into this great but often neglected genre, buy this. And while you're at it, buy &quot;Number of the Beast&quot;,&quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes.&quot; You'll thank me later.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|The D don't let you down. It'd be well nigh impossible for The D to let you down. It's just not in their DNA. Some thoughts on the CD..'Explosivo' should have stayed acoustic. Adding all the instrumentation just made it sound like a novelty song and I stress to you, dear reader, that The D is NOT a novelty act. 'Wonderboy' would be lodged in the Billboard Top 5 right now, but most of America hasn't removed that corn-cob from their rear so that they might free up space in their ears. It's their loss. 'Friendship' should appeal to all those power-pop junkies out there, those Big Star and Raspberries vinyl snobs. 'Karate' is an oh-so-short but how-very-sweet lovesong for your worst enemy. And 'Double Team' is the incredible God-Like rockfest that no one on earth can do better. Sex supreme indeed.
0060254920|5.0|My oldest son, now 15, still knows the words by heart. My four-year-old daughter is learning them. Max is the not-so-bad monster in every little one; the one who is brave and wild and tender and imaginative all at once. He is the King of all wild things--and they love him, but not quite as much as his mother (who couldn't bring herself to REALLY send him to bed without anything to eat at all). <br />Enough with the PC rants about this book. Another reviewer said he was &quot;snotty&quot; and rude. Give me a break-what child isn't just a tiny bit too lippy on some days. It's life. The thing about the book is that while Max may be a little &quot;snotty,&quot; he's imaginative, alive, and still knows that even after being punished, his mother loves him 'best of all.' <br />The illustrations are beautiful. The story is terrific. And I'm glad to say it was the perfect snuggle-at-bedtime book for every one of my children. <br />And I have the words retained in memory forever. I'll someday chant them to my grandchildren.
6305537798|5.0|Well, while the fact that this is a movie full of Heathy goodness should be reason enough to see it, I must also point out that it is an excellent movie.  I don't think that putting a Shakespearian comedy into a modern high school movie could have been done any better.  The script was so well written!  And the acting, for the most part, is great, too.  And it's Heath Ledger.  *drool*
078062999X|4.0|If you were to watch only one of Shakespeare's works, it should be Hamlet. And while I won't say that this is the best performance and production of Hamlet ever made (anyone would have a difficult time making that claim) I will say that this is one of the most complete and rewarding productions currently on video. For us Hamlet fans, it is painful to see the work crushed into the constraint of a two hour (or less) movie. Branagh, as usual, delivers a production with an extraordinary attention to detail, a fascinating cast, and a thought-provoking interpretation. The studio really needs to work to get this released in a format (*cough* DVD) that can truly show the film as it deserves.
6305358613|4.0|...Cate Blanchet gives a nuanced, remarkable performance that redeems the story's slight distortion of history and actual facts.  As good as Gwyneth Paltrow was in &quot;Shakespere in Love,&quot; Cate Blanchett's performance was the better of the two and was far more deserving of an Academy Award.  Here's the story of Elizabeth's rise from a timid, unsure monarch to a powerful and confident Queen.  The film's history isn't always consistent with actual facts, but &quot;Elizabeth&quot; is a film that shouldn't be missed, largely due to Blanchet's performance.
B00005OM4N|5.0|well she did it again...all the haters and the critics were wrong, she is back and better than ever.  this cd is amazing and she is the next madonna, no doubt.  every song on here is really good but the stand-outs are &quot;im a slave 4 u&quot; &quot;overprotected&quot; &quot;not a girl&quot;, jeez they are all awesome so go out and buy this cd today!
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Okay, the first time I saw this movie I felt it lacked plot and character development, but it was visually stunning none the less. I liked it much better the second time around. Tomb Raider could be the next Indiana Jones, so too bad Lucas/Spielberg didn't direct it. Angelina Jolie is right on the money in terms of the look and feel of the character. Any problem with this film is not her fault. And when all is said and done, it was worth the price of admission just to watch her...........she is easy on the eyes! I play Tomb Raider all the time and I feel she was excellent. I just wish they would have made more scenes resemble the game or let her pick up a medpack and say &quot;Ah, ha&quot;. I do plan to buy this DVD.
B00005JKOV|4.0|and it was a movie called &quot; slacker &quot; where a camera just goes around from person to person and they expound on their philosophy of life or just rant about whatever's in their heart and mind. i have seen two of linklater's movies, &quot; slacker&quot; and &quot; dazed and confused &quot; and i think he is a brilliant filmmaker.this however is just a revision of &quot; slacker &quot; with some new wrinkles thrown in. i would have rated this film lower, but the animation is revolutionary. he shot the movie on film, then had animation done to the film. when i watched it, it was like a peter max cartoon coming to life, plus it was entertaining enough to make me forgive linklater's slight of hand...

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's third album is definetly filled with some of her best tracks. Tracks such as \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Overprotected\\" have the pop elements of hits on Oops!, but mature tracks such as the lead-off single, \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Boys\\", and \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", are perfect for the new image Britney portrays. On an odd side-note, \\"Anticipating\\" sounds like \\"All My Life\\" on Mariah Carey's flop-of-an-album, Glitter. (...)

B000002E5J|5.0|I had never heard of or thought of Shakira before.  My Spanish I teacher told us about her but still didn't really get into it.  I had never even heard her music either.  My teacher did an assignment that we had to listen to the song &quot;Estoy Aqu,&quot; and pic out the words that we already knew or something like that.  Ever since than everyone in my class wanted to listen to it all during class and we have if we have had extra time.  I bought the CD after looking all over for it and finally found it.  I listen to it every day even though i dont understand it all that well.  I am trying to translate the words taht i know or can find the english word for. Its kind of working but not too much. The CD &quot;Pies Decalzos&quot; is the best music in Spanish of all time. and Shakira really makes it totally piece together w/ the lyrics, melodies, and her beautiful voice.

B00005B36H|5.0|Laterlaus by Tool is definitely not for the Blink-182 fans of the world.  This is REAL music.  The textures and sounds that   Tool creates on this album are beyond incredible and completely unlike anything that has ever been created.  Everyone should wave goodbye to the ingenuous music that is being pushed upon us all nowadays.  If you like heavy music, this is perfect for you.  If you like progressive rock, this is perfect for you.  This album has a little something for every type of music fan.  From the opening odd time signature riff in &quot;Grudge&quot; to the spoken word oddity of &quot;Faaip De Oiad&quot;, this album will keep you hooked until the end.  <br />This album seems to focus more on a breakup between two people or perhaps a split of any kind.  The seamlessness with which the band flows from one song to another is absolutely incredible.  I would definitely recommend this album to anyone, unless you're a stickler for guitar solos and cheesy, shallow lyrics.  If you are that pathetic, I suggest you stay away from Tool so you don't end up ruining the experience for the rest of us.

0451527712|3.0|Sci Fi movie buffs may not recognize the original novel by Mary<br />Shelley, any more than movie goers would recognize the real Tarzan in ERB's debut book.  For this 1818 novel introduces us to a surprisingly articulate monster--who is never named by his idealistic young creator. Its antique literary style offers a  tale presented by three different first-person narrators. Letters (tales within a tale) are the inevitable legacy of suicide or premature death before the story is really over.<br /> In contrast, the basic theme appears remarkably modern, especially in the light of 21st century scientific debate over the inherent dangers of too much knowledge (as in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde)or genetic tampering (The Island of Dr. Moreau).  Man is simply not morally csapable to assume the role of creator.  Lofty-minded but overwrought Victor Frankenstein conceives the blasphemous idea of creating a living being of gigantic stature.  Despite his noble goal of benefitting mankind, the experiment goes grotesquely awry.  The youthful natural scientist endures a few years of tortured, morbid existence, which swell to a crescendo of horror as a result of his cerebral &quot;Hybris.&quot;<br />  Frankenstein's obsession gradually dominates his life--spilling blood onto those around him, as the people dearest to him are viciously and deliberately murdered.  Is there no way to stop the rampage of terror which he has inadvertantly unleashed upon a helpless, unsuspecting world?  Linked inexorably by the bonds of unholy creation, both Victor and his monster live only for Revenge.  But can either truly be said to be alive, if the other should perish? Are they not mutually dependent on each other to sustain the fires of the hunt?  Despite uneven pacing, this thriller/chilller has captured the imagination of kids of all ages for almost two centuries. Bear in mind that Hollywood has transformed the original monster, spawning the idea that Frankenstein Is the monster!
B000002IOW|5.0|Typical of many modern day &quot;rock&quot; fans, some people just don't like change, any type of experimentation by a band is met with fierce opposition and condemnation. People cried out in horror when Springsteen recorded &quot;Nebraska&quot;, but now many believe that album to be one of his finest works...the same with &quot;Presto&quot;, sorry &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; fans..there's no &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; or &quot;Limelight&quot; on this one, but what you get is maybe even better. You hear a band that has matured, that isn't afraid to explore new territory and try different directions. I mean isn't this the same band that followed up the hard rock monster &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; with a synthesizer driven &quot;Signals&quot;?? Yet ask any Rush fan what their favorite songs are and you're sure to hear &quot;Subdivision&quot; and &quot;The Analog Kid&quot; included in that list. On &quot;Presto&quot; how anyone can disregard the emotional impact of a song like &quot;The Pass&quot; which deals with the terrible blight of teenage suicide, is beyond me. Obviously &quot;Show Don't Tell&quot; is a concession to the &quot;play only the hits&quot; crowd, but other tracks such as &quot;Superconductor&quot; &amp; the title track are up there with any of the Rush &quot;classics&quot;. Many people berate and complain about this period of Rush's career (ie. &quot;Roll The Bones&quot; &amp; &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;) but I believe that these albums constitute some of the highlights of Rush's musical history. Its so easy for some to compare and criticize Rush albums, but each stands on its own and should be judged on its own. How exactly is one supposed to compare an early guitar heavy album such as &quot;Fly By Night&quot; with a contemporary one like &quot;Roll The Bones&quot; or &quot;Test for Echo&quot;. Rush's strength is their diversity and ability not to mired in a boy-bandish never-changing formula that gets old quickly. The &quot;Where Are They Now File&quot;is full of bands and acts that never dared to explore new ideas and stuck with a simple approach. &quot;Presto&quot; is Rush at their finest.
B00000JFV9|5.0|Curtis Mayfield was a genius, and it shows on this soundtrack.  Not a bad cut to be found on here.  &quot;No Thing On Me&quot; is one of my favorites, an uplifting, anti-drug song.  &quot;Give Me Your Love&quot; is known as a popular steppers (a style of dancing) cut here in Chicago.  You will not be disappointed in this feast of 1970s soul music.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Having listened to Britney's first two albums and thinking this girl had no chance of becoming the next Madonna, I have to say that this is the album that has changed my mind.<BR>Sure, she's pure pop product, but she's growing up and this is not just determined by her ever-growing breasts and determined virginity pledges.  Britney co-writes most of her songs for the first time and I think one truly gets a sense of the girl behind the music with these new tracks.<BR>There is the sexually rampant, (but still a virgin, hmmmm . . .) Britney cooing sensual words in &quot;I'm a slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot; &amp; &quot;Bombastic Love.&quot;  <BR>Then there is the playful pop star singing one of the best tracks of the album, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Anticipating&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;That's were you take me.&quot;<BR>Seriously talented Brit Brit throws in the occasional ballad with &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; and &quot;When I found you.&quot;  She's also experimenting with the hip-hop vibe in &quot;What it's like to be me&quot;, tries her hand yet again at a cover in &quot;I love rock and roll (much better than Satisfaction)&quot; &amp; a bit of the glitch and garage music with &quot;When I found you.&quot;  <BR>This album gives you a lot of things, granted its all good fun but if you take and recieve it that way you will get a lot more from it.  If Britney had come out in the 80s she would have blended in with the crowd of blonde bombshells in ripped jeans and tiny tanks, but now she can be perceived as a marketing product who has been poked and propped to perfection, but Britney really is fun if you see her that way.  You just have to understand she is under the stigma of a contract like Madonna was, and has to sing to a large extent what she is told to.  But with more longer star staying power under her belt hopefully we'll go on to recieve great albums like this from britney.<BR>I believe once she becomes &quot;unprotected&quot; she will unleash a talent and surviving power that is as good as those funky outfits she wears!  Madonna move over . . .
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok, the new record of this very hot chick is far far away from the other two... it's like, in this one, she is herself with all the words. Tracks like &quot;Overprotected&quot; or &quot;I'm Not A Girl...&quot; are very personals, and very explosives... but in this CD the electric guitarrs, and the funk and soul sounds are not all.<BR>Britney shows that is growing a lot more since her debut, and she's not the little school girl anymore. Her music it´s more mature and solid, &quot;I´m A Slave 4 U&quot; it´s a good exemple... songs like, &quot;Boys&quot; y &quot;Lonely&quot; are simply excelent... and the cover for &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot;... no words, just great. Great CD, solid and powerfull music and a great singer... get it now, seriously!.
0452282152|4.0|Tracy Chevalier does a beautiful job bringing the main character to life, to such an extent that by the end of the book, you can almost see Griet stepping down out of the painting in full, vibrant, three dimensionality.  While telling a rich and detailed story, Chevalier weaves in complex social issues that create a commen thread between Griet and today's women.  Just like the time-intensive oil portraits which are painstakingly created layer by layer, Chevalier has created, word by word,  a sensitive and touching picture of a girl with heart, morals, and determination.  Don't pick this book up if you crave action packed excitement.  But if you want to immerse your senses in a world long-past, Chavalier will captivate you.
B00005JKHP|2.0|Well,I may have been expecting to much,but I was somewhat disapointed with this DVD.Being a Star Trek fan since I was about 5 years old(I am now 27)I remember seeing the motion picture for the first time and the overwhelming feeling of excitement that I felt,but anyway on with the review.I was disapointed mainly because,for 1,all the deleted scenes that are included have all been seen before,either in the special extended VHS version or on the Television version,this to me was a total letdown.The documentarys are o.k.,the one about star trek phase II is way to short and hardly shows any footage from the show that was supposed to be.The biggest addition in my opinion was the trailers and the television commercials,these are absolute classics and were a treat to see again.As for the movie itself,the inclusion of the new special effects was O.K.,but some things,like the new alert sound,drove me nuts,the old alert sound demanded attention,this new one is pathetic,also they toyed with the warp drive sound,and the v`ger bolt firing sound,which in my opinion were better before they were altered for this new version.All in all this was a decent effort,but it honestly did not live up to my expectations,and sttmp is probobly my 2nd fav star trek movie.
6304681011|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SUCH A BLAST FROM THE PAST-I JUST LOVE IT.  IT IS STILL VERY SPOOKY.  I REMEMBER SEEING CARNIVAL OF SOULS IN THE EARLY 60'S...JUST THE ORGAN MUSIC WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME SHAKE.  I ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR AMUSEMENT PARKS AND THIS MOVIE ALWAYS SEEMS TO POP INTO MY HEAD WHEN THEY CLOSED DOWN FOR THE SEASON.<br />IF YOU LOVE THE OLD BLACK AND WHITE HORROR MOVIES AS I DO, YOU WILL LOVE CARIVAL OF SOULS.
B00004WGAA|5.0|I can only imagine how this movie must have seemed in 1962 upon release- nearly 40 years later it creeped jaded (and click on my &quot;about me&quot; link to see how jaded and mean I can be) me right out.  Yes, a modern audience will see the ending coming from about 50 miles away.  Yes, it was clearly made for about the price of a happy meal.  And yes, some of the acting is so stiff you will wonder if everyone in town is recently embalmed.  But there is a pervasive creepiness that is captured in this movie, and a real beauty as well.  The Carnival itself is fantastic- I'd love to know what happened to it.  It looks like something that has been deserted for eons, and the lunar-looking shores of the Great Salt Lake add to the weird atmosphere.<br />Pop this one in the machine late one night, lower the lights and enjoy.  You WILL be creeped out!
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture Director's Edition is a revelation. Who knew that a few cuts in all the right places, some added effects (that do not distract from the original film) and revamped sound effects could turn the flawed, slow-paced original cut into a great film? It's so clear now that this is a film about Kirk, Spock and V'Ger, three troubled beings searching for answers. The movie was so long before you forgot what it was about. The scenes now have tension and drama in all the right places, where originally they were vague and flat with way too much technical dialogue and special effects shots (all available on the supplement disc for true purists, including the excruciating V'Ger fly-throughs). It all makes sense now, and is a much more fast-paced and exciting movie.     <br />Robert Wise's commentary mentions that this was the only film he's ever done that received no test screening and he thinks they would have said &quot;more with the characters, less with special effects.&quot; But the film was rushed into theaters instead, leaving the film unfinished in the director's eyes. I am thrilled that he got the chance to revisit and correct the problems with the film. Well worth checking out.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Guy Pearce (L.A. Confidential) is outstanding in this hypnotic film noir that is simply one the best films of 2001. The film is told in reverse but the neat thing about the DVD is that you watch the film in order. It's totally up to you. But if you want an interesting ride where you have to pay close attention to every aspect of the film then watch it as the director intended.......in reverse ! Carrie-Anne Moss (Chocolat, The Matrix) has one of her juiciest roles to date as a &quot;femme fatale&quot; in this excellent thriller. One of her best lines in the film is, &quot;You sad, sad freak.&quot; You get to see another dimension to her skills as an actress that you've never seen before. If you've seen the film then you know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, you will have to buy or rent the movie to find out. Joe Pantoliano (Bound) is equally compelling in his supporting role. Be sure not to miss this entertaining and thought-provoking film. This movie is for people who get sick of boring, cliche' mainstream films and want something that'll make them think.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  I had only heard &quot;Why Does it Always Rain on Me&quot; before randomly buying this CD and I was definately happily surprised.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This is actually a pretty good follow up to the smash cd, \\"oops i did it again\\". <BR>Slave 4 U- 4/5 Good, funky beat, first single<BR>Overprotected- 5/5 BEST song on the entire cd. Funkay , unique song<BR>Lonley- 4/5 Very good song, reminds me of something michael jackson would produce..<BR>Im not a girl, not yet a woman- 4/5 good ballad-ish type song about independence<BR>Boys - 4/5 very slick, sexy song about well..boys<BR>Anticipating- 3/5 i do not like this song at all. it sounds way too disco-ish for somebody like britney...even too disco-ish for the bee gees..<BR>I love rock and roll - 3/5 she attempts to cover this song, but does not pull it off well at all. very reptative, stick to your own pop.<BR>Cinderella - 4/5 i really like this song, something you wouldnt think britney would sing..<BR>Let me be - 3/5 OK song, more like a b-side single for her, or a song that a 1-hit wonder would sing<BR>Bombastic Love- 2/5 Skip it..<BR>Thats where you take me- 2/5 reminds me of a generic lullaby<BR>Thats where you take me 5/5 gotta love this song, except for justins beatboxing..<BR><BR>Overall, its a pretty good cd, good enough to buy.
B0000019HU|5.0|A friend loaned me this cd years ago, and I fell in love.<br />He said, &quot;The 'i miss you's always get me.&quot;<br />When I returned the cd to him, I immediately went out and bought it.  It was around the holiday season at the time, and a woman near me in line heard me gushing over the cd.  She asked of me and the friend who was with me &quot;I have a daughter who is about your age.  Do you think she would like this cd?&quot;  My friend and I looked at each other.  We asked the woman what kind of music her daughter liked.  The woman didn't know.  We told her that her daughter probably wouldn't like the cd.<br />Why?<br />We were seventeen at the time, and I don't think your average seventeen year old who listens to whatever plays on mainstream radio will like Slint.  That's just me though.<br />In my case, I come back to Slint regularly.  Always marvelling at their quiet intensity that culminates in the &quot;I miss you's&quot; at the end of Good Morning, Captain.  <br />The &quot;I miss you's&quot; always get me.
B00005OM4N|2.0|From the moment I heard &quot;I'm a slave 4 u&quot; I couldn't wait to get Britney's new cd. I was thinking it might be more of an R&amp;B-ish type sound. When I got the cd, the day it came out, I rushed home to listen to it. After track 1, my opinion of the cd pretty much went downhill. There are songs that sound like disco, wanna-be rock songs, and just plain corny ones.  Out of the twelve, I liked 5. That's pretty bad. Here's my advice: I'm not going to tell you not to buy this. If you don't mind a completely different and odd sound, this is a good cd. But if you were hoping for something a little less rock and a little more R&amp;B/pop, just be forwarned that this cd isn't what you're expecting.P>2. Overprotected - 10/10<BR>Britney mentions she can take care of herself and does not need anyone to control her life. A strong and positive song. I like it very much.<br />3. Lonely - 9.5/10<BR>One of the songs that Britney co-wrote and *darn* she did a pretty good job at it! Very catchy!<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman - 11/10<BR>A very, very beautiful ballad, and unfortunately, the only one on her album. Here in this song, she sings that she isn't a girl no more, and is on her way making her own decisions as a woman. A very mature song that you should not pass up.<br />5. Boys - 10/10<BR>Boys... I love them! Er... I meant the song! ^_^ Actually, the song is about how she sees a guy and wants to dance with him or something. Anyways, it seems this is almost everyone's fav. from my view, but I'll let you decide!<br />6. Anticipating 11/10<BR>One of those songs that deserve higher than 10. I absolutely adore this song! It's so cute and fun, and cheers me up when I'm down! Very catchy. I find myself singing it everywhere I go. Actually, the darn thing is still in my head.<br />7. I Love Rock & Roll 9.5/10<BR>I was slightly disapointed with Rodney J.'s production with the song. I found it wasn't very rockish, and it included more of a R&Bish sound. However, it isa very good remake, none-the-less, and don't let the review scare you! It's really catchy and nobody could redo the song better than Britney! <br />8. Cinderella 12/10<BR>Alright. Cinderella is by far one of the most interesting songs on her 'Britney' album. Especially the chorus near the end. I even sometimes get goosebumps by listening to it. Really, it's kind of hauntingly sweet, and the song is very, very good, even 'til the end.<br />9. Let Me Be 10/10<br />This song probably has the most intelligent lyrics on her album. It's a about how this guy doesn't believe she can't go on her  own, and she will not look back at the past and is completely different. Word of Advice: Let Britney Be, and you'll have a happy Britney. Also, this song is featured on the On The Line soundtrack. Neat.<br />10. Bombastic Love 9/10<BR>My least favourite song, but good, nonetheless. It kinda reminds me of old school Shaggy sometimes.<br />11. That's Where You'll Take Me<br />Ahh... love. Wait. Hasn't love been one of the conflicts Britney has faced in her songs thus far? Well, this song is very nice a dreamy-like. I would of classified this as a ballad, but the rhythm is mid-tempo so... <br />12. What It's Like To Be Me<BR>Britney's 'Britney' finale is an upbeat song, written by no other than Justin Timberlake! (oohs & aahs) This song is how she challenges the guy. If he wants to be hers, he has to know what she does for a living. As in 'walk a mile in my shoes' and 'if you don't like what I do, go away' kind of attitude.<br />If you don't have it, buy it. No regrets.
080013799X|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is in my opinion one of the funniest movies of all time. I recently took my daughter to see a re-release and she liked it too. You have to have a twisted sense of humor to really enjoy it. I saw it when it first came out. That was a few years ago. The Black Knight scene is probably one of the most bizzare pieces of film in existence. \\"Your arm's off, you stupid b(...)\\".  \\"No, it isn't, it's only a flesh wound. I've 'ad worse. Come on you, pansy\\".
B00005R23S|5.0|I got this DVD the first day it came out. It's incredible. Beautifully filmed, a great selection of songs, great audio...I went to four of the shows on this tour, including the last one (at which this DVD was filmed), and this comes very close to capturing what it's like to be at a Springsteen concert. If you don't have a DVD player, here's your reason for getting one.
B00003CY0V|1.0|Written in a non-linear fashon, the movie picks up about 3/4th the way through, showing the &quot;big explosion&quot; right off the top. The effects was certainly the best of a otherwise hum drum year, but it all goes down hill from there.<BR>  Nothing original here, leaving no cliche plot device untouched. Seriously, this is two hours of my life I'll never get back.<BR>  If you want to watch some edgy film style, watch memento. If you want to watch a Hacker movie, see the Matrix again. If you want to watch somehting that just shuts your brain off, pick up anything else, but do yourself a favor on this one.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I just finished watching the newly revised dvd edition, and I'm happy to now see this movie as it was meant to be - a nicely finished, polished project with more depth and continuity. The team that worked on this has thankfully avoided the pitfalls of cgi overkill that plauged the Star Wars re-releases a few years ago. The new effects are so seamless, and the new cgi scenes are incredible. I only noticed some depth of field shots that were way to blurry on some of the newly modified enterprise bridge scenes. The only other thing which is hard to control - is some of the original matted shots are so sharp now - that the various camera passes that were then optically printed 22 years ago(the light's, then the model)are mismatched a bit. This is noticeable when the Enterprise has just cleared her moorings and passes by earth with the sunrise in the background - look at the saucer dish to see what I'm talking about.<br />V'ger is finally shown in its entirety - thanks to quality and tastelful cg modelling - jaw dropping! Minor details - such as new backgrounds in the lounge windows, people's faces in portholes, the incredibly great soundmix that gives that right amount of punch and effect in various places- I'm speechless. I never expected the result to be this good. The team that did this put a lot of time and thought into these shots. This is also due to Wise's direction and vision of what he ultimately wanted 22 years ago. It's too bad that Trumbel and Dykstra were so hampered for time when the film was originally made. Now, the film is everthing it was meant to be. The steps to V'ger from the enterprise being built by particles..... incredible touch!<br />If you were already a fan of this movie or just want to give it another chance - you owe it to yourself to get this, especially at such a great price. The experience is well worth it!<br />Chris
B00005A1PR|5.0|This CD is fantastic I have fallen madely deeply in love with it.  It is so positive and just inspirational.  I am so happy that she has come along. I am a fan for life.  I recommend everyone go out and buy it.  It is superb.  I love that fact that she is so spirtual.  I cannot praise it enough.  India God bless you girl.  she has given us women something to listen other than what is out here.  I certainly am not knocking anyone else or genre but I welcome the change.  Well, that has been my 2 cents. She is awesome ya'll go out and get the CD
0767819594|3.0|It's probably better if you haven't seen Stephen Frears's Dangerous Liaisons (1989), starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer, or Milos Forman's Valmont (1988) with Annette Bening, Colin Firth and Meg Tilly.  If you have, Roger Kumble's Cruel Intentions (1999), starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Reese Witherspoon, which is also based on the novel by the Frenchman Choderlos de Laclos, will seem to lack finesse.  Kumble wrote his own screenplay as a kind of Les Liaisons Dangereuses in modern dress, whereas Frears and Forman relied more heavily upon the stage play by Christopher Hampton, depicting the aristocracy of 18th century France.  While the two earlier movies sparkle with wit, insight and a cynicism to chill the fondest heart, Kumble's venture features a more prosaic brand of sexual humor adorned agreeably with young, nubile bodies.<br />But there is no need to make odious comparisons.  Cruel Intentions can stand on its own, and there is plenty to admire, especially Gellar in a role to which she is perfectly suited, and Witherspoon as well.  Phillippe is also good, especially when he's being funny, although his unconscious imitation of John Malkovich was a bit obsequious.  He delivered some of his lines with the same deadpan expression and intonation.  But being as pretty as he is, Phillippe's character is more like Colin Firth's.  Selma Blair's narrow-eyed and dotty Cecile was pretty, sexy, and funnier than either Uma Thurman or Fairuza Balk, who played  similar roles in the above mentioned movies, respectively.<br />The scene with the shrink to begin was very agreeable and should have been followed up somehow.  We never see Sebastian quite so diabolical later on.  Too bad.  And seeing a little more of Swoosie Kurtz who played the self-centered, phony and hypocritical Dr. Regina Greenbaum would have enhanced the film.<br />The idea of making Sebastian and Kathryn step siblings was amusing and spicy, and the inclusion of a raunchy gay footballer was appropriate.  Using a black guy as Cecile's harp teacher was kinky good.  And being rather up-front about sex throughout without being overly juvenile was refreshing.  The business with Sebastian Valmont's diary of conquests worked well both psychologically and as a plot device.<br />The main failing with Kumble's movie, aside from the general superficiality, was that Sebastian's \\"conquest\\" of Annette was a little too easy, especially with the goody-goody build-up she had been given.  Consequently, her falling in love was more like a stumble.  There was some physical passion, but nothing like the full-blown emotional passion required.  Also I think the ending needed a little work.  It seemed that a committee divined it, part of them wanting a \\"happy\\" love ending for Reese and Ryan, and the other half wanting to stay somewhat true to the spirit of the original, and so they came to a compromise, as committees will, and we got mishmash.<br />Incidentally, there is yet a fourth movie version of this tale, Dangerous Liaisons (1960), from French director Roger Vadim.  I am looking forward to seeing it, if I can find a copy.unchy gay footballer was appropriate.  Using a black guy as Cecile's harp teacher was kinky good.

0316743003|4.0|I picked this book up after having read Don DeLillo's Libra, which pictures the protagonist, Lee Harvey Oswald, at a USAF base in Atsugi, Japan during his military service. The U2 spy plane that was based there definitely adds to the aura of mystery and fatefulness that pervades the whole of DeLillo's excellent novel and aroused my curiosity. Rich's account of the Skunk Works' history entirely satisfied my interest in this mysterious airplane. The book can be read in different ways: as a thrilling account of the Cold War, a captivating portrait of the complex  and brilliant designer Kelly Johnson, and as a treatise on corporate innovation, cutting edge management methods and industry-government relationships. I found the book to be exceedingly well written, with just the right dosage of technical details, humour, personal anecdotes and historical drama. The integration of 'other voices' from test pilots, high level policy makers and air force top brass complements Rich's narrative nicely and helps in modulating the sometimes breathless pace. An excellent book. I enjoyed it a lot.
B00005N83M|3.0|A good dance album and better than the last. If she keeps building herself up with dance tracks she might even get up to 4 stars on her next album if she can last that long and doesn't revert back to her first album.
B00005OM4N|5.0|She is awesome!  When she is performing, all you can do is sit there and watch in ahhhhh.  This album is the best yet...  I totally recommend it to anyone.  If my boyfriend likes it, anyone will like it.  She is the &quot;Next Madonna&quot;.  Buy it.
B00005NB0H|5.0|In 1970 I was only a year old, so due to age and distance (living in the US), I was unable to witness one of the all-time great rock concerts ever performed.  I was in Leeds in 1988.  Michael Jackson was in town, but I was 18 years too late to see The Who.  <br />Now, thanks to the miracle of modern recording/digital technology, I can be transported back in time and listen to a piece of history.  The sound quality of this CD is amazing.  I don't know what the original LP sounded like, but this sounds so sharp and clear that if you didn't know it was recorded in 1970, you'd swear it was a recent recording! <br />I'd always heard that this was considered to be one of the best live rock albums ever and after listening to it, I have to say that this assessment is correct.  The thunderous drumming, the chugging base lines and ferocious guitar work of Keith, John and Pete, respectively, are awesome to listen to.  Each plays their own instruments like a lead instrument, yet they all blend perfectly together without one overshadowing the other.  Combined with Roger Daltrey's power vocals, the combined effect is truly stunning. <br />Any fan of real rock, music history or students of the drum/bass/guitar, should give this a listen.  It's well worth it!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd changed the world of music. Their odd way of arranging songs and strange guitar riffs backed by the brilliant lyrics of Roger Waters was more unique than anything. This album, from Shine on You Crazy Diamond, Another Brick in the Wall (PT II), Money, and Time couldn't be a better collection of their music. MUST GET for all pink floyd fans

B00003CXXJ|5.0|&quot;Shrek&quot; is very funny, and is probably the best movie I've seen this year. The extra features are also very fun including two short documentaries (together equal apx 1 hr); humorous &quot;interviews&quot; with the cast: Shrek, Princess Fiona, &amp; Donkey; and music videos. An added plus is disc 1 has the full-frame version, and disc 2 has the widescreen version. It also has some funny games, many of which you must do with a DVDrom drive.<br />The only flaw is the promotional sticker on the front of the case. Unlike usual DVDs which put stickers on the shrink wrap, this movie has the sticker directly on the case. I (foolishly) attempted to remove it, and just made more sticky residue. I suggest you purchase this DVD [it's great] and then contact DreamWorks (the studio which released this DVD) at (972) 293-5903 and request a replacement case as I have done.<BR>...then you can have your cake and eat it too.
B000002TLX|4.0|For some somewriters, making it in the music business can be very difficult. One example of those lyricists is Richard Marx. Throughout the 80's and 90's, Richard Marx pounded out massive hits to top the charts. This collection cements his status as a guilty pleasure. His songs touch the right kind of notes, especially his standard, Right Here Waiting, which is still being played on Jukeboxes and radio stations across the across the country.<br />In fact, he had been turned down by every record label at least twice. But his wait was really worth it. Hold On To The Nights, and Angel's Lullaby, catch simple and honest songs that keep telling hope and love for years to come. Richard Marx is the luckiest struggling singer/songwriter in music.
B000002G8L|5.0|Definitivamente, a mi gusto de lo mejor de Clapton como solista.  Que suerte tuvo esa gente de Tokio de estar en ese concierto!.  Contiene msica para todos los gustos, rock and roll, blues, baladas, en fin, una maravilla. &quot;Blues Power&quot;, &quot;After Midnight&quot;, &quot;Cocaine&quot; y &quot;Further Up on the road&quot; te haran transportar a otra dimensin.  Es un disco obligado en cualquier coleccin.
B00000694T|3.0|This movie was filmed in my hometown in Washington state. I got to see part of it being filmed. The diner in the film, where Julianne Moore works, is my brother in law's. So, needless to say, this interesting film hits close to our hearts. In the film, Johnny Depp stars as an eccentric character who goes to live with Benny(Aidan Quinn), and his mentally unstable sister Joon(Mary Stuart Masterson). You see, Benny lost a poker game and had to take Sam(Depp)in. That part is a little hokey. The two eccentric characters of Sam and Joon click and start a secretive relationship. They don't want big brother Benny to find out. There are a few delightful moments of whimsical silliness that makes this movie quite charming. Depp showcases his brilliant talent for physical comedy. His Buster Keaton routine is priceless. His Chaplin shtick in the diner is a classic. By the way, the jukebox in the diner was a prop. It's not ours. Masterson is quite effective as Joon. They are both very believeable. Aidan Quinn is solid as the overprotective brother Benny. A good performance. Dan Hedaya and CCH Pounder also star. The movie was directed by Jeremiah Chechick, who also did &quot;National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation&quot;. This is a sweet little movie with a sweet little story. Might want to check it out.

This songs proves that she is a diva! The 2nd single for the album!<br />&quot;Boys&quot;-<BR>This is probably the song I won't listen to that often. It has a beat that I'm not into and I am a guy!

It's like their &quot;No Strings Attatched&quot; kind of song. A great way to end the album.<br />Their were 23 songs in this recording session. These 12 made the cut. On the imporst their is &quot;Intimidated&quot; and &quot;Before The Goodbye&quot;, I have yet to hear!<br />We all know their are teenage girls who say they don't like Spears, but we don't know who buys all her CD's now, do we?<br />I am a HUGE Spears fan, I own all her albums, import albums, singles, videos, you name it!<br />Britney, thanks for this album!<br />FOLKS...this proves Britney will be around for another 40 years!<br />Alex
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is a great CD. The best song on the album in my opinion is &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman.&quot; This song was co-written by Dido and is the sole ballad on the CD. The CD is worth it for this ballad alone. <BR>The song &quot;Boys&quot; almost sounds like something Prince would write and produce--it's a definite change from Britney's style on her first 2 CD's. It's a funky sexy dance song that is already growing on me after one day. <BR>Britney's cover of Joan Jett's &quot;I love rock n' roll&quot; is brilliant. There's just something about Britney's voice that allows her to pull off this cover with ease--making it sound even sexier than the original.<BR>Justin Timberlake's vocals on &quot;What it's like to be me&quot; will be a treasure for fans of both *NSYNC and Britney. His vocals add a very cool touch to the song and complement Brit's vocals rather well.<BR>There's also a couple of techno sounding songs such as &quot;That's where you take me.&quot; Very cool for dance music fans!<BR>There's something for everyone on this CD.<BR>Overall this is an A+ album that I think will do very well for Britney.
0446310786|5.0|I just finished this book a few moments ago, and I am completely awed by this story.  Harper Lee has done an excellent job bringing this 1930s Alabama childhood to life.  I can see why To Kill a Mockingbird has won the Pulitzer Prize, garnered an Academy Award for the movie version, and ultimately become a timely classic enjoyed by many generations.<br />To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of two children, sister Scout and brother Jem, and their childhood during three years in the midst of the Great Depression.  Scout and Jem spend most of their summers with their summer-neighbor, Dill, making up plays and spying on the town recluse, Boo Radley.  During the school year (minus Dill, who goes back home to Mississippi), Scout finds herself in trouble one too many times and struggles with the concept of being a lady, especially when all she wants to do is wear overalls and beat up her classmates.<br />Then everything changes one fall....  Scout and Jem's father, Atticus Finch, a lawyer in their town of Maycomb, Alabama, is appointed to the defense of Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman (although not of the highest caliber), Mayella Ewell.  The fact of this case rocks the town of Maycomb, and with Scout and Jem feeling the brunt of their classmates ridicule when they realize Atticus is on Tom's side.<br />I was simply floored while reading this novel.  I wasn't expecting a &quot;classic&quot; to be so readable.  Now I know what I've been missing!  To Kill a Mockingbird is a piece of our American history that depicts racism and prejudice, childhood innocence, and the perseverence of a man who risked it all to stand up for what he believed in.  Wonderful portrayal and one I will read again.
B000001ELL|3.0|Mi verdadera clasificacin es 31/2 estrellas.  Este disco marca el inicio de la influencia pop del Kiss (particularmente prefiero al Kiss ms pesado).  A pesar de todo ello, este disco contiene buenas canciones, desde el gran suceso &quot;I was made for loving you&quot; (una de mis favoritas en los aos 80), &quot;2000 man&quot; de los Rolling Stones, por supuesto mucho mas pesada que la version original, &quot;Charisma&quot; de Gene Simmons, no es lo mejor que hizo, pero no es desestimable, &quot;Magic Touch&quot;, una cancin muy tpica de Paul, una especie de balada pesada; algo que se volvi muy repetitivo en los discos siguientes y &quot;Save your love&quot; de Ace, que curiosamente tuvo la oportunidad de incluir tres canciones con su voz en este y en el disco de &quot;Unmasked&quot;, eso tomando en cuenta que en todos los discos anteriores habia grabado solo dos canciones (&quot;Shock Me&quot; y &quot;Rocket Ride&quot; del Alive II).
B00005OM4N|4.0|When Britney Spears said that her third album would be more mature than her first two, she wasn't kidding.  She really steps it up a notch in this third album which, appropriately enough, is entitled &quot;Britney.&quot;<br />Here are a few key highlights concerning this CD:<br />1) Britney co-wrote 5 of the 12 songs on the CD.<br />2) This CD is enhanced, so when you pop it into your little hard drive, a screen comes up that contains an exclusive video to the song, &quot;Overprotected.&quot;  This music video also contains outtakes from the upcoming movie she is starring in early next year.<br />3) There is a pull-out poster in the little booklet that comes in the CD case.  One side is of Britney, and the other side is like a mini-poster with many screen shots from the upcoming movie she is starring in early next year.<br />So what did I like about this CD?  As it pertains to effort, you can't deny it that.  Britney Spears is certainly trying in the songs she helped to write, and you can't fault her for lack of effort.  She serves up some fresh twists, and maybe once I listen to the CD for the second time, I'll come to get a better feel for them.  As it pertains to the songs, track number 4 (&quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;) seems to be my favorite track on the album right now.  It's the only song that resembles a ballad on the track, as most everything else is very much more pop/R&amp;B like.<br />Britney also uses a few choice words in a few of her songs.  This is nothing new for music artists, but coming from our little Britney, it is kind of surprising!  But she warned us that the third album is definitely more grown up than the first two, and she wasn't kidding.<br />Overall, I thought this CD was pretty good.  I've only listened to it one time, so I haven't exactly gotten the feel for it yet.  It takes a little while for things to grow on me, and I'm sure this new adult-Britney style will catch on soon enough.

B00004WG2X|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but i kept feeling like the characters where not what i portrayed them to be. I really disliked Mr.Darcy in the movie. He walked so unnaturally. I thought that his character didn't go through the great change that it should have gone through by the end. I thought Garvie played Elizabeth quite well, but I think she cried too much, she was way too sensitive. I thought of her as a much stronger character.<br />Wickham seemed so devious at the beginning as well, he just didn't seem as likeable as in the book when you first meet him. Charlotte and Elizabeth seemed to have no problem with each other after Charlotte married Mr.Collins, but in the book, they drifted from each other a bit.<br />One of the things, is I can't stand to be influenced by the movie. I don't want to think of the characters in such a way, which is definitely not the objective in making a movie based on a book. I feel it would ruin the book's well written characters. <br />They changed some of the scenes. They cut out some of the people, like when Eliza went to visit Charlotte, she was supposed to come with Charlotte's dad, and sister. And Eliza was supposed to cry, &quot;Oh thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!&quot; when she read the letter she left Mrs. Forster.<br />My favourite character in the movie was Lady Cathrine de Bourgh. I really did like the way they portrayed her. I laughed out loud when I heard her butting into the conversations.<br />Overall it was good, but not great. I'd watch it again, but not for a long, long time.
B000002VCT|5.0|If I were to recommend one APP album to a first-time listener, &quot;Pyramid&quot; would be the one. The third album in APP's initial album trilogy, &quot;Pyramid&quot; is heavily influenced by the Beatles (not surprising, as Parsons was an engineer on their Abbey Road album). In fact, one can easily hear Paul McCartney singing lead vocals on tunes like &quot;What Goes Up Must Come Down&quot; or &quot;Shadow of a Lonely Man,&quot; while John Lennon's more acerbic vocal take would fit quite nicely on &quot;You Can't Take It With You.&quot; All the songs on this album are highly melodic, with creative surprises in mid-section that strongly recall the Beatles' song arrangements. The real gem here is the haunting &quot;The Eagle Will Rise Again,&quot; sung beautifully by Colin Blunestone (ex-Zomibies vocalist). Not quite the commercial success as &quot;I Robot&quot; or the early-'80s APP albums, &quot;Pyramid&quot; still ranks as one of their best and is highly recommended. I've always thought that, had the Beatles stayed together throughout the '70s, they might have sounded something like this album. For anyone wishing to experience the &quot;progressive pop&quot; music of the late '70s, &quot;Pyramid&quot; is a great place to start.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Definitivamente el Maiden con Dickinson es otra cosa.  Cuando supe del lanzamiento del disco tenia muchas espectativas.  No solo por la presencia de su antiguo vocalista, sino por la vuelta de Adrian Smith. &quot;El Maiden con Bruce Dickinson y tres guitarras.  Wow!!.  Quizas por eso sea que le coloco 4 estrellas y no 5, esperaba demasiado.  De mis favoritas esta &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; y &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot;.  Son 10 canciones, pero el disco dura casi 70 minutos.  Las canciones son muy largas, sobre todos las ultimas, lo cual no es mis estilo (quizs sea por eso la estrella menos).
B00005QDW5|5.0|Every Floyd fan has his own version of the &quot;best of,&quot; so there's no real point in quibbling with the song selection here (having said that, where's &quot;Careful . . .&quot; or &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; or &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; or -- more controversially -- &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;?).  What is more troubling is the fact that &quot;Marooned&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; are both abbreviated to make room for other -- less good -- stuff (I guess).  Further, I don't understand the &quot;mixed as one continous experience&quot; business; it isn't any more &quot;continous&quot; than any other cd (check out the &quot;Fearless&quot; to &quot;Brain Damage&quot; segue on _Works_, for example), in other words, there are track breaks.  I gave it five stars because it is, after all, Pink Floyd, and it is all we're likely to get.  It isn't nearly as interesting as the last repackaging, _The Wall Live_, but is a good retrospective, probably more useful/beneficial to the new or curious fan.  Thanks to cd burners, we're all &quot;best of&quot; editors now.
B00003CXXS|5.0|I've already seen this movie 5 times in theaters and each time it gets better.  If you like scary dino movies than stick with THE LOST WORLD, but JP III is a good old fashioned B movie at its best with likeable characters, amazing effects, and roller-coaster ride sequences.  Not as amazing as it was back in 1994 with the first JP, but this new movie proves that if you work hard and put your heart and soul in it, even a Part 3 can be fun.
B00003CXFG|5.0|5 stars what more can I say? This movie happens to have my fav sci-fi plot.Land on a planet,find something strange ,try to figure it out and live through it.These kind of stories never get old to me.I started out reading them in the sixties in paperback before sci-fi was &quot;in&quot; and now they're making movies of them!What more could a fan ask?My rating on this one is purely subjective,but if you like pure action sci-fi this one will grab you.Vin Deisel is a natural.

B00005QG9J|3.0|I first became a fan of incubus back when S.C.I.E.N.C.E. came out. The song that made me think they were the greatest band was New Skin, then I got the album based on that and loved it. A Certain Shade of Green and Redefine were some of my favorite songs. So when Make Yourself came out I picked it up right away. I was somewhat dissapointed because there was only Privalege to satissfy the heavy side of me, but songs like Pardon Me and Drive were still really good and I was satisfied. Unfortunately, when I got morning view, there was still none of the incubus that got me hooked. I'm not asking for a hardcore metal album, just a couple songs along the lines of New Skin and A Certain Shade of Green. I appreciate the fact that they're trying to evolve their music, but just one or two songs can't be that hard to pull off.
0805066691|5.0|There is not much that has not already been said about Brown's devastating indictment of the US Government and their policy toward Native Americans.  In this masterful work, thoroughly researched and told in a heart-breaking manner, Dee Brown brings us face to face with our own shameful past.<br />Time and again, the greed and unfettered desire for westward expansion leads our government to make and break agreements with otherwise peaceful people.  Sadly, although the manner in which Native Americans are shuffled off their land form an all too familiar pattern, the story never seems stale or predictable.  Indeed, one is struck more by the sense of &quot;now what will they (the US government do) to act in an even more duplicitous manner.&quot;  While we may want to turn a blind eye to the actions of our government, after reading Brown's seminal work, you will be unable to look at things the same again.
B000002HHB|5.0|Natalie Merchant has made a subtle and beautifully introspective album with Tigerlily.  While a handful of the 11 songs are fairly upbeat, such as \\"Wonder\\" and the hit \\"Carnival,\\" most are quieter and more instrumentally subdued, giving Merchant's instantly recognizable voice plenty of room for expression.<br />Her wide-ranging, thoughtful lyrics are the perfect stage for that expression.  In \\"Beloved Wife,\\" about a man who is despairing over his wife's death, one can imagine the tears being held back.  The lengthy \\"I May Know the Word\\" has Merchant inside her own head, softly singing about the walls and demons in her mind.  Finally, the album's closer \\"Seven Years\\" brings her voice close to breaking as the anger toward an ex-lover is released.  All of these different moods are communicated perfectly by Merchant, and her voice adapts itself to every song, as does her tasteful piano and organ playing.  The backing band remains in good form throughout the CD, but never overshadows Natalie herself, which is how it should be.<br />Tigerlily is a high-quality release from a very talented singer-songwriter.  It's an excellent album for listening to on a quiet night and reflecting, as well as simply enjoying Natalie's voice - and it's definitely worth a spot in your CD collection.
B00002NDB1|3.0|.... no es un mal disco despues de todo.  Quizas sea la costumbre de tener al Dickinson como vocalista y por la presencia de &quot;Angel and the Gambler&quot;, una cancin que rompe con el estilo Maiden, puede ser, pero en lo que a mi respecta, me encanta, una cancin de ms de 9 minutos de duracin, tal vez, lo unico chocante sea esos sintetizadores que se escuchan de fondo.  El disco contiene canciones muy Maiden como &quot;Futureal&quot;, con la que abren el disco, rockera, un poco acelerada.  Tambin est &quot;The Clansmen&quot; y &quot;When Two Words Collide&quot; de lo ms rescatable del disco.  El resto es bastante flojo.

B00005QDW5|5.0|Pink Floyd is an extremely difficult band to do anything &quot;ordinary&quot; in a rock sense. Minimal interviews. Minimal portrayals of the band except through its classic iconography. Ambitious projects. Long instrumentals. Changing musical approaches.  And of course having fragmentation doesn't help either.<br />Now &quot;best of&quot; albums are usually recommended to the newcomers, adored by the record companies and frown on by the fans (except we poor fools pay for it at any rate). But this &quot;best of&quot; album excites me because: 1) Pink Floyd was heavily involved with it, 2) it takes into account with their entire career and 3) it's not an ordinary &quot;best of&quot; album. First off, the sleeve design makes it a testament/historical account of the Floyd in a very creative and interesting way (thank you Storm). And second, the tracklisting is non-chronological and they segue into each other.<br />Now I say it represents Pink Floyd with &quot;fair&quot; justice for the following reasons: the album still reflects the &quot;Great Floyd Schism&quot; between Roger Waters and David Gilmour (PF-1987) and the second is that gap between 1968 and 1972 when you have &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; instantly jumping into &quot;Meddle.&quot; The latter one kind of disappoints me because that era is just as important as &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or &quot;The Wall&quot; or even &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason.&quot; But I'll live because that era will not be for everyone.<br />This review is more for the new fans of the Floyd then for the old. But I hope this was useful for both.<br />And if anyone thinks (sarcastically) &quot;is this the best they [Pink Floyd] can do,&quot; believe me that this is better than nothing.<br />Shine on.

B00005OM4N|4.0|Ms. Spears is some what of a great actor. She has us believing she is an innocent &quot;girl&quot; who just happens to roll and growl better than a panther! Hay, it works and on her past disc's she never tried to change her sound or grow as an artist but somewhere down the line the kiddie audience she held captive left aand were replaced by grown-ups maybe the same grown-ups who embraced Madonna and on this new disc Ms. Spears has grown a few feet musicalliy! Her single &quot;I'm A Slave 4 u&quot;, with it's Prince like spelling is a hard hitting club thumping beat that has Ms. Spears whispering that we all &quot;wanna dance up on her&quot;. This track by its self is the best dance single of the year but the Neptunes who produced this album also contribute another ditty with the same ultra sexy vocals-that seem to just spin off the disc &quot;Boys&quot;.  Ms. Spears has also grown vocally while she will never be the next Celine, her only ballad &quot;I'm Not a girl...&quot; finds her singing with a new found assureness! The disc has it's weak spots the derrivative and corny &quot;What It's like to be me&quot; is just ear racking awful! But when an artist tries to hang on to her career with such verve and new found talent and conviction she has a chance of keeping it going! Let's face it she may have stole her steps from Janet Jackson and her persona from Madonna and her music from Abba and her vocals from Cher but when Ms. Spears stole she stole from some of the best!
B00000J2SR|3.0|The last Rainbow project prior to the Purple reunion in '84, Bent Out of Shape has taken some hard knocks over the years as the Rainbow album that finally degenerated the band to a second rate Journey-quality status (not saying that Journey is a bad band, mind you).  It's easy to why; the once majestic, bombastic and medieval rock has been totally replaced with a radio friendly pop sound here.  Ritchie had been pursuing this direction ever since late '78 when he hired Graham Bonnett on vocals for the Down to Earth project.  And when he acquired Joe Lynn Turner the year after that, the AOR deal was signed, sealed and delivered!<BR>     The previous year's Straight Between the Eyes hinted at what was to lie ahead.  Songs like &quot;Stone Cold&quot; and &quot;Rock Fever&quot; were definitely mainstream by any standards, let alone those of classic (Dio-era) Rainbow.  Bent out of Shape starts off with the fairly lackluster &quot;Stranded&quot; which seems to be lacking muscle and breadth, although it does contain a slippery atmospheric solo by the Man in Black.  The Rosenthal keyboard intro on &quot;Can't Let You Go&quot; is very cool, almost churchy, and reminds me a lot of Don Airey's on &quot;Centre of the Universe&quot; by Ozzy Osbourne's Bark at the Moon (also released in '83).  But things generally go up in a cloud of smoke for the rest of side one as &quot;Fool for the Night&quot; is color-by-numbers AOR and &quot;Fire Dance&quot; shows Turner trying to pull off silly gothic imagery.  The beautiful instrumental &quot;Anybody There&quot; closes side one, possibly even eclipsing the heights acheived on the superb &quot;Weiss Heim&quot; on Finyl Vinyl.  <BR>    The only tracks worth a mention on side two would be the minor radio hit &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; featuring a classic Blackmore solo at the lead break and the Blackmore/Howard Blake penned instrumental &quot;Snowman.&quot;  The rest being rather unremarkable hard rock (Drinking with the Devil) or deflatedattempts at Journey (Desperate Heart).  <BR>    Many blame Turner for the lose of direction Rainbow fell into during the early '80s.  This is not entirely accurate, as Ritchie simply found a vocalist to suit his new vision for the band.  Admittedly, Turner did cough up some fairly mundane lyrics and some over-extensions in the vocal department.  I believe Ritchie was well aware that this formula was over baked, hence realizing that it was time for a change which materialized in the reformation of Purple.
6303407188|5.0|Ed Wood is quite simply Tim Burton's best film. It's a loving portrayal of the man who wanted more than anything to make it in Hollywood. Wood became only the second person to write, direct, produce, and act in his films, blissfully unaware of how inept he was in all four areas. Johnny Depp (is there anything he can't do?) plays Wood to the hilt. I dare you not to laugh when he tries to shake his head yes and no at the same time. Jeffery Jones is also great as Criswell, and is clearly having a lot of fun in the introduction. Bill Murray doesn't really look or sound like John &quot;Bunny&quot; Breckinridge, but I actually think he was much better for the role of the Ruler in Plan 9. However, the single greatest performance is by Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. I had to watch the film twice before it sunk in that he was not the same guy! Overall, just a great film. It knows when to go for laughs and when to go for tears, and it's certainly better than anything Wood himself could have done.

B00005OM4N|5.0|Being a fan of Britney, I probably would've given this CD a good review anyway, but this is her best album to date. But don't take only my word for it, everyone I know likes it(and they aren't even Britney fans). No song sounds like another one, and it shows a more mature Britney. Unlike many pop 'divas' today, she never feels the need to make every word an octave tour de force. She's not Celine, and she doesn't try to be. From the infectious &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; to the rockin' remake of Joan Jett's classic &quot;I Love Rock n' Roll,&quot; Brintey once again proves herself worthy of Madonna's crown.
B000002GDJ|5.0|This is The Police at their best.  Beautifully written songs, oustanding musicianship, wonderful interplay between Sting, Copeland and Summers, and great production (warm, clean and spare).  Here they are before Sting's ego got the better of him, when they were tight and all enjoying themselves.  Stuart Copeland really shines here--listen to the title track, \\"It's All Right\\" and \\"No Time This Time;\\" he's easily as talented and fun to listen to as John Bonham (Led Zeppelin) or Keith Moon (The Who) or Ginger Baker (Cream), though he's more understated than any of them.  This one's a keeper.
6301095294|1.0|To me the Beatles are the greatest group of all time.  Nobody will ever surpass the Beatles, their music lives on.  However, Magical Mystery Tour was something I can't imagine why they did it.  I know the Beatles wanted control of their artistic ability especially after Brain Epstein's death.  In Hard Day's Night, the Beatles were fun and amusing, in this film they were wierd.  I know Beatle humor has always been off beat, but they were really off beat this time.  The scene where the Aunt being scowled by her boyfriend in a stoned looking atmosphere was a nightmare.  This was the Beatles' farse.  The music was great, as all Beatle music was great, but the Beatles' really had no business making this film.  They are too great to have done this.

B00000IBRX|5.0|One of the best movies ever. The eye candy provided in the technique of oil-painting on film screen (newly developed for this movie) makes the film worth seeing by itself- it's one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen in my life (on- or off-screen). The metaphysics is unfortunately all over the map and very off-target, but I don't recommend going to the movies for good theology. The movie does have some very inspiring messages about the need for hope; without which we die. I appreciated the perspective that hell is where people go when they no longer have hope- it made the best sense I had ever seen of the idea that suicides would go to hell. The basis of depression is a lack of hope, and lack of hope at it's basis is sin- in the sense of the original Hebrew, meaning &quot;to miss the mark&quot;. God's best for us was to have hope- to trust, and to have, as the Greek defines the word, &quot;expectant Joy&quot;. As expressed in What Dreams, suicide is the ultimate expression of a lack of hope- in essence one is choosing to not trust God, and choosing to not be in the place of hope, but the place of despair. If we are designed for hope, and choose to deny that, we have denied the basis of all reality. Annie chooses depression, and so her world becomes what she desires, and what she can handle- a world without hope. hell. Because of it's treatment of hope and despair, I would recommend that if you are feeling depressed, see this movie. It won't solve your problems, but it can begin to help you resolve them.
6303921248|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride &amp; Prejudice has been adapted for the big and small screen 3 times and the A&amp;E version is by far the best of the bunch.  What makes it so good?  For one it was filmed as a miniseries, so it is 6 hours long where the other two range between 2 - 3 hours.  The longer film allowed the director to follow the book a lot more closely than the previous two attempts had managed.  The story, as adapted by Andrew Davies (Bridget Jones' Diary, screenplay) was very Austenesque and not hollywoodized in a any way.  <br />     Secondly the cast was superb.  Colin Firth as Fitzwilliam Darcy was an inspired bit of casting.  He didn't just play the part, he was Mr. Darcy.  Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth was also fantatstic.  She had just the right touch of innocence mixed with playfulness.  The chemistry between Ehle and Firth reminded me of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind.<BR>  <BR>     And last but not least was the sets and cosumes.  You truly believe that they are in the 18th century.  One of my favourite scenes is the ball at Netherfield which shows off the costumes to perfection.<BR>     I highly recommend this movie. It is one of my favourites and you don't have to be an Austen fan to enjoy the fine writing and acting to be found here.
6303823351|3.0|The Beatles were always fun to watch on TV and in A Hard Days Night.  But, HELP was really not mean't for the Beatles.  They were too sophisticated for this.  They were really not a bubble gum group.  The Beatles are always fun to watch and the songs were  always great.  But, Brian Epstein should had another film made for them.  It should stayed Eight Arms to Hold You and have been an extension of Hard Days Night showing the Beatles in real life film footage, traveling, talking, and best of all have them at real live concerts with surround stereo sound. They were playing in stadiums at that time, they should have put the Shea stadium concert on it. Anyway, I know John hated making HELP and I don't blame him.  He was an artist, not teeny bopper sex symbol.  This film must have degraded him. I believe this was what made him hate being a Beatle and made him break away years later.  Epstein should have used his head on this one.  HELP was an enormous success, but it did more harm to the Beatles than good.

6303431038|5.0|Wyatt Earp is a masterpiece!!! The theatrical version is great, but the Special Expanded Edition is much better. I wish that they would have shown the whole movie as it appears in the Expanded Edition in the theatres. This version has 20 more minutes of additional footage that is not shown in the original version. There is an expanded wagon train scene, an expanded wedding scene, and many totally new scenes such as Wyatt's confrontation with the cousin of the cowboy he killed in Dodge city. There is also much added footage of the aftermath of the O.K. Corral gunfight, such as the scene where Wyatt and Doc are in jail together awaiting trial for their actions in the gunfight, etc. Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid are awesome as Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday! This movie is a masterpiece!!!
6303471714|5.0|I use this video every other month when I need to lose some extra pounds and really tighten things up.  The movements and repetition effectively focus on all the right places and deliver results in no time.  <BR>It is true that Cindy is not always in the correct position, so I highly recommend this to anyone who already knows the correct form to use for different positions and movements.  For others, get some good instruction first, you should anyway.  But also listen closely to Radu in the background, because he does correct her.  Other workout videos simply have too much instruction and move slowly.  You do not have to keep up with Cindy's pace to see results.  Make each set as strong as you can.  Its pace and great results keep this workout video top on my list.

B00005QHPQ|5.0|I like all the work Enrique has done so far. I think most people don't realize who his audience is, they're young teenage girls. I know everyone has their own opinion about the album but you should hear it before you make tasteless comments. Enrique could do no wrong by me...I've been a fan since 96. This album is more upbeat and gives you something to dance to. It's a remarkable change; hopefully his next album will be as good or better than his previous.

B000002KIT|5.0|Ah the memories come flooding back. As a teenager back in the seventies I was lucky enough to see Thin Lizzy on the breakthrough &quot;Jailbreak&quot; tour, and then again on the &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; tour, which makes up part of this incredible live set.<br />From the opening chord of &quot;Jailbreak&quot;, through to the final chord of &quot;The Rocker&quot; this is perhaps one of the most awesome and unforgettable live albums of all time. Lizzy became great on two things, hard work and the late Philip Lynott's majestic songwriting. Powered by the twin-guitar attack of Brian Robertson and Scott Gorham, &quot;Live And Dangerous&quot; is a classic example of a band at the height of their powers.<br />Sad to think, then, that this was also the end of an era. By the time the next album was released, Robertson had gone, to be replaced by Gary Moore at what turned out to be the start of a very turbulent period in the career of the bad.<br />But what a way to end an era. From &quot;Fighting&quot; to &quot;Bad Reputation&quot;, this was Thin Lizzy at their best, and this set could quite easily have been called &quot;The Bext Of Thin Lizzy - Live&quot;. The majesty of &quot;Emerald&quot;, the sheer power of &quot;Massacre&quot;, the almost touching sentiment of &quot;Still In love With You&quot; (coupled with the devastatingly emotional solo from Robertson) to the sheer exuberance of &quot;Sha-La-La&quot; and &quot;Baby Drives Me Crazy&quot;, this covers all the bases.<br />However, at a time when many bands are having their back catalogs remastered, enhanced and re-released, it is maybe fitting that this treatment should also be applied to Thin Lizzy. If the &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; tour was recorded, why not include &quot;Soldier Of Fortune&quot; (the opener on the British tour), or &quot;Bad Reputation&quot; itself (including Brian Downey's drum solo), and where oh where is that incredible live version of &quot;Me And The Boys Are Wondering How You And The GirlsAre Getting Home From Here Tonight&quot; previously only available on the b-side of the &quot;Rosalie&quot; live single.<br />But these are minor quibbles. This album is simply a must for die-hard Thin Lizzy fans, and newcomers alike. By all means buy the compilations, but this is the one album which would give a true introduction to the work of Thin Lizzy, and is way more representative of the band at their best than the somewhat disappointing &quot;Life&quot; or the more recent tribute album &quot;One Night Only&quot;.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney did it again, this cd is great....Even the remake of Joan Jett's I love Rock and Roll is tremendously done.   Her voice has never sounded better. if you want some great music, don't hesitate at all to buy this gem!
0451528018|4.0|The story was a little uneasy at first, but the action and plot and all that good stuff kicks in.

0790734850|5.0|A must-see for any person that claims to be a film fan. Set in Los Angeles in the early 1950's, L.A. Confidential is a violent but gripping thriller which examines the dark underbelly and corruption of the city of LA, at a time when it still held a beautiful movie star image. Principally, this is the story of 3 very different cops, Bud White (Russell Crowe), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), who have totally different ways of getting the job done. Each with their own agenda, each with their own character and each corrupt to a differing degree, their paths cross in this intricate but brilliantly plotted movie as they seek to find &quot;the coffee shop killers&quot; and solve the mystery of high class prostitutes &quot;cut&quot; to look like movie stars. Brilliantly directed by Curtis Hanson and based on a James Ellroy novel, LA Confidential also boasts an outstanding supporting cast including, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny Devito and the Oscar winning Kim Basinger. The best film of 1998 and perhaps even the best film of the nineties, LA Confidential should have walked off with a barrowload of Oscars. Better than a thousand Titanic's (if you disagree you're wrong) , LA Confidential never fails to hit it's mark and is simply unmissable.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is definitely the most original movie in a long time.  It takes all the elements of a suspense/thriller and twist them around in such a way that it will be like nothing you have ever seen.  It includes good acting and a great plot. Guy Pearce portrayed his character flawlessly and made it completely believable. Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano also turned in wonderful performances.  The plot was good and played out beautifully. It could have worked through the conventional way movies are shown (forward) but the unusual twist made it all that more interesting. People who don't understand the plot or think it is hard to follow simply didn't pay attention, or dont understand that you weren't intended to understand it until the end. Or they jusy weren't smart enough to figure it out. This movie is one of the best thrillers and rates way up there with the likes of Fight Club and The Matrix. Go see it.

B00005JKHP|4.0|After approximately six long months of waiting for Star Trek: The Motion Picture to be released on DVD, it's finally here. And I'm one happy bunny. . .OK, a reasonably happy bunny. For after all the pre-release hype about what was and wasn't going to be done to the original print in way of a overhaul, everything that's been done is so, so good, you can't help but notice that you can't notice the difference.<BR>The new opening title sequence is a joy, although I'd have liked to see a beefed up version of the TNG theme, as opposed to the one that was actually there. Damn fine musical intro though when U plug the audio through your Hi-Fi.<BR>The opening sequence with the Klingon Warbirds still looks lousy, despite all the cleaning up of the visual effects that have obviously taken place for the new edition. That said, it's still a big improvement on the original version of the scene.<BR>The film's new visual effects are superb. The new CGI rendering of the Enterpise is so seamless U almost can't see it. <BR>The deleting and tweaking of scenes has made TMP a new movie. I will say that the first 30 mins still drags as it did in the original. But when the Enterprise get's going, the action moves suprisingly fast for what was always a very slow film.<BR>The dialogue and action is so much tighter than previosly, making for a much more pleasurable viewing experience. I never once thought, &quot;how long left to go&quot;, something rare for a film of 2hrs 15 mins.<BR>The second disc delivers a coup de grace with it's superb documentaries, in-depth cast and crew interviews and deleted scenes. It's almost a complete library on the making of the movie. Terrific stuff.<BR>I have two gripes. The film hasn't been re-mastered. Certain areas of the print are showing quite a bit of wear and would've benefited from a clean up. Also, the menu screens on the first disc are terrible.<BR>But not to worry. This is Paramount. We've got more from them than we've ever got before.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Glad to see they haven't forgotten the man who started it all, Syd Barret.<BR>You get 36, what must have been hard to decide songs plus all the lyrics to accompany them!<BR>Serious Floyd heads will note the clever editing of some of the 70's era  &quot;long&quot; songs. <BR>Sacrilage? At least their on the cd.<br />I'm not too sure on the way they have joined these songs. In terms of tempo and mood I don't know if they gave this much thought.<br />A best of album will always produce a debate amongst the bands fans. This however is 95% agreeable in my eyes. Sad to see no songs off Obscured by Clouds on here. Gilmour's Childhoods End is always welcome song with me.<br />If your looking for a classic Floyd compilation that can join you on those long car journeys then this is it!!<br />Well done Floyd. <BR>Hope to see them in a stadium again soon!
B00005QDW5|3.0|The main sales argument of this compilation are the so-called «transitions» between the songs that are supposed to make it flowing. Well, it's not quite true. Here's a review of all the transitions.<br />Disc 1<br />1-2: No transition.<BR>2-3: Simple Fade-out-in.<BR>3-4: The classic transisition from the Wall.<BR>4-5: No Transition, and Echoes is 5 minutes shorter.<BR>5-6: Light Fade-out-in, almost unperceptible.<BR>6-7: Slight fade-out-in.<BR>7-8: I guess the pianos are supposed to coincide, but it doesn't feel right.<BR>8-9: No transitions, and the long silence is kind of embarassing.<BR>9-10: Fade-out-in, like the Great gig- Money on DSOTM.<BR>10-11: Great, the first disc is almost over and we get the first real transition with the last note of Money coinciding with the first of Keep Talking.<BR>11-12: Birds and sheep sounds. <BR>12-13: Another good one, but two transitions on disc one, it's a big let down.<br />Disc 2<br />1-2: Extended version of SOYCD, nice fade-in-out.<BR>2-3: Good fade-out-in. Time begins and ends with whispering winds.<BR>3-4: Great fade-out-in, with the ending of «Is there anybody out there?» as a bridge between the 2 songs. <BR>4-5: Another windy transition. It's becoming annoying.<BR>5-6: Another damn wind transition.<BR>6-7: Guest what... WIND !!!<BR>7-8: GREAT ONE !!! The last word of Us and Them echoes until it turns into the first note of Learning to Fly.<BR>8-9: No transition.<BR>9-10: Weak fade-in-out. They should have ended Arnold with the old radio sound of WYWH...<BR>10-11: Arghhhh, wind...<BR>11-12: Average fade-out-in.<BR>12-13: Funny !!! The nostalgic church bells of High Hopes turns into a small bike ringer for Bike. <br />So, the transitions, for the most part, are nothing to get exited about. And it's not flowing. If, like me, you are tired of carrying your entire Pink Floyd discography in your car, this is a great collection of the best Pink Floyd songs (and not only the hits), but don't expect more.
6303461484|5.0|In the Old Russia, bringing criminal charges against a member of the Communist Party were at best, difficult, and once you see this movie, you will understand just how difficult it really was. This is a true story about a serial killer in the former Soviet Union. Now, what made it even tougher on the investigator of this case was not just the fact that the person was a member of the Communist Party, but, also the Soviet's pride was a key issue in that they did not want to admit to the world that a Serial Killer might lurk in their country.<BR>Stephen Rea plays Burakov, a man who is to be the detective in finding Citizen X, a violent serial killer who preys mostly on children. It's his dauntless task to seek out Citizen X with very few resources. Eventually, he has more aides to help him with this task, including a Russian Colonel played by Donald Sutherland.<BR>In real life, 52 people were murdered in an 8 year span that ended in 1990. The murders were violent and gruesome. The movie coincides with this harsh reality in scenes that those with weak stomachs will have a hard time viewing. It's a film that is acted superbly and with Excellent writing and directing. It's an inspiring movie in that it shows determination on the part of the detective and his aides that eventually got them the person they had been looking for. There is no doubt that this is a 5 star movie.
0060975768|5.0|This is the best rendition of tactics in Vietnam and a must read for small unit leaders.  We Were Soldiers Once...And Young takes us on a journey with then Lieutenant Colonel &quot;Hal&quot; Moore and Joe Galloway, the reporter who climbed on a helicopter heading for a &quot;hot&quot; landing zone, into the Ia Drang Valley.  The North Vietnamese baited the 7th Cav into a firefight in order to determine how the U.S. would fight, and they learned quickly in the first major engagement of the war.  As the battalion commander of the 1/7 Cav, LTC Moore engages in a battle for the lives of everyone in his unit.  The lessons which Mr. Galloway and LTG (Retired) Moore illustrate in the first section of the book will drive home the need for discipline and leadership during combat.  The first section makes the book worth the read, all by itself.<br />  Fortunately, there are two other sections, equally as dramatic.  The second section lets us walk with the 2nd battalion, 7th Cavalry Division into an ambush quickly established by the NVA.  This time almost the entire unit is wiped out.  Due to poor discipline (not putting out security, letting soldiers smoke and talk on break, etc..) the 2/7 is completely surprised.  This book uniquely juxtaposes the difference in success between two similar units, with very different leadership, morale, and discipline.  The lessons are stark and vivid.<br />  The third section, titled Aftermath, describes life on the homefront - not the protests and demonstrations, but the military families waiting to hear how their soldiers are doing.  The description of Western Union hiring taxi drivers to deliver death notices is emotional.  Some wives were awakened at 4:00am in the morning and handed a yellow slip with the words, &quot;The Secretary of the Army regrets to inform you that your husband .... was killed in action, etc..&quot;  If you don't want to go to bed crying, don't read this powerful account of how coldly the institution cared for families during the Vietnam era.  My wife and I have both spent over ten years of service in the Army and found this section to be a powerful motivation for helping to care for military families.<br />  As the title of this review indicates, the movie is coming soon.  Mel Gibson will play Joe Galloway, and other famous actors will take part.  I highly recommend this account of courage, leadership, discipline, success and failure.  This book spent several weeks on the New York Times best seller list, and almost every senior leader in the Army recommends it as mandatory reading for leaders at the tactical level.  You won't be disappointed!
B00005QDW5|4.0|A cracking album overall! <BR>Glad to see the inclusion of lyrics on all of the songs. Nice touch.<BR>Also nice to see they haven't forgotten the man who started it all, Syd Barret. Several of his master pieces have been included!<br />One short fall is the way they have edited some of their longer tracks in order to &quot;make them fit&quot;. A classic example being Echoes.<BR>Several bars of music have been cleverly mixed out to form a shorter version. It doesn't spoil the song but if your a keen Floyd fan you will notice it.<br />They must have scratched their heads on what to put down and what not to. Also the departure Of Mr Waters could not have helped here. <BR>Like the title says. Their best may not be your best.<BR>I would have dropped several songs in order to put some from Obscured by Clouds (that album doesn't get a sniff here).<BR>A classic song like Childhoods End would have been most welcome.<br />Overall if your looking for a well made Floyd compliation that will save you changing CDs every five minutes whilst in the car / bath.<BR>This is it!<br />Well done boys. Hope to see you in a stadium soon!
6301763041|4.0|Johnny Depp is smokin' hot in this John Waters film as Crybaby, a motorcycle ridin' bad boy of the greaser-elvis-rockabilly variety who sheds a single tear and makes all the girls swooooon. Crybaby is leader of the &quot;drape&quot; gang, which includes feisty sis Ricki Lake, who's &quot;so happy all knocked-up&quot;. He has his sights set on local &quot;square&quot; Allison, who's tired of being a good girl. Traci Lords is great as a big-busted slutty drape trollop with an attitude. Iggy Pop (bow down to the father of punk) plays crybaby's redneck uncle, who's MIGHTY close with Grandma, if you catch my drift. hee-hee!<br />Oh, and don't miss seeing Hatchetface (gee, why do they call her that?...)<br />please note: for repeated viewings, i recommend having the remote handy, thumb poised over the mute button. You can only suffer through the likes of &quot;king crybaby&quot; and &quot;tear drops are falling&quot; so many times.<br />ENJOY!
B00005JKHP|5.0|I went out today and bought a DVD player for the sole purpose of being able to view Star Trek- The Motion Picture, The Directors Edition. I must say, it was a worthwhile investment.<br />The re-working of the film is beautiful and subtle. New special effects have been added that almost seamlessly match the appearance of the original work. A shot of the Vulcan Kolinahr temple retooled through CGI a-la George Lucas is awesome. There are some beautiful additional shots of the Enterprise throughout the film, all brief but each adds to the scope and visual enjoyment of the overall film. The sequences leading up to the landing party discovering V'Ger have been almost completely redone. It's all very nice!<br />The sound on the picture has been improved. The bridge of the Enterprise is alive with background chatter and the traditional computers humming, making the film mush less quiet. Some scenes have been trimmed back to allow for pacing and to make Kirk seem a little less stressed out. Other scenes have been restored. Even the overture and opening credits have been &quot;jazzed up&quot;. Overall, it comes down to a bunch of tiny subtle changes adding up to make a huge positive overall differance. The film is absolutely beautiful.<br />The second disk is filled with a priceless wealth of extras, including live-action screen tests from &quot;Star Trek Phase 2&quot; the series that never was. Also, it was very nostalgic to see the different TV spots and trailers from way back then. <br />THIS IS WHAT PARAMOUNT NEEDS TO DO WITH EACH OF THE STAR TREK FILMS. The other films on DVD are awful by comparison. Fans would eat this kind of thing up. Paramount must realize that. I hope that more Directors Series Trek films are on the way soon.
B000002KIK|4.0|I have read many reviews which regard this Sabbath album as a downer, and can't understand why. True, it marked the end of an era for Ozzy, but it holds up after all these years as a fitting closer. I heard this album back in 1978 while in Junior High, then did not hear it again until I bought the CD in 1993. I wondered if I would like it after forgetting so many songs from it. It turns out, I liked it even better as I got older and my tastes grew. The band transcended the typical cliches of 70's heavy rock, adding textures and chord changes that were inventive. It never mattered how heavy Sabbath got, they always stayed rooted in melody - perhaps Ozzy's singing style can account for this. The riffs were always balanced against a strong melody. I loved the synth and piano textures in here, as well as the slightly jazzy guitar approach on &quot;Air Dance&quot;. The title track is heavy and dark but at the same time, almost cheery in a major-chord way. The same can be said for &quot;It's a Hard Road&quot;. The only clunker to my ears is the closing track, &quot;Swinging the Chain&quot;. The vocals are not up to Ozzy's standards ( the track is not sung by him), and musically it is weak. All in all, a strong and varied album that shows a band not treading water at the end of an era.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Overall, I was pleasntly surprised by this album. I admit that I'm a Britney fan 110% of the way, but I hadn't seen to many people that actually liked &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; which didn't make me feel that this album would be too big. Now, &quot;Britney&quot; does show a growth spurt in Ms. Spears, maybe not a big one though. Her sound hasn't really matured except for on a few occasional songs. She still sings her heart out on the topic of love, but like &quot;Oops!' is beginning to demand more respect then what we saw on &quot;Baby...&quot;.  She's becoming a woman, admist catchy tunes and sometimes childish lyrics. I HIGHLY suggest that everyone goes and purchases this album now because you WON'T be dissapointed at all. Here's a song-by-song review:<br />1.I'm A Slave 4 U-This is a completely new sound for Britney, and I feel that it's one of her best songs so far. I feel the need to get up and dance every time I hear this song. The chorus flows SOOOOOO well that it's scary, but this song lacks an actual formula, and if anything that just makes it even better. Plus, the dance break in the middle is so tight. 5/5<br />2.Overprotected-Actually, this is a surprisingly good song. At times you get an electronica feel, and the &quot;I need love, time, space&quot; part of the song sounds great. The breakdown where she semi-raps is a fine addition to this already perfect song. 5/5<br />3.Lonely-Without a doubt, this is the best song on the album. The chorus is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO unbelievably addictive that it's not even funny. I kinda get a feel of &quot;What U See (What U Get)&quot; from &quot;Oops!&quot; when I listen to this song in the sense that it's such a powerful song, probably the most powerful song on this entire album. I'm not even doing justice to this song...you need to listen to this song and you WILL agree. Shoot, I've already listened to this song about 50 times. 5/5 (it's worth more though)<br />4. I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman-The only ballad onthe entire album. Truthfully, it's a good song, but like her ballads from the other previous albums it's nothing too powerful. This sounds alot like &quot;From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart&quot; since her ballads don't seem to mature with her. It sucks that she doesn't have a powerhouse voice, but this song is still beautiful and will touch you. 3/5<br />5.Boys-Sounds alot like &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; at times. She speaks the verses, which gets kinda annoying. The background vocals on the entire song are unique but occasionally don't blend well with Britney's voice. It's a bit of a sexually-suggestive song at times, but the chorus is pretty cathy though. 4/5<br />6.Anticpating-This song kinda gives the impression of the earlier Michael Jackson songs. Basically, she sings about going to the club dancing, and I really enjoy this song. This reminds me of a few songs off &quot;Baby...&quot; but to a new level. She's done well with this song...I'm very pleased. 5/5<br />7.I Love Rock 'N' Roll-Britney covers a song on every album, and decided on the Joan Jett classic this time. Truthfully, it's not as good as &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot;, but she gets credit because this is a complete rock song, and doesn't show one bit of pop. Not the best song on the album, but fairly good. 4/5<br />8.Cinderella-The lyrics get cheesy at times, and the chorus is pretty good...the verses get your attention though. It's an OK song, and I still like it. Not one of Britney's best, but it's still one that you want to put on repeat in your stereo. 4/5<br />9.Let Me Be-I don't really know how to describe this song. I like it, and it's pretty original for Ms. Spears. I get a latin feel at times, but it adds to this already amazing song. 5/5<br />10.Bombastic Love-Like &quot;Let Me Be&quot; this is a pretty original song for Britney. Lyrics are cheesy here also occasionally, but it's OK. Not a bad song, but not her best either. There's an opera solo in the middle of the song, which sounds alot like &quot;Most Girls&quot; by Pink. But the opera section is th ebest part of the song...something new for her that I like. 4/5<br />11.That's Where You Take Me-Like &quot;Anticipating&quot; this is song gives you a childish feeling...I like the sound though which she pulls off very well. Well done, Britney. 5/5<br />12.What It's Like To Be Me-This is a standout song, and one of the best on the album. Justin, her boyfriend, wrote it and he provides the background vocals for her. I think this is the second best song on the album. The beat is AMAZING, and Britney's and Justin's voices blend well together. Like &quot;Lonely&quot; I can't even do this song justice. Justin b-boxes twice during the song, and actually the second time he does is at the end of the song, and it sounds brilliant. I get a kind of hip-hop feel from this song, and it's just TERRIFIC!! 5/5 (once again, it's worth more than that)<br />OVERALL GRADE:4.5/5
B00005OM4N|5.0|All the songs in the album are great!!!!!<BR>It's worth to spend money on!<BR>Belive me.

1577311523|5.0|An abolutely fantastic read. Brings back to light the simplicity of life and how we as humans have done nothing but complicated the very being of life!<BR>A must read ....if u are one of those who needs the answers
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I loved this movie.  It's got a great plot and is very creative with analogies to other movies and fairy tales.  But, you can read professional reviews to discover all that.  The extras on the disk are fantastic -- &quot;interviews&quot; with the stars, information about how it was made and so on.<br />One warning:  There's a lot of, er, bathroom humor in the movie, especially related to, er, flatulence.  It's over the head of a 3-4 year old, but I'm not sure I'd want an 8-year-old watching it.
B00005R62N|5.0|This band is cheesy and dumm, the singer is horrid.  Listen to Korn and Linkin Park to here what good singing is.  Go Bengals!!  The best football team ever, they will be the 2001 football champions!!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Apple's 1996 release Tidal offered some interesting alternative music and smokey alto vocal turns, but the record was uneven and had only one real &quot;hit&quot; song, Criminal. What's criminal, however, is how her far superior follow-up, When the Pawn... was mostly ignored by radio. Songs Limp, Fast As You Can, and Paper Bag showcase a mature singer/songwriter who knows how to create a hook both musically and metaphorically.<br />Highlights of the album include the lyrics of Paper Bag, where Apple laments: &quot;I've got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold; hunger hurts but starving works when it comes to love.&quot;<br />Such lyrical wizardly repeats throughout the consistent album, which ends with the heartbreaking &quot;I know.&quot; When the Pawn... may not feature Fiona Apple acting sexy and nymph-like like in her video for Criminal, but it does feature a vastly improved artist.
0385505833|5.0|I checked this book out from the library, read it in one sitting and the book didn't dissapoint. It was so funny, I loved it, I will probably buy it, because its such a great novel.  This  holiday novel ought to be read by everyone this year. Another great novel, from John Grisham.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I wouldn't call myself a Die-Hard Star Wars fan, however I do enjoy the Star Wars movies.  Episode 1 was to me an entertaining and well-placed addition to the Star Wars saga. I'm sure we all know the plot by now, so I will get right to my thoughts on the film.  I thought the way the movie gave clues to Anakin's future was well done. Darth Maul was by far in my opinion the best part of this film. Where have you see Episode 1 merchandice without his menacing face plastered on it? The effects were specatuclar as usual.  The fight scenes were very complex and well done. My only complaint is the too much may happen in the last 1/4 of the movie.  It's a bit overwhelming. Death of a hero, the planet of Naboo is reclaimed,a huge battle, and the death of Darth Maul.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Gone in 60 seconds is a adrenaline rush that grabs you from the very beginning and never lets go.  But few people know that its a remake of a 1974 Classic where nearly 100 cars are destroyed in the 40 minute chase scene between a 1973 Mustang Mach 1 and the entire city of long beach.  But we arent talking about that now are we?<br />Bottom line:  this is the coolest car movie out there right now, the fast and the furious comes close, but not quite.  The assignment is to steal 50 Exotic beauties in 72 hours or Cage's brother gets the axe.  Cool huh?  With cars ranging from a 1967 Corvette to a Lamborghini Diablo.  And the final car, which is none other than a 1967 Shelby Mustang GT500.  The sexiest car in existance.<br />This is a guy movie, no doubt about it.  But it, watch it. Then dream of Porsches and Shelbys...
6304765789|5.0|What kind of birthday gift do you get for a guy who has everything? How about something he cannot buy?  Like a renewed appreciation for things he has. Not just material things, but his personal relationships--and even his life itself.  <BR>Michael Douglas stars as Nicholas Van Orton, a divorced wealthy businessman who has acquired all the material wealth one could ever want, but something is lacking. <BR>Enter The Game. <BR>It is Nicholas's 48th birthday and his rebellious brother, played by Sean Penn, gives as a gift an invitation to play The Game.<BR>Nicholas is not informed of the rules of said game or even when it will start.  He is told that it is sort of like a vacation only you don't go to it--it comes to you. <BR>He is thrown into a series of events which at the beginning he is slightly amused. But the stakes increase and when his world is so unpredictable and turned upside down and he thinks he's lost everything, he is convinced that this is no longer a game. It becomes a struggle for his very life. <BR>The ending is emotionally moving and it makes the viewer think about what is really important in life.  <BR>Buy it. Rent it. See it at a friends house--whatever. But see this movie!
B00005JKHP|5.0|It's amazing.  Robert Wise and company have removed everything bad about this film.  The pacing is better and stronger.  The new visual effects are amazing and the old ones have been tidied.  The best change, in my opinion, was removing that honk-honk-honk &quot;red alert&quot; effect and that terrible computer voice -- the film's now less cluttered and flows much, much better.  There are a couple of nits to pick -- for example, in the new external shots, the ship's running lights don't flash -- but that's just to please the hardcore Trekkie nitpickers.   Just an incredible rework of a bad film into a near-classic.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is an endearing and wonderful film that maximizes a great cast and an excellent screenplay.  I can hardly believe the negative reviews this film elicited in its cinema run.  The plot is very fluid and continuous.  There is an occasional weak moment (i.e., Reese Witherspoon dressed as a pink Playboy Bunny for an alleged costume party.)  But who cares?  Even the weak moments are fun!<BR>  <BR>   Witherspoon's heroine, Elle Woods, is a warm and extroverted young woman madly in love with a pompous Harvard law student who breaks up with her because she is not conservative and serious enough to fulfil his political aspirations.  Loyal Elle enrolls at Harvard (despite her glamorous fashion interests, she is quite intelligent) determined to prove she can cut it in Pompous Boyfriend's world. Despite several challenges (cutthroat instructors, hostile professional students who don't take her seriously) Elle does not give up her candor, courtesy, or optimism.  She moves on to prove her worth through actions, sometimes intuitive and impulsive, but on the mark nonetheless. <br />  I think the underlying message in this film is not to discriminate against people because they are &quot;different&quot; than what you stereotype people to be.  Why couldn't a savvy party girl also be a successful attorney?  This is the sort of prejudice women in our country have been fighting for years.<br />  With wit, class, and charm &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; provides all that it promises: eye candy, comedy, and romantic fun. Classic entertainment!!!A definite keeper!!!
B000002KB8|5.0|Ignoring the lyrics, this is still one of my favourite albums. Definitely to played with the volume cranked up. As a blues/rock fan, this has all the elements I like. In particular, the unusual rhythms generated by Bill Ward on drums, great guitar from Tony Iommi, long tracks and great atmosphere. Ground breaking album that still holds up. Even my 17yr old son latched onto this one. The only down side is the dark side of the lyrics.
B00003CXA4|3.0|Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is a loving look at the life of one the biggest figures of the 20th century.  Tracing his life from a young man to his final days as the spiritual leader of India, Mr. Attenborough leaves no stone unturned.  That's the film's biggest problem, it is long and exhaustive and drags in one too many places.  Ben Kingsley is brilliant in the lead role.  His transformation from a strong-headed young lawyer to the understanding leader of non-violent resistance is remarkable.  Mr. Kingsley won a well-deserved Oscar (though Paul Newman was equally deserving for his role in The Verdict that year) for the role.  The film is also quite beautiful to look at as Mr. Attenborough captures the mysticism of India.  If one can fight through the over three hours of film, you will have seen a great performance and beautiful vistas.  The film predictably swept through the 1982 Oscars (the academy loves factual epics), winning Best Picture, Best Director, as mentioned Best Actor and five other awards.
B000002L73|5.0|If you would ask me to pick the worst Ramones albums, the choice would be easy : 'End of the Century', 'Subterranean Jungle' and 'Pleasant Dreams'. Not that any of these albums are bad, but they don't cut it as much as all their other CDs. 'Too Tough To Die' has everything you expect from a Ramones album and more. The production is outstanding and the Ramones never sounded better than this. Songs like 'Too Tough To Die', 'Daytime Dilemma', 'Endless Vacation' or even 'Wart Hog' kick you in the guts and make you come back for more. Joey's contributions like 'No Go', 'Howling at the Moon' or 'Chasing the Night' are fantastic rock songs and prove, that he was just as much a 'Rock'n'Roller' than a 'Punk Rocker'. This album will make you go back to Amazon.com and order the remaining Ramones albums !
B000002KDX|4.0|America's self-titled debut album is a fine collection of folk-rock songs.  The album was spurred on by the success of the number one hit &quot;A Horse With No Name&quot;, which is a 70's AM gold classic. The album has other solid efforts including the trippy &quot;Sandman&quot; and the gorgeous ballad &quot;I Need You&quot; which was another top ten hit, peaking at number nine.  &quot;Donkey Jaw&quot; has some great acoustic guitar work and &quot;Rainy Day&quot; is another pretty song.  The album also reached number one on the charts.
B000025XDU|5.0|If you grew up in the USA, you probably did not hear too much of Status Quo after their early hit in the sixties 'Pictures of Matchstick Men'. Generally, you can group their albums into three stages : Their 'Early years' which ended with their 'Dog of two heads' album - their 'Great year' which started with 'Piledriver' and ended with 'Back to Back' and then there are the 'It's all downhill from here' years which started with the 'In the Army Now' album and just won't end ! If you only want three Status Quo albums, buy their 1976 'Live' double CD, the 1979 'Whatever you Want' album (if you are lucky, you might find the 'Whatever you Want / Just Supposin' ' CD which unfortunately does not include the fantastic 'High Flyer' that was released on vinyl only) and buy this album - 1973's 'Hello !'. During this time period, Quo were on top of the world, or at least on top of Europe. They finally found their niche with 'Piledriver' and with this album they mastered their science. 'Roll over lay down' gets things started and is followed by `Claudie', which is one of Francis Rossi's finest moments. 'Reason for Living' is a hopping little Quo piece and 'Blue Eyed Lady' must be the most underrated Quo track ever. It shows, that these guys could really play ! Side two of the original vinyl album starts with THE Quo classic: 'Caroline'. 'Softer Ride' keeps on rocking' and the most quiet part of this album is 'And it's better now'. And then comes the 9 minute boogie explosion of 'Forty-Five Hundred Times' - I guarantee, these are some of the best 9 minutes you have heard from any rock group. If you still have some money left after buying the three albums mentioned above, get the 1974 release 'Quo' which is their hardest album ever (thanks to the major contribution of founding member and bass player Alan Lancaster) - but 'Hello' presents Status Quo at their best !
0393312836|5.0|I have read this book several times, and read many of the reviews posted here. Many wrote that Burgess' invented slang was difficult at first, or slowed the book down. I couldn't disagree more. <BR>Burgess' ear for patterns of speech, colloquialism and his seemingly instinctive choices for slang are uncanny, if not absolutely brilliant. How many writers can invent a language? And do it in such a readable way, that meshes perfectly with the timeframe and intention of the story?<BR>Add to this that he has created empathetic characters, a perfect linear narrative, and an incredible social commentary that has every bit of relevance now as it did when it was written. What is the result?<BR>...A truly great work, which will be read and will provoke thought long after this reviewer and the likes of amazon.com have perished. <BR>Sorry to be so dramatic, but few books fly at this lofty altitude of excellence.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Ok now this album wasnt the worst ive heard so i gave it 2 stars cause it was close. Dont get me wrong, i love Britney Spears but this album just didnt do it for her.&quot;Im a slave 4 you&quot; was an ok song but she keeps the same tune basicly and it gets boring. I do like the songs &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; is ok. The one song i think i so unbelievably bad is &quot;Im not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; OMG she sounds sooooo bad in. Her voice was not ment for that song. I really can not stand that song. This is my own opinion so just check out the album BEFORE you buy it.
B00000DCHD|4.0|Without a doubt, \\"The Stranger\\" was a breakthrough album for Billy Joel as it produced several Top-40 singles and, at the same time, it validated his credentials as a pop artist. Having enjoyed considerable success with this album, it would've been easy for Joel to stay the course and follow-up with another album that took the same musical approach. If he did, it would undoubtedly be successful but it would also be formulaic and lackluster too. Fortunately, this didn't happen. <BR> <BR>On \\"52nd Street\\", Joel rises to the occasion by pushing his creative talents to a higher level by blending up-tempo pop with mainstream jazz--with great results no less! Although \\"52nd Street\\" didn't produce as many hit singles as \\"The Stranger\\", it's still a fine album and it's one that every Billy Joel fan will want to own. Here's a summary and an evaluation of each song on the album: <br />Big Shot: An in-your-face rocker that seethes with anger and ridicule. Grade: A+<br />Honesty: While \\"Big Shot\\" is full of scorn, \\"Honesty\\" has an air of incredulity and cynicism to it. Released as a single, \\"Honesty\\" received a lot of airplay on adult contemporary stations and is still a playlist favorite. However, it's not one of my favorites as it's a bit too slow. Grade: C-<br />My Life: A nice up-tempo song that features Chicago's Peter Cetera and Donnie \\"No Talent\\" Dacus on background vocals. This was a Top-10 hit back in 1978 and it still gets a fair amount of airplay even today. A good song but it's beginning to sound a bit jaded. Grade: B<br />Zanzibar: One of my favorites! Nice jazz-pop number that features trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. Grade: A+<br />Stiletto: This is one song that will make you snap your fingers to the beat. Joel's pulsating piano combined with an intense rhythm section gives this song a \\"West Side Story\\" feel to it. Far better than the somewhat sappy \\"She's Always A Woman\\". Grade: B+<br />Rosalinda's Eyes: Another favorite. Nice mix of Latin and jazz styles. Grade: A+<br />Half a Mile Away: Good up-tempo number that tells of Joel's urban world. The brass section is solid and makes this song move. Grade: B<br />Until the Night: This is one of the few songs on this album that I definitely don't like. \\"Until the Night\\" is a rather slow piece that lacks any real melody. It's also rather heavy and a bit pretentious. Grade: F<br />52nd Street: Richie Canatta's clarinet gives this song a New Orleans jazz flavor which is good because this is basically a bland song that doesn't have much to recommend it. Too bad Joel couldn't have ended this album on a better note. Grade: D-
B00005QG9J|5.0|I really don't understand what's wrong with Incubus changing up their style.  They carry enough talent and diversity to do so.  I must admit that &quot;Make Yourself&quot; is my alltime favorite Incubus album, but &quot;Morning View&quot; comes in a close second.  The melodies to the songs are infectious and contagious, the lyric is smart and thought-provoking, and the voice of lead-singer Brandon Boyd is irresistably sexy-- strong in the heavy songs and calm in the lighter songs.  What an amazingly talented band.  Anyone who has an open mind about change and buys this cd shouldn't be disappointed.
B00005NP04|5.0|Now, this is a good CD!  It was enjoyable to listen to, and not one that I'm going to let sit on my CD rack and not think about again.  There are at least 10 good tracks out of 19.  The new songs are fun, emotional, interesting, but definately enjoyable.
B000006TRV|1.0|Let's step back in time some 20 years...I was a Pink Floyd fan at that time. Loved &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, loved &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;. Then comes The Wall, with &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot;. <br />&quot;We don't need no education...&quot; When I first heard that, those many years ago, I was completely enraged. Perhaps the Floyds were protesting the system in place at the time, but I survived it with my faculties intact and then and now enraged at the general level of ignorance in American society. Without education, we'd still be living at the cultural level of gorillas and chimpanzees. <br />Somewhere in the boxes unpacked since several moves ago are those original 33rpm LP records of &quot;Dark Side&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; ,and the cassette tapes I copied from them . They've remained there. The anger I felt when I first heard &quot;Another Brick&quot; has lasted decades. <br />Grrrrr......
B00005QDW5|3.0|If you're new to Floyd, or wish to explore beyond what you hear on the radio all the time, then this is a good place to start. It contains songs from all the major phases of the band, including the Syd Barrett era, the Roger Waters era, and the David Gilmour era. Most of the hits are here, including &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and of course &quot;Another Brick In The Wall (Part II)&quot;.<br />However, as with most &quot;greatest hits&quot; albums, some of their best known works are not represented. &quot;Have A Cigar&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; are all missing, as is the classic &quot;Brain Damage&quot; (&quot;...I'll see you on the dark side of the moon...&quot;). Still, this is a much better compilation than &quot;A Collection of Great Dance Songs&quot; (which lacked any Syd Barrett material) or &quot;Works&quot; (which lacked most of the hits).<br />Now, if you're a die-hard Floyd fan, you might want to think twice before getting this one. For starters, there's probably nothing here that you don't already have, with the possible exception of &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot; (previously unavailable on CD). Also, as stated above, many classics are omitted, including the essential instrumentals &quot;Interstellar Overderive&quot; and &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;. Also, it seems the band chose to ignore certain albums all together, as there are no songs from &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, or &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot; on the album at all. And the classic track &quot;Echoes&quot; has been edited from its original 24 minute length to a much shorter version.<br />The ads for this album have been proclaiming that all the songs are mixed together to form one giant piece of music. This is not exactly the case. Like most Floyd records (Dark Side of the Moon for example), the songs simply fade into one another, andthere are no spaces in between the tracks. And the songs are not in chronological order, so a song like Gilmour's &quot;High Hopes&quot; fades into the Barrett classic &quot;Bike&quot;. This was probably done to make the Gilmour material seem just as strong and important as the Waters/Barret material, but it just makes for some jarring transisitions, as the Gilmour-era Floyd sounds so watered-down compared to the Floyd of old.<br />Bottom line? A good starting point for the curious or new fan, but not essential for die-hards.
0446677450|4.0|I think this book is a good way to establish the beginning skills necessary to reach for economic success. Robert T. Kiyosaki, in this book states that the basic skill necessary to be economically successful in life and to get out of what he calls the &quot;rat race&quot; is to become financially literate; to understand the difference between an asset and a liability and to understand cashflow. He refers to liabilities as things that take money out of your pocket and refers to assets as anything that puts money in your pocket. With these two concepts he builds the basic foundation for the reader to understand how the rich get rich and the poor remain poor. The rich, Kiyosaki states that save their money in assets and increase these assets by reducing their liabilities. He shows the reader how to make money work for them instead of working for money, and get out of the &quot;rat race&quot;. The one downside of this book is that he becomes repetitive, but its only to make the reader understand the importance of his words.
B000053VAF|4.0|This may have had a much bigger budget than Clerks or Mall Rats, but it's hard to tell.  Scripting is fabulous; casting is pretty on-track, with the exception of Alannis Morisette as God.  Or maybe I just felt that way because she annoys the he** out of me.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears... Princess of pop... Oops... this album is totally a grown-up Britney. I'm A Slave 4 U we've all heard, a duet with Justin Timberlake ( *N Sync ), the Dido penned Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman, Boys that takes 'control' the first song after Janet Jackson's to declare so much independence, the cover of I Love Rock n Roll with Britney's amazing voice... Just to name a few of the hot stuff Britney's 3rd album 'Britney' will bring you. Definitely a recommendation for the Britney fans and for the the people who haven't loved her in the past. Rock on Brit!

B000002H5I|5.0|Many years ago Tracy Chapman's debut album captured a part of heart where it still resides to this day. Its introspective and vulnerable lyrics are timeless, rare and about all else, enduring.  No matter how many times I listen to &quot;Fast Car&quot; it always leaves me hopeful and full of promise.  It's a song about the limitless possibilities of life and urgent need to grasp opportunities before they escape us. <br />The tune &quot;If Not Now, But When&quot; is an incredibly poignant song about the desire to be loved and the disappointment that not receiving love brings.  There is no one on this planet that cannot relate to that experience.<br />By all means listen to this recording.  It's ironic mix of melancholy and beautifully textured acoustic rhythms will set your spirit to rest......and Tracy Chapman sings like an Angel.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I had to watch this movie several times, to re-experience the joy and nuttiness some scenes gave me!<br />I would agree with the last reviewer who loved the strange humor and excellent acting.  I loved the story and the music that carried it along.  Not true that the Coen Brothers never read the Odyssey...that was a bit of a joke...they said in another interview that that is their favorite book, and they read it quite often.<br />Loved the characters, but everyone seems to have the impression that it starred Clooney, Turturro, and Goodman, in that order.  They forget Tim Blake Nelson, who had most of lines -- if you don't count Everett's loquacious yammering.  In fact, Blake's character Delmar (&quot;dumber than a bag of hammers&quot;) had the best, funniest, and most provocative lines in the movie.  He also had the right accent, something most of the supposedly Mississipian characters did not.  George Cloony's was on and off, mostly off, although the actor is originally from Kentucky. (Blake is from Oklahoma and sounded dead-on just like my southern relatives.)  <br />The jacket hints that Pete (Turturro) is bad-tempered, but nothing would seem to indicate that he was.  He wasn't as adorable and innocent as Delmar, but he wasn't much brighter. <br />This movie sings! :)
B00005QDW5|4.0|For all those Floyd fans, this is still just a greatest hits album, but one that has a definite flow to it that allows for one long jam.  I found it refreshing to see that it wasn't just a chronological history of the bands favorites, either.  Each and every album is represented here, all of it meshed together and mixed to provide some excellent listening.  Even for long-time fans who remember the days of Meddle, this is one for the road-trips and other momentary lapses of Reason.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|I watched this movie three times. The first time, I thought it w the perfect example of overblown avent garde, with redeeming visual factors. The 2nd time, I was drunk, so I liked it. The third time (gotta give everything a chance) I realized I liked this movie more than the second time, even with the flaws. I flat out found it intriguing. wanna get this? Okay. Close your mental eyes. You have no short term memory. I mean NO short term memory. Anything that happened 15 minute ago has evaporated from your brain. The only way you can identify (NOT REMEMBER!Only long term memories exist) with anything, is by the photos in your pocket, or the bold tattoos you've had inked on your arms and legs. each of these are a direction to solving the murder of your wife, and the bludgeoning that resulted in your memory loss. Now, don't trust anyone, especially those who proclaim themselves to be your friends. Not a bad premise eh? Now, live your life in reverse from a seamy hotel room you're not sure if you rented... The only clues other than the tattoos (they are new each time you wake up) are notes you've jotted down on the backs of polaroids you THINK you've taken. The result? You are basically (...)no matter what you do.<br />The actors? Don't worry about any big names other than Joe Pantelione He's the best of the bunch.<br />I can only tell you this, I was very weirded out. If you enjoyed Things To Do In Denver (Andy Garcia/Christopher Walken) you will count this as a film to watch three times.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|(...)Well, I liked it. There I said it and I'll say it again. I LOVED Tomb Raider, in fact. Angelina was the perfect choice to be Lara, and although I could have done with more character development, I liked all the wacky planetary/time stuff and definitly loved the action sequences. The best part is the bungee ballet, in my opinion. And I'm definitly glad that they cast Chris Barrie (from Red Dwarf, check it out sometime... one of my fave shows) as her butler and not some flatulant old man. ^_^ Bryce was cool too, and that Adam West guy was definitly hunky. Lara would probably kick his bum though. Heh heh. Just watch it and see for yourself to find out if it's good. The only way to know for sure is to make your own opinion. Don't take my word for it, or these other (...). Just check it out!
6304712944|4.0|A musical. But this is NOT a chick flick. This is an era of Hollywood stage-to-screen musicals at it's best. You all know the myth of Arthur, Guinever, and Lancelot in so many permeated forms. This is the one that started it all, and if I must say (oh, I must, I must), it is one of the best (maybe Excalibur). I read Maltin's review, and I gotta tell ya, Maltin needs to crack open a few cold ones and get off the high horse. Yes, Camelot can be a rather stiff translation from stage to screen at times, but take the whole bag or don't take it at all. Richard Harris made his mark with this movie. He is THE King Arthur which all subsequent Arthurs are guaged by. Venessa Redgrave never looked or acted better (I mean that), and the scene where Lancelot (Franco Nero) believed he had killed his friend in a joust, damn near made me cry. It was exceptional, considering this movie was done during the men-don't-cry era. David Hemmings is the perfect bastard as Mordred, Arthur's son by his sister. I don't know why Arthur insisted on calling Guinevere `Jenny', nor Lancelot `Lance'. I presume it was to `update' the film. But it doesn't matter. Every phrase is perfect in it's place. Arthur's solitary prose upon discovering Lancelot's love for Guinvere is a masterpiece in reflection, and it's style is still copied to this day. Something that makes you realize there was such great screenwriting in the 60's. There is a certain sadness in the movies' realization of a time and world lost, yet the songs, `What Do The Simple Folk Do', `Camelot', and `If I Ever Would Leave You' have created an eternal survival for this film. The costuming was typical `clean' serf suits, but the scenery looked as real as could be. And the soundtrack? absolutely magnificant. I am not a big fan of musicals. I am not a fan of overacting. But the background music to this film is as stirring as Armeggeddon, and the cinematography is excellent. There are no flaws in the film-to-dvd translation. If you own Lawrence of Arabia, you will own this. There is a line in this movie, &quot;you will learn that the world wags, and what wags it&quot;. There is magic in this film. It embraces that kind of enchantment. Trust me. I am never wrong.of Arabia, you will own this. There is a line in this movie, &quot;you will learn that the world wags, and what wags it&quot;.

B00005OWIU|5.0|Not since &quot;E.T.&quot; has John Williams crafted such a mesmerizing and evocative score. As if the movie needed any other excitement generator, this score will definitely drive up the interest level, and bears repeated listening.  Williams has given the music his characteristic emotional intensity and symphonic lushness that leaves the listener wanting even more. Buy the CD, see the movie. The world needs a hero like Harry Potter right now!
B000053VAF|5.0|I love Kevin Smith.  I mean, LOVE him.  His movies are the greatest contributions to human society since electricity.  And I'd love to say &quot;Hey this DVD BLOWS!&quot; because firstly I love trashing movies, and secondly, I love the sound of my own voice.  But sadly, this is the best movie I've seen in a LONG time.  Not just the movie is good, so's the DVD.  <BR>Kevin's movie itself, &quot;Dogma&quot; is an awesome story about two renegade angels named Bartleby and Loki (played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon respectively) who may un-make existance if not for the help of a simple lowly human (played by Linda Florentino)who turns out to be more important than she had imagined.  To top it all off, who do you think shows up but a couple of prophets, namely Jay and Silent Bob, also known as &quot;Kevin Smith's cash cows #1 and #2&quot;.  <BR>If the quality of said movie isn't enough for you, the DVDs are awesome.  You won't want to throw the second one away after one viewing like some special edition DVDs I've watched.  There's TONS of deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards, bios, and then my favorite part, the commentary.  Kevin Smith's commentaries are always entertaining, and I end up watching them as much as the movie.  If you have the video and you're thinking of buying this, don't hesitate.  Trust me.
6304077955|5.0|It amused the hell out of me to see how shocked and stunned the film critics were on this one, especially the Americans. This is the side of life that is generally kept hidden from the kids in the 'Burbs, therefore it's DANGEROUS. Not really. I grew up in the north of England and experienced a lot of the stuff seen in this film. It's fairly normal for an intelligent alpha male to experiment with the human condition at cost to others, and it's gone on for many years in civilised countries. We've all met someone like Johnny, we just try to forget about them as quickly as possible. Royalty probably started it, then as education became accessible to the proletariat it filtered down to the masses over the years. Mike Leigh simply bottled it perfectly and put it on film for our endless enjoyment, thank the lordy. Cheers Mike.

0767824571|5.0|I can't remember the first time I watched this movie, but I remember wearing out the video tape.  I realized that it was time for the thing to go.  I bought the edition of the DVD where there was only one DVD.  I just wanted the movie.  I love the movie, I have it memorized.  There's not a week that goes by, that I don't findmyself quoting it.  It's worth the money, believe me.
B00003CWLF|4.0|I love this movie. I have read others' so called &quot;reviews&quot; here and must dispute any negative statements; especially those misguided fools who insist on &quot;reality&quot; when watching a MOVIE, and have no sense of artistic license or drama. Don't you hate those people who insist on tearing apart a film over the minutest of details; like most Americans could really recognize a &quot;fake&quot; English accent if they did'nt know the actress was American already, OY!  For those of you who, like me, are marinating in &quot;reality&quot; 24/7, this was a great escape film, filled with gorgeous cinematography and an entertaining script. Jodie Foster is one of the greatest actresses of our generation and Chow Yun-Fat is a welcome import, a man's man, not a pretty boy who's lack of acting ability is blurred by a dazzling smile. This is an enjoyable film that is loosely based on the diaries of Ms. Anna. It is a remake of the King and I; one that is not an insufferable &quot;musical&quot;. It is a great lie on the couch in the evening and turn out the lights and let the film entertain you kind of movie that is well worth the 2 and a half hours.
B000002ILG|3.0|This band is about the worst in the genre of &quot;hair metal&quot;--due mainly to the vocals of Elmer Fudd, I mean Mike Tramp.  This album is the one of theirs that I can still stand to listen to due to the quality of some of the songs.  &quot;Wait&quot; is a fine, catchy single; and &quot;Tell Me&quot; was a solid follow-up that barely put a dent in the charts.  Most other songs are reasonably catchy, and the epic &quot;Lady Of The Valley&quot; is an anthem that is the highlight of the album.  That song, without a doubt, is the best thing I have ever heard by this band.  On the other end of the spectrum, the closing track and biggest-ever-hit for the band, &quot;When The Children Cry&quot;, is flat-out awful.  What a lame, slow song--and what awful vocals!<br />This band did have some strengths and some good songs in its day--due especially to the quality of the guitar playing.  Overall, though, give me Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, or Winger ANY day over this band.  I love this genre of rock music more than any other, but this band simply doesn't measure up.
B00005OM4N|3.0|&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;well i have to give her this: she has really changed her sound. no more bubblegum songs for this girl (with 1 or 2 exceptions). Britney could be completely switched over to R&amp;B IF she had different lyrics. they still scream &quot;TEENAGER&quot; and they dont move me too much as new and different. and for some reason she feels the urge to talk at the beginning of almost every track.<br />IM A SLAVE 4 U: everyone knows this song. its her first single and my favorite track on the cd. she got away from the bubblegum lyrics on this one, and the beat is tight. excellent choice for a first single. rating from 1 to 5: *****<br />OVERPROTECTED: this song has a tight beat and i really like the warped talking part at the beginning. the first verse it tight and it forecasts an awesome track, but the chorus decreases a little bit and the 2nd verse just lacks the same rockin quality as the first. rating from 1 to 5: ***<br />LONELY: looking at the title, you would think it to be a sad, britney-esque &quot;ballad,&quot; but it turns out to be an angry, dance track about britney leaving her man behind her where she wants him. awesome producing on this track i love the beats. rating from 1 to 5: ****<br />IM NOT A GIRL, NOT YET A WOMAN: a britney spears album would not be a britney spears album without a sweet, sugar-filled slow song about her confusing teenager life ::dreamy sigh:: <BR>i dont really like this track all that much but i think that its actually starting to grow on me. surprisingly, its one of only TWO slow songs on the album! its kind of sweet, but its not doing much for her &quot;new sound.&quot; rating from 1 to 5: ****<br />BOYS: this is my 2nd-favorite track on the album. first of all, she made an excellent choice on the neptunes for her producers on this track. i love the lyrics, the idea of the song, the beat, just everything about this song works. rating from 1 to 5: *****<br />ANTICIPATING: this song has a very seventies disco thing happening in the music and i dont like it. its very happyhappyhappy and bouncy but its kind of cute. rating from 1 to 5: ***<br />I LOVE ROCK 'N ROLL: this has got to be the worst possible remake of this 80s classic. i was skeptical of this song the second i heard she was remaking it in july. the beat is really tight at the beginning and i thought it might not be that bad, but she tried to be too sexy and the song is too slow. i dont like the people shouting b/c even though that was in the original it doesn't work with this version at all. AND her version of the scream after each chorus reallllly makes me mad. this track simply sounds like a pop-remake of a song trying to be rockish that just DIDN'T work. rating from 1 to 5: *<br />CINDERELLA: two bad tracks in a row. i dont like the beat and the lyrics are cheesy. the sound is very techno, and the madonna-like rap in the middle of the song turns me off. however, the chorus is kind of catchy. rating from 1 to 5: **<br />LET ME BE: this song has some pretty catchy lyrics and a nice beat but i dont like the musical contrast between the verses and the chorus: britney sings in her lower register (very rare on this album) during the verses, which makes the high-pitched chorus sound very very whiney and sreechy. rating from 1 to 5: ***<br />BOMBASTIC LOVE: cute beat. the lyrics are a teeny bit cheesy in the chorus: &quot;bombastic love, so fantastic, where im completely yours and you are mine. and its gonna be exactly like in a movie, when we fall in love for the first time.&quot; can't decide how much i like it or not. rating from 1 to 5: ****<br />THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME: this is the second slow song on the album, with a sort of dance-groove chorus. its very sweet and i think she said she wrote this one about justin. i dont like the lyric &quot;up into the cryasal sky&quot; tho. very poppish, and the lalalalalalas arent doing much for me. rating from 1 to 5: ***<br />WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE ME: this one was written by justin timberlake and wade robson, about what britney looks for in a man. i like it alot and justin does the background vocals on this track, and he does some rap and beat-boxing too. its a tight track and britneys vocals are the best on the album, and they sound REALLY good with justins. rating from 1 to 5: *****<br />overall: pretty good 3rd album. should you buy it? your call. its one of those albums where you're gonna love it or you're gonna hate it, but i think that if you've like ANY of her music before this, then you will find at least a couple of songs on here that you really really dig. &lt;/b&gt;
B000002VRZ|4.0|The Outlaws are probably the most musically talented of all the Southern rock bands. Their blistering guitar solos, send shivers up and down my spine. Hughie Thomasson in my opinion is in the same class as Eric Clapton and all the other great guitar players. It appears that the song selection for this disc was put together by Hughie Thomasson and Henry Paul, and there for the songs focus on material released when Henry Paul was with the band. There are some songs that should have made this disc, but were not included, such as \\"Devils Road\\" and \\"White Horses\\" written by former guitar army veteran Freddie Salem. The Outlaws released an album on Pasha records in the mid-eighties which included great songs as \\"What You Don't Do\\",\\"Cold Harbor\\" and \\"One Last Ride\\". (If anyone knows were I can get this album on disc, please contact me.)which for legal reasons (I'm guessing?) did not make this greatest hits package.<BR>Although the lyrics in the Outlaws music are not as strong as say Lynyrd Skynyrd, this is a great rock and roll band that has conviction and dedication to their music. I would recommend this disc to anyone interested in learning about a great Southern rock band and its music. Some of my fondest memories in my life include Outlaws concerts and their music. Buy this disc, you won't be dissapointed. Rest in Peace Billy Jones.

0792156684|1.0|We live in a strange world. Comic books are being written that are intelligent and poetic. Yet, I have a hard time trying to think of a good movie made in the last ten years. The problems with this film are almost limitless.<BR> 1. It is historically inaccurate.<BR> 2. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio. He is the archtypical pretty-boy actor (this position was once held by Tom Cruise). He handsome in away that makes teenage girls croon and every one else want to bash his face in with a sledgehammer. _Casablanca_ and _The African Queen_ (the two greatest love stories of film) starred Humphrey Bogart who is ugly as a mule, but unlike any leading &quot;man&quot; today, he could act with great subtlety.<BR> 3. ...

B00005R23S|5.0|To give you some historical perspective first, I joined the Bruce bandwagon around 1975 - relatively late by some standards. I first heard Bruce in concert in 1978 on a radio broadcast of a full show from the Darkness tour. I saw him in Largo, MD for the River Tour in 1980, the Born in the USA Tour in 1984, the two album tour in 1992 and the reunion tour in Philadelphia in 1999. This DVD is worth every penny for any fan of rock and roll music and is required for every Bruce fan. The sound and picture are absolutely perfect. After viewing several bootleg videos from the 70's and 80's, it is awesome to see real camera work, hear clean sound and see Bruce at his best. He has not lost a thing. In fact, of the concerts I've seen, the Philly concert in September 1999 and these NYC concerts on the DVD are the best. My TV is 32 inches, but if you are considering buying a surround sound system or a big screen TV - now is the time. This is a DVD I'll play over and over (unlike any other music video or any video for that matter). <br />All of the standard songs are terrific but, strange as this may sound, I liked Land of Hope and Dreams the best. It, along with 41 Shots, shows Bruce still has the writing ability and his music continues to grow with the times. I'd stack Hope and Dreams up there with his best tunes. It was a treat to see some of the Tracks tunes (The Promise, My Love Will Not Let You Down, Don't Look Back) and they were excellent; though Rendezvous (featured at the Philly show) and Loose Ends (two of the best Tracks tunes that would have worked on a number of his albums) would have been nice additions. Which brings me to a small request to Bruce: When are discs three and four from the tour going to be released?<br />Thank you Bruce for giving back to the fans.

B00005NI5Y|5.0|Every time Bob releases a new collection the entire world is eager to proclaim it his best since...Blood on the Tracks?  John Wesley Harding?  Blonde on Blonde?  Bringin' It All Back Home?  This type of grading system becomes awkward and ineffective when evaluating CLASSIC Dylan, as this most definitely is.  For all the positive press and critical acclaim Time Out of Mind gets, Love and Theft puts it to shame.  The closest thing to filler you'll find here is Bye and Bye, which is a little goofy and out of place here in my book.  What can I say about Mississippi?  The song I've been waiting for from Bob for years.  Reflective and strong, daring and brave.  For those who question Dylan's voice, I can recommend no better vehicle to demonstrate it's power than this.  Dylan's voice is not just an instrument.  It's a WEAPON.  No one else on the planet could capture the essence of this instant classic the way Bob does.  Thank you for that one, Bob.  There's diversity here as well.  Who else could create a mood and feeling the way Dylan does with Highwater, and then follow that up with Moonlight?  Summer Days is another highlight here.  The intracacies of Bob's phrasing are sharp and effective.  This collection is a must-have.  I speak as a lifelong fan of Dylan when I say this.  How will anyone else feel about Love and Theft?  I can't begin to imagine.  Who says you can't come back all the way?

Dad received a Silver Star (which, when you read the citation, you would swear is as much deserving of the Medal of Honor as a lot of those citations I have read), and, because his company was so decimated, had to have 2nd Lt. bars pinned on him on the battlefield.  He suffered all his life with various ailments traceable to living, eating, sleeping in the mud on Okinawa, never complaining or burdening other Americans to pay him disability, and died in 1981. Dad never lived to see his grandson, Kyle, have 2nd Lt. bars pinned on him at West Point. (Or did he?).

B000002U3P|5.0|I consider the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Trainspotting&quot; one of the most definitive soundtrack in modern music. There is an eclectic mix of artists and bands that ranges from alternative to techno, mixing old songs with new songs. This soundtrack couldn't have started off on a better note than with Iggy Pop's classic &quot;Lust For Life&quot;, both a film and commercial favorite. The thunderous beats and Iggy's raw vocals mixes nicely together and makes the listener get up and dance. &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, another Iggy Pop song, is excellent. A bit monotonous at times but I just love how deep Iggy's voice gets on this song. It has a trip hop influence in the song, long before the term trip hop was defined. Sleeper's cover of the Blondie classic &quot;Atomic&quot; is excellent without a doubt. Catchy and darn right fun to listen to. I almost love this version more than the original and I love Blondie's music to death. I think my very personal favorite track off the soundtrack has to be New Order's &quot;Temptation&quot;. Elastica's &quot;2:1&quot; is awesome. That is probably my all time favorite Elastica song. It's short and sweet. The timing of the beats in the song and Justine Frischman's vocals is what blows my mind away. And of course there is Underworld's &quot;Born Slippy&quot;, the song that put this soundtrack on the map as well as for the band. That song and Leftfield's &quot;A Final Hit&quot; are just classic techno music. What I love most about this cd is how it eclectic it is and that the artists and bands put on the album are/were both established and new. You don't see established artists and new artists on the same album very often. The film industry should use the &quot;Trainspotting&quot; soundtrack as an architect to how soundtracks should be, as art and not another form of crass commercialism.

B000002C1W|5.0|15 years later people are still complaining about this cd. Let me tell you, the best thing that could have happened to pink floyd was to have roger waters leave. how long did he think he could exploit syd barrett's dimentia? The work they turned out with waters was fantastic and I loved it but &quot;The Final Cut&quot; proved that things were getting stale. The PF style is obvious on AMLOR but it's missing the oppressive, smothering self pity that Waters injected. This allows them to truly perform and improvise, not just mimic past works. No where in the PF chronicles does anything like &quot;Terminal Frost&quot; appear. Listening to Gilmour trade licks with Tom Scott's sax is a musical feast -- a simplistic tune performed by the musical elite. How about &quot;One Slip&quot; or &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;? Is there a PF type message there? Well, you have to put down your bong and pay attention but yes there is. I love this cd. I've had to replace it twice because I wore it out but that's the mark of a great work, after 15 years people are still talking about it.
B0000047CW|5.0|How do you critique the album that started an era? Forty years later, Jazz Samba is still one of the most relaxing, rhythmically pleasing albums made. All instrumental, with the tenor sax of Stan Getz (the guy John Coltrane professed to admire!) and inspired guitar of Charlie Byrd. The entire album was recorded in one session in the performance hall of a Washington, D.C., church, and it puts legions of studio albums to shame.<br />While Desafinado and Bahia are the best known tracks, the album is a seamless experience and it is difficult to single out certain songs as superior. If Getz is one of the masters of the tenor saxophone, it is also hard to separate his proficiency from the effort as a whole -- it truly comes across as a tight ensemble effort. (For a contrast, Duke Ellington's masterful and equally essential Money Jungle released the same year finds the trio of Ellington, Mingus and Max Roach locked in a musical duel on a couple of tracks.)<br />Favorites? I enjoy Samba de Uma Nota So, but every time I reach for Jazz Samba I alway listen to the entire album. At least once. This and Getz/Gilberto belong in every jazz collection.
0790749815|5.0|I was fortunate to have studied this movie in detail during a college film class, and 20 years later, it remains my favorite all time Alfred Hitchcock flick (and the master justifies many of my favorites over time.)  Very few films are able to retain the one-two punch of being classics within a genre and remain remarkably fresh, accessible and fun (yes, even fun!)  Cary Grant is amazing throughout as the executive mistaken for someone else by both criminals and the authorities.  Few of his contemporaries (or even actors since Grant's glory days) ever mastered the dual qualities of being both manly and approachable which Grant offers in spades.  He is the everyday simple man, on the order of a James Stewart, and yet, a leading man matinee idol that has charmed viewers for decades.  He lures you with his affect, but never in a way that feels tired or condescending, always with good nature and a crooked eyebrow that knows more about life than most full fledged characters ever placed on screen.<br />The movie moves from New York through the Heartland, to fields of corn, to a climax that is visually and emotionally stunning.  The supporting characters all lend crediblity to the zig zag tale that rarely allows the viewer to catch his or her breath.  Eva Marie Saint and James Mason are especially delicious, and the viewer is forced repeatedly to question whether they are good guys, bad guys or neither, which only adds to the fun.  <br />Great actors and filmmaking aside, what makes &quot;North By Northwest&quot; especially important in today's world are its still-vital themes and how these relate to the ever-changing world we live in.  Cases of mistaken identity are more present now than before, as Muslims and Arab Americans confront the spectacle of being reduced to second class citizens despite their long, proud history and embrace of American values, and the American Dream itself.  Grant's character is literally hounded by both good and evil, but retains intact his inner virtues, and knows deep inside where he stands, like our Muslim and Arab countrymen, and most of the world's human population.  <br />In addition, Grant's &quot;everyman&quot; could be any one of us which adds to the suspense and allows us to feel a bond with this character that is rare among Hitchcock leads.  In fact, Hitchcock seems to have originated &quot;racial profiling&quot; here - albeit for the omnipresent &quot;white man.&quot;  If you think about it, mistaken identities are often the driving force behind racial profiling and the Master truly drives this point home.  Again, knowing this only makes the film more impoactful and adds to its universality today.<br />Finally, in an era of bioterrorism and unprecendented disasters like the attacks on the World Trade Centers of 9-11, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; seems more contemporary now than even 30+ years ago.  The cropduster scene takes on new resonance given what we're witnessing at the moment with anthrax, and the days immediately following the terrorist events, when cropdusters and other small planes were forced to suspend operation.  <br />Plus, the events of September 11th appear supremely tied to what transpires at Mt Rushmore during near the end of the film.  Think about it - like the hijacker's destruction of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, beloved icons for modern Americans, the Presidential busts carved into the side of the mountain as used in the film are literally extensions of our pride, patriotism, heritage and history.  They represent all that &quot;is good&quot; in America, and applaud the democracy that has led the world for centuries to new, unparalleled glories.  The evil characters in the film are foiled by the mountain, and the all-American Grant endures (as shall we.)  While a mountain can't implode like the Towers themselves, the ground around them can be desacrated by murderers, and Hitchcock foreshadows the tragedies of 9-11 with uncanny vision.  The four Presidents on the mountain seem to stare down at Grant and give him the power to go on, while at the same time toppling the assailants.  Like them, our 6 living Presidents, from Ford to Bush, have crossed party lines and formed unilateral, unprecedented loyalty in the fact of terror.  If only life were fiction like Hitchcock's tale, perhaps the themes he presents would not be as terrifyingly real as they actually feel at this fateful moment in time!  I hate to read into this, but Hitchcock speaks volumes in this film about the nature of our culture, the values that sustain and inspire us, as well as the forces that would prefer to see us destroyed.  <br />On DVD, &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, reaffirms its status as the Master's truest work of art and renews his position as the greatest filmmaker of his day.  You can escape with this movie, but realize that, more today than ever the film generates a passion and vision that is more real, more intense and far more frieghtening than ever before.  Justice prevails, as it always does, yet Hitchcock makes the viewer go through hell first!  Just like the world's civilized nations are coping with terror  today, so does the Grant character.  A joyous, supreme example of filmmaking that is unparalleled both in its cinematic achievment as well as its topicality.
B00005QIPH|5.0|First off, Julian Casablanca's voice is something I personally cannot get enough of.  Whether he's crooning or on the brink of screaming, you can just feel every bit of emotion thats been brewing in his mind.  The band itself is just incredibly tight with bouncing rhythms and some bittersweet guitar playing.  The CD is flawless, even the track that replaced NYC Cops is gem of its own. Just songs that I can't ever forget.  Overall, while people say it might not be original, its the best music to hit these ears in a long while.  Say what you will, I'm absolutely ecstatic they're here and I pray they stay.
0441172717|5.0|Herbert's classic!  I won't bore you (like many other reviewers) by telling you an abbreviated version of the story.  Just know this: this book is simply amazing.  The movies pale in comparison.  GET THIS BOOK!
B00005OM4N|5.0|If you were hoping for her to churn out baby one more time for the third time, then this one is not for you.  The first single should tip you off that your in for something much more mature and less fluffy pop.  Overprotected, Lonely, and Boys are gonna be great club songs.  Don't fear the track Cinderella.  It's not the queezy pop ballad it sounds like it would be.  Nearly every song inspires you to get up and dance.  With the sole slow song Not a Girl hitting every note wonderfully.  Her voice has made shocking improvements.  She's managed to keep it clean for her young fans, while making it enjoyable for teens, and young adults.  It's clear she'll be one of the soul survivors of the teen boom.  This is definetely an enjoyable album.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Okay, let me say this right up front, I am a Britney fan.  She has some really catchy songs, nothing that will go down in history, but they are fun.<br />This is almost unlistenable and I'm really sorry I bought it.  The problem is with the production, I think, because the beats and stuff just sound lame.

B00005QDW5|4.0|Nick Mason, David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Syd Barrett, and Richard Wright did the world great service by deciding to become professional musicians. Since the 1960s, Pink Floyd has been one of the greatest, most innovative music groups of recent memory. An almot infinite number of positive adjectives can be said of their music; however, words are essentially meaningless when it comes to trying to capture a sense of their music's beauty. <br />If music has any greatness, any long-lasting impact, and if it genuinely solicits your emotions, it has to be heard to be truly felt and understood. This applies as well to the music of Beethoven as it does to this consistently amazing band. For anyone who has just discovered Pink Floyd, this album is highly recommended as a \\"primer\\". It showcases the band's evolution, from its wild earlier days with vocalist Syd Barrett, to its more familiar sound with the addition of bassist/vocalist/lyricist Roger Waters. After Waters' rift with David Gilmour, the band continued to create wonderful music, which it is by now cliche to be referred to as \\"atmospheric.\\" <br />This compilation is no mere greatest hits strung together carelessly by the royalty-holders in an effort to grab that cash with both hands and make a stash. The tracks have been selected with care, seamlessly edited together, and ordered in such a way that you can draw connections between their earlier and later works. My one qualm is that my favourite song, \\"Echoes\\", was surgically truncated in five or six places; as the song was originally 23 minutes long, I'm not surprised. So, if you don't have the complete albums from which the tracks are culled, buy this NOW dammit!<br />Being 21 in a time when music produced by and for those my age group is more boring and lifeless than a church sermon is quie sad. I get the feeling that any given period of time can only have so many great artistic geniuses. We'll have to wait a while for another Stanley Kubrick, or Pablo Picasso, or Pink Floyd to come along and re-invigorate our tiny yet sweet little lives. Until then, shine on you crazy diamonds....

B000058983|5.0|LOVE's forever changes is one of the best albums I have ever heard. I bought this album about a month ago and I cant stop listening to it. Alone again or is such a gerat song and the rest of the songs in the album are just as great. Alot of people have not heard this great album so if you see this album buy it, you won't be let down. One more thing, if you don't like this album you don't know what good albums are about.

0553583182|5.0|This book reveals and awes you of our existence, after you read this book most of you will realize that we are not alone that god created our mind as the strongest weapon and we just have to know how to use our mind, whatever man could imagine and truly believe in will come true and dr. joseph murphy teaches you just how to effectively. Too many people deal with problems externally and try to fix it externally when they dont realize its internally is what caused it in the first place, and internally means your subconscious mind the mind that doesnt reason but acts accordingly to believe and thought. Sounds easy, but believe me it is not easy too many have read this book over and over again and still cant apply these tecqniques even though they understand the teachings of this book. The problem is and with alot of people is after a while you will forget about it or when some problem erupts they find themselves dealing with their problems  externally again. Because it takes alot of effort and after a while people would rather turn to the quickest satisfying desire way out. It actually depends though if you are one who is in the habit of using your emotions to live ur live when you got a brain but dont use it you will find these techniques much harder to apply, and those who are well organized may be less the effort but they may not learn alot cuz their lives are satisfied they dont got much problems and therefore they dont have to put much effort, contrary to those who have the most problems in life may learn much more but in a longer period of trial and error. My final words is no matter how much effort it may take for you, buy this book anyways it could improve ur life from any aspect and change your whole perspective on how you think and react to things. After reading this book some may accomplish great things and others will become great and master the secret to tap in their infinity riches of their subsconsious mind,
B00003CXA4|5.0|&#34;Gandhi&#34; is a brilliant encapsulation of the life of the man who must be counted among the greatest, most admirable figures in the history of humankind.  Starring Ben Kingsley, Martin Sheen, Candice Bergen, Rohini Hattangady, Roshan Seth, John Gielgud, and Trevor Howard, and directed by Richard Attenborough, this 1982 film is a stunning achievement - without doubt one of the finest biographical epics ever made.  It garnered six Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Best Actor (Kingsley); and Best Director (Attenborough).  This film beautifully fulfills the goals set out in the film's preface: &#34;...to be faithful in spirit to the record and try to find one's way to the heart of the man...&#34;<br /><br />As this film demonstrates, Mohandas K. Gandhi, always faithful to his principles of equality, justice, and peace, uses non-violent civil disobedience as a means to gain equality for his nation's oppressed.  his weapon. He is repeatedly assaulted by police and is imprisoned - usually on trumped up charges - several times because of his political beliefs and activism. Yet this always gentle and humble gentle man never loses sight of his main goal: helping his people achieve political and economic equality.  Although only marginally successful, Gandhi becomes famous throughout the world for his work in South Africa and India.<br /><br />In this masterfully produced, directed, written, and acted film, the life of Mohandas K. Gandhi is painted against the backdrop of some of the most momentous events in twentieth century Indian history.  &#34;Gandhi&#34; shows how the Mahatma (Great Soul) leads a nation of 350 million people to freedom from British colonial rule using non-violent means.<br /><br />We see Gandhi at the outset, making speeches in his low-key style, but even then espousing his clearly defined doctrine of peaceful non-cooperation against a repressive British colonial rule.  Contrary to many public perceptions of the man, this film shows that Gandhi was not just a simple, humble man in a loincloth.  He was a shrewd, pragmatic man who knew the value of good press in the furtherance of his cause.  He knew how to confront his political enemies in ways that got his point across while garnering from his foes a grudging respect.<br /><br />Throughout all these tumultuous events, Gandhi never wavers from his belief in non-violent civil resistance as a means of achieving justice, equality, and freedom for the Indian nation.<br /><br />January 30, 1948: a supreme irony:  Mohandas K. Gandhi - the man of peace who consistently espouses the dignity of all people; the proponent of non-violence, equality, justice, and peace - is violently gunned down by an assassin working for a fanatic Hindu group.<br />There are simply not enough  superlatives to do adequate justice to &#34;Gandhi.&#34;  Every aspect of this film is masterfully done!<br /><br />Ben Kingsley's portrayal of Gandhi is one of those singular performances that is so good that it defies description.  His meticulous preparation for this part is readily evident in every scene in which he appears.  His physical resemblance to the real Gandhi,  and the way he mimicked Gandhi's mannerisms, is so realistic as to be positively eerie.  Kingsley's performance is always sensitive, even slightly understated.  Yet there is always present a powerful intensity that conveys the deep spirituality and integrity of the man he so lovingly portrays.<br /><br />Other performances, although nowhere near as wide-ranging, are no less outstanding.  Among them:  John Gielgud as the slighly addled, pompous British viceroy, Lord Irwin; Trevor Howard as the British judge whose respect for defendant Gandhi leads him to rise from his seat in deference to the man he is about to sentence to prison; Roshan Seth as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the staunchly loyal disciple and future Indian Prime Minister; and  Rohini Hattangady as Gandhi's loving wife.<br /><br />A NOTE ABOUT THE DVD:  &#34;Gandhi,&#34; a 20-year old film, was only released on DVD for the first time in October 2001.  This a truly magnificent restoration and remastering of this great film! It's the first time that &#34;Gandhi&#34; appears on recorded media in its original 2.35:1 widescreen format.

B00005QIPH|5.0|Wearing their influences on their collective sleeves, the Strokes  sound at times like The Clash, The Who, The Cure, The Jam and even U2, but despite obvious influences sound uniquely like The Strokes.  A paradox, but true.  Just about the most simple song structures you can imagine, but great hooks and good vocals.  Get it.
6304297912|1.0|after hearing about how 'great' this movie was and seeing all the good reviews, i finally rented it. and i HATED it. i hate this movie more than any other movie i've ever seen. i can't exactly tell you why...the characters were boring, and worthless, I didn't feel any sympathy for them at all. This movie just glorified drug use. bleh. i'll give it 1 star for ewan.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney's latest reminds me of a paint-by-numbers kit: it is so calculated and prefab every song sounds like one you've heard before.  There are heavy influences by Janet Jackson, and several songs that are Britney's version of &quot;Control.&quot;  Britney ooohs, ahhhhs, and groans through each song stating how she is on the cusp of womanhood and wants to be treated as such.  I'm sorry, but after her striptease on the 2000 MTV Awards, NO ONE thinks of her as a little girl.  Further, the relevance of the songs is lost on anyone not on a cheerleading squad or part of the glee club.  If Britney wants to make the transition from teen star to adult entertainer, she needs to make the songs a bit more relevant to an older market.  Is the album all bad?  Not by a long shot.  The album is what it is: a pleasant piece of pop music which is indistinquishable from all of the other standard pop fare on the radio.  While Britney's voice has never been strong, she has star quality (like Madonna), and I was hoping for a bit more than BRITNEY: CHEERLEADER BLUES.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I am more than a little disappointed with the Best of Pink Floyd CD set.  First of all, most of the songs by Syd Barrett should not have been included.  I don't own A Saucerful of Secrets and The Pipers at the Gates of Dawn... and now I know why.  The songs just take up space on this CD.  Second, why not include songs like &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;, &quot;Brain Damage/Eclipse&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, The Gunner's Dream&quot;, &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; and &quot;Take It Back&quot;?  These songs are all better than at least half the songs presently on the CD.  Were any Pink Floyd fans consulted in compliling the song list?
1570425671|5.0|While I have found the books by David Sedaris funny his deanpan delivery on the tapes ads a whole new dimension.  His way of turning a simple subject such as trying to ask a butcher for meat in French or getting some remodling done are turned into hilariously insiteful tales due to his attention to detail and wonderful ability to mine for the ridiculous in almost any situation.  His books have kept me awake at night laughing and this CD made me wish my morning commute was longer so I could hear it all at once.  He has many imitators but is still the best.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I didn't think Britney could do it, but she has. Her new album is better than her last two by far. Is it possible for every track to be awesome? Well, this album is you answer - YES! There's the beautiful ballads, the yummy bubble gum pop, the sophisticated hip hop groove tracks and the bouncy upbeat drum tracks. It's perfect. The only song that falls a little short is &quot;What it's like to be me&quot; - but many folks love it, so you may too. Get it,  get it!!!!
6305878323|5.0|This is great because it's in widescreen. The images are clear, the colours are bright, and this has the look of a restored version (or at least a good print). The R &amp; R Sherman songs never date and you will find modern children all over England and America singing along to Chim Chim Cheree and A Spoonful Of Sugar just as their parents did. David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife. The two children are probably the least irritating in cinema history and were something of a casting coup for Disney, when compared with the horrid child actors in most of their output. But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is. You can imagine, say a Petula Clark or a Diana Rigg as Mary Poppins, but only Van Dyke could play Bert the way he does. Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co-stars. The one disappointment is that there aren't any extras on this disc (I don't call scene selection a feature!).
B00004XOWM|2.0|To start this review, I'm am going to say that Limp Bizkit didn't sell out. They just made a really bad adjustment. 3 Dollar Bill Y'all was a great debut, and Significant Other was nothing short of awesome. But this CD is very uncreative and unoriginal.<br />To start, is the guy who wrote &quot;Hot Dog&quot; the same person who wrote &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; and &quot;No Sex&quot;? Freddy has seen to gone stupid, using the F Word more than 46 times in a song. This isn't the only song; the next tracks, &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Full Nelson&quot;, which has just as much concentration on curses.<br />&quot;My Way&quot; is a pretty cool song, and &quot;Rollin&quot; is a good song for the first 2 or 3 listens, but it becomes repetitive. &quot;Livin It Up&quot; is the worst rap-rock song ever, plain and simple.<br />&quot;The One&quot; is an excellent song, I must say that. But then it gets followed by the weak &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;.<br />Then, something magic happens, 3 good songs in a row. &quot;Take A Look Around&quot; is the MI-2 theme, and an excellent song. &quot;It'll Be Okay&quot; is next, which is a good quality song with depressing lyrics. &quot;Boiler&quot; is the CD's best track, showing Fred's talent, which he seems to be running out of.<br />&quot;Hold On&quot; is the weakest track on this CD, not only because I dislike Mr. Weiland's recent work, but it's very boring. &quot;Rollin (Urban)&quot; is just another weak, unoriginal rap track.<br />The &quot;Outro&quot; with Ben Stiller is funny the first time but then gets annoying.<br />This CD is not essential for your collection. If you have Significant Other but not 3$BYall, get that and skip this.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is a more mature style, I love Britney
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD is just a perfect example of a band making an excellent CD like this and following it up with a (bad) CD. This CD is an excellent CD with many great songs.<br />\\"Nookie\\", \\"Break Stuff\\", and \\"Show Me What You Got\\" are awesome shout along anthems, \\"Re-Arranged\\", \\"Don't Go Off Wandering\\", \\"No Sex\\" are songs with great meanings, and \\"I'm Broke\\", \\"Nobody Like You\\", and \\"Trust\\" are great alt-rock songs.<br />\\"Just Like This\\" and \\"N 2 Gether Now\\" are weak, but that's about it. If you got Choc. Starfish, hated it and don't have Significant Other, give Limp another chance, try this.
B00004STPT|5.0|I am one of the few here who owns this CD, but have never seen the movie. I bought this disc from a city street hawker; it was a complete unknown, but since others had recommended the movie to me, I took a chance on the soundtrack. I love this music. It can be background, foreground, or inspirational music; each track adds a flavor that all add up to a very filling whole. I think it is one of Zimmer's masterstrokes to have each track run into the next, making the whole disc almost one piece, instead of 17. My personal favorite track is, surprising to many, 14: I am a Gregorian Chant buff and the quoting of the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; is, in my mind, chilling and haunting. This film, on the basis of its soundtrack alone, is definitely on my &quot;to-see&quot; list.
B000002N2Z|5.0|There might not be a band better than this band, the Deftones (well, maybe Tool...). This is where it all started, with their most heavy and raw sound. Chino does a lot more screaming than usual, which is a minor letdown, but this is some of Steph's best riffs.<br />My favorite songs on this CD are \\"Bored\\", \\"Minus Blindfold\\", \\"One Weak\\", \\"Engine No. 9\\", and my favorite, \\"Nosebleed\\".<br />Thank you, Madonna, for signing this incredible band (Maverick is a Madonna-owned label, I know I'm such a (wise guy)). I love this debut. Get it today.
0812550757|5.0|I have always thought it a little ironic that both &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker&quot; both recieved the Hugo and Nebula Awards. To my mind, the only connection they have with science fiction is the fact that they take place in a time when interstellar travel is prevalent. The purpose of science fiction is to get people excited about the future of technology: to revive in our culture the scientific optimism that got us to the Moon. Neither of these books -- and I discuss them as a unit, even though they are so different, with such different scope -- comes anywhere close to that. &quot;Speaker&quot; especially, is a work that asks much deeper quesions about human nature than science can answer satisfactorily.<br />&quot;Speaker For The Dead&quot; is my candidate for Greatest Fiction Work of the Twentieth Century. I do not say this lightly, even though I have not read all of the fiction, even that labeled &quot;great literary fiction,&quot; that literary critics have canonized. &quot;Speaker&quot; transcends literary genres and prototypes. I doubt whether science fiction has ever been used to pose so many eternal questions. It is not simply a great novel: it is a work of philosophy couched in a story. This book may be fictional, but it is True! The events of Speaker may never actually happen, but the world Card has painted for us is no longer a painting, but has sprung up into a full-scale universe.<br />It is too bad that Card could not have limited himself to &quot;Speaker,&quot; instead of forcing himself to draw out the story into &quot;Xenocide,&quot; and then &quot;Children of the Mind.&quot; Neither of those two lives up to &quot;Speaker&quot;'s elegant simplicity and unavoidable probing questioning into the heart of every reader. These two are science fiction -- their worlds eminently don't work, and I'm not talking about the physics. His characters become stylized, form fitted; he is shaping the plot to find an ending, and finds he has to extend and distend it to make that ending satisfactory. I have a similar criticism of &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;: they do not ask the profound questions that &quot;Ender's Game&quot; did; they stay on the plane of events.and distend it to make that ending satisfactory. I have a similar criticism of &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;: they do not ask the profound questions that &quot;Ender's Game&quot; did; they stay on the plane of events.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I think that this album is bring out Britney's sexualities. I try not listening to 'I'm a Slave', since the radio stations have over played it. I also tried not to listen to 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman' since that's support to be Britney's next hit in the album. I basically listened to the other songs on the album and realize that some are about having freedom from a guy like 'Lonely' and maybe 'Cinderella'. Not really sure what that song's about. I think she did a really great job of remaking the song 'I Love Rock 'N' Roll'. My favorite songs from this album, beside 'I'm A Slave', 'Anitcipating' because it had this disco type of music in the background &amp; it's kind of nice to dance to. Or at least roller skate to (like in Mya's 'Free&quot; video). I also like 'Overprotected' because the beat feels powerful &amp; Britney tell wants to be she own self. By the way, the movie Britney's in is called 'Overprotected', so you should see a video of that song sometime soon.
B00005QDW5|3.0|An acceptable attempt at achieving the impossible. On the plus side, the inclusion of 5 Barrett tracks is commendable. And most of Floyd's classics are well represented. As for the downside, &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; (1967) should have been included, not to mention the unreleased &quot;Vegetable Man&quot; and &quot;Scream Thy Last Scream.&quot; What happened to 1969 and 1970? And many of the segues, though tolerable, are less than perfect. But the biggest complaint I have is with the edited version of &quot;Echoes.&quot; Firstly, the sound doesn't seem psychedelic enough. I have a Japanese import of Meddle on vinyl that renders this CD version of &quot;Echoes&quot; sonically inferior. Furthermore, disc 1 clocks in at over 76 minutes, so why did they chop out over 7 minutes of this masterpiece when they still had over 3 minutes to play with? They not only chopped out passages from the intro and extended 'noise' sections; they also removed key parts of the buildup prior to the 'funky' jam and portions of the 'funky' jam itself. One of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces!
B00005S6K8|5.0|Harrison Ford is a great actor but, he need the rest of the stars in order to be great and with the crew that was pick it, could'nt be more perfect!
B00003CXTG|1.0|I tried hard to find something to like about this movie, but other than Hans Zimmer's film score (and even that was substandard compared to his other works), this movie was a massive disappointment.  <br />Based on the bad reviews, I went in with low expectations and Michael Bay failed to meet even those.  Although Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale tried hard with a bad script, aside from their efforts the acting was cardboard, the dialogue was shallow, the love-story plot was predictable and unoriginal, the special effects were WAY overpriced (prop planes don't fly like X-wing fighters), and the history-well, from end to end the movie was replete with historical errors, from mundane stuff (e.g., incorrect uniforms, wrongly painted aircraft) to more serious errors (e.g., Doolittle Raid bombers flying in formation, at altitude, with fighter pilots at the controls, providing running commentary on the radio, etc. etc. etc.)  By themselves, each of the errors is insignificant, but taken together, they give the lie to Bay's claim that this would be the most historically accurate film possible.  They also raise the question:  if you're going to spend this much money to make a movie, isn't worthwhile to get your facts straight (especially when you don't have to be a history professor to get them)?  <br />About the only good thing I can say about this moive is that if it helps to instill some appreciation of our country's history in people who didn't have that appreciation before, then it will have served a good purpose.  But if you want an accurate historical portrayal of Pearl Harbor (using real aircraft as opposed to unrealistic pretenders), you're not going to do better than \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\"  If you want a quality love story set against the backdrop of the Pearl Harbor attack, you can't beat \\"From Here to Eternity.\\"  As far as this one goes, save your money.  I wish I had.
6301954947|5.0|This film is available on dvd albeit PAL U.K. version not NTSC as yet. The DVD version I have is in flawless widescreen. It is a truly awesome film. The sound, cinematography and sheer scope of the battle scenes are incredible. I have lots of epic war films and this one is right up there with my favourite top 5 along side Patton, Gettysburg, Stalingrad... I really sympathise with those that have only seen the VHS version.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Not a bad album, certainly. At least it's rock and roll. A lot of other good bands have been accused of ripping off VU. I remember about 8 years ago, there was this band called Urge Overkill, hyped out the wazoo, put out an album called Saturation, then promptly disappeared (somebody had a drug problem, as I recall). Saturation was 10 times the album this is.
6304140711|4.0|when i first heard about this movie i didn't know Mark Wahlberg was in it until i watched it. i was in like total shock, but if you ask me i thoght it was a really good movie but not his best. to me i thought he did really well in three kings and perfect storm. Neways back to Fear i thought it was great and ne 1 that hasn't seen it should. i just had a problem with the end. i'm not going to say nething b/c i dont wanna ruin it for those who havn't seen it but i did not like it. i know i know it wouldn't make sence if it didn't happen and not every movie has to be perfect but i guess its b/c i like him so much i just didn't like it you know, but of course thats my opinion right. well i just wanted to make my point and get this out to every 1 pluse i had nothing else to do. (...)
B00005QDW5|4.0|A pretty good collection of Pink Floyd hits.  I don't necessarily agree with all of them.  Who but PF could sell yet another CD with the same old stuff?  As always with PF the packaging is neat, I always enjoy the visual art that comes along with the music.  I took one star away for the same old stuff, I did enjoy the addition of The Wall's &quot;When the tigers broke free&quot;.
B000000IRB|5.0|My favorite album of all time and even better in gold.  I got it used but the sound quality is amazing.
B000002C1V|5.0|I have heard so much criticism about this masterpiece, that I thought it would be virtuous to disillusion all the unsure poets out there who are looking for good drama. You will indubitably find drama here, blooming like a lotus flower, spreading like a pool of blood, erupting over the hills like Napoleons army.<br />The fact that this album is poorly rated is because ignorant people listen to it. It stands apart from Pink Floyds other works, and to me, is much better than Pink Floyds other works. It is a honed Wall,  a sharpened Dark Side of the Moon, a chapel, an alter to mankind itself and what we have to lose.<br />Do not listen to this album and compare it to any Pink Floyd you have ever listened to before, you will be doing both the band and yourself a gargantuan injustice.<br />Doug
B00005QDW5|5.0|This Cd rocks.  Pink Floyd has been my Favorite band for a while.  Classics like &quot;Comfotsbly Numb&quot; transport me to a far-away island.  With one new track it is a great buy.
000649840X|5.0|Angelas Ashes written by Frank McCourt is probably the best book I have ever read. This book is the perfect example of how authors should tell stories. McCourt is so vivid in describing the scenery and this really makes the book what it is. He discribes the different conditions that their family lives in which really makes the reader feel as if they are there. McCourt was explaining the foul smell of most of the places they had once lived in and was constatly compairing it to the place they had lived in in America by saying how America never smelled as foul as Limerick. McCourt believes that people in America who are as poor as he is live like the wealthy people in Limerick. McCourt tells everyone in the novel that he will never again live like they do in Irland.This proves to the audience that his dream is to return to America and not live like those in his town. <BR> Another thing that really makes Angelas Ashes is the tragedy that Frank McCourt and his family over came, by lossing 3 kids to illness and their father to the drink. I have never encountered another author other that Elie Wisel (who wrote the novel Night) who had seemed so strong and as if there was nothing that would stop him from reaching hi dream, even after encountering so many obstacles. This gave me so much hope even though he McCourt had suffered so greatly it was so apairent that if he had not he would not have become what he became, and that is such an influencial leader and author. McCourt really gives those who fell that their life could not get any worse some hope in coming out on top. He proves the true drive that a person has when they a truly passionate about something.<BR> Finally Frank McCourts book really came alive with the roundness of every charcter. As opposed to not telling much about all his charcters except for himself McCourt gave indepth discriptions about each one of their personalities. Including his two dead brothers and one dead sister. He would spend pages explaining the looks in their eyes that led the reader to know much more about them.<BR>This is truly a great book that though has much sorrow also has a great message, and gives people hope in the common man. McCourt is truly very strong and has helped so many people understand the effects of a lack of father and overcoming extream tragedy. Those who have not read this book should read it and then rethink how they might be taking advantage of how they have been living.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It's sort of a Moses meets the Wizard of Oz!  I have always loved movies and books that take you on an adventure, and this one sure does. It carries the spirit of the classic good vs. evil.  The special effects are impressive even by todays standards, which is saying alot considering the fact that this film was made in the eightys!  I had seen Val Kilmer in other movies, but this is the one that made me a fan!  The characters are endearing, which helps to gloss over some of the less experienced actors performances.  The music that's played at the end of the movie is cool too!  It's the essence of the film to me.  It used to play on TV alot on the weekends, but I haven't seen it in so long.  I can't wait to have a copy of my own, so that I can watch it with my 4 year old little guy--and eventually with my baby girl!  Ron Howard tells a great story with this film...Thank you!
B00005OM4N|2.0|Britney's self-titled third album has been hyped by the media as one that expresses the older, more mature Britney.  Britney herself has proclaimed on MTV that she wrote almost every song on the album, when in fact she CO-WROTE only 5 of the album's 12 tracks.  So, does this album show Britney's growth from pop princess to mature songstress?  Let's just say she still has some work to do.<br />&quot;Britney&quot; is not a horrible album, but it will leave many of her die hard fans disappointed, especially those in their early adolescence.  Gone are the catchy, melodic tracks with infectious choruses like &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;, &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, and &quot;Stronger&quot;.  The first single is a clear indication of this.  &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; is perhaps the worst song on the album.  Why it was chosen to be the album's first single is a mystery.  Fortunately, this wasn't one of the Britney penned tunes.  The Neptunes are to blame for this bland, uninspiring track.<br />Fortunately, Britney was smart enough to continue to work with Max Martin on this album.  His catchy tunes from Britney's first two albums made her what she is today.  In fact, the only truly melodic songs on the album are those that were co-written by Martin.  These include &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella&quot;.  I'd like to say that the other Martin song, &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, is melodic as well, but it sounds like such a blatant rip-off of Britney's Pepsi commercial jingle that I just can't take it seriously.  The other three are certainly single material, though none can compete with the catchy singles from Britney's first two albums.  <br />Th rest of the album sounds like nothing more than filler material, which is pretty pathetic considering the entire 12 track album isn't quite 40 minutes in length.  Even Britney's cover of &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; sounds almost silly.  Talk about butchering a classic.  Britney may be gorgeous, but she can't belt out a hard rock anthem like Joan Jett.<br />The bottom line is that, if you're a hard core Britney fan, you're going to buy this album regardless of how many people tell you it's a disappointment.  However, if you're a fan of Britney's catchy, sing-along pop tunes, you are in for a major let-down.  While it's admirable for Britney to want to mature as a singer and express herself by writing her own songs, she could've done much better than this.  No matter how personal a song is to you, if it doesn't sound good to the listener it isn't worth putting it on an album.  As a Britney fan, I expected a lot more than I got.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but after two great pop albums I was hoping for some more classic melodies.  With a lack of truly standout single material and songs that won't be appealing to the millions of young fans who made Britney a superstar, it would be a miracle if this album were to come close to the successes of her previous two.  Still, Britney remains a great singer and dancer, and hopefully this will just be a forgettable album in a long and successful career for this young talent.
B00005OM4N|4.0|The new Britney album is by far her best!! Not only does it have the wonderful pop beats of Max Martin, it also has the hip-hop club feel of the Neptunes. By far the 2 best songs on this CD are #1 &quot;Slave&quot; and #5 &quot;Boys&quot; both tracks done by the Neptunes. Also the track #12 &quot;What Its Like to be Me&quot; was done by her georgeous dance instuctor Wade Robson and her even more georgeous boyfriend Justin Timberlake. Also another good track. I enjoy how she does a cover song on each of her CD's and &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; was an awesome cover. I was very dissapointed in song #6 and #11 almost way too much bubble gum pop, it took her back to &quot;...Baby one more time&quot; and it didn't follow her new emerging r&amp;b sound. all i have to say is the next CD have the neptunes do the entire thing and you will be money baby!!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I am usually pretty good with words, but right now I am almost speechless. This album is awesome. I'm not even a pop music fan. I just love Britney. This album is definitely a huge step for her. The lyrics are thought provoking (no, seriously) and the production is brilliant. If you're a Nsync fan, this album is probably NOT for you. This album is new and different. A friend of mine is a major punk fanatic and thoroughly enjoys this album. It's very edgy with a rock/r&amp;b feel. Don't knock Britney till you hear this album. because chances are, you'll be amazed.
0316776963|4.0|Sedaris manages to give us both a laugh-out-loud read and a wonderful portrait of a man and the way he relates to his world.  His characters are vivid (in particular his siblings, the Rooster and Amy). His stories are typically self deprecating with a hint of regret or sadness.  But he manages to keep it light, leaving you laughing the whole time.  The myriad of essay subjects manages to portray so many aspects of one person's life.<br />Since reading the book, everyone I run into who has already read it and I have spent time retelling the stories Sedaris tells.  This will not be the most intellectually challenging or deep book you read this year, but it might be the most fun!
B00005OWIU|5.0|First, I will say that I have read all of the HP books and am aware of all of the hype surrounding the upcoming movie. With that said, here goes my review of the soundtrack. It is the best movie soundtrack that I have ever heard. This soundtrack brings the HP world to life. I can envision scenes in the movie, without actually having seen it.<BR>The soundtrack is magical (of course!!), sad, exciting, scary and just plain makes you feel good. After listening to it, I was left with an emptiness...but then I realized, I could listen again!<BR>The soundtrack starts out with a prologue, which draws your attention and finishes strong.<BR>This transforms into the next track, &quot;Harry's Wonderous World&quot;, which builds up to many climactic points.<BR>Track 11, &quot;The Quiddich Match&quot;, is nothing short of incredible, as is, Track 17, &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot;, which is downright frightening!<BR>Other tracks, such as; &quot;Devil's Snare&quot;, &quot;The Chess Game&quot; and &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; (which was performed by John Williams live just a few months ago), are all memorable to the soundtrack.<BR>Williams pulls out all of the stops in this one to compose an absolutely invigorating peice. It will not disappoint. It is a must have to any serious music collector.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Absolutely the best NIN disc.  It is pure emotion... the music is aggressive and loud, screaming hate, while the lyrics speak of abysmal pain. I love every second!
B00005QDW5|4.0|Excellent comprehensive review of one of the most classic of classic rock bands, but of course even a two-disc retrospective isn't enough to hold the best of a group that regularly turn in 10-minute-plus masterpieces.  And it seems like most everything they've done that clocks in at over 10 minutes made the final roster for \\"Echoes\\".  Most of the band's more harder-rocking tracks (\\"Young Lust\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", \\"Have A Cigar\\") were left aside for some of the more etheral, stoner-friendly material, which is a shame.  I mean, how many people really know \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" and don't know \\"Young Lust\\"?  Anyway, here's the tracks that Disc THREE should have had (sorry, no Syd Barrett era stuff for me) - Have A Cigar, Goodbye Blue Sky, The Dogs Of War, Welcome To The Machine, Pigs (Three Different Ones), Lost For Words, One Slip, Mother, Not Now John, What Do You Want From Me, On The Turning Away, Empty Spaces/Young Lust, Take It Back, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage/Eclipse.
6302293553|5.0|one of the funniest movies ever!! From the shrubbery, to the European swallow, to the witch, to the coconuts, to Brave Sir Robin and his annoying minstrel, to the French guy, to Zoot and her friends...it's just a laugh a minute. Probably best for older kids cause younger kids wouldn't really get most of the jokes. Not inappropriate, though.
B0000507R0|5.0|THIS WAS THE FIRST LIVE CONCERT I EVER ATTENDED BACK IN DEC. 1973 AT THE MET SPORTS CTR. IN BLOOMINGTON MN.  HAVING BEEN AN ELP FAN FOR ONLY 2 YRS. AT THAT TIME, I WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY WERE AS GOOD AS THEIR ALBUMS.  THEY WEREN'T!!!  THEY WERE BETTER!!!!!  SINCE THAT CONCERT, I'VE HAD BRAIN SALAD SURGERY ON EVERY FORMAT AVAILABLE AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!  FOR THOSE WHO THINK THAT PROG ROCK PERFORMERS WERE &quot;PRETENTIOUS&quot; PERHAPS IT'S BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT MUSIC CAN BE MORE THAN JUST 3 CHORDS 2 TO 3 VERSES AND A CHORUS OR  &quot;SHALLOW/COMMON MUSIC&quot;.  PERHAPS THE CRITICS OF GROUPS SUCH AS ELP OR RICK WAKEMAN/YES SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM WHAT THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE AND EVALUATE WHAT THEY KNOW BEST THUS LEAVING THE &quot;MORE ADVANCED&quot; MUSIC TO THOSE WHO CAN APPRECIATE AND HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE MUSIC!!  IN SHORT, IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNTS OF WORK THAT GO INTO COMPOSITION, REHEARSAL, ARRANGING, EXPERIMENTATION AND PERFECTING WORKS OF MUSIC SUCH AS THIS (NOT JUST SIMPLE &quot;SHALLOW&quot; MUSIC), THIS COMPOSITION IN WHATEVER FORMAT, IS FOR YOU!!!
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney's new album is fresh,not much repetitivty and the songs are msotly all good. The cd may be a little short but that's okay, the poster and the movie footage make well up for it. If you want a cd you can listen to for a while go for this one, it's a real winner
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears, there has been so much written and said about the 19 year old pop star in the past couple of years that one would almost forget that she's a singer. Well more of an entertainer, that moniker would fit Britney a little better since she doesn't have the vocal range of counterpart Christina Aguilera. But Britney definently works with what she has. Sexy, stylized dance moves and hook filled pop ditties that don't require much from vocal chords but more from an image driven sex kitten (i.e. J.Lo &amp; Janet). Britney definently brings to mind predecessor Madonna, who used her sex appeal and hot tunes to claw her way to the top. Britney's 3rd album, &quot;BRITNEY&quot; is an excellent example of an artist wanting to outgrow an image and if the public won't allow the change gradually then the artist decides to force the issue. Britney sings a lot on this album about &quot;not being a little girl&quot; and wanting to feel sexy and doing what she does best....dance. With only 1 ballad track on the disc, Britney seems more determined than ever to carve her niche as a dance diva. This album does manage to have some good, stand alone tracks, like the dance club/top 40 radio ready &quot;Anticipating&quot; which borrows heavily from Janet Jackson's &quot;All For You&quot; except Britney's track seems lighter, less funky but just as danceable. &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, the 1st single released from BRITNEY is funk personnified, with Britney declaring &quot;just let me go and listen&quot;. Britney co-wrote several songs on the album and even though her material seems a bit cheesy, she's not expected to be Diane Warren or even Mariah Carey on her first time at bat. Some songs on the disc however do have the distinction of being solely album filler, like &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; which come off as being leftovers from previous recording sessions. And as she did previously with &quot;Can't Get No (Satisfaction)&quot;, Britney has churned out another horrid remake of a rock classic in &quot;I Love Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, Britney please give up this desire to redo beloved rock anthems into bubblegum rehashes for the Y generation, it doesn't become you. With &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; Britney again attempts to drive home her point of growing up but with the song being Britney's first AC radio ready ballad, it definently serves it purpose but theres no defining quality about the song which could have possibly fit the bill as Spears' signature song it might as well have been sung by Mandy Moore or Jessica Simpson.  But all in all Britney definently is showing growth as an artist, she is finally showing that maybe she's not a producer's puppet and with more fine tuning and time she'll progress into a solid pop artist just like her mentor Madonna.
0385505833|5.0|John Grisham exits nicely from the world of lawyers, courtrooms, and sleeze and takes us into a world all of us would recognize: What would happen if we passed on Christmas this year?<br />Protagonist Luther Krank (okay, the name is a bit to revealing), an accountant who knows the cost of Christmas but not its value, calculates an alternative to Christmas parties, unwanted gifts, illuminated Frosty's, and more. Why not simply say &quot;no&quot; to Christmas? &quot;No&quot; to the neighbors decorating their homes, to the Boy Scouts selling trees, to the policeman selling calendars, to medics selling fruitcakes...just say &quot;no&quot; to everyone and everything concerning Christmas. Take all that money you spend on mindless cards, trinkets, and parties and spend it on something half the cost and much less stressful, like a cruise. Perhaps the only sentiment stronger than the tempatation to pass on the anxiety, crass commercialism, drunken office parties and competitive neighborhood decorations must be the nostalgia we all have for Bing Crosby White Christmas past. The Kranks fight hard to stay the course.<br />A slim, fast read, it would be a shame to deter the prospective reader by revealing the plot twist but it is transparent and predictable. But it's also fun, and heartwarming. A nice Christmas gift.

0393316041|5.0|This is my favorite book.  Although it is considered to by a science book or possibly a biography, I consider it to be a combination of self-help and comedy.  The writing style is light, easy and extremely comical.  I could not put the book down. But to me, the book was mainly inspirational.  Here is a nobel prize winning physicist who tries nearly everything at least once.  He tried safe cracking, mind reading, learning languages, different technicals for meeting women, and living life fully through experimentation.  I now realize that there is another level that life can be lived.  I recommend this book to everyone I know.  It's entertaining, educational and good fun.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Yuck!  Every song in this album sounds like she's more concerned with the notes she's singing rather than what she is singing about.  There is no feeling anywhere in here.  I looked.  It's all about her voice which, albeit good, ruins every song by making it oh so terribly heavy.  Go get Jewel's Christmas CD...that's how it should be done.
0440539811|1.0|I tried to like this book (trilogy, whatever it is).  I normally like cult-ish books; Hitchhikers and Co., I don't usually mind if there is a splattering of violence, and a certain amount of sex, a la Ice and Fire by GRR Martin.  And I love a good mystery, conspiracy, etc.  BUT...I just couldn't finish this book.  Sure, it's meant to be confusing, I didn't have a problem with that, but hello!  keep the story going...all those story-detours for sex with apples and what-not...hmmm...I may finish it eventually. ;-p
B00005OM4N|1.0|Once again, Britney has unleashed her tedious muck upon the world.  No doubt every 9-12 year old girl with hormone problems will desire to own this one, plus its companions in the upcoming merchandising campaign.  At least it has educational value--At least this way, our young future women will know how to behave like (...).  I don't have any particular problem with Ms. Spears, and this is because my problem is with the music, which she has absolutely nothing to do with.  If there were actual instruments on her albums, they might be bearable, but they are merely an incessant cascade of bleeps and bloops and electronically synthesized mediocrity.
0446677450|4.0|I would never expect myself reading a book that talks about money,and business situations. I thought it was going to be hard to understand those books. I actually understood what Mr. Kiyosaki wath he was trying to said. I would recommend this book if you want to learn about being rich. This book made me stronger, and made me think of the real world.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Okay, this album is great.  I'll admit, until I heard &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; I didn't even really like Britney Spears.  I actually despised her.  But &quot;Slave&quot; was just a great song, and so I took a chance and bought the album.  Every song on this album is high quality.  You can literally sit through the entire thing and not skip a track, which for Britney is unusual since she usually likes to kill her albums with boring ballads.  Well this album hardly has any, and the ones it does have are pretty good.  Actually really good.  So in light of all this global chaos I'd really recommend buying this CD, because it just makes you feel good.
B00005OM4N|2.0|Although I liked the first single &quot;Im a slave for you&quot; for its freshness I have to say that Britney's 3rd album is disappointing.<BR>Most of the songs are lame. And unlike promised she did not write &quot;all the songs except 2&quot; only co-write 5 tracks.<BR>Contrary to her last album this one does not seem to have a theme that dominates it, it is more like a chaotic mix.<BR>The cover version of I love rocknroll is nice but not innovative at all.<BR>The songs  Overprotected, Cinderella and Let me be are funky though.<BR>But I don't think that's enough to save the album.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I would've gave this album 10 stars, if the system would let you, because this is the best work by Britney Spears, ever! ROCK ON!
B00005OM4N|4.0|The current queen of teen pop music delivers a new CD full of up-tempo, grown-up tunes. Tracks like \\"Boys\\" and \\"Anticipating\\" feature elements reminiscent of 1970's disco if that's your thing; or if you prefer \\"edgier\\" Britney, like on \\"Stronger\\" from her last release, then \\"Lonely\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" may be just for you. The leadoff track and single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 You\\" evokes memories of \\"Control\\"-era Janet Jackson, and the latest release (at the time of this review), \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,\\" may be the 19-year old diva's finest vocal performance yet. The cover of the Arrows' \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll,\\" best known as recorded by Joan Jett, is far superior to Miss Spears's earlier covers of Sonny & Cher and Rolling Stones classics. This sort of music isn't my thing; but I actually enjoyed this CD. (...)
B000002R48|5.0|I was into Dream Theater from their very first release -- When Dream and Day Unite -- because of a review I'd read in Britain's Kerrang! magazine.<br />Being a major progressive and melodic rock freak, I just had to seek out this album and listen to it.<br />I did. And I did. And it hooked me from the start.<br />I have a confession to make, however. I've tried and tried and tried to like James LaBrie's vocals and I just can't. LaBrie alternates between a melodramatic breathiness and a where's-the-note-I'm-looking-for histrionic that grates on my nerves. That's why, for my tastes, this debut featuring Charlie Dominici is the perfect blend of superb musicianship and soaring vocals.<br />That's why even though I've seen Dream Theater in concert a half dozen times and have all of their albums, I return again and again to this debut -- especially when I'm at the office, where I do most of my listening. It's the perfect blend of pleasant, yet powerful vocals and a level of musicianship that astounds to this day.<br />Granted, the guitar work is a bit pushed back in the mix. And it seems slanted more toward the keyboards than it could have been. But each song is great. Very upbeat and driving. Particularly the last track, \\"Only a Matter of Time.\\" I put that on Repeat on my CD player at the office and use it to inspire my copywriting.<br />Other stand-out tracks include the now-classic \\"Ytse Jam\\" and \\"Light Fuse and Get Away.\\"<br />DT has come a long way since this debut release. They've literally become a world-wide phenomenon, revered by fans and critics alike. And held in highest regard by fellow musicians who consider them to be demi-gods. (Drummer Mike Portnoy has become one of today's most lauded musicians, appearing in not one but two noteworthy side projects: Liquid Tension Experiment and TransAtlantic. Both highly recommended.)<br />Even though they're superstars now, with a string of incredible albums under their belts, I'll always return to When Dream and Day Unite for the sheer enjoyment of hearing a band that started with a bang -- and just kept getting better.
0446525537|5.0|I have recently read &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; by Nicholas Sparks. I found this book ejoyable for most ages(im in 7th grade) and I enjoyed it alot.

This is truly a 5 Star grade A book!!
B00005OM4N|3.0|First impression: with this third cd Britney finally changed direction a bit and went for a slightly more grown up sound/image. I do not own her previous albums, in fact I haven't even heard them, but based on singles like &quot;Baby, one more time&quot;, &quot;Ooops...&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot; I can only conclude that they must have sounded quite similar (read: boring after one or two songs). Good thing she decided to work with different writers and producers this time, instead of relying fully on the hit-making-potential of Swedish collaborators Martin &amp; Rami. The best songs on this album are without a doubt &quot;I'm a slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot;, both written and produced by The Neptunes, who also worked with MJ Blige on her latest album (btw, also a must have!). Both songs are sexy as hell and absolute dance toppers! &quot;Anticipating&quot; reminds of Janet's &quot;Go Deep&quot; and is perfect as a pre-partying, getting-in the-mood-for-dancing type of song. &quot;What's it like to be me&quot; (co-written by J. Timberlake)is very similar to 'N Sync's &quot;Pop&quot;. It's a great pop song with an edge. &quot;Lonely&quot; and &quot;Let me be&quot; are ok, but not exceptional. The ballads are, as usual (why don't pop artist just stick to what they're good at?), the same old same old, even with the cooperation of British up-and-coming star Dido. Conclusion: if you're not a Britney fan don't buy the album, you'll hate it. If you are a fan you'll be happy to hear that she's progressed since the last two albums. The majority of the tracks are still dance tracks, but edgier, raunchier even, though never exaggerated. If she could now just loose the kiddie dance songs from the Swedish duo and work a bit more on the ballads, she might be on her way to become the Madonna of the 21st century.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Our little Britney is growing up.  She's getting older, wiser, better looking... and in keeping with the old adage, &quot;the third time is a charm&quot;, Ms. Spears has delivered an album without a single solitary weak filler track on it. <br />Her first two albums, ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again, guilty pleasures that they were, had their fair share of filler (could the most diehard devoted Britney mark ever bear to listen to &quot;E-Mail My Heart&quot; all the way through again?) and some rather savage manglings of cover material (like the version of the Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; that made Rage Against The Machine's bass player climb the walls at last year's MTV Video Awards, and the cover of Sonny &amp; Cher's &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; that closed her first album). <br />Gone are those days.  Gone are most of the composers and producers on her first two albums, save for the redoubtable Max Martin &amp; Remi (the Swedish duo responsible for most of her singles) and R&amp;B heavyweight Rodney Jenkins (even though he produced Brit's cover of &quot;Satisfaction&quot;).  Helping Britney on her quest to not screw around in the studio making halfhearted filler tracks are hip-hop producer/multi-instrumental team The Neptunes, and the team of Brian Kieruff &amp; Josh Schwartz, who make a more prominent contribution to Britney not as producers, but as her songwriting collaborators.  Yes, collaborators - inspired by her boyfriend Justin Timberlake (of *NSync, who chips in a songwriting and producing contribution of his own with partner Wade Robson), and having warmed up her own pen with a track on Oops!..., our little Britney co-wrote five of the album's twelve tracks. <br />Gone is the sugary pop that once suited the young virginal, never been kissed Britney.  Instead, young adult Britney puts on her best husky alto for the TLC-esque &quot;Boys&quot; and the Prince-influenced &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, brings in funk legend Nile Rodgers to contribute his classic guitar stylings to the disco/soul-meets-Daft Punk &quot;Anticipating&quot;, and delivers a remake of Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock 'N' Roll&quot; that pretty much erases the sour aftertaste &quot;Satisfaction&quot; left in people's mouths last year.   Other tracks like &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot;, while initially recalling earlier Britney classics like &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot;, reinforce Britney's current maturity rather than drag her back into the past. <br />If &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; is only one part of Britney's new mission statement, &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; is the other.  The only actual ballad on the entire album and a song co-written by Dido (yes, that Dido, as in &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Stan&quot;), &quot;I'm Not A Girl...&quot; perfectly reflects the current milestone the 19-year-old singer is currently at. <br />If her music was a closet favorite of yours before, Britney will bring you out of the closet.  If you were already an unashamed fan of hers, you'll no doubt remain a fan of hers for life. Either way, this disc will probably find its way into your stereo more than her first two albums did. <br />Britney Spears has made no secret of her admiration of Madonna, and her desire to have a career as durable and memorable as the Material Girl's.  Britney, the album, may just be the album that helps Ms. Spears. on that journey, and if she keeps putting out material as good as what's on this release, she won't have any problem achieving that goal.
0553577123|5.0|Anne Frank may well have become a successful author had her life not been cut tragically short.  She is remarkably clear and effective in communicating an emotional sense of what it was like, at least from her point of view, to live an extended period in a severely restrictive environment.  Anne's optimism and faith rings clear without being expressly stated.  It is refreshing in that there is no hint of contrived drama or melodrama in her descriptions of everyday life suffused with internal and external stresses.  This book reads as honest, direct and true as life gets.<br />This book is the literal diary of a Jewish teen hiding from the Nazis in Holland during World War Two.  It covers the period in Anne's life from about thirteen to fifteen years old.  She lives on the top floor of a warehouse with her immediate family (mother, father, and sister) as well as another family of three (the &quot;Van Daan's&quot; and their sixteen year old son) and an older dentist with whom she must share a room.  The antics, conflicts and daily travails amidst food shortages, break-ins and a seemingly endless parade of small crises test the limits of the residents of the annex.  One of the more revealing episodes involves a brief fling at romance with the sixteen-year-old son of the Van Daan's and Anne.  It is a revealing look at adolescence and the process of maturity through a tightly focused lens. It is truly wrenching as you learn the fate of each of the residents.  One is left with an unforgettable snapshot of humanity, its courage and its failings, in a time of deep crisis and almost unbelievable tragedy.<br />The Diary of Anne Frank is often taught at the middle school level.  My sixth grade students expressed interest in the book, so I let them read as part of their reading curriculum.  I found that while most had little trouble understanding the book (they were above average readers) they were too young to really grasp and appreciate the subtle, and sometimes not so subtle themes running through the book.  They had no emotional sense of what these people's daily lives were like.  There was nothing in their limited life experience to help them appreciate or understand what living in such conditions for an extended period would be like.  Anne Frank would be better read at the high school level, or better yet, as a book read by choice.<br />A note on this edition:  The Definitive edition includes much material that was excised from the original diary.  Many of Anne's comments about her mother were less than flattering, and so her father (the only survivor in the book) sought to protect the memory of his wife.  This is certainly understandable, but the Definitive edition more honestly reflects Anne's feelings at the time.  I don't think there's too many people that would begrudge a teenager's rejection of their parents.  It's only sad that she didn't live long enough to come through and see her mom through the eyes of an adult.themes running through the book.

B00005QDW5|3.0|Throughout its thirty year career, Pink Floyd was a band marred by conflict among its members over differences in creative vision. No less then three &quot;incarnations&quot; of Pink Floyd have existed, in effect three different bands each lead by one dominating personality. Given the amount of creative variance the band experienced from year to year, and indeed from album to album, one has to question the validity of a &quot;Best of&quot; album - other than, in Waters' words, &quot;to scrape the bottom of the barrel for more dollar bills.&quot; Is it possible to capture the spirit of Pink Floyd with one compilation?<BR>Well, yes and no. The most successful albums Floyd has released in its career were concept albums (an album in which the music is centered around a unifying theme, for those of you born in the Britney generation). Thus, they are best appreciated as a whole, and in fact individual songs are less enjoyed and even understood when listened to out of context. Listeners who are not familiar with the Orwellian theme of &quot;Animals&quot; will likely find &quot;Sheep&quot; a little confusing, for example. Songs like &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; from 1983's &quot;The Final Cut&quot; will make even less sense. Worse still, a whopping 4 albums are ignored completely - &quot;More&quot;, &quot;Ummugumma&quot;, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, and &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; all of which were recorded during the band's progressive rock experimentation phase. Moreover, the songs themselves are presented in more or less random order, which prevents the new listener from hearing the creative evolution of the band, from it's genesis as a psychedelic pop band, to it's death as a soft rock dinosaur. Instead, tracks are criminally intertwined without regard to the fact that, in some cases, they were written 25 years apart. In the end, listeners will no doubt be left wondering: which one's Pink?<BR>It's unfortunate that fans continue to be fed this kind of nostalgic tripe when so much more Pink Floyd material exists out there - notably, Floyd's BBC Sessions, unreleased film scores, and rare live recordings. Still, this reviewer hopes that &quot;Echoes&quot; may bring new fans to the fold, and in turn lend them a deeper appreciation of this outstanding band.
B00005LOUS|2.0|Jim Carrey is amusing for only about a minute but after that, I can't stand him. Kids will probably get a kick out of Carrey's antics and his constant mugging for the camera. I for one will always be a fan of the original Chuck Jones cartoon with Boris Karloff's memorable narration. Making a live action film from a cartoon CAN be worthwhile, but this one didn't work for me.
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl is the autobiography of a young woman coming to terms with adolescence while hiding from the Nazis with other Jewish citizens throughout the early 1940s.  The novel is made up of the fascinating diary of the fourteen year-old (Anne Frank), and takes the reader on a journey through her deepest ideas and thoughts on the every-day trials and tribulations of life throughout a most painstakingly difficult period in the 20th Century.  Anne begins the story as a carefree schoolgirl and ends it as a wise and experienced young adult, giving the reader a sense of Annes remarkable character while living under the most fearfully uncomfortable conditions.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and after finishing it I have learned a lot about myself in the process.  This is because, in Annes continual fight with her own emotions and feelings, (and tiring struggle to stay true to herself), I began to challenge myself with questions about the strengths and weaknesses of my own character.  Since Anne's greatest quality is her awareness of her own self and her ability to know when she is being fair and when she being unreasonable, she also possesses the unique ability to reflect on these things with a profound sense of truth.  This admirable discipline of ones own conscience and clear, determined course of thought is something I wish I had, but I feel I have become more aware of this near the end of the book.<br />  (***)  Through analyzing Anne's entries to \\"Kitty\\" (Annes imaginary name of whom she writes to in her diary) I have become a little more compassionate and understanding, because I realize how important it is to be thankful for life.  So often I waste my time complaining about things, and little do I understand how well off I am in the big picture of the world.  Annes positive outlook and noble courage has inspired me to become more optimistic, and as an exceptionally bright 15 year-old she serves as a great role model for the youth of our generation.  I most definitely recommend this novel for mature teenage girls, it is most appropriate for 14 years of age and up.he youth of our generation.

B00005QDW5|5.0|This is a great collection of songs.  I own two Pink Floyd albums &quot;The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn&quot;(their first) and &quot;The Final Cut&quot;(IMO their last).  Though this compilation has songs from the two post-final cut albums- they don't really detract from the overall sound.  The CD is sequenced very well and the remastering is a plus.  As an introduction, there couldn't be a better, balanced choice.  Everybody has their favorite album.  A good portion of the population will cling to their copy of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon.&quot; This compilation has made me remember how great the individual albums are, and maybe- just maybe I'll purchase the albums as money presents itself to me. But for now, I have this great 2-disc teaser of interesting songs- maybe not as challenging as Radiohead- but more melodic. And just one more thing- Syd Barrett &amp; Roger Waters Rule!!!(and neither are in Pink Floyd as it exists right now, but you all probably already knew that)
0380973650|5.0|I have read several of Gaiman's works, and this one rates with his others as being one of the best I've read.  With characters that you remember, and plot twists that come at you from no where, I routinly stayed up till past dawn reading this book.  Even the ending after the climax had a few twists left in it.  I recomend this book, as I believe you will truely enjoy it.  If you don't have a more open minded view of things however, I wouldn't sugest it.  The most importent thing is to loose oneself in the story, and this one almost drags you kicking and screaming into it.  A true Gaiman classic.

B00005RHGK|4.0|This movie has to be the most infuriating films in existence. I went in not expecting much...just a boring but hopefully enjoyably bad horror flick. However, as the first half of the film unravels you realise two things....<br />1. this guys seen far too much texas chainsaw massacre and has decided to rip off huge chunks of it mood, story, and enviroment.<BR>2. you have to forgive him cause he's somehow managing to do it all in an equally frightening and yet enjoyable way that doesn't seem to be able to do wrong. and is actually far scarier than texas chainsaw....<br />you see...in the first half of the movie we have a gradual build up of events...but no too gradual and not too slow. we have genuinely scary as hell moments that almost make you want to turn away from the screen in disgust/terror...but not over the top or overtly disgusting. we have two kids out in the middle of nowhere with a figure hunting them down. but it's all well handled and extremely effective as the writer/director manages to pile on suprise after suprise. the seen with the killer on the roof of the police car has to be seen to be believed! <br />however...then comes the second reel of the film, and without giving anything away (let's just say that if i explain what the killer is then the first half probably won't seem scary anymore) we end up with an increasingly cheesy movie that looks akin to a stephen king tv movie. yep..bits are that bad.<BR>the ideas are still there and some of them are quite superb. even the final explanation of the killer and why everythings happenning manages to almost be a fairly haunting idea. but the fact is it show too much and with the modest budget it has-it just cant handle the second reel. hell, even with a larger budget they simply should of stayed with the way the story is originally going and built upon it.<br />i've tried not to sound too harsh here as this really is (in its greater moments) one of the finest horror movies i've seen in a long long long time. and if nothing else its a wonderfully refreshing change from the post-modern humour driven adventures of the scream type films. nothing against them or anyhting, but we need to get back to some of the roots of horror films, and remember that not all killers stalk babysitters in the suburbs.<br />if you like jeepers creepers then you must of course see the texas chainsaw massacre. and even duel. and just as i have an excuse to do it..go watch the original evil dead again...to remember how its all done right.

0345413377|5.0|I am personally amazed to read some of the reviews of people saying how they did not enjoy this book. The Amber Spyglass is one of those rare books these days that you cannot put down. From the first page to the last it is filled with everything that readers of Philip Pullman's other two novels in this series have come to expect and enjoy, such as the sly way Mrs. Coulter always get things done(later in the book he shows a rather surprising and unexpected aspect of her personality), Lyra and her almost innocent and yet grown up way of looking at all she encounters, and Will and his strength to do what needs to be done. Other characters also make a return apperance such as the witch Serafina Pekkala, Lord Asriel, Iorek Brynison, Mary Malone, and perhaps a few that no one would expect to be able to make a return. <br />Pullman does make many world changes in this book, and introduces new characters, new creatures while further explaining both Lyra's and Will's destinies as well as those of everyone that they have encountered in a very pleasing and clean manner that should me very satisified. I was however saddened by the ending, perhaps in part because of part of what was required to make this ending as clean and a wonderful as it was and perhaps because it is the end of the series and the adventures of Will and Lyra have been cleanly ended within this novel. Overall it was a very excellent if not somewhat abrupt end to the series.  <br />What helps make The Amber Spyglass so special and unique are the challenges that Will and Lyra face throughout the book, including perhaps the hardest challenge they or anyone would ever have to face near the end. These challenges take many forms, and help the characters to explore more about both themselves and each other. They learn some of the secerts of the witches, and more both about Dust and Lord Asriel's 'war.' I can truly say that it is possible to see the very last choice that is almost forced on Will and Lyra to be sad forboth of them and yet in a way happy for seeing them make the difficult choice they have to make. <br />I have no hesitation in saying that in this book much as in the others it is the very challenges and the familiar topics, such as Dust, the Oblation Board, and the idea of the many worlds that are linked through the doorways that were shown to exist in The Subtle Knife, which help to make this book the  one that you cannot put down once you have started reading Chapter One. <br />Personally, I have only one regret about this book and that is the way in which it was ended leaves little chance for Pullman to take an chance and bring these characters back in another book. The ending does leave the option, but it is a small one. Overall I highly recommend this book and if you are unsure after reading some of the reviews that say otherwise about this book, I simply encourage you to read it and choose for yourself which type of book you believe it to be. Though personally I feel that you will find as I have Philip Pullman helps to make this as good as the The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, and perhaps the best in the His Dark Materials Series.
B00004Y62T|4.0|In a way, I liked it. A careful elaboration of the character of an accomplished evil, an exploration how deep the vice and the greed can lead.
059035342X|2.0|I've debated writing this review for some time now, but at last I think I can summarize what my thoughts are on this book. Be forewarned beforehand that I'm a Christian (Oh no! One of them! *crowd hisses*), but don't let that fool ya, I'm actually a decent guy. <br />I don't know when this book was written, but what I do know is that the media has innundated us with it. You know what I'm talking about...Harry Potter books, t-shirts, puzzles, toys, lunchboxes, and more paraphenilia than you can shake a broomstick at. This I think is amplified when you have Jerry Falwell banging on a podium (where 99% of the rest of we Christians hold our collective breaths and hope he doesn't say something embarrassing) and calling it evil. After well over a year of seeing this constant deluge of &quot;Harry Potter is sooooo wonderful!&quot; hooplah, I finally gave in and grabbed my niece's copy of it, and sat down one weekend to see what all the fuss was about. <br />At the end of the weekend I looked up from the last page and thought to myself, &quot;Did I miss something?&quot;. That was the experience for me...I walked away from it one single word on my mind. Hype. Now before I'm accused of being a closed-minded witch hater, there's a few things here that should be cleared up before some of the fans here burn me at the stake. <br />The plot is a bit hazy at times. It gels up at small certain times throughout the book, but never really solidifies until the end. This isn't to say JK Rowling is a bad author (or authoress, if you will)...there are times within the book where her talent really shines through. She, to me, has a special gift for describing places and people especially, making images of them come to mind without effort. But let's face it...the people within the book are pure stereotype. The kids are either all good or evil, no in between whatsoever, and the adults are just plain inept. And to the chagrin of all the fans here, let me say I didn't really much care for the character of Harry Potter himself. There is no stoic character there, just a mouthy one who, in my humble opinion, goes looking for trouble. I liked Ron best of the children, just a good all round kid, followed by Hermione, much the same. But I never did quite get a good connection with any of the others to be honest. <br />The &quot;adults&quot; running the school, including the headmaster, are portrayed for the most part as simpletons, unaware of some of the most blatant activities taking part practically right in front of them. <br />Before I get lambasted, I understand this is a children's book. I went into this thing with an open mind, expecting a really gripping story and plentiful visualizing. But the book was only partially successful in this to me. I'd sooner recommend the Narnia series or Lord of the Rings, but there seems to be a large enough CS Lewis vs. JK Rowling slugfest going on as it is.<br />And before I cease my diatribe, I'll shortly explain that the reason that the average Christian doesn't recommend this book is because it's forbidden for us (and Jews as well) to dabble in the black arts. That's generally accepted as the domain of &quot;the other guy&quot;, and so witchcraft is chronically avoided. So when a book or series of books comes out that candy coats the subject, making it more palatable for young minds (and more than a few parents), we instantly go on our guard. Bear in mind that 99% of us don't think Teletubbies or Barney are evil. Just annoying. ;)<br />It's not personal against anyone who reads and likes this book or the remainder of the series. My niece tells me that of the 4 released books, this is probably the most non-thrilling one, and proclaims that the next 2 are the best. But after this I just don't have the desire to read anymore of them. Thanks for your time :)
6303965415|5.0|A brilliant, compelling production.  The designers chose to use a bleached-looking color scheme to keep everything pointing back to the sea, from whence Captain Wentworth returns.  Fabulous performance by Sophie Thompson as Anne's petulant sister, Mary.

If you need a label, this is art rock with classical influences and fantastic, imaginative lyrics [and artwork by the great Roger Dean on the cover]. 'Roundabout' is the most familiar track and typifies the four major pieces. The shorter interludes are in no way 'filler'. To me, Fragile should be enjoyed as whole, I love it from start to finish.
B000002UB3|5.0|Since the band's inception, everyone and their mother has praised the Beatles, from Please Please Me to Let It Be. So what makes Abbey Road so much better than, say, Sgt. Pepper? Each Beatle (yes, even Ringo) had a moment on the album in which they prove themselves to be great artists, writers and musicians. The band's previous albums all had themes and myths about them which caused people to say &quot;The Beatles are great!&quot; when in fact, the bulk of the prize work was being done by Lennon and McCartney. <br />So when listeners arrive at Abbey Road in their Beatles collection, they are actually being presented with THE Beatles, as in the four musicians who made up the band, and who were all capable of great work.  Even with the band on the verge of the now infamous split, Lennon, McCartney and Harrison all contributed standout tracks that recorded how gifted they were aside from the huge Beatle myth. And Ringo forshadowed the success of his solo career with his lovable kid's anthem, &quot;Octopuses' Garden&quot;.  Lennon cemented his role as the cool, confused, die-hard rock n' roller with &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;She's So Heavy&quot;, and &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard / Polythene Pam&quot;.  <br />Naturally, Paul delivered with the extreme Fats Dominoish <BR>&quot;Oh! Darlin&quot;, and the entire &quot;Golden Slumbers Medley&quot;.  And of course, he threw in the atypical silly McCartney song, &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;. Harrison continued to come into his own with the legendary and beautiful song, &quot;Something&quot;, and the optimistic &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;.  Also on display on the album is the skill he had achieved on guitar; as the band developed, Harrison went from a just-getting-by lead guitarist to one that was capable of understated mastery. <br />And in the end.....this is an album you have to own.  It was the Beatles taking their first step into their solo careers, while pausing one last time to record the magic they had as bandmates. Surely they could have all written these songs as solo artists, but the love they shared for each other pushed the songs into another stratosphere.
B0000021RD|5.0|Well worth having just for the 'Make Me Smile' suite, an ambitious and varied piece with classical influences. The contrasting rocker '25 or 6 to 4'  is also brilliant featuring one of the best  guitar solos ever. A stunnng effort throughout, instrumentally and lyrically. One of my very favourite albums, it has a timeless beauty.
0451191153|5.0|This novel is a masterpiece. Ayn Rand, who was born Alice Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1904, wrote captivating dialogical novels every bit as detailed and interwoven as the novels by Dostoevsky--though significantly more affirmative.  <br /> <br />She constructed her characters in a similar manner to the way in which Victor Hugo constructed the characters of his novels; that is, she created a smorgasbord of characters representative of different ideals whereby each one consciously and/or subconsciously acts in accordance with a specific philosophy and sense of life.  <br /> <br />As in real life, some of her characters vacillate between contradictory principles. Her main characters, however, are \\"ideal\\" types. In the course of the narrative they are brought together in situations in which their integrity is tested.  <br /> <br />This novel demonstrates how some people gauge their self-worth according to how others view them. Some rely on the evaluation of the opaque ubiquitous majority; some feel they need to subordinate others to themselves. Only the protagonist, Howard Roark, does not assess his self-worth and the meaning of his person according to how others evaluate him. He is the self-reliant individual.  <br /> <br />This is a novel of ideas in which their concrete implications are demonstrated in the actions of the characters. For those who believe that ideas have no consequences (psychological, social, economic, and political), this novel will not register. Those who understand otherwise, who seek and are self-creative, may find in this novel a treasure trove and a companion.  Those whose souls are set ablaze by all that relates to the human spirit may find inspiration in this book. <br /> <br />
B000007PSR|1.0|I wanted to like this but I didn't. It seems to be out-takes of songs that weren't good enough for Floyd or his other albums. One for the hardcore Floyd fans perhaps? Guess I don't qualify!
B00003CXBK|5.0|There's just something about that Japanese movie styling, isn't there?  Remember G-Force?  This is a great story, if a little violent for kids, maybe.  No brainer -- add it to your collection.
B00005QATY|5.0|This movie is now one of my top two favorites of all time. Offbeat (the story, not the music) and quirky, this movie is not much like anything you may have seen, and that is what makes it a real treasure. A great cast, a soundtrack that stays in your mind and keeps your toes tapping, and a fun 'old-timey' feel to it, it's one to see more than once, if for no other reason than to listen to George Clooney rattle off his multi-syllabic nonsense. The reviewers may have trashed it, but who listens to them anyway?
B00005OAJ1|5.0|this album rocks! although i like it when its just jack black and kyle gass with their acoustic guitars, the songs still rock and  dave grohl's drumming is a bonus. the skits are hilarious and jack black seriously has one of the best rock voices around. get it to add some real juice to your cd collection and if you wanna laugh out loud.
0812550706|5.0|I am always suspicious when someone tells me a book is one of the best ever written. I think that stems from reading all of those &quot;classic&quot; books in school and having it reiterated year after year that each represents one of the best stories ever created. Many of you have probably experienced the same kind of letdown when reading those kinds of books. <br />That disappointing experience did not take place after I read this novel. I don't know about anyone one else, but when I read a great story, I always feel blessed to have been touched by creative genius. The blessing really rained down with this book!<br />In this story, Orson Scott Card explains piece-by-piece, detail-by-detail, why events happen and how decisions are made. He provides the psychology involved in even the most mundane actions or thoughts. This may sound boring to some, but if you like investigative/forensic TV shows and novels, then you have the mindset to fall in love with Ender's Game. <br />In an age when couples must be granted permission to have children and having more than one is rare, Andrew Wiggin is the third child born to his parents. Rather than this being a blessing or even just another birth, Andrew's birth is seen as a disgrace by society. NO ONE is irresponsible enough to bring three kids into the world. Hence the terrible nickname &quot;Ender&quot; meaning the &quot;last and least one&quot;. <br />Our hero is a 10 year old stategic boy genius who has been chosen to join an elite, intergalactic Battle School. There, he is expected to be a part of the battalion that will eventually engage Earth's enemy, the Buggers. All of the students of Battle School are children. Why? Because the Buggers (an insect-like species), are light years away. The school is in space and traveling toward the Buggers' homeworld. At their present speed, any adult who joined the school would be too old to fight once they encountered their enemy. So if they are so far away, why go to them? Earth hasbeen attacked twice and devastated by the Buggers. It has been decided to take the war to them so that, if the fleet looses, the people of Earth will have a little more time to prepare a defense.<br />Although Ender is a genius, he is an outcast. He receives little respect at home or at Battle School. So, before he can use his talents to defeat the Buggers, he must first survive against his enemies on Earth and in school. <br />There is more than one story taking place in this novel. In fact, this book could have been entitled &quot;Wiggin's Game&quot;, because Ender isn't the only member of his family with formidable intellectual and strategic skill. Both his brother and sister were almost chosen for Battle School, but were deemed unsuitable. They are apparently not unsuitable to literally vie for leadership on Earth, even though they are only children! How can they do it? Read the book.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Even though she is insisting in that she has grown up and that &quot;I Am Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, Britney Spears has not grown up musically or vocally in any sense. &quot;Britney&quot; sounds pretty similar to her previous album &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot;, it has lots of fun to listen upbeat pop tracks like the first single &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;, &quot;Overprotected&quot;, &quot;Lonely&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; and one or two ballads. I'm not saying I don't like the album, if I didn't I would not have given it 4 stars. It is cool to listen and the lyrics are catchy, what a good pop album is supposed to have. But if you think you are going to find a &quot;mature&quot; or deeper Britney, look somewhere else cause you won't find it here.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Frankly, I'm a little sick of everyone picking on this album just because it does not sound the same as their previous endeavors.  How can a band be expected to produce the same record over and over again?<br />That said, this album is by far one of the best I own.  Morning view is a blend of incredible lyrics, beautiful melodies, and overall intelligent music.  A good balance between hard and soft exists on the CD.  Circles, Blood on the Ground, Have you Ever, and Under my Umbrella are the hard songs on the album.  They feature loud guitars and biting lyrics, and they manage to get their point across eloquently and without profanity.  It's refreshing to hear a change from the limp-bizkit-rap-core-metal that seems to be invading today's music scene.  Nice to Know You and Warning are a mix of hard and soft, and again, get straight to the point.  Are you In is a funky song that completes the record's wide range of genres.  The soft songs, such as Wish you were Here, Just a Phase, 11:00 AM, Echo, and Aqueous Transmission are not soft because Incubus is selling out, they are soft because the songs are not about angry things.  It wouldn't make sense to write a hard-rock song about something that isn't, well, hard-rock.  Just because the songs aren't as loud doesn't lessen their value.  They are artistically and musically as sound and as beautiful as the rest of the songs on the album.  Overall, I'm proud to say I own and love Incubus' Morning View, one of the strongest collections of music on the shelves today.
B000002J1M|5.0|In AFoxtrot<br />In American Psycho, unhinged killer Patrick Bateman loves Genesis. But dismisses the band's early work as far too clever and intellectual, preferring the chart-topping soul/pap they put out later. This is, of course, a good way of saying that early Genesis has all the artistic merit and late the 80s stuff is as emotionally and spiritually bereft as he is. That's not to say, however that Foxtrot will be in everybody's taste - 70s symphonic rock is still officially a dirty word - but it is a landmark album of that genre and I love it! It has Supper's Ready, a towering, 20-minute epic of sheer genius and showcases the band at its most innovative and inspired. The lyrics alone, penned by Peter Gabriel, are a fountain of references and allusions, and are at once humorous, satirical, soulful and serious. Behind them, meanwhile, the music soars, dips and struts its way towards the majestic finale. The other tracks, Watcher of the Skies, an up-tempo rocker with its now-classic Mellotron intro;  the up-tempo Get `Em Out by Friday where Gabriel acts out an array of different characters; and the acoustic Can-Utility and the Coastliners, which is one of my all-time favourites and the kind of thing that makes me wish it was 1972 again.<br />A great album which, when the progressive rock revival starts, will be on everybody's lips, or at least in their CD players.
B000002LCK|5.0|The word \\"essential\\" has been used to describe just about every CD available for sale on Amazon by one reviewer or another, but if any album deserves this description its Substance 1987 by New Order.<br /><br />During the 80's, New Order crafted a unique and wonderful sound combining the fretty guitar work and almost-spoken vocals of Bernard Sumner, the absolutely wicked, high range lead bass guitar playing of Peter Hook, Stephen Morris's near-machine like drumming, and Gillian Gilbert's swirling keyboards.<br /><br />Danceable, introspective, almost despondent, New Order somehow created brilliant, emotional songs through vocals and instrumental playing almost entirely lacking in any emotion, and, in so doing, laid the groundwork for much of today's dance music.<br />No one who appreciates wonderful music, then, should allow themselves to be unfamiliar with New Order, which is why this CD is a perfect purchase as it includes all of their best work.<br /><br />  Everything is here - the brilliantly written Ceremony (\\"Note for whom wheels are turning / Turn again and turn towards this time....\\"), the drug induced lyrics of Temptation (\\"Oh, you've got green eyes / Oh, you've got blue eyes, Oh, you've got grey eyes...\\"), the infamous, detached Blue Monday who's drum machine created beat sounds only slightly less machine-like than Bernard Sumner's vocals on the same, The Perfect Kiss, a beautiful, complicated multi-layered song combining just about every element of New Order's sound, the classic Bizarre Love Triangle (\\"Every time I see you falling / I get down on my knees and pray\\") and the sublime True Faith (\\"I used to to think that the day would never come / I'd see the light in the face of the morning sun...\\")<br /><br />And that's just disc 1.  Disc 2 has the b-sides from the above songs.  About half of the b-sides from these tracks are instrumental / dub versions of the a-sides on disc 1 - a few are actually improvements on the a-sides, while about half the tracksare original b-sides.  The standout track here is \\"1963\\", later released as a single, an emotive take on Marilyn Monroe's relationship with JFK (\\"Johny, don't point that gun at me / there's so many ways our lives have changed / but please I beg don't do this to me\\").<br /><br />In short, this is album contains all of the best work by the band that is, in my humble opinion, probably the greatest band to come along in the last 20 years, so buy it, buy it with confidence knowing that you can't go wrong here, and buy it now - you won't regret it.
B000005JA8|1.0|OK.. Through the years of my youth I heard so much about Captain Beefheart. When I was young it was hard to get his discs but I finally was able to get SAFE AS MILK. Eh... it didn't thrill me. Delta blues with a bad band and a bad voice. However, since I was a Zappa fan I knew Frank produced TROUT MASK and I read that it was in Rolling Stones Top 100 albums (this was in the early 80's when the journalism in Rolling Stone was credible and not the tripe it is today) I felt it would be worth getting. After seacrhing high &amp; low I found it - and boy was I disappointed. It was unlistenable. To me it was a mess!!! It was painful. But I don't want to totally write it off because it does have an artsy-fartsy appeal to it and some listeners may dig Beefhearts odd poetry and the bad musicianship. I didn't dig it, but you may if you like stuff that's really out there.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I think Paramount did a good job with this special edition. I looked foward to watching Star Trek with a commentary. It's filled with goodies that I recommend to any trek fan. All star Trek fans would really go for this.
B000002LE6|5.0|Prince is like a precious, multi-faceted stone to me.  On this album he covers God, love and sex in a way that only Prince can.  It hurts me that most people are too fickle to grow with an artist.  Prince is growing on this one and it's a fabulous experience if you go along with him.  I like that the album is one continuous track, which forces the superficial people to listen to the CD in its entirety whether they want to or not.  Prince did it this way for a reason.  Obviously, he has something he wants, needs you to hear.  So, get it, listen to it and grow a little or a lot, but grow nevertheless.
0553573403|1.0|NEVER listen to reviewers, how does it go?  &quot;5 star may equal to less than expected?&quot;  Waste of time, space and money.  Another cash-cow combo series, just like his predecessor, Robert Jordan; Martin crams five books in his first, and tries to sound intelligent by &quot;being creative with enthralling characters and plot&quot;.<br />The characters are dull, and worse yet, you are thrusted upon the Stark family, and supposed to like their bland, unoriginal personalities== a typical midieval King in my mind.  Then, before Martin has given the audience a chance to enjoy them, he kills them.<br />All of these characters have flashes of personality,the only ones worth a bean of liking is: John being the non-blood child, and the youngest(pardon me for forgetting her name) having a yearning for something else--but for the most part, there is nothing much to behold.<br />On plot:  He drags you instantly into the novel, trying to make you care for his kingdom with typical and predictable plot lines that seem thoughtlessly written. He doesn't give the audience enough time to become enthralled with his kingdom, and fairly creative prose.<br />I'll grant Martin this:  his writing style is quite good, and that kept me through this first book(plus the fact I paid too much for it)along with the few action scenes.  He actually does a decent job in keeping you interested in the realism, but there is not enough of it to keep you interested in the overall book.<br />Overall, I'm throughouly disgusted with the waste of pages and thought and money and time people have to read when picking up the likes of Martin and Jordan.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This is about as good a DVD as anyone could have hoped for from The Phantom Menace.  I won't re-review the actual movie here.  Too much cyber-space has all ready been spilled bemoaning the existence of Jar Jar.  However, this movie is best when viewed on DVD - one can cue past anything cringe-worthy and just enjoy the good parts of the film.  This is not EXACTLY the print that you saw in the movie.  Lucas, in finishing some of the deleted scenes, has decided that not all of them should have been deleted after all.  He includes more footage of Coruscant, which I feel is an improvement - any excuse to spend more time on Coruscant, the better.  Of course, this is a 2-DVD set.  There is no great need for this, all the information would have fit on both sides of one DVD, but then that would have cost us less money.  One of the prime uses of the DVD is as a \\"key\\" to access special footage at the Star Wars web site.  However, be warned that this special feature will not work unless your computer is PC.  There is about as much behind-the-scenes footage here as you could possibly want: too much for me, actually.  Best part: Ewen MacGregor after a fight scene, \\"My agent asked if I want to be in Star Wars...(...)-A I want to be in Star Wars!\\"<br />This is just the thing to whet your appetite for this summer's upcoming Star Wars movie.
B00003CX9E|5.0|The film is maube the best movie ever but the DVD set doesn't offer too much.  I would have liked there to be more than the special. Maybe another interview with Welles.
B000001ESN|5.0|&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; was Rush's foray into more concise composition -- the songs are shorter in length (except 'Natural Science', which is amazing nonetheless in its own right), more grounded lyrically, and just brilliantly delivered by all three members of the band.  A very crisp and energenic work.  As such, this may in fact be the most accessible album that Rush has delivered.<br />If you're curious about Rush, this is probably one of the first discs you should pick up.
B00005QIPH|4.0|If you wondered what would happen if Iggy Pop and Joey Ramone had a child all you have to do is listen to this album.  The Strokes are raw even though they have the catchy melodies, this is what we like.  It's the huge sound of Nirvana; it is the low fi rock that you hear from many horribly lit and sparcely populated clubs in the bad section of town.  Of course I could be wrong; it's possible they spent big bucks to get this &quot;low Production&quot; sound. The album has at least one big time radio freind in &quot; LAst Night &quot;.
0811833887|2.0|I was truly dissapointed after cracking open a recent order of &quot;The Art of Monsters Inc.&quot;  Previous editions of the Pixar Legacy have overflowed with good stuff.  Unfotunately this volume only skims the surface of what surely rests in the vaults.  (Quite possibly Pixar might not like us to know what goes on behind the scenes.) <br />Liken it to the out of print &quot;Before the Animation Begins: The Art of Disney Inspirational Sketch Artists&quot;.  But without the zest of Tengren and others.  (Carter Goodrich lends some marvelously different takes on the monster feeling.)<br />The multitude of pastel mood pieces are lively and beautifully done but overall this book lacks the superflous character development and animation insight of it's predecessors.<br />I will eagerly await a follow-up volume that might come remotely close to The Arts of Bugs Life  and Toy Story.  PLEASE!
B000005HNQ|5.0|To answer one revewiers question, this album is all of the above. It's powerful, melodic, moving, and just simply amazing!!!! The layers of keyboards completely make up the album. Giersbergen is an awesome vocalist. Gathering is a very prog-metal band, anyone into very melodic prog-metal should get this album. If you like them, I reccomened Lacuna Coil and Theatre of Tragedy, but not the album musique!!!!
0783225970|3.0|Scarface is a good movie but its not that good the performance of Al Pacino is simple amazing. Thats the only reason why you should see the movie the thing I don't like about the movie is Al Pacino charcter hes just to fake. Its just fake no one would have a mind like that but the performance is something differnt his performance is very good but the charcter he portrays is fake. As far as the violence goes its really not that bad compared to films like Meance II Society and Casino its nothing. But the violence is still bad and is for mature audences only.
B000000H57|5.0|But this has to be my favourite Type o as well as one of the best albums ever. This is just brilliant goth metal. Very atmospheric keyboards, and crunching guitar riffs. If you like fast metal, than this is deffinitly not for you. Type o is mostly slow which is always good with me. Another band like this would have to be Moonspell.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Finally MCA has decided to release the entire Who concert recorded live at Leeds university in 1970. And now that i can hear it, i really wonder why it take so long to put out this brilliant performance available in it's entirely.<BR>  Here you have a chance to hear vintage Who music: raw, loud,  in your face rock 'n roll. Entwistle playing remarkable bass lines, like a second lead guitar really (he was named by guitar magazine the best bass player of the century). Moon attacking the drums like nobody else (well...maybe John Bonham). Daltrey singing powerful lines with his howling voice...well, and finally there's Pete Townshend, the brain of The Who, power chording al the songs in a great display of rock guitar playing.<BR>   You won't be dissapointed by purchasing this double CD, it0s simply amazing!!!!
0345413377|4.0|I read the Golden Compass....and then a while after, came across the Subtle Knife....which made me go back to The Compass, and then on to the Amber Spyglass.<br />I am definitely going to re-read this book, because in my opinion, there is a whole lot going on which is hard to grasp the first time. I have to say, that at this point, the first two books grabbed me more, but I enjoyed the Spyglass, and will read it again. <br />In any case, I truly believe that this trilogy stands out among all the bland sci-fi-fantasy books out there, which drag on and on. In fact, I think it would make a great movie, too!
B00003CX5P|3.0|Where do I start. I seen Episode 1 at the movie theather the day it came out with a friend of mine who is a big time Star Wars fan. I myself enjoyed the first three, I used to have pretty much all the figures and ships when I was a little younger. (Currently in storage). To make a long story short, I didn't think this movie was that good. Sure it was one of the most hyped movie ever, but it didn't even come close to matching that hype. <br />What don't I like about this movie? Lucas tries to add more humor to it than the other movies. How many times is Jar Jar Blinks going to trip over something, knock something over and fall on his face? If I wanted to see type of humor, I would watch Comedy Central SNL and Chris Farley doing Matt Foley. I don't know what was more annoying Jar Jar Binks or Anakin. I don't blame the kid 100%, I think the writing was weak. He had too many speaking parts, plain and simple. I mean come on, he's out in space flying around. Ships are getting shot down everywhere and he tells R2 Hey let's do barrel rolls. Also what I really thought took away from the movie was all the &quot;dumb luck&quot; that happens. Jar Jar Binks screws up and takes out a dozen droids. Jar Jar screws up again, he takes out a few more. Anakin, flys into the control ship, just happens to fire the droids, hit's the control function for the droids. Also was it me or was the light saber fight very weak, especially how Darth Maul died. I give this DVD 1 star for the movie and 2 for the DVD. The DVD sounds pretty good, but IMHO there are other movies out there that sound just as good if not better. I personally think the only reason Lucas released this DVD was to build some hype for his next movie. He knew that his next one wouldn't get the same hype as Phantom after so many people walked away disapointed.
B000002QWD|5.0|This album stands as my absolute favorite Christmas CD.  The songs are just beautiful and put you right into the holiday spirit.  Besides the wonderful traditional music Bing recorded, the last two songs original songs are great as well.  I've given this CD to several people as a gift, and all have been thrilled with it.  Whether it is for you or to give to someone else, I very highly reccomend this timeless classic.
B00005OM4N|5.0|this album rocks!! i love all of the songs and i think that it is one of britney's best albums yet!! keep up the awesome work girl!! I suggest that u all go out and buy this album-it is sooo good and u will not regret it-its the cd that is always playing in my cd player!! luv ya brit!

B00005OM4N|5.0|I haven't purchased her 3rd album yet, but i know it's been worth the wait tough...i have her freshman and sophomore album and i still listen to them to this date...no need to tell ya'll i'm a die hard fan of Miss Britney, especially she's every man fantasy, in few words my fantasy...i won't lie by saying her voice is all that...i know better than that...but she kinda reminds me of Madonna when she came out in 1982, u never know maybe she's the next one!!! There's just something about Britney...as for now i'll just say she's a good entertainer, especially when she performed &quot; I'm a slave for u&quot; for the 1st time in MTV's Video Music Award...to be honest it was kinda boring besides Alicia Keys's performance, whom i appreciate a lot...this girl has talent and gonna go far!!! Now back to Britney...besides all the critics and there's gon' be some, i would love to thank Miss Spears to entertaint us with her songs and her moves, she's got a body to die for, she's cool and also doin' the right thing!!! I luv u Briney and i'm a 25 yo haitian man who knows the difference between a good entertainer and a good singer!!! And believe me Dahling u belong to the entertainment world, everything happends for a reason and the 2000 decade belongs to you just like the 80's and the 90's belonged to Madonna...so do ur thing girl and pay no mind to the medias and their critics, they're doin' their jobs just as much as u r doin' urs....i hope one day we meet or at least i attend one of ur concert, that's my dream...i'm listening to your hit &quot;I'm a slave for u&quot; right now, which reminds me of &quot;Nasty girl&quot; by Vanity 6....one more i adore u babe and u r fierce...trust me on that one baby girl!!!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spear's third self-titled CD is a leap in the young artist's career and should be examined as such. Britney has highs and lows, as all cds do, but it is Britney's charisma that brings one through these valleys. Outstandingly funky &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; demonstrate that the artist not only can stick to proven pop formulae but can also branch out into Timbaland-esque R&amp;B style beats. &quot;Overprotected&quot; is very much akin to &quot;Stronger&quot; from &quot;Oops...I Did It Again&quot; and fans of that set will instantly recognize the hooks and let those hooks take them into pop bliss. &quot;Lonely&quot; is enjoyable but &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; underscores Britney's lack in the vocal department.The duet/song with love Justin Timberlake is very enjoyable but fails to bend any rules as far as in general makeup and style. One glaring weakness is &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot;, the cover of the classic song. Britney must establish herself with her own material and stop rehashing others in order to cement herself as a challenger to Madonna's crown. Overall, &quot;Britney&quot; is the artist's foray into adulthood, and should be examined in light of such. Overall, an excellent buy for Britney and contemporary pop fans alike.
B0000584V3|5.0|Simply put, this album is amazing. Great acoustic numbers and great melodic death/black metal. I'm normally more into grindcore and experimental/ambient but I have to say that this album was well worth the money. What amazes me the most is that singer Mikael Akerfeldt can not only get the most out of a death metal &quot;cookie monster&quot; voice but the dood can also sing.......and sing well. The rest of the band members also play with an extreme amount of talent, all of them are damn good musicians. What's funny is that my mom was actually digging on one of their songs (Harvest). This album is a good one to listen to on a dark rainy day, it sets the mood completely
B00003CX5P|2.0|Just saw it again ... and it's much worse than I remembered! The visuals are great, some of them even beautiful, but the script and editing are horrible, mundane, plodding, and just plain silly. I thought the Ewoks were bad enough, but this episode is just goofy.<br />And it's not just Jar Jar. Take him out (yeah, dream on) and you've still got a slowish mishmash of unimaginative drivel. Sure, Anakin looks cute when he curls his lip during the pod race, but what of the rest? The best part of the whole movie - the Jedi-Sith duel - is short and not always well photographed.<br />The plot borders on idiotic. You have to see it for yourself (well, don't if you don't have to) to appreciate the understatement I'm using here.<br />Terrible plot. Yawn of a set piece (the pod race). Jar-Jar. What an amazing achievement, to have spent so much time and money to come up with this uneven, childish, silly movie.<br />It has its moments. It's fun to see Jedi slashing and jumping and kicking their way through the movie. But there's not enough of it to hide it's Ewok-type elements, such as little Anakin saving the day ... by mistake.<br />Great graphics, although some of the design could have been better, from the bland-oniony design of the Naboo fighters to the (yes) stereotyped aliens.<br />Aaargh!<BR>It's hard to state just how bad this film really is. I didn't think so before I saw it again on TV. I actually taped it, but promptly reused the tape afterwards to tape the end of a Seinfeld episode (Jerry: \\"What's mine is yours.\\" Kramer: \\"Really?\\").<br />I've heard the DVD features are good, but I can't bring myself to rent it.<br />Just awful.
B00003CY3W|5.0|Director Terry Zwigoff has just done the impossible: he has created the first movie about teens that will appeal more to adults than to teens themselves. More than just another run-of-the-mill teenage movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a striking black comedy that deals with being different, and while it's certainly not the first film to showcase outcast teenagers, it's definitely the most invigorating. <br />Based on the original underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the film follows the lives of best friends Enid and Rebecca, who could not be happier to have graduated high school. With them, they carry their rejection of all things popular, angst for their air-headed, well-to-do classmates, and dreams that have nothing to do with college, education, or anything outside of working and living in an apartment together. <br />Feeling mischievous one afternoon, they come across a personals ad in the newspaper, and decide to reply with an invitation to meet the mystery man at a retro diner. This practical joke later becomes a threat to their friendship, as Enid's fascination with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-aged music lover with similar social outsider traits, begins to block out her bond with Rebecca and their dream of sharing an apartment. <br />The two girls are played by actresses Thora Birch (&quot;American Beauty&quot;) and Scarlet Johansson (&quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot;), who form the most believable best friend duo of the year. As Enid, Birch has a great knack for sarcasm, employing a wonderfully adept use of facial expressions and humorous wit that provides most of the film's comedic moments. Johansson's character is more reserved, and she handles the transitions in Rebecca's life with effective results. And Buscemi is quite the outsider as Seymour; his character's differences are given such an excellent treatment by his acting. <br />Clowes's screenplay is a perfect balance of humor and drama, providing us with a mixed bag of emotions that blend together very effectively. The first half of the film, devoted to the development of the friendship between Enid and Rebecca after graduation, is a canvas of lightweight jokes and situational humor resulting from their unabashed actions. Since we are given the chance to become acquainted with the two, the second half of the film is easier to connect with. <br />As the characters begin to separate into their own worlds, the story leaves much of the humor behind and takes on a serious demeanor, that which is none-the-less affecting. As Enid's future hangs in the balance, I was willing to stay with the film, eager to see her resolve her self-conflicts and achieve a state of happiness. This leads to an ending that some will dispute over for its ambiguity, though it allows us the decision of whether or not the movie ends happily; it all depends on your own attitude. <br />Dense and filled with magnificent acting and a terrific sense of humor, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is one of the best movies of the year, and one of the most involving films to come along in some time. The laughs are fresh and utterly original, while the story provides a unique look at all things abnormal. The film dares to ask the question, &quot;What is normal?&quot; through its characters, yet leaves us with no simplified answer to this difficult point.
B000002UB3|5.0|The reviews here have already said much about how wonderful this album is.  I just want to point out that the second side (on the original record) was a complete unit -- a densely packed, integrated, continuous musical form.  I'm not aware of any group having done this.  \\"Tommy\\" and other rock operas are in the same ballpark, but those have a much looser construction.  The Beatles opened the door here, as they did so often in other aspects of their work, but no one else seems to have walked through it.  A pity.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I'll come right out and say it: &quot;Shrek&quot; is one of the best movies of the year, a nonstop laugh riot with a morality lesson and extremely likeable characters in tow. In fact, this highly unconventional fairy tale boasts so many winning voices performances and completely riotous humor that it's impossible not to be dazzled by its irresistible charm and tenacious wit. Of course, this is no Disney movie, but it doesn't attempt to be, and that makes it even better. <br />Perhaps the most winning aspect of this delight is its successful ability to turn the clichéd fairy tale into a fresh and inviting premise, where nothing is what we have come to believe it should be. Poking fun at the Disney franchise, the plot surrounds a lonely ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), who lives in solitude not so much because he wants to, but because he feels his physical appearance is appalling to others. So it comes as a shock when several Disney characters appear at his door, cast out of their kingdom by the devious Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). <br />This is where the movie takes everything we know about fantasy and reverses it. Shrek becomes the hero of sorts, the gallant knight in shining armor who journeys to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who lays sleeping in the tower of a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Why does he do it? Not for love, but for the deed to his swampland, which he will receive upon delivering the princess to Farquaad's kingdom. <br />And just as Shrek is characterized out of the ordinary, so is Princess Fiona, who becomes a witty, easily irritable kung-fu goddess instead of the clichéd waif of standard fairy tales. This new spin on the damsel in distress is frequently funny, showcased most notably in a scene in which a French Robin Hood attempts to win her heart, only to feel the heel of her boot (add this scene to the list of ongoing &quot;Matrix&quot; spoofs). Her awaiting Lord Farquaad is also not the standard villain: his height leaves much to be desired, providing for various jokes and humor at his expense. <br />These characters are some of the best of their kind, completely animated yet easy to get a feel for. The combined talents of Myers, Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow all combust to make these characters more convincing and humorous than most others of the genre. The computer animation aspect is not new, but has developed over the years since &quot;Toy Story;&quot; here, its purpose is not to instill a sense of realism (we can discern it as fantasy), but to add to the cheeriness and freshness of the already exuberant plot. <br />The layout of the film's script is amazing, a work of comedic art that transcends all comedy genres to become a good-natured laugh riot. The constant ramblings of Eddie Murphy will no doubt please kids and adults alike, while the various spoofs of fairy tales will induce fits of laughter. At one point, Lord Farquaad interrogates the Gingerbread Man by dangling him over a glass of milk, then questions Snow White's magic mirror as to who his bride will be. A few instances of toilet humor make this animated feature somewhat ambitious, but it knows its limits and complies with them. <br />The film's morality lesson about the judgmental society is also one of its strong points. Shrek is seen as monstrous by various characters, though his winning charm and sense of humor provide the age-old lesson that it's what's inside a person that truly counts. The secret behind Princess Fiona also helps to advance this point, and by the film's end, it has succeeded in making that point splendidly. <br />My face bore a great smile during the beginning moments of &quot;Shrek,&quot; and remained that way throughout the entire movie. The film is a wondrous spectacle of animation, well-liked characters, and some of the most enlightening humor of any movie this year. It's ability to turn our vision of a fairy tale completely upside down is a rousing success, as is virtuallyeverything else about this enormously entertaining treat.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Who doesn&#8217;t love Godfather I & II?  That&#8217;s not the question.  The question is what the hell was Francis Ford Coppola THINKING by putting his daughter Sophia in a staring role in Godfather III?!?!  My GOD she couldn&#8217;t act her way out of a wet paper bag.  ARGH!!  I hate to rehash this point but I really think it needs to be stressed that she should be banned from ever acting again.  Have seen some of her directing and I think she should stay behind the camera.<br />Ok, ok, I&#8217;m not writing this to trash Sophia (well, maybe a little) but to praise The Godfather I & II.  I was waiting for all three movies to released in a box set and was happy to get it.  I had been warned about GF III by everyone I knew but I still tried to watch it with an open mind.  Too bad it just as everyone said.  Awful.  Other than that, the new transfer is amazing, and the sound incredible!  I scared the (...) out of the girls down stairs from me during the first gunfight when the AC3 kicked in.  They actually came up to check if I was ok!  Now THAT&#8217;S a good soundtrack!<br />I haven&#8217;t had a chance to watch the bonus disk yet, but I am saving it for a (...) day this winter.  I can&#8217;t wait.
B000003N8R|5.0|If you are interested in jazz and even mildly interested in <BR>listening to John Coltrane's music,this CD,in my mind,is the<BR>starting point. No other CD covers the beauty and power,along<BR>with the lyricism that is Coltrane. Crescent was written and<BR>performed in a very fertile period of Coltrane's life,right<BR>&quot;near&quot; A Love Supreme(which should be the next step). The<BR>disc flows as well as any other jazz disc I have heard. This,<BR>I believe is Trane's &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;. All of his work is <BR>excellent,but this is the most accessable to the average<BR>jazz fan not familar with a lot of his other music.<br />So,if you're interested in listening to Trane's music, jump<BR>&quot;on board&quot; Crescent. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B00005JKHP|1.0|I remember the film moving slow, but I was almost in a coma by the end.  There was just not enough of story to warrant two hours for this film.  So, we see long static shots of the Enterprise and space that do not move the story.<br />The acting was even worse.  Part of the reason this film dragged so much is that the director and the actor's did not build the tension of their impending doom.  It is hard to get caught up in the chance of them all dying when the actors are just like it's any other day at the office.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I love most of the other Star Trek movies, but this one is just a major dissapointment.
B00002EPJH|5.0|Fans of George Winston,along with Jarrett or Bill Evans<BR>fans should like this disc. Here is Jarrett finally <BR>relaxing from his propulsive style that he seems to favor<BR>and beautifully delivering some great songs on the solo<BR>piano. The song Shenandoah is worth the price of the <BR>disc alone.
0385505833|5.0|This book was  a very fast read at only 177 pages, but the things that go on in those 177 pages are funny and touching. For all of us who hate the hustle and bustle of the holidays this a book that we can relate to.
B00005N83O|3.0|This is sort of a hate and love situation with &quot;J.LO.&quot; Back in 99 when her first single came out I scoffed at the idea of actress turned singer and immediately rode her off, but once Waiting For Tonight hit airwaves I was instantly impressed. Then comes her sophmore release and once again I find myself hating the first single, Love Don't Cost A Thing, but the second I heard Play come on the radio I turned up the volume key and just moved with the groove. I've grown tired of it already (which is the major problem with pop and me) but I can't seem to get enough of Walking On Sunshine and the spanish dance funkish Aint It Funny and Dame (Touch Me.) I also enjoy the r&amp;b spiced Dance With Me, and the slow ballad, That's Not Me. But I must declare how much I deteste and spit at I'm Real - especially the remix version with Ja Rule... Ugh!!! Overall, though, this is fairly enjoyable and worth a listen or two. Definitely nothing special, though.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I'm tired of listening to people talk about the Strokes, but I've listened to the album maybe 50 times now and I'm not tired of it yet.  It still makes me want to dance.  It always puts me in a great mood.  I'm not going to suggest you will like them if you like \\"blah bleh bleh\\".  Shut up already.  (...) Just listen to the sound samples, and if you like it, buy it.  That's why you're checking Amazon anyway, right?
0812550706|5.0|This is my favorite book ever. If u like sci-fi read it! Anyone who doesn't like it is stupid cuz they don't get it so read it
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White, as we remember it, is wonderful on DVD. My almost 4 year old granddaughter loves it and it has become her favorite video. (Grandma has a large collection just for her, too.)<br />There also is a huge amount of material about the making of SW, Barbra singing, things not used in the movie, and more, all for the curious adult. It's hard to realize now just how groundbreaking this movie was when it was released.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is truly one of the best DVDs to own.Im addition to the many bonus features such as the audio for the 1937 World Premiere, and the French language audio track, there's Dopey's Wild Ride game which my entire family is enjoying.  It had a 3D effect and you really feel like you're riding inside that cave. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this DVD.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I'm not a trekkie and as a rule I was lukewarm about the original series and I'm even less a fan of the other Star Trek films or the subsequent 'Next Generation' or later series.<br />I am, however, a film enthusiast and a lover of great science fiction literature, and though the rest of the Star Trek universe is often just average-quality pop culture which takes a back seat to Lucas' imagination for entertainment value, this particular Star Trek film stands above the other Star Trek offerings as a visionary statement on the human condition as we in the 21st century approach the inevitable complete merging of humanity and technology.<br />This film doesn't play like a Spock-vs-Doc shoot-'em-up at all; its pace is more like Antonioni's films (think L'avventura or Red Desert) and the scope will remind you of 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film is, however, more accessible and for me at least, is a more emotional experience as well. It bears repeating: this film is unlike any of the other Star Trek films.<br />Not to be missed; don't listen to the disgruntled trekkies!
B00005RHGK|1.0|Let's just say that I jumped at the very begining and for me to do that, wow, it's a beautiful thing.  This movie could have been so good.  It started out calm and mellow then BAMM out of no where loud noisy car screchs, screams, and jumpable footage.  But after I learned that our main characted, WHO IS A GUY, has a Rose tatooed around his belly button, CAN WE GET ANY LAMMER!?, I began to loose faith.  The creature was rather cool in the begining.  We don't see it until the middle of the movie.  This is the Technique that was so perfectly used by Ridley Scott in Alien. THAT IS A TRUE MODERN HORROR FILM!  Then when we finaly see the monster we see a lot of familurarities of past horror creatures.  Classic Bat wings, a grey, leathery body.  Then it does something.  It what, Makes a really loud obnoctious noise and then these Spices pop off it's face and create this webbed hat thing that looks like and inverted Tricerotops's frill.  And in the end.  Our main Character so creativly named Jilly or something like that I FOUND THIS FITTIN BECAUSE HE HAS A GIRL'S NAME AND A ROSE TATOOED ON HIS STOMACH Get's offed and all we see is his face which still has perfect for except for the fact that his eyes are missing and our creature stands up behind him and it's eyes meet perfectly with Jilly's and we see his bright brand new eyes he just ate.  BTW.  He has to eat the body part in order for it to replace his.  Plot wasn't all to bad but this movie could have been so much better than what it was.  Honestly the Trailor made me more afraid to walk to the bathroom at night than the actual movie.   Don't waist your hard earned money on this Hollywood Flop.
B000009QPE|5.0|When this thing came out in '86, it set the standard on which all metal albums would follow in that era of aggressive metal. If you dont own this one......you need to get it and get it now.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann has taken on Hugo's La Dame Aux Camelias and managed to transform it into a fin de siecle Traviata substituting Verdi's score with a collage of sweet and romantic late 20th century songs. The whole movie has been one of the most OTT camp and indeed operatic overall treatments that has ever been seen on film.  Certainly this movie is more visually stunning than anything I have ever seen before.  The sheer lyrical beauty of the sets, costumes, coreography and especially of Nicole Kidman who is dazzling as Satine are breathtaking.  I have seen this movie three times already and it seems to get better each time you see it.  It has been a long time that any movie so makes you walk out of the theatre wishing you were young and in love.  This is a film that is perfect for those moments when you are feeling a bit blue and sorry for yourself.  I can imagine that there are those who found this film difficult, however I can also imagine that they are those who have never know what it feels like to be in love.  This is not a film that one should review in a cerebral and objective way but one which to enjoy as a feast to the senses.  Beauty truth freedom and love ..... its is all of those things and more
B00005QDW5|4.0|I really hate to say it, but this greatest hits package was very dissapointing for me.   I love Pink Floyd's music-I own everything on cd.  But the tracklisting on these two discs is very strange.  First of all, key tracks were left off, such as Pigs (Three Different Ones), Run Like Hell, and Brain Damage/Eclipse.  And including the Syd Barrett era songs just doesn't fit in.  But it is nice to have the new mixes of Echoes and Shine On, as well as When the Tigers Broke Free.  I just wish they had held on to the early tracks for another compilation.
0440213525|2.0|This book had an explosive start and then fizzled out.  I was hoping for a big, unpredictable ending but the ending was no surprise.  Several aspects of the story are left unfinished at the end and I was hoping more details about what happened to some of the other people would be presented.  The story takes so long (566 pages) just to get to the end, and then it all gets wrapped up too fast.  I've read 4 other grisham books and I put this one ranked #4 out of the 5 I read. (#1 A Time to Kill, #2 the Firm, #3 The Partner, #4 Client, #5 The Testament)
0792839129|5.0|I've seen this many times, and never tire of it.  It's a great film for the entire family, a great escape into fantasy.  I'd give it more stars if I could.
B00000JGHM|5.0|The scene in the restaurant where Pacino and DeNiro meets for the first time was worth the price of admission in the theaters. The scary part is the fact I found myself wanting DeNiro to escape despite the fact he just killed several policemen, and I'm civic minded, pro-death penalty type of guy! Michael Mann keeps getting better at his vocation.
B00005QDW5|5.0|ok well the only pink floyd thing other than this i have is the wall live and division bell. This is exactly what you will want if your starting out a pink floyd fan. It covers a range of their carrer which is good and is bad at a couple of songs. Younger fans wont like songs like see emily play as it's a little cheezy. But songs like comftably numb and high hopes just rule. 95% of the songs on this totaly rule. Wish you were here too. DO your self a favour and give this one a listenas it's well worth it. Also TOOL fans should check this out. TOOL is based on floyd with the long songs, weird sounds, and albums ( the wall compared to lateralus)that are made like soundtracks. The guitaring is fantastic on this album too. Also if u own on all the PF albums get it cos it's got a new song and much better sound. Thanks for reading.
B00005R23S|5.0|A monumental chronicle; one that deserves a place in any music lover's collection and a mandatory addition for the devoted. The band has never sounded so good, especially with the addition of a 3rd guitar! The playing is strong and self-assured. I'm waiting for my breath to return. Deserves at least six stars.    This DVD begs to be played on HDTV and a monster sound system. Trust me, inside the case is a label instructing you to turn off your player's Dolby compression. Grab onto something!
B00005QCYC|4.0|The first JP blew everyone away. It was unlike anything anyone had ever seen.  The story was well-developed and believable, and the special F/X knocked everything else off the charts.<br />JP2, ahhhh.  JP2 just blew everyone.<br />But JP3 was an amazing recovery!  It had the most dinosaurs, most action, most suspense, and most gore (don't even pretend like you don't want it) of all!<br />JP1-**** / JP2-** / JP3-*****
630522577X|4.0|This great musical is not without controversy. The snubbing of Julie Andrews in favor of the elegant but less-tuneful Audrey Hepburn is still a source of debate. George Cukor felt more comfortable with the famous Audrey, who wasn't allowed to sing but cleaned up nicely as Eliza Doolittle, flower seller urchin turned faux duchess. But Ms Andrews showed her Oscar-winning stuff in Mary Poppins (same year, can you believe it?) and certainly could dress for success as she showed later in Victor, Victoria. So we are left wondering what My Fair Lady would have been like with the unforgettable voice of Andrews.<br />That may be the only weakness, however. After all these years, the sets, the otherwise superb cast, the glorious costumes and above all, Lerner and Lowe's matchless score are still magical. If you are a costume buff, check out the incredible skill used to stage the Ascot Racing Day scene. The clothes are all black, white and grey, but each uses a slightly different shade of white or grey so that the scene doesn't look flat and cartoonish. Many musicals just don't make it on the big screen. This one soars.
0792153189|1.0|With just three films under her belt, Mimi Leder has established herself as a legitimate contender for the title of the Worst Mainstream Director working today.  What distinguishes Leder from other mediocre directors is that she seems to take her films so incredibly seriously.  Exhibit one: Deep Impact.<br />In a familiar plot, it is discovered that, in just a few short weeks, a gigantic meteor is going to wipe out all life on Earth.  The film becomes about how the people of Earth prepare to meet their fate and in Leder's utopian vision, that fate is met with dignity.  Never has dignity been quite as sickening and downright dull as in this film.  In attempt to qualify as an &quot;epic,&quot; the film follows four interconnected plotlines that are meant to illuminate the full reach of the human experience.  Unfortunately, the film doesn't have enough imagination for one plotline and, in the end you get four subplots involving generic, uninteresting characters doing just what you'd expect them to.<br />In the first plotline, we meet a crew of brave astronaughts who are sent to make a last ditch effort to save our planet.  The crusty old timer is played by Robert Duvall. This plotline is actually halfway compelling.  Natrually, Leder devotes the least amount of time to it.<br />In our second plotline, Elijah Wood plays a high school science nerd who discovers the meteor that's going to kill everyone on the planet.  Natrually, this makes him the most popular kid in school.  He gets to speak at a school assembly where all of his soon-to-be-horribly-killed classmates applaud him and assure him that he's now going to have more sex than he knows what to do with.  Hmmm...maybe this is the way Leder and the film's writers would like to think a bunch of high school kids would react to their impending doom.  I have doubts that the nerdy kid who just told everyone they're going to die would then be reborn as some sort of apocalyptic sex symbol.  But maybe I just need to go hangout in Hollywood a little bit more.<br />In the most mundane plotline, Tea Leoni is cast as a newswoman who basically uncovers Wood's discovery and, despite the best efforts of the government, broadcasts this news to the world.  To the abject horror of any viewer who hasn't been meditating for the past few years, Leoni's scenes are used to make big statements about life.  Leoni is a wonderful comedic actress so natrually, she plays a totally humorless character here and looks bored to be doing it.  Her rich, vaguely European parents are divorced and are played by Vanessa Redgrave and Maximellian Schell.  Redgrave is a bit of a pain as she tells us that the knowledge of her impending death is probably the best thing that could have happened.  Its freed her up to concentrate on living, she tells Leoni.  It would be interesting to see how somebody who was neither rich nor old would react to that.  I doubt that a guy in his early twenties who is working retail to pay for college would be as content to hear that he's now going to die before he can accomplish anything.  But, we don't get to hear from any of those folks, perhaps because Leder hasn't ever met any in Hollywood.  If this seems to be a petty complaint, its one that Leder opens herself up to by presenting Redgrave's silly comments as an important statement.<br />Lastly, Morgan Freeman is the President.  Freeman's one of the few actors out there who can convey the type of moral weight that the role calls for.  But wouldn't the film have been much more interesting if, instead of some all-seeing, wise leader -- we'd instead had, say, Peter Sellers' President Merkin Muffley from Dr. Strangelove?  It doesn't help that Freeman's plan to save humanity (all the important people hide out in underground caves for a few years while all the unimportant people die) is the exact same plan proposed in Dr. Strangelove.  <br />Of course, what's truly annoying is that once this plan is announced, its accepted by everyone with, of course, dignity.  Sure, we get a few shots of an angry crowd trying to get into the caves but those crowds are made up of extras.  The characters we've gotten to see all except their fate with a stoic acceptance that wouldn't be so offensive if not for that fact that Leder seems to be so convinced that this foolish display is somehow making an invaluable statement about the human condition.  Couldn't we see just one character say, &quot;Wait a minute -- I'm going to die and that little pipsqueak Wood gets to live just because he discovered the stupid meteor!?&quot;  But no, that just wouldn't fit into the film's artistic aspirations.  Watching all of this, one is reminded that Ed Wood sincerely did mean for Plan 9 to be a touching anti-war statement.  Leder's film -- with its thinly drawn characters and niavely smug attempts to be important -- may have made her feel like a better human being but that doesn't make it any less of a pain to sit through.
B00004XQ83|5.0|As a professional dancer I love this soundtrack.  There are a number of songs that warrent chroreography.  This soundtrack not only makes me dance, but it also makes me sing.  I love the female vocals in songs like &quot;I'll Fly Away,&quot;  &quot;Come On Down,&quot; and &quot;Nobody Left but the Baby.&quot;  One finds a simplistic sweetness in these songs. There's some great musicianship in many of the other tunes too.  It's a great collection of old time music and something in it for everybody.  I highly recommend it for music lovers of all ages (my kid likes it too).
0446310786|5.0|I had read this book in high school and had forgotten how great a book this was. This book has so much in the story that makes you think and alot of it makes you relate to real life.<br />The character's in story reach out to you in way that makes you feel like you are in there world. Scout was one of my favorite charactors the way she was through the book. My other favorite charactor is Jem. I love how both of the kids were afraid of so much but from there fear they learned so much. I also love how they stood by people in the story.<br />Overall I forgot just how good this classic novel this was and I wish Harper Lee had written more books.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I like this movie soooo much. Lots of allusions to other movies. A perfect computer-animation...great. The Special Edition is worth every little penny. A must have for every collector.
B000051VWW|5.0|&quot;Lovers Rock&quot; is a truely excellent album. I have been a fan of Sade since their debut and I can honestly say that &quot;Lovers Rock&quot; contains some of their best work. This album is uniformly good, which is rare. It's hard to pick out one song as the best from an album so good but, I would have to say that the best songs are &quot;Slave Song&quot;, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;, &quot;King Of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Every Word&quot;. I really couldn't choose just one.
B0000584V3|5.0|I was more then a little apprehensive to get this album.  I've never been to keen (and am still not) on the garbage disposal sounding growling vocals that is this genre.  However I heard they're quite progish so I decided to give it a try... The music blew me away from the start brilliant musicianship with tons of intensity and intelligence.  The aspect of this album that makes it so good is that Opeth mixes good acoustic work along with clean vocals.  Yes there is plenty of growling but only when in makes sense to be there, and there are plenty of clean vox mixed in nearly ever song.  The lyrics are smart and very well written.  They're kinda dark and good if you're not in the best of moods.  The highlights for this album are \\"Harvest\\", which is the only acoustic song on the album. The other highlights are \\"Bleak\\" and \\"The Drapery Falls\\" both with en excellent mix of heavy and gentle put together seamlessly.  All around a great album if you can get by the growling and hear the prog elements and a satisfying listen. I look forward to a few more of their albums!
B00001U0DP|5.0|I recently saw the list of the all-time favorite foreign movies as rated by moviegoers and this one topped the list.  I am hardly surprised.  In fact I have yet to come across a person who has told me that he doesn't like this film.  When people watch a movie, they expect to be entertained.  Some expect to be touched, while others expect to be impressed.  'Life is beautiful' is capable of doing all that and more. <br />A good comedy is hard to execute, a 'tragicomedy' harder and to draw a comedy out of the darkest period of mankind is almost impossible.  Benigni begged to differ.  His mind was set on showing you that laughter is the remedy of all ills.  He would make you forget to cry without demeaning the gravity of the situation.  Only at the very end would you feel the weight of this crime against humanity.<br />The reason why the film works so well is because he brilliantly divided it up into two almost distinct segments.  Like a good salesman, before he makes the sale pitch, he would like to get personal with you.  For the first hour or so, he would introduce you to his family, charm you endlessly and before you have the chance to get bored, he would take you to the gutter.  By the time you are in the slaughterhouse (in this case literally), he has built up enough credibility that you no longer doubt him.   By that point, you would laugh with him and not at him.<br />This film is not only about the triumph of humankind, it is also a triumph of moviemaking.  Like everyone else in the room, I am eagerly awaiting what mischief Benigni is up to next.  Will it get any better than this?
0780624890|4.0|I have always liked Vampire movies, (The Lost Boys), (Intervew with a Vampire),(fright Night). If you like any of them, then you will probably like Blade. <br />A man who was born to a vampire is only half a vampire. He does not suffer from the weeknesses of a vampire, but he hates what he is.  His mission in life is to use his own Vampire powers to destroy all vampires, but the vampires want his blood so they can be a day walker like he is.  The fighting scenes are great, and the special effects are great.  If you like vampires, check this one out.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Self-proclaimed die-hard Incubus fans who still crank S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and shun the softer side of Make Yourself will undoubtedly turn their noses up to the all-grown-up Incubus album, Morning View.  So let them, but don't knock the album until you've given it a listen or two.<br />Brandon Boyd's amazing voice was given a place to shine on Make Yourself.  Morning View seems to do the same for the versatility of guitarist Mike Einziger.  There's some hard, electric-guitar reminiscent of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and some more subdued acoustic we first heard in the popular acoustic version of &quot;Pardon Me.&quot;  In addition, Einziger shows a new side of his musical abilities, as does the rest of the band, in the Eastern-sounding &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;  Boyd's voice is still appealing, but in this album, he is no longer the only star.<br />Lyrically, the album seems to be one big post break-up record.  One can almost follow the stages of grief in the sad-sounding, almost angsty tracks, &quot;11 am&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot;; the anger in &quot;Under My Umbrella&quot; and the glimmer of hope that is &quot;Aqueous Transmission.&quot;  The more optimistic messages in &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Are You In&quot; seem forced, especially in the latter track which seems to have been thrown on the album almost as an afterthought.<br />If Incubus are sellouts, it's because pop radio found them, not because they pushed their way into the mainstream.  In other words, I'm willing to forgive the TRL appearances; they're there because the MTV viewers want them, not because they want the MTV viewers.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is a great record, as is Make Yourself, but it would be laughable to assume that a band will write music in their mid-twenties that sounds the same as what they wrote as teenagers.  If former Incubus fans are looking for music that sounds like Enjoy Incubus, there are plenty of teenage bands out there in their parents' garages that would love the support.  For thoseof us whose tastes have grown with the band's, enjoy Morning View.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Hey, I bought this CD the day it came out!! I love it!! Here's my review of each song:<br />1. I'm a Slave 4 U- This was a great song to choose for her first single, but I hate the music video!! It's kind of funky sounding, I'm never heard a song like it before. 8.5/10<br />2. Overprotected- My absolute favorite song on the album!! Her enhanced cd with a concert performance w/ outtakes from her movie Crossroads is awesome!! This song has a great sound, and I heard that this song is her 3rd single, it'll definitely be a hit!! 10/10<br />3. Lonely- I love the way she's telling that boy how it is in this song, it's a great message!! It's a very fast and upbeat song, great to dance to! 8/10<br />4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman- Her only ballad on the album, and her second single. Her voice has really matured since her ,,,Baby One More Time days!! She can really carry out those notes!! This is my twin sister's favorite song. I saw a preview of the music video, and it looks awesome!! 10/10<br />5, Boys- Very catchy song!! I love the chorus. Not the greatest song on the album though, 7/10<br />6. Anticipating- This a very sweet song, with like an 80-ish sound. It's also a good song to dance too. 9/10<br />7. I Love Rock and Roll- I am loving this song! It's a great cover, much better that I Can't Get No Satisfaction!! This is a great song to blast on your CD player..I have several times, and it's driving my parents crazy!! LOL, 9.5/10<br />8. Cinderella- Good song, but not my favorite. Kinda weird.7.5/10<br />9. Let Me Be- This is a cool song w/ Britney declaring her independence. It's also on the On The Line soundtrack. Good song, but gets annoying after awhile. 8/10<br />10. Bombastic Love- Reminds me of her old days, with bubblegum pop. Cute song though. 8.5/10<br />11. That's Where You Take Me- I like this song a lot!! It's a lot like Sometimes. It's a good song for couples. 9/10<br />12.  What It's Like to Be Me- My least favorite song on the album, it's weird....in a bad way!! Her voice sounds horrible. 4/10<br />Go out and buy this CD, I love it!! I hope my review helped u!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|An album that ranks among his best. Dylan weaves many forms of American music into this album, then puts his own distinctive spin on it all. The attention given to both production and lyrical content make this one to savor.
0684867621|2.0|I used to be a HUGE King fan.  However, his recent stuff simply pales in comparison to his earlier works, and this book is a prime example.  Little girl lost is NOT what King does best, and using that as his premise doomed the book from the beginning.  King is at his best when he does sprawling semi-supernatural, semi-horror thrillers like IT and the Stand(two of the best horror works ever written).  He is not at his best with short puff pieces.  Just like Tommie himself is breaking down as a reliever, Steve is, unfortunately, breaking down as an author.
0515125024|4.0|This is my second Jack Reacher adventure.  What an adventure too.  These books are preposterous and such good fun!  The place where Reacher crawls thru a mine fissure is chilling! I couldnt sit still. Perhaps it worked on my own fears.  Jack Reacher is a tall hunk, a cross between John Wayne and Sylvester Stallone.  I know he will fix everything in the end.  What a guy! The world is still safe! On to the next one..........
B00005QDW5|1.0|When, oh when will there be a definitive collection of Pink Floyd released to the public?  Not in our lifetime it appears.  I looked forward to this 2-CD compilation, thinking &quot;It's about time!&quot;, only to be disappointed once again, and cancelled my order upon learning what the cuts included on this so-called &quot;Best of&quot; farce would be.  Way too much space is devoted to early Floyd's Syd Barrett psychedelic noodlings, and not enough to truly essential Floyd.  Left off this compilation are such songs as &quot;Is There Anybody In There?&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Brain Damage&quot; . . well, you get the picture.  Oh well, maybe some day . . .
0345448898|5.0|As a new reader of Philip Pullman ( and now most likely his greatest fan ) , I had a hard time over the first 100 pages , but was completely involved in the story and bonded to the characters after. <BR>I never had so much fun and pain reading books like in this case, especially because Pullman here deals with the major features of life - faith, religion, deception and most important  love ! I was completely overwhelmed by the power and depth of The Amber Spy Glass as I never expected a children's book being so dark and serious without being heavy .<BR>I will miss Lyra and Pantalaimon very much , in fact while reading the books  I caught myself more than once hoping and wishing  I could ( or would ) have a Daemon !
6305546789|5.0|Halloween has recently been dubbed by Shivers magazine as \\"the scariest 20th century movie ever\\".  And whose to argue that?<br />With excellent acting from Nick Castle (Michael Myers) who plays him with unholy relish one cannot but be dazzled at this film's grace.<br />Jamie Lee Curtis' premier film is indeed powerful, again the first proper scream queen we ever had. The story is quite simple to understand. A homicidal maniac (Myers) escapes from a mental institution making a night of babysitting turn in to a night of pure hell for an unsuspecting babysitter (Curtis)<br />Support roles from Donald Pleasance as the half mad psychologist of Myers also add to this film's classic touch, which shall never appear dusty on any video store's horror shelf!<br />A must for Horror fans.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie. Afterwards a friend of mine called me and asked how it was.  I replied: &quot;Well, it was great, awesome, spectacular&quot;, &quot;that good ?&quot; he replied.  &quot;No&quot; I answered, &quot;it was better, it's a masterpiece.&quot;<BR>Yes, I didn't know anything about the film and was a little bit confused in the beginning by the cutting, zooming and movements that made me a bit dizzy.  Not a very good start I thought, but then it really started.<BR>This simple story about the poor man, rich man and the beautiful girl, turned into a visual feast for eye and ear.<BR>I am a middle age man and tough as I am, then I could not stop tears running on several occations during the film while enjoying the music and the performance of Ewan and Nicole. Their duet made of 1-2 lines from popular lovesongs was great, but the Roxanne scene blew my mind.  One of the best I've ever seen.<BR>There are weak points in this movie, but the overall effect is so overwhelming that it left me and others sitting awhile after the film ended to savour the feeling we got during the film.  There are many years since I have got this great feeling while watching a movie.  The goosebumps the amazement and the whole emotion was just terrific.<BR>This movie is now on my top 10 and will most likely be there for a very long time.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|What a great, refreshing movie this is! I was so pleasantly surprised with it. I think what I like most about it is that it does not take itself too seriously and pokes fun at other movies in this similar genre (such as Disney movies). It really is a hoot and great entertainment. This film is not really for kids, more like young adults and adults young at heart. I found it much more fun than anything by Disney or Pixar.<br />The DVD presentation is wonderful and the DTS soundtrack is so involving it practically tickles your ears!
B00000JG41|5.0|So, you listened to the first album and after a while you got used to it and figured you knew what was going on.  Then Disco Volante comes out and you buy it all psyched for the low brow funk metal and instead get a cd full of extreme jazz improv and sinister Italian dialogue.  So California comes out, and you brace yourself for what seems like it should be the most extreme musical work ever and get....some lovely Hawaiian guitars and flowing bossanova beats.  Mr. Bungle is not a band you can pidgeonhole other than saying they are REALLY talented.  They could have done something more extreme, but that would have been predictable, so they tried their hand at pop.  Well, sort of Bunglized pop, but the music on this cd is generally fairly pleasent on the surface.  I actually heard Vanity Fair on the radio once.  And that song compares the price of fame to castration (moment of my desexing, CUT IT! CUT IT! CUT! CUT! cut this cancer from my soul!) all in a friendly doo wop sing along.  The cd has kind of a feeling of impending doom.  Several songs deal with the negative fallout of our obsession with technology.  The first words on the CD are &quot;Save me&quot;.  Speaking of the future, the song that most directly deals with that subject is None of them Knew..) which is almost like a prediction of how music will sound in the future, but instead of being just heavy, it really swings.  Like doin the Lindy Hop in outer space.  Arse Moriende is more traditional bungle with violins, accordians and lots of percussion playing a sort of Romanian gypsy/Death Metal thing that just keeps accelerating.  My favorite song is &quot;Goodbye Sober Day&quot;.  The chanting part at the end catches everybodies attention.  Lots of Perry and Kingsley style weirdness all over, as well as Smile era Beach Boys influence.  One of my favorite CD's ever, and a good way to introduce somebody into the madness of Mr. Bungle.
B00005OM4N|3.0|The new Britney Spears c.d was a lot diferent then I thought it would be. It is a lot more r &amp; B then Oops...! I did it again was and certainly more then her 1st album. The lyrics have more swears in them, but nothing to be alarmed about. Its probably not a good choice for kids under 10 though. <BR>       Is it good or bad? Its one of those c.ds that you have to listen to a few times before you really understand what the point of the c.d is. Eventually you'll understand that she is trying to say is that people shouldn't look up to her as a role model and shes not a little girl anymore. She wants everyone to know that people her age dress the way she does, and it shouldn't be any diffeent for her. She also explains her frustration about not being able to spend more time with her boyfriend Justin Timberlake. But we can hardly feel bad for her because shes got a lot more then just a few nickles in her pocket,  and shes dating the cutes guy in the world. She also has people waiting on her every second as well as being the person most searched on the internet in 2001. <BR>   So if you buy the album for pitty on her its not a good choice. Buy it because you can look past the image she has bought on to herself or (could this ever happen?) actually like her music.
B00005QDW5|2.0|To much new songs from Gilmore.<br />Why: Brain damage,eclipse,dogs,pigs,mother,two suns in the sunset,.............
B000002L6P|4.0|This is an ok cd but not my favorite from Madonna.The title track<BR>and Material Girl are the best on this cd. If you like those songs get The Immaculate Collection, it has both of those songs plus her other hits.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This limited edition remastered version of Dangerous (one of my personal favs) is a must have for any Jacko fan or someone who loves great pop music.
B000002J1B|5.0|I have been a Yes fan for a while, but only for 90125 album, and the songs Roundabout and I see all good people.  My dad has lots of yes albums (I dont think he has this one) and I never listened to them, just 90125.  <br />Then I went to college, and got internet radio.  I heard many other yes songs.  But when I heard Sound Chaser I was really captivated.  I loved it.  I wanted to hear the other two.  Before long they were on, and I loved them both!  All three songs are non stop pleasure of sound.  <br />This is an awesome album!
B00005QDW5|5.0|Yeah it is... Dave... it's a super idea.  I love Floyd and have loved the Floyd, something I could never avoid.  I've gotten outta the Floyd in recent years... stearing away from the moaning droaning, whoa is me Roger Waters dominated Wall/Final Cut era and concentrated on the classic Dark Side, Animals, and the all brilliant Syd Barrett artistically genius maise days.  I'll never tire of that mat.<br />But anyway... back to that... it's a brilliant compilation of the stuff... a welcoming home mat is that... and the audio is quality great.  Great sequencing... no story of dates just music jumping around throughout their career mixing old in with new and out with the clout.<br />What it is about is their music.  No taxing story of their long accomplished and troubled careers but of the music they made together brother.  Syd is sparced well throughout the compilation and is and always has been in the Pink Floyd android.<br />Whether you know it our not... it's Syd.  The Wall -- Syd... Dark Side -- Syd... Wish You Were Here Syd... and they did... Jugband, probably sums up the entire Blues band man... and it's on this can.<br />PLUS you can not fuss cause it's all on Piper at the Gates and it dawns in the Astronomy Domine and rides to the ends with Bike... and that I really like.
B000002H97|4.0|A new streamlined direction for 'Tallica, good or bad?  Good.  This album has some fantastic songs on it.  Enter Sandman now being a rock classic in the eyes of me and my friends.  Other good songs: Sad But True, the ballad and best song on the album: Unforgiven, the hit but overated Nothing Else Matters and the unbelivably cheesy Of Wolf and Man, a song about werewolves for gawd's sake.  A tight album that's excellently produced.  <br />This streamlining however has ended up with Hammet cutting down his guitar solos, so most last only a minute instead of the usual 4 minute monsters which adorned songs like the amazing Fade to Black.  <br />After a good few years, it seems Lars Ulrich, the drummer, has finally found his cymbals.  Thus, he goes mad with them, pretty much every song intro contains the annoying 'tsh, tsh, tsh' of his hi-hats. <br />No matter, a very good album all the same.  I recommend this if you are new to the band becuase it has a nice balance between rockers and ballads.
0553282980|5.0|We watched the movie in English class.  It was one of the best movies i have ever seen.  I would recomend this movie to anyone.  Please!  If you get the chance, watch this movie!!
0790734850|5.0|a fantastic 50's style mob movie with a brilliant cast, Kevin Spacey being amazing as usual.   A gripping noir movie that balances action with dialogue.  An excellent film.  If you like this, try Goodfellas (the best ever,) Pulp Fiction and Donnie Brasco.
B00005NOOH|5.0|Thorough, outstanding, with no important piece of footage missing, the World at War completely exhausts World War II in documentary form.  A 26 part, 26 hour British production from the 1970s, it does emphasize Britain somewhat more than America (the war in the Pacific is only one of 26 episodes) but the viewer gets a great look at Churchill, and Laurence Olivier's narration is perfect.   The early episodes on the rise of Germany and Japan are telling, and the build-up of the war through the 1930s is spellbinding.  The battle footage from the 1940s - particularly for battles such as Iwo Jima - is stunning.<br />My only beef:  Why did they consider it necessary to interview Alger Hiss as an  &quot;expert&quot; in a final, post-war episode that dishes out benign treatment to the USSR?  It's biased and naive. <br />Ignore episode 26 and watch 1-25 and you'll be mesmerized.
0761536434|5.0|This is a very good book on the entire history of the video game craze up to the present.  Lots of good interviews and tid-bits to  enjoy.  I just wish that I had known that this book is essentially the EXACT SAME BOOK as Kent's other title, &quot;The First Quarter&quot; which was published last year I believe.  It even says this on the title page of this book.  Since I already have that book and have already read it cover to cover, this book really doesn't add much more to the equation.  Still worth reading, though
0385505833|5.0|hi i got this book yesterday afternoon and had it read by lastnight. I never laughed so hard in my life my mom thought i was dying or something. very good book i would recomend it. bye jenny.
B00003CX8I|5.0|When I first heard that a movie of X-Men was being made. I feared that like most other comic based movies. ...I was amazed at how well this film turned out. The characters are all potrayed perfectly (especially Logan) and some such as Toad are even cooler than in the comics. The video is great becuse it features a handful of cut scenes at the end that help explain the plot a bit. ...this vid is a great buy
B00005OM4N|4.0|in a few words, it's a good cd. I like the fact that there's only one really slow song on the album, but the length of the cd is just upsetting. 40 minutes? oh well.<br />Songs That stand out to me :<br />Overprotected, Boys, Cinderella, Bombastic Love, What It's Like To Be Me<br />Justin's vocals help a lot in the last track as do all the computer effects throughout the cd. Good job. Nice to see Britney helped write a few of the songs too.

B00005JKHP|5.0|In December of 1979, when Star Trek The Motion Picture was released, it was apparent to audiences that this was no ordinary \\"shoot 'em up\\" science fiction movie.  This was a serious film with complex plotting and \\"big\\" ideas.  Yet, somehow the film seemed \\"off,\\" and lacked the TV show's charm.  What was not generally known at the time was that, with the premiere date looming and numerous visual effects sequences not completed - and never having had a test screening - director Robert Wise basically assembled what he could and physically carried the print to the film's premiere.  (The final visual effects sequence was literally cut into individual prints of the film before they were express shipped to theaters.)<br /><br />It says something for Wise's ability to work under pressure (he edited Citizen Kane, after all) that, despite mixed reviews, no major critics were able to deduce that they were viewing an unfinished film.  It's also a testament to everyone involved in the project that Star Trek The Motion Picture received Academy Award nominations for Visual Effects and Musical Scoring.  Nevertheless, I remember seeing the film as a 12 year old, and hearing my father complain \\"This film is so slow moving.\\"  And for 22 years, that has been the general consensus - ambitious plotting, great score, mostly good visual effects, poor pacing, little chemistry between the characters.<br /><br />For this DVD issue, Paramount has allowed Robert Wise to do what he wanted to do all along: finish his filme.  Nearly every scene has been reedited - either radically or merely fine tuned - to bring more drama, better pacing, and more emphasis on the characters.  Some of the clunkier bits of dialogue have been excised, along with some unnecessary technobabble.  The new editing also gives greater subtext to the story, and hints at why V'Ger's probe chose to assimilate Lieutenant Ilia rather than, say, Mr. Spock.<br /><br />The new visual effects shots flesh out the movie, adding visual excitement without drawing attention to themselves.  The technicians have even added film grain so that the new shots fit in seamlessly with the originals.  The sound mix is livelier also, with use of some of the original series' sound effects, together with new elements.  Jerry Goldsmith's superb score has been altered to conform with new versions of several scenes, particularly the early exploration of V'Ger.  The score has been edited in such a way that it still makes musical, as well as dramatic, sense.<br /><br />The picture quality is vastly superior to previous VHS issues, and a modest improvement over my widescreen LaserDisc.  Colors and flesh tones are more vibrant, and the image seems sharper overall.  While the film appears to have been cleaned, radical computer \\"scrubbing\\" has not been done, so effects-heavy shots (which were built up element-by-element) show some grain.<br /><br />This new Director's Edition is now the definitive version of Star Trek The Motion Picture.  Retaining all the grandeur of the original, with none of the ponderousness, this is probably the closest realization of Gene Roddenberry's humanistic vision for the future.  After 22 years, The Motion Picture finally takes its rightful place near the top of the Star Trek film canon.excitement without drawing attention to themselves.

B000008H1Y|5.0|This album couldn't have been more of a bigger shock than this one, given their previous release, Too Old To Rock and Roll was basically a disappointment, overly orchestrated, downbeat, and a big self-indulgent mess, so the following release had to be a big improvement if the group was to continue having a great reputation, and it worked. Song From the Woods is a wonderful example of acoustic English folk influenced rock that owes to the likes of Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span. The music here is all upbeat, the strings have all but disappeared, which is a real plus here, not to mention some real nice use of synthesizers (but be aware, A Passion Play with Tull's first album with synths). The lyrics have that wonderful, mystical medieval and Pagan feel to it, not to mention the music itself. Apparently by this time Anderson had moved in to the country, so this album was a result of his move, which must have done the guy some real good. My favorite songs here are the title track, &quot;Cup of Wonder&quot;, &quot;Hunting Girl&quot;, &quot;Velvet Green&quot; and &quot;The Whistler&quot;. This album is a must for all you Anglophiles out there because it sounds VERY English, this album is one great example of a British group exploring roots more at home, rather than trying to sound American with blues and R&amp;B like too many other British bands out there at that time. Jethro Tull would release two more albums in this vein, Heavy Horses and Stormwatch, but I was not nearly as impressed with those two albums as I have with Songs From the Wood. So if you're a Tull fan, grew up on the likes of Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, etc., don't forget to add this one to your collection.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I have learned that the masses are rarely right when it comes to popular music.  Out of all the albums I've purchased (or downloaded off of Morpheus, a.k.a. &quot;purchasing&quot; a CD for college students) this is one of the sub-par discs.  Understand, first off, that I am NOT knocking the band.  Not in the least.  If they really want to play this type of music, write the songs that they do, I totally respect that.  It's just not my thing.  I like the no bull, burn the sugar coating ROCK.  The releases that impressed me most this year, were albums like &quot;Silver Side Up&quot; Nickelback, &quot;Toxicity&quot; S.O.A.D., &quot;Break the Cycle&quot; Staind, &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; O.L.P., and &quot;Lateralus&quot; Tool.  All of these albums were either extremely artistic or just plain good old alt/rock.  &quot;Is this It&quot; is neither.  Reviewers have said of the album, &quot;It's just good rock and roll.&quot;  But it's closer to indie rock or a college album than anything.  The chords are basic.  The melodies are pretty predictable.  None of them are very skilled musicians, and about two or three songs into it, it's BORING.  Very boring.  I've listened to this album about 10 times all the way through, and it's just not for me.  However, if you DO enjoy simplistic rock or if you DO like the Velvet Underground, you will like this.  Download a few songs and THEN determine if you want to purchase it.<br />One last thing, everyone is talking about the Strokes as the &quot;second coming of the Velvet Underground.&quot;  But so what?  It's not like that's really hard to do.  VU was the same way, simplistic, anything but artsy, basic chords, over-hyped, and boring.  I'm a musician myself and I really don't get what the big deal is.
B000002NAK|4.0|If you're like me, then you probably find cast recordings of Evita long and drawn out. Well I've found that this recording flows very smoothly and the music has a nice, slightly updated sound to it. I hear a lot of die hard Evita fans critisice and insult the film version and Modanna and Antonio's talent, but the fact is, this is a good recording and the stars do a fine job
B00005QDW5|4.0|Being a huge Pink Floyd fan I absolutely had to pick this up the first day. Also being an extremely big Pink Floyd fan I already have all of these songs, with the exception of When the Tigers Broke Free on CD.  I bought it because I am a Fan.  The most wonderful part of the CD is how fluidly the music runs together, you get the multiple good songs all together, plus you get the album feel that they always had when there songs run together. To this day I still cannot listen to one song on Dark Side of the Moon, without hearing the next one, except on this where the next song is just as good, and I forget about the next song from DSOTM.  OK this album is not without flaws.  First off I am not in exact agreement over the tracks selected, but of course it would be impossible to get a set list that everyone would agree on, but I do feel, and I think most people would agree that Sheep was selected off of Animals because it is shorter then the better song Dogs, and Don't forget albums completely getting the shaft like More, Obscured by Clouds, and Atom Heart Mother.  Either Cymbaline and or Green is the Colour should have been on this from More, and many songs from Obscured such as Childhoods End, Free Four, Wot's uh the Deal, and Mudmen should have made it, and Summer 68, or If from Atom Heart Mother could have easily made it in my Opinion, But I won't complain about the album or give the album a bad review because of the track selection, but rather I will drop it by 1 star because the real problems. Echoes the track that they took the name of is brutally cut short by nearly 7minutes. And the 8:50 intro to Shine On You Crazy Diamond is cut to only 7:50, and I absolutely hate that they only put an excerpt of Marooned on the album, if you felt like the song is too long then don't add it, but don't cut it short, it sounds odd and out of place on the album.  All in all the songs alone should speak for the album itself, and I know that the album would never be able to fully satisfy me because there is no good way to make a good Pink Floyd Best Of CD, the is the best one of the lot.
B00005OM4N|5.0|I knew when I heard I'm a Slave 4 U this would be one of her best albums yet. I love all the songs on this CD and beleive that four of them will be number one hits by mid summer 2002. She really shines with her voice. It has definately matured and the pop rap is cool to in &quot;Boys&quot;. Britney Lovers Beware, I saw her first. :)
B00003CXZ4|5.0|&quot;Wow&quot; is the only word to describe this movie.  I have finally seen &quot;Memento&quot;, and now I know that it's not pure hype; this movie is outstanding!  This is one of my new favorite movies.  If you like movies that make you think (&quot;Fight Club,&quot; &quot;Unbreakable&quot;), then you will love this movie.<br />I will be quick and brief when I describe this movie, because this is another movie where you have to be careful on how you explain it or you'll give it away.  Leonard seems to be an ordinary man, but he's not.  He has a certain condition where he is unable to create new memories.  If he talks to someone too long, he will forget what he was talking about and whom he was talking to.  Leonard has an agenda in mind; to find and kill the person who raped and murdered his wife.  Leonard can remember everything before the &quot;incident,&quot; but he cannot remember anything new.  So he takes pictures of people to remember them and he tattoos important information all over on his body so he will remember things.  As his quest for vengeance continues, the more the twists and surprises come about.  Just when you think you know everything, you don't.<br />This movie was brilliantly directed.  The events in the movie are backwards and brief, which sort of gives us an idea of what the main character is going through.  All though you do not see a lot of actors in the film, the ones who are in it deliver top-notch performances.  Guy Pearce did an outstanding job and was the best actor in the movie.  The screenplay was mesmerizing and made the characters seem that more realistic.  There are a few extras on the DVD, but it would've been nice to have a few more in there, as always.<br />There are no guarantees that you will like this film.  Since this is such a unique film, it means that only certain people will like it.  I think it's worth viewing and even if you do not like the film, I think you'll admire how it was done.  Hey, I hated &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; but even I can appreciate how it was filmed and directed.  If you don't want a film that's going to make you think, then don't see it.  If you want more action than story, don't see it.  Otherwise, give it a shot!  Since Leonard is so dependent on facts, here's a couple for you that will help you out during the movie:<br />FACT 1:  Pay close attention to the movie.  If I were you, I wouldn't take any breaks.  If you do, you might forget what has happened, and you'll lose the rhythmic flow of the movie.<br />FACT 2:  Nothing is what it seems.  Make sure you pay attention to every character and every conversation that takes place.<br />FACT 3:  Re-watch the movie.  This is the type of movie that likes to screw around with your brain!  You are very likely to be confused the first time around, but the second time should be a little more clearer.<br />This is a remarkable film and is an excellent thriller that outdoes most films.  Who are Leonard's friends and foes?  Who can he trust?  What is real and what is not?  You'll find that out soon when you see it.  &quot;Memento&quot; shows you that some memories are best forgotten.  What a spectacular movie!!e,&quot; but even I can appreciate how it was filmed and directed.  If you don't want a film that's going to make you think, then don't see it.

B000000HU1|5.0|I can't think of a better way for Gong to close the Radio Gnome trilogy as You. You shows Gong at their absolute best. Never had I heard Steve Hillage, Didier Malherbe, Pierre Moerlin, and Tim Blake play better than they had on this album. This is by far Gong's most instrumental album in their Daevid Allen days, as there is tons of absolutely killer jams. &quot;A Sprinkling of Clouds&quot; is simply one of the best Gong songs I have ever heard, with tons of great, spacy synths, lots of guitar jams, and at the end, killer bamboo flute courtesy of Didier Malherbe. For me this was one of the greatest space rock albums I have ever heard. Unfortunately Daevid Allen, Tim Blake, and Gilli Smyth left after this album leaving the band to turn to a less interesting direction. This album was what people listened to before there were such groups like Ozric Tentacles. If you're a lover of space rock, you should not go without this album.
B000001GPX|5.0|I heard this on my public radio station in my car. I had to stop driving and turn it up. When I'm down and tired of the rat race, or when I feel glad to be alive, I put this CD on and it has never failed to fill me with a fresh exhilaration. I love this recording! Kleiber and the Orchestra are magnificent!
6301773551|5.0|This movie started it all. Nothing can really compare to A New Hope. While it may not be the best in the series, it's certainly the most exciting and magical. Remember how you felt the first time you saw Darth vader or a Stormtrooper? I do, this movie still brings me joy after more than 20 years. You just gotta love it
B00005QDW5|5.0|In the 34 years since Pink Floyd first entered a recording studio, there has never been an adequate compilation, and to a certain extent this is no exception. Of course all the classic material is on there, but there is only one track which has not appeared on an album anywhere else, and that is &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot;. Admittedly, this is even a different version to the one which appeared on 45 back in the early 80s, so that is something of a breakthrough. But the early years are somewhat sadly neglected.<br />Where, for example, are the single-only releases, &quot;Apples And Oranges&quot;, &quot;Point Me At The Sky&quot; and &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot;. I have been looking and I can't find any of these on CD anywhere. This would have been the ideal opportunity.<br />Also sadly neglected are the movie scores, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot;. When taken in context against the backdrop of the truly monumental studio albums, these were very definitely 'minor league', but there were some great songs on those albums.<br />While it is odd to hear some of the tracks on this collection out of context, the whole thing is extremely well-balanced. But there was a reason why &quot;Shine On&quot; was split over the beginning and end of the &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; album, and that is made apparent here. Patching the two sections together sounds strange after all these years.<br />Everyone will have their own opinions about what consitutes &quot;The Best Of Pink Floyd&quot; and it would be surprising if two lists matched up, but this is an extremely good cross-section of the Floyd's meisterwerks.<br />The sleeve notes state that the compilation was produced by James Guthrie and Pink Floyd. Does this mean that they've finally settled their differences? It would be nice to think so, because as compilations go there isn't a single weak track on this entire set. But although this rates 5 stars, I'm not going to get rid of my copy of &quot;Relics&quot; just yet.
0553106635|5.0|George R. R. Martin's masterful tales of royal intrigue are a relieving respite from the works of Robert Jordan.  The development of each character and their cultural influences are a treat to the mind.<BR>   I highly recommend this series to any reader, young and old.  I must say, it is my favorite, and maybe it'll become yours too.
0380715430|4.0|If you just read &quot;A Walk In the Woods&quot; and you're wanting to read more Bill Bryson, this one may throw you for a bit of a loop.  Yes, it has some of his characteristic wit and even a bit of hilarity, but it also goes into thorough detail of English usage and origin.  After some introductory chapters, the book begins to read more like a college text. Not that I wouldn't wish more textbooks would be written with the skill and clarity that Bryson brings to a subject obviously close to his heart. Don't expect &quot;The Mother Tongue&quot; to read like a travelogue.
B00005OM4N|4.0|This is a way good CD! Much better them Oops. Even if you don't like Britney her new sound is great. it is great buy.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is one of the most surprisingly brilliant and funny movies of 2001, and can't be missed on DVD!  The deleted scenes are great, and the two behind-the-scenes documentaries are quite interesting (the way the young director was found and hired; the selling of the author's first novel, the pain of having to find just the RIGHT blonde shade for Reese's hair, etc.)  <br />The studio has wisely split the extras up on to two sides of the DVD, so that everything can be easily played on any DVD player (some DVD players have trouble playing DVD's that have too much compressed information on them).  <br />There's also pop-up trivia that comes up that tells you all about the making of the movie, history of cast and crew, etc.  (You can turn this function off if you just want to watch the regular movie.)  As far as the movie goes- Reese Witherspoon turns in yet another spectacular performance.  Is she America's new sweetheart?  Why, yes!  I think she is!  This movie was sort of marketed as a stupid, mindless comedy- which is a shame because it's not really that at all.  This movie has got a lot of heart and hilarity- great story, acting, EVERYTHING is perfect.  Jennifer Coolidge turns in yet another HILARIOUS performance (check her out in &quot;Best Of Show&quot; is you haven't seen that)- she should be a major comedic star soon!
630575067X|2.0|What the heck was Lucas thinking when he decided to make this movie? (...) This is a pitiful excuse for a Star Wars movie. Lucas really should have quit while he was ahead. This movie has SO many problems. bad casting, bad acting by the child stars, horrible characters like Jar Jar and Darth Maul. Under developed plot AND an over developed plot (only Lucas could screw up on both counts) He tries to cram too much into this movie. I mean what are the chances that Darth Vader built C-3P0. He totally killed the magic of the force and annoyed the heck out of everyone by having the characters over explain everything. Ant the worse thing, The fact that Lucas used toilet humor in this movie. The only good to come of this movie is the soundtrack, the podrace, and the lightsabre fight. The rest of the movie is really lame
B00005OM4N|5.0|this is my fave brit CD ever because it is really a Britney thing and she wrote alot of the songs...BRITNEY ROX!!!!
B00005QDW5|5.0|The best of Pink Floyd is called The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Obscurred by Clouds and Animals (in no particular order) and their other albums are great also. This is a good compilation of music, but when I listen to it I always wind up taking it out and putting the original album in. The great thing about this release though is that it will introduce some of the best music ever made to some new listeners. To really experience Pink Floyd you need to get the original releases.
B00002ZZJI|5.0|Eric Clapton<br />One of the more important guitarists in rock history, Eric Clapton has over the years become the most reluctant of guitar heroes. This makes choosing his best albums a dual task of seeking out particularly thrilling displays of his instrumental prowess as well as acknowledging the other talents he brings to the table as a credible singer, a fine songwriter, and an immensely gifted interpreter of others' songs.
B00000IPAX|1.0|i got the australian only cd which includes 3songs live, two of which are from dude ranch, and they're the only good songs on this cd.(this cd stands for crap disc) how can anyone say that this is punk? there are two 'versions' of punk, one being anarchy (sex pistols) and the other being fast and hard, and this doesn't fall into either of them. it's just crap. this cd is suitable to kids(...), not for punks.
B00005OM4N|4.0|To say the least, the pop world is a growing market full of one hit wonders and top hits. One female leads the pack...Miss Britney Spears. She busted to the scene with ''..baby one more time'' and hit us back with a strong album: ''Oops!.. I did it again''---now she is busting at the seams with ''BRITNEY''. The openeing track with a top hit video, Slave 4 U is a stylish hit, but one of the lesser grade tracks; to put it mildly, BRITNEY surpasses many in a lot of ways. The song OVERPROTECTED  garners her onslaught in the advancement of state of the art synthesizers as do a few other golden tracks---CINDERELLA, WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME(which speaks the rules of a relationship played by ''my game/my rules''), BOMBASTIC LOVE, and a surprisingly good janet-esque song ANTICIPATING...a true groove is a nasty cut about freaking on the dance floor similar in style but better than''slave''  is BOYS.There is much to say, but this album can only be mildly put into words---Great sounds, vocals and a twist of fun(with the help of soul savant Rodney Jerkins, Dido, and Justin Timbelake---this album is sure to hit #1 and last, proving that Britney, well enjoys the ride and doesn't need a reason why, but as long as she makes great albums like this, she'll be around for a long time to come---Recommended for most ages--1 swearword in overprotected the ''d'' word (hint--holds water)---so sit back! listen! and enjoy!
B00005OM4N|3.0|Talk about someone who knows how to ruin a song.Her remake of \\"I Love Rock N Roll\\" has two be the worst remake in history.Joan Jetts growls have been reduced to moans by Britney.The rest of the music is just her forst two albums recycled into an over blown mess.\\"Im a Slave For You\\"Is a complete (...) of \\"Nasty Girl\\" by Vanity 6.Could this be the end of Britney?If she continues to churn out music like this,we can say so.Nice try Brit,better luck next time.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears is now so high-concept, such a distillation of what made pop singers like Paula Abdul, Janet Jackson and Madonna so fabulously marketable, that her third record, Britney, is a concept album about herself.She's &quot;Overprotected.&quot; She's &quot;Lonely.&quot; She's &quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman.&quot; Britney just wants to be Britney, this self-reflexive CD reasons, even as everyone around her is feverishly constructing &quot;Britney&quot; the product.<br />Just as Abdul was a choreographer who sang and Madonna is a performance artist who makes music, this former Mouseketeer is a nice actress playing the part of a bubblegum icon intent on being teasingly naughty. Never has a female star courted the preteen and trench-coat crowds so simultaneously and shamelessly. Although she at first appeared to be choking back psychological pain while executing coy dance moves and signature guttural gasps, Spears now seems like she's in on and enjoying the joke scripted for her. And just as Janet Jackson claimed Control while aspiring to adulthood, Spears aches to put her own authorial stamp on the &quot;Britney&quot; story. <br />Despite Britney's five co-songwriting credits, her music is ultimately driven by producers who must work around her vocal limitations. But an identity is now asserting itself: Britney is by far her most personable album, the most consistently playful and the least wince-inducing. Producer Rodney Jerkins' hip-hop blaspheming of Joan Jett's &quot;I Love Rock 'n' Roll&quot; doesn't go as far as it should (is a Limp Bizkit remix in its future?), but it certainly beats what her earlier studio architects did to those Sonny and Cher and Stones songs.<br />Although they're not the album's most melodious cuts, the Neptunes' &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Boys&quot; could be Britney's most important. This ultra-hot hip-hop duo feeds Prince's girl group Vanity 6 (&quot;Nasty Girl&quot;), Rick James' female foursome the Mary Jane Girls (&quot;Boys&quot;), and Jam and Lewis' pivotal Janet production (&quot;Nasty&quot;) into their own studio machine. The resulting montage of 1980s-R&amp;B male fantasies clings bizarrely close to its sources while feeding Spears avant-soul beats designed to carry her into twenty-first-century urban adulthood. It works: The &quot;get it, get it&quot; chant of &quot;Slave&quot; delivers classic &quot;Britney&quot;-ness, while &quot;Boys&quot; whips out a surprisingly tuneful bridge that dramatically rescues an estrogen-dripping but otherwise negligible song.<br />Swedish teen-pop pioneer Max Martin and partner Rami reunite for tracks that link the international, kid-friendly sound of Spears' previous album, Oops! . . . I Did It Again, to her recent American R&amp;B update. &quot;Overprotected,&quot; &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; bear the expected monster choruses, familiar modulations and emotionally impulsive lyrical themes. Yet their grooves are sharper and their arrangements have more sonic twinkle. Once you get beyond its cringeworthy title, &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot; supplies the weighty ballad Spears has craved and can now handle. Co-written by Dido, Martin and Rami, the track ruminates with sophisticated chords that complement the prefab sleaze and calculated rebellion elsewhere on the album.<BR>Jerkins' other productions, &quot;Lonely&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be,&quot; improve upon his previous contributions to the teen-pop canon (Spice Girls, 'NSync). He is compositionally teamed with Josh Schwartz and Brian Kierulf, unheralded third-tier teen-pop producers (Aaron Carter, LFO, 2gether) who here transcend their filler-supplying status, particularly with the tracks they produce themselves. Spears usually puts on her cutesy, ironic &quot;Material Girl&quot; actor voice when she's not channeling understated Janet bravado, but on &quot;Anticipating,&quot; a euphoric Rick Astley flashback, and &quot;That's Where You Take Me,&quot; a sincere electro-ballad, she emotes without framing her vocals in Nickelodeon-schooled theatricality. Sugary and sparkly in a great way, these are the unexpected baubles that make the album more than a sonic Spears infomercial.<BR>Still, Britney belabors the obvious: Spears is one month away from entering her twenties and clearly needs to grow up if she's going to bring her fans along. Her Lolita shtick is nearly past its expiration date, and the growing pains presented throughout the album too often come across as contrived. While she's envisioning herself as a renegade fairy-tale princess, other gals her age are contemplating college majors, contraception and motherhood. America itself has aged abruptly over the past two months, perhaps too quickly for &quot;Britney,&quot; Britney or even Britney. Time will tell whether any of her incarnations remain relevant in an era that's suddenly not that innocent.
B00005OWIU|5.0|When I bought this CD I wasn't sure if they were actual songs with words, or just music. It turned out to be just music, but I was not dissapointed in the slightest! Actually though, there is one track &quot;Christmas at Hogwarts&quot; that has some words. The music composed and conducted  John Williams is just magical. The music for specific scenes like &quot;The Chess Game&quot; and &quot;The Invisibility Cloak and Library Scene&quot; make you feel the mood of the scene, it's great! I LOVE the whole CD! Most of the songs play the familiar tune over and over again in different tones and with different instruments. &quot;Da Da Da Da Daa daaa Daa, daa da da daa da daaaa&quot; LOL. I LOVE IT.. if your a HP fan, BUY IT!  *&lt;   :)
B00004STPT|5.0|The original soundtrack of Gladiator is far better than any other version from it.  It is my first movie sound track I rushed to buy so soon.  Just as good as Brave Heart.<BR>The same feelings I get when I watch the movie are the same feelings I get when I listen to the CD.  <BR>The same strong chills strike me again and again when I hear my favorite track Now We Are Free because that is exactly how I feel when I here it.  The songs dramatizes the different ways us humans feel in life.  My over-all feelings of the cd is a peacefull awakness to this life.  I only wish the albumn<BR>carried the lyrics, to the last two tracks especially.
0316776963|5.0|It is very rare that I laugh out loud whilst reading.  I laughed out loud several times while reading this book--read it in one day.  Only people who have no sense of humor would not enjoy it.  It is wonderful.  I wished I had read it more slowly, but I couldn't stop myself.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ok...I know that Britney may not have the BEST voice in the world, but I can't deny that her music makes me happy and is just plain fun.  Her new cd is awesome...I just bought it today and I haven't stopped listening to it.  I really like &quot;Boys&quot; b/c it has sort of an R&amp;B feel. And of course I love &quot; I'm a slave for you.&quot; This is the best cd yet from Britney!
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the greatest album of all time, from the greatest band of all time, with the greatest song of all tme(Smells Like Teen Spirit.) Kurt Cobain is my hero. He was a genuis. If only people understood what he was trying to say, he would still be around today.

This movie, sure it does follow the mode, but it goes up and beyond it with its amazing effects and disguised storyline. plus hale berry.....I mean come on!
B00005MNP8|4.0|Blondie's best album, full of melodic post-punk pop confections. Blondie had some individual highlights before and after, but never so many on one album. The &quot;Once I Had a Love&quot; bonus track is a funky, chunky live version of the song that later became &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;.

B00000K2UX|5.0|Great CD!  Lot's of spunky `80's songs, from a great movie.  Great for cruising in a convertible with the top down, or bopping around the house on the weekend.<br />We got the CD for my daughter, Rebecca, who is severely handicapped (cerebral palsy).  She's 6 and has had a crush on Tom Cruise for over a year now!  She watches the video during her hyperbaric oxygen therapies and still gets excited about Tom, as well as the action scenes.  (Read Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy - Dr.'s Neubauer and Walker).  <br />And, she bops around in the car with the CD on the way home from therapies.
B00005JG6R|4.0|I just bought this item and was surprised to find that this is a wide screen edition 1:1.75
B00005N9CV|4.0|Smooth, sexy, and seductive. With its quality song selection, sympathetic arrangements and accompaniment, and Krall's own languid and smoky vocals, this is the contemporary equivalent of some of those great jazz bossa nova LPs of the early 1960s. Fabulous sound quality adds to the pleasure.
055321263X|3.0|Walter Hartright first meets this mysterious woman while walking along a deserted road; she was a solitary, unusual woman who is dressed from head to foot in white garments.  He talks with her and then she disappears.<br />In this way the Woman in White begins.  It is a fascinating mystery novel full of twists and turns, mistaken identities, and surprise revelations.<br />I loved this book and the investigating that Walter Hartright does, after his first encounter with the woman in white, to uncover her identity.<br />This book was a bit dated in parts, but overall a strange, eerie mystery tale that is well worth reading.  It deserves 3 1/2 stars.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|I waited for one month in great expectation of the DVD verson of Shrek.  There were games and other cool features on this two disk set that I couldn't wait to tear into.  Looks like lots of fun, right?  Pretty disapointing.  The cool games won't run off the DVD player on your TV.  You have to have a PC running Windows 98, an internet connection and a DVD rom.  We all have internet connection with our computers, and most of us have CD- roms on our computers.  But I doubt that all the people who buy this DVD will have computers with DVD players.  And while I have one that does, it's a Mac.  No good.  <BR> On the other hand, there's still a lot to enjoy on the DVD verson.  There are two versons of the movie(formatted and widescreen) behind the scenes footage, and other interesting stuff.  I really haven't looked at everything yet, and while it's worth the price, it doesn't deliver on the interactive games.  Guess I got burned . . . I'll know better next time.
B00005QDW5|5.0|The way that they produced this album with the tracks weaved in and out makes this a tremendous record and one of the best floyd albums i have ever heard....if u are a floydian fan, u must own this cd !
B00005NB0H|5.0|The first disc is the recently-reissued expanded version of the classic fire-and-brimstone &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; concert recording. The second disc is a thunderingly-great complete recording of &quot;Tommy&quot; from the same concert. It's good to have a live recording of &quot;Tommy&quot; from when it was new and not yet a lumbering dinosaur. I'm not sure it's worth the price, though, if you already have the remastered &quot;Live at Leeds&quot; CD. Who die-hards will need this, others must make an economic decision.
B00005O5CM|5.0|As a blonde sorority girl currently enrolled in a top law school, I had to see this movie.  I found Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Coolidge to be hilarious.  If you're looking for a fun, fluffy movie to watch, this is it!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I was so excited about Britney Spears new album to come out.  And let me tell you my excitement paid off! When I put this CD into my player...I fell in love instantly.  This CD is a must for Britney Spears fans and everyone alike.  This album goes to show that Britney Spears is here to stay and she won't be shown down by anyone else.  This CD contains the huge 1st single, &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; (The song that started the change of Britney's sound).  It also contains &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman,&quot; a beautiful ballad that will be Spears 2nd single and also her 3rd dance hit single &quot;Overprotected.&quot; This album is a great taste of pure Dance Pop! &quot;Britney&quot; is definately worth the money that you paid for.  You will not be disapointed! And besides, she is the best selling female artist and a beautiful one at that!
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie is fast, adventurous, supenseful the whole chi-bang. Since it brought a new style to  the show biz industry that many directors use in movies and television shows. I can watch this movie a billion times and not get sick of it. Its a great movie for parties because it has everything people like.
B00005RHGK|5.0|With its scary theme tune, monster villian and the two stupid leads characters , even before the film starts you know you are in for one hellishly scary film! IGNORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS...CONCENTRATE ON THE POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!!!!!!!<br /> Our two siblings Trish [GINA PHILIPS] and Darry [JUSTIN LONG] are on the way home from one of the worst road trips of their life! Boared out of their lives, they play a game to spot out hidden messages in cars license plates and on one spooky vehicle, the license plate reads ''BEATINGU'' [get it?!?!]. After they are almost run off the road by this ''maniac'', they spot ''the creeper'' dumping what looks like a body down a a sewage pipe! And in time hounored fashion, they go back to the abonded church where the body was placed. After one head trip of a thrill in the titular church, they head back to town yet the creeper is hungry and is peckish for a certain ''snack'' from one of the clueless teens....<br />It is obvious that director VICTOR SALVA would like a JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 and so will the blood hungary teens who were taught the slasher survival skills from SCREAM 1,2 AND 3. There are understated performances from our Trish and Darry.There are cheap looking effects straight from B movie hell yet there is still fun to be had from this movie which is not your average SCREAM clone. Watch out for the shocking,horrible and satircal ending!! It catches you unawares just like the creeper!

0871137380|5.0|The author has no military background. That is his advantage. That is his talent. He is able to write about what it is like to be in combat without seeing through the military-trained mind.  A superb novel of real-men in a modern-type war. Thank you, Mark. You have prepared future warriors for their war.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Some critics have compared Muse to Radiohead and even Coldplay? However this latest album is sure to shake off that image with this latest installment in what I hope will be a long chain of albums. The album opens with the single New Born, beginning with a gentle piano part , before another piano and Matt Bellamy's vocals joins in, giving the impression of a gentle, indie piece. Not So, however, for after a brief pause, a strongly defiant, hard guitar riff begins and strangely enough, Bellamy sings the same tune to this radically different backing vocals. This is a classic. It mixes Muses's blend of indie and grunge with piano music that seems to have classical influences. Next up is Bliss which also begins with gentle music, this time a harp, before the guitars and vocals join in. Bellamy shows his talent as a singer by going into incrediably high falsetto which many people counld not attempt. It finishes with the gentle harp. Space Dementia begins with the sought of piano music you'd expect in a Beethovan concert. It takes about 45 seconds before the guitar and vocals join in. Throughout the verse the piano plays arpeggios in the background to the lines I love all the dirty tricks\And twisted games you play\On me. The music then breaks down into something soft yet strange for the chorus, while Bellamy uses a voice machine, before the music degenerates into a hard finale riff. Very experimental, but excellent. The beginning of Hyper Music is some s being scratched horribly before a bum bum, ba-ba ba bum, typical of some'cool' driving music. This then dies down before the vocals start in Bellamy's usual style, except a bit more..lively than usual. The bum bum... then resurfaces and dies down again. When the bum bum... is playing Bellamy sings in a more rocky style. A new type that I hope to see more of. Plug In Baby, another single reminds me intensely of Muscle Museum from the first album. This is a great song, universeally appealing and it is worth buying the album just for this and New Born. Typically the verse is slightly softer than the chorus, which is very fast. If you liked showbiz then you'll love Plug In Baby, its the song that got me into Muse. Citizen Erased begins with the bum bum.. of Hyper Music before the other instruments join in. This song once again includes the expected high falsetto before before dying down for the chorus verse bridge. The verse is very soft, possibly the softest yet. It finishes with the lyrics Erase all the memories\ They'll only bring us pain+\ And I've seen all I need to see, in a beutiful ending to an epic piece. Micro Cuts is almost as joyous and uplifting as The Intense Humming Of Evil by the Manic Street Preachers. It has gothic guitars backing collosaly high vocalsm, which makes it one of the bleakest songs ever. Screenager begins with a discordant guitar solo backed only by some strange instrument which I cannot identify, nothing else, save the vocals, join in for the verse, and only a keyboard for the rest of the song. It is fairly bleak, but as not as much as Micro Cuts. Darkshines is more upbeat (a little) and begins with a fairly singular guitar solo. This however breaks into the familiar style when the chorus. it is a refreshing breath after the last two songs and shows the standard of all Muse's music. It finishes with lementing latin guitars, before the chorus strikes up again with the vocals being shouted. Feeling Good is a cover of a jazz tune but is made anew with great guitar riffs and vocals. Final track Megalomania is a slow track to the backing of a guitar, untill the chorus when it all speeds up to provide a great canvas to the vocals, before slowing down again for the verse. All in all an excellent album, one of the best.
0345403959|5.0|Belgarath.  One simple word.  A word that means so much.  To an ordinary man, Belgarath is nothing.  To an Eddings fan, Belgarath is everything.  From the start of the Belgariad, through to the end of the Malloreon, he was there, as were you...the reader.  This book is an &quot;answer all questions&quot; type of read.  It's basically the tale of how he became the figure that he currently is.  It begins early in life and progresses through many, many years of EVENTS.  Encounters with Aldur, Beldin, Polgara, Chamdar and of course Torak are all chronicled.  The significance of many of the EVENTS are explained.  The style in which the book is written captivates you from the start.  It is indeed a page-turner filled with sadness, anger, joy, and even humour.  The autobiographical feel was also something appealing.  Belgarath even hints at who really runs the world, and his opinion gets you thinking.  Mr. Eddings has done it again and I look forward to any future works of his, as all his past are masterpieces.  If you've even wondered &quot;why?&quot; acquire this book. If you've ever wondered &quot;who?&quot; acquire this book.  Or, if you just want a good read, acquire this book and you'll see why the Eddings duo are the true sorcerers of the literary world.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This is an outstanding compilation. Pink Floyd is of course an &quot;album&quot; oriented band, but they manage to pull off the &quot;best of&quot; title with the tracks delivered here. My only complaints are that &quot;Echoes&quot; isn't the complete 23 minute version, instead we get a 16 minute edition. It's too bad the band didn't find a way to include that entire song, as it is probably their best ever, and is after all, the song the cd itself is named for. I think some of the other tunes are edited as well, though i'm not sure. Also, where in the world is &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;??!! One of their most popular and biggest hits is mysteriously absent. Other than that, this is one of the better albums you'll see this year.
B00005LMBK|2.0|After hearing the singles off this album, I thought that Gorrilaz was going to be something special, to my dissapointmeant however, it wasn't.<BR> The album opens with Re-Hash, it is a flat, unisnteresting track and I would never go out off my way to listen to it. It's only use is as background music, though I can name any number of songs better suited to this purpose.<BR> 5/4 is quite good, however it is very similar to just about all of Blur's post Parklife, pre 13 music,it clearly should have been the fourth single. <BR> Tommorrow Comes Today is very good, though. It has a pleasant harmonium in the background and only uses drums apart fromthat. However this is very supporting of Albarn's voice.<BR> New Genious is rather dull and depressing, it has no variation in pitch and songs like it are what make Gorrilaz a bad album.<BR> However all spirits are lifted when the excellent Clint Eastwood comes in. This wonderful (even the rap is ok) track shows what amazing potential Gorrilaz have, whick I hope they fuffil with their next album.<BR> Ditto the statements used about New Genious for Man Research, the guitars are slightly more interesting.<BR> Punk is a repulsant song. If it's intent was to satarise the punk genre with short, fast, unvaried music and loud vocals which you can't understand, then it has done very well. Otherwise it is one of the worst songs ever written.<BR> Sound check is nothing new, it's just a downbeat version of 'There's No Other Way' by Blur. 'nough said.<BR> Double Bass has no vocals and just repeats. I fail to understand how anyone could enjoy this.<BR>  Rock The House is only for people who enjoy the down market end of rap. I don't even like the up market end.<BR> 19-2000 is one of the few good songs, like Clint Eastwood it reveals Gorrilaz's full potential.<BR> If you like hip-hop and latin music (not the Ricky Martin sort, the slow sort) then Latin Smoke is for you. Unfortunately most people don't.<BR> Starshine is yet another slow, dull,repetetive song, however it is slightly better than the others.<BR> Slow Country is just slow country music. The bad sort.<BR> M1 A1 is just someone saying &quot;Hello. Is Anyone there?&quot; in a funny voice to the sound of guitars. Then the main tune kicks in which is similar to Blur's 'Parklife', so this song is better than most on the album.<BR> The remixes of Cint Eastwood and 19-2000 are just faster versions. They are fun, but nothing special. All in all, I think Gorrilaz can be summed up by the actions of a friend of mine. After buying the album and listening to the opening tracks, he skipped to Clint Eastwood and pressed the repeat button.
B0000060LT|5.0|This album was first played to me in a Cinema Studies class as support to the 1928 silent film 'The Wind'. A strange but effective choice considering the film's desert themes and the album's oceanic ones. The album has a loose structure, an improvised feel as the musicians grant themselves the freedom to play like its their last, their intimate knowledge of each other's style directing them effortlessly through this sublime musical trip. I have a special place in my heart for this album but happily concede that it is a little self-indulgent. Some of these tracks extend to around 14 minutes as the musicians' melancholic joy is shamelessly unleashed. And hey, who am I to judge indulgence of this calibre?? A beautiful, mesmerising album if you like it slow and sincere.

Obviously a great movie on several accounts- one of Ridley Scott's best; very good perf.<BR>by Russell Crowe;excellent digital rendering of Rome &amp; coliseum; well staged action sequences.<BR>I have found that the DVD package definitely lives up to the scope of the film. I just wish I had the full 6.1 DTS system to match it.
B00005KFUN|5.0|This summer I took a trip to France, and I went to the Virgin Records Mega Store. While I was shopping they began to play 'New Born' by Muse. I stopped dead in my tracks and directed my eyes to the giant screen on which the video was playing. I couldn't believe it. The sound was amazing, the video was innovating. I bought the CD on the spot. It was the best CD that I have ever bought, especially considering it was an impulse buy. I can't get tired of it. They haven't really heard of Muse in the United States but I played the CD for my friend, and his exact words were &quot;this is amazing&quot;. Muse is hard to describe in just one word. I reccommend this CD to everyone. They have the sounds of Silverchair, but are much better. This is the future of music. Rock on.
630416923X|5.0|When the Anthology came to TV and &quot;Free As A Bird&quot; was played, it was tear gathering experience.  It was a time of healing, first healing the experience of the Beatles breaking up, then Lennon and McCartney never heard together again, and then the death of John Lennon which closed the chapter for ever on a Beatle reunion.  Anthology was excellent!  This was a documentary that was told by all four Beatles in a mature and intelligent manner without their wacky sense of humor in it.  They took this serious and showed people that they were proud to be the greatest group of all time.  Even though John is dead, somehow he was able to come from his grave and give a few words to it through old videos and recordings.  If John were asked, in spirit, about the Anthology, he would have been delighted.  For John, it wasn't stupid and Beatlelish, it was real, and that is what John Lennon was always angry about, realism.  For Paul, at the end of this series, he plainly explained why the Beatles broke up, &quot;It is like when the war is over, you are through fighting, you say good-bye, go home, and have a family, well that is what the Beatles had to do, go home and have a family.&quot; Watch this film, it is well worth it.
0373834454|5.0|There can be no dearth of fun with Heyer books. But this one beats them all for the hilarious set of madcap sidekick charcters that heyer has brought in.

B00005QFE5|5.0|What Zhang Yimou can do with a hundred grand and a beautiful woman and a camera and landscape is uncanny.  Hollywood filmmakers MUST cringe in envy when they watch movies such as The Road Home, because in their high-budget bliss they nor their actors cannot do what Zhang and his cast often do: offer real blood and real tears nakedly.  <br />The majority of Chinese students in China I have spoken to who have seen The Road Home expressed nothing short of disgust for the movie, which I do not find surprising, given their general affinity for all things Arnold. It took hundreds of millions of dollars and Leonardo DiCaprio to convince young people in the Mainland that the complexities of love can be overcome by will alone.  So when a low-budget (by American standards) movie is released about a young woman, a schoolhouse in Northern China, a pair of school teachers, and a funeral march - all of which remind them only of things that have become taboo, things they'd like to forget ever occurred - they dismiss it passionately. <BR>Meanwhile, grown men like myself are reduced to tears at the reminder that love can be so torturous, and no less complex in the countryside than in New York City.  I am left with two distinct images from that movie: the pottery fixer rambling from village to village in the cold, fixing Di's bowl with spit, staples, and ties; and Di frantically pursuing horse and carriage departing the town.  There was never such longing in the world; you never ran like this.
0385484518|5.0|I think Tuesdays with Morrie is an awesome book and is very heartwarming. I hop e you love it too.
B00005OM4N|1.0|ok i've heard the album a day before it was released. and i'm sorry but that cd was boring. i'll admit that 'i'm a slave 4 u' was a good song. it's the ONLY good song on the WHOLE cd. i got tired listening to the songs. they all sound very much alike and all sound dumb. she still has that 'little girl' sound that i never liked. but to all you britney fans, you'll probably like it. sounds just like her other cd's. but if you really want some quality music i wouldn't buy this cd. well that's just my opinion.
B00000BKDY|5.0|Simply put, the best metal album made by any band, anywhere, at any time.  It will never be matched. Period.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Well, I admit it, we can't help but be a slave for brit! Especially with this cd! I am a VERY skeptical Britney Fan, don't get me wrong, I have all her cd's to date &amp; I've been to her concerts, but I'm still trying to figure out her image. In the beginning of her career, her personality &amp; sweetness set her apart for sure~  but now, since the slave 4 u single was released and the new promotion for this cd, Brit seems to have just evolved into a more suggestive portrayed artist. This is the only thing that bothers me~ she has given in to the demands of selling sexuality nowadays &amp; its defintiley not appropriate for our little ones to see or hear. But who can lie, honestly, guys love her becuz she's Britney &amp; we know what that's about &amp; gurls love her, well becuz, sure, we all in some weird way want to be like her &amp; admire her great figure, etc. Songs I liked on this cd were: *I'm a Slave 4 U  *Lonely  *boys  *anticipating  *cinderella~ sadly enuff, I really hated the rendition of &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot; by Joan Jett, who made that song what it is. On her last album, Britney did a good job of reinventing &quot;Satisfaction&quot; by Jagger! No doubt about that. But this album is suprising &amp; different than I thought it would be, definitley BETTER than the last album, but she still strains at singing the parts, especially that dreadful &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a woman&quot; song that we could have all done without &amp; if I never hear that song again, I'd be fine. Its reminicent of that single &quot;Don't let me be the last to know&quot; in where, she struggles to belt out the notes throughout the song! I think her writers really need to write songs she can actually sing. Well, hopefully they'll learn. Overall, its a good cd if you like Britney, not a disappointment, and somewhat better than her last. All in all, its a Britney Cd.
B000002UB6|5.0|The Beatles album Let it Be is truley a rocken disk. The raw feeling of the inruments and vocals are the best part about the cd. You feel like your in a garage with the band. All the writting on the album is great as well. Two songs that make the whole album worth buying are two of us, and dig a poney. So check out the album, you cant miss with the beatles.
0393317552|2.0|Diamond's thesis is that it was geographical determinsm that was responsible for the dominance of the West, and that cultural factors- individualism, capitalism and so forth- were only of short term importance. He does have interesting answers for every exception to his rule, and indeed, he builds a compelling story to explain every culture and its success or failure.<br />But none of these stories are universals, and none is applicable outside the region in question. Each of Diamond's stories amounts to what we might call a &quot;Just So&quot; story, after Kipling's tales by the same name. Building backwards from the outcome, Diamond can justify the special cases in each instance, but his universals all fail. For instance, China didn't attain the power of the west because it unified too soon, and this happend becasue it lacked the peninsulas and mountain ranges that isolated communities in Europe, allowing for greater development of different experiments in societal structure. This &quot;Island Geography&quot; approach is attractive and it echos a common thread in biodiversity, but it certainly doesn't explain the dominance of North America today- or the difference between North and South America.<br />One problem with Diamond's thesis is that he's inconsistent. Sometimes it's the shortage of natural resources that triggers advancement of technology, and sometimes that same shortage impairs it. Having a lot of natural resources is similarly invoked to explain success and failure.<br />A more serious problem is that Diamond has taken one brief snapshot in time- the world since the 19th Century- and has taken that as the absolute measure of the success or failure of a society and a geography. But a few centuries ago it was the world oif the East that was predominant, and indeed the Arabic world came very close to completely conquering Europe. Had Diamond written his book then, he would have needed to justify his thesis  with arguments opposite from those he presents. And perhaps in another few centuries things will have reversed once more. Given all that, I find his argument singularly unconvincingAnd perhaps in another few centuries things will have reversed once more. Given all that, I find his argument singularly unconvincing
B00000JMQC|5.0|I am 16 years old and I absolutely love Return to Oz, infact, it is my favorite movie.  The characters are portrayed in a new parallel compared to the original Wizard of Oz.  Dorothy, Princess Maumbi, Tick Tock, the Wheelers and the Knome king bring the movie to life.  I love how the characters in the real world are characters in Oz.  For instance, Tick Tock being the shock machine, the doctor being the Knome king, Princess Maumbi being the wicked lady at the hospital and the men wheeling carts as the Wheelers.  I also love the director's use of foreshadow throught the beginning.  For instance, the scene where the blonde girl brings Dorothy the pumpkin.  I definitley reccommend this movie to anyone who wants a different kind of fairy tale.  The best part is watching it over and over and seeing things that you missed before!  Watch it!!!!!
B00003CX8I|5.0|This was a great movie. The storyline was easy to follow and thorough. The special effects were fantastic. There wasn't that many characters but the characters were great. Magneto was a good villain. I can't wait until the sequal. Hopefully in the sequal there will be more superheroes and villains and the storyline will still be great. I would like to see Arnold Swarzenneggar play Colossus and Jean Claude Van Damme or Mel Gibson play Gambit. Spiderman will be out in theaters in May of 2002 for anybody who wants to know.

B00005OM4N|4.0|Considering that I'm not a big Britney fan I have to admit that I have enjoyed this so far. Of course I have had no choice because my daughter has listened to it non-stop for about 24 hours. However this seems to be a CD where Britney is beginning to stretch herself. Yes most of her music still seems directed to the 12-15 female range, especially with songs like &quot;I'm not a girl, not yet a women&quot;, but the music is upbeat, positive, and downright enjoyable. My favorites are the old Joan Jett Cover &quot;I Love Rock &amp; Roll&quot; and &quot;That's where you take me&quot;.<br />I'm sure you'll see the critics just rip this effort but take it from me (and I'm 44 years old) make up your own mind. There is very good music here. I would definitely recommend this to ANY Britney fan, but also to some of the older crowd looking for a solid musical and vocal effort.
6305268843|5.0|I love this movie, especially the music!  I bought the VHS as soon as it became available.  Later on I bought my mother a copy in case something happened to mine.  (...) Where there's a will, there's a way.
B00003CXTF|5.0|I watched Pearl Harbor when it was out on theaters. I must say that it was a great movie. The creditenials of the historical events are accurate. <br />There are two scenes in Pearl Harbor that are my favorite. The scene were Rafe and Danny fly the airplanes and shoot the Japenese down! The save the day! That was so cool. The other scene is very sad. Rafe and Danny are looking around, and the men are stuck inside of the ship. Danny or Rafe touches one of the men's hand, and anyone couldn't do anything about getting them out of the ship. <br />I cannot wait to purchase Pearl Harbor. It is a great movie even if have some problems with the love story.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I received my copy on Monday. I watched the DVD twice so far, and I too think it's an improvement over the old versions. I particularly liked the seamless integration of new visual effects into the original ones. They do look as if they're done 22 years ago. The sound is improved as well with  lots of tiny details added. But on my machine it didn't sound as *cracking* as some of recent, digitally recorded movies. Although trimming and deleting some scenes did help to make the film move faster, I felt that some of human elements as well as musical rhythms have been lost as a result. One example is in the beginning where starfleet officers are checking on their screen the three Klingon battleships being attacked by an alien object. Jerry Goldsmith's music is essential here in conveying the urgent mood of the coming catastrophe, but it is cut by a second or two due to the trimming (Mr. Goldsmith, please check it out yourself!). Too bad they didn't leave the music untouched. Another example is a sequence in which lieutenant Ilia provides her treatment to one of wounded crew members. Here, in the extended TV version a doctor looks at Ilia once with awe &amp; surprise and does it again a moment later. I always thought this was one of the most inspiring scenes in the movie. Unfortunately, in the new director's cut, the second glance at Ilia has been cut out hereby diminishing the psychological effects of Ilia's mysterious power. Another part they shouldn't have altered is the Prelude &amp; the beginning title. In both of the old versions, the screen during the first few minutes is all black, while in the new version they added stars flying backwards. This is nothing but a cliche. I mean, I've seen so many science fiction films that begin and end just like this that I felt that adding stars has cheapened the static, grandiose mood of the beginning that's so essential in this film. Still, the newly created V'Ger spaceship looks great, as are the Vulcan planet and the new bases in S.F. city.<br />Overall, I like the new edition very much but don't want to be without the 1983 TV version either.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Is Citizen Kane the best film ever?  I don't know.  I'm not sure it's either possible or advisable to quantify art in such a manner.  I love it.  I also love Young Frankenstein.  Is THAT the best film ever?  Probably not.  Best is a lousy word to bandy about here.  Is this an extremely lovingly-made issue of a classic, influencial piece of particularly well-realized film history?  ABSOLUTELY.<br />Like it or not, Kane had a massive influence on nearly everything that followed, all the way up to Pulp Fiction.  Simply put, my recommendation would be to get this DVD for three reasons.  It's a foundation of the techniques we take for granted in  film today.  It's a beautifully done set of DVDs, extras galore & a stunning transfer.  It's an engrossing character study/morality tale set up in a challenging non-linear story.  As for the rest of fine reasons to own it, other more eloquent reviewers have already weighed in.  Check 'em out.<br />One or two caveats.  This movie isn't for everyone by any means.  Want to sit back and simply be entertained?  This may not be your cup of tea.  As I said, the narrative isn't plot driven so much as a lifelong character study, so it may not immediately engage you the way, say, Rear Window might.  Certainly this isn't for everyone.  Often artistic achievments aren't (I still can't get into The Sound & The Fury; I respect it, but I just can't enjoy it; Oh well).<br />(...) As many have mentioned, widescreen didn't happen in the theaters until 1953, partially as a reaction to television in the home as a way of setting movies apart & attempt to regain lost audience.  The aspect ratio of Kane is almost identical to that of your standard TV, so pop it in and for once enjoy a bit of art appropriate without black bars.<br />I suppose in summation I should say that this is a wonderful, challenging, idiosyncratic work, full of amazing and groundbreaking technique, presented in a beautifully wrought DVD that does justice to it's rank as a great film, and that many people predisposed to rankings feel it's the best film of all time.
0782008372|2.0|There are certain rules to making a good movie.  Rule number one clearly states do NOT cast Christopher Lambert.  Putting the fact the he is a terrible actor aside, he is not Scottish.  He does not even try to fake a Scottish accent in this movie.  The only thing this movie has going for it is the strong story line.  Unfortunately, poor acting and '80's movie syndrome kindof ruin it.  It is good for a laugh though.  If only it had been directed by a good director with a Scot cast aws the Scot and a Spaniard cast as the Spaniard...It would be nice to see a remake...
B000001ELL|5.0|You know people say this is disco when infact only the superb 'I Was Made For Lovin You' really truely fits that category. I mean can you imagine how quickly the dance floor would clear with any of the other tracks on offer here? Anyway to me this is the end of a dynasty in terms of an album that has the true Kiss magic intact. Don't get me wrong there are certainly other five star discs after this with the ultra bombast of a 'Creatures' and the snarl of a 'Revenge' to keep the fires burning, but this was the last time the fab four seemed united (although we would later learn how fragmented this recording was in terms of personnel and imput from the whiskered one). Paul's writing is stella with his highlight being the poppish 'Sure Know Something' but all of his contributions are uniformily strong. Certainly they display a maturing of style without loosing any fire power in the passsion department. Ace's stuff is a revelation from the rock solid '2000 Man' cover through to his finest moment bar non in the autobiographical 'Hard Times'. This is the best work he has done period! Disappointing is the limited song numbers from Simmons with the clever 'Charisma' an early 'I Love It Loud' protege (although much more enjoyable this time around) and the bring a smile to your face cheese of 'X Ray Eyes' with radar sound effect being the only two. An extra song from the demon would have given a little more balance to side one perhaps. The sole contribution from Criss in 'Dirty Livin' is in my opinion worthy of inclusion and despite what others may say a catchy little ditty to these ears. I recommend hunting down the remix 12' version of this song although it is very hard to find these days! So there we have it an end of an era folks but wasn't it a fantastic ride? Just as an after thought I read how much the band spent on the cover..funny how Peter couldn't even get his green eye makeup equal, so much for the quality department lol! The remaster contains a fantastic poster being a stark head and shoulders group shot against grey background which is awesome. Shame the costumes they revealed later from the neck down for this tour were like a Vegas nightmare! Where is my Elvis cape...thank you very much!ing a stark head and shoulders group shot against grey background which is awesome.

B00004W510|5.0|This record is a one-of-a-kind journey through American music.  Part country, part rock, part blues, part music hall, part back porch jam...all brilliant.  Even George Harrison (who played guitar for a little group you may remember) says it's the greatest album he's ever heard.  Ranks with the most brilliant works of Dylan, The Stones, and The Beatles.  But it can only be described as sounding like The Band.  Buy it!

6305350205|1.0|So much potential, wasted. <br />This could've been a really good film if only. If only they'd thrown out everything, or at least almost everything. Here's a few of things that will take away from your enjoyment of Star Trek 5, LAMBADA, I mean &quot;The Final Frontier&quot;<br />The special effects are sub par. There's a few shots of the Enterprise near the beginning that aren't bad, particularly the beauty shot of the ship and the moon, nice touch. But unfortunately, it's one of the few actual shots of the Enterprise you will see in ST5. Here's a hint for the producers of Trek. Fans like the ship, we like to see the ship, please include exterior shots of the ship in your films whenever possible. Other effects include the horrible &quot;planet&quot; beyond the &quot;great effects barrier&quot; that looks more like a visual depiction of Vicks Vapor-action than a planet. Really all the effects seem quite crude in comparison to other trek films; maybe they blew the budget getting Shatner to direct.<br />The story lacks a villain. Sybok, the happy Vulcan, is about as close as you'll get to one here. The problem with Sybok is, he really isn't dangerous and you'll find his laugh intoxicating. There's also a stupid sub-plot with a rogue Klingon; Captain Krunch or something like that. He's about as threatening as a french poodle with the hairstyle to match. Cap'n Krunch's main purpose in this movie seems to be to blast an ancient Voyager-style space probe(like V'Ger from ST:TMP) into bits. Maybe in a future film a Voyager-style probe will be kind enough to blast an ancient copy of ST5 into dust. There's an even more stupid sub, sub-plot involving the Klingon William Conrad, the henchman from Titanic and some Romulan Babe on planet Nimrod-3 which looks a lot like Tatooine. Its all pretty lame! <br />And just who are these people? This movie was made in 1989, which means the original series had been out of production for 20 YEARS when this came out. Did the writers never watch this show? Hardly any of the characters in Star Trek 5 even remotely resemble the original series characters. Examples:<br />A) - Capt. Kirk is now into rock climbing (something never before mentioned). He's annoyed that Starfleet would call him to deal with an alien threat, completely contradicting already established movies where Kirk couldn't wait to get out there and kick some alien can! And Kirk's relationship to Spock and Bones seems more like Moe's relationship to Larry and Curly in this movie.<br />B) - Spock now has a brother, Sybok, who he never saw fit to mention before. Spock chooses not to shoot Sybok and save the ship. So what happened? Did the emotionless Mr. Spock have a bad feeling about shooting an intruder? Is this the same Spock that would have let his own father die (in &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;) rather than relinquish the helm to Scotty for a few hours? I guess we could blame this on that &quot;being dead and brought back to life thing.&quot; I choose to blame Shatner instead.<br />C) - Scotty, what the hell is your deal. You can repair the transporter when the damn Doomsday Machine is blastin' chunks outta the hull, but you can't fix it in dry-dock? And what about all the other malfunctions on board? Mr. Scott is supposed to be the &quot;miracle worker&quot;, yet he can't even keep the Captain's palm pilot from self-destructing. Scotty! Quit sniffin' around Uhura and get to work!<br />D) - Sulu, Uhura and Chekov seem a bit different too, but maybe that's because they actually get to do something in this film, which I guess is good except there is a weird and disturbing Scotty/Uhura romance hinted at and possibly even a Sulu/Chekov! (what are they doing out in the woods alone?) Dr. McCoy seems cranky, which is at least normal behavior for him.<br />E) - The U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-A: WHAT THE HELL? Somehow the whole ship undergoes a facelift from the last movie, the bridge is completely changed and somebody has added like a hundred extra decks and steering wheel, and nothing works right. To quote Kirk &quot;Starfleet has a lot of nerve sending us out in this condition...&quot; Damn straight! What happened? Did they buy the parts from some Ferengi huckster?<br />Finally the whole plot is just bloody dull! Sybok the happy Vulcan is looking for the Supreme Being (God) on planet Shakaree, the previously mentioned Vicks Vapor-Action planet of heavenly lint. Sybok and his followers take over the Enterprise with relative ease, then sets a course for the &quot;great big effect barrier&quot; Kirk, Spock, and McCoy eventually make nice with him, all go down to planet Vapor-rub, they find out that &quot;God&quot; is really a hairy thunderer in a Santa suit, Sybok croaks everybody is happy, the end. SNORE! <br />It's just all really sad. It's as though no one making Star Trek 5 had ever seen Star Trek before, there's no clever new gadgets, no socially relevant commentary, no sir, NO NOTHING! No vision of the future to make us gasp in awe, even the heavenly lint ball planet looks nasty. This place is supposed to look like Heaven, but it looks more like Death Valley shot through a pair of Ray-Bans. Fortunately, this film can be missed without missing anything. It adds nothing to the Star Trek mythos and should be written off as Kirk's fever dream. <br />I'm a trekkie, and I even own a copy of this movie, but Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier is neither final, nor frontier. It's just bad.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out in 1984 when I was a teenager.  I thought it was a great movie then and it is still a great movie.  It doesn't seem dated at all.   <BR>  The movie is about a humanlike (cyborg) killing machine from the future that comes back to 1984 to kill a young woman  before she gives birth to a boy who will be a leader in the future. A man from the future also comes back to try and save her from the Terminator.<BR>   The movie has a great story to it. It has a very dark and moody atmosphere to it mainly because of the perfect music that goes along with the movie. The plot line will really make you think all the way through.  A very smart film.  You will be on the edge of your seat all the way through with very few scenes to catch your breath.  <BR>  The acting in it is superb.  Arnold makes the perfect Terminator.  Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton have excellent chemistry together.<BR>  The special effects are very nice.  Especially when you consider that computer graphics were not used back when this movie came out.  The effects are very realistic and you will never say anything looks fake.  You will probably be surprised when you watch the documentary.  The effects don't seem at all dated like some movies during that time.<BR>  One of the main things that attracted me to this dvd is that they remixed the soundtrack to support 5.1 digital surround sound. It was originally in mono. It sounds awesome!  I have seen quite a few action, sci-fi movies that have great multi-channel sound and this movie sounds the best so far.  From the spaceships in the future to the machine gun fire, it totally surrounds you! Fantastic!  <BR>  The extras including two documentaries and deleted scenes are worth the price of admission alone. Some very interesting facts about the movie that will make you say, &quot;that's how they did that?!&quot;.  <BR>  If you were too young when it came out at the theater or you have seen it on t.v. where it is edited to death youneed this dvd.  Especially if you have a 5.1 surround system, this is a must have for your collection. This movie is as fresh as it was in the mid 80's and will be fresh thirty years from now. A true classic sci-fi movie.
B000031WI8|5.0|I was in London when I first heard 'Young Guns' and every time I hear this song or 'Bad Boys', it takes me back to that hot summer day in Great Britain. 'Wham !' was a great pop band and they even wrote their own songs - and great songs they were. 'Wham Rap' gets things started and the fun does not stop until the very last note of 'The Edge of Heaven'. This is pop music at its best - timeless and uplifting. 'Club Tropicana' takes you back to one of those long gone summer fun vacations, 'Freedom' is so good, even Oasis stole from it (listen to their 'Fade Away' which ripped off the whole verse chord progression), 'Everything She Wants' will get every party started and 'Last Christmas' will forever stay a Holiday classic.<BR>Unfortunately, on this re-release, the record company still did not include the fantastic 'Blue' which was on the original Vinyl double LP of 'The Final'.
0800187814|5.0|I have watched this movie multiple times and have always found it to be a fascinating portrayal of colorful characters.  Larry Flynt, played convincingly by Woody Harrelson, and his real life brother Brett Harrelson, playing brother of Larry in the movie, was a nice touch.  I think that added to the believabilty of the portrayals too.  The most fascinating in a movie award goes to.    Courtney, I LOVE you in this role.  Never have I seen an actress play a role so convincingly as musician and actress Courtney Love played the Althea Flynt character.   She was no less than mesmerizingly wild, beautiful, neurotic and one step away from self destruction from the beginning of the film.  Then once she joins Larry in taking his pain medication after the assasination attempt outside the courtroom paralyzes him forever, she spirals into oblivion so genuinely played,you can't wait for her scenes.  In my opinion, she makes this movie achieve greatness.    Ex-NYC mayor Rudy Guiliani's ex-wife, Donna Hanover, plays a great role as evangelist sister of ex-president Jimmy Carter, Ruth Carter-Stapleton.  She introduces Larry to the re-born life, only to lose him again after he is shot, and the epiphany he experienced through her mentoring, is lost.Edward Norton is also wonderful as Larrys long suffering lawyer.  When they go up against Jerry Falwell in court, Woody is truly hilarious as Larry at his most ornery.   All in all, a very entertaining movie that the prudish, or devout won't care for...but they know who they are, and probably wouldn't be watching this film anyway.  For the rest of us, even if we don't like the man, or what he stands for, we will be entertained by this biopic.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Well have to say that Britney did it again with her third album intitled &quot;Britney&quot;.The album is very mature and you can tell she has grown to a woman and left behind the girl image for Baby One More Time and Oops I Did It Again.The album kicks off with her first single which is &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot; which is a great song and you never get tired of it. Here is the others tracks and my rating about them.<br />Track 2 &quot;Overprotected&quot; get song it talks about that everyone treats her like a little girl and to let her go so she can do what she wants. 10 stars<br />Track 3 &quot;Lonely&quot; which is one of my fav. talks about that she wants to be lonely because she gave this guy to many chances but he still doesn't want to change. 10 stars<br />Track 4 &quot;Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot; it's the only ballad on the cd I give it 8 stars<br />Track 5 &quot;Boys&quot; it's about her thinking about boys and she wants to get in a nasty world with them and she says you can't live with them can't live without them. 9 stars<br />Track 6 &quot;Anticipating&quot; not one of my favs but still good talks about her going out with friends and having fun. 7 stars<br />Ok got tired the rest are going to be in star rating.<br />Track 7 &quot;I Love Rock N Roll&quot; 7 stars<br />Track 8 &quot;Cinderella&quot; 9 stars<br />Track 9 &quot;Let Me Be&quot; 9 stars<br />Track 10 &quot;Bombastic Love&quot; 10 stars<br />Track 11 &quot;That's Where You Take Me&quot; 10 stars<br />Track 12 &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot; 10 stars<br />That's it so the whole cd is worth buying and Britney did also with this cd and wrote some of the songs aswell. Finally heard the bonus tracks great aswell. Hoped you enjoyed my review and will purchase it.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Love and Theft is a return to form for Bob Dylan.  Not a return to writing great songs, he's always managed quite a few gems.  He seems comfortable again on this album.  For the first time since Desire he sounds like he's happy singing the music he's making.  Highwater (for Charley Patton), Tweedle Dee, Summer Days, just a few examples of what Bob does with a band, with his band.  This new album feels like Bob has a faith in his band and he wants them to be heard.  Was Planet Waves the last time he wanted the world to really hear &quot;the band&quot; that he's playing with?  If you liked the unplugged disc, or what Bob's been doing in concert for the last five plus years, then you'll be blown away by what he does here.  If you don't like any of that, well, you just don't get it.<BR>Tweedle Dee gets the album rolling and rocking with it's fun beat and sly lyrics.  Mississippi was recorded for Time Out Of Mind but not released.  Here it is an anchor for Love and Theft in the all important song 2 slot.  Summer Days is next and it just keeps switching gears fast, slow, rollicking fun and heartbreak.  The more you listen to it, the more amazing things you notice.<BR>It's an album of good old roots rock crossed with rollicking country blues and the artist going for a sound that keeps him so far ahead of the game.  If you don't like the music on the radio today, because it has no soul, buy Love and Theft.<BR>This is a true &quot;artist&quot; painting another masterpiece, that makes you feel the way only great art can: alive, happy, sad, loved and lovesick.  Who doesn't want to feel that?
B00005QW5X|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie in a cinema, do so before it's too late. Or see it on a gigantic screen.<br />This movie is destined to become some kind of cult classic, but I dont think it will reach that status for some time to come. It's the type of movie that will boom on video and soon after, people will demand it be re-released in the cinemas! Hopefully Anually!<br />The music is Fab, the content is Wow, and the glam is Rock!!
0345440757|5.0|This book is a great read if you are having your first child, or if you are having another. &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot;, by Matt Pasquinilli, is another great book once you have children. &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot; contains invaluable hints and advice to help you learn how to overcome the anxiety and stress associated with parenthood. I strongly sugest that you get both books and read them over and over as your children grow.

B00005QB9A|5.0|I saw part of this movie for the first time in passing a premium cable channel. I then stalked through the guides to find out when it would be on. I watched it. I was amazed. I then spent a few hours hunting it down online, but could only find it in VHS PAL format...until just recently. Wonderful can not begin to describe the rich plot, music, and characters to this film. What amazed me more than the film was the fact it was never released in the US back in 1989. A true shame. I highly reccommend purchasing the soundtrack as well.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The movie was trimmed a bit to tighten up scenes and such. I was glad they added the sound effects of the old bridge to bring a sense of continnuty to the new ship.<br />I was very dissapointed all the Memory Wall footage was not shown. I wanted to see the sets. They just showed an actor on a wire going down a movie set which looked like a wall from the entity. Then there was a pass with no sound with the costume coming towards the camera. There were so many photos I have seen of that deleted scene that at least I wanted to see the other portions of the set. Wise was right in his decision to remove it. It did look like they were on wires.<br />The case is another dissapointment. The plastic disk holder falls out if you don't open it correctly. It's like a two page disk container and you can lose the disk very easily if you are not careful. Since my Star Trek Motion Picture disk is going to get lots of repeated viewings I am going to switch the case from my Star Wars Episode one disk. The Episode One Disk plastic case won't fall apart like this one did.<br />Other than that along with the dissapointing Memory Wall footage, it was a decent package. We finally get to see what V'Jer looks like without the clouds surrounding it. If it were up to me I would have added a scene that shows the exterior and massive size of the craft in comparison to the Enterprise. I was so surprised to see this thing had an actual shape. It looked like an alien ship out of Babylon Five. With Foundation Imageing ....the guys who did the CGI on B5 working on this...it's only natural.
B00000255X|5.0|most wonderful, beautiful, meaningful Bob Dylan album, let alone any album ever......A stronghold in my life....
B00005OB0A|3.0|I am a HUGE Kylie Fan, and have been since the 1980s, when she first started her music career.  Unfortunately, in the UK, she is constantly compared with Madonna by the press and, I believe, this is a totally pointless and futile comparison.  Both artistes excel, but in totally different ways, especially musically.<br />&quot;Light Years&quot; was Kylie's huge comeback album last year and drew upon camp disco excess.  &quot;Fever&quot; is a totally different affair, arguably more 'grown-up', with a tight, urgent feel to it.  However, I seem to be one of the few people who were disappointed with this album.  &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; is, without a doubt, THE stand-out track.  That's not simply because it has been a MASSIVE hit almost worldwide, but because it is a truly classic pop/dance song.<br />For me, though, the album fails to deliver ultimately.  Many of the tracks seem to merge into one.  Also, having clubbed my way through the 80s, I fail to hear this 80s influence that everyone seems to talk about.<br />And, Priest, Kylie is Australian, NOT a Brit as you state in the title of your review (although I'd be extremely proud if she were!).
B00005R2C2|5.0|This was a great Walt Disney movie.  My kids already own every one available and this one was a perfect addition to their collection.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This is the most exhaustive collection of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music to have ever been compiled.  The band's albums had been previously released on compact disks several times including two albums on one disk, single disk format and remastered formats, but none of them ever contained bonus material.  This six disk set not includes everyone of their albums in a stunning new remastered sound, but elusive bonus material going back to their days as The Golliwogs.  This set is a must for any fans of the biggest American band of the late sixties and the creators of some of the greatest singles in music history.
B000050XEI|5.0|I can't scan through my radio stations these days without hearing &quot;Only Time&quot; by Enya.  And that's NOT a bad thing.  An even better thing is owning her CD, &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;.  Ever since the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, Enya's music has revealed it's soothing and healing powers.  Other notable tracks include &quot;Tempus Vernum&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, and &quot;One By One&quot;.  The title track is an appropriate instrumental opening for one unbelievable masterpiece, which &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is.  Enya has outdone herself, as usual.
0385505833|3.0|A charming little book, humor and irony intact.  Won't take long to read but enjoyable.  Definitely Grisham-Lite.  This is an escape book - - don't plan to think very hard.
0345347951|5.0|I'm not the kind of person who really enjoys reading, but I had to read for my English class, and I really liked this book.  It was a short and easy book to read, and it was very good.  I don't think someone who doesn't like Sci-Fi would enjoy it, but certainly someone who neither likes Sci-Fi nor dislikes it would enjoy the book (Wow that's a long sentence).  It's worth buying -- or at least checking out at the library.  It's a good read.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is the story of a family in 1930's Maycomb, Alabama.  The father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who does the best he can for his two children, Jeremy (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout).  The story is told in retrospect by Scout and spans about three years of her young life.<br />This book has several themes and each person who reads it will come away finding their own personal meaning in the story.<br />For me it is the poignancy with which the author shows us how Scout watches Atticus, her nanny Calpurnia, and the other people around her to learn what is -Grace, compassion, courage, decency, tolerance, forgiveness, dignity, honor, and ultimately love.<br />I think Harper Lee was right when she said she always considered her book to be a simple love story.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Points:<br />1. This is probably the most &quot;special&quot; of special editions in existence.  I've never seen so many extras on a DVD.  They are plentiful and well done, and the classic Python humor pervades them all.  Two separate tracks of very funny commentary by the surviving Pythons, a new 50-minute &quot;return to the Holy Grail locations&quot; documentary that is VERY cool for fans, and LOTS more.  I don't want to spoil the surprises...but there are some great surprises!   <br />2. I've read the other reviewers who said they've had problems with subtitles popping up during the movie, even when they turned them off repeatedly.  I haven't had that problem, so I'm not sure what to say about that.  Apparently this is more a problem with some DVD players than with others.  But mine has been glitch-free.<br />3. The menus are terrific, and consist of crazy Gilliam animations that go on for a long time before repeating (if you want to sit and stare at the menus, that is).  Very fun to watch, relative to your typical DVD menus.  <br />4. There are no &quot;pink frilly edges,&quot; and I don't think anybody ever seriously intended to have them.  That was just a joke on the box cover.  I'm glad they aren't there, actually...it would have gotten old very quick.  <br />5. Apparently one or two of the swedish subtitles during the title sequence may be missing (?).  I didn't notice it, but another reviewer did.  Most of them are there, at least.  If this small omission bugs you, you've been warned.  <br />6. The only pseudo-glitch I found was pretty minimal.  When I went to the photo sections, a picture would pop up clear and fine...but after about two seconds, the image would sort of 'shift', and would become slightly less focused than before.  It is really a subtle thing, though, and you won't notice it unless you are really staring.<br />7. This is in &quot;true&quot; widescreen...none of that faked stuff that you find by less reputable DVD makers.  Also, the picturequality is better than I've ever seen it before.  <br />8. There is some memorabilia included here, but unfortunately the print on most of it is too small to read.  So you'll probably shuffle through that pretty quickly.<br />All in all, dollar for dollar, this is one of the best DVDs I've ever bought.  Beyond the movie, there is enough good stuff on here to keep you laughing for hours.  No kidding.
0446677450|2.0|Kiyosaki provides some helpful information in this book.  However, he could have summarized the information much more concisely.  He spends a considerable amount of time focusing on a few key instructions: acquire assets and not liabilites, make money work for you, don't get caught up in the &quot;rat race,&quot; don't waste your time on traditional education, and become financially literate.  He does not go in depth with any of these ideas; if you're looking for a how-to book, this one is not for you.  Additionally, he supports his ideas about financial success with only moderately interesting and not at all engaging stories from his childhood. <BR> <BR>Kiyosaki repeats a few select, vague ideas over and over again.  For that reason, I cannot recommend the book.  It's only redeeming quality is that it does teach something about economics.  If you're looking for a general, base-line instruction on how to be rich, this book would be worthwhile.
068484267X|5.0|i can honestly say that this is the best book i have ever read. it has the perfect mixture of comedy and and tragedy.i highly recommend this book.
B000000XB9|5.0|This CD has just about every great early CCR song.  You really appreciate the talent of John Fogerty, who created that gritty down South CCR sound.  He can still do a pretty fair job of rocking even now.  Every time I hear Suzie Q it reminds me of that patrol boat on the Mekong river in the flick Apocalypse Now.  If you need to purchase a CD that will replace all your old CCR vinyl, this is the one.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I love this classic album for many reasons.  First of all, it was the beginning of the career of one of the greatest rock bands of all time.  The songs are absolutely rocking from beginning to end and are top-notch quality.  On top of that, this album represents the beginning of an era of music that I enjoy the most--the melodic hard rock genre.  For sure, this album is much more rock than pop.  It just doesn't get any better than this.<br />&quot;Runnin' With The Devil&quot;, &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love&quot; and &quot;Jamie's Cryin'&quot; were the big rock radio hits.  All are absolute classics.  &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; is a funny, cool little diddy, and songs like &quot;Atomic Punk&quot; and &quot;On Fire&quot; absolutely rock.  And of course, it is impossible not to rave about the classic Eddie instrumental &quot;Eruption&quot;, which set the standard for how to play the electric guitar.  The energy level displayed by the band on this effort was immense.  All these years and changes and albums later, this one still blows me away.  One of the best rock albums ever!
B00005LIN0|5.0|...This is a film (made for TV, I believe) adaptation of a very highly regarded Glyndebourne Festival production of Porgy and Bess from the late 1980s, which was revived in the early '90s.  The cast acted their roles on a set at Shepperton Studios and, probably for acoustic reasons, lip-synched their roles to a dubbed version of the original EMI studio recording of the opera (which also, incidentally, received a very favorable critical response).  Unfortunately, the dubbing was, perhaps unavoidably, obvious in places...  Unlike the CD, however, it allows you to see as well as hear what is going on, complete with subtitles if you wish.  And it does this on one single-sided disk, so you don't need to change disks three times to get through the whole opera.  I sympathize with those who miss the Preminger movie, but I think it's really unfair to trash a production of the actual opera because you prefer the musical treatment to the operatic one.  It's kind of like criticizing The Beatles \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" because you'd rather watch Peter Frampton in the movie of the same name.<br />...
B000002L99|5.0|With the exception of AC/DC's &quot;Back In Black&quot; album with Brian Johnson, never in the history of rock and roll has a band had so much success with a first album after a major lead singer change.  Clearly, this album deserves the success it got, as it is another of many VH masterpieces.<br />People criticize Sammy for bringing this band too much into the pop realm, but the truth is the stage for that was already set on the previous album &quot;1984&quot;--the last Roth album.  This album just continues the direction that was started then--and it is carried off masterfully with one of the best hard rock voices of a generation.<br />Make no mistake about it--this album still rocks.  The opening track &quot;Good Enough&quot; indicates that.  &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot;, while a top 5 single, is still for sure a very rocking track.  &quot;Get Up&quot; is very hard and fast-paced.  Then comes a true album highlight, the keyboard-heavy &quot;Dreams&quot;.  What an awesome soaring anthem with great melodies and a lovely sentiment.  Too heavy in parts to really be called a ballad--especially at some of the guitar solo points.  &quot;Summer Nights&quot; is also a classic rock anthem--very melodic with a &quot;good time&quot; feel.<br />The rest of the album is also high quality, although the last track &quot;Inside&quot; is a bit strange.  Still like it, though.  For sure, &quot;Best Of Both Worlds&quot; and the title track are great rockers.  &quot;Love Walks In&quot; is the one true power ballad of the album--a truly fantastic melodic effort where the keyboards and Sammy's vocal range dominate.  All in all, this is a fantastic effort that belongs in any '80s rock fan's collection.  One of the best albums from one of rock music's best eras.
B00005ASHM|5.0|You know all of the gushing reviews of this album?  <BR>How it's a pop masterpiece?  <BR>How it was and still is a groundbreaking collection?<br />It's all true.  If you want to learn about everything that's right in pop music, get a hold of Pet Sounds.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is proof that Luc Besson is one of the best directors about today (along with Martin Scorsese and Oliver Stone). He has taken a simple idea and given it a twist. The film has a perfect cast including Gary Oldman as a Psychotic, drug fuelled maniac (a theory estsablished by the films best sound bite 'death is whimsical today'). Thierry Arbogast (the cinematographer) should of recieved an Oscar for the incredible 6 minute escape sequence from the hotel room. <BR>Serra's moving score also help to control our emotions throughout the film and is without a doubt fantastic.<BR>Luc Besson has successfully made a film about the relationship between a lonely man and a 12 year old girl in such a way that he never allows us to view the film as perverse or Lolita-ish. He has created something theoretically controversial yet kept it completely tasteful.<BR>This is the best Hitman film ever made, Maybe the best action film and certainly wins a place in th1e top ten of any filmlist. WATCH IT!

Thank You, Bruce, Patti, Clarence,Mighty Max,Dan, Nils,Gary,Roy  and last but not least...Steven
B000003N7G|5.0|Forget all the mystique and technical commentary about Coltrane -- this is an experience for every listener. You do not need to be a 'jazz expert' (whatever that means) or consumed by religion to appreciate this. 'A Love Supreme' is one of the most accessible, powerful works of popular music in existence. It transcends the genre -- read the reviews, there are plenty of listeners for whom this was their first or second jazz album. If you are new to Coltrane or to jazz, you won't go wrong by starting here.<br />I once read, in a comparison between Coltrane and Stan Getz -- another outstanding tenor sax -- that while you admired Getz' incredible technique or the way he interpreted a particular passage, with Coltrane you were taken by the immensity of the experience. 'A Love Supreme' is exactly that -- a wave of sound, from Coltrane's incomparable saxophone to McCoy Tyner's piano, Garrison's bass and Elvin Jones unforgettable percussion. If you're looking for background music or easy listening, look elsewhere. For 35 minutes of some of the most powerful music of the past century, five stars isn't enough.
B000001IPP|5.0|This is probably the most fun punk CD ever made. The songs are catchy, simple, short, and have awesome shout-along choruses. This is Rancid's least recognized CD, which dissapoints me, because it is one of the simplest and best in the Rancid collection. The best songs are Nihilism, Radio (co-written by Billie Joe from Green Day!), Salvation, Tenderloin, Let's Go, As One, Ballad of Jimmy and Johhny, Gunshot, and Harry Bridges. Fun, catchy, excellent record which you should have as soon as possible.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Many of you who may have saw this album may have thought, &quot;I didn't like Kid A, and I bet Amnesiac is Kid A, part 2.&quot; Well it's not part 2, but its own album. Let me review each song<BR>1)Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box (4/5): Sort of like an techno tribal dance with kitchen pots as precussion.  This is a really good openning track to the album.<BR>2)Pyramid Song (5/5): Wonderful, beautiful song.  Thom's piano driven &quot;ballad&quot; (word used loosely) is one of the highhlights of the album. Probably the third best song.<BR>3)Pulk/Pull Revolving doors (3/5): An OK song, doesn't really stand out, though.<BR>4)You And Whose Army?(5/5): Excellent song.  It starts out slow, but as you get to about the 2 minute mark, there's a crecendo and the whole band joins in, with Thom's powerful piano part leading the way.<BR>5)I might be wrong (5/5):Very guitar driven and very conventional.  Gives you a gimpse of The Bends days, but retaining the experimental style.  Best song on the album.<br />6)Knives Out (3/5):The most conventional song, no fooling around here, just guitars, bass, drums, and voice.  An ok song, but it's a good choice for a single<BR>7)Morning Bell/Amnesiac (4/5):A slower, dirgey version of Morning Bell.  Gone is the shuffle of the Kid A version, and Thom's voice sounds more desperate.<BR>8)Dollars &amp; Cents (5/5): Excellent song. Thom's voice sounds carefree with the incessant &quot;Why won't you quiet down&quot; ringing throughout the piece.<BR>9)Hunting Bears (5/5): I thought I'd never give an instrumental piece 5 stars, but this is a heck of a lot better than treefingers.  Just harsh guitar with swooshes in the background.<BR>10)Like Spinnign Plates (3/5): Quick records scratching in the background with Thom's voice pushed to the front.  Thom sounds like his tounge has been numbed and he is trying to sing. Wierd, but ok.<BR>11)Life In A Glasshouse (5/5): Ah the finale.  Has a jazzy feel to it.  Similar to The National Anthem from KidA, only a lot slower
B00005LOUS|5.0|I didn't even want to see this movie, but we took our daughter who was 2 at the time.  It was her first movie theater experience.  We were nervous that she wouldn't sit still, but the entire movie kept her captivated.  She loved it.  And I actually loved it!  There is enough silliness to keep kids interested, but enough subtle humor to entertain adults as well.  Jim Carrey is awesome in this movie.  This one is definitely going into our movie collection!
B00005OWEG|5.0|This is one of my personal favorite movies of all time. To think  <BR>that seeing this version could have topped the experience I was to encounter back 1979 was unthinkable until now. <BR>The cuts that were made caused a loss of character development, and loss of a lot of why things happened and how they happened. Anyone who LIKED the uncut version will <BR>Want to have both in their DVD collection.<BR>Then the lights came up and I walked out of the theater, this dvd was bought, no ifs ands or buts.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|YEah........... No doubt a great debut. Knopfler is genius, just like that. Its a shame his brother left the band soon after. THis debut features rock at its best, and pays homage to a lot of masters of the music.
B00004BZ16|5.0|A masterful piece of music.  None of the songs sound the same, but are artistically carried out.  While not as good as eariler Clash albums it must be taken into consideration, for its variety, lyrics, and music.  I don't the Clash could do anything bad though.
B00000F1D3|4.0|I dug this cd because a) I like dance music and b) I like Cher. I'll admit that her music is overtly cheesy but that is what makes her music more fun to listen to than say Britney Spears who sounds way too much like Alvin and the Chipmunks and just annoys me to no ends of the earth. Granted &quot;Belive&quot; was played way too much back when the cd first came out but now I can thoroughly enjoy listening to the hi-nrg sounds of the song. My main problem with the cd is that the material towards the end gets a bit weak and intolerable for me to listen to with the exception of &quot;Love is the Groove&quot;. That song I dug but I just didn't care for &quot;Taxi Taxi&quot; and the dance remix of &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;. Even though I didn't care for those songs, I adored &quot;The Power&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;Strong Enough&quot; and &quot;All or Nothing&quot; especially. &quot;All or Nothing&quot; is my very favorite track off the cd. Cher's vocals couldn't sound any better than they did on this song as well as on this cd. &quot;Believe&quot; is a fun album to listen to despite its weak moments. Sure people can mock Cher all they want to but personally I will take her over most of today's pop acts.
B00005OM4N|2.0|While the lead single I'm A Slave 4 U is a considerable departure from earlier work, and not the most pleasant track, I was hoping for more from the rest of the album.  Unfortunately, every other song sounds just like the ones around it, with the lone exception being I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (co-written by Dido).  This song might have been really good on one of her last albums, but it's pacing just sticks out like a sore thumb here.  The message behind this album is that Brit is a grown-up and will do whatever she damn well pleases.  Unfortunately, she tells us that on 12 consecutive tracks.  Maybe when she stops trying to tell us she's grown up and just does it instead, she'll make an album worth buying.  This isn't it.<br />***PARENTS!!!!!!*** This is not the best album to buy younger children (This coming from a twentysomething male).  The album is full of sexual innuendo (nothing new), but even the images on the packaging are over the top.  The CD itself has 3 images of winged naked women (titilating parts obviously obsuced).  Watch her new video, and if you want your children being exposed to that, then maybe you should let them have the disc, but otherwise avoid (buy them some new or classic U2 instead, and get them exposed to some real music!).
6305622930|5.0|General George Patton was one of the greatest Americans.  Period.  That's why only a movie as good as this one could portray his greatness.<br />Patton is a three hour epic about the eccentric military genius, played by the great George C. Scott.  This is a typical &quot;man movie,&quot; filled with exciting action shots and plenty of bravado.  George C. Scott's Patton is charismatic, a bit crazy, and incredibly inspiring.  The film is very informative, and it solifdifies General Patton's reputuation as the only military commander feared and respected by the Nazis.<br />i didn't know much about Patton before watching this, but I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of him now.  The producers of the film set out to make this a biopic about General Patton and his colorful personality.  What resulted from their efforts, however, was a movie that glorified war more than any movie could.  Don't expect it to be like Saving Private Ryan, it's more of a romanticized look at one individual and a bygone era.<br />The DVD contains plenty of special features, including previews of other Fox war movies and a &quot;making of&quot; video.  I particularly enjoyed watching that, because of Oliver Stone's funny argument that &quot;Patton&quot; was the direct cause for the invasion of Cambodia.<br />If you're looking for history films, look no further than Patton.  It's quite a long film, but it takes that long to give justice to a man like General Patton.
0201485672|5.0|I needed to buy the book, to begin to get serious about the topic. Since it is the original, I expected it to be authoritative and useful, but perhaps somewhat dense and a bit hurried. Well it's not. It's extremely well-conceived and well-executed. The language, organization, and scope are all excellent. Fowler begins with and continually provides good examples, and always chooses a clear narrative arc through the theory and practice of this new discipline.<br />He makes a single book serve equally well as tutorial and reference, which is danged hard to do. The style of writing is confident, unpretentious, crisp as a Granny Smith apple, and occasionally witty. What issues he chooses to argue forcefully are few, and are not beaten to death. What a relief. <br />As a result, the non-reference sections are a much quicker and easier read than I expected, and one can actually browse the reference on refactorings usefully. The net effect is quite a convincing case that software engineers will inevitably become expert with refactorings, as we are required more and more to design our code according to objective standards for excellence, keep our code maintainable, and review it among peers. In any case, I am now among the converts. <br />If you found Fowler's UML Distilled to be well-written, you will like this one even better. <br />I think it is a gem of a book. I will read it many times.

0312932081|5.0|In English class in tenth grade, my English teacher told us to buy a book for class.  We were groaning and whining that we had to buy stupid-English-book.  However, it turned out everyone in my class and other classes loved this book and thought it was so much worthy to buy it.  Although Ender's Game is a Sci-Fi, it doesn't feel like Sci-Fi at all.  Everyone loved how Ender grew and learned his way to reach his goal, and everyone's hope.  Irony happnes in the end of this book makes readers to dumbfounded.  LOVE THIS BOOK! you are not sure to buy it and read it because you are afraid to don't like this book, THEN YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK - ENDER&quot;S GAME IS NOT ONE OF THAT KIND OF BOOKS... YOU WILL LOVE IT!
078062999X|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's version of Hamlet combines lush and breathtaking visuals with the complete, unabridged text of Shakespeare's masterpiece.  In other versions of Hamlet, such as the ill-cast Mel Gibson film, the play is mistakenly cut down to a \\"more reasonable\\" two-hours-or-less atrocity.  The unexpurgated method allows for the inclusion of important scenes that, if removed, take away from the overall effect of the drama.  Despite its length of more than four hours, the film keeps the viewer entertained until the startling last scene.  The stunning visuals can be attributed to the rarely used 70mm film on which the play was captured and the exceptional set design involved.  The play is actually done in a 19th century motif, a unique departure from other versions of Hamlet.  Impressive costume design add to the remarkable images in the film.  The star-studded cast includes Derek Jacobi as Claudius, Kate Winslet as Ophelia, and Branagh, himself, as Hamlet, all parts delivered with brilliant authenticity.  Other well known actors such as Robin Williams, Charlton Heston, and Billy Crystal also appear in small, but equally well-implemented roles.  Some argue that Branagh's execution of the part was overdone, but it fits perfectly within the film and is, therefore, quite believable.  The acting is overall a big plus to the end effect of the film.  Beautifully executed in an outstandingly well-calculated manner, Branagh's film made Hamlet  more accessible to modern viewers and will certainly remain popular for a long time to come.
0786867973|4.0|While the author's first book, How To Eat, gave an overview of the entire cooking process with some desserts thrown in, How to be a Domestic Goddess focuses entirely on baking. Being a domestic goddess she says, (and I paraphrase) is returning to a basic love for cooking minus the hassles of daily life.<br />Lawson's trademarks are evident here with her conversational style and easy to follow recipes - (you must try the dense (fallen)chocolate cake: it is superb). Aside from the usual baking sections, there is a chapter devoted to recipes that children will have fun helping out with as well as a holidays section.<br />This book is hardback and printed on beautiful glossy paper. The photos are well-lighted and look so real that they jump off the page and will make you rush to your kitchen. This is definitely a better and more focused book than How To Eat (but then again, I prefer to bake!).
B000001EAQ|1.0|My absolute favorite band in the world.  It did not dawn on me how horrible this offering was until U2 finally released &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind.&quot;  I kept this CD, only because I am a true fan. &quot;Mofo&quot; and possibly &quot;Staring At the Sun&quot; are the only salvation to this crap!  The latter part of the CD is complete crap. Sort of like some of early Pink Floyd's worst songs. Many of the reviews have suggested that this is innovative and groundbreaking.  This is a step in neither direction.  U2 capitalized on their career with &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby.&quot;  Zooropa was marginal, in that it was experimental and offered some excellent songs, while  putting some very filler stuff on it.  Their heads got too big!!  I gave this CD another chance after listening to their latest offering, &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind,&quot; and I see how desparation was amongst them with this release.  They should have made the fanbase wait much longer before putting this depression-induced disappointment out.  Every band, even as high a caliber as U2, has to go through a terrible period/album.  If it is possible that this wonderous band made a mistake, this is it!!  Check out the newest offering and all other offerings, but stay away from this one!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Gone in 60 Seconds is one of those wonderful movies that really makes you wish you were doing something else with your life. In the same way that Top Gun made you want to become a fighter pilot, Gone in 60 Seconds will have you contemplating taking part in some serious grand theft auto. Which, in retrospect, is perhaps not such a good thing. <br />Nicolas Cage is Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines, a retired car thief persuaded to come back for one last boost to get his younger brother Kip out of trouble with the local gangsters. His objective is to steal fifty cars in just one night, including his unicorn; a 1967 Ford Mustang named Eleanor which he has never been able to get away with before. It's not long before he has assembled his old gang (along with a few new members) and they begin to work out how exactly they are going to pull this off. Pursuing them every step of the way is grizzled Detective Castlebeck (Delroy Lindo) and a gang of rival car thieves angered that Raines got the big job instead of them. <br />The cast is large and varied. Nicolas Cage (The Rock, Con Air) is perfectly at home as Memphis Raines, at first reluctant to take on the job but gradually warming to his old life. As he brushes off his old car-stealing gear and holds up his leather jacket, he says with a touch of vanity and self-mockery, &quot;I am a ba-ad man.&quot; <BR>Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider) is the token love interest Sway, who is included in the group because she's an expert with Ferrari's. In reality, she doesn't really do much except stand around and pout quite a lot. <BR>Former soccer hard man Vinnie Jones (Snatch) is the silent but hard-as-nails Sphinx. Although he only actually says one sentence at the end of the film, his mere presence provides some great moments. Note his reaction when he finds a dog has eaten his car keys. <BR>Robert Duvall (Falling Down, Sixth Day), as old mechanic Otto, brings more dignity than the film really deserves, with his usual quiet and understated performance. Out of all the characters, his is probably the only one which bears a resemblance to a real person. <BR>Giovani Ribisi (Saving Private Ryan) plays young Kip Raines. To be honest, he's quite annoying, both as an actor and as a character, consistently squelching through his lines. It's to Cage's credit that he manages not to look too annoyed with the guy. <br />But for all the characters in the film, they are more or less superfluous to the cars themselves. That much is obvious when we first see Eleanor, as the camera pans lovingly over the cars bodywork. <BR>The first half of the movie is mostly exposition, with Memphis being incredibly organised and clever. There is a fairly standard chase and fight scene early on, just to keep the action level up. It's a Bruckheimer film, don't you know! It's really the last twenty minutes where the film really, please excuse the pun, shifts into top gear. <br />As Memphis desperately tries to steal Eleanor (the last car on the list) with Castlebeck and an army of cops in hot pursuit. The final car chase is truly a job to behold, perfectly staged and executed, long and varied, and underscored with the ultra cool music score. Cars crash, but interestingly do not explode, which is rare for a Bruckheimer film. Still, it also ensures that none of the good guys get hurt.<BR>It's kind of a shame that after such an adrenaline fuelled burning of rubber, the film ends in a fairly standard gunfight that lacks any sense of tension. After all he's been through, you know that Memphis won't come to harm. <br />I gave this film five stars because, even though some of the characters grate and the plot isn't very strong, it's just impossible not to love this film. Although Bruckheimer has never been one for deep characterisations or subtle sub-plots, by God he knows how to get the pulses racing. This movie is an essential buy for anyone that knows a quality film.
B00003CX95|5.0|I've seen the movie Bravehear over 100 times, and recently purchased it on DVD. It is, in my opinion, the best movie ever. I know most  every line in the movie and am a fan of Mel Gibson. <BR>     The movie is graphic but very exciting and while William Wallace is an extrodanary person, he is very a believable character. While I am sure there are some falsifications, I know there was a lot of truth to it. <BR>    Every time I hear the Freedom speech I still get chills down my spine, even though I know every word to it. It is a movie that evokes pride from any patriot, and its no wonder it won multiple Academy Awards. (5 I think) Anyways, Every one should see it once, and every one that does see it once probably wants to see it again.
B000053V7Q|5.0|Buy the DVD, sit down, close your eyes, listen....!! Pure joy !! The sound quality is close to perfect (especially the concert) as is the video footage. This is Elvis at his best and he is in nearly every scene (and in his best form ever). I cannot recommend this enough, especially if you want a true account of what it was like to be at an Elvis concert.<br />Just buy it !!
B00005QDW5|5.0|i never really saw the need for a greatest hits collection of pink floyd - all of their albums work so well on their own merit. and as i have all of their cd's i never thought i would buy one. listening to this cd however is almost like a experiencing some of this music for the first time. it is really amazing how some of the older songs blend in with the newer music. this cd is like listening to the soundtrack of a floyd film that never was, a very enjoyable experience. highly recommended even if you have all of their music.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The makers of this film squandered an opportunity to use modern film making technology to chronicle for a new generation one of history's most compelling stories. Instead, we got a trite love story/soap opera and a ridiculous series of events with the lead character (Ben Affleck) fighting the Battle of Britain, fighting the Japanese at Pearl Harbor (while reminding me of scenes and dialog from TOP GUN), and then bombing Tokyo. As a career Naval Aviator and student of history, I found the events depicted in a manner so inaccurate (read: \\"Hollywood\\") as to be insulting to the participants. I found the choice of Alec Baldwin to play Col. Dolittle especially revolting. There would have been more than enough drama in the truthful and accurate representation of some of the most significant events in our history...it's a shame the makers chose to make a film of this disappointing caliber.
B00005KHLV|2.0|Ill keep this short as to not offend the cult following which this film has obviously attracted.<BR>Frankly, this movie goes no where. But then people will argue 'its not supposed to go &quot;anywhere&quot;', and that its a look into the lives of two people struggling to hide their feelings for each other amidst a tangle of deteriorating marriages.<BR>Oh Boo Hoo<BR> <BR>Wong Kar-Wai, the producer, script writer and director decided to make this movie as an experiment, by 'going with the flow of the movie' rather than following traditional film making procedures and steps. <BR>Its not blantantly obvious that people started filming this movie before the script was finished. But the movie is deeply affected by this fact.<br />There is a large amount of tedious scenes which seem directionless, only to be explained later on because i guess Kar-Wai had decided that too many of such scenes were ambiguous or had no correlation to the plot at all. <BR>In fact most of the scenes are just a jumble of meaningless actions. Im sure most people will complain about that last sentence saying 'oh but it symbolised the lost hope of so and so' or ' it helped create an atmosphere of sexual tension and blah blah'.<br />Im sorry im just not the sort of person who thinks 'oh but that fork on the table represents the lost universal love they must feel for each other'. Ok thats a bit of an exaggeration. But you get my point.<br />Also the ending kinda predictable, and kinda corny. All the tedious plot building sequences lead to a rather quick and undramatic ending. <br />Generous 2 stars
B0000025R3|5.0|1981 well wasn't that a great year.  I left high school in '81 and grew up listening to this and really loved it back then. Still have the vinyl that doesn't get out very often so 20 years down the track guess it's about time to buy the cd. This stuff is ageless and I enjoy it just as much now as then and guess it takes me back to my youth a bit. Down by the Sea, Be Good Johnny , Down Under and Who can it be now?,  every time I hear them brings back great memories and every time I listen to them now makes more great memories. A must for anyone who appreciates great music, good times and good friends.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There's a lot I like going on here:  Iggy (vocals), the Replacments (vocals, lyrics); the Modern Lovers and Sleater-Kinney (vocals and arrangements); most of the New York punk gods (Velvets, Ramones, Blondie, and esp. Television-type guitars), a little Devo and the Cars; Pavement, Sebadoh, and the whole lo-fi thing;  I think, though,  my number one perceived Strokes influence has to be the Feelies - I thought they were all over this record.<br />And, by the way, I loved it.  Best rock record of the year, if not for the White Stripes.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Every Pop and Hip Hop fan must get this CD. \\"Britney\\" is my choice if u want a album that you can dance and freestyle too. <BR>This album shows a maturity to Ms. Spears and its done well. With 5 songs written by Spears, this is her most personal and best album yet. The album kicks off with \\"I'm a slave 4 u\\" by the Neptunes is about wanting to tell the world your old enough to step into a club, and being a slave to the music. Britney also has a more rock sound in this album with a song she wrote called \\"Lonely\\" which has a hard guitar in the choruses and also a excellent cover of \\"I Love rock n roll\\" which is better than the cover she did for \\"(I can't get no) Satisfaction\\". <BR>All of the songs are my favorite but the tracks that stands out are \\"Boys\\" another Neptune penned track with a more hip hop vibe than \\"i'm a slave 4 U\\". \\"Bombastic love\\" which sound like your watching a horror movie seeing Frankenstein brought to life by Britney, \\"Cinderella\\", and \\"what's it like to be me\\", which has a rock opera feel and was written by Justin Timberlake and Wade Robson. This album shows that Britney will be around longer than you think.<BR>You should also check out \\"Mandy Moore\\"'s self titled album which is also a winner in my list.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I watched Shrek with my 3 year old sone when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it tremendously.  I could not wait to get the tape--it is a masterpiece worth having in your video library even if you do not have kids.<br />The story about the unfriendly ogre in search and defence of his privacy is very cute.  Trying to save his swamp-home from the invasion of the fairy tales creatures, Shrek goes on a quest to save a princess. He meets a talking donkey who decides that Shrek would be his friend.  The journey is quite funny and the happy ending quite unconventional.<br />There are several things that make this movie superb entertainment:<BR>1. It is movie for kids and adults alike.  The fairy tale story line is fun for the kids.  The various puns, allegories and jokes are fun for the adults.  Do not be misled by the fact that it is animation--it is not a cheesy, all-cute Disney type feature.  On the contrary, it makes fun of features like that.<BR>2. The animation is great.  The 3D animation is superb--detailed, bright and realistic (as realistic as an ogre can be)<BR>3. The voices of the actors are excellent.  Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphie and Cameron Diaz do a great job giving the characters a life of their own.  Especially Eddie Murphy.<BR>4. Finally, the sound track is so much fun, I had to get the CD as well.
0345451325|5.0|Being excited about Halo on the Xbox, I had to pick this book up to get a little more background information on the game.  Most books based on games are usually poorly written or just altogether bland. Not so with this book.  From the prologue to the final pages I was never bored.  Fans of the Ender series or Heinlein's Starship Troopers will really enjoy this book.  Bungie and Microsoft made a wise choice by publishing a sequel to the upcoming game, and Eric Nylund did an amazing job of making it all come to life.  After finishing this book, I know playing Halo will be a much more enjoyable experience.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Every fans of PF have already all these songs. Why the PF need this. They made a double live from 1980 one year ago and now this compilation. Gilmour ,what happens ? Cannot you write some new songs ? You are the best guitarist in the world (my opinion) and you play with your Fender one time by one decade. If it's not for the money, make it for your public...
B00004T8RK|3.0|Well I'm a big 'ol Pearl Jam fan..I do even like this album, but rarely listen to it.  It doesn't completely just blow like I first thought it did..but it's close to.  I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could have..and that hurts my Pearl Jam pride but at least I admit it.  TONS of fans get VERY defensive about this album and try to talk it up, but I honestly feel they are in denial and just can't cope with speaking a bad word about anything Pearl Jam puts out.  The songs on here are good, but only good..nothing noteworthy, nothing spectacular...it has it's moments, but most albums do.  I was, and am, disspointed by this album.  <br />It is DEFINITLEY missing something that the other Pearl Jam albums had...the other albums had a 'culture' of their own, this one seems to copy the others and try to mix the styles, but poorly.  That's how I feel about it...and I've made PJ &quot;my band&quot; so to speak...this album ain't that grand.
B00005QDW5|5.0|first of all this is a must have for true Pink Floyd fans and even more so for those not into their music as it entales 26 cuts from 13 albums.Animals,Darkside of the moon,wish you were here,the Wall,Meddle to name a few,not to mention the soundtrack from the movie The Wall.this is David Gilmore,Roger Waters,Nick Mason,Richard Wright(Pink Floyd)at their best 2 and 1/2 hrs. worth.you get all 7 versions of Shine on you crazy diamonds not to mention a full 16+ min. of the title album.if its a 1st album you get the effect of the group full blast although I can't concieve of anyone just having one album from this great group.so in two words BUY IT you won't be sorry!I know this Floydian isn't however I admit that no compilation(hate that term)can replace full albums that Pink Floyd has done.each album consists of songs not heard on Echoes but to say Echoes has no merit would be a huge mistake even though the song Echoes itself isn't as long as it is on the Wall album so having said that I still say BUY IT and to borrow a line I hear often:I can only please one person per day and todays not your day and tommorrow doesn't look good either. all in all its not the blunder that some people may think but rather a taste of things to come should you be fortunate enough to be able to find and buy all their albums.so I'll close with two words. GOOD SHOW
B000000WA4|4.0|There's always this apprehension with multiple albums, be they on CD or vinyl; am I getting fair value for money (...) or not? How much of this is worth it and how much is self-indulgent (...)? It's no different with this sprawling set, but happily the gems are more prominent than the garbage. My choice for standouts: \\"Jellybelly,\\" \\"Zero,\\" \\"Here Is No Why\\" and \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" all strung together on the first CD make for a churning throb that's irresistable; \\"Thirty-Three,\\" \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\" and \\"Lily(My One And Only)\\" are by-God SONGS and well-performed, too: and the pacing of the whole thing really works well, with the lesser stuff carried along by the cuts that suceed. If you don't want to compare this album to the Beatles \\"White Album\\" or \\"Sandinista!\\" from The Clash, then just call it Billy Corgan's indulgence and revel in what works within it. Yes, it's worth the money!
B000000W9Z|4.0|I've read some of the other reviews, and I can agree with some, but not with all. I'm a huge fan of Bowie's, and the extra story added in Outside kept me interested in all the songs.  Some of the segues are creepy, but very entertaining.  The added song from Japanese version, &quot;Get Real&quot; is very funny.  This album is worth having.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Many groups around Christmas time release a quick buck Greatest Hits package.Now it seems some groups are using this as a way to sell their latest single.Some groups are even releasing greatest hits packages even though they've only 2 proper albums.After 34 years of being in the business Pink Floyd have finally released a greatest hits package-but this isn't your average collection.I suppose Pink Floyd were never your average group.<br /> Slipshod collection this isn't.Firstly the group has taken particular to sequence these songs so that it seems like you're listening to a proper album and not just a few tracks selected from some 11 albums.Each track leads into the next one with consumate craft and skill that this group are renowned for.Secondly even the album cover has managed to incorporate little snippets from each of the previous albums and it must represent one of the very best greatest hits album covers of all time.Thirdly even though Syd Barrett may have alienated himself from the rest of the group,he is still given the honour of his songs opening and closing the album.<br /> It's impossible to pick out favourite tracks on this album.People will have their own favourite Floyd albums and I suppose it is representative of their most popular albums that &quot;Dark Side...&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; are the 2 dominant albums on this c.d.&quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; may only have 2 tracks but considering one of them is the 17 minutes of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond',you'd have to say that this album is well represented too.If I were to pick a fault it would be that 1 track from Animals is not enough and yet 3 tracks from Division Bell may be a bit excessive.But there is no way with a back catalogue like this group have that you could please everyone.<br /> I suppose there has come a stage in every music fans lifetime when the music of Pink Floyd will touch you and bring back very special memories.Instrumentally they were relaxing,they were melodic,they werebrilliant musicians,they brought you to places you never expected to really get to.Lyrically they were humorous,thought provoking,angry and mellow but most of all they had a sophistication that make many groups now seem almost illiterate.You never described Floyd as having 'songs'-they're always a 'tracks' group-but tracks like 'Another Brick In The Wall' or 'Wish You Were Here' are truly memorable songs that we've all sung along to at one stage or another.<br /> C.D. 1 is excellent-from the psychedellic haze of the opening song-to the sixties moog Doors meet The Kinks sound of the second song-when you hear tracks from Division Bell you see how much this group have evolved.What soon becomes obvious is that Roger Waters was at the heart of Floyds most interesting period.This side also features two of the best tracks 'Money' and of course 'Brick In The..'.It also features the wondrous 16 mins of 'Echoes' taken from the '71 album Meddle.'Sheep' the only track from the amazing &quot;Animals&quot; c.d. features on this c.d. also.<br /> The 2nd c.d. to me is simply sensational.'Shine On You Crazy...' is represented in one memorable chunk here as opposed to the album proper where it's broken up into 2 sections.It's 17 minutes of ambient,dreamy melodic bliss.This surely was Dave Gilmours finest guitar moment.Then we go into Dark Sides other most memorable track 'Time'.The hard hitting totally 80's lyrics of track 3.Then it  mixes in to 'Comfortably Numb' my favourite moment from &quot;The Wall&quot;.The amazing instrumental track 6 taken from '71's &quot;Meddle&quot;-in production stakes alone this group were light years ahead of the rest.Then their best track(and probably their most commercial) from the 80's-'Learning To Fly'.Finally the contrast of the last 2 tracks-high-tech,crisp,pessimistic sound of '94's Division Bell to the folksy,optimistic quirkiness of Barrett's 'Bike' from '67.What a finale!What a history!
B000002AZ8|2.0|I find it incredible that PJ fans who loved Ten (like myself) would like anything that came after that album.  I simply don't \\"get it\\" like some of you seem to.  Every song on Ten would seem out of place on every album that followed.  One reason why PJ has lost it's fans and it's status as the premiere  band of the 90's almost as soon as it recieved it is because it has no set style.  When Ten came out it flowed.  Every song was either angry, beautiful or a mixture of both in most cases.  Now it seems like they are trying hard not to sound like anything.  Every album is an evolution into something else that is further away from the \\"Seattle sound\\".  What was wrong with the \\"Seatle Sound\\"?  Creed is often said to be a PJ (...) .  If they are, then they are a (...) of the PJ that created TEN.  If you look at Creeds sales they are the biggest band now.<br />The most critically acclaimed albums of all time were huge sellers.  Thriller, The Wall, Led Zeppelin 4.  So the masses have a tendency to be right in a lot of cases.  Some of you are so artsy fartsy that you have convinced yourselves to love (...)music for the sake of being different than the masses.  Make no mistake, PJ sucks now.  The music they make doesn't flow at all as an album.  That's why they went from selling 10 million to 5 million to 3 million to 2 million to 1 million to who even cares if a Pearl Jam CD comes out.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Having seemingly taken over the world with her first two albnums<BR>of Max Martin-produced uber-pop, Britney Spears returns with a clutch of songs that see her adding a few fresh ingredients to her formula, resulting in her most cohesive record to date. Though it falters occasionally, when it's good, it's VERY good. In addition to the ubiquitous Martin, she's managed to corral several hitmaking maestros, including the Neptunes and Rodney Jerkins in an attempt to add a little R&amp;B to the mix. The results work more often than not. The Prince-ly sounding 'I'm A Slave 4 U', the first of the two Neptunes tracks, is arguably her most adult-sounding single yet, working up a nice funky groove(even if the moans and groans provided by Spears are laughable)and, despite its' tepid reception, is just as good,if not better than some of her previous work. The other Neptunes'<BR>song,'Boys',is nothing more than the latest in a long line of jailbait anthems--the music's great, but the lyrics are ridiculously silly and once again sees Spears straddling the line between good girl and bad girl--she's a &quot;nice girl&quot;one second, the next she wants to turn the dancefloor into &quot;our own little nasty world&quot;--yeah, okay. Jerkins, on the verge of late of rendering himself irrelevant, redeems himself here with a couple of strong moments in 'Lonely' and 'Let Me Be'(though I think we all could have lived without the 'I Love Rock N Roll'cover, as Spears has neither the swagger nor attitude to completely pull it off). Pop upstarts Brian Kierulf and Josh Schwartz provide two of the records very best tracks--the discofied 'Anticipating' and the garage-styled ballad 'That's Where You Take Me', both of which showcase Spears to far better effect than the R&amp;B tracks do. And if you can get past the awkward title, 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman'(cowritten by Dido)provides something rarely heard in Spears' music--sincerity and heart. It's easily the album's best track, and just might be her best record ever. The remainder of the Martin tracks('Overprotected', 'Cinderella', and 'Bombastic Love')are, unusually, probably the most disposable cuts, as they all have a sameness often found in Martin's song, only this time to a greater degree. Even with that said, this still constitutes Spears' most consistent recording to date, but she has a LONG way to go before she can even consider living up to those ridiculous Madonna comparisons.
B00005A46T|5.0|It just ticks me off to see these little techno-electronica, clubby freaks write reviews about a band they don't really appreciate. Slipknot is a band that is very original, Lyrics wise, Vocals wise and instruments wise. Back in the late eighties early nineties, there were bands like Deicide that presented a unique, awesome sound and vocals, but lyrics were a problem to understand over the vocalist's grunt. Slipknot and Disturbed for instance, brought a sound that was uniquely different, & identyfing, that could be thoroughly heard and understood. Whenever you hear a song from Slipknot or Disturbed you will never forget it. If you know the band, you'll recognize the music. Now, how many bands can you say that about nowadays? You have bands like Cold and Creed whose vocalists sound identical, but most (...) out there listen to them because it's the \\"in\\" thing. Check out a real band sometime.If you like this music and are a \\"REAL\\" metal fan, check out Disturbed (Favorite band), Godsmack, Linkin Park and also check out System of a Down,(CHOP SUEY RULES!) and for those of you who like not too heavy rock, and are more into lyrics, vocals and good sound, listen to Anathema,(Judgement Album),Deftones, and NickelBack . (...)
B000002U8G|5.0|this to me is the best floyd album of all time .well you say why not dark side huh?well because this is an album they all wrote together and this is the one that defined there sound as the band everyone one would soon to know the next 30 years.to start off you have ''one of these days'' which is the greatest experimental 2 bass song i have every heard . with so much dynamics from just a rideing a pass line you wonder how the song goes through so many changes with the one line in the song ''one of these days im going to cut you into little pieces'' you wonder if they were maybe talking about listening to music and taking so seriously it would drive someone to that point??...then you have''pillow of winds'' which happens to be the sweetest guitar meddely i have ever heard with a wonderfull vocal by gilmore .it sounds like they used this same guitar idea on other classics on the wall and wish you were here.then you have the best song that no one ever talks about ''fearless''.that song should of been on there new greatest hits compilation it was a hit not a radio hit but a song that shows them as great song writers.then you have the song ''san tropez'' which is a funny little ditty. kind of a rag of sorts for being king of famous(which was before they were)then the fun blues song ''seamus'' what more could you ask for from a blues song then having a dog howl in the background.just a fun one.then of course there best song/anthem /suite of all time ''echoes''!!!.its a 23 min song that a small journey into the relms of the heart of this band that has only been done this once ,there best long song.(if you would like to see a great visual to this great song find a copy of 2001 and start the song right when the seuqence for jupiter in the infidinte starts it fits nicely and its exactly as long as the song)strange or fiction weird)but any way this is just a great album that has captured every focused emotion that this band had to offer.when they were a band in search of an idenity and defining the sound of music......nity and defining the sound of music......
B00003CXDZ|5.0|If you have not seen Moulin Rouge, you are missing out on the movie of the year!  I must admit, when my husband suggested we see Moulin Rouge, I adamantly protested.  I normally like suspense, thriller or horror movies.  I did not want to see a musical/romance!  Well, I went, dragging my feet, and it was one of the best choices I've ever made!  The movie was/is fantastic!  It is not your average musical.  It is fast-paced, stunning, beautiful and sad, all at once.  There is so much for the eye to take in.  I have seen it 4 times, and I'm sure there are still things that I missed.  You may call me obsessed, but it is truly the best movie I have ever seen.  Baz Luhrmann is a genius!  He could not have chosen better actors for his masterpiece.  Do not see the movie with any expectations, except to be awestruck, because it will not be what you expected! As I said, I've seen it 4 times, and at the end of each time I sat  stunned, unable to move, filled with joy, sadness, awe and admiration, all at once.  I definitely give it 5+ stars!
6304936303|4.0|Y'know, when it comes to action flicks, there's just some occasions where you gotta just kick back and enjoy one of the genre's sillier offerings. One with plenty of the standard cliches and ridiculously implausible, over-the-top moments. And plenty of snappy patter &amp; crackin' wise, too. Oh, and howzabout having our two protagonists be a pair of broken-down &amp; disgraced former `heroes' who don't particularly care for each other at first, but then start to bond as the flick plays on, leading to what looks like a lasting friendship in the end? Throw in an opening credits sequence featuring a pretty good ape of Hank Williams Jr's Monday Night \\"Are You Ready For Some Football?\\" song, one of Halle Berry's earliest roles (where she's practically nekkid, no less!), a ballistic hand-puppet show, and Satan Claus, you get- well, you get something else to see besides... um... all that other stuff! <br />The big attraction is the echange of the aforementioned \\"witty\\" one-liners &amp; banter between our anti-heroes, P.I. Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis) and former pro QB Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans), as they take out just about every bad guy in their way to get to the big man (which is, like, a totally new idea in action cinema... heh). Their romp through the body count features plenty of meaty head-shots &amp; explosions. Which is the usual Bruce Willis action-flick fare, as most `Die Hard' freakos know. Throw in a deadly serious, yet fun-loving &amp; slightly fem henchman, and a rebellious, foul-mouthed adolescent daughter who manages to tag along and get herself in big trouble, and you have... well, sort of a cross between `Lethal Weapon' and `Die Hard'. Which is no surprise, really, considering this movie's co-producer, Joel Silver, also watched over all four \\"Lethal\\"s and the first two \\"Die Hard\\"s. Throw in \\"Lethal\\" 1 &amp; 2 scribe Shane Black, and you'll understand why Hallenbeck's &amp; Dix's back-and-forth sniping features many uncanny similarities to those legendary Riggs-and-Murtaugh dialogue duels. The fact that Willis is playing a part that's very similar to his \\"Die Hard\\" character McClane doesn't clear things up too much, either. Kinda makes one wonder whether or not this movie was originally conceptualized as a possible DH or LW follow-up, but didn't quite cut the mustard with the powers behind either franchise... <br />...Whoa, I'm giving this WAY too much analysis, which means I'd better get into the DVD special features before I make things even more complex. Actually, aside from a trailer and brief cast &amp; crew filmographies &amp; career bios, there's not much to this particular platter. One side features `LBS' in widescreen, the other in full-screen pan &amp; scan. You know, just in case those black bars on the top &amp; bottom are too much of a distraction. And, as expected from Warner's home video division, the DVD is stored in a cardboard snap case, rather than a plastic keep case like EVERY OTHER STUDIO uses for their digital disc releases, so don't be expecting too much long-term durability from this particular offering's packaging. <br />So, in conclusion, if you're looking for a sort of dumb actioner (well, more so than usual anyway) with plenty of really ridiculously implausible moments &amp; really big exit wounds, `The Last Boy Scout' might just be what you've been looking for! Just put it on your Xmas list, and if you're really good this year, maybe Satan Claus- whoops, SaNtA Claus- will deliver it to you for yuletide! <br />`Late
B00005QDW5|3.0|For some reason, this cd just seemed a little pointless to me. This is Pink Floyd's 3rd release in a row with zero new material. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great. That's not why this cd only got 3 stars from me. If you already have most Pink Floyd cds, or the box set, then there's absolutely no reason to buy this. The only thing that's different here is &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;. The entire song is one instead of split in half as it appears on WYWH. Also, &quot;Echoes&quot; is slightly shortened from 23 minutes to 15 minutes.<BR>As for the choice of songs, I was disappointed to see nothing from More, Obscured By Clouds, or Atom Heart Mother. I really think they should have tried to add the song &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, a great Floyd track and a very overlooked track. On the other hand, I'm glad to see a few songs from the Division Bell, Pink Floyd's all-time best. <BR>Only buy this cd if you don't already have any Pink Floyd. Even then, you'll still have to buy Ummagumma, More, Atom Heart Mother, and Obscured By Clouds since all 4 of these albums were overlooked.
B00005QIPH|1.0|First of all, anyone who was around to enjoy the bands that the strokes are aping will either be nauseated by this, or think: wow, another rip off band. They're probably to the same effect as green day imitating &quot;punk.&quot; Those who jumped in on the bandwagon late in the game and never had a band to call their own that &quot;hit it big&quot; .. .. .. well here ya go! This is it! A band that has 'popular' built into their music before it is even released. They are on Conan O'Brien when they only have an EP out! Awesome! Something to tell the kids because it needs to be popular to be recognizable, and recognizable is good!<br />That's exactly it. The new &quot;hype.&quot; Ride it! Go see some mediocre, boring &amp; stagnant music, get the gratingly bizarre presentation of mimicry that is the album, get a tatoo &amp; jacket patch, share a new band with your friends.<br />Does that mean it's good? If you listen to a lot of records this isn't interesting in the slightest.<br />I'd rather listen to the bands they copy, at least I get a sense of modern creation from them, rather than postmodern posing.<br />I'm not saying they sound like VU or ramones or anything. . . that's what they're *TRYING* to sound like, but they sound flat. They're missing an actual socioeconomic structure that they shared with their fans. . . <br />so, their fans must be industry pimps, dolts who don't know much about music, or people who like bands that imitate/sound like bands. The sarcasm of that statement rules out the &quot;liking them because they imitate&quot; but I hesitate to declare that because I've seen people post their reviews that say &quot;70% VU, 10% ICP, 5% Krokus, 2% ZZ TOP&quot; what EVER... what are they 100%? <br />they are 100% imitation. There is nothing &quot;derivative&quot; of singing like neil diamond over boring 3 chord progressions with 4/4 drums. <br />There are plenty of bands updating the music that this band is shoplifting. Hell, some of the bands that theestrokes are biting are still around: Fugazi has a new one, New Order . . . etc.<br />bottom line: they are all rich &amp; the lead singer's father owns elite modeling agency. <br />&quot;Daddy, can I have a band for my birthday?&quot;
079213690X|5.0|I've seen this picture about a hundred thousand times, and it still gives me a tickling sensation and goosebumps. My heart pounds, my adrenaline flows; my body foolishly prepares for battle. It makes me want to grunt as loud as I can. The battle scenes in this movie are that darn good. It's never portrayed as a good thing to fight for the sake of fighting. It's the good fight: against an evil tyrant. This good vs. evil theme is present throughout the movie along with the stereotypes of being a poor working-class man. (How many peasants spoke Latin then?)

B00003CX9E|5.0|The AFI (American Film Institute) said that this is the best American film ever.  They were close.  Citizen Kane isn't only the greatest American movie ever, it's the best movie ever.  Period.  And not because of all the hype, camera work, editing, make-up, special effects, and directing; but because of the acting and screenplay.  For two hours you don't see Orson Welles as Orson Welles, you see him as Charles Foster Kane.  The lost little boy who is incapable of love until he finds his rosebud.  And the story.  The way Welles left a trail of bread crumbs for us to follow that led nowhere.  This film represents what a true movie is.  It gives you all the questions, but not even half of the answers.  We all know what rosebud is, but who was Charles Foster Kane?  We'll never know for sure.  Go buy this movie and see if you can find out.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is one of the greatest live shows I have ever seen, it shows the masterpiece Scenes from a Memory in whole and helps the viewer understand the story more. I have watched over and over again, and get chills every time.. Do yourself a favor and buy this one, no regrets believe me....<br />And to ERIC if you read this Dream Theater are not Berkley graduates thier Berkley dropouts as they all met there except James, and Jordan. They are still faithful to the school doing clinics and speaking to the students but never graduated.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I'm rather tired of reading all the reviews whining that this album is not like &quot;All For You&quot; or that a certain song is not like a more uptempo song on one of her previous albums. &quot;All For You&quot; was the album that introduced me to Diana Krall, and I think it's a great album as well. But vocal jazz is more than &quot;Errand Girl For Rhythm&quot; and &quot;Hit That Jive Jack&quot; just like Dave Brubeck is more than &quot;Take Five&quot; or Beethoven is more than his Fifth Symphony. Some songs are uptempo, some are mellow, some are somber, some are slow-paced - that's how music is, kids, and that's what's so great about it. Claiming to be a jazz lover, then saying that the 3rd song sounds like the 2nd, the 4th like the 3rd, etc., is a cop out, like people who say they don't like classical because &quot;it's boring and it all sounds the same&quot;. Diana Krall has always had a great voice, and, as she has continued to record albums, she has continued to refine her style and her skills. I have only listened to this album twice, but I find all the negative comments about it to be ignorant at best and immature and asinine at worst.
B00000JCB2|1.0|limp bizkit is pathetic.  If it wasn't for durst, they'd be almost decent.  durst couldn't lyricize his way past a second grade spelling test.  &quot;give it all for the nookie so you can take that cookie&quot;  ooooh...poignant.  &quot;stuck my tender heart in a blender&quot;  wait...this IS limp bizkit and not eve 6, right?  and don't get me started on &quot;break stuff.&quot;  The sad part is, durst actually thinks he's original.  Too bad most of the music press believes him.  Guess they've never heard of bad brains, faith no more, or even red hot chilli peppers, etc., etc., etc. At least now with wes leaving this band i can  honestly say they're completely worthless.
B00004XOWM|1.0|(...) if this isn't the band's worst album, i don't know  how you get much worse.  to say that bizkit is still cutting-edge and that anything durst has to say is meaningful outside of his own angsty juvenile poser-world is laughable.  i'm sick of hearing durst whine about how critics hate his music when rolling stone is shoving positive reviews down readers' throats.  if you want \\"nu-metal\\" that isn't tainted by it's front man's delusions of grandeur, try Linkin Park, Lifer, or early Incubus.  without wes, it'll be interesting to see if bizkit's next album is even listenable.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This has to be one the greatest films of all time. The acting was amazing, and I hope to see more from Marlon Wayans as a dramatic actor in the future,  Ellen Burstyn was fantastic and was robbed for best actress.

The beloved Live at Leeds with it's unique and wonderful sound and excellent engineering and recording values now finally with the best version of Tommy ever released.  I like this version because of the sound, the performance AND the crowd.  It was a unique setting and the venue and audience affected the performance positively.  Sure, I'd like to hear Tanglewood, maybe even San Fran '71 or a later-era show would have been good for variety, but (...)it!

6303477259|5.0|Absolutely stunning, literally mind-boggling visuals. The cameras swoop around and yet always seem to be pointing at the right member of the band (or the backup singers) at the right time.. David Gilmour's guitar playing.. well what can you say?  He can make those strings sing, soar, weep, moan, and ring like no one since Jimi.. and he does it with such a totally effortless look on his face.. there are few guitar players on this planet who can equal him..<br />For a bit of fun - compare how Floyd looks today with how they looked in their 20s on the Pompeii Video.. these are guys in their fifties who are obviously having so much damn fun doing what they do, and they do it so well, like they can read each other with a simple glance across the stage.. Richard Wright and Nick Mason, while overshadowed by Gilmour's up front stage center star presence, are equally masters of their instruments..<br />There's not a missed note or a flub in two hours of video as they run the gamut through their long repetoire of spacy, searing, haunting songs..<br />If you're a fan of Pink Floyd, and you have a VHS HiFi deck hooked up to a good stereo, this is a tape you simply must buy and you will show off your system to your friends with it over and over again.  When I watch it, I simply can't help smiling..
B000002L9Y|4.0|Hard album to review mainly because of the facts that surrounded its making, &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; was built from the pieces of an original Lindsey Buckingham solo record, and with the additions of several compositions by female songwriters/singers Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks, turned out to be the fifth studio album coming from the &quot;Rumours&quot; incarnation. Having very interesting musical moments, and showing the abbilities of Buckingham as a brilliant pop producer, &quot;Tango&quot; somehow just doesn't have the extraordinary mix of feelings that made albums such as &quot;Rumours&quot; or &quot;Tusk&quot; be mainstream successes. More over, this CD showcases the moment of a pop band submerged into the intrincated music map of the late 80's, and one gets a better impression out of it when reviewing the musical side of it.<br />Legendary pop star Stevie Nicks was worried about getting out of the world of drugs (who can blame her), and so her contributions to the album are only a few. Apart from his clear backing vocals on &quot;Little Lies&quot;, we don't hear much of her on the rest of the album, and her wonderful single &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; (one of the most poetic songs ever recorded) wasn't even written by her, the lyrics being composed by Stevie's friend Sandy Stewart. That song and &quot;Welcome To The Room... Sara&quot;, however, are two of the album's highlights for giving us the power to return to the years when Fleetwood Mac had this bewitched singer that could brighten the audiences with her poetic lyrics. &quot;Welcome&quot; features great vocal support from Lindsey and Christine. And then there's &quot;When I See You Again&quot;, in which we can hear one of Stevie's weakest lyrics ever... but then again is the musical arrangement what makes this song acceptable. Lindsey is great on his acoustic here, as is Christine on backing, making it a nice piece of work.<br />Guitarist Lindsey Buckingham dominates the album and delivers thestrongest composition and opener, the ambient rock track &quot;Big Love&quot;, which features his best lyrics on the album, good arrangements with guitar and the intrincated keyboard arrengements that were the trademark of the majority of the soft rock records in the 80's. &quot;Tango In The Night&quot; is brilliant mainly because of its musical construction, turning a soft pop song into almost a guitar opera, with strong guitar work and great percussion arrangements. But his other songs are not always satisfying: while &quot;Caroline&quot; features some strong arrangements, its lyrics are quite boring; the closer &quot;You And I Part II&quot;, co-written with Christine McVie, suffers from the same problem (good music, bad lyrics), and &quot;Family Man&quot; is simply unlistenable and plain silly. <br />But when you have three composers in a band, and two of them are not in their best moments, you have to be in luck and wait for the third of them to be there. And in my opinion, Christine's songs are what save this album from being an average 80's pop record and turn it into a classic. From the dreamy, legendary, trade-mark Fleetwood Mac track &quot;Everywhere&quot;, to the fast rocking, intense &quot;Isn't It Midnight&quot;, from the strong and huge mainstream success of the 80's anthem &quot;Little Lies&quot; to the charming &quot;Mystified&quot; (again co-written with Buckingham), Christine shines on &quot;Tango&quot;. Her gentle voice fits in perfectly with the arrangements, and her warm songs are always welcomed when the obvious expectative of the album is to be a 'dreamy' record. <br />Mainly the singles (&quot;Big Love&quot;, &quot;Little Lies&quot;, &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;, &quot;Everywhere&quot;) are the most important thing on the album. Those are on the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD. So buy this one only if you are interested in getting deeply into this band's music. For the casual listener, &quot;listen to the wind on the water&quot;, skip this one and stick with &quot;Rumours&quot;, &quot;Tusk&quot; and even &quot;The Dance&quot; first. This one, being a good album, is not the best of this legendary band.
B00004YW6I|5.0|If you have never listened to PJ Harvey before, this is a good place to start.  A VERY good place to start.  Stories From The City, Stories From the Sea is the probably the easiest PJ Harvey CD to listen to, without sacrificing depth and atmosphere.  As usual, her songs drip with emotion and energy.  This CD puts just about anything on the radio to shame, and remains miles ahead of her peers.  It is my favorite CD from the last few years...
B00005B74V|5.0|This remastered edition of the first Grace Slick-era Jefferson Airplane CD has great sound and a generous supply of additional non-LP tracks that make it a better buy than the domestic version. Snap it up!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I loved Roman movies since I was a kid.  If you are like me, this movie is a 10.  Really well done.  You will not be disappointed.
0871137380|5.0|This is a gripping read! Mark Bowden provides us with a detailed account of the 1993 horrific operation in Mogadishu that resulted in American soldiers dead and wounded. Before reading this book, the only memory or information I had about the event were the images of two American soldiers being dragged through the streets by the Somalians -- courtesy of CNN. <br />I read this book at the suggestion of my husband -- and only because he kept after me to do so. I am so glad that I did! This is a story about bravery, honor, and camaraderie. All of which are borne out of utter chaos. Everything that can go wrong during this operation does: two Black Hawk helicopters go down, people are dying, soldiers are going in the wrong direction, and supplies are scarce. The information about the Army Rangers and D-Boys is mind boggling. The next time I hear that our &quot;elite forces&quot; will be sent into battle, I will be hard pressed to forget that though highly skilled and trained, they are probably not much older that nineteen, twenty, or twenty one. <br />This book made me a nervous wreck while reading it -- you literally feel everyone's panic. I was constantly scrambling to find the diagrams and sort out where the various convoys and soldiers were located. I found I could not read it fast enough and was grateful for the snappy and easy to follow dialogue. <br />Well done Mark Bowden!!
B000006XDX|2.0|This was a strange time for Camel--the only real illusion this album has to being a Camel album is that Andrew Latimer is on every track.  The one highlight is Sasquatch.  Peter Bardens comes back to the fold to play some nice keyboards, supported by Anthony Phillips' (Genesis) twelve-string and Simon Phillips'(Jon Anderson's Animation, The Who, Mike Rutherford, etc.) amazing drum playing.  I got this album mostly because Anthony and Simon were on it, and thought there would be more great moments.  The official Camel web site talks about how fun this album was to make, and that energy does come through.  I just wish some more good music would have come out of it.  Camel is a great band, with their first 5 albums being extreme classics.  This album is mostly for someone wanting the entire Camel catalogue.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Now Britney Spears has a hot, sexy, more matue new image. Her maturity has also become more edvident in her vocal ability. Music wise the sound of this album is not as different in style to the last album (Oops!...) as I was expecting. Neverless this is a great album for the tyical Britney fan.
0375703861|5.0|This book is great, hilarious, realistic, complicated. <BR>Smith's book, a fast-moving if long novel, takes the reader helter-skelter through the lives of her mildly hyperbolic characters.<BR>Maybe it's a little long(hardly), but the culturally-loaded plot is fascinating and unpredictable. Aside from this, the book is worth reading for the humor alone. <BR>I was completely impressed(especially since she wrote it at age 24), and recommend it highly.
B00005R23S|5.0|For inspiration, for sweat, for a hard-working and tight band, for the very inner grit of what classic, stripped down rock and roll is all about, tap your feet and raise your glass to this wonderful concert keepsake.  Concert video's are a wonderful way to relive the magic created onstage, and Springsteen shows exactly why his reputation has been EARNED over so many years and so very many shows.  Kudos to the sparse stage providing excellent camera sight lines.  Good sonics with that usual Springsteen 'sound', just like we've come to recognize. A nice selection of songs, but with such a huge catalog, some of your favorites may have been left out.  The interaction among the band, the &quot;Preacher Bruce&quot; fervor, the solid musicianship all combine to make an excellent DVD review of the Springsteen concert experience. Recommended for both the hardcore and as an introduction for the novice.  Stuff this in someone's stocking!
B00005QDW5|5.0|I was a little concerned about the order of the track listing at first, and how the songs would flow from one to another, but someone obviously put a lot of thought into it because it moves very well. The track listing is a very good representation of Pink's history. There are a few omissions that I'd have liked to seen included, like PIGS from the ANIMALS album, MOTHER from THE WALL, and NOT NOW JOHN from THE FINAL CUT. Everyone has their favorites and this set is sure to miss a couple no matter what. I am disappointed that they didn't include CAREFUL WITH THAT AXE EUGENE, but that's my only real complaint. The remaster sound quality is excellent and will blow the speakers out of the best sound systems. All in all, a very good set. Kudos to Capitol Records!
6300213501|3.0|I have two words to say regarding this episode:  &quot;Acting Machine&quot;
B000002GA8|3.0|JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH is an amazing musical journey that mere words cannot describe. RICK WAKEMAN is awesome. The London Symphony Orchestra is awesome. Five stars all the way for the music. The sound quality of this CD is weak though, and lowers my overall rating of the CD. A&amp;M records needs to remaster this disc to improve the sound quality and while they're at it - include a full color booklet depicting all the original artwork from the album. That is when I'll want to plunk down my hard earned jack for this recording.
B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis has created the epitome of musical scores in this treasure. The only soundtrack that surpasses this is the rare bootleg import version that has all the music from the movie. I have that rare cd but i still listen to this disc more often because there are tracks here that were not included in the movie but should have been. Newly released tracks on here include the tracks: Rachel's Song, Wait For Me, Blush Response and Damask Rose. These are the most beautiful music pieces i have ever heard. They would have been perfect if included in the movie. That's what makes this release so special. The dialogue included is also very moving and takes you back to the film. I hate how reviewers complain about the song \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\" being on the soundtrack because it was used in the movie during the scene when Deckerd is sitting down at a restaurant eating sushi. The song doesn't bother me, it just pleasantly brings me back to the movie.<br />If i had to chose one cd in my entire collection to keep i would definately choose this one. It is priceless but very well priced here at amazon. I also recommend the rare Gongo import soundtrack which includes all the music from the film, 17 tracks.
B00005A1PR|4.0|India Arie has a wonderful voice. It's different and refreshing. Not many new artists get my attention and I must say that India earned it respectfully. I'm not gonna lie and say that every song is great BUT the majority is. My favorites are &quot;Ready For Love&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;Strength Courage and Wisdom&quot; and the ode to Stevie &quot;Wonderful&quot;. I also love the interludes with the guitar. Very, very, beautiful. Its not often that I can listen to interludes on a cd more than once. Acoustic Soul is a great album to get away from the monotonous music thats out now.
B00005OM4N|4.0|Britney Spears' third studio effort is without a doubt her most personal record (end therefore aptly titled `Britney'). Does this mean her style has shifted 100%? Did she make a little musical U-turn? <BR>Certainly while listening to the georgeous first single `I'm A Slave 4 U' and `Boys' one can't help but notice she gave her music a slight change of direction - both songs are produced by the brilliant urban duo The Neptunes (who previously worked with Kelis, P. Diddy and Usher among others). Another huge r&amp;b name featuring on several tracks is Rodney `Darkchild' Jerkins, who lent his amazing producing skills to artists ranging from Whitney Houston and Destiny's Child to, more recently, the Backstreet Boys and Michael Jackson. His distinctive sound defines the most part of this album. It's radio friendly, dancy pop - but with a clean-cut edge.<BR>One of 2000's most shining musical revelations, the British Dido, cowrote Britney's next single `I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman'. It's a touching, very emotional song for the young star, telling us she's seen \\"more than you know\\" and that she \\"needs time\\" and \\"a moment of mine\\". Britney's moved from the cheezy (yet incredibly catchy) pop to a little more street cred. The Lolita-innocence's still here though...<BR>So, will this record alienate her loyal fan base? Personally I don't think so. There are some good quality tracks here (considering the type of music we're talking about, of course) and for those of you hesistating: Britney still rocks! I think her new edgier sound is sexier than ever and very danceable. \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\" is pure Nsync (written by boyfriend Justin Timberlake and choreographer Wade Robson) and proves Britney is ready to take pop to the next step. <BR>`Britney' will be a massive multi-platinum hit all over the world - that's for sure. And it's not even undeserved this time. I'm quite intruiged of how long this girl will last in the spotlight (she's often reffered to as the new Madonna)but rather than looking to the future, let's all enjoy the tunes Britney has to offer today...
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is excellent, period.  When i got this cd, I instantly fell in love with it and it's still one of my favorite albums.  Kurt Cobain's lyrics are amazing, his guitar compliments the lyrics and his mood very well, and Krist's bass and Dave's drums provide a great sound that makes the songs enjoyable every time you listen to them.  Nevermind was and is a milestone in the Grunge era, not to mention that it paved the way for many bands today.  Nevermind has a nice, polished sound that you don't get with In Utero, Bleach, or Incesticide, and maybe that's why it appeals to more people...  One of the best albums of the nineties, and of all time.  Everyone that listens to rock, alternative, grunge, metal, or even punk should have Nevermind.  It's a truly great album, from Smells Like Teen Spirit to Something In The Way.  What are you waiting for!?  Get it now!
B00000J6AG|5.0|I bought this CD in the Summer of 1999 because I was a fan of Moby's previous works.  I loved his self-titled album and Everything Is Wrong, and was expecting more of the same.  I was taken aback.  Moby seems to have gone from underground techno artist, with us since the beginning, to top artist in the genre, or maybe up there with Fatboy Slim.  <BR>Fast-forward to Summer 2001: MTV discovered it, and when they put Gwen Stefani in the video and had her butcher the chorus to South Side, it became a hit.  Fortunately, the album does not include any celebrity guest appearances, and instead focuses on the music's soul, rather than it's look.  <BR>This album not only appeals to those unfamiliar with Moby with Run On, Porcelain, Honey, Natural Blues, and of course South Side, he shows his listeners that he's not afraid to pull out the old styles out of the bag as well.  Most of the first 11 songs are fantastic, but after Run On, he steps back a little bit and gives us a few tracks reminiscent of his Ambient CD.  A few tracks slow you down a bit, and by the time you've mellowed out a little bit, he drops Everloving on you.  That song evokes an emotional response in me.  If you don't own this album, buy it.  If you like the South Side remix that's on MTV, you're in for a treat.  The real album is a thousand times better.<BR>PS: get some good speakers, or better yet some good headphones, cut out the background noise, and devote an hour and three minutes to getting to know this CD.  It doesn't disappoint.

0871137380|5.0|Awesome story.  Bowdens writing of the story put me right there in the action. I thought about it for days after reading the book.  One of the few books that I've read nearly straight through and couldn't put down. It gave me a new appreciation of our military. Everyone should read this book.
B00000DHZJ|2.0|Can somebody tell me what all the hooplah is surrounding this Jimi Hendrix character?  I bought this album after my first ever guitar lesson, in which my teacher told me his music would be simple for a completely clueless beginner like myself to start playing.  I can still remember getting home, putting the record on, having no clue what to expect, only to be let down by the simplicity of the music that emenated from the speakers.  &quot;Purple Haze,&quot; the first song on the album, while having a fun, danceable beat, has a guitar riff that suspiciously reminds me of a Rick Springfield song.  Hmm...I wonder who mr. Hendrix got his ideas from.  &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; was another let down.  The scorching guitar that marked Bob Dylan's original version of the song is completely absent from this one. &quot;Hey Joe&quot; is a diamond in the rough, sporting some meaningful, insightful lyrics.  Other than that, I was disappointed by this album.  My guitar teacher was right--Hendrix is an easy guitarist to start out playing, but I know I NEVER want to sound like him.  For any guitar lovers out there, Blink 182 and Green Day are much better examples of sheer virtuosity.
0789723107|5.0|..there's not much more to say but I will anyhow.<br />My confidence in my web design abilites have increased two fold. Not only can I now look at my own sites more objectively I can look at other sites too and learn more than I ever have before. While I was reading the book I was designing layouts for a web site and I went from no homepage to a clear, concise, no-nonsense homepage that truly serves a functional and good looking purpose.<br />I will reference this book for a very long time, probably until I have memorized it! I highly recommend this book for anyone involved in any aspect of web design, from the web designer to the CEO. Great find, must have!
6304806434|3.0|I purchased this movie two months ago expecting it to detail a new hair dryer model from the popular maker of hair manipualtion appliances.  What I actually recieved was an utter disappointement.  It has nothing to do with hair dryers, but rather tells the story of a group of CONvicts who overtake an AIRplane transferring them to another prison--hence the misleading name of the movie.  While I must admit that the movie was filled with suspense, and was actually quite enjoyable--Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor--it was nothing I would have knowingly purchased.  So beware--If you are expecting a DVD about hairdryers, do not buy this.  However, if you are looking for an action-packed thriller, this is for you.

B00005QG9J|5.0|&quot;Incubus is selling out! oh no what will we do&quot;.  try shuting up!!  Here is what you do:  Listen to the CD, If you like it, great. if you don't, that is great too, it doesn't matter, just don't listen to the cd. don't tell people is not like them because nobody knows what incubus is all about, only they do.  &quot;i am scared it will be beat to death by the radio&quot; IT DOESN&quot;T MATTER. I don't care because i don't listen to the radio.  I have all of incubus's cd's  and think everyone of them is awesome.       morning view is nothing like make yourself, it set apart in it's own way.  It sounds to me more like a mellowed out s.c.i.e.n.c.e. with out the funk, which i do miss.  If they wrote it when they  was stoned, then this was written when they was coming down, but still great incubus.
B000002BBY|5.0|While Definitely Maybe is the best debut of all time ,with its swaggering riffs and lyrics. This follow up still has that swagger and arrogance but with a bit of polish and maturity. 'Hello' must be one of the best opening tracks of an album and sets the mood brilliantly. The rest album is arranged cohesively and smoothly with every song feeling as if it could not be placed any better anywhere else on the album. There are singalong anthems in 'Wonderwall' and 'Don't Look Back in Anger', rock and roll classics in 'Roll with It' and 'Some Might Say' and the epic, most perfect ending to an album: 'Champagne Supernova'. Quite pssibly Liam's best vocals and some of Noels most inspired songwriting it makes want to laugh, cry, jump for joy and most of all praise the lord that these five loud-mouth lads from Manchester were born!
0792844793|4.0|This is simply the best movie David Lynch has ever directed, and Laura Dern, Kyle Mac Lachlan, Dennis Hopper and Isabella Rosellini (Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rosellini's daughter) play their parts as good as one can presume they were able to.

B00005O5CM|4.0|LEGALLY BLONDE may seem like your typical &quot;air head&quot; movie at first but there's way more too it. Reese Witherspoon is excellent as Elle in this film. She plays the part very well. Basically LEGALLY BLONDE is about this girl whom everyone thinks is your &quot;typical blonde girl&quot; so they don't give her enough credit. Elle (Reese Witherspoon) is determained to proove that she's got what it takes to make it as a lawyer. That's basically how it goes in a nutshell. There are some surprises and it's filled with humor. LEGALLY BLONDE is filled with fun, lots of laughs, and a great storyline. The acting is also well done. Great movie!

B00005QHPQ|5.0|Enrique returns with his sophmore effort ESCAPE. After a 2 year break and the muli-platinum sucess of his english debut album ENRIQUE, he kicks it up a notch. This album is awesome. It's upbeat, dancy vibe draws you in with one listen. ESCAPE is dance/pop bliss with touches of electronica. On the lyrics side of things, Enrique presents himself as the shy, submissive, and sometimes dominant singer that he is. On ESCAPE he likes lusty women that take control on songs like &quot;one night stand&quot;, &quot;she be the one.&quot; The slight S&amp;M themed &quot;love to see you cry&quot; in which he states, &quot;I don't know why/but I love to see you cry&quot; and &quot;the sweetest pleasure is pain&quot;. In &quot;escape&quot; he chants &quot;you can run/you can hide/but you can't escape my love.&quot; Besides all of that playfulness, ESCAPE offers some tender moments as well. Tracks like the hit &quot;hero&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; are beautifully done. Enrique has an intimate, sometimes off-key voice through out ESCAPE. His vocals are strong and clear and his accent adds sort of an akward, destinct quality to each track. ESCAPE is pure fun.
B000006U44|5.0|Kate Bush was one of the first to teach us that pop music doesn't have to be shallow and that girl singers don't have to be airheads.  Some of these songs actually require you to read a book before you understand the lyrics.<BR>I discovered her music about three years ago (I was born in 1978 so I was too young to remember her in her heyday)when a friend lent me the C.D.  A huge fan of Emily Bronte, I was just blown away by Wuthering Heights, I felt like the spirit of Emily was speaking through her.  It's so amazing that an 18 year old could compose a song full of such raw emotion and intellectual depth.  <BR>Every song on the album has a warmth to it, a charm that is both old-world and distinctly ahead of it's time.  How lucky for us that, unlike most of the genius population, Kate Bush didn't have to struggle for years in anonimity, but that her songs were given to the world straight away.<BR>I'll never be one of the people who critisize Tori Amos and other singers inspired by Kate because WE NEED MORE OF THEM.

0451204530|1.0|Hard to believe that this book is by the same author that wrote &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; and &quot;Night Over Water&quot;.  Good premise that never, ever, gets off the launch pad for the entire book.  Historical inaccuracies abound, i.e., Xerox photocopying in 1958, sloppy editing, i.e., in one scene Elspeth is driving a white '57 Chevy Bel Air convertible, in the next scene its a white Corvette and in the next scene the '57 Bel Air is back, and Mr. Follet assumes that the reader has no short or long term memory, i.e., he tells over and over why a character is loyal to another character.  Poorly developed plot, no real character development and the way that events fall together are pretty incredible.  James Lee Burke and Martin Cruz Smith are better at writing this kind of story.
0789723107|5.0|This book does not come up with new wow! kind of concepts that you won't find in some guise somewhere, BUT it is written in an exceptionally readable and understandable manner.  The author manages to drive his poiunt across by choosing really good examples.  <br />The examples, for me, is what distinguishes this book from others.  The author chooses, in most cases, reasonably well-designed web sites and critisize them using his &quot;laws&quot;.  And lets face it, it is easy to critisize a really bad example, but critizing a good one is much more difficult.  <br />Also quit appropriate is that no claims is made (in fact it is disclaimed in the first chapter) that there exist a &quot;perfect way&quot;.  The author however drives the message home that designers should think - so that users don't have to think.  In essense the author merely provides a framework that can be used to structure your thoughts.<br />If you want to design web sites you MUST READ this book, regardless of what you know or not about user interaction.  The book is written with exceptional clarity.  I also like the word play in the title - readers of this book will in fact do a lot of thinking - so that they don't make their users think...
B00005ATQD|5.0|Eyes wide shut is by far Stanley Kubrick's best film this film blows you away for the whole 2 1/2 hours. Its photographed extremely well the acting is brillent and the direction is simple amazing. The DVD is not bad either I just wish they had a unrated version for you can see the way Kubrick's hunting orgy sequence was suppose to look. But who knows when thats going to happen this film is just Kubrick at his best.
6305176299|5.0|The name says it all, this is an intense film from start to finish, it never lets up!, it begins with a scene in a high-rise where people are leaving work for the day, as they get on the elevator, they become targets of a mad bomber who motivation is to extort money, Dennis Hopper is at his best as the mad bomber, Keanu Reeves is a swat team member called in to stop Hopper, which he does, but just barely, he is soon given a medal for his heroic display, but his celebration is short-lived as Hopper who is still a bit ticked off about his plan gone wrong decides to taunt Reeves &amp; graciously puts his skills to the test, a bus soon explodes as a way to get Reeves' attention, soon Hopper is taunting Reeves about his next plan to blow up another bus that Reeves can stop if he pursues it, Reeves soon finds it only to discover that it has passed 50 miles per hour(if it drops it explodes)he now has to keep it above, how he boards the bus is a sight to see. Sandra Bullock is a passenger who unwillingly has to take the wheel when the driver is shot by another passenger who thinks Reeves is on to get him, he is soon disarmed &amp; the action begins, Police &amp; News helicopters are soon above &amp; Hopper watches with joy on T.V. Reeves &amp; his fellow officers make several attempts to disarm the bomb, but fail, Hopper realizes this &amp; creates a diversion to lure Reeves' partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) to a location to kill him &amp; many other cops, then he taunts Reeves some more, Hopper is definately his nastiess here &amp; he does not ever flinch hardly, eventually Reeves creates a diversion of his own a fools Hopper, but before he can breathe a sigh of relief Bullock is kidnapped by Hopper who is wearing a police uniform that implies that he used to be cop that was let go because of a mishap,which explaines his resentment toward cops, him &amp; Reeves eventually fight atop a commuter train that Hopper has hijacked, he is killed &amp; Reeves now has to get Bullock whowas handcuffed to a steal beam off, Reeves &amp; Bullock have unique chemistry that works well here, A great film from start to finish!!!!

B00000G3PA|4.0|Why do people hate this movie?, I for one like it, at first I wasn't sure I would, I mean Bruce Willis had a series of flops before this, &amp; after seeing &quot;Deep Impact&quot; months before, how could it top that. Well this one is much better, it may have a series of characters that many could care less about, but they are real people that many of us could or do identify with, The film starts off with a NASA shuttle doing routine satellite repair, only to be destroyed by an incoming debree of asteriods, Billy Bob Thorton gives the best performance as the NASA director who now has the weight of the worlds fate on his shoulders &amp; must find a solution &amp; fast!!, they discover that an asteriod is headed to earth &amp; that the end of mankind is upon them, the only real solution is to land a team on it &amp; drop a nuclear reactor inside in the hopes of destroying its projectory, they hire Bruce Willis &amp; his team to do the job since it requires drilling, somthing these guys are professionals at doing, they undergo rigorous training &amp; are carried into space to complete the mission, one could argue that NASA would never do such a thing, but how do we know?? we have never been faced with such circumstances,&amp; we have to believe that NASA would do whatever it would take to save the world, this is a well put together film, one of Willis' better movies, Thornton really shines here as does Willis who appears much more serious than his previous roles, Willis' character is as beleiveable here, his best role since the original &quot;Die Hard&quot;. the film leaves the viewer with so much emotion at the end, that you feel like you were there also &amp; that you care about these people whereas in the beginning you might not. not to say that &quot;Deep Impact&quot; is bad, but I personally can't see how we could sit still &amp; wait to die, &quot;Armageddon&quot; refuses to take that approach!!, Is it possible to do what is done in &quot;Armageddon&quot;? who knows but I would rather fight till the end than wait to die. A great film for those wanting action as well as emotion.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|this review is based on the movie. my choice for best movie of the year, definitely best script and editing. the presentation fits the subject. with few characters and scenes the movie is intense as it races time. please notice the black and white vs. color scenes, why? a must see again, thus the DVD. a keeper and possibly an important movie from a film standpoint. for the serious ones out there.
B000002513|5.0|A moment before the phenomenal success of \\"Born To Run\\"(BTR) , came \\"The Young The Innocent and the E-Street Shuffle\\", several months after his advent with \\"Greetings From Asbury Park NJ \\" . The latter two albums together are considered and heard as something young, fresh, new and full of happiness . Springsteen, at the dawn of his career, sounds enthusiastic and thrilled to get started and try to reach nationwide distribution and recognition .<br />As with all his later albums, it seems like he invested every inch of talent at his disposal to achieve his very best , and did he achieve it , pale ! I have to emphasize that what I'm saying here stands for both albums, since they are much alike in sound , atmosphere and the feeling they generate in me. Listening to them you don't have to wonder why Bruce was considered from the very start as the \\"New Dylan\\" , and as a big promise on his own . Almost every song in these albums is special and remarkable, and as with his later works, some songs are rhythmic and represent the `Rock and Roll' side, and the others are unique ballads only a few others can compete with .<br />Now, as mentioned, \\"Born To Run\\" brought the major success and the big bucks . From that point on the man has grown up , a fact that made his songs more and more serious and even somber now and then, a fact that was distinct in \\"Darkness On the Edge Of Town\\" after the quarrel he'd had with the record company. \\"The River\\" was also not an entirely jolly album , just listening the song \\"The River\\" confirms . In \\"Born In The U.S.A\\" he protested against the government , while in \\"Tunnel Of Love\\" he mourned his ruined marriage , and so forth . My point is - you're left with these two (maybe Three, including \\"BTR\\") albums as a witness of a worries free, innocent , happy and youthful Springsteen . More precisely, only the two first ones embody the maiden style, before the transformation he has gone through in \\"BTR\\" to the Springsteen we know to date, a fact that make them even more desirable .<br />Switching solely to \\"The Young, The Innocent And The E - Street Shuffle\\" , if you're a serious fan you can't let this one go by : all the above is revealed from the very first song --- \\"The E - Street Shuffle\\"--- What a song ! All the excitement of a young man from the life he's discovering is wrapped up in this song . You actually hear and feel Springsteen's will to devour the world and everything it offers in the composition and in each and every word written . Then, you cannot fall in love, on first listen, with the beautiful `Sandy' a delicate longing song, probably for his former girlfriend . Bruce sings like he's telling a story in some parts , and in other parts he sings almost in the pace of talking, a twist that adds a lot to the impact of the song . Long after I'd heard it(fot the first time !) I couldn't stop humming the chorus `Hey Sandy girl, my, my, my, my ,my baby ...\\".<br /><br />The next song I wish to discuss is \\"Incident on 57th street&quot; . This is so relaxing creation - just hearing the line \\"Good night it's alright baby...\\" produces a pleasant feeling of peace and tranquility I can't stay indifferent to . And if I dare dozing off, the Boss returns to the funky rhythm and wakes me up with the fervent \\"Rosalita\\" that really rocks . Lastly, we're introduced to the grandest epic in this album - \\"New York City Serenade\\" - a poem that delivers everything its name implies ; This is the longest song in the album (up to 10 minutes), consisting a few musical genres that integrate wonderfully in one another , making it a fitting closure to a great album .<br />I can sum it all up by saying that the 5 stars consensus here in Amazon says it all -  no way are you going to be dissatisfied with this terrific album !make them even more desirable .<br />Switching solely to \\"The Young, The Innocent And The E - Street Shuffle\\" , if you're a serious fan you can't let this one go by : all the above is revealed from the very first song --- \\"The E - Street Shuffle\\"--- What a song !

6305095566|5.0|I own this movie and I watch it quite often and you should own it to.Why?Its great!If you love horror you will love this.Not only the first in the Evil Dead series but the best.It did not have the comic trappings of the others.It did have a little humour but it was in many ways really good scares and gore done in a very creative way all on a very low budget.Its amazing they made something this good so cheap.Okay we all know Bruce Campbell(Ash)goes to stay at some cabin in the woods with some friends,his girlfriend,and his sister.They find the Necronomicon(for all you Lovecraft fans.)they then read from it which we all know is not the best ideal.Soon things are happening,scary and threatening things.The thing that makes it scary is that the woods in and of themselves are truly the land of the wild and are living with evil.One of the girls goes for a walk and some trees rape her.Okay that sounds terrible and shocking but its done pretty tastefully,well as tasteful as you can make a tree raping someone scene.It was definitely original.Soon everyone is freaking out and scared.Two of the girls are sitting down trying to see if they have any psychic abillities by guessing what card the other is holding up.A third girl is staring out the window.Soon she begins naming all the cards being held up at a fast rate,something is definitely not right going on here!Then her voice changes she turns around,her eyes are rolled back hands in claws,fangs!It is a truly scary moment the first time you watch it.Yes she is possessed by one of the elder beings from beyond time.I cant give alot away and ruin it for all of you who have never seen this but suffice to say never a dull moment from here lots of gore and lots of unique and unheard of stuff done with that gore.Yes I love Evil Dead and if you appreciate good horror you will to.
B00005N9CV|1.0|I hate to give this CD such a low rating because I like the music (not her best but I would have rated it 4 stars).  Unfortunately, this CD appears to be &quot;protected&quot; by one of those new copy protection schemes that adds noise to the CD.<br />On my 3 cd players I could hear a clicking sound every 10-15 seconds.  It's barely audible, but now that I've heard it I always hear it.  More frustrating, however, 3 of 5 computer CDROM drives I tried won't even read the disc.<br />I hope that Universal stops this insane practice.  It completely destroys my enjoyment of the music.
0448060191|5.0|Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott.  This is a marvelous story.  It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor.  Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses.  She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women.  During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader. <BR> Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech.  Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story.  She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens.  In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie.  When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room.  She really means how marvelous and great the room was.  People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does. <BR> Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing.  She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie.  Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John.  Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him.  Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that.  So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town.  All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave.  You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\"  With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does.  Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of.  Jo was of course devastated with the death and lostof poor Beth.  Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her.  They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo.  As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing.  She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her.  She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing.  With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.  <BR> Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character.  For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story.  At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published.  Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character.  At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down.  Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy.  Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before.  Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John.  Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous.  She does nothing but try to please others.  She adores music and plays the piano very well.  She seems like a real person that some one would know from school.  These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these. <BR> Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book.  No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it.  It is a book for all ages.  Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people.  Readers can relate to the events in the story and canrelate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many.  Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell.  Now that is fantastic novel.
B000000H57|5.0|I just got into ToN since June of 2001, when i bought World Coming Down, Recently i received Bloody Kisses (Digipack), today i received October Rust and I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THIS ALBUM!! This album is so great it has sounds of Sadness, Love, abd Great Dispair. My fav tracks include, Love You To Death, Red Waters (Christmas Mourning), Burnt Flowes Fallen, and In Haunted!!!
B00005QJDG|5.0|Scenes from a Memory (all of disk 1 and tracks 1-3 of disk 2):  this sounds even better live than in the studio!  For one, Jordan's keyboards are more at the forefront, and his playing seems even faster and more furious than before.  His ragtime piano solo on 'Dance of Eternity' is just amazing, and his extension of the 'One Last Time' intro is a nice touch.  James LaBrie has vastly improved since 'Once in a Livetime' and his vocals are really powerful.  John Myung, although content to stay mainly in the background, doesn't miss a beat and his spider-finger bass is amazing.  Portnoy, although I will agree is sometimes a little self-indulgent on drums, really contributes here, ESPECIALLY in the outro to 'Finally Free' where he just goes off, and it is just such a cool ending to SFAM.  And that leaves Mr. Petrucci, performing one of the most moving pieces of music in his solo spot with Theresa Thompson.  It left me speechless.  I wasn't a big fan of the hypnotherapist (the band even makes fun of him on the DVD), but overall an awesome play of SFAM with a little extra riff at the end.<br />Metropolis Part I(disk 2, tr 4):  I love this song as much as anyone, but it sounds basically the same as always and its what you would expect.<br />The Mirror (disk 2, tr 5):  Very cool with an extended ending-Myung's bass spot near the end of the song sends chills up my spine.<br />Just Let Me Breathe (disk 2, tr 6):  This is probably my least favorite of the entire set.  I was never a big fan of most FII songs.<br />Acid Rain (disk 2, tr 7):  Awesome to hear one of my favorite songs from LTE2!!!  I would like to have heard it in its entirety, but they played the cool parts at the beginning, so I will NOT complain-awesome choice.<br />Caught in a New Millenium (disk 2, tr 8):  Cool combination of these songs results in a nice twist in the album.  I was duly impressed.<br />Another Day (disk 2, tr 9):  Its been awhile since I've heard this, so it was a nice surprise, and Beckensteinon sax is really good and the fans singing along is a nice touch.  Not my favorite from IaW, but cool nonetheless.<br />Jordan's Key Solo (disk 2, tr 10):  The highlight of Disk 2!!  Some classically influenced soloing followed by some synth virtuosity and shows why Jordan is probably now the best keyman in the world.  Keyboard wizard, i think not, more like keyboard monster!<br />A Mind Beside Itself (disk 3, tr 1-3):  Very cool, the live version of Silent Man is above and beyond anything I'd expected.  'Voices' sounds much better here than on OiaL becomes James's voice is way better and he hits the all-important vocals with a purpose.<br />Learning to Live (disk 3, tr 4):  I like this song, but I could have 'learned to live' without it, nothing new here except for a short Rudess reggae spot near the end which is a nice switch of pace.<br />A Change of Seasons (disk 3, tr 5):  This is way better here than the studio album!  And what other band on the planet could fit 'the Simpsons''s theme in the middle of a 23+ minute song?  I also am glad they played the whole thing together instead of segmented like on OiaL.  <br />I do not mean to sound critical, but I would have loved to have heard some rarities in place of Learning to Live, Erotomania, Just Let Me Breathe, and (sorry DT fans) Metropolis I, maybe something off their first album (i would love to hear Rudess's interpretation of the YTSE Jam!).  I also noticed they strayed away from any songs written by Kevin Moore, which is a shame because I miss &quot;Wait for Sleep&quot;, &quot;Surrounded&quot;, and &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;.  Nonetheless this is such an awesome album I can't help but give it 5 stars.  I would definetely recommend this to almost anyone for musical quality, and recommend the DVD for those who wish to see the magic happen.  I don't like to credit just one guy, but it does seem that Jordan Rudess has sparked new life in this band that has been lacking and the rest of the band brings up their level of playing.  I give tons of credit to James LaBrie for sounding really inspired-his voice HAS improved a great deal in the past few years.  Kudos, DT, on an awe-inspiring release!
B00003CWTI|1.0|All I can say is that this movie really was trite and very boring. It was tring really hard to be something that it wasn't. It felt like someone was despertly tring to tell me, &quot;look I can be creative.&quot; There wasn't anything ground breaking. Way overhyped.
0451160916|5.0|I love this book, there, quick and to the point.  I really love this book, the story, the characters, the setting, everything.  The first time I read it, I was engrossed from the first word.  The slow descent into madness, the way the house was affecting Jack, the ghosts, or were they ghosts?  Everything about the story is great.  I've read it eight times now, each time as good as the last.  I've watched the film and the made-for-TV movie, the first movie is good, the new one is okay, but the book is the best.  Great detail, characters that seem real and a story that keeps you going to the very last word, and then maybe rereading it all over again, just in case you missed anything.  If you're new to horror, then this is the book to start with, if you've read it before, read it again.  But you could never be a reader if you miss this book out, it really is a classic.
014028902X|5.0|I am so excited that this book is back in print!  I first read it as a class assignment in 7th grade (almost 20 years ago) and still have that copy, dog-eared and falling apart.  I have probably read it 100 times since then, no exaggeration.  It is the one book I can always count on to pick me up when I am down.  I am so glad that they are publishing this book again so a whole new generation of lovers of animals and quirky families can enjoy the escapades of the Durrell family.  You will laugh yourself silly!
B00005R23S|5.0|I guess I'm the only person in Germany who owns that DVD yet.<BR>Here it is not out yet and I paid $ 55 just for postage to get it here as soon as possbile. Now you call me nuts? I know. That's a lot of money for a poor student but I would spend my last penny for Bruce! He is the best artist ever! Nobody performs like he does!<BR>I received the DVD one day after the release in the USA and since then I watched it three times!! I have already seen the HBO broadcast but the picture and sound quality on the DVD is amazing and can't be compared to TV!<BR>If you do not own a 5.1 system it is NOW the time to pick up one! And to get the best picture go and buy a widescreen TV! With this equipment it feels nearly like being at a Bruce concert. But still the DVD does not come close to a real live experience with Bruce. But you know what I'm talking about if you have been to a Bruce show. But the DVD does best to capture a bit of the atmosphere. Go and buy it. Watch it again and again. And watch it LOUD!
B000002GGO|5.0|I was 16 when I bought this, and took it to my San Fernando valley job which was cooking fried chicken at a restaurant with other teens like me.  We could play whatever music we wanted.  This tape was played over and over again.  There is something about this album which completely captures the 80's like very, very few albums do.  Every track is strong.  Simple Minds never came close to duplicating this effort.  I would rank it next to U2's War and the Police Zenyata Mondata as for comprehensive strength with no fillers, as well as very similiar sounding, via the era. there are some real chestnuts out there from the early 80s and this is definately a shame if it as overlooked as I suspect.  It definately bolstered Kroq radio in the 83/84 span.  I just listened to all of the samples for the 1st time in a long while, and smiled cause the songs hold up.  Great voice, drums, and energy from a band that truly peaked, if only for a moment.
B00005LMBK|4.0|It's actually quite amazing that this album became so popular, despite the comic strip image the Gorillaz have given themselves. The music is not poppy at all and actually neatly evades mainstream pop and rock idioms. Some people may find it hard to relate to the less catchy tracks on this album. People 'in the know' though would recognize a lot of the musical elements being used. First and for all there are Automator's trademark sparse hip-hop beats. No, there are generally NO drum computers involved, but carefully perpared drum loops, which give a lot of the tracks their deep, slow moving character. The Gorillaz also took a lot of inspiration from Dub music. They even used melodica lines very reminiscent of Augustus Pablo's innovative work in the Dub field (you hear a lot of melodica in &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot; and &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;).<br />One minor point is Albarn's singing, which at times sounds very uninspired and dull. This doesn't really contribute to the often already slow tunes, making them sound more boring than they actually are. One star off because of that...
1577311523|5.0|It is very rare to find a book that enables you to actually experience the level of consciousness that the author is trying to convey. This book is not for your head. It speaks to your soul.
B00003CXFV|2.0|There's nothing new from Julia Roberts in this movie. I have no idea what sort of woman the real Erin Brockovich was from Roberts' portrayal. This is just another movie in which Roberts turns her character into a form of herself. The only things I know about Brockovich from this movie, if it can be trusted for giving a correct portrayal of the woman, is that she is extremely brash and vulgar. I also highly doubt that the people that were actually surrounding this woman were as bland as they were made out to be.<br />When the movie finally comes around to the storyline about the contamination, everything smooths out a bit, and it becomes easier to overlook the sloppy characterization of just about everyone in this film. The only bits of description for the smaller characters were added to make the crude Brockovich look like a saint. If the real world were as full as such terrible people as in this movie, there would be no hope for civilization to last more than a few more years. And if Brockovich, as she is portrayed in the movie, were our salvation, like in the movie, we would be doomed.<br />As a writer, it always pains me to see a movie that could have been good completely wasted because of the screenplay. There's no excuse for secondary characters to be written as cardboard, or maybe that feeling only comes out in Julia Roberts films. And truthfully, her acting was just as dull as it normally is.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Every band has a greatest hits album of some sort(The Doors have about 3), so there was no question this album would come eventually.  But every true Floyd fan knows that Floyd is not a singles band. This is good for the newcomer, someone interested in Pink Floyd but not familiar with it. However, nothing from More, such as Cymbaline or Main Theme, nothing from Obscured by Clouds, such as Free Four or Childhoods End, and no Brain Damage, Eclipse, Mother, Run Like Hell, Carefull with that Axe,Eugene, etc.etc.etc.  Nevertheless, with the segue ways and so forth, it is still an excellent buy. I just hope that people don't limit themselves to this, when there is much more to Pink Floyd then one double CD.
B00005N9CV|4.0|The Look of Love is one of Diana's best. I have pondered why I am so attracted to Diana's performances, and I have realized that she presents musical content more than she presents herself, a rarity among performers. It is a selfless gift. I wondered why her first CD was rated so highly since I think it not one of her best efforts, but, then it was her first and had no comparison. Her style has refined itself so much with each CD. I'm also impressed with the photographs on each CD, so elegantly is she attired and photographed. Can the shoes on The Look of Love be Prada? I confess that I have a major crush on this woman!
0783240287|1.0|I saw this show on broadway as a child. I loved it. I listened to the original broadway cast album over and over and loved it. The songs were charming and smart, the message was honest and true, and the narrator was sung by one of the finest voices ever to grace the American stage. On the stage, the sets were minimalist and simple and supported the cast and story rather than overpowering or outshining them.<br />This video production of the show sadly misses the spirit of the show and just doesn't have the best people singing it.<br />This show was originally created to be preformed by students in schools. It was a low budget production that showed off talent and concepts, and splashy production wasn't required or desired. This video version is all splashy production, with very little substance or soul. It's glitzy and glittery and you end up thinking about how pretty it looks rather than feeling involved in the story or the music.<br />Maria Friedman does a competent job as the narrator, although the role was written for a man and was, I believe, only changed for the female voice for performance by the immortal Laurie Beechman, who is sadly no longer with us. Maria is likeable enough, she'll do. Perhaps if I hadn't heard the role sung by the best, I wouldn't be so critical of her in comparison. Donny Osmond does a good job *acting* the role of Joseph, but doesn't sing it as well as the gentleman who I remember on Broadway. The rest of the cast is, well, *there*. I've seen the DVD twice and I can barely recall any of their faces, so I suppose they could be referred to as *forgettable*.<br />I do have to admit I was amused by Joan Collins's cameo. As she sings all of one sentence, her voice is not at issue.<br />I also particularly disliked that they've moved the song &quot;any dream will do&quot; to the beginning of the show. It was written for the end of the show, and doesn't make any sense at the beginning. It's out of context, and also I believe it was intended as an expression of angst and confusion and loss, and yet it's played as a cheerful happy song, which *really* doesn't make sense to me.<br />This production makes me feel like Andrew Lloyd Webber has forgotten what the show is about.<br />If there was any other version of this show available on video, I would not have bought this one.

B000050XEI|3.0|I like Enya a lot but I think this is one of her poorer albums. It just didn't give me the chills that some of her outher albums do.
B000002H70|5.0|This is the one.  This is THE Cure album.  Everything about its sound both whispers and screams &quot;Cure&quot; in the same breath.  Enough of that though.  Seriously this is Robert Smith (and his band's) crowning achievement.  It is the best music to listen to on a rainy day that I have ever heard.  It comes off as both extremely powerful and effortless at the same time.  The arrangements and production are unparalelled.<BR>     Let it be said that I don't award five stars to just any album.  I am admittedly a huge Cure fan.  Even though I love most of their work, this and &quot;Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; are the only albums truely deserving of five star ratings, and for completely different reasons.  While &quot;Kiss Me...&quot; is all over the place with a bunch of Cure signature styles and contains my favorite single of theirs, &quot;Just Like Heaven,&quot; &quot;Disintegration&quot; is a proper album with a singular theme.  This is not a detraction, but allows the album stand out as one amazing mood piece that has only gotten better with age.  Its scope is epic, and its emotion is pure.  It sounds both soft and harsh, with  its colors gliding on a blue/grey scale, all the while somehow remaining comforting.<BR>     This album is the Cure at the height of their expressive/depressive powers.  Even the hit single &quot;Lovesong&quot; remains beautifully melancholy.  One song listened to alone here does not do the album justice.  It is only through beginning to end play that the emotional scope is attainable for the listener.  I think of &quot;Disintegration&quot; as a single song with many movements.  Listing standout cuts is really difficult with this one as it really stands out best only when complete.  The guitar work, wind chimes, synth sounds, bass lines, complex percussion are all first rate.<BR>     Summation:  If you are a Cure fan;  If you are appreciative of truely original and epic alternative/rock/pop (other labels too) music;  If you love to listen to brooding lyrical and instrumental mosaics while or while not feeling sullen; this music is a gift to all of you.  It is truely one of the great musical acheivements of the last 20 years.

And John Leguizamo does a great Toulouse Latrec. The only thing I didn't like was the use of Whitney Houston's &quot;I will always love you&quot; and Madonna's &quot;Like a virgin&quot;. Other than that, a great movie that I will definitely see again...
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney does it once again.  This CD is fantastic.  Just do yourself a favor and buy it.
078401213X|5.0|This movie is powerfully and beautifully subversive. It doesn't just simply tackle the world of INNER space, merging the psychological with the scientific and mystical like its fraternal/spiritual twin THE MATRIX.  Nor does it heavyhandedly demand you to make the kind of simple choices that are really nothing more than candy for a mind aching for the nutrients of provocative challenging thought or even, secretly, spiritual crises.  (Questions that ignore the relevance of the movie's theme, like &quot;is Max [the main character] really crazy or just a genius? or both?&quot;, the way the new Kevin Spacey vehicle K-PAX engenders [is he an E.T., or just a psychotic? Or both?&quot;].  After a while that becomes like &quot;do you think the people in this porno movie are falling in love, or no?&quot;).<br />This movie is powerfully, joyously, triumphantly unsettling and subversive, becuase it reveals the emperor that has no clothes in many of the philosphical questions we ask routinely of ourselves.  We ask these powerful questions at parties and during some international crisis, but with a manufactured profundity to hide the degree to which we have exorcised pondering their actual implications from our everyday intellectual and emotional lives.  Is there really a God?  What is sanity, really?  What is the relevance of religion in a post-Einstein/Freudian/Tech stock/Prozac world? What can ancient history teach us about the modern present...  We don't really care to have a legitimate answer to these questions because they are now designed to have us continue sleeping before they are even asked, whether outright or cryptically; not to really wake us up.  But logical, simple yet scientific questions about the innate structure of reality...the possible high order that defines it and the universe, above and beyond illusion of randomness, duality and chaos...the implications of a world that is really all just levels of energy and their unifying, &quot;harmonic&quot; relationships to human consciousness and being--right down to how we define and express the very concepts (like love, happiness, freedom, enlightenment, reality and yes,  GOD) that form the basis of our everyday lives... These kind of questions still frighten us, because you can't ask them without receiving some information that will shock your world, whether the complete answer agrees with your preconceptions, doesn't, or never fully comes.  We can argue the existence of God, but what can we say about the existence of the golden ratio, the Fibonacci Series, or Pi?  And what do we do if it IS in the Bible and Torah and the architecture of the Pyramids as much as it is in nature?<br />The movie PI takes this fundamental theme/question of our modern world--*do you have the courage to question your existence, before it questions you?*--and riffs on it like Charlie Parker on the chords of the blues.  &quot;Forget the characters and their lives; I'll make them interesting only because bad character development would distract you even more&quot; Aranofsky (the writer and director) seems to say to us. &quot;Let's talk about order vs. chaos, and the proof of both that helps declare the other an illusion.  Knowing that, perhaps, only one gives the illusion of the other the relevance and respect that it deserves: making IT the real *reality* by definition.  And then let's deal with the implications of believeing in the supremacy or existence of either--or both--to the human mind, and the human heart, considering how virutally anything else we talk about in life is a metaphor for one or the other anyway.<br />PI is the kind of movie that doesn't just make philosophy fun (removing it from the spoiling hands of many a philosopher). It makes it relevant.  The acting is done very well; the filming effect of gritty, harsh, and stark black and white color is very effective.  And it is very, very weird.  It gets into the mind of a man who is erasing that fine, ever-erased line spearating geniusfrom insanity as enlightenment approaches.  This is an important film, however, because of how deeply it moves you.  It can even change your way of thinking by bringing up what it does.<br />If you can name your favorite Twilight Zone rerun in less than five seconds, this movie will become an imporant part of your discography.  I put it on par with THE MATRIX as one of the most important science myth films (as opposed to science fiction films) to be made this past decade.

B00005ABX0|4.0|We get more of an after-taste of the \\"Smile\\" album with \\"Smiley Smile.\\" It isn't the album, but more like a peep-hole view or just the after scent of \\"Smile.\\" You have to reverse-engineer things to get the feel of \\"Smile.\\" \\"With Me Tonight\\" has Carl's sweet voice, hinting at his emerging centrality in the band. He shouldered much of the weight of the band in the '70's.<br />\\"Wild Honey\\" is the Beach Boys equivalent of the \\"White Album,\\" except that the Beach Boys do a better job of rough rhythm and blues than the cranked up Beatles do. You have the heart-pounding roughness of the Beatles but still you ears are anointed with eh wild honey sweetness of the Beach Boys musicality. And that is the strength of the album--power and control.<br />The cover art is worthy of notice. The calm greens of \\"Smiley Smile\\" underwhelm the acid-red \\"Sgt. Peppers,\\" and the stained-glass window of the \\"Wild Honey\\" is far more electric than the oatmeal bland blankness of the \\"White Album.\\"
B00000K19E|5.0|The comparisons of THE MATRIX to  STAR WARS, as paradoxically odd and fitting as that maybe, are now I'm sure as legendary as the movie itself.  Yet it cannot be said enough for a powerful reason.<br />There is a new paradigm of thought in town, bringing us in to the 21st century with both precedented and unprecedented power, grace and style.  In psychology in the earlier part of the 20th century, Jung the spiritualist/linguist so upset the applecart of Freud the biologist that it ushered in a whole new way to see humanity--respecting and including the ones that came before it in its new perspective.  But Stanislov Grof, with his scientific mysticism, jumped so far beyond Jung that he makes him look like early Freud in comparison, and as such prepares us for the 21st century.  Equally and similiarly, before the seventies, one can see the plethora of movies influenced by the Freudian perspective on human life and Western Culture (think Hitchcock), and their often amazing quality and insight.  George Lucas, however, building on that Jazz mystic Stanley Kubrick, decided to come along and do an Ali (&quot;I'll shake up the World!!!!!!&quot;) and give us a Jungian anthropological/mythological masterpiece underneath innovative special effects, changing movie making forever.  There was really almost nowhere new to go in science fiction or action movies in their entirety after STAR WARS...until the Wachowski Brothers, like Grof to Jung, showed us directly what Lucas hinted at cryptically: INNER Space is the only space.<br />STAR WARS, after the several years we needed to catch on, allegorically introduced the geater world to the symphonic poetry of the Post-Jungian Mythographer and genius Joseph Campbell. THE MATRIX reintroduces us to the myth and mysticism that still forms the foundation of our culture and consciousness, as Campbell said, but in the context of *Michael Talbott* (see the book, THE HOLOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE): the quantum leap above and beyond Jung and Campbell for our post-Einstein time.  And it does so in a way that will be the standard for all myth-making and story-telling in Hollywood for quite some time, I'm sure.  Yet like all great movies, knowing why it is so great doesn't stop you from enjoying it.  Neither does seeing it a bunch of times!  There is something new to mine from this movie every time you see it, because of the divine truths it thematically and metaphorically underscores.<br />Naturally, you can't ignore the obvious: the special effects and cinematography are from another planet.  The fight choreography is the closest thing to ballet before CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON (and by the same fight choreographer). Laurence Fishburne is, well, Laurence Fishburne (any OTHELLO fans out there, with Kenneth Branaugh as Iago?). And, saints be praised, this is also one of the few movies that Keanu not only didn't stink in (and that's coming from someone who liked SPEED and POINT BREAK and THE DEVIL'S ADVOCATE and so on), but used his limited acting technique to transcend its own limitations and egolessly tell the story better than anyone could have.  But the trick is that all of the above could have sucked with a script as powerful as this one--because of it being so masterfully written--and the movie would have still been wonderful.  The script brings out all of the above mentioned spritual themes, in a way that an eleven year old (like my son) could click on to, but not even a brain surgeon (like Pribram?) or an astrophysicist (like Bohm?) could ignore.  This is the real reason why you can watch this movie 16 times and still see it again as if it was the first.<br />Own this.

B00005N9CV|3.0|Diana finally hits me with a refreshing release, well somewhat.  The title track does wonders for her as that is the most perfect melody and lyric for her, along with Dancing in the Dark.  However, what in the world did she do with S'wonderful and Besame Mucho. ??? Oh and Cry Me River, did bring me to tears. As I continue to listen, I sometimes find myself yawning to sleep.  Her lazy voice goes into the lush instrumental interludes that are wonderful but then back into the lyric and yawn.  I would like to see a shot of adrenaline given to her, spice it up a bit break new ground, rock that piano a bit.  Everyone else has in their great careers, why not Diana.  Imagine S'wonderful with a bit of a swing to it.  Overall this is not a bad release, I just keep expecting more only to get the same predictable routine.

B00005OM4N|5.0|As it's been said in the music world, the 3rd album is the tell-tale sign of an artist's future.  Madonna's 3rd album, True Blue, was a bevy of songs from different genres (e.g. &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot;) and it displayed her staying power in the pop world.<br />Britney's 3rd album has shown her maturity as both an artist and performer and really put her on a path, in the way of Madonna.  Her ability to vary her musical talent and her marketing magic will keep her in the limelight.  Some may scoff at the mention of musical talent and Britney Spears in the same sentence but who cares?  The music is fun and funky.  If anything else, she's fun to look at because she has incredible dancing ability and stage presence.  If you missed Britney on the David Letterman show (11/8/01), then you missed out on a great performance.
6300247120|5.0|This movie touches a very common human aspect.  The lives of the Cutters and the meaning behind their name, that is what makes this movie soo cool.  The soundtrack to this movie is SPECTACULAR!  I wish I could buy it!  Together, this movie is 5 stars!
B00005NW02|5.0|System's newest disc if so much more intelligent than anything I have heard in a long time.  The music is so powerfull that you just would expect the lyrics to be the typical crap, more screaming and spitting.  I used to listen to metal back in the day but then it just got stupid.  People were just going for shock value than actual good music.  This has the right combination of screaming and growling with unreal smart lyrics that will have you thinking about them for hours.  Do your self a favor and buy this CD today then listen to it 10 times and read the lyrics in the notes.  This is guarenteed to make you feel like you are a rock star or something.

It will be a amazing album just like all Sade's other albums.
B000002JPA|5.0|Since Amazon.com is my favorite web site, I read a lot of people's reviews to find some new music.  Thanks to Lord Chimp and the_wickerman (the two best reviewers on this site), I have discovered a new progressive metal band called Dream Theater.  They're not really new; in fact they've been around for 15 plus years, but they're new to me.  And I must say that I am truly impressed.  On a whim, I went and bought Dream Theater's second album, 1992's IMAGES AND WORDS, since many fans say it's their best work.  This is my first DT album, so I can't tell you which one of their records is better, but I must say that this is an excellent album.<br />In order to describe Dream Theater's sound, I'll put it this way: combine the technical flash of Rush with the melodic bent of '70s arena rock and stir it up with the heavy metal assault of Metallica and Iron Maiden.  Although DT's influences are noticeable, they are not derivative (like Lenny Kravitz, for example).  These five guys are absolutely incredible musicians, but they don't let their instrumental prowess overwhelm the music.  It's good to see a band doing this kind of music today and refusing to buck down to pointless trends.<br />For an album that contains only 8 songs that total over almost an hour long, there's a lot going on here.  &quot;Take the Time&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot; contain complex jam sections that we haven't seen since the glory days of Yes.  &quot;Another Day&quot; is a real tear-jerker that is a step above your average power ballad, with an extremely powerful vocal performance by lead singer James LaBrie.  The aggressive &quot;Under a Glass Moon&quot; finds drummer Mike Portnoy bashing the hell out of his kit like the step-child of Neil Peart and guitarist John Petrucci wailing solo after amazing solo.  The highlight of the album is the opening track &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; with its monster guitar riffs, perfect musicianship, and VERY deep lyrics.  Overall, I&amp;W is a great album and I will be buying more DT records in the future.
6304118392|5.0|In think this is the best movie ever to be released.<BR>It is very creative and is very well casted, acted, edited, directed and scripted.<BR>I dont care what anyone says, and I mean it when I say it<BR>&quot;IT IS THE BEST&quot;. Dont worry about what people say about it or what I say about it. Have your own opinion.<BR>It is very violent but it delivers a message.<BR>If you think it doesn't, look harder. It does. Besides the message it's designed to give, it is also the best Action/Drama you'll find. It is a love or hate movie I think. If you rent it and get half way through it and think it's crap DONT TURN IT OFF, the end half of the movie in the jail is better in alot of peoples opinion. I think its all suberb. They couldn't of picked a better cast it's perfect.<BR>DONT MISS IT, IT&quot;S THE BEST FILM EVER MADE

B00005OM4N|5.0|If you don't like this cd I think you have a HUGE problem. All you Britney haters need to get a life and actually realize that Britney has talent! She doesn't get near the credit she deserves from her last three albums. She is a good singer, incredible dancer, and writes her own music. If that's not talent, I don't know what the heck is! Every track on this cd is amazing and really catchy. I'm a Slave 4 You is a dance classic. The pulse-pounding beat is very sexy and you can't help but wanna dance. Overprotected is very mature and I think all teenagers can probably relate to it. Lonley is really cool because it is different than anything Britney has ever done before. It is very rockish and Britney carries it off great. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman is fantastic. Britney's voice has never sounded better and whether you a guy or girl you can probably relate to this song. Boys is deffinately a highlight on this cd. A very danceable song and really HOT. Kind of like I'm a Slave 4 You. Anticipating is another dance track and it is really sweet. I love this song! I Love Rock N Roll is always a good song no matter who does it! Cinderella is very different and a more mature pop song. Let Me Be is a great song! The chorus is totally catchy and you will never get it stuck out of your head. Bombastic Love is catchy and upbeat. Basically the only typical pop song on the record.(It's still darn good though)That's Where you Take Me is one of my favorites on the album. It is really sweet and romantic.What It's Like To Be Me is ingenious! Extremely creative and funky. Sounds almost like a Janet Jackson song. <BR>If you go out and buy any cd this year, Britney is a must have!Britney Spears should be proud of herself for showing her awesome talent on this incredible cd.
B00005R62N|5.0|This one is considered Judas Priest's breakthrough classic, and rightfully so.  Although too produced to call it a real \\"live\\" record, it may be better to think of it as a re-recorded best of their previous efforts (`Sad Wings of Destiny' (1976), `Sin After Sin' (1977), `Stained Class' (1978), and `Hell Bent for Leather' (1978)).  That is, all the songs here are performed with an improved more metallic, more up tempo sound than the original versions - the tempo is a little faster on \\"Exciter\\", the guitar solo is a little more daring on \\"Sinner\\", the chords ring a little harder on \\"Green Manalishi\\", the licks are a little edgier on \\"Diamonds and Rust\\".   But the essential performance here is \\"The Ripper\\" - the original of which was drenched with silly sound effects and seemed out-of-place on `Sad Wings of Destiny' (1976)  - but the version here is simply incredible.  In fact, I challenge anyone to find a metal song with a more impressive vocal performance (including any later Judas Priest records).<br />The original release contained nine songs with an emphasis on tunes taken from their pre-major label record, `Sad Wings of Destiny' (1976) and only one or two songs each from `Sin After Sin' (1977), `Stained Class' (1978), and `Hell Bent for Leather' (aka `Killing Machine' (1978)).  On bootlegs and certain \\"official\\" releases, other songs from these concerts/session later emerged, creating a broader representation of their catalog up to that point.  The original record probably should have been a double album, but now with the benefit of the extended format of CDs, it is all here, including the infamous live version of \\"Hell Bent for Leather\\" (sans the revving Harley), which became the signature encore of subsequent Judas Priest shows.<br />In my opinion, as important as Judas Priest was to the metal scene, this record surpasses any of their previous five prior releases.

He has made his point in management theory; the business as usual approach of established companies is their handicap with disruptive innovations. Although his framework to explain the struggle of established companies and innovation is very useful the book doesn't get into the question; 'how to deal with disruptive innovation' ?  i recommend you read 'the innovators dilemma' in combination with books like 'corporate venturing', 'radical innovation' or 'webs of innovation' that go on where christensen ends. however overall this is an absolute must read to understand the struggle of established companies and (disruptive) innovation

Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed each and every word of this exquisite story about myths and rituals or the lack thereof in American culture.  Much of what the characters speak about ring true and Mr. Gaiman does a great job of making the reader connect with the underlying themes sprinkled throughout the book.  A Thought provoking book that will keep you wondering about the things you believe in.
0767805712|1.0|Gattaca has a fascinating premise, but lousy execution, because the director forgot the single most important precept of movie-making: the audience must have an emotional relationship with the protagonist.  There are no likable characters in this movie.  Not a one.  Sure, both Ethan and Uma are fantastic LOOKING, but that's the point of genetic selection anyhow.  Their choices, their lives, their whining about the limitations on their priviledged life... none of it speaks to an actual human.<br />Brazil did it better.

B000002KB8|5.0|This is one amazing record. This is the birth of metal. Sure, Paranoid got more popular and Master of Reality had more gloomy riffs, but this is the birth of heavy metal. In fact, this isn't heavy metal at all! It's distorted blues! For those who argue with me, listen to Wicked World, and you'll see what i'm talking about. Pure blues. This album was also very experimental. It's the only time you'll hear them with a harmonica, or a saxaphone(Evil Woman from the english version). The highlight isn't Black Sabbath or N.I.B, but actually it's Warning. 14 minutes long, it has some of the best experimental-blues-metal playing ever. The beginning to the song, Sleeping Village, has some weird digirido on it. This is amazing. Metal fans will not be dissapointed. Reccomended for anyone.
B00000GAIW|3.0|Tull has been beating the whole pompous prog flute rock thing into the ground for 30 years now.  But back in the day, this was not a bad album. <br />The religiosity can wear thin after a while and some of the best songs, like Cheap-Day Return, seem like mere afterthoughts than fully-developed pieces. Locomotive Breath and Cross-Eyed Mary are better than the title track.  And the not-often-played songs are worth the price of the CD.
630588255X|1.0|I had a longer review here previously describing in detail why this movie is the stuff of sewers, but what's the point? Watch it, love it, imagine yourself as free and wild as wacky red-headed grandma, put on an ugly dress and go down the drum circle and sing your little heart out. Just don't do it near my place cuz I'll throw birdseed in your hair.<br /><br />Quirky is a disease of the deranged mind.
B00000AOUD|3.0|This is some of the best that prog/epic rock has to offer. The lyrics are obscure and pedantic, and trade on mystical imagery. The 45 minute &quot;song&quot; is actually a series of 4 or 5 minute songs that are linked together either by the common story-line, such as it is, or musical themes. The story itself is a puzzle, but it features poets, lords and milking-girls and other assorted English imagery.<br />The first half is stronger than the second, and the bridge between the first and second parts is atrocious. But if you like the first 4 minutes, which is a staple of the classic radio format, and a rock flautist then by all means pick this up.  There's at least 20 minutes of excellent stuff here for you.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|What the heck is the problem? Andy Spletzer and Leonard Maltin made a very poor review of this movie. Gone in 60 seconds is an awesome action/comedy movie that is about some car theifs (one being Nic Cage) that are retired, but came back for his brother. Some other old partners come back to help him. This has good acting by Cage, he is also funny, and cool at the same time. This movie also has an awesome soundtrack. I have no idea why Spletzer and Maltin think this is &quot;mindless&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;. Almost every movie Maltin reviews he calls stupid, and I'm sick of it. I use to respect some his reviews, but now he has lost peoples trust. People who have not seen this, watch it, and don't go by Spletzer and Maltin's review. Hopfilly Amazon will take note to this review. 5/5 *****
B000050HTO|3.0|This album is a good for anyone new to Bob Dylan, or for those on a low budget. It delivers what it says it does; the essential Dylan tracks are here; his hits and songs that were covered by others and made into hits. It spans his career decently, though they could have fit many more songs on these 2 disks...<br />With an artist like Dylan, with so many of his albums being so good all the way through, this album should be just seen as an introduction to the man. And if you are just looking for just one Dylan album this one isn't too bad.<br />However, Dylan has many great albums, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited,&quot; &quot;Blonde on Blonde,&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; are essential for any classic rock fan, though this is a decent place to start.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Without a doubt...Star Trek: The Motion Picture has finally arrived. Certainly not perfect...but it is, as Mr. Wise eloquently points out in the commentary track, the best it probably can be...which, if I may be so bold, is a remarkable demonstration of how an editor can make or break a film.<br />Truly I am in awe of Mr. Wise's mastery of bringing a new, dramatically more insightful, ebb and flow to what was/is essentially a static, parlor drama set in outer space. I don't think of myself as being easily seduced...but, strangely, enough I found myself captured and enthralled anew by a film I know like the back of my hand. <br />Of course, the blame for this sort of geeky awareness would have to fall at the feet of Jerry Goldsmith who, if he hadn't imagined such a glorious musical universe for the Enterprise to soar, I would not have returned these past 20 years, again and again, to a film that had been so ingloriously dubbed as 'Star Trek: The Motionless Picture'!<br />Well, it's not &quot;motionless&quot; anymore.<br />For 20 years Star Trek: TMP has held the steadfast appreciation of those who understood the film's bumpy ride to the big screen and the 'race-the-clock' challenges faced by the entire production staff - -- because, let's face it --- all the ingredients of a noteworthy film were already there...they just simply ran out of time. With the televising of the extended version this became even more clear. Still, who would have guessed Paramount would ever oblige Mr. Wise (let alone the fans) with the opportunity to correct such an oversight.<br />For those who belied the film it's lack of warmth and sterility, here we have in the Director's Special Edition a re-focusing of what Star Trek has always been about: the characters. With the simple addition of one brief scene here, the re-cutting of another or just a simple reaction shot...our attention is always brought back to the characters, creating a completely unique emotional experience. Goodness, even theDecker/Ilia story arc has more poignancy.<br />Technically speaking, yes, the print utilized for this transfer is not ideal in spots. But, most definitely, the new sound design brings alive sequences as they never had been before. (Still, in the defense of old sound effects put out to pasture...I do prefer the old klaxon and masculine voice of alarm). Also, while it is true they had to trim and excise certain portions of Jerry Goldsmith's score...they are judicious and remarkably sensitive.<br />And so, once more, the much maligned offspring of Gene Roddenberry sails forth from drydock into the gaping maw of public opinion but, this time though, it wisely remembered to patch all the holes.
1577311760|5.0|...Because here is where you learn to begin *finding* it.  I bought this book cynically, because I was sick of reading ancient expositions on dead religious ideas and wanted something relevant.  But I'd never read anything modern that did anything but make me roll my eyes.  Oh, and I accidentally bought the audio version; I meant to order the book.  Eckhart's voice made me chuckle and his words struck me as &quot;harmless&quot; for about ten minutes.  And then he changed my entire life.  From that day on, I have focused my energy on better understanding and applying what I've learned from just these tapes (mind you, it takes me about a month to assimilate most teachings, and assimilating teachings is what I do).  I will never stop, because there is no end to the truth that this book teaches.
B0000009OX|5.0|This lp has 23 songs, all of which are classics.First of their material and the earlier stuff has the more raw feel and is therefore the best.<BR>Highlights of the album are:Girls don't like it, Male Model, I Gotta Getta, Jump Boys, Here comes the summer(Used in a recent impulse advert), Get over you(undoubtedly the Undertones best achievement-peaked at 52????????TRUE PUNK!!!), Jimmy Jimmy, Smarter than You, Top 20(Heavy rock chanting involved), Mars Bars(the most innocent punk song ever written-almost Ramonesesque). Great album from a truely timeles band.Who else could write a sond about Masturbation and have it enter the Charts, in a time when the sex pistols are kept off number 1 for slagging the monarchy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005N9CV|3.0|This is not Diana at her best in my opinion.  It is a quite slow and moody almost to the point of melodramatic.  Her spanish in <BR>Besame Mucho is a bit over articulated as Bay Sa May which drives me crazy when I listen to it.  If you are an die hard fan, you will probably like it but not love it.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have no idea what is wrong with the Amazong reviewer, but I had the privilege of seeing John in concert last night after the insistance of my friends and I am wowed by his amazing vocal and musical talent. I was an instant fan. His songs are amazingly catchy but not trite---original and multi-layered. I could really tell that he loved his music as he beautifully sang and I could see his fans loved him too as they sang every word. Room for Squares is an awesome CD with not one song that I skip over. Great guitar, great voice. What more could I ask for?
B00003CXXI|5.0|My girls and I watch this movie night after night and still find the humor, the love, and the adventure in it.  I would recommend someone to purchase this movie.  It was absoulutly amazing.
B00003CXE6|4.0|At this point, I haven't even begun to pick out the innaccuracies of this film. But, of course, there are, inevitably, the justfiyable comparisons to \\"Braveheart\\". A blue-eyed Australian-raised actor playing a warrior avenging the death of his family, a tall, willowy noblewoman (and probable victim of incest at the hands of a power-mad ruler)supporting the wronged warrior and visting him in prison, a profiteer helping to bring about the lead character's downfall,the foriegn-born friend who acts as an encourager to the hero, the wise old ruler who dies leaving unresolved issues...Yes, indeed, folks, the Best Picture winners are starting to look too much alike, especially since both \\" Braveheart\\" and \\"Gladiator\\" feature scar-faced Tommy Flannagan as an ill-fated supporter of the hero.<BR> As Maximus, Russell Crowe, is staid, stoic, and stocky looking. He has a beautifully thick neck and fine muscular build like the expatriated American Aussie who paved the way for other actors from Down Under. But,while he evokes sympathy when mourning the murders of his wife and son, he lacks Gibson's passion and expressiveness.<BR> Whoever cast Joaquin Phoenix as the evil Emperor Commodus must have seen the large sculpted head of Constantine the Great that is in the Capitoline Museum in Rome, for with his large, deep-set, but rather sickly-looking eyes, Phoenix certainly resembles it.<BR> Frail-looking Richard Harris is the ever-wise Marcus Aurelius. Despite his fragility, he is still elegant of voice, and clear of mind as he wisely chooses Maximus to succeed him. Harris is still impressive to watch onscreen because in the body of this frail-looking old man is a lot of charisma.<BR> In his final role, we have the sullen Oliver Reed as a profiteer who enslaves the grieving Maximus and places him in a life-threatening situation. Anyone who saw him in \\"Oliver\\", \\"Tommy\\", \\"Condorman\\", etc., knew he was good in such roles.<BR> Danish-born Connie Nielsen, who bears enough resemblance to the Danish Queen, Margarethe in real life, plays the Emperor's sister, Lucilla in this movie. Her \\"Braveheart\\", counterpart, of course, is Sophie Marceau. -A statuesque natural beauty, who can play very strong-willed characters with aplomb, and comfort the hero during his final hours. The way Ancient Roman jewelry hangs on Ms. Nielsen is very graceful.<BR> Djimon Honsou's Juba is the foreign-born supporter who comforts Maximus after the loss of his family and is still standing at the end of the story.<BR> I didn't see as much of David Hemmings as I would have liked in this movie. But considering his relationship with Richard Harris in \\"Camelot\\", it's interesting to see the two work together again.<BR> The arena scenes are fast-paced and graphic. But Maximus' warrior skills are extremely helpful in keeping the number of casualties of his men to a minimum, whether on a battle field or in the arena. The scene where a female charioteer is cut down at her midsection is particularly startling.<BR> The camera visuals are exhorbitant, as Maximus the Spaniard feels his time on Earth ebbing and his reunion with his wife and son imminent. We can feel his pull towards the afterlife slowly gaining momentum, until he finally wanders through golden fields of wheat towards his loved ones on his way to eternal happiness.<BR> Whether or not the costumes were accurate, the colors were regal, rich, and splendid, and the overall statliness and grandeur that was Rome was magnificently recaptured. Humming through it all is an exotic score with a certain mysticism about it.<BR> Ridley Scott directed this with as much intensity as was seen in \\"1492\\", and it is an intensity that has paid off for him.
B00003CXWV|4.0|this film concentrates on the life of George jung who became the larest importer of columbian cocaine in american history. the film throughout is very stylish and thought provoking. the film follows the life of george jung as he rises through the drug business eventually becomming pabloescobars Main Man. Although the film has many good parts however, it is overall let down by its lack of action and can get alittle boring. to say it tells the story of one of the most notorious drug lords of the 20th century there isnt enough goin on to warrent the 2 hours plus that the movie lasts.instead of being a narcotic adventure the film feels ke more of a dope opera which i didnt expect. Apart from that this is an entertaining film that is extremely welldirected and well polished. its a good film and there is no argument about hat,however dont expect blow to get you high.
B00005B36H|5.0|I bought this CD because of all the rave reviews I've heard about it literally everywhere on the net.<br />I hadn't ever heard Schism - and I don't think it's particularly amazing........just the best rock song ever played on the radio from the last ten years.<br />That paragraph doesn't make much sense, does it?<br />Well, consider this - I feel that Schism isn't the best song on Lateralus - and yet it beats everything else in rock (I MEAN EVERYTHING) played on the radio.....forget about different genres of rock.<br />Realize that musicianship is the deciding facor for purity and power in music. Tool is a GREAT band - awesome musicians. The only other band that can compete on this front (musicianship) would be Dave Matthews Band. And, frankly, Dave just doesn't know how to write lyrics as well as Maynard.<br />Speaking of lyrics, the only album I've heard that has lyrics on par with this albums's poetry would be Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd......<br />I could go on.<br />But I won't.<br />Lateralus is an experience. Tool is a great band. Buy the album already.
B00000JGEN|3.0|This was an okay movie. I liked it okay. But it wasn't something I would watch over and over again. It is a good future movie. But I think it sucks how everything happens. The way the movie begins with Arnold getting set up for a crime he didn't commit and sent to prison for a year and a half. Then forced to go on an evil sadistic gameshow. I think that was too much abuse to Arnold's character. Trying to make an innocent man look like one of the most dangerous men in the world. A psycho who kills innocent people for no reason. Too much happened to him to make me glad I'm not him. He fought four tough guys: Sub-Zero, Buzzsaw, Dynamo, and Fireball. They seemed like real tough guys almost impossible to beat. Especially Sub-Zero. The way he knocked Arnold unconscious at first sight and the blck guy had to nearly do all the work. Buzzsaw seemed a little difficult at first but was taken out when Arnold used his own chainsaw against him by cutting hs balls with it. Dynamo didn't seem to hard. He just had that electric shock tht killed the nerdy guy. Arnold took him out like he was a piece of cake. But he didn't die and was seen roaming later in the film. Arnold's girl helper killed him by shooting a pipe and showering water sprinkles all over his elctronic armor. Fireball was pretty tough, but not as much as Sub-Zero. He had that massive flame thrower. I thought he would be a scary opponent if fighting him in real life. Buzzsaw and Dynamo seemed like Bebop and Rocksteady from TMNT. Two stupid super villains. But Sub-Zero and Fireball seemed like two tough guys if you weren't careful, you're a dead man. Arnold as Ben Richards, THE RUNNING MAN. Riding in a chopper of anti-hero cops. He was being ordered to draw fire uon innocent civilins, but resisted and said \\"The hell with you!\\" They all knocked him out and followed the command. The videos installed on camera were sabotaged and framed Ben Richards for murders he didn't commit. He sure went through embarrassment and humiliation as the evil gameshow host put him on the show and showed the forged video. But in the end the (...) gameshow host was taught a lesson when the true video was shown and the audience learned he was lying. I'm glad Arnold killed him the way he did. Great Movie. But not Arnold's best.
B00005QG9J|4.0|This album deserves four and a half stars, so I put four.  It is incredible, they have beautiful melodies, incredible guitar playing, brandon boyd has one of the best male voices out there.  Not quite as good as Make Yourself, but so different that it is still really good.  I love how each and every album they put out is different from the last, excellent and musically tight band.
1558908420|3.0|If not for De Niro, Keitel and Stallone -- this movie would've been a disgusting failure.  The actors somehow manage to make it worth watching (if you are the above-mentioned guys' fan).
B00000IMCU|3.0|The first time I watched &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; I was a freshman in high school. The only reason I rented it was because good old Roger Ebert had praised the film so highly as to call it one of the best horror films ever made, along with a nice little 4-star-with-comment plug on the box. I watched the film in the confines of my little up-north trailer, the images flooding my head. By the end, I came to a simple conclusion: I hated this movie with every part of my being. I was expecting something utterly catastrophic; something so grueling and unforgettable it would make &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; look like Levar Burton reading The Three Little Pigs on Reading Rainbow. I didn't get what I expected. I hung on every word of dialogue, hoping and praying for a smashing conclusion that would make me forget the first hour and a half of the film, forgiving the director's ills. After all, this man made &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; one of the truly ultimate horror films of the past 50 years. I felt cheated when it was over and I went to bed with visions of severed heads and plodding zombies dancing in my head like sugarplums are supposed to. The years past, and something weird kept happening: I couldn't get the damn movie out of my mind. It kept creeping around in my memory whenever discussions of horror films came up. I could still envision a lot of the sequences exactly as they happened, and I could hear that one dude saying the infamous &quot;When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth&quot; quote that taglines the front of every video. This pointed to a truth I didn't want to face: &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; was a memorable, affecting film that got under my skin despite my undying hatred for it. So I decided to ante up and use a free Blockbuster coupon (I don't gamble with cash on movies I hated) to rent it once again, with fresh eyes and a developed appreciation for filmmaking. I watched it over the span of three days (Day One: I was tired, Day Two: I was busy, Day Three: I finally had an hour or two to spare), and guess what, I liked it. It got me thinking about a Spielberg on Kubrick interview I saw, where he admits that he didn't like &quot;The Shining&quot; when he first saw it (heh, neither did I), but now he's seen it 25 times: one of his favorite films. I doubt this film will ever rank in that distinction, but I'll probably rent it again in another month or so, when I'm not tired or busy, and can pay full attention.<br />Anywho, to the review part: &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is not terrifying at all in the traditional sense. It's got an underlying feeling of horror to it that makes it very unique. The tension isn't really building so much as it remains steady, mostly between our characters, not so much the zombies. But the movie isn't about the zombies. It's about us, the people who are left to battle them in our quest for survival, and how, even in the gravest of situations, we still desperately seek material comfort in the midst of chaos. And more than anything (this is the most terrifying truth of all, which leads to a great sequence involving a band of looters) we will do anything to &quot;protect our stuff.&quot; George Romero is excellent with satire. His most recent film, &quot;Bruiser,&quot; is an excellent example of this, but you can definitely see him stretching his muscles to the limit with this film, which gets under our skin on a weird level and makes us sort of afraid of ourselves. In essence, it's us that are uncivilized; the monsters. The zombies, simply acting on instinct with nothing but the primal jelly of their deadened brains to keep them going, are blameless. It's a different way of looking at this genre of horror film, and while I rate this at the same level as Lucio Fulci's gore-soaked &quot;Zombie,&quot; which was released the same year in Italy, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is actually a much better film because of that skewed perspective. This film isn't terrifying because of its plentiful gore or the savagery of the zombies: It's terrifying because it's so brutally truthful and horrifically satirical that you can't get it out of your head for a long time after. This is one for film classes to discuss.ifying because of its plentiful gore or the savagery of the zombies: It's terrifying because it's so brutally truthful and horrifically satirical that you can't get it out of your head for a long time after.

0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is one of the ingenius novels in the history of all time. It deals with a teenage boy named Alex who lives in England. And when night comes, he and his teenage &quot;droogs&quot; or friends (in Russian) go out and wreak havoc on the city. During one of the groups ultra-violent encounters, Alex accidently kills an old woman. To add up on to the incredibly frustrating situation for Alex, his friends betray him and leave him to be for the police. Stuck in prison, Alex wants to get out as quickly as possible. He starts to suck up to the warden by reading the bible and trying to be &quot;friendly&quot; to be let out earlier than the original sentence of 14 years. Since Alex is 15 at the time of his sentence. To go through his entire sentence, he would be 29 at the age of his release. Alex finds out about a certain technique that is used on prison inmates to make sure that they get out of prison and never return. Almost drooling, Alex finds himself very interested in getting out of prison. He volunteers to have himself as a test subject for the technique. The basic procedure of the technique is to give the patient a certain drug that makes that patient extremely sick. The doctors and scientists then strap down the patient in front of a screen and hold back his eyelids by tape so that he would be brainwashed in a way. Watching the most violent and gruesome of films, Alex is slowly brainwashed to a state where anything that has to do with violence in Alex's mind would automatically engage a very nauseating and stressing feeling makeing Alex extremely sick. After two weeks of the procedures, Alex is let out of the hospital where he was being &quot;treated&quot; and &quot;cleansed.&quot; Alex is then rejected by his parents, by his friends, and by his earlier enemies. Being beaten by those who he hurt before prison, and being extremely exauhsted, Alex comes into the possesion of certain rebels of the government. The rebels want to use Alex to overthrow thegovernment which seems to be so cruel and bad. To do this, they want to have Alex commit suicide to show that the treatments that the governemtn applied to prisons is bad and that it leads patients to commit suicide. Jumping out of a window out of extreme frustration, Alex survives and is sent to a hospital to be treated. The government takes control of Alex again and turns him back to his original violent self. Alex enjoying the fact that he can control his emotions and violent feelings once more believe that he is fully cured. Back on the streets of England now at the age of 18, Alex starts to move away from the violent feelings in his life. Wanting more out of life, Alex begins a new era of his life. Escaping out of the animal called youth. This story explains, in great words, the idea that everything changes no matter what. We don't need machines, or governements to make everything &quot;okay.&quot; All that we need is to live our lives and let the universe unfold as it should.

B000002672|3.0|Accept has always been a band not for the faint at heart;their demolishing guitar attack,complete with a powerful rhytm section and Udo Dirkschneider's vocals propelled them to a cult status among the most rabid metal fans.This 1986 opus marked a twist in the road,where they took a slightly more commercial approach,and yet retained a vigorous sound,e.g.,&quot;T.V.War&quot;,&quot;Heaven is Hell&quot;,&quot;Aiming High&quot;,etc.Without doubt,this is one of their most accomplished works.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I want to point out my reaction to one specific song, the one that has the same title of the CD: \\"The look of love\\".<br />This incredibly sexy song (by Bacharach) was specially created for Dusty Springfield's voice. Dusty's version (10th song in ASIN B000059T9M) differs from Diana's in several dimensions, as anyone could tell.<br />Diana's version has a relatively long instrumental prelude before her voice appears singing the title line \\"The look... of love... is in... your eyes...\\". I say \\"relatively long\\" because Dusty's voice opens the song right away amidst the darkest of silences, before any other instrument has dared to make any sound. This straightforwardness sets an unbelievably sensual atmosphere, even before the first second of the song has gone by, as if by magic. Also, Dusty's background music is somewhat more sensual (in my opinion, anyway), I would even say more directly sexual, probably due to the 60's \\"sound\\". In my mind I have this stereotype of a really sexy song from the 60's that Dusty's interpretation exemplifies perfectly. Moreover, the trademark weak-saxo sound in Dusty's version is completely absent in Diana's version. These sorts of details, and Dusty's particularly silky voice, make a huge aesthetic difference for the experience of listening to this specific song.<br />Some of Diana's songs in other CD's could be declared *the* combo interpretations, and surely by overwhelming concensus (e.g. \\"Peel me a grape\\", or \\"When I look in your eyes\\"). No way any other version will ever overthrow them as *the* interpretations for those songs. Actually I even do like her \\"Look of love\\" (pun intended?), but in my humble opinion, Diana's interpretation is really no match for Dusty's masterpiece.<br />Don't get me wrong, I love Diana Krall and her music. Have been a Krall fan since I first heard her voice on the TV a few years ago, have 4 of her cd's -including this one, and I even had a chance to see her in person at the New Orleans Jazz Fest 2000 whereI got her Love Scenes CD autographed. I really think she is among the most talented Jazz performers around, especially as a singer with such a dark sexy voice, though so many people are more amazed with her piano. On top of everything, needless to say she is gorgeous. And by the way, this CD's booklet takes amazing advantage of her beauty, and I mean AMAZING.<br />Musically speaking though, this particular song \\"The look of love\\" for me is one case in which a given interpretation is heard for a song/arrangement/singer combo, you get stuck to it, and then the song seems always attached to that combo. With any change in it, any other interpretation of the same song sounds somewhat not as authentic, just missing too many things that were already darn perfect.
B00000JMOF|5.0|After repeated attempts of securing a Frankenstein, director James Whale hired a middle-aged character actor named William Henry Pratt (stage name: Boris Karloff) who had previously been limited to cameos, stand-ins, and predominantly small eccentric parts to play Frankenstein's monster. Karloff's restrictive age, massive obscurity, and absence of experience may have emerged as hindrances for this newly discovered personality. However, time and popular opinion has obliterated these fears into long lost paranoid  hallucinations.<br />It is Boris Karloff's indisputably iconic and singularly haunting performance as the child-like brute, misunderstood and despised by all, whose only longing and desire is to be loved and cared for by others that continues to be one of cinema's timeless jewels of acting perfection, dramatic magnitude, and note-fully seamless pathos. Karloff's monster, like Anthony Perkin's Norman Bates or Robert De Norio's Travis Bickle, is one of cinema's fortunate accidents of how the exact casting of just the right perfect someone can unbelievably bolster the film.  Karloff's casting as the inevitably sympathetic artificial concoction of a mad scientist with a deity complex turned out to be one of many grandiose happy accidents that has allowed this 70 year-old gothic horror film to continue to be copiously admired, internationally beloved, and enthusiastically cherished up to contemporary times.<br />Frankenstein retains numerous stellar elements including a magnificently captivating early sound ensemble cast including Edward Van Sloan (Doctor Waldman), Mae Clarke (Elizabeth), Frederick Kerr (Baron Frankenstein), Dwight Frye (Fritz), and the unforgettable Colin Clive, the archetypal mad scientist,  (Henry Frankenstein), brilliantly provocative Frankenstein make-up by make-up genius Jack Pierce, manically splendid and cleverly articulated German Expressionistic sets ,that place this tale in an indescribable alternate Grimm Fairy Tale reminiscent landscape, James Whales immeasurably eloquent moral consolidation and inventively multi-faceted interpretation of Mary Shelly's tale, and forever crowned with one of cinema's most cunningly virtuoso and unredeemable bravura performances of inarticulate primal indignation and childish rage ever recorded on film by Karloff as the monster. <br />However due to it's age and Hollywood production values at the time, Frankenstein is not totally absent of problems: lacking of a musical score to countermarch the film's profuse talkativeness, predictably saddled with pedestrian and extremely dated comedic and romantic sub plots, and weakened by an awfully trite comedic conclusion. Despite these blemishes, Frankenstein consummately embodies the finest narrative qualities of the early Universal monster films, contains the simply greatest incarnation of Frakenstein's monster, and stubbornly remains both in ambiance and creative evocativeness the finest film version of the Mary Shelly story.<br />Talk about staying power!!! <br />As for Frankenstein's DVD format, it contains a uncannily pristine Pan and Scan<BR>Standard presentation, intriguing Making-Of Documentary, Film Historian Rudy<BR>Behlmer's audio commentary, original theatrical trailer, and much more.<br />Universally (pun intended) recommended to anyone interested in film classics,<BR>the Universal Monster films, or films of the 1930's. Followed by James Whales<BR>superior sequel The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).<br />P.S. Never Give Franky Flower Petals Near a Pond

B00005R23S|5.0|Simply put, this is the greatest concert footage of all time. The Reunion Tour marked the best performaces that the E Street Band, because they are all much better musicians than they used to be. The great part of this video is that i captures how talented these musicians are. This collection proves what i have believed for a long time. There is no better live band than Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Roy Bittan is absolutely amazing on piano, and he gets my vote for the most talented musician in the band. What makes this collection better than the live material on Live 1975/85 is that the band is simply a whole lot better than they used to be. The three guitar arrangement of Bruce, Steve and Nils works well. Danny Federici is outstanding on accordian and organ. Roy is unbelievable. Max, Clarence, and Garry are all improved over previous recordings. Even Patti makes a solid contribution on songs like Mansion on the Hill. <br />This is the best collection that Bruce has ever put out. Period. The band played better than they ever did before. The sound on this live collection is also a whole lot better than it was on Live 1975/85. Bruce's voice comes through a lot clearer, and you really can pick out each instument in the mix. If you are a Springsteen fan, you absolutely must have this DVD.
B00000HYXB|1.0|I enjoy all of J.R.R Tolkien's books, and I enjoy progressive rock like Dream Theater, but I do not enjoy this CD.  First of all, this is not really progressive rock.  All of the songs have the same beats and sound.  There is no progression at all.  The vocals sound like a mixture between opera and distorted throat sounds, which don't combine well.  The songs just sound stupid.  There is no depth.  I recommend not buying this CD.  Instead get a Dream Theater album, or even any project that any of the members of Dream Theater have done(i.e. Transatlantic, LTE), they are all good.  But don't get this, you will be disappointed and after listening to it through one time, you will put it away forever
B000002KLP|4.0|Everything about this album stands out,from the raunchy cover to the sheer elemental joy of the songs.However, my impression is that this album is a sexfest only in appearance,while the reality is that Prince has some powerful energies and deep understanding about human nature and society lurking at the back of these(I believe)intended shockers-keep in mind that &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;was released at the beginning of the Reagan era.Musically,the album is a melange of electronica,funk and concise new wave rock'n'roll,e.g.,&quot;When You Were Mine&quot;,while on &quot;Uptown&quot; his singing in two voices is amazing.&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; has nothing dirty about it,but rather strong and dark undercurrents that thoroughly achieve their purpose.
B00005JKHP|4.0|You can imagine how skeptical I have been when I heard that Paramount was going to re-edit this film and add new digital effects. My attitude was SHOW ME THEN? Well Paramount and Mr. Wise certainly have done just that.<br />I remember seeing this film in 1979 when it was first released.  I watched about 40 minutes of it before I fell fast asleep in my theatre seat. I woke up feeling very guilty just as the movie ended. Even the videocassette version would have the same effect on me. There were all those dark endless shots of VGER that would not hold my interest and some of the editing was missing key story elements which made it hard to follow or get into the story. BUT NOW THIS HAS ALL BEEN CHANGED!<br />I did not fall asleep watching this newly edited directors cut or even grow groggy. In fact to my astonishment the 134 minutes went by quite quickly. Working from the movies original 1979 storyboards Paramount must have literally spent millions of dollars to give this film a rebirth! The new digital visuals enhance the film experience and the director's tight editing keeps your eyes moving.<br />The soundtrack on this movie has now been remixed as it should have been in the first place. You can now clearly hear every instrument and soundeffect clearly.<br />Several scene sequences have been enhanced with added digital images. There is a scene when Spock is on Vulcan to receive the Kolinar discipline. He places his hands in front of him to block out the brightness of the sun and in the original version of this film the next shot we see is a night shot on vulcan. This has now been replaced with incredible visuals. And there are other enhancements throughout this new version.<br />The editing is tight and the directors commentary together with the visual effects people and music composer are valuable assets to this dvd. All the elements are there now so that the story no longer drags but moves at a steady clip. I can't say enough about the reworking of this film. They have made me believe in miracles.<br /> Now if only they could do the same with Star Trek 5 which also needs to be re-worked so that story makes more sense. During the filming of that movie the budget was cut so much that the storyboarded visuals never made it to the big screen. How about it Paramount. Give us a directors cut of that film too!film.

B0000065M3|1.0|&quot;Change of Habit&quot; is easily one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see.  In addition to the fact that each and every production aspect -- e.g., the acting -- is abysmal, the film is hopelessly dated.  It's singularly emblematic of the fatuous film and TV fare of its era, when liberal Hollywood was just beginning to think (using that verb loosely in this case) that self-righteousness and the abrogation of reason would somehow (as if by magic) resolve serious social and cultural conflicts.  Hollywood's approach has become far more sophisticated over the years, though its underlying premise remains as dumb as ever.  Moreover, Hollywood's nascent anti-Catholicism (far cruder and more explicit today) is also evident here.  Liturgical and other forms of unorthodoxy are applauded, apparently because they indicated that the Church was finally leaving the Middle Ages behind (whatever that means).  Oh, please.  Those offensive innovations proved to be a disaster for the Church and the world.  Fortunately for both, a return to orthodoxy is well underway.<br />Oh, and the implied comparison between Our Lord and Mr. Presley made me want to gag.<br />A true Elvis fan (and perhaps a student of Hollywood in the '60s) will likely enjoy this film.  As for the rest of you:  Avoid the leprous &quot;C of H&quot;.
B000002LR6|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the Ministry cd that everybody knows. Why? Well, I don't really know the answer, though with all the additicting tracks, one will not be disappointed while listening to this album.<BR> N.W.O. is an excellent way to kick-start this fast album, with that driving drum beat and howling guitars, this is a excellent song.<BR> Just One Fix is Just As Good, if not BETTER than N.W.O. <BR> TVII is one funny, angry, and cathcy track, all in one. Basically, that's all that could really be said. And oh, don't forget to connect those god-damn dots!<BR> Hero is certianly an excellent track to listen to, espicially during war periods, as it's about soliders who put their lives on the line daily. Excellent track though.<BR> Jesus Built My Hotrod is, without a doubt, the popular track of the album, and one could see why. Catchy riff, lyrics you can't keep up with, and funny interludes, this track has it all.<BR> Scarecrow is a softer one, which reminds me of NIN's Reptile. It's got that dark guitar sound over the pounding drums, and dire lyrics, but overall, this turns out to be a good song, but not the most memorable of the cd.<BR> The last two are my least favorite of the cd, they're just forgetable instrumentals, not even close to the instrumentals on the other albums.<BR> All in all, this is one that you'll dig into at first, but after a few listens, you'll notice that it's not as deep as say Twitch or Filth Pig. Of course, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, because once you listen to the other albums, you'll keep telling yourself you want Just One Fix of Psalm 69!
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie was really good, there were a few flaws but i still gave it 5, it had really good special effects and the plot was really good, the only thing i didnt like was that it started out really exciting and kind of went down from there, but the whole movie was still really good.
B00005JKHP|4.0|I am a fan of the original version of this film (guilty pleasure), though I completely understand people who say it is very longwinded. I had heard initially that this DVD was going to re-edit the film extensively and was going to shorten many of the more longer pointless scenes (Kirk's shuttle tour of the Enterprise, some of the longer cloud sequences, etc). I was under the impression that this was going to be a tighter version of the movie but unfortunately these looonggg scenes still remain in their entirety. <BR>  As far as the re-edits go, there are only a few inserts from the longer 1983 T.V. version and a few deletions from the original theatrical version (or very slight changes) but thats pretty much it. They did do a good job enhancing many of the visual effects much the same way the Star Wars Trilogy was redone years ago. The only complaint I have is the sound seems to be muffled in some areas. It seems like the dialogue and the music are very clear and sharp but everything else is somewhat drowned out, which I found disapointing. <BR>  However to sum up, if you like the original release or the T.V. version you should like this as it really is basically the same.
B000021YQV|4.0|Two months ago, if you asked me who System of a Down was, I'd've not been to answer you. However, after hearing Chop Suey! on the radio and seeing the music video, I immediately began searching for more of their music. I received the CD for my birthday, and let me say, it blows you away. From the first track through the last, the energy never drops, but actually gets higher, (which sounds impossible after hearing Prison Song, which starts this album off.) This CD couldn't get louder or faster in my opinion, and Serj yelling and screaming throughout most of it gives it that edge that somehow works perfectly. If you're looking for a band that'll pump you up, SoaD is the band for you. Get this CD if you're a rock fan, and you'll love it, just as I do. Great deal.
B00005HXP9|3.0|There are some really good songs on this album, that's<BR>why I gave it 3 stars - if this is one of your very first<BR>Scorpions albums, it may be worth buying.<br />For the rest of us, this is simply just another remix of<BR>their soft-rock-pop commercial songs; virtually all of them<BR>have already been used in more than one of their previous<BR>albums before.<br />Come on, Scorprions, it's about time you produce something<BR>new after all these years of shameless remixing!!! Do you<BR>remember at all the days when you were still creative,<BR>when you produced Taken By Force, Virgin Killer, In Trance,<BR>Fly To The Rainbow? You were truly great back then but not<BR>anymore.
6303271146|5.0|I loved this one it's my fav! in this Ryan loses his memory I won't tell you how. and Katileen and P.B have to look for him don't worry at the end he's okay and has his memory to boot.
B00003CXRP|3.0|This SUPER-PRODUCTION could have been far better if it hadn't been so upscale, so fraught with money-schemes and agents rushing about to hammer home every red cent they could conceivably attract.  As it turns out, I was disappointed when I walked out of the theater almost a year ago.  And I'm even more frustrated by this DVD.  All of the extra footage only seems to accentuate the paltriness of the movie - which is nothing much more than a committee-led travesty (something like your latest PTA meeting).  The premise was compelling _ what happens when a typically hide-bound technologist is stranded where none of his cocksure techniques matter?  The true drama of this story took place inside Chuck Nolan's head.  The film fails to give us even a fleeting glimpse of this man's intelligence working through the immense problems suddenly confronting it.
6304712936|5.0|In fact, looking back to the 18th century's history, it often has, but not in this case. W. A. Mozart died very young and wasn't fully and deservedly appreciated and hailed as one of the greatest geniuses in human history until after his death; there was a musician named Antonio Salieri at the Emperor's court, but his relationship with Mozart wasn't that close. And hey, he may seem a mediocre composer when compared to Mozart, but he's actually written some excellent operas and certainly deserves much more credit than he gets now. He totally changed the world of opera writting, especially after having written \\"Tarare\\" and \\"Falstaff\\", and was considered to have played a central role in the \\"new school of opera writting\\". And let's not forget that he gave music lessons to Beethowen and Liszt.<br /><br />  But what the heck? Had the script been different, F. Murray Abraham wouldn't have offered us his undisputably best performance ever and this movie would not have been the masterpiece that it is, although I consider it to be an artistical work rather than a biographical or a historical one, and as such it totally deserves all the Academy Awards it won that year: \\"Mediocrities everywhere, I absolve you all!\\"
0792835077|3.0|Yul Brynner will always be remembered as the robot gunslinger in Michael Crichton's WESTWORLD.  His performance is the only thing that saves this movie from the trash bin.  In fact, the last half hour is VERY creepy!!!  Brynner's performance is so good that I got nightmares for many years thereafter - I was chased through underground tunnels by Brynner's evil gunslinger. THE TERMINATOR AND TERMINATOR 2 are much better films. <br />Pros: Yul Brynner<BR>Cons: Everything else<br />SCORE: 60 (out of 100)
B00005NGSD|5.0|I am very suprised that this disc receives so little attention,<BR>especially in the US. Nevertheless, is one of the 4 early<BR>Scorpions albums that defined them as one of world's best heavy<BR>metal bands (the others are Virgin Killer, In Trance and Fly To The Rainbow). <br />This album features the best lineup Scorpions<BR>ever had, including Ulrich Roth and represents the true heavy<BR>metal Scorpions before they became the commercial pop-metal<BR>group they are today who produce new albums by recombining<BR>songs from their older ones...<br />Up until very recently, almost none of the 4 albums I mention<BR>were available in the US at any price except for their used<BR>version on ebay (that's how I bought this one). Now you can<BR>simply buy them on amazon and I recommend you do before they<BR>disappear again...<br />If you are a true metal fan and love Judas Priest, Helloween,<BR>Accept, Iron Maiden and the like, this album needs to be a part<BR>of your collection - you will never regret it! My personal<br />favorites are Streamrock Fever and The Sails Of Charon which<BR>I consider the best Scorpions song of all times.
B00005JKHP|4.0|For twenty years, many Star Trek fans have complained miserably about the starship Enterprise's first foray onto the silver screen. Criticized for being overly long, lacking the proper character chemistry seen on the TV series and emphasizing special effects over plot, Star Trek: The Motion Picture certainly was a mixed blessing for fans when it arrived in theatres in December 1979. It was the last of the truly visually spectacular science fiction films that captivated audiences in the late 70s (Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Superman: The Movie and Alien being the others). In hindsight, however, ST:TMP has been unfairly criticized. Considering the lack of compelling storytelling in most of the latter films and TV spinoffs, ST:TMP is the only Star Trek film that attempts to tell an epic-style story. Because of an insane filming schedule to accomodate theatre owners, director Robert Wise was never able to properly edit a satisfying cut of the film; the new director's edition rightfully cuts out a lot of extraneous material--unnecessary technobabble, crewmembers staring at the viewscreen for interminable periods of time, trying to look mesmerized--but doesn't lose the epic tone originally established in the 1979 release. The original character chemistries are intentionally lacking because these characters are facing awkward, internal conflicts: Spock's attempts to purge his human side and reconcile with it; Kirk's need to regain command of a starship he knows very little about. These characters' conflicts are part of the reason Shatner, Nimoy et al appear restrained in their performances. While the attempt to reach 2001-level profundity misses the mark, ST:TMP nevertheless resists a simple, action-oriented solution to the V'Ger threat, preferring a slower, cerebral approach. The newly added special effects don't distract from the film itself and improve several scenes (the wormhole explosion, the V'Ger site bridge) that weren't fully completed for theoriginal release. The Enterprise has never been shown as majestic as in this film and the beautiful Jerry Goldsmith score has also never been topped by another composer in another Trek film. Fans tend to appreciate the more episodic, formulaic entries in the Star Trek film series, but ST:TMP remains the cinematic marvel that established the desire for further films and TV series.
B0000508U6|5.0|It's impossible to pick a favorite song on this c.d. You think you like one song the best, then the next plays and takes you to a whole new world. The only problem with this c.d. is that when a song begins, your mind drifts off with it, and makes it hard to concentrate on the beautiful lyrics which add to the magnitism of the sound. Brilliantly done, well worth the money.<br />(P.s. this c.d. is great to pop in when stressed out, it works for me all the time.)

0790736918|4.0|I am a John Ford fan and tried very hard to like this movie, but the only thing holding it together is John Wayne.  The movie does have several strong points.  First of all, this is Wayne's BEST performance alongside RED RIVER (1948).  Wayne's antihero, Ethan Edwards, is by no means a character to idolize.  Even Wayne himself did not like the character, but Ford was convinced that Wayne was the only one who could do the job - Henry Fonda was not the right choice for the role. Also, Ward Bond is very likeable as Reverend Clayton.  Secondly, the cinematography is brilliant, which could almost be in the same league as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA (1962).  The scenes where Ethan and Martin Pawley search for Debbie in New Mexico territory is a prime example.  The sand dunes almost blow into your seat - almost perfectly in wide screen format.  A final strength is Max Steiner's score.  Nearly every scene has its share of high crescendos and low monotones.  Before Ethan's family is attacked, the score has an eerie feeling.  However, after Ethan returns home to find his family has been massacred, the score moves the audience to tears when they see his reaction.  <br />The film does have MANY flaws too.  First of all, the story behind Martin Pawley and Laurie Jorgenson is boring beyond belief.  Secondly, humor is NOT an antedote to this movie.  The story is a play on tragedy and should be treated as such.  Mose Harper is about as annoying as Jar Jar Binks.  There are also film editing problems.  For example, when Ethan and Martin are in Scar's teepee, the very same Comanches across the way can be seen wandering twice.  Historically, it is nice to view Monument Valley, but not when the story begins in Texas.  Also, Ford should have reviewed his historical records on Comanches - he could have learned a few things.  There are other tid bits, too. The war chief, Scar, even has body paint and Natalie Wood looks too gorgeous to be a Comanche captive - I didn't know that captives had makeup.Even the dead Comanche under the grave marker is breathing!!  All in all, Wayne should be given credit where credit is due - he did know how to act, and this movie is the pinnacle of his long career.  For a MORE superior Ford western, there is STAGECOACH (1939).<br />Pros: John Wayne, Ward Bond, cinematography, score<BR>Cons: Film editing, story, characters, direction<br />SCORE: 78 (out of 100).
B00005QDW5|5.0|From the opening notes of &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; to the weird laughing on &quot;Bike&quot;, you know that you are on a music journey that only Pink Floyd could provide. This is a continuous project, meaning that the music doesn't stop except for when you have to change the disc.<br />For the fans of the Syd Barrett=era Pink Floyd, you won't be disappointed! Pink Floyd's first two hit songs, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;, were composed by Syd Barrett and feature him on lead vocals. &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; is a truly psychedelic song featuring Barrett and Richard Wright on lead vocals. &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; is the last song Barrett recorded with Pink Floyd before David Gilmour joined. And &quot;Bike&quot; has a certain whimsical flavor that only Barrett could provide.<br />There is one song featuring a five-member Pink Floyd (Barrett, Gilmour, Wright, Roger Waters, and Nick Mason). The song is &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;. This song was a concert staple of Pink Floyd until the early 1970s. Only Roger Waters has performed this song in concert since the early 1970s (during his 1984-85 Pros &amp; Cons Of Hitchhiking tour, his 1987 Radio KAOS tour, and his recent 1999-2001 In The Flesh tour).<br />All the tracks sound great. Although the song &quot;Echoes&quot; is slightly edited, I think it still sounds great and that the edit was done quite nicely. The only song that I feel did not belong on this CD is &quot;Marooned&quot;...if you're going to put a song on a CD, put the whole song on there, not an excerpt.<br />This CD also includes the extremely rare song &quot;When The Tigers Broke Free&quot; (this song was released as a limited-edition single in 1982 with the movie version of &quot;Bring The Boys Back Home&quot; on the opposite side). This is more than a worthy addition to this collection...it is almost worth the cost of the CD.<br />Of course, what Pink Floyd collection would be complete without &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Us And Them&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, and &quot;Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2)&quot;? I enjoy all the songs on this collection...my faves are &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;SOYCD&quot;, &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; (Clare Torrey has an AMAZING voice), &quot;Keep Talking&quot; (Gilmour shines on the talkbox), &quot;Sorrow&quot; (my favorite non-Waters PF song), &quot;One Of These Days&quot; (the only released song featuring Nick Mason on vocals), &quot;Set The Controls...&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; (one of the best guitar solos in history), and &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; (Syd RULES!).
6305971153|5.0|I was so excited to get this DVD for Christmas last year.  I saw this movie for the first time when I was 9 years old at the movie theatre in 1985 when I went for one my friend's birthday parties.  It was so great because it keeps you believing in the spirit of Christmas and Santa Claus, and the transition between the different centuries to modern times was very neat!  I remember as a little girl I loved Cornelia and Joe's characters getting to meet Santa too.  I owned a VHS copy of this, but when the DVD version came out, I was so excited to see the behind the scenes footage as an addition!   I am 25 years old now, and I still love watching this movie every Christmas! I wish more movies could be like this today.
B00005QG9J|1.0|Well here's what I think of the album.... It's a sorry excuse for any of Incubus' work. And to the guy saying that Incubus changed mainstream. Heck no. I still talk to people everyday that have no idea who Incubus is. And when they do they usually just know one or two songs. Yes there is a few Incubus circles around, and thats probably how they'll stay. I could best compare it to the Insane Clown Posse. You have your fanatical listeners that live and breath it then everyone else will listen to it when they are forced to by those &quot;fanatics&quot;.Thats it.

B00005QHPQ|5.0|Well, no true fan could say anything bad about his favorite artist and I'm no different. I love Enrique Iglesias and his music sounds perfect to me. It was very interesting to hear &quot;Escape&quot; because it really differes from &quot;Enrique&quot; and others. And, I think, it's great! &quot;Hero&quot; is still making me tremble every time I hear it, and songs like &quot;She be the one&quot; and &quot;Escape&quot; are almost driving me crazy. So, if you're a fan of Enrique Iglesias, or if you're searching for some music to lift you up, then you must listen to &quot;Escape&quot;. Believe me, it's amazing!
0743216458|4.0|In the book Band of Brothers by Stephen E. Ambrose setting, indirect characterization and suspense are greatly illustrated.  The book takes place between July of 1942 and right through1945, the end of World War two.  Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment 101st Airborne Division were a group of diverse young American men that came together on that summer of 1942 at Camp Toccoa, Georgia. As they trained vigorously for their first mission in England they had many challenges.  As they have occupied England and headed to Normandy France for D-Day suspense is shown particularly well at this point. As the Easy Company prepared for their jump on June 6, 1944 all things were going well until their initial drop site was missed and all plans failed.  Many men lost much of their important equipment some being theirs guns and knifes.  The suspense was tremendous while I had a feeling of great uncertainty of what was going to happen next.  Later easy company regrouped along with another company on Utah beach while some Easy Company troops were still lost in Normandy. After Normandy on D-Day, to the liberation of Holland, to holding the lines in the Battle of the Bulge, and in the end capturing Hitler's mountaintop retreat, Eagles Nest, in Bavaria all these men came together like brothers do. Through all the hard ships they faced in war this group of men had difficulties finding who they were.  The author showing indirect characterization by letting the soldiers show who they are and let us, the readers find who they are through commitment during training at Camp Toccoa and Courage, strength and fast intelligent thinking during the drop over Normandy on D-Day. Through it all, each veteran of the Easy Company division recalls that his reliance on his brothers-in-arms is the reason any of them made it back alive.

0380002930|5.0|I first saw the cartoon movie when I was only 10. I was so enthralled with the imagery that was in the movie that I checked the book out of the school library the very next day. I remeber that it was a hard back book with a map of the fields inside the cover. It took me all of one week to read the entire book. My teacher thought I should have read a shorter book to do my report on as the book was so long. I received an A+ as I usually did on my reports. I highly recommend this book for kids, and adults. It is one of my favorite all time books.<br />The imagery that you get from the book is so much more than the movie tried to provide. The book deals with the society of a warren of rabbits. How they deal with each other, leadership, their culture and their journey on finding a place to call home.
0440219078|5.0|Of the many literary devices employed in Lois Lowry's The Giver, the three that are best displayed are the rising action, climax, and resolution.  Although some might say that these areas lack in the novel, it it this lack of explanation of these particular literary devices that makes them so brilliant.<br />The rising action of the book is incredibly exciting.  The reader is not sure what is in store for Jonas on his journey.  The action is most suspenseful when Jonas is leaving the &quot;utopian&quot; society he has lived in all of his life.  As Jonas makes his journey in order to restore the memories of the townspeople, the rising action comes to its highest point.  The climax of the story is when Jonas' memories are starting to slip away.  This is a great climax because it gives the reader a sense of insecurity and wonder about the coming events.  After the climax has ended, the author provides the reader with a resolution that does not really resolve anything.  This is because he does not conclude the story in any way, but leaves it hanging for the reader to decide in his/her mind what had happened.  The author does not force an opinion on you, but instead lets the reader make an important decision about the resolution.  Although the author does lead you in a particular direction about what has happened, it is up to the reader to make out the details, and this is why the literary device is used so well.  Without the wonderful use of these three devices, this story would not have as great an impact on the reader.

0441172717|4.0|I'll be the first person to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of science fiction, but Dune is a classic.  After watching the original Dune movie, I felt that reading the book might be able to fill in some parts that I thought would be clearer and better explained in the book, and it did.  Dune may be science fiction, but I felt that it was easier to read than other sci-fi books I've read. It didn't have the long sections of confusing (to me anyway) explanations of scientific principles and electronic equipment.  Also, with the abilities of the Bene Gesserit, the book takes on some of the feel of a fantasy novel.  Dune is based on a desert planet called Arrakis, where a substance simply referred to as spice is mined.  The book starts with Paul Atreides growing into his role as the Muad'dib.  After his family is betrayed by a friend of the family, through the plots of the House Harkonnen.  Although the political intrigue was, at time, beyond me, the adventure of the story pulled me in.  The first in an ongoing series, Dune is a classic in the science-fictions genre.
0140042520|5.0|Yes, &quot;On The Road&quot; gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. &quot;Dharma Bums&quot; soars as high as &quot;Big Sur&quot; dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors.
0812550706|4.0|The first book of the Ender's Saga, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is brilliantly written and will keep you reading page after page without any though of stopping for a break.<br />Andrew Wiggin, known to everyone just as Ender, at the age of six is asked to leave his family on the planet earth to journey to the Belt. Ender is a child prodigy and there is a reason the government want to send him to Battle School at the Belt. Humanity is under the constant threat from an alien race called the Buggers. No one seems to know anything about them but people on earth believe that after being defeated long time ago, the Buggers will try again to attack the humans. The people are ready, they have the troops, the weapons, the technology, but they still don't have one very important thing, they don't have a commander to lead them. And their only hope rests on young Ender's. From the moment he reaches Battle School, his life is strictly disciplined by mind games, isolation, patience, computers, and mock battles. As the invasion draws closer and closer and Ender must be pushed to his limits. Will Ender be able to endure the pressure?<br />Full of surprises, twists and turns, &quot;Ender's Game&quot; is for all science fiction lovers. Very realistic and fun to read. The ending will really shock you... I was!! My favorite parts are probably all the mock-battles and the very end. The only problem I have in this book, the reason for only 4 stars, is because of the language. But except for that I would have given this book 5 stars and I recommend this book for older kids and adults who can handle it and some of the violence. The other books of the Ender's Saga is &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, &quot;Xenocide&quot;, &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;, &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot;, and &quot;Shadow of Hegemon&quot;.

B00003CXE7|1.0|This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called \\"historical\\" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest).
B00005MP58|5.0|Seven stars for artistic content, MINUS ONE for technology: Average = 3. [UPDATE: Now five stars after technology has been addressed quite superbly.]  Avoid this ghastly \\"Special Edition!\\"  Pay the extra bucks for the older DVD edition (if you still can).  Accept the lesser of the technological evils, because . . .<br /><br />You MUST own this P&P.  In some form.  With whatever technical flaws.  You can't afford to rent it as often as you'll want to watch it.  You must own it.  You must.<br /><br />It correctly decides to be faithful to this perhaps best of all novels, except where necessary to adapt to video.  We must learn that \\"A young man of large fortune must be in want of a wife,\\" or it wouldn't be P&P, would it?  Austen just wrote the words, but on video, somebody must SAY them.  The book just lets us read letters, but the video must have people read aloud or visit instead of writing, as when Mr. Collins comes to \\"condole.\\"  I do not object to the few departures from the book, except to wish for ALL of the dialogue when Elizabeth teaches Lady Catherine that everyone in the family is not so obsequious as Mr Collins.<br /><br />The acting (so many star performances, no player less than superb), the direction, the costumes, the settings, the music? Simply the best; nobody ever did a better ARTISTIC job of anything on video. Ehle and Firth deserve all the praise by other reviewers.  (Watching Ehle play Elizabeth is like watching a movie of my mother at that age.  Could two women like that really be born?  Trivia freaks: who's EHLE's mom?) )  Benjamin Withrow is perfect as Mr. Bennet - none could be better.  However, I most admire the performances of Steadman as Mrs. Bennet, Bamber as Mr. Collins, and Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine.  Priceless!  It was surely not easy for Firth to make us believe that dearest, loveliest Elizabeth has moderated Darcy's pride (just today came an email came saying that women think they can change the men they love, and men think women won't change, and that both are wrong).  However, Steadman, Bamber, and Leigh-Hunt have the far more difficult task of being taken seriously as fools (along the host of Lucas and Bingley fools in smaller roles).  They aren't allowed the fun that Sawalha has in her perfect (except for not being the tallest sister, as in the book, hardly her fault) portrayal of the wild thoughtless ditzy Lydia. I'm sorry not to have space to praise all other players in large roles and small (would Susannah Harker be interested in an older man? . . . sigh . . .).<br /><br />HOWEVER . . . ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY . . .<br /><br />After wearing out one VHS set, almost wearing out another, then being disappointed that the first DVD was no better, I really looked forward to this \\"digitally remastered\\" edition. At last, the orange cast would be gone, and the murky fuzziness would give way to the crystalline images we expect from DVD's of stuff shot in the mid-90's. I should have wondered why the special edition was (...) cheaper than the earlier DVD.  The orange cast is indeed gone -- everything's turquoise now. I'll leave the candle-lit scenes to your imagination. The images are indeed more contrasty - everything lighter than medium gray is fried to a cheesy bluish-white, all shadow detail blends into stygian sameness. What a horrid horrid thing to do to all those lovely juicy blushing young actresses! It looks like A&E, just for this project, brought in the kid who got the worst grades in digital video class at some backwater community college, and didn't check out his finished product.  At least he appears to have learned a few things as he went along, because the first disk is the worst.  Is this really from the same people who did those lovely DVD editions of \\"Lillie\\" and \\"I Claudius,\\" both shot a quarter-century ago? Even if the source were limited to the older DVD edition, just about ANYbody could have remastered it better.<br /><br />Oh well. I think I'll just fix one frame at a time (from the original DVD edition) on my computer with Adobe Photoshop, then play it from my hard drive when I'm finished in time for the 200th anniversary of JA's death. I've given up on waiting for A&E to fix it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well, it finally DID get fixed -- and how.  If anyone is still reading this, the new version remastered from the original negative is technically flawless, removing all issues discussed above.  I have bought it on Blu-ray, where it comes as close to artistic and technological perfection as even the finickiest viewer has any right to expect.<br /><br />PS - Anybody who thinks this is a \\"chick flick\\" just doesn't understand Jane Austen, who like Elizabeth Bennet and her father, considers human weaknesses to be the ultimate entertainment.  Austen often makes her thrust with the last word(s) in a sentence or paragraph that may have started innocuously enough.  That last word shoves in the dagger and twists it.  Ehle gets my favorite line in P&P - \\"There are few people I love, and even fewer of whom I think well.\\"  Or is it her dad's \\"For what do we live, except to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?\\"  Anybody who dismisses Austen as a frothy romance novelist just can't read.rom the original DVD edition) on my computer with Adobe Photoshop, then play it from my hard drive when I'm finished in time for the 200th anniversary of JA's death.

B00003CXFG|5.0|PITCH BLACK is an incredible movie. Lots of suspense. Richard B. Riddick is very intriguing to figure out. Very intense characters. The added footage on the unrated version really explains and adds a lot to some of the scenes of the movie that you see in the rated version. As David Twohy says, &quot;Sometimes the less you see is scarier.&quot; Not knowing what's out there makes it a lot more bone chilling. I highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone. Especially fans of Vin Diesel(like me)! Would I be afraid of the dark?----not if I was with Riddick(in which case, he might need to be afraid of the dark!!!) Keep up the great work, Vin! Can't wait for the sequel!!!!

B00005ALRO|5.0|The Fugitive is a fantastic film. I'm just going to come right out and say that first. It's perfect. It can't be any better than it is. Director Andrew Davis(Under Siege)delivers a high octane action/adventure film that's a great ride from scene one to the end climax. Harrison Ford stars as Dr. Richard Kimble. He's an innocent man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife(Sela Ward). While being transported, the jail van gets in an accident and the good doctor escapes. He's now on the lam trying to find the real killer and to clear his name. Tommy Lee Jones is an F.B.I. marshall after Ford. Jones won the Supporting Oscar for this. He's teriffic. Ford is his usual solid, perfect self. If he isn't the blueprint for the perfect matinee idol, then I don't know who is. This movie holds you from the beginning and never lets go. Julianne Moore pops up in a very brief role. Don't even bother with the sequel &quot;F.B.I. Marshalls&quot;. This is one great classic. A must!.
B000001EXR|4.0|Este disco no tiene nada que ver con el Kiss tipico, con un sonido muy grounch y muy pesado.  El ultimo disco con el &quot;lineup de los 90&quot;.  De entrada aparece &quot;Hate&quot; de Gene Simmons, muy rockera y pesada, y ya nos damos cuenta que el Cd tiene algo diferente que ofrecer.  Seguidamente &quot;Rain&quot; y &quot;Master And Slave&quot; de Paul Stanley muy distinto a lo que noes tenia acostumbrado. Tambin esta la balada &quot;I will be there&quot;, nada melosa, muy buena.  La cancin que mas se asemeja al Kiss, es &quot;In the Mirror&quot; (de mis favoritas).

B00000DHRX|5.0|In the 80's, George Michael was on top of the world. As a part of Wham!, he achieved monster success. On his own, he started of earn even greater joy. But in the 1990's, his popularity fizzled to his departure from the public eye.<br />Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, is an spectacular anthology from George Michael. There were even more songs than I thought it would be. The songs remain as catchy and dynamic as ever. Outside, to me I think of that hilarious video George poked fun at his &quot;John&quot; scenario. A Different Corner, expresses loss and lingering for love and happiness when your feel betrayed by your love.<br />The other songs blend in seperately on two CD's. One for ballads, the other for Dance. From Jesus To A Child, to One More Try. George Michael became even the better performer than the music industry predicted. He still brings out an little faith to everyone.
B000002BMV|5.0|Some friends of mine have never understood my fascination with music or the hundreds of CD's, LP's, and cassettes I have collected over the years. When I explain to them 'why', I tell<BR>them by explaining the tears that suddenly appear in my eyes when<BR>I listen to &quot;Mother,Father&quot; off of this incredible album.<br />Critical acclaim has been very rare for Journey and after listening to this album, one would wonder why critics have such<BR>a 'high regard' in the music world. From the sweeping grandeur of<BR>&quot;Don't Stop Believin&quot;, I was transported into this album as a teenager. Steve Perry's voice reflects the sorrow and joy that he has encountered in his own life, and the prestige of a recording remains one that allows you to feel the inspiration of the artists. Neil Schon and Jonathan Cain, as always, are true to their craft: Neil's guitar work shines throughout complemented<BR>by Jonathan's soaring and subtle keyboards.<br />Forget everything you have heard or have known about this band.<BR>Listen to the agonizing soul expressed in &quot;Still They Ride&quot;, the rebellious spirit exploding from &quot;Escape&quot;, or the carefree memories of our youth from &quot;Stone In Love&quot;. If you still find no inner connection, let &quot;Mother,Father&quot; roam loudly through your speakers in a darkened, candlelit room...<br />Critics?

B00003CXTG|1.0|I feel embarrased because I actually thought that action schlock director Michael Bay might actually do something good with this film. The only thing he did was bore viewers senseless and embarras the heroes of Pearl Harbor with this overblown turkey bomb. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett are okay, but you really don't care for them or their characters. The romance is so flimsily written and acted, you almost feel sorry for the actors involved. Brilliant cinematic gems like &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot; have nothing to worry about. The dialogue is so juvenile and cliche. You almost cringe sometimes. The action is good, but the effects aren't all that great either. The only decent thing about this joke is Jon Voight's performance, and the loveliness of Kate Beckinsale. The filmmakers tried so hard for a monumental film, but they didn't know how to go about doing it. The people who rave this film have, obviously, been fooled horribly. When the credits roll, you'll let out a huge sigh of relief. If you want real majestic beauty and emotion, go re-watch both of the movies I mentioned above. They are the ones who got it right. This was the biggest disappointment of the year hands down.
B000001EKX|4.0|Lamentablemente uno de los discos mas subvaluados de Kiss, cosas de la critica, a veces inentendibles.  El disco no es que sea una maravilla, pero con bastante buen material: &quot;Got to choose&quot; incluida en el MTV (importando) y en Alive, &quot;Watching You&quot; de Gene Simmons, de lo mas pesado del disco (incluida tanto en el Alive I como en el III), &quot;Let Me go Rock and Roll&quot; mi favorita, un Rock and Roll muy pesado, corta en duracin pero te encantar.  No te des mala vida con la critica especializada, compra este disco.-
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Movies are not usually on my want list...but ever since I saw the ads for this one, I've wanted it. Made my husband go right out and buy it. I don't think Hollywood or Disney realize how difficult it is for us deaf people to lipread cartoon characters! Though the animation is far beyond what was seen five years ago, normally it would not be enough to carry the story. What makes it all the more valuable is the original story and the voices and personalities of the characters. It is amazing how much personality the graphic artists can give these computer characters. I know I cannot hear the voices and tones, but I certainly got the humor and recognized the artists behind the voices (through the drawings and through the attitudes of the characters).<br />the story is sweet and poignant, and is essential viewing for children because of the concepts it teaches. However, the humor is way beyond most children. The writing is definitely geared toward adults, though my granddaughter at three was mesmerized for the entire length of the film! My husband and I were laughing so hard...tears were falling. <br />This will definitely be a family favorite. It serves to remind us that it is what inside that counts, not the surface beauty which too often the world puts such importance on. Kudos to everyone involved. <BR>Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh
B000000OMB|5.0|1982 probably doesn't mean too much to many people. For me, it was the beginning of my initiation into progressive rock. A year earlier, you could have mentioned the names 'John Wetton','Steve<BR>Howe','Geoffrey Downes', or 'Carl Palmer', and I would have shrugged my shoulders and said 'So what'. When I discovered the<BR>Asia cassette in my brother's room and played it for myself, a<BR>new world was opened to me, and these names (although garnering<BR>years of respect before in their previous bands) began to mean<BR>something, achieving my respect.<br />From the opening track of &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot;, you become a<BR>listener of a true progressive band. Their sound is nothing but<BR>unique and at times, haunting as is expressed in &quot;Without You.&quot;<BR>Geoffrey's keyboards never really dominate these pieces of music <BR>but sound triumphantly and clearly with John Wetton's impassioned vocals. It is very hard to believe that in all of this 'soundscape', one can recognize the classically tinted guitar expressions of Steve Howe and the subtle bass of Wetton.<BR>And Carl Palmer..a frantic but driven display of drum-playing.<br />All of these elements combine and the results are nothing short of incredible magic. 'Sole Survivor' portrays a spirit to continue our daily battle, while 'Wildest Dreams' brings on the <BR>cruel reality that surrounds us (by far two of my favorite tracks on the album). I was also attracted to 'Cutting It Fine'<BR>as it includes one of the most beautiful piano pieces I have ever heard.<br />It's hard to imagine how such talent was brought together and created a sound that could not be duplicated, and a sound that was aggressive, melancholy, and heartfelt all in one experience.<BR>(Roger Dean's amazing cover was also one that is clearly recognizable in any record store, making the purchase worth much more than it usually sells for now.)<br />I'll remember 1982..it connected me with four musicians who still<BR>direct my attention totheir works produced today. The Asia album will always remind me of how influential and powerful a piece of music can remain and withstand time...
B00005OM4N|1.0|This is album was horrible. To be Jive would be completely embaressing. Not only does the album have one song (I'm A Slave 4 U) as the only song worth buying the album for, but it completly lacks the same Britney success she had two albums before.<BR>I am completely sadened with this album and the content, though it is clear Britney would do better as an Rock&amp;Roll artist or at least Alternative. However, she looks to be heading down the path of former teen-sensations/pop-princesses, Tiffany and Debbie Gibson (Where are they now? My point exactly!).<BR>I can fortell the future for Spears' and that is the next album being her Greatest Hits! At least we will be able to hear the old material that was traditional and enjoyable instead of the disgraceful material found on &quot;Britney&quot;. Overall, Mandy Moore's self-titled album is a way better choice for purchase!
0671027573|5.0|I loved this book!  I read the proloque and that was it; I could not put it down.  The pairing of Jaine Bright and Sam Donovan is so good and a laugh a minute then add the mystery to it and you've got a great read!  This was my first book by Linda Howard and won't be my last.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Very painful to listen to. Britney is a plastic corporate dupe. Her sound has matured?... well maybe for a 7 year old to an 8 year old. Britney Spears is the Johnny Bravo of our time. Britney Spears is to music like food is to McDonalds, many people eat it, and it is incredibly popular<BR>with the masses (especially the kiddies), but does that mean that it is good?<br />I see no growth in Britney, which is sad. Most of the CD had that cut &quot;boy band&quot; sound. Britney would do well to study some great female songwriters such as: Sheryl Crow, Shawn Colvin, Joni Mitchell, and Jonatha Brooke to name a few. Britney right now has about 1/1500th of their talent and songwriting skill.
B000002B7U|5.0|This 1986 release from Metal God Ozzy Osbourne was in my opinion one of the best of the 80's and definitely Ozzy's best.  What make this CD so great is the combo of Osbourne's unique voice, signiture vocal style and Guitar Legend Jake E Lee's crunchy, hard hitting riffs and shattering solos.  This was a hard rock CD for the ages.  These songs are so catchy, but at the same time have so much meaning to them (read the lyrics which are included with the CD).  Osbourne who is best know for his over the top theatrics and bad boy rep can write as good as anyone in the business and in most cases even better.  This CD is proof of it.  As much as I respect Randy Rhoads and loved the work he and Ozzy did together on the first two CD's I enjoy this CD more than Blizzard and Diary.  I just like Jake E Lee and his style and sound a bit better.  To me Jake is just as great as Randy was.  Lee has done so many things in his career and worked with so many other artists, the rad guitar work he does on this CD is by far his finest hour.  Shot in the Dark, Ultimate Sin, Secret Loser, Lightning Strikes, Fool Like you, Killer of Giants... this is one of those CD's that you'll love every song on.  I would recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys Ozzy, hard rock, pop metal, and a MUST for any Jake E Lee fan, if you have &quot;A Fine Pink Mist&quot; by Jake this is a MUST MUST MUST have CD as well as &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;.  If you Love this CD as much as I did another must have is Dokken's 1987 release &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; Don Dokken and George Lynch are another outrageous Vocal/Guitar duo.  Believe me they are just as flawless as Ozzy and Jake.  Hope this helps you. In other words buy it, you'll be glad you did it and you won't have that disappointed feeling like you do when you spend 13 or 14 bucks on a CD with just one or two good songs on it.  Almost every song on all the CD's I talked about above are GREAT!!!
B00005JKOV|4.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; completes (continues?) the walking-and-talking trilogy Richard Linklater started with &quot;Slackers&quot; and took up again with &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;.  It owes much to the form and content of those previous movies, borrowing &quot;Slackers&quot;s disjointed structure and &quot;Before Sunrise&quot;s unabashed romanticism.  Only this time it's not a romance between a man and a woman, but between one man's sleeping and waking life.<br />For me, initially, this was a tough film to engage with.  The first third was terribly boring to sit through; at times it was a tough fight to keep my drooping eyes from closing for good.  The friend I saw it with wasn't as lucky, for I caught her napping early on (she later admitted that the nap I saw was actually her third, and this was during the film's first half hour!).  Frankly, this sleepiness should be expected, for the first &quot;act&quot; consists entirely of Wiley Wiggins encountering various random, verbose individuals, whom all ramble on about their great philosophical theories.  Combine the droning nature of the dialogue, the very liquid backgrounds (the animation was beautiful, true, but very hypnotic; like watching the ocean on a breezy day), and a meandering anti-narrative, and you get a sleep inducing movie.<br />This first third was like listening to someone's long, boring dream, an observation that Linklater, appearing near the end as himself, actually cops to.  Kudos to him for admitting the inherent flaw in his movie (This flaw is also alluded to when Steven Soderbergh, in a brief cameo, tells an anecdote about how Billy Wilder described Louis Malle's upcoming $2.5 million dream-within-a-dream movie as a &quot;$2.5 million loss&quot;).  However, even though the film is preachy, pretentious, long-winded, and droning at times, I give Linklater credit for including such off-beat discussion in his relatively mainstream movie.<br />The movie takes a drastic turn around halfway through, when Wiggins' character experiences dream lucidity in a &quot;Holy Moment&quot;.  I'll not spoil how, for it was, for me, the most exhilarating moment of the movie.  Needless to say, from this point on he is no longer a passive listener, but is allowed to engage the people he meets in thought provoking discussion. It picks up some much needed energy from this moment.  The movie changes from being a series of boring lectures (reminded me of school!) to a series of fascinating social discourses (in one of the scenes that doesn't involve Wiggins, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy seemingly revive their &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; roles, going so far as to quote their prior selves regarding a discussion they had in that movie about the division of the soul as the world's population increases -- it's much more fascinating than the way I describe it here, trust me).<br />The animation is impressive and necessary for the kind of movie this is (in an interview, Linklater admitted that if live-action characters spoke his trippy dialogue, the audience would be hard-pressed to believe; the animation allows him to go off on tangents, work through absurd trains of thought, and generally make as much or as little sense as he wanted, just as a real dream would).  The visuals do take a while to get used to, though.  In the beginning I found myself noticing the technique more than paying attention to the dialogue.  If you let yourself, the minutiae that the artists include in the background can be quite engrossing.  That being said, with a new toy like this a lot more could have been done, which would have been distracting.  Linklater reins in his animators with a fine sense of restraint, not allowing them to go wild and fully exploit the animation to any extreme, but only go far enough to show a glimpse of its magnificent possibilities.  I was grateful for this.<br />&quot;Waking Life&quot; is a unique movie-going experience, at least for me.  I left the theatre confused, disoriented, and mildly disappointed.  It is only after 12 hours of reflection that I realize the particular genius here.  I can't stop thinking about what it all means, and am truly glad that I saw the film.
0385505833|5.0|I read this book in about two hours and  I loved it. It was endearing and funny. I laughed out loud something I haven't done with a book in  a long time. The best part about it was that you could imagine the whole thing actually happening. Great book highly recommended.
0345448898|2.0|I absolutely love fantasy (usually) but was incredibly let down by this series. The first book was wonderful. I immediately bought the next two- and hated them. I love reading about other worlds, and the daemon idea is great, but I didn't like that some characters died (main ones) and others crossed over in my world (drinking coke, riding in cars, etc.) And the first book paid a lot of attention to character development, while the next two were incredibly rushed and hurried feeling, with confusing, badly-laid out, not-well-described worlds and religious theories. Plus, after the first one, the humor just disappears. Just goes away entirely. I read this series, and the reviews of it, with great excitement, but I was completely uninspired by it. If you like fantasy, other worlds, young children going toward their destinies, and, for god's sake, good character development and humor, buy something by David Eddings. (...)

0441172717|3.0|Truly one of the classics of contemporary Science Fiction, Dune set a standard for science fiction that few have yet to meet.  Mixing the distant, distant future with the politics and culture of the medieval age, Herbert is one of the few Sci Fi authors that have not only a visionary outlook, but also a fine grasp of past history.  A mutli-layered, complex book, with many different plots, schemes, and treacheries, running through it and intertwining, Dune is a book that can be read and read and still enjoyed.  The made-up vocabulary of this fictional universe is a treat to read, in many places the words roll of the pages almost as poetry.  Written in the 70's, it is easy to see the author influenced by OPEC and the energy crisis and the Iranian Islamic revolution. The mystical, dark and brooding atmosphere of Machiavellian intrigue will make any reader reflect on the ugly nature of power.<br />It is the politics of the author that is the most objectionable part of the novel.  The book is full of totalitarian political philosophy, worthy of any Nazi or Stalinist.  The author obviously does not put much value in individual freedom or even human life.  Characters are dispatched with cold cynicism all throughout the book without much reflection on the morality of murder.  This sentiment seems to grow in later installments of the Dune series.  Readers should not confuse the profound political musings of Herbert as an endorsement for the absolute power held by a god-emperor like Paul Attreides.
B000002I8D|5.0|Although I don't own the album persay, I have to say In the Air Tonight is one of the best pieces of music ever written. I have written a short story about one of the urban legends behind it, I've karaoked it, I've made my own music video about it,it's a powerful and moving song. It's inspired me to take up the drums if I ever find the time. This song is truely more than a song. It is a heartfelt,flat-out, powerful, moving, drum and guitar life force.  I don't know. In any case, In the Air Tonight is one of the best songs ever. It is on the field of Knights in White Satin, Abbey Road, Bat Out of Hell, Sergeant Pepper, and all that good old rock.
B00001ODGR|5.0|I RECENTLY VIEWED MY COPY OF &quot;RETURN TO PARADISE&quot; AND ONE WORD COMES TO MIND.......&quot;AWESOME!&quot;  IT'S LIKE YOUR AT THE CONCERT WITH THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE.  I'VE SEEN STYX SEVERAL TIMES IN CONCERT AND THIS DVD BRINGS BACK A LOT OF REALLY GOOD MEMORIES.  THE ONLY THING IN MY OPINION THAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CONCERT IS THAT IT DIDN'T INCLUDE &quot;DEAR JOHN&quot; FROM THE CD VERSION OF THE CONCERT.  OH WELL, I GUESS YOU CAN'T HAVE EVERYTHING.  IT'S STILL AN AWESOME SHOW, DON'T MISS IT.
B00005Q79B|3.0|We are obviously getting near the end of the road here because Volume 37 of the Star Trek DVD series offers up a couple of lesser efforts from the show's final season. &quot;The Lights of Zetar&quot; is heading for Memory Alpha, which must be the Federation's version of Asimov's Foundation facility, when an energy cloud appears. After knocking out Lt. Mira Romaine on the ship, the cloud attacks Memory Alpha, kills most of the researchers and wipes out the computer memory. When the Enterprise encounters the cloud again, it is clear that there is some weird link between it and Romaine. Eventually Kirk gets around to exploiting it in order to figure out what is going on and what to do about it. This is one of those Star Trek episodes that just strikes me as rather lame. The explanation is unsatisfying and the resolution is a bit extreme on several levels. Besides which, I do not think energy clouds are this easy to defeat.<br />&quot;The Cloud Minders&quot; finds the Enterprise visiting Ardana, a planet rich in the mineral zenite and where the society is divided into those who live on Stratos, a city in the cloud where everyone engages in the mental arts, and the Troglytes, who work in the zenite minds. As Kirk tries to negotiate for the zenite, the Troglytes have started to rebel. Plasus, the head of the Stratos Council, starts torturing Troglytes, with little success. Kirk meets with Vanna, the leader of the Troglytes and offers help: it seems the zenite gas causes &quot;temporary&quot; mental and emotional problems and McCoy has whipped up some masks that improve the health of the miners. Of course, Vanna does not trust the strange visitors from another planet and the people of Stratos do not want to give up their belief of superiority over the Troglytes. This leaves it all up to Kirk to show them all the error of their ways. Since there is a planet that needs that zenite I guess playing around with the Prime Directive is okay (this time). &quot;The Cloud Minders&quot; is the better of the two episodes on this DVD, but we have seen much better examples of Kirk bringing enlightenment to supposedly advanced but obviously bigoted societies.ot; is the better of the two episodes on this DVD, but we have seen much better examples of Kirk bringing enlightenment to supposedly advanced but obviously bigoted societies.
B00005R23S|5.0|What a joy in this age of homogenized and computerized music to be able to see something with genuine soul and enjoyment. The E Steet Band never sounded better. Having been to a few Bruce concerts over the years, the last tour was without a doubt the best, and this DVD captures it all. When you see how much fun the band is having, you have no choice but to &quot;go along for the ride&quot;. As said by the Boss, &quot;I cannot promise you life everlasting, but I can promise you life right now&quot;.Say amen somebody.
B00003CXWV|4.0|\\"Blow\\" is a very good biopic on the life of cocaine kingpin George Jung (Johnny Depp) who rose to prominence in the 1980's as one of the largest cocaine traffickers in the United States.  The story is an interesting character study of Jung, who started selling marijuana to pay some bills and found that demand continued to outpace his ability to supply until he had built a cocaine empire.<br />In an interview from prison included on the DVD, Jung states that the story was very true to actual events and that in certain cases it was like a flashback.  Jung appears from this interview to be a hapless soul who was willingly swept along by a riptide of forces that were beyond his sway, which is exactly how Depp portrayed him.<br />Johnny Depp is an excellent character actor who relishes playing odd and offbeat characters.  In this film he gives one of his best and most nuanced performances with a clear understanding of the motivations and circumstances that spun Jung out of control.  He plays Jung with naiveté rather than giving him the sinister character that one might expect from a drug lord.   After having seen the interview with the real Jung it seems Depp was right on target.<br />Penelope Cruz also expands her horizons, shedding her normally sweet persona to take on the part of Jung's shrewish, drug addicted wife.  Cruz plays the part with great force and emotion, like a woman possessed.  It is a fantastic portrayal of a bitter, self centered woman with a drug problem.<br />Paul Reubens continues his comeback from the ill fated Pee-wee Herman days with a solid portrayal of Derek, the double dealing hair dresser who becomes Jung's primary distributor.  Rachel Griffiths and Ray Liotta also give fine performances as Jung's clueless parents.<br />This character study is well written and sympathetically presented by director Ted Demme.  I rated it an 8/10.  It contains standout performances by both Depp and Cruz and is well worth seeing.
6303314015|5.0|I watched The Lion King last night and enjoyed it. But I have not seen this film getting played on tv. Even on abc who played Toy Story and Toy Story 2. Which I say this is better, because instead of toys, this are wild animals in this movie. Which goes from a warthog named Pumbaa and a meerkat named Timon to lions. As The Lion King opens, yong Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas from Tv's Home Impovement) is born to Mufasa (James Earl Jones from Field of Dreams) and Sarabi (Madge Sinclair). Simba's mother is absent though most of the movie. (...) Watch this instead of Toy Story 2.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Ms. Spears does it again, this time in a more mature , more &quot;hey I can sing , don't give lip&quot; way,she really knew what she was doing with this one. She IS facing with everybody talking about her, superstardom ,and stuff! Like 5 of the 13 songs on the record are written by her! She has pop, hip-hop, r&amp;b, and rock, all summed to one into this amazing Madonna meets Janet-esque flavored sound. She uses ,more than once the growing-up limbo term like a lot!

B000005ITX|5.0|Aaaaahhhhhh, what a wonderful surprise this album was.  Forever Changes immediately shot into my Top 5 Albums list...cheesy I know (but come on, what music freak DOESN'T have one?)  Upon first listen its impossible to tell where the music will take you.  Constant changes and mad shifts in rhythm are scattered throughout this masterpiece supported by Arthur Lee's cockily confident vocals.  The fact that this band remains overlooked 30 years after the release of this album adds enormously to their appeal.  It makes you feel like you're a part of a special 'in-the-know' club...the owner of an album promoted by word-of-mouth only.  Sooo, see me doing my bit to spread the word....you must buy this album!  (&quot;All the God's children gotta have their...free-dom!&quot;)
B00005OM4N|4.0|I thought Britney Spears was going nowhere, but this changed my mind.  Like someone else said, it's not the best artistic effort ever, but you can definitely see it as a good start.  I was racking my mind for how she could possibly make the transition from a short-lived trend to something solid and I couldn't figure it out for the life of me.  SHe has surprised me with how well she has started that transition.  Now we just got to see what happens next.

B00003CX96|5.0|This won an award for screenplay and we are getting a bare bones DVD. Sure I am happy to see one of my favorite movies on DVD but why no commentaries?<br />Anyway, if you have not seen this film, rent it, buy it. Its wonderful. Its a great story about growing up and falling in love and about family and friendship.<br />You'll have a wonderful feeling after viewing it. You dont get that when you see Hollywood movies these days which is ashame.
006016848X|3.0|There is much good to be found in John Gray's book, such as the importance of truly listening, appreciating, and supporting your partner. Where he and I differ is his contention (not always laid out in the open, and I'm sure he would disagree that it exists at all) that women are somehow intellectually stunted, or that they need to be treated like large children; he implies this when he writes things like that women have a &quot;need&quot; to complain, and he seems to belive that a good man must silently suffer his partners' uncontrollable urge to whine.
B0000541VU|5.0|This is a powerful and moving film. You are not likely to finish viewing it with dry eyes.
B0000024ZT|5.0|I am a brand new, 19-year-old Bruce fan. I have just finished reading the rest of the reviews and I am confused. A good friend of mine gave me two of Bruce's cd's to start off with: &quot;Greetings...&quot; and &quot;The Wild...&quot; I'd never heard Bruce before, and I was completely astonished when I heard it. Bruce Springsteen is absolutely incredible. I listened to it nonstop for a month, and easily picked out what I considered to be the best. On \\"Greetings\\", two of my favorites were \\"Mary, Queen of Arkansas\\" and \\"The Angel\\", second only to \\"Lost in the Flood.\\" I don't understand why all the reviews seem to cast those as the weakest points of the album. What struck me about Bruce was his compassion, intensity, and the forcefulness of his poetic, melancholic yet youthful sincerity. I find those qualities most in the songs that everyone else finds lacking. I am now at the complete mercy of Bruce's romantic, expressive genius and I will faithfully stick by that side of him. I hope I'm not the only one who appreciates these masterpieces.
B0000062GK|5.0|I'm tempted to call Joe Satriani the best guitarist of all time after listening to this album... friends of mine say &quot;well it's solo guitar, it has to be amazing&quot; and I suppose that may be true, but this is a spectacular piece of music... my favorite song is Love Thing... What an amazing song... This guy Joe Satriani has caught on tape the exact feeling of being in love, as far as I'm concerned... it is beautiful... It's like the guitar is singing... I also like track 7, and the song Time... the second part of Time is awesome, and track 7 is a rocking song... This album is great, and Love Thing is right up there with Flying on a Blue Dream as one of my favorite Satriani songs... check it out if you like guitar music...
0449227545|2.0|The problem of this book is that you know in the first pages who is the bad guy, so you know that he will have to lose at the end.  The way they are living in the village I think that is a little bit out of the reality.
6300248569|4.0|The thing that really annoyed me was that the dialogues had been switched around. For example, in the book, if Elizabeth says something to Jane, in this adaptation she says it instead to Wickham. Other than that, it was better than the 1996 adaptation because the characters seemed to fit in more. Elizabeth is not supposed to be more beautiful than Jane and surely she is not. David Rintoul was excellent, he is supposed to be slightly wooden so I am not sure I agree with all the criqitues of his performance. The two miscasts in my opinion were Wickham (I thought he was supposed be very handsome in looks, much more so than Darcy) and Kitty (why on earth was she so old?)<BR>Overall, if you are a Jane Austen fan, you must see both adaptations but if you only want a romantic love story, get the A&E version.

0440214041|5.0|The Pelican Brief, by John Grisham, is an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a book full of suspense and action. Grisham uses foreshadowing, and suspense in The Pelican Brief, to keep the reader's attention. This book is hard to put down once you have begun reading because of all the action and the anticipation of what will happen next.  Grisham uses foreshadowing to clue the reader as what to expect to come, but he does not give away what will happen. The little clues here and there, are vague enough that you do not know what exactly will happen or when it will happen which makes the book even more suspenseful. For example, before Justice Rosenberg and Justice Jensen are murdered Grisham keeps the dialogue focused on how Rosenberg and Jensen refuse to let the FBI follow them to the extent the FBI would like to.  In this quote, the narrator is talking about how Justice Rosenberg dislikes the FBI or cops near him. Therefore, he does not allow them in certain areas.  \\"The Justice allowed no FBI agents near him. They could follow in their car, and they could watch his townhouse from the street, and they were lucky to get that close.\\" Statements like that keep the book interesting and suspenseful and gradually clue the reader that a big event is about to occur. Grisham alludes to the danger they are in by continually repeating that they are the only two Justices that do not allow the FBI to cover all areas of their life. The setting of this book is in present day Washington D.C. and New Orleans, Louisiana.  This book is an excellent book that I would recommend to any reader who enjoys reading suspense books. This book is almost impossible to put down once you begin reading it.
6301763041|5.0|Crybaby is one of my favorites movies, and one that any John Waters lover should see.  Being that this movie is one of Waters, Crybaby may not be the best of his work, but it is far more entertaining and funny than Hairspray or Pink Flamingos.  The purposely over-dramatization and cheddar-cheesiness completely makes the movie.  The music is brilliant too.  Please take one look at Hatchet Face and just try not to laugh--it's not possible.  This is one of the best made and directed movies of all time.  If you enjoy zany comedy and the fusion of past and present, please watch Crybaby.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|It doesn't matter if you're a Bob Dylan scholar or if you get him mixed up with Bob Denver, this is great album. It is thoroughly enjoyable on whatever level you take it for. The driving blues rhythms and rich instrumentation, and yes, Bob's masterful voice make it superbly listenable. The lyrics are playful and mysterious and crystalline and unmistakable Dylan. It's obviously a well-crafted classic. I'm puttin it right next to Blood on the Tracks; that is if I ever get it out of my CD player.
B00005NP04|5.0|This is what you call a true greatest hits album. Martina put all her hit singles, favorite songs, and plus some new songs to make this album complete. I was late getting into country music and even later getting into Martina. This album confirms that she is the real deal and how far off Shania Twain is. It also confirms that America's radio and fans must figure out what is true talent and what is not. She doesn't get the recognition she deserves. The only complaint I have is Martina doesn't write her own songs. I love all the songs, every last one of them. My favorite song is Concrete Angel, which is one of the best songs I've heard that deals with child abuse. Overall a must have album if you like modern-day country music.
6304082428|5.0|Wow.<br />I've been a fan of this miniseries for a few years now and it never fails to blow me away. The plot, the acting, the costumes, the perfect blend of satire and drama are enough to make a romantic of anyone. This is the movie that made and anglophile of me.<br />The tale is a familiar one, the tempestuous romance between Miss Prejudice and Mr. Pride personified. Darcy and Elizabeth are a marvelous pair, likable but by no means perfect. The whole thing is handled with such taste and elegance that many modern movie makers should be ashamed of themselves by comparison.<br />I cannot think of a single weak point in the movie except for this:<br />It is addictive. I was sadly unable to watch the entire series in one gulp but I stayed up late many a night until I had watched every tape. The fourth one is the killer, it will literally mesmerize.<br />In case you haven't noticed, i only liked this movie a little. ;-) Give yourself a treat and watch this smart, funny romance and fall in love with it yourself.
B00005LMBK|4.0|As a fan of Blur, I had no choice but to love this album.  Every song has a great beat (props to Russel) and bass line (ditto to Murdoc).  The lyrics are good, a very ecclectic work offering almost every music lover with something they'll enjoy.  This is a sure bet. I assure you that there will at least be 2 or 3 songs on this one that you'll enjoy.  You can't go wrong with this one.  Buy it, you won't regret it!
0743216458|4.0|While the book may rely too much on Winters, and I will acknowledge a few really small accuracy issues - the focus of this book is much more on the subjective and personal experiences of this company of soldiers. I found the book and the movie believable and consistent with what I have heard from combat veterans.  Is Ambrose a true historian or a very good story recorder?  I think the latter but that does not reduce the value of the work he contributes - he puts flesh on the bones of dry citations and 'history' as still photograph and diary.  Both are needed and valued, and have a place.  <br />Winters, of course, was injured in the leg during the Caretan battle in Normandy.  And it is incredibly dubious to me that anyone could get away with gross exagerrations with the dozens of 506th veterans interviewed. <br />I think these works are important to filling out the combat experience of the soldier.
B000000W5N|5.0|Steve Knopper's editorial review starts out...&quot;'Sister Morphine,' the heart of guitarist Mick Taylor's first full studio album with the Stones...&quot; and continues &quot;...the ringing guitars of Taylor and Keith Richards build to full catharsis behind (Mick[Jagger, that is!])...&quot; This is some real interesting HYPERBOLE, since the liner notes from the original vinyl release indicate for &quot;Sister Morphine&quot;: C WATTS, drums; B WYMAN, bass; K RICHARD, guitar; RY COODER, guitar; M JAGGER, vocal; JACK NITZCHE, piano...That &quot;Sister Morphine&quot; is &quot;the heart&quot; of STICKY FINGERS does get it right, though. This is probably the GREATEST 5min:34sec-THAT-SHOULD-HAVE-BEEN-12min:34sec-RECORDING EVER MADE! That gut-gnawing guitar soar in the middle could easily have gone on 3, 4 5(!) minutes before Mick insinuates in &quot;...well, it just goes to show: things are not what the seem...&quot; Similarly the final jam fades off way too soon for my money!  I had high hopes when I saw &quot;Sister&quot; on the cover of the 1998 live effort NO SECURITY. Surely the live jam would rock on &amp; on! I thought. But at 6:04 I wondered why they bothered. If you're a Stones fan, STICKY FINGERS is in your collection period.

B00003CXRM|5.0|I was reluctant to see this movie because I was doubtful that George Clooney would pull it off. I think he is a wonderful actor, but I saw him as being Doug Ross in the Depression Era South, and that didn't work for me. But I wanted to see it because I am such a music fan, and come on, this is some great musical work!  However, I will proudly admit that I couldn't have been more wrong about George. I now know that Clooney is one of the best actors of our time and he truly gave an excellent performance. His comedic performance in this movie was unparalleled! This is now one of my favorite movies and I hope that Clooney is given many more roles that let him expand his talent, so that he isn't typecast as the handsome rogue in everything.  There is much more to him than that.  As always, John Turturro gave an outstanding performance, as did Holly Hunter and John Goodman...LOVE HIM! And I fell in love with Tim Blake Nelson's Delmar. This movie should be on everyone's list of favorites and you HAVE to buy the soundtrack.  And back to Clooney....wow!  Give Hollywood Hell, George...get more great roles like this one!!

I am buying it for my niece Brittany who I hope enjoys and cherishes this wonderful book as much as I do. This book has a great story of a bunny who is going to bed, and wants to make sure he says goodnight to everything he sees before he falls asleep. It is a classic that any age loves.
6304493681|3.0|this was an okay anime flick. i'm a huge anime fan so of coarse i had to see this. its got an intresting plot but not enough emotion from the characters. plus it could use a bit more faster moving scenes. the whole dark future city thing looks allot like AKIRA does. if your an anime fan go and take a stab at this movie but if your not and anime fan, dont even bother watching it. you'll just be lost.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I found this movie to be extremelly rude.  I don't feel that alot of the content is suitable for children.  The hidden meanings in this were appalling and adults who make such movies for children should know better.  YES, Children do pay attention and in this day and age we parents need all the help we can get. I'm glad at least I do preview movies before showing them to my child and nieces and nephews...  The reviews this movie got just leave me dumbfounded.  Let me ask, those who reviewed it, Did you actually watch it???
B000002TQV|5.0|There is nothing negative I can say about this.  Even though I am not enticed by a disc so heavily dependant upon guitars, there is not one flaw in this disc.  All the songs are class A.  You can hear the thought that was put into this music.  My favorite songs are &quot;Planet Telex&quot;, and &quot;Just&quot;.  All the songs are great.  This is a great band.  It is just well crafted, straight ahead, progressive rock.  The sonics are first rate.  Everything in this production is first rate.  It is so good, that I listen to all the time, and I am not really into this type of music.  It's guitar driven British Progressive Rock.  Definately buy this disc.  This is the type of disc that will make you realize that you are listening to something very special.
B00005QATY|5.0|Homer's Oddysey set during the Great Depression, with a trio of chain gang fugitives as the protagonists. Who woulda thunk? I don't know either, but give him credit for a fabulously enjoyable movie.<br />George Clooney is magnificent as Ulysses (that's really his name), an extremely witty and articulate convict who is obsessed with two things. The first is finding a hidden treasure from one of his earlier &quot;jobs,&quot; and second is his hair. The contrast between his brilliant and often incisive repartee, and the dull witted utterances of his oafish companions, is truly a sight to behold (can I say that about the spoken word?).<br />The &quot;Odyssey&quot; theme is well developed, complete with Sirens and the Cyclops (played by none other than John Goodman, of course), and the movie loosely follows its plot line. There are some interesting allusions to the supernatural, and some blatant allegorizing of several characters, such as the ubiquitous &quot;boss&quot; sheriff with the fires of hell reflecting from his sunglasses. Several scenes are downright surreal, while others will have you holding your gut with laughter. Oh, and by the way, the good guys manage to &quot;get religion&quot; and turn the popular music world on its head as they go on about their merry way.<br />Literary references aside, though, you'll enjoy this movie immensely even if you've never read Homer. The language is generally unobjectionable, there's no nudity, and minimal non-gory violence, in other words, a family friendly affair. Watch this flick. You'll be glad you did.
B000002ADT|5.0|I'm rating this 5 stars, because this is the most listened to Jazz album of all time.  People who don't listen to Jazz listen to &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.  I like the album.  I don't adore this album.  The first four songs are classics.  &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; is Ok.  I could live without this song.  Miles is great, very cool,  Just the coolest, as usual. It's a modal exercise and a very bluesy, cool experience.  Paul Chambers' bass opening on &quot;So What&quot; is just a classic and something you want to own, just to experience it.  Parts of the album are dark, courtesy of Bill Evans, and I like that.  It gives a very relaxing, cool, feel.  It isn't dated at all.  It sounds as relevant today as it did in 1959.  The thing about the performance that ruins it for me is the alto sax.  I don't like the playing.  It's grating, and a style that doesn't fit in with the recording.  John Coltrane could have carried the sax improvising by himself.  I have to get past the alto player on every track he plays on.  I grate my teeth having to endure it.  My opinion.  You may have a different experience when you hear it, but this is my experience with this album. I experience this with the album every time I listen to it.  I don't like the style of the player.  Everyone is so totally cool, and the alto is a grating, cartoonish sound.  The alto doesn't belong here.  It would have been a much better album with different personel.  Of course you have to buy it, because it's an album of major importance in the history of Jazz.  Another side light is that this is only place you are going to get to hear &quot;So What&quot; played slow, making it the ultimate cool song here.  Every recording of this song after this album; the song is played at a fast pace and run through quickly.  I do not understand why Miles played the song like that, but this is clearly the best version of the classic song.  This is the only place you can get it, so buy this disc.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Although this CD won't sell as well as &quot;oops&quot; in its first week, its sales show that Britney isn't leaving us anytime soon, and that she is still a dominating force in the world of pop music.  The songs are pure Britney style, and they are awesome!  Every song on  this album is awesome.  It makes me so proud to be a Britney fan.  Seriously, if you are not a britney fan pick this album up.  She is so real and down to earth, how couldn't you. Of course if you are a britney fan I'm sure that you already have it.  Keep supporting Britney! She totally deserves it.
0060012331|5.0|Despite the 9-12 suggested reading age that Amazon lists, this book is a lot more adult than I expected. I figured that the story would be dumbed down for the children, but I bought it anyway because I'm a Pratchett fanboi.<br />Well, I was wrong. The story is easily on par with Pratchett's other Discworld novels, and doesn't appear to be dumbed down in the least. I didn't laugh as much reading this novel as I have when reading some of his previous works, but that's probably because this story is just a tad darker than some of the other Discworld novels. Still, it was a very enjoyable read, and I highly recommend it.
B000006OAM|5.0|A friend of mine with eclectic taste in music, brought this cd to work.  I loved it. It is one of my favorites...I listen to it often, although I have a large, diverse music collection. I particularly like &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; and &quot;Ring Those Golden Bells&quot;.  Okay, so you wouldn't take this CD to a party. So what. No matter what the music critics say, if it moves you, then it is great music.  Nuff said.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is possibly the best metal albums I've ever heard. Compared to the nu-metal bands and all the damn trends on radio, nothing can compare to this album. Hetfield and Hammett did an excellent job with some guitar solos and Burton did an outstanding job with the bass guitar with songs like &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Damage, Inc.&quot; Metallica also did a good job on Ride the Lightning and ...And Justice For All but Master of Puppets was and still is a true masterpiece.<BR>Other good albums out there are &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot; by Pantera and &quot;Reign In Blood&quot; by Slayer.
0385486804|3.0|I really liked this book, well parts of it anyway. As the backcover mentions, this story shows the unromantic side of nature. You get a sense that it's not that easy to &quot;love&quot; the wild because it will likely kill you, given the chance.  Jon Krakauer does a very good job of telling this story and deconstructing &quot;Alex&quot;.  What I didn't like was how much of his own life Krakauer puts into this book.  Frankly, I didn't really care about his life.  This book was like a dance.  Sometimes you have to talk to the ugly girls just to meet the pretty ones.  Krakauer's life, of course, being the ugly girl.  Essentially, I thought the author did an excellent job of story telling -- about Chris.  Through the story itself though, I think something more could have been said about the main character. I was left with an ambiguous understanding of Chris. On one hand he was saintly, and on the other he was self-absorbed.  Clearly a person can't have both satanic pride and virtuous humility. I think the author could have made a judgement call on this one and declared Chris in one light or the other. The world isn't just gray.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD is undoubtedly a breakthrough. For her fans, it is an incredibly enjoyable CD with an eclectic mix of styles. For her unfans, well maybe you will get tired of Britney-bashing by now. Anyway, here is my opinion of all the songs:<br />I'm A Slave 4 U - A good choice for the first single, not my fav on the album but definitley funky and fresh.<br />Overprotected - One of the poppier tunes, but with a different edge to it. I can see this as a single in the future.<br />Lonely - I think this is the STRONGEST track on the album. It has a definite rock edge to it, suits Britney's vocals nicely. I really hope this is a single, cuz it would show a whole new side of Britniey. <br />Not a Girl- Besides the drawn out title, definitely a good slow number. Unlike several of her earlier slow songs, this one has substance, surprisingly deep lyrics. Its about time she had a strong balld.<br />Boys - Not one of my favorite tracks, but definitely fun. Its showa a nastier side of Brintey that I like.<br />Anticipating - One of the most fun songs on the CD. It is not really single material, but it is just one of those little gems only people who own the CD can enjoy. Its got a disco beat and a hook that you can't get out of your head.<br />I Love Rock and Roll - A good cover song, a nice touch to the album, not one of my favs though.<br />Cinderella - Another one of the more poppy songs that has a cathy melody. Once again, not a song that will be a single, but enjoyable none the less.<br />Let Me Be - Another great song, but to be honest I don'y remember a lot about it so it must not be a very memorable one.<br />Bombastic Love- Ok now, I am a wee bit embarrased to say this is my favorite song because it is very poppy and cheesy, but the melody is just irresistable. I am always sure to nevery miss this track, it is too much fun.<br />That's Where You Take Me - As somebody else said, it is an electroballad. This is one of my fried's favorite track.<br />What It's Like to Be Me -Surprisingly good, I wasn't expecting a whole lot for this song but it is a great way to end the CD!<br />All in all, I'd say my favorite tracks are: Lonely! Overprotected, Anticipating, Not A Girl, and yes, Bombastic Love!
0671027344|4.0|when my friend first told me about this book, i was kind of skeptical that i would really enjoy it-- i am not used to such an honest, up front literary style. it shocked me. but after only a few pages, i became hooked. i even disliked much of it, but i still wanted to read it. the main character, charlie, almost seemed to have become a real person, or someone i certaintly wish i knew in real life. i can relate to him on many different levels. and i think we all can. but there came a point while reading--around 3/4 through the book--that stephen chbosky seemed to be ruining charlie! he was falling victim to drugs, sex &amp; psychological problems (he seemed to just maunder on about things too much sometimes, and i was getting annoyed everytime he cried which is A LOT)... at this point i was hating the book. i would never tell anyone to read it! but my friend who originally suggested the book urged me to find out how the end unfolds... and i can't even tell you. i should just say you need to read it for yourself. i feel it has a good ending, but only you can decide that. this is one of those books that you can either love or hate, and even if you hate it you will never regret reading it because of the profound impact and deep honesty that it has. would i say it's one of the best books i've ever read? no way. from a literary perspective it's kind of weak-- but i think that's part of the point. stephen chbosky didn't need to dress it up with flowery words and deep metaphysical concepts. he just made charlie so in touch with the most important of all human emotions--love. and it makes you stop and think about life and you'll find yourself being less selfish and more observant to other lives around you and how everyone has a past and a future-- not just yourself. at least that's what it did to me. charlie has certaintly reminded me the joie de vivre. quite a good book.
B00005QDW5|4.0|THE BAND: Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (guitars, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards), Nick Mason (drums & percussion), Syd Barrett (vocals, guitar).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (2001) 26 total tracks on two discs (disc-1 at 76:50, disc-2 at 78:36). Included with the discs is a 30-page booklet containing song credits/titles, song lyrics, what songs came from which albums, year released, band photos, and obscure artwork relating to album covers. The booklet cover is one piece of artwork with elements from most (if not all) their album covers. Songs follow Pink Floyd albums released from 1967-1994. 24-bit digitally remastered sound. Label - Capital / EMI.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn (2 songs), A Saucerful Of Secrets (2), Meddle (2), Dark Side Of The Moon (4), Wish You Were Here (2), Animals (1), The Wall (4), The Final Cut (1), A Momentary Lapse Of Reason (2), The Division Bell (3), Movie Soundtrack-The Wall (1), unreleased (2).<br /><br />COMMENTS: Reflecting on 30 years of Pink Floyd and then coming up with songs to fill (only) 2 compact discs is no easy task... especially when some of the band's songs can take up one whole album (vinyl) side. This is a nice collection. It hits most of the highlights - taking tunes from the early Syd Barrett era, and highlighting the brain of Roger Waters & some incredible guitar work by David Gilmore. \\"Dark Side\\", \\"Animals\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Meddle\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Final Cut\\", \\"Piper At The Gates of Dawn\\", \\"Division Bell\\", \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" are all represented here. Not so much is this a \\"greatest hits\\" collection, but rather the journey of the band. The band probably had a big say in choosing the songs... you'll notice many of the most radio friendly songs are missing - The Wall's \\"Run Like Hell\\", \\"Young Lust\\"; The Division Bell's biggest hit \\"Take It Back\\"; Wish You Were Here's \\"Welcome To The Machine\\", \\"Have A Cigar\\", Animal's \\"Dogs\\", and anything from \\"Atom Mother Heart\\". Also noted - several songs are edited (\\"Echoes\\", \\"High Hopes\\", \\"Marooned\\", \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", \\"One Of These Days\\")... this is a huge negative in my opinion. While most albums are represented with only a song or two, understandably, \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon\\" have four cuts from each. I own all of PF's cd's from the 1970's & 80's... but this collection is worth owning simply for the remastered versions of such classic songs, having many of them compiled onto a 2-cd set, and last but not least... having some of those early band tracks and unreleased songs (\\"See Emily Play\\", \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\", \\"Arnold Layne\\", etc). If you are just being introduced to the band, this would be an excellent place to start. If you are looking for a few of their best studio releases, I'd recommend \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", or \\"The Wall\\". Nice package, but far from perfect (4 stars).are edited (\\"Echoes\\", \\"High Hopes\\", \\"Marooned\\", \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", \\"One Of These Days\\")... this is a huge negative in my opinion.

B00004XPPE|5.0|What a sobering view of the &quot;Cold War&quot;!<br />Fail Safe is a far-too-real scenario that has almost happened a few times. On a few occassions, both America and Russia came within 2 minutes of starting World War III, due to technological<BR>&quot;glitches&quot;, such as satellites mistaking the Sun's reflection off of clouds for the heat of an ICBM.<br />The message the movie tries to make is that mankind was becoming too dependent upon technology. And we were going to pay the ultimate price for this. It's amazing that the authors of the novel the movie of the same name is based upon had such great &quot;vision&quot; and foresight.<br />Fail Safe also does a fantastic job of showing the Cold War paranoia of both the American &amp; Soviet military and government &quot;higher ups&quot;.<br />For those who have not seen it, the ending will send a chill down your spine, and may even bring tears to your eyes!<br />There were great acting performances all around. The actors that played General Black &amp; General Bogan, the two &quot;voices of reason&quot;<BR>in the military leadership are two of the best performances I've ever seen. Henry Fonda brought to life his role as the most powerful man in the world. The late Walter Matthau was outstanding as the politcal scientist-Pentagon advisor who wanted the U.S. to take advantage of the madness to wipe-out our<BR>&quot;mortal enemy&quot;.<br />Fail Safe is a movie &quot;for the ages&quot;!
0451169514|4.0|The first time I read &quot;It,&quot; I was maybe 16, and was scared silly by the idea of a monster that feeds on our fears.  I was then, and am now, amazed at how much King made me care about his characters, and how fleshed out they were.  Then I grew up.  Got an education, got married, had kids.  Having children was for me, at age 27, a wake-up call to my own mortality, and that our lives are precious and short, and sadly non-magical.  <br />A belief in (metaphorical or real) Magic, like that Our Players use and are manipulated by, is in awfully short supply as we grow older, and the characters struggle to recapture their belief in Magic (Why do you think Harry Potter is so popular amongst adults anyway?).  <br />When I finished the book at age 16, I was relieved that the heroes had whupped It and set things right.  At 27, I was struck by a sense of loss, both vicarious and personal.  What effect does forgetting our childhood (as many of us do) have on adulthood?  King's apparent thesis is that it makes being an adult no damned fun - we become constricted with the obligations of adulthood and lose our sense of wonder and longing, and forget how to dream.  <br />While King challenges us to remember the beauty of childhood, there is a caution as well, as the main characters struggle to conquer the demons of childhood. In a literal sense, It pulls them back for a confrontation with Itself, as well as the evil personage of Henry Bowers.  Metaphorically, they must face the scars of their own childhoods which continue to plague them; abuse, emotional coldness, death of a brother, being The Fat Kid, being a hypochondriac weakling, being a target of bigotry - in short, being different.  Their success comes at a high price, though.<br />My only real criticisms of this book are the fact that it is bloody long, and although the adolescent sex scene didn't really offend me, it did confuse me - I'm still not entirely sure of its function in the book, besides as a bookend to Bill and Beverly's shagging.  Maybe it's a way of pointing out that when the Magic leaves, all we have left are Love and Desire, and we'd better hold on to those for all we're worth.  As adults, it certainly seems that those two things are often all we do have.<br />Also, I was disappointed that in the end, the characters begin to forget again - it seems to defy King's admonition to remember the magic of childhood.  The ending was not entirely satisfactory, but you can't have everything.  In Real Life, endings are rarely totally satisfactory, and fiction is not required to differ in that regard.<br />All told, this is an interesting, emotional, absorbing read, and certainly King's magnum opus.  I highly recommend that younger readers (like under 22 or so) wait 6 or 8 years before reading the book again, until they've seen a bit more of life.  Doing so will certainly change your perspective on &quot;It&quot;.
0345409671|3.0|I am a huge Anne Rice fan and am particularly fond of &quot;The Chronicles.&quot; Memnoch the Devil is laced with biblical fantasy from top to bottom. Being an atheist, this did not originally appeal to me. However, once I finished I realized what a gift this piece is...It makes you think! Besides what could possibly be more interesting than Lestat meeting Jesus Christ? It's far out, but enthralling nonetheless.
B000050XEI|3.0|Sounds like the same monotone easy listening hum. I guess its OK if that's what you're into. But I thought there would be something different this time around. I guess not. Anyway, I'd like to hear what Enya really sounds like whithout all the studio tricks such as the multi-tracking on her voice.
0394800184|5.0|While the story is not complex by any means, it's loads of fun for both adults and kids. Every kid, and most adults, can relate to little bird. Who hasnt been lost as a child? What with the happy ending and all, its family fun all around.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is Britney's best album by far.  I am an older fan and was<BR>pleasantly surprise to hear a different sound from Britney.<BR>This album definitely shows Britney's maturity as an artist and a<BR>women.  The music is very upbeat and not so much the &quot;bubble gum&quot; pop sound from the past albums.  I think everyone who buys this CD will be very surprised to find that this is her best work to date.  Also, I most say Justin Timberlake and Britney voices blend very nicely together on &quot;What It's Like To Be Me&quot;.
6303637493|5.0|I can't say enough about this film.  I happened upon it by accident, and was blown away.  The music, the story, the performances, the costuming... all of it over and above your average film.  <BR>I was never a fan of opera, and still am not overly fond of it.  This film goes beyond musical taste.  I was a little confused at first by all the &quot;dream&quot; sequences, and the significance of the horses, but it just took a second viewing (not a hardship at all!) to clear it all up.  <BR>Dionisi, as Farinelli, a handsome man in his own right, looks oddly gorgeous in an almost feminine way.  His performance is phenominal - down to the difficult lip-synch, which I thought he carried off with a minimum of noticable mistakes.  And the costumes - the stage sets - wow.  Beauty beyond compare.  The distinctive castrati voice, by the way, was a digital combination of a female soprano and a male tenor. <BR>This is a beautiful period piece,with wonderful performances by the entire cast.  I can't recommend it enough.  And if you don't know who Stefano Dionisi is, you'll be a fan by the time the film is over.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Well, I have to compliment Britney on keeping up with her image. This CD is very sensual. Seems like all the songs involve her, a guy, &amp; sex. And in all the songs, there's a standard beat, &amp; some girls singing higher than Britney (who is singing low). Some of the songs borrow things from other artists &amp; one of the songs Britney just re-did. There is nothing outstanding about the way this CD was done, and there is nothing stunning about her vocals. A good artist wouldn't have to promote themselves by wearing revealing clothes &amp; dancing among writhing bodies. Sorry everyone.
B00000DLUV|5.0|I have a copy of an album, bought in about 1973, entitled The Bee Gees' Greatest Hits. The album is full of truly great songs like Massachusetts and New York Mining Disaster 1941. I have a later compilation from about 1980 which is also entitled The Bee Gees' Greatest Hits, which includes 'the disco stuff' (although in fairness that description does not do it justice) and most of the earlier compilation. So what do they do in the late 1990s, when you would probably need a double or even triple album to fit in all the classic tracks? Simple., they release a live album. This has so many advantages. Firstly they can record shortened versions of well-known hits, even putting some together in medleys so fans don't feel short-changed. They can also do their own versions of hits they wrote and produced for others, such as Islands In The Stream for Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, and Heartbreaker for Dionne Warwick. The other songs are all pretty faithful to the original recordings, no mean feat when you are covering a thirty year career with one night's musicians. So although there is the live feel, with announcements and applause, this album is a worthy retrospective of this dazzling career, perhaps more original than yet another hits collection, but who is to say it won't need revising in another ten years when the Bee Gees have clocked up their sixth U.K. Number one?
B000000OMP|3.0|I'm not a total Whitesnake fan - just one of those guys that thinks David Coverdale has a good voice and probably didn't fully realize his potential.  Slide It In is significant for me because it has the best Whitesnake song ever - &quot;Slow and Easy&quot; - which for some strange reason, has never been bettered.  The first 3 cuts on this album are the best, but the rest falter for me - partly because of Coverdale's poor lyrics.  But this is worth the price of admission for Slow and Easy (or buy their Greatest Hits instead).  Coverdale's voice is at its peak on this particular seismic track.
6305538018|3.0|Despite David Cronenberg's position as my second-favourite director, even an out-and-out fan like me notices when he starts to repeat himself. One of the problems with auteur directors who write, produce, and direct their movies is that you tend to see a repetition of themes. Now these might be put down to style, but there are lots of ideas here from Videodrome and The Fly, albeit with more up to the minute special effects. The obsession with the body, self-inflicted bodily change and decay is here, with a good measure of William Gibson thrown in. Unless I missed something, the idea of plugging yourself into an organic computer and experiencing virtual reality first came up in the Matrix in 1976's Doctor Who in the story The Deadly Assassin, and the idea of not knowing which reality you are in has been rather worn out by Philip K. Dick. It's not a bad film by any means, and Jude Law turns in a particularly impressive performance. It is however predictable and derivative, and a director with a track record for originality as good as Cronenberg's is capable of so much more.
B000002J0B|5.0|Sure, it's debatable.  Which was LZ's best album?  This is usually my favourite because the Zeps had really matured into their own sound.  Funk, rock, gothic, folk, reggae, blues - it's all here and amalgamated into one sound.  There's a certain freedom and happiness to this album that isn't on the band's other albums.  A certain &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; feel.  Songs like &quot;The Ocean&quot; also reflect a ray of sunshine.  Hard to explain?  With lyrics like &quot;Dance the hoochie-koo!&quot; on The Song Remains the Same - you can feel where Plant, Page, Jones and Bonham were at at the time.  Only &quot;No Quarter&quot; (a popular live track) perpetuates Zep's penchant for Viking norse doom and gloom, but serves as a nice contrast.  &quot;The Grunge&quot; reflects an abandon that you wouldn't hear on many other zep tracks.  &quot;Dancing Days&quot; and &quot;D'yer Maker&quot; are cool tracks. I can't imagine Led Zep's repertoire without this album.  For those who only know IV and II - it's time to explore and expand your mind with Houses of the Holy.  Really.
0385474547|4.0|In Chinua Achebes novel Things Fall Apart, Achebe uses literary devices to tell the story a couple of devices she uses are tone, tense, themes, symbols and Foreshadowing, she uses them throughout the entire novel to explain here feelings. The climax of the novel was when the leader of the clan Okonkwo is murdered. The climax of the story was kind of sad because Okonkwo died. The narrator of the novel is anonymous but shows sympathy for some people. The narration is in the third person by an omniscient figure who is focused on Okonkwo but switch through many different characters. Chinua tone of the book was Ironic, she was sort of mocking the tone, almost fable like. She writes in the past tense. The falling action of the novel was when the villagers let the white governments messengers to escape and Okonkwo felt that is was a weakness the village. One of the themes of the novel was the fight between culture and change. Achebes uses some different symbols one was Fire, which represented Okonkwo's nature, a fierce, wild person just like a fire. She used foreshadowing in the book, it was when the locust arrive which symbolizes the arrival of the white men. Things Fall Apart is very good and I urge you to read this book.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Presence shows Zep in a survival - rather than soaring - mode.  The most significant difference here is Robert Plant's voice.  Lower, weaker but somewhat unbowed - he nonetheless tries his best, with mixed results.  The mix here is spartan, and generally absent of Zeppelin's rich grandiose soundscapes.  Not for those expecting incendiary Zeppelin, but rather for those who want to explore their legacy.  Zep delivers with its usual epics here &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine.&quot;
B000002W9P|4.0|The first album featuring singer Michael Kiske was Helloween´s best. Unfortunately, it would be their last really worthwhile album. Take it easy, take it easy!! I know KEEEPER II is also very good, but one can already see the difference, the impetus in Kai Hansen´s playing is clearly vanishing... And, like you or not, Kai Hansen was the soul of Helloween.<br />KEEPER I has an unique atmosphere, a certain punch, the best solos ever recorded by Hansen and Weikath, precise drumming, clear bass lines. I don´t like Kiske´s vocals (there is not a single German singer that I can think of being a really great singer, but it suited the band greatly.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti was a watershed album.  That it comprises 2 albums is significant.  People don't realise that many of the tracks here were recorded much earlier - reflecting the wealth of material Zep had accumulated up to this point.  The cross-section of material here is marvelous - it's hard to pigeonhole Zeppelin and those who do simply label Zep as a hard rock band don't get it.  Unfortunately, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; was to be in many ways, the end of a great run before the band suffered a decline - contributing to the mythic status of this album.  The '75 tour had Plant in poor voice; in 76 he would suffer an accident and &quot;Presence&quot; the next Zep album seemed eons away from this one.  Listen to Physical Graffiti and experience a rock band at its finest.  Satisfaction guaranteed.

And wait till you see the lighting fast animation, I mean it's...it's...incredible! And the plot will keep you going till the credits, it's about this dude who gets cursed and this girl...well I don't want to give away any of the plot really, because that's the whole movie. So I did't get to see this movie in theaters but I got the VHS, and the VHS totaly RULED even tho I had to watch it on my 25in color TV!!!<br />The Voice actors:<br />This movie has an outstanding cast of voice actors featuring, Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudrup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver, Jada Pinkett Smith and Billy Bob Thornton...<br />Animation:<br />Well what can I say about the animation??? Other than it's totaly kick butt to the end!!!<br />So if you like Anime or even if you don't like anime than get this movie! It's the best movie that you'll ever see.<BR>Later...
0783225903|5.0|One of my favorite films of all time.  A rare film that actually has a unique production design that is not derivitive of other films and a great story at the same time.  But by all means, do not buy anything but the Criterion Collection version unless you hate yourself.
B000001ED1|4.0|Great CD, soulful, and it IS Bonnie Raitt-like -- but not too derivative.
B000006045|5.0|Timeless masterpiece. That's probably what best describes this album. The mood is noticably darker here than on previous Massive attack albums, and I guess their fan audience has shifted considerably since this album. Massive attack constantly reinvent themselves, never more so than on this album. Absolutely a timeless masterpiece and I'm looking forward to the follow-up.
B00005OAJ1|5.0|I first saw them on SNL and thought nothing of it.  Then, I saw it again and looked them up on the internet.  I found a bunch of live mp3's, downloaded them, made a cd, and have been laughing ever since.  This album doesn't take too much away from the original format of their songs--it only adds to it.  Dave Grohl's drums are great, as usual, and Kyle's playing is much better then you'd expect. Strictly for those who know how to laugh...and ROCK!
B00005QG9J|3.0|You say what you want to say, but c'mon, S.C.I.E.N.C.E. is eons better than this music Incubus is pumping out.  You want mellow?, listen to Anti-gravity Love Song.  You want hard?, listen to New Skin.  You want funk?, listen to Calgone.  It's ridiculous that Incubus has made such a paradigm shift and gone into this mellow territory.  Sure, they're trying to please their &quot;fans&quot;, but who are their real fans? Those of us who have been listening to them for a few years or those who think Make Yourself hasn't even been out for a year.  I hope Incubus brings back a mixture of all of their styles in their next works, that's what I was hoping for here, I thought Incubus might try to recreate Certain Shade of Green or Favorite Things.  It's too bad they didn't, I hope they try.
630349255X|5.0|This visually exquisite film is a meditation with music but no words.  I viewed it with a group of 40 people who were speechless after it ended.  Many wanted to know how to purchase it--it beckons to the thinking viewer to be watched again.
B000009QPE|5.0|I'd turn this into a long-winded review, but I'll sum it up.<br />Do you consider yourself a true metal fan, but do not own this album?<br />Shame on you. You are not a heavy metal fan until you experience this 28 minute opus of terror.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|Wow, I guess I am one of the few who didn't like this movie.  In fact, I didn't even finish watching it.  I was really interested to see it after all the good things I had heard.  I am also a big fan of Eddie Murphy, but it was completely overdone...<br />The 2 stars are for the animation....
6304994540|2.0|&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; is about characters whose identities are just facades for little-boy bickering. Or perhaps I completely misinterpreted the message and gave this movie two stars for no reason.<br />I watched &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; on the sole basis of Roger Ebert's review, because the phrase &quot;that rug really tied the room together&quot; brought a smile to my face. &quot;The Dude,&quot; the main character, really does say the line - in every scene starting with the very first. The line becomes a running gag throughout the movie, generously peppered with &quot;f***&quot; and its various inflections. That also might have been funny, had the filmmakers focused on the fact that profanity was the only way the vocabulary-challenged characters could lend weight to their words. But no. The film simply goes on, effortlessly and without engaging the audience, until it is finally over and the viewer begins wondering what exactly he just saw and why.<br />The plot is really just an excuse for the numerous character vignettes: in the first scene, &quot;The Dude&quot; Lebowski (Bridges) is introduced. He is mistaken by the local pornographer's thugs for the Millionaire Lebowki, whose wife apparently owes money around town. The thugs beat the Dude up and urinate on his rug, and therein lies the Dude's motivation to stay in the movie. The Dude is a fairly good character, lazy, and unperturbed, yet practical, but the film does so little with him that he quickly becomes an eyesore.<br />In the followin scenes, the Dude's bowling buddies, Walter and Danny (Buscemi), are introduced. Danny is a cipher, short and simple. Walter (Goodman) tries to take control of every situation by the virtue of his powerful lungs. He also curses a lot. Danny later dies of a heart attack, so that the wind can later blow his cremated remains in the Dude's face.<br />The Dude visits the real Lebowski, a wheelchair-bound millionaire who thinks too much of himself, and steals one of hisrugs. We learn that Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunny, has been kidnapped, and the Dude is in charge of delivering the ransom. Soon, thanks to Walter's meddling, the two end up without the money and with everyone after them.<br />Strangest of all, I left with the impression that this film is fertile ground for a message. Any sort of message. &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; has all the right ingredients, all it really needs is some seeds of commentary, cynicism, comedy, sarcasm, anything, really, and it would be a fantastic film. As it is, it dies on the screen. I literally evaluated every scene to see whether there was anything in it worth laughing at. I doubt I fulfilled my mental quota (though, in any case, the very fact that the movie generates such an attitude is hardly a compliment).<br />There are two good scenes in the movie, however, both dreram sequences: in one, Lebowski soars through the air after theives flying away on his carpet; in another, he dreams of a bowling musical, complete with bowling pin dancers and a valkyrie.
B00000K0DU|3.0|If you've seen any of Lucio Fulci's films, you know that this is a man who doesn't care so much about the plot of the film he's making so much so as shocking you into a traumatic state with all the gore-effects he throws at the screen like a splash painter with a brush full of paint. The screen is Fulci's canvas, the blood is his paint, and you can never tell quite what you're looking at, but you know it's disgusting in a lot of parts. Fulci's other films (that I've seen) include &quot;Zombie,&quot; &quot;The Gates of Hell (City of the Living Dead),&quot; and &quot;The Beyond.&quot; The latter is the best film I've seen from the director, but this one I would rank right underneath it, mostly because it does exactly what it sets out to do, it disturbs us with its gore-effects, and it's endless brutality against women. The other Fulci-isms are there, too: An eyeball gag, tons of gratuitous nudity, and point of view shots we'd rather not see (in this case, a woman's erogenous zones looking down a broken glass bottle, but we'll ignore that for now so I can type without littering the screen with my vomit).<br />The plot of the film is very simplistic, like any cop caper you see on TV at two in the morning on USA: A sadistic woman-killer is on the loose, cutting up women in the worst possible ways, and one cop in particular is the target of this guy's affection. One cool little nuance in the film: The killer sounds like Donald Duck. There's not really a whole lot else to say. This is a movie that doesn't thrive on the details of plot as much as it does on Karo Syrup, which poors out of sliced orafices in abundance. But there is an issue here that's going to deter women and any woman-respecting male from wanting to sit through this movie: It is absolutely, 100%, relentlessly brutal towards women. Every murder sequence is shown on screen in elaborate detail. There is almost nothing left to the imagination. Fulci doesn't cut away just as things are getting their worst, and if he does, he always cuts back right in time for the blade to cut across a part of the woman's body that will have audience members clutching assorted body parts. This is an exploitation film, as well, using a New York City sex house as a backdrop for one of the more corrupting sequences I've ever seen committed to celluloid. Nudity is virtually in your face almost every five minutes in this film. Heck, even the good guy has a prostitute, and of course, she has to walk around naked during the cop's midnight phone call eating yogurt or something.<br />Pubescent boys will love this film and its gore. Women will never go out with the guys who don't squirm. This isn't for everyone by any means; Fulci never made a movie that was, but in terms of disturbing violence and above-average gore-effects, in essence, everything a Lucio Fulci movie stands for, this one delivers for his fans.f he does, he always cuts back right in time for the blade to cut across a part of the woman's body that will have audience members clutching assorted body parts.

B00005JKHP|2.0|This film is very special to me... I feel that it is the most cinematic of all the Trek films and I attribute that to Robert Wise's direction.  But I am so very disappointed in what he and Paramount have done to this film.<br />Good things: The disc is anamorphically enhanced and some of the shots, particularly the interior shots in the later part of the film, look excellent.  A few of the new effects shots are improvements over the old, especially the scenes of the landing party leaving the ship and walking out to V'Ger's central core.  And that's about where the improvements end.<br />The majority of the optical shots are plagued with noise and negative dirt.  This transfer needed a dirt fix session before it was pressed and I cannot imagine how this disc was let out with the condition some of these shots are still in.<br />Regarding the audio re-mix, it is not that impressive, and many new sound effects were added; they are so crisp in quality that they do not match the laid-back quality of the dialogue and score -- these audio effects weren't broken so I don't know why they were modified.  Especially unacceptable is the new &quot;Red Alert&quot; klaxon sound.  Why, why would they replace such a cool noise with a cheap Casiotone alert effect?<br />Some of the editorial re-cuts I just don't agree with.  I have seen the extended version and the 1983 TV versions of this film, and worthwhile scene extensions in those earlier versions have been excised.  Other scenes have been inexplicably shortened, damaging the scene in the process.<br />One last beef: The graceful opening titles have been replaced by &quot;1987-era gold-tone type meets After Effects horizontal blur.&quot;  Completely unwarranted.<br />Save your money, it's not worth it.  The people behind this reissue just don't get it.<br /> I'll be watching my LaserDisc...
0385505833|4.0|Christmas won't be the same this year for the Krank family. With their daughter Blair gone with the Peace Corp, it just seems pointless. So Luther and Nora decide to skip Christmas, just for one year. No parties, not presents, and not a single Christmas card will be sent out. Instead, a cruise to the Caribbean is on the plans. In &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot;, Grisham once again leaves his main genre and takes us through the Krank's life leading up to not celebrating Christmas. But when the unexpected happens, the Kranks are forced to celebrate Christmas and learn some things in the process.<br />From diets, to some-what nosey and concerned neighbors, this is a delightful, fun book.  I gave it four stars because I felt it could have more substance. It reads like a quick paced time line, with little detail and doesn't take but a day to get through.  But don't let that fool you, it is a charming little book that I'm sure will be around for Christmases to come. Good job Grisham!
B00005QG9J|5.0|&quot;Morning View&quot;, named after thier new house and street which was the setting and inspiration for this album, is a very cool relaxing soft album. Quite a difference from &quot;Make Yourself&quot;.<BR>. &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was a more harsh, loud album than &quot;Morning View&quot;, but MV does doesn't completely change,<BR>it is just a little bit more soft in lyrics and melody. It does however stay the same in the bands way with words. The lyrics are fairlyn poetic, kind of strange but still getting their point<BR>in. &quot;Wish you were here&quot; creates a setting of a beatiful beach(which makes sense considering they live on a beach and surf alot) where in a first glance of the scenery, lost in a moment, he's happy. That's my favorite song on the album, but thier are some more really good songs on it. All though a step from &quot;Make yourself&quot;, this album may be an experiment with thier music, but it's only making the band stronger.
0375703764|5.0|I finally finished this work after setting it down and picking it back up innumerable times while engaged in other activities along the way - including reading other books and travelling.<br />There is certainly nothing else like it. Beautifully written in a manner both scholarly and exciting, HOL grabs your mind and pulls you into one of the most bizarre escapades ever imagined.<br />The number of footnotes is as infinite as the esoteric references, which to readers like me isn't much of a problem and very frequently a joy.<br />I didn't so much care for what was happening to each character as I was enraptured with time and time again getting caught up in the whole diversion of the writing and the palatable nature of reading this book the way it was designed, textually and visually.<br />The book is encyclopedic in its scope and masterfully written, which easily overrides concerns of bombast in design.<br />I am not sure with whom I'm more impressed, the author for creating such a magnum opus, or the reader who undertakes a no- less monumental task. The beauty is the sneaking suspension that this is exactly what said author intended, among a zillion other things.<br />Thanks for the journey!
B00005QDW5|5.0|For those of you looking for a compilation of your favorite Floyd I suggest you create your own. If you want to experince Floyd I suggest you buy this disk. Bottom line when listeining to Floyd is the experience. I got this disk last night and drove through the country letting the music wash over me, being with it and experiencing it. It was a joy to let this collection fill my space. I want to commend Pink Floyd for not making a chronological best of and making a new experience for those who love Floyd and those who will, thanks to this complation.
B00005QDW5|4.0|This is a good album for someone who doesnt have the complete PF catalog.  There is no reason for 4 post Roger Waters songs to be on this album.  Especially when: Pigs On The Wing part III, Mother, Run Like Hell, Young Lust etc....  were left off.<br />You can blame the record company and David Gilmore.  Roger Waters had very little to do with this album.  It could have been so great.  But because of Gilmores ego, and desiere to one up Roger Waters it falls short!
B0000062GK|5.0|Crystal Planet is almost as good as Surfing With The Alien!  It trully is a classic instrumental album.  It's amazing how a guitar can convey so many 'emotions' but in this album it really does.  A great mix between rock / funk and often beautiful ballads, this is a varied masterpiece.  Buy it!  If you like this album, try Surfing With The Alien, the Extremist and Steve Vai's Passion and Warfare.
078062789X|2.0|The haircut gave it away. Charlize Theron is Roseary a la &quot;Rosemary's Baby&quot; but instead of the Devil up to his shenanigans, it's an alien who gets her pregnant by travelling across space as a radio transmission and occupying her husband. <br />Johnny Depp is suitably vacant as the possessed spaceman. The movie riffs a little on female insecurities about pregnancy and the impossibility of men and women really understanding each other. It's a case of men being from Mars, etc. <br />There's little to connect to emotionally in the movie and this is not helped by the  director's cold minimalist aesthetic. This movie is as frigid as the regions of Nova Zembla, but now and then you feel a little heat like what is produced by touching ice.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Joe Satriani is possibly the most skilled of all guitarists I've heard of.  This album is sheer perfection, every song is jaw dropping.  Most of the songs even give me a shiver down the spine, it really is THAT good!  <br />This album is just one huge guitar solo!  It's fantastic, let's face it, the best part of a rock album is the guitaring, and this gets straight to it, it even forgoes the rubbish like actual vocals!  It's a guitar lover's dream.  <br />I cannot praise this album enough, if you want to get into instrumental albums, this is the place to start.
B000002RXS|5.0|With Callas, one gets the sense that they are actually hearing the character Bizet and Merimee created: a proud, sensual gypsy. With so many other opera singers, we get a prettily sung generalization of the character. Others may have more vocal sheen, but with Callas the character comes alive as in no other recording. <br />Sonics and supporting cast are quite good. Gedda is a sweet-sounding Don Jose; not as interesting as his leading lady, but a beautifully sung portrayal. Guiot and Massard fill out Michaela and Escamillo very well. It's a strong cast by any measure. But the real reason for getting this set is Callas. She presents the character in a myriad of moods and colors so one can see why all men are so attracted to her. It's a shame the original opera comique version (with dialogue) was not in vogue at the time of this recording as it would have been fascinating to hear Callas speak Carmen as well as sing it.<br />I have several versions of &quot;Carmen&quot; which all have something going for them: Price/Karajan, Stevens/Reiner, Resnick/Pritchard, and Horne/Bernstein. But I find myself going back to Callas if I want to really believe in this fascinating woman.
0783226063|3.0|I have watched the vhs version enough times to know what scenes were cut out of the sci-fi version a few years back.  And when seeing the DVD, I figured it would be a full version and would contain everything from both versions.  Well, sad to say I watched in horror as I became more and more dissapointed.  Many key linking scenes were cut from this film and made it (as stated in an above review) confusing at times.  These key scenes were background history and other important fillins.  I recommend the vhs over this DVD anyday.  You will find it more appealing.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is her third and best cd. You may think Britney is showing her new style, if you have heard I'm A Slave 4 U. Weel, he only track on this cd that sounds like this song is Boys.The rest is the same as ...Baby One More Time and Oops! I Did It Again. My Favourites: I'm A Slave 4 U, Overprotected, Cinderella, Bombastic Love and Anticipating.<BR>Britney shows her best.
B00005QCVT|5.0|One of the things I can't seem to let go of after seeing &quot;Requiem For A Dream&quot; is how people can let themselves become victims of their own personal vices.  As terrifying it is to see one character try to escape reality by shooting drugs into an infected and rotting vein, I can't help but feel sympathy for those who seem to be unaware of how their addiction has imprisoned them.  The character of Sara (played memorably by Ellen Burstyn) is among the greatest example.  To watch a character like that change from a complacent, yet likeable human to what we see at the end of this film is nothing less than tragic.  What is surprising is how this movie doesn't turn into a celebration of drugs, but rather a stark and horrifying reminder of how habits (of any kind) can destroy the soul long before it destroys the body.  This is truly one of the best films this decade has produced.
B00005OM4N|4.0|It's always a bit embarrassing for me to admit I like Britney Spears. I'm 22 and most of my music choices are rock-critic-approved. But Britney cheers me up when I'm in a bad mood. I dance while cleaning my house and listening to them. They're just a lot of fun. I should also note that I really hated Britney for the first year she was around. She just annoyed the crap out of me until I thought &quot;hey, I grew up on Debbie Gibson&quot; and realized it was sort of silly to waste hatred on some pretty blond girl who got a record deal at 15 and doesn't know I exist. That said, to this day I only like a few songs off '...Baby One More Time'. It's just too gooey for me. I like almost all of 'Oops!...I Did It Again', and I like almost all of this new album. 'Britney' is hardly a huge jump for young Ms. Spears, but it is a welcome medium-sized one. She is clearly branching out and beginning to take some control; good for her. Whether or not she will continue to be successful is anyone's guess but if she continues to grow I don't see why she shouldn't. Britney can dance, she's starting to write some of her own songs, she's got guts, good instincts, great looks, stage presence, and an incredible work ethic. No, she isn't a spectacular singer- but neither is Madonna, Queen of Pop for nearly 20 years now. What they both are is great entertainers. And that is nothing to scoff at.<br />'Slave 4 U' is not so anthemic as 'Baby' or 'Oops' (the individual songs, I mean), and it's not the best song on the album. In fact, there are some who opine that it's the worst, while others- both critics and average fans- say it's excellent. Oh well. Takes all kinds. I do really like the &quot;dirtier&quot; direction it goes in; it's funkier than most pop. 'Overprotected' is one of several &quot;this is who I am, deal with it&quot; songs on the album, basically about needing space to make mistakes and figure stuff out on her own. Typically Britney. Good chorus. Contrary to what the title wouldlead one to think, 'Lonely' is a &quot;you suck&quot; song. Sort of like 'Stronger' from 'Oops!', but a lot angrier. Pretty ferocious for bubblegum pop. One of Britney's co-writes. 'I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman' was co-written by Dido, and the only true ballad on the album. Because this is my pick-me-up music, I've never been too fond of Britney's ballads on the whole- and each of her previous records featured several. They tend to highlight her limited vocal ability, and they are typically very generic. So this one suprised me, as it is undoubtedly the loveliest ballad she's ever sung but doesn't deal- thank God!- with love at all. Its title tells the story, but this is genuinely just flat out a pretty song. One of my initial favorites. 'Boys' is my second initial favorite. This one makes 'Slave 4 U' sound innocent. This is a come-on, period. That doesn't mean its bad, though. This is the one that most made me feel like dancing. Sort of reminds me of Prince. 'Anticipating'is early '80s disco! Very bouncy and joyful, very reminscent of Borderline/Lucky Star era Madonna. 'I Love Rock 'n Roll' is the mandatory cover and one of the album's few mis-steps. One thing- I can't help but occasionally laugh at the &quot;put another dime in the jukebox&quot; line. I cannot remember the jukebox ever costing less than a quarter, and since Britney's three years younger than me I seriously doubt she can either! 'Cinderella' is a slight twist on the title fable. The girl basically says &quot;sorry and I hope you have a good life, but I don't care how Prince Charming-ish you are because you took me for granted and I'm out of here&quot;. Cute song with another good chorus. 'Let Me Be' is a &quot;this is who I am, deal with it&quot; song. Doesn't really seem to be directed at anybody in particular and thus comes off as a general declaration of independence and self-confidence. 'Bombastic Love'- what a great title! It's so Celine Dion- and indeed the song is about movie-style romance. It doesn't even pretend to bear any resemblance to reality. The title is actually sort of ironic- it realizes how unrealistic it is. 'That's Where You Take Me' threatens repeatedly to become a ballad but never quite makes it. Has some sort of wind-chime and wind-up toy sound effect going on in the background. Reminds me of some of the lesser songs on 'Baby'. This is probably my least favorite song on the disc. Goo city. 'What It's Like To Be Me' is another &quot;this is who I am, deal with it&quot; song. A lot like 'Don't Go Knockin' On My Door' from 'Oops!', only written before- instead of after- a romance. You can kind of imagine that Britney (the character) learned from the boy dealt with in DGKOMD and is telling the next one ahead of time not to make the same mistakes. <br />The album is a bit short and would have benefited from a couple more tracks. But over all it's a solid effort with some nice changes to the formula. Lots of fun.
B00005O3VC|5.0|The words of a knight whose arms have been hacked off in combat never sounded funnier than it does in this film.  Despite one or two slow periods in the film, this is definitely a comedy you need to have a pulse to get.  The DVD specal edition has it's own little moments of humor as well.  Not only do you have commentaries from the members of Monty Python (above ground, anyway), but even subtitles in Shakespearean form (for the more high-brow types).  The second disc is where you'll find a shrubbery full of features, including sing-alongs and my prsonal favorite in this set, part of the film done with Legos (you know, the blocks you put together to make stuff that you may have played with during your kiddie years)!  For Monty Python fans and fans of insane and confusing comedy, this one's definitely for you.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I bought this because I got to listen to it for free on AOL the other night I think that they should do this more often. I like all of the music but when I got to the store and read the back I found out why. It is produced, Composed, and conducted by John Williams. He must be the greatest composer of classical music of our time. My favorite track is Hedwig's theme. It Just reminds me of the most magical place I have ever been.(other than inside one of J. K. Rowling's books) You can't go wrong with this Soundtrack.
0780020685|5.0|Being a fan of great epics,&quot;Seven Samurai&quot; is one that definitely fit the pattern perfectly.  It's long (not that it's a major problem in the first place), involves many different ideas (the dichotomy of samurai as opposed to farmers or peasants, the art of combat, and what it truly means to be honorable in a world that is anything but that), and involves many epic action sequences (such as the rain-soaked climax).  Ultimately, it's a movie that works on all ends, inspiring many  carbon copies, but they all pale in comparison to this brillant work.  The DVD itself is not heavy on extra features, which is fine by me.  The movie (along with a interesting commentary on the movie and it's creators) is padding enough to recommend this to film aficionados.
6300214354|5.0|After Airplane! the Zucker brothers made Top Secret, which is, in my opinion, the funniet movie ever made! The first time i watched it i cracked up laughing. The sheer number of sight gags is astonishing as the jokes just keep on coming. Val Kilmer, in one of his first movies, is excellent as 'Neek', the singer who can take off his underwear without taking off his pants. The bizzare gags include an underwater barroom brawl and 'What funny dog Poo?' and the halarious scene with the bull (you have to watch it). The Zucker brothers' trademark slapstick gags and crude jokes are executed better in Airplane (I am serious, and don't call me shirley) but Top Secret holds up just as well as one of the truly great comedies. I'm waiting for the DVD.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I thought Shrek was 1 of the 10 best movies i've seen. The DVD's features are incredible and it's just drop da mouth to da ground funny! Buy this movie today and you'll have made your day but thats all i can say!
B000003CMC|5.0|If this recording consisted of only the Mountain Jam, it would be worth the money spent.  To hear the final notes of Whipping Post leading into the Jam...to Dickey and Duane circling around each other as they head into the main theme of the piece...and then the amazing musical journey of the Jam itself...it's about as close to perfection that any band can hope to achieve.  About the only thing better is listening to both on the Fillmore Concerts CD in sequence, and you realize that these guys jammed for nearly an hour without a break.<br />Not that the rest of Eat a Peach lacks anything.  Blue Sky is a well-deserved classic, and just hearing the opening notes makes me smile every time.  One Way Out, Ain't Wastin' Time No More, Les Brers in A Minor, Melissa...it's like an honor roll of rock n'roll.  And then there's Little Martha, one of the sweetest, tightest, loveliest pieces Duane and Dickey ever put down.<br />If Fillmore East is the greatest live album ever recorded, then Eat a Peach has got to be the best all-around Allman Brothers album.  Talk about an essential album...this has got to be near the top of the list.
0679720200|5.0|The North African sun flashing off an Arab knife. The whole book has the feeling of being a delirium though a lucid minded one, in the same way Kafkas stories combined those two (usually) inconsistent qualities. The main character seems overwhelmed by the world. He is a kind of victim of circumstance. The circumstance of being on the beach when the blade flashed in the sun which he felt threatened by and perhaps misinterpreted but also the circumstance of living in a world that makes no sense to him. Like Kafka before him Camus uses remarkable experiences to show the ambiguous nature of existence on every level. The courts themselves are senseless, arbitrarily handing out judgements with no real understanding of what occured either on the beach or in the lead characters head. The courts processes do not lead to understanding, that is not even their goal in this book. Camus shows that it is more important for civilization to retain a certain semblance of order in the face of chaos than to really offer a true order based on any true understanding. A brilliant book. The stars may look down indifferently on what we do here on earth but that fact and this book just make you realize how tricky and important a thing order, and justice can be. Lacking any absolutes to go by man exists in a world he can only partially comprehend. It is hard enough to comprehend who we are and doubly difficult, if not impossible, to comprehend another human . All systems of knowing and judging are flawed. Though Camus brilliantly shows society trying to deny this fact. Society persecutes, villifies, what it doesn't understand. All in the name of order.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Not even a double CD can come close to getting the complete &quot;best&quot; of Pink Floyd, and for a band whose music translates so well as complete albums (Dark Side, Animals, The Wall), some purists will bristle at this collection of singles.  Also, while fans will be pleased to see so many albums represented, the selection of songs is sometimes curious.  But beyond that, ECHOES is a welcome collection of 26 tunes with a real unique arrangement that hops around from 1967 to 1994 almost at random... and yet really well.  Check out, for example, the psychedelic (yet relatively innocent) chords of See Emily Play as they fade into the trademark helicopter sounds of Happiest Days... or the back-to-back instrumentals of Marooned (obscure even for a Division Bell inclusion, but neat) right into the classic Great Gig... ECHOES has a great ability to showcase the three periods of Pink Floyd: pre-Dark Side, the &quot;fab four&quot; of Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, Animals and The Wall, and then the two excellent Roger-less albums, Momentary Lapse and Division Bell.  Even the normally-ignored The Final Cut gets a nod with Fletcher Memorial (why that song, and not the more digestible The Gunner's Dream or Not Now John?).  The inclusion of When the Tigers Broke Free, alone, (from the movie The Wall), makes Echoes an absolute MUST have for fans, even if the set does force feed us Barrett/pre-Dark Side era songs apparently at random like Jugband Blues (why two songs from Saucerful of Secrets??) and Bike (available on the extra CD in the 1992 Sine On boxed set).  Still, it is such a treat to pop Echoes in and just hear what comes next as the songs jump from the 60s to the 90s to the 70s to the 80s.  The album does a good job of getting plenty of must-haves in, like Comfortably Numb, Money, One of These Days, Wish You Wer Here, and Another Brick 2... though putting these Floyd 101 tunes on the same album as Astronomy Domine (great open) and Sorrow (great close to CD 1) is a realenjoyable culture shock varying from overplayed to rarely-heard tunes.  Everyone will have their list of &quot;What about?&quot; songs missing from the set (my list includes Take it Back, One Slip, Welcome to the Machine, Green is the Color, and Run Like Hell). The amazing Animals set is once again represented by the time-efficient Sheep, (as on A Collection of Great Dance Songs) but Dogs is better!  Still, after 7 years without a studio release from these guys (and nearly 10 years without a new Waters album), it was great to something Floyd on the shelves, and nice to even HAVE a new set list to debate.  With a band like Floyd and their large arsenal of great music, not even a double CD will please everyone perfectly.  Yet this is all timeless music, and therefore, even the scattered arrangement gets my highest rating.
B00005QDW5|3.0|The Good:<br />The sound quality. It doesn't get any better than this. Best sound on the '67 material I've heard.<br />The Mixed:<br />The running order and the cross-fades. First, not all the songs are cross-faded, which is good - <BR>I was really wondering how some of the songs would work that way! The cross-fades on Disc 2 work better overall than the cross-fades on Disc 1. While most of the ideas are OK, they have a tendency to make the fade a little too abrupt - they could be more gradual in spots, like the transition from &quot;Keep Talking&quot; to &quot;Sheep&quot;. A couple of the transitions are awkward, like from  &quot;See Emily Play&quot; to &quot;Happiest Days&quot; - while technically OK, it really just doesn't fit musically. Similarly, going from &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; to &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, while quite proper thematically, doesn't really work musically; and the fade from &quot;Jugband Blues&quot; into &quot;High Hopes&quot;, while aurally satisfying, is in fact quite inappropriate musically IMHO - I think there has to be a break of silence after &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;. I also find it hard to accept &quot;Echoes&quot; in the middle of a set - it has to be either at the beginning or the end. I would have put it at the end of Disc 1. Also, while putting &quot;Bike&quot; last has many connotations which should not be forgotten, it would still be a lot stronger musically to end on &quot;High Hopes&quot; - put &quot;Bike&quot; somewhere else. Oh, and the echo at the of &quot;Us And Them&quot; has to go!!<BR>As far as the selection, this package is definitely aimed (in theory) for the casual fan, not the connoisseur. As one who falls in the latter category, I believe that there are many good choices and many &quot;why this, not that?&quot; choices. My personal number one in the latter category is why &quot;Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; to represent The Final Cut? &quot;Not Now John&quot; or &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (the song) would have been a far stronger choice IMHO - even &quot;The Gunner's Dream&quot; is better than this one! But that can all be argued another day.<br />The Abominable:<br />But here is where the adrenaline rises, where the fist of death seeks to be loosened upon the entity that did the final mix. Now, some cuts aren't all that horrible; while I would prefer the entire ending of &quot;High Hopes&quot;, the fact that they shortened the long solo at the end by 30 seconds (or cut the first 15 seconds off the opening bird sounds, for that matter) isn't devastating. But...<BR>Marooned. It is cut in half - it is the regular version, but fades out 2 minutes (less than halfway) into the song. and it isn't at any natural place - it is as the piece is building. Now Marooned wouldn't have made my own list, but if you are going to have it, have it! Why this fragment? I don't see the point.<BR>But all this fades compared to what has been done to the two greatest epics in the history of Pink Floyd, Progressive Rock, and music in general (well...). What has been done to Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Echoes is beyond comprehension.<br />Shine On is bad enough. The second guitar lead of Part 4 (the one just before the vocal) is cut, but that's the way we've been hearing it live for years, so it's not all that disturbing. The transition from Part 5 to Part 6 is OK, though I would have not let the entire Part 5 fade-out occur begin starting to bring in the Part 6 bass and wind. But then a TOTAL BLASPHEMY occurs - THEY CUT GILMOUR'S TWO SLIDE LEAD VERSES TO ONE!!! They take the first half of the first verse, then join it to the second half of the second verse. The result is you miss half of Gilmour's most signature slide leads (along with the end of One Of These Days). I screamed. The song fades out after the last vocal, segueing into &quot;Time&quot;. A good segue, but it doesn't matter. 'Tis intercoursed!<BR>BUT ECHOES IS WORSE!!!!!! This is what is cut from Echoes, the song they had the chutzpahto have as the title track for the collection:<BR>- The guitar lead before the first vocal<BR>- The second half of the guitar lead before the funk section<BR>- Part of the organ funk intro (cut from 12 reps to 8 )<BR>- MORE THAN HALF OF THE SEAGULL SECTION<BR>- MORE THAN HALF THE SPACEY WRIGHT-DOMINATED SECTION leading into where the rhythm comes back in<BR>- Cuts the build-up from the return of the rhythm to where the loud guitar riff comes in from 8 repetitions to 5<BR>- CUTS THE LAST TWO GUITAR SOLO VERSES AFTER THE LAST VOCAL<br />There are no curses that can apply to this abomination.<br />One other thing - would I recommend it for the casual fan, given what they are more likely to be concerned about and interested in? Truthfully, I don't know. It might be a little too odd for the mass market, while definitely way to K-Tel - like for the true fan. Overall, a messy end to a great band's career.<br />Jeff
B00005OM4N|1.0|Well, I have to say that yes this is her best cd to date. But that isn't saying much. Britney Spears is a packaged girl who is now complaining about how she is so &quot;overprotected&quot;. I'm sorry but the girl goes around in little to nothing infront of her fan base (13 and under girls and 35 and older guys). But still this is her best work to date, as to quote a friend after she had listened to the album: &quot;I like the voice they created for her.&quot; (to bad the voice is only 1 octive). The best stand out songs are &quot;I'm a slave 4 U&quot; and &quot;Overprotected&quot;. Anyone who is an *NSYNC fan will surely pick up on the &quot;me&quot; song in the song (listen to &quot;It's gonna be me&quot; and listen how Justin sings the &quot;me&quot; and you'll understand). I doubt it will win her a grammy or too much respect, but the cd will satisfy her fans, atleast untill they all grow up alittle.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Stunning graphics, loud booms, a hot lead star, and an over riding love story; sound like another movie...say Titanic? I thought so too. It starts out kinda weird, leaving you to wonder..um did i stumble into the wrong theater? Is this a chick flick with the whole love story thing, but then it's like all of a sudden it's like the writers remember, oh yeah there's a war going on, then it's like on man we forgot to end that whole love story thing, then it's like well let's drag it out abit, then BAM!! tadah! the end..leaving me to say uhhh ok...
B00003CXB2|5.0|T.E. Lawrence was perhaps the first perfect example of a mass-culture hero to come out of the First World War. The English soldier, writer and adventurer went by several names, but history remembers him as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. By taking an honors degree from Oxford in history with a thesis on Crusader castles, an ambitious project that required extensive field work in remote regions, he was able to examine three dozen Crusader castles--an achievement which prepared him very well for service in the Middle East by 1916. In the process, Lawrence conceived a romantic admiration for the Arabs during these archeological expeditions and learned Arabic while a student in Oxford.<br />It took almost two years to finish filming director David Lean's epic masterpiece. And this will always be better seen on a wide screen. There is no substitute for it, however seeing this on DVD in an HDTV capable widescreen would be a close second. I just have to have this film on DVD even though I have this in VHS, and what a difference. One can almost feel the shimmering heat of the sprawling desert sands and cinematographer Freddie Young (one of seven Academy Awards) captures flawlessly the sprawling sands of the immense Arabian desert. It is a place that can only be conquered by those with the right fortitude of body and mind, and in the film Peter O'Toole (as Lawrence) demonstrates (or should one say--showed off) the necessary stoic capacity to endure pain by snuffing out lighted matches with his fingers on a regular basis, without wincing. In campaigns in the desert, Lawrence inspired his men with his willingness to share their extreme hardships, and fought on even after being flogged by the local pederastic Bey in Dera (played by Jose Ferrer), and perhaps because of that incident, it transformed him into a more complex man. By showing how he transformed a motley gang of tribesmen  into an effective guerilla force and becoming the chief strategist for the whole Bedouin army, temporarily converting its self-interested leaders to his vision of a unified Arab nation---will probably be the single most redeeming quality of this great film. He did not hesitate to castigate his Arab cohorts like Sherif Ali Ibn El Kharish (played by Omar Shariff): &quot;Sherif Ali, so long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe, so long will they be little people, a silly people--greedy, barbarous, and cruel, as you are.&quot; Beyond question was his crucial role in driving the Turks from Syria and western Arabia, the centerpiece being their capture of the Turkish fort of Aqaba, by crossing the Nefud desert and capturing it on the landward side--a thing considered impossible by the Turks in those days (which shows why their big guns are all pointing out to sea). It is just one of the spectacular scenes  in this film.<br />Loosely based on Lawrence's &quot;The Seven Pillars of Wisdom&quot; (published in 1926), an abridgment came out later as &quot;Revolt in the Desert&quot;, it showed, as in the film, that he was a man of action who felt defiled by his actions, and a soldier painfully conscious of being an agent of British imperialism. He was a writer eager for fame, but he was psychically devastated by the war's horrors and its betrayal of his ideals. Lawrence, perhaps more than anything else embodied the dissolution of British class heirarchies in the ordeal of war. After the war he received a number of honors and was offered but refused the Victoria Cross and a knighthood.<br />Though it never tried to explain why he was impelled sometimes to embellish his achievement and then repudiate the fame they offered him, this is one great film about one chapter in the life of an enigmatic and complex man. Perhaps that will always be Lawrence's legacy.emporarily converting its self-interested leaders to his vision of a unified Arab nation---will probably be the single most redeeming quality of this great film.

B000002KKC|3.0|After reforming for a second time, adding California songwriters, Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to their line-up, Fleetwood Mac became one of the biggest bands in popular music with their 1975 self-entitled album and then the biggest with their 1977 megahit, Rumours. They attempted to keep their crown with 1979's Tusk. Like Physical Graffiti from fellow 70s supergroup, Led Zeppelin, Tusk is a double-LP, where everything the band attempted, from their wackiest moments (the incoherently bouncy \\"The Ledge\\") to their utmost triumphs (the intimate \\"Storms\\") was added to the track listing. Likewise, listening to Tusk is a process of picking and choosing. Some tracks, such as the aforementioned \\"Storms\\" can not be missed. \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" finds Buckingham's downbeaten sentiments recoiling against rambunctious keyboards. The tribal title song may be drummer, Mick Fleetwood's finest moment. \\"Think About Me\\" and \\"Angel\\" find big Mac channeling the strutful form of pubrock that made \\"Say That You Love Me\\" one of their self-entitled album's best songs. If is possible for a singer to be both gently sweet and achingly haunting in the same breath, Nicks pulls it off with \\"Sara.\\" Other tracks are less remarkable. These are the ones where one of the band's songwriters goes on autopilot. Buckingham's moany \\"Save Me a Place\\" and \\"Walk a Thin Line,\\" Nicks' witchy \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" and Christie McVey's sappy \\"Brown Eyes\\" and \\"Never Make Me Cry\\" are exactly what you would expect of each songwriter. Still, even when it is dull, Tusk continues to show Fleetwood Mac's fine ability to create a cohesive whole while compiling the work of three very different songwriters. It is uneven, but Tusk is a respectable way for Fleetwood Mac to close the decade that brought them to the top.

B000000W5L|2.0|The Rolling Stones' Exile On Mainstreet is the most absurdly overrated album in rock history. There is nothing overly special about this 1972 \\"classic.\\" The Stones effectively pilfered the styles of BB King or Buddy Guy and repeated the process eighteen times. Some tracks such as \\"Torn and Frayed,\\" \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\" are fine on their own but the album as a whole falls flat, weighed down by a tedious repetition of murky, southern draws and generic, unexciting blues riffs. It is a decent album when compared to those of lower ranking British blues bands such as Ten Years After or Herman's Hermits but there are many more capable and radiant LPs in rock's arsenal deserving of Exile's rank in the classic album hierarchy.
B000007R13|4.0|The Allmans' LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST was two thirds of a great set of live performances(the rest found on EAT A PEACH)and a wonder of(seeming)improvisation and perfect/imperfect musical telepathy.  What was amazing about LIVE is how long tracks could sound so short--the band moved instruments and cadences, rhythms and little licks, played between and beyond themselves, diddled and juiced around--and still maintained continuity, never left a listener adrift.  Even on the lengthiest track, you always feel you're moving on a brief journey--like a car ride from your house to the supermarket(except that supermarket is forty miles away)--with very colorful landmarks along the way.<BR>   According to legend, the four-channel quad master of LIVE AT FILLMORE EAST was taken from a different night than that taped for the stereo Lp (which  is more familiar).  Maybe so, but the feel is no different: this was one very tight band, even when the rhythm section threatened to forget they had two Allmans to keep track of(and support).<BR>   While this album wasn't a sonic wonder, it sure is better than the original quad vinyl(inherently noisy and compressed).<BR>This does seem to be from that mid-70s four-channel master, as there is little in the way of a center channel.  No matter; DTS has put out more than a few of these, and despite the '5.1' designation, most multi-channel systems will give you enough center to keep you happy.  Most of all, this a pretty clean sound, surprisingly so; if there's a problem it's in the remote recording situation and the mixing limitations.  For these reasons the listener should take the overall sonics with a grain of salt, but it's not bitter. Like most vintage DTS audio discs, there is no comparison to the clarity and variety DVD-Audio(or recent DTS audio)provides, but this was 1971, after all.  For me, to have 1971 multi-channel without a lot of tape hiss or noise or compression is a gift. All we need now: DTS for EAT A PEACH.
B000002P5W|4.0|Where their 1967 debut, Are You Experienced vigorously stuns listeners, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's second album, 1968's Axis: Bold as Love tenderly dazzles. Three achingly beautiful masterpieces, \\"Little Wing,\\" \\"One Rainy Wish\\" and \\"Bold as Love\\" are the highlights of Axis. Hendrix's gently strummed electric guitar crown these tracks with an unsurpassed feeling of splendor. The rest of this album is slightly uneven. Some funky hard rockers stand up to those of Are You Experienced (\\"You Got Me Floating,\\" \\"Little Miss Lover\\") while some merely flicker (\\"Wait Until Tomorrow,\\" \\"Ain't No Telling\\"). Perhaps the most distinctive song is \\"If 6 was 9,\\" an undulating, grimy rocker that became Hendrix's mantra. Although, the electric warrior scarcely lets down his sword, Axis: Bold as Love shows new, tenderer dimensions to the deeply talented artist named Jimi Hendrix.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Shrek was truly one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Fantastic humor, excellent voice acting, amazing graphics, and some cool bonus features. Yes, the word &quot;damn&quot; is used twice, but most of the &quot;adult humor&quot; is secreted in catch phrases that would go right over younger kids heads. Don't listen to the people that gave it one or two stars: none of them have very good explanations for why they didn't like it anyway. Shrek is a movie that you and your whole family will love.

B00005JKHP|3.0|While there is mostly good in the new cut, there are also some wrinkles. Some of the editing decisions to improve pacing left out some of the interpersonal interactions and in some places felt choppy. I guess the risk here was changing a movie that many of us already know by heart.<br />I'm glad Robert Wise was able to finish this movie to his satisfaction and, I believe, ours.
B00005B4GU|5.0|radiohead is an incredible band. thats where ill start. and from the bends to kid a, they have just made one incredible album after another, while staying true to who they are. i think every generation has an artist who does it his or her way. and doesnt care what anyone thinks. its all about music. jimi hendrix to nirvana, and now radiohead. they are true musicians. but kid a and amnesiac have an unusal quality not found in music. it is human. it feels pain, and anguish. it wants to live and it wants to die. this music has a mind. the only thing giving amnesiac the edge, is the variety. not since the bends has a radiohead album had such a manic type of outlook. but amnesiac stabs you with confusion, emptiness, and a cry. thom yorke's cry. his cry to the world in his own pains, and his revelations that he saw. thom yorke had had a nervous breakdown at one point. and if this is a recap, then it couldnt hold more true and real to what it was. you feel what it is all about. no longer about beating your fist into someone's skull for no reason, or beating your woman cuz she slept with your best friend. and its not simpleton lyrics that tell about being happy. it is true and genuine. it is radiohead. amnesiac and kid a are two indespensible albums, whether you like it or not. get them both, or get one, whatever suits you. but both are filled with human emotion. that is what makes this band the greatest band of our time.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk, which I read as part of a collecion of stories called THE BACHMAN BOOKS by stephen king, is a fantastic novel which takes place in the near future.  There is a competition called the Long Walk in which teenage boys see how long they can walk without stopping.  Of course there is a twist: go under 4 mph and you're dead.  Because of this constant suspense, the book is hard to put down.  Not only is it a creative story, It has very touching moments and the ending is magnificent.  I recommend this book and &quot;RAGE&quot; By stephen king, which you can also read in THE BACHMAN BOOKS.
0441172717|5.0|are you a disgrace to bookahloics?  if you haven't read Dune then you are.  frank herbert skillfully weaves politics, religion, and for lack of a better word, magic into a suspenseful page turner that will keep you wondering for days.  but beware, if you are an impatient reader you may not like the beginning and be tempted to move on to a more face paced sci-fi novel but trust me, if you stick with Dune you receive a large reward.
B000059R8Y|5.0|'Reptile' is a fitting title for an album that could one day serve as a humble retrospective of Clapton's maturation as an artist. On the album, listeners find Clapton jumping from Jazz to Blues to Pop Rock and Gospel Twinged songs, all of which find Clapton's voice in fine form and his performances very honest and laid back. &quot;Laid Back?!?&quot; you think? Don't worry, he is still the guy who played on &quot;White Room&quot;, so it's not as if he traded in his Strat for a ukelele on 'Reptile'.<br />The album starts off with the title track, a jazzy number that shows off the talent of the band and the technique Clapton is capable of outside of the standard 12 bar blues. 'Got You On My Mind' is New Orleans blues at its best; hammond organ, slide guitar, sweet vocals. At this point, your toes are tapping. From there on in, Clapton throws you a few curves. After doing another J.J.Cale song that sounds like an airliner commercial, he turns up with 'Believe in Life', a rare original song on the album that has shades of Stevie Wonder's 'Sunshine of My Life'; ditto the senimental 'Find Myself', a song about Eric's beloved uncle that grows on you with each listen. <br />Beyond that, Clapton pulls out all the stops on Ray Charles' 'Come Back Baby', a Gospel/Blues number that shows off the gravely tone his voice has achieved; he no longer sounds forced when singing the blues. The rest of the album is pepperred with blues and jazz flavored songs that leave you in a good mood and significantly impressed with how fresh sounding the songs are. While the album was released without much fanfare (compared to Riding With The King or UnPlugged), it is truly one of the most complete of his solo career.
B000002LHX|1.0|I saw the movie Batman starring Michael Keaton on the big screen and later I recieved the movie on video as a present and I think it's ok, but I also got this Batman soundtrack and I don't like it, it's too weird! I don't like even 1 song on it, I have been trying for years to give away and get rid of this CD and no one wants it, I thought at least one person would want a free CD so they could build up their CD collection, but no one will take it even for free, everyone tells me I should just throw it out but I hate to waste things so I might try this new store near me that buys used CD's or lets you trade them.
B00005OAIE|3.0|Dave Matthews vocal wannabe??? (...) This is a great album, period.  In the day when popular music is suffering at an all time low, this new release from a REAL singer/songwriter is a very pleasant departure from the painfully bland music we are forced to hear anytime a radio or television is turned on.  (...)
B000002LIM|2.0|Well it's better than that horrible and bizarre Batman soundtrack from Prince but it's not exactly a favorite of mine, it's kind of dull compared to Danny Elfman's lively scores for Beetlejuice, and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. It's not a horrible soundtrack it's just a little too dull for my taste and the only track I like is the Batman theme itself!
B000002I27|5.0|The Doors second LP Strange Days was released in October of 1967.  The album is far darker and stranger than the group's massive debut.  Most of the songs were leftovers from the Doors first album making this weaker than thier massive debut but it does not stop Strange Days from being a great cd.<br />The album consists of several radio friendly hits like the cabarnet style PEOPLE ARE STRANGE, the blues rockin' LOVE ME TWO TIMES, the haunting title track STRANGE DAYS, and the poet rock flavoured MOONLIGHT DRIVE, It also contains several dark steps into pyschadelia with tunes like the eerie YOUR LOST LITTLE GIRL, the echoing UNHAPPY GIRL, the trippy I CAN'T SEE YOUR FACE IN MY MIND, the smokey rocker MY EYES HAVE SEEN YOU, the bizarre throw away poem HORSE LATUITUDES and the grand finale WHEN THE MUSIC'S OVER which seems to be a successful cross of THE END and SOUL KITCHEN or something.<br />Overall Strange Days is a pretty good album.  I actually gave the album 4 1/2 stars but I had to round up.  This album has some pretty good songs on it that many Doors fans will enjoy regardeless the fact that it's weaker than their debut.  Generally every song on this album is good except HORSE LATITUDES.  Highly recommended!
B00005JKHP|5.0|Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the second Star Trek movie I ever saw.  I think I am not alone when I did not understand this movie too well when I first saw it.  Now, when The Director's Edition was released...I can't put this movie down!  The reediting of the film created a much more enjoyable and understandable film.  All of the nonsense, annoying scenes and sound effects have been removed for a much more modern take on this film.  It was a great decision not to re-release this in theaters, the DVD is one of Paramount's best.  The effects were done in a way where the new added CG scenes blend in very well, unlike Star Wars 4, 5, and 6.  Still remember, this movie was made in the late 70's.  When you watch the film for the first time, or again, don't forget that it was the only Star Trek movie at that time.<BR>If you are a Star Trek fan buy it today with NO delay!  If you are interested in this movie...see this version, not the original or the television version, that's what I did.<br />Go Star Trek!
B000002I2G|4.0|To be perfectly honest I am really sick of seeing people bashing this album.  Sure I agree that the Doors 4th LP was not their best but it was definetly their most ambitious.  The band was very expiremental here.  Using brass and strings in the majority of the songs that appear here.  Some of these expirementations were successful some weren't but none the less the Doors made a decent album.<br />The huge radio hit TOUCH ME appears here which is probably the bands most successful brass experimentation.<BR>The hard rockin' WILD CHILD also appears here as well as to underrated tunes SHAMAN'S BLUES and DO IT.  The album opener TELL ALL THE PEOPLE is a good song but very pop-like by the Doors standards.  EASY RIDE is a fun song and WISHFUL SINFUL is a wonderful poetic tune.  RUNNIN' BLUE is an interesting experimentation to say the least but is definetly not the best song here.  The album closes with THE SOFT PARADE a four part musical journey<BR>which I think is awesome!  It is amazing how the band change from style to style of music so well!<br />Overall the Soft Parade is a decent album and a very respectable effort.  It is definetly not the best Doors album but it has some good songs.  If you are open mind give this album a whirl but be warned you may find this album contains tons of filler or tons of great music depending on your musical taste.  Thats my two cents on this cd, and remember in the words of Morrison &quot;You Cannot Petition The Lord with Prayer!&quot;  Mildly recommended but essential to Doors fans!

B00005BL2A|5.0|In this world of Britney Spears and N'Sync nonsense, it's refreshing to hear pop the way it should sound - with an edge!  Depeche style.  I think this is their most diverse album since &quot;Violator&quot;.  &quot;Ultra&quot; is probably my favorite along with &quot;Songs of Faith &amp; Devotion&quot;, but both of those CD's have their own unique &quot;mood&quot;.  The producer, Mark Bell, has done some fine synth work here.  Some of the highlights include &quot;Shine&quot; (gorgeous, warm synth tones &amp; beautifully sung by Dave), I Feel Loved (fantastic growling bassline and their catchiest song since &quot;Halo&quot; in my humble opinion).  I also loved the tongue-in-cheek industrial themed &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; and the experimental &quot;Sweetest Condition&quot;.  The whole album has a 1950's feel to the songwriting and I would highly recommend it to anybody - especially those of you who aren't really big Depeche Mode fans.
B00000J7JO|5.0|While this disc may not be the Chilis' rawest or most original, it is certainly their most listenable.  The album begins with four incredible songs, each upping the ante until the moving &quot;Otherside&quot;, the best RHCP song outside of &quot;Under the Bridge.&quot;  Other highlights include the title track, &quot;Easily&quot; (their most underrated song), and the haunting closer &quot;Road Trippin'&quot;.  Even the weaker cuts on the album, such as &quot;Get on Top&quot; and &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; have something to offer, whether it is a rousing guitar solo or a surprising crescendo.  The best album of the late 90s.
0385505833|5.0|With his newer books, John Grisham seems to be revealing more of himself.  Granted he's still writing fiction, but somehow you feel that he's sharing more of his thoughts as he goes through different phases in his life.  I love this book because it is feel-good, and the characters are so vividly described that I had to keep pausing throughout the book to imagine what each neighbor is like.  The book is also funny, and it's an easy read.  It's a great Christmas gift.  I'm eagerly awaiting Grisham's next book.

0486282112|5.0|This is one of the most misunderstood and underappreciated works of fiction in the English language.  EVERYONE should read it- it's very short,very readable, and a really entertaining story.  You THINK you know the story from the movies, but it's actually quite different. Frankenstein's monster is not the lumbering lummox the films make him out to be- rather, he is articulate, sensitive, and as soft-hearted as he is embittered. The central philosophical question of the book is whether or not the \\"monster\\" (or, as Shelley referes to him, \\"the fiend\\") is really human. The question of the creature's humanity is muddled by the fact that he is entirely rational and seems to have a well-defined sense of morality, although his morality might not be shared by all the readers. Some will argue that the creature is indeed human, other's will argue that he is merely a sociopath created out of the remains of formerly human souls and is therefore more or less an organic robot. A lamentably short read, this story will stick with you and will forever change your opinion of the hollywood version of this monster.  This edition is dirt cheap, so you can't afford NOT to read it!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I just wanted to say that this DVD is the best presentation of &quot;citzen kane&quot; I could ever hope to have.  It's presented in its original aspect ratio (which is NOT pan and scan, it's full frame). The Picture is absolutely beautiful.  The sound is richly presented in its original mono.  Thank god no &quot;5.1 ehnancement&quot; was applied to ruin it. I mean really, that would be like going back to the Mona Lisa and making it more colorful.  This film is the Mona Lisa, and this is the best lighting in which to see it.
0805062971|5.0|What else can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? You must read it. Steal, borrow, or buy a copy. Just read it.
6302610702|5.0|Probably the best saga in fil ever ever ever. The first was a masterpiece, enough said. The second, perhaps not as good as the first, but still counts amoung the best of all time. The third and final film was for me the worst of the trilogy, but that said, it wasn't by much at all, its an excellent ending to the saga and still a cut abouve pretty much anything else thats been released over the past few years.
B00005JKHP|3.0|...yet the most uninteresting movie in the series.<br />The script. I hadn't seen this movie for a very long time and didn't remember much of it, just that it seemed very slow. But having seen it recently I can't believe the script. To go through the detail they went through on set design only to shoot almost an identical &quot;TV SHOW SCRIPT&quot; is odd to me. This story is a cross between the &quot;M5 Computer&quot; and the &quot;Nomad Probe&quot; needless to say, it's been done. I wonder why no one mentions it?<br />The cast. The chemistry is off and the additions to the cast are fairly weak. The way the dialogue is written is largely to blame here.<br />The sound. Finely a strong suit. Wow, this is a great s/t, and really sets the stage for further movies and TV shows.<br />The transfer/effects. Ahh, dvds are perfect... right? Not in this case, there are many &quot;glitches and scratchs&quot; on the actual film. When the scratches are not there the movie really shines, however about every 10 minutes or so you seeing a bit of imperfections here and there. This is the best looking film in terms of details. In a way it reminds me of the care that was taken in the 1st season as opposed to the runaway abandonment in the 3rd. The other movies seem more polished and less attention to lighting was taken, to me this movie shows a much more realistic view of the evolution of Star Trek. However, to accomplish this really slows the movie down, so it's not without drawbacks.<br />The ending/extras. Predictable and only fueled to mediocrity by a poor script. Nice to have the commentary, generally informative however it only serves to highlight the lack of extras on any of the other films. Since Voyage Home was the highest grossing movie in the series, why no commentary on that one? The fans deserve it.
0790731002|4.0|It may not have Michael Keaton, but this is a very good improvement over &quot;Returns&quot;, Although not as good as the original, it definately delivers what it promised, Val Kilmer takes over the title role &amp; is surprisingly good, Jim Carrey is perfect as the Riddler, like Jack Nicholson's Joker, he is very over the top &amp; at times out does Nicholson's past performance, Tommy Lee Jones is also good as Two-Face, this film has a much lighter tone, there is comic book feel to it that is not overdone, the tone is just right &amp; Nicole Kidman is perfect eye candy as Kilmer's love interest, Carrey &amp; Jones play their roles to perfection as the villians who want Batman dead, the Batmobile is awesome here, even though it suffers an unfortunate accident courtesy of the Riddler, Carrey's one-liners keep coming as you can tell he was having fun, although this film had a troubled production, it doesn't show, &amp; is a feel good Batman that ranks with the original.
B00004Z459|5.0|Getting all philosophical here: Take Hegel's concept of the dialectic: There is one element, the thesis, and an opposing element, the antithesis. They combine to form a higher concept called the synthesis. How does this relate to Linkin Park? Take metal as the thesis and rap as the antithesis (pretty much opposites, right?) and combine them together and you have the synthesis which is Linkin Park's sound. <br />I am not a fan of rap or metal but as they are combined by this amazing band, it sounds awesome, its like they cancel each other out to form this sound that is of this world. It's raging, emotional, heavy and loud yet very musical. Angst and denial taken to a whole 'nother level in a very user friendly way. &quot;all it means to me will eventually be a memory of a time i tried so hard...&quot; (In The End) <br />Don't pass this up just because you are not a fan of rap or metal. I almost did, and that would have been a huge mistake.
B00003CXX8|3.0|The movie was OK- the previews described the movie to be so much more than it is, it seemed like a quickly thrown together movie, that really didn't have much suspense, maybe the movie would have been better if they would have cast a better actress for the lead, I mean Leelee Sobieski is OK I guess for a B movie, but if you want to make a movie to have an impression on people you need a stronger more serious person than her, I mean her acting isnt all that bad- but she is cast in all the wrong parts, I mean I just cannot see her as the strong heroine type, sorry Leelee.
B00005QK3B|4.0|may be the best Marillion's album. Melodies take you to heaven.<BR>If you like Marillion don't miss that one.
B00000J2SP|4.0|There's no question that when Ritchie Blackmore replaced Graham Bonnett with Joe Lynn Turner that Ritchie was seeking the breakthrough success in the U.S. market that had been eluding him.  While the earliest Dio-era Rainbow albums were definitely hard rock and the one Bonnett-sung disc showed more commercial tendencies, this first Turner disc shows definite radio-friendly touches (dare one call it &quot;pop-rock&quot;?)<br />With that said, one thing that has always impressed me about Blackmore is his ability to craft great parts for the songs he plays on.  While Ritchie isn't normally thought of as a great rhythm guitarist, his rhythm parts usually fit very nicely.  And his solos?  Well, Ritchie is definitely one of the best soloists in rock.  Even if he only gets 8 bars for a solo, he'll make a memorable statement.<br />While a lot of knocks are made against this record for its pop leanings, some people seem to forget the two instrumentals contained on DTC.  First is &quot;Vielleicht Das Nachter Zeit&quot; which is a superb piece featuring some great slide playing (for which Ritchie doesn't get enough credit).  The melodies so perfectly fit the mood of the piece, given the title.  When I first started playing guitar, I thought that this piece really demonstrated what &quot;speaking through a guitar&quot; really meant.  The second instrumental is a take on Beethoven's 9th symphony called, &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot;.  It's really a great instrumental and would be a long-time feature of Rainbow's live shows.  In fact, a version recorded with the Tokyo symphony appears on &quot;Finyl Vinyl&quot;.<br />In all, it's a poppier Rainbow but Ritchie still shines.  There's a lesson there, I believe.
B00004VVNC|4.0|Legends of the Fall was released in 1995 by Columbia/Tristar Studios and runs 134 minutes in color.  Edward Zwick directed a cast full of stars that included Brad Pitt as Tristan Ludlow, Anthony Hopkins as Colonel Ludlow, Aidan Quinn as Alfred Ludlow, Julia Ormond as Susannah Fincannon Ludlow and Henry Thomas as Samuel Ludlow.  Legends of the Fall won an Academy Award for best cinematography by John Toll.<BR> The movie takes place in the early 1900's in the \\"Big Sky\\" country of Montana and the themes involved are love, jealousy and personal struggle.  Legends of the Fall is a true epic in all aspects of that genre.<BR> Four stars is what Legends of the Fall receives for the beautiful outdoor scenery alone, but the acting also plays into that rating.  The characters seem very real and interact in such a believable manner with themselves and each other.  There is a definite admiration by Colonel Ludlow for his three sons, especially Tristan, the middle boy.  Susannah and Samuel have a mutual affection between the two of them and their love for one another.  Tristan loves his younger brother, Samuel, so much and wants to be his protector in every way imaginable.  He and Susannah also have an attraction between one another.  Alfred is,  believably, jealous of Tristan no matter what it is.<BR> In the beginning we see Tristan as a wild, spirited, free boy and is after a grizzly.  This would, in the end of the movie, decide Tristan's fate.  He grows into a young man, still wild, spirited and free.  His younger brother, Samuel, returns to their Montana home with his fianc, Susannah, and both Alfred and Tristan are taken over by her beauty, as well as Colonel Ludlow.  Susannah is overwhelmed by Tristan the moment she lays eyes on him.<BR> All seems to be right having all the boys back under the Colonel's roof, but then Samuel drops a surprise on all of them; he is going to go to Europe to fight in the war.  Colonel Ludlow is appalled at this and Susannah is extremely upset.Tristan vows to bring Samuel home safe to all of them.  All three boys go to Europe and fight in the war and, in front of Tristan, Samuel is killed.  This would weigh on Tristan's shoulders for the rest of his life.<BR> Once he and Alfred were back in Montana, Tristan and Susannah fall in love.  Alfred is very jealous of this and everything about Tristan.  Tristan is still wrestling with his inner being and that of losing Samuel.  He embarks on a journey overseas and is gone for many years.  When he returns, Alfred and Susannah have married and moved to town.  Tristan falls in love with Isabel Two, which is no longer the little girl he remembers; she is a beautiful grown woman.  They marry and have two children and are a happy family.  One day when returning from town, the police stop Tristan, Isabel Two and One Stab, Tristan's Indian friend and Colonel Ludlow's loyal Indian companion, and Isabel is accidentally and tragically killed.  About that same time, Susannah is unhappy with Alfred and jealous of Isabel Two.  She tragically kills herself and leaves Alfred stunned and alone.<BR> The last scene is back in the wilderness of Montana where Tristan is still fighting with his inner spirit and chasing the grizzly bear.  The movie ends with a blurry scene of Tristan fighting with the grizzly and finally giving into the spirit of the bear and himself.  This is a great epic that mixes many emotions and evokes many feelings out of its viewers.  One would get nothing but enjoyment out of watching Legends of the Fall and falling in love with the characters and the view of the scenery throughout the film.

0451169514|5.0|The first thing you think when you pick up IT is how am I ever going to read a novel that's over 1000 pages.  Then you open up to the first page, and your questions are answered.  From the first paragraph, when little Georgie is chasing his paper boat down the street, in the rain, to his undeniable death.  And from there, the novel takes off. Broken up into many parts, IT is Stephen King's masterpiece.  Strong, powerful stortelling, and without a doubt, his scariest novel.  The scene in which Mike is in the library, and Pennywise leaves him the baloon literally made my skin crawl.  Equally terrifying is when Ben sees Pennywise down by the icerink in the dead of winter.  Scary stuff, man.  Pennywise himself is King's most terrifying and best villian.  The idea to make a clown a mass murderer is absolutely brilliant.  We want Pennywise in every seen, and because he's not, when he shows up, we realize just how scary he is.  IT is one of the best novel I've ever read.  Stephen King broke barriers with this novel, and when you finish reading it, you'll know why.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Selling Out? What the hell is wrong with you people? You claim yourselves to be &quot;true incubus fans.&quot; I dont care if you have every one of their albums up to MV bronzed on your wall, you're not a true Incubus fan if you gave this cd 1 star. There's no argument. 3 or 4 stars I can handle, but 1 star is ridiculous. Incubus has come way too far to deserve only one star, no matter what kind of music they write. What's with this whole selling out deal anyway? Nowadays, all a band needs to do is write an acoustic song and theyre &quot;selling out.&quot; People were even claiming this with Make Yourself. How could they possibly sell out? Make Yourself is really what got them on TV. Just by hearing their music you should be able to tell that this is not a band that will decline and lose fans after the next few albums. Its you hypocritical poseur fans that wont accept the fact that people do change. Incubus = 5 people. Therefore, Incubus changes. Or maybe theyre not changing...? Maybe they want a little variety and unpredictability in their music... make things interesting...? Ever thought about that, you 1-star raters? Of course MV is totally different from other albums. No debating that. But Incubus is still writing brilliant music. If you dont think its well written, if you think there are flaws in the instrumental work, fine. But to say that Incubus has sold out merely because they are experimental, and trying new things while they still can is absolutely ridiculous. Incubus is nor underrated or overrated. They deserve all the credit they can get right now, and this album has sealed the deal. They have brought in many different types of music and rolled them into a Incubus type style. Brandon's vocal work is extremely versitile, the instrumentals are absolutely brilliant, and I can honestly say that this is the first incubus album that flows together as one. No skipping tracks here. Its perfect, from start to finish, with a great climax that urges you to replayit. At the same time this cd is very atmospheric, reminding me of Tool and even back to Pink Floyd. As those bands did, this cd puts me in another state, putting visuals in my head as the music flows with it. Incubus did an outstanding job with this album. Some of you people need to stop paying so much damn attention to how much time was spent on it, what songs are overplayed, what MTV has to play, which band members got haircuts, all of that nonsense, and just expand your horizons a little and enjoy incubus.

0811828697|5.0|Not only is this tome THE book of the year -- if not the decade -- for Star Wars enthusiasts (such as myself), but it will also go down well with biologists (such as myself).<br />Extremely well thought out, the authors draw parallels with animals found on Earth to make the creatures of the Star Wars universe realistically believable.  For example, the size relation of the nuna's egg to the adult female is also found in the kiwi, and the multiple embryos coming from that single egg are similar to the multi-spawning eggs of some parasitic wasps.  The similarities between banthas and elephants are copious, and the mouth-breeding behaviour of the opee sea killer will be familiar to any avid aquarist.<br />There are also many wonderful and enchanting \\"background\\" details in many of the drawings, like Bib Fortuna looking to purchase a Nightsister's rancor, an Ewok being carried off by a condor-dragon, and some Tatooine anoobas picking over the remains of the late podracer Teemto Pagalies (those are DEFINITELY his goggles).<br />The book is arranged in chapters by planet.  (Naboo has three chapters for its various macroenvironments: terrestrial, deep aquatic, and swamp.)  The ecologies of the worlds and the niches of the native creatures are all highly detailed and superbly explained.  Great care and effort was put into expanding the range of Star Wars wildlife knowledge, using conceptual sketches and some apparently original animals to flesh out the bestiary to a fantastic extent.  The images of the creatures themselves are -- and I have NEVER before used this term outside of describing food before, but it is now necessary -- sumptuous.  The people responsible for the content of this book deserve to win awards.  Lots of 'em.<br />Understandably, there are a few creatures which push the credibility envelope, such as the thrantids and practically anything over 40 meters in length.  But they're all still nifty, and even the mind-boggling space slug was given a decently credible internal anatomy.  And considering that here on Earth, there are bacteria which live miles below the crust, eat rock, breathe iron, and excrete gold, a little leeway for plausibility is permitted. };D<br />This would not be a Star Wars book review without the requisite (complaining) that any such work seems to engender.  So here it is.  The book's too short.  It would have been nice to learn more about the creatures that were marginalized, like the oft-mentioned but never focused-upon snapping bivalve nyorks of the Naboo swamps and the tiger-striped giraffe-like creature which appears in the endpapers and at the Coruscant Livestock Exchange and Exhibition; an animal which is visually arresting, but not even so much as named.  There are a few beasts in the size-comparison endpapers which do not appear in the text (which is a shame, because they look quite interesting), such as the fin-backed, tusk-jawed crocodile-thing at the front of the book.  While variant species of bantha, krayt dragon, thranta, mynock, and tauntaun were presented, it would also have been nice to see the differing forms of nerf.    Another whole chapter devoted to \\"exotics\\" such as Kowakian monkey-lizards, ghests, and the various types of gundark (only two kinds are shown, and only one of those is labelled as a gundark) would have been very well-received and worth the extra price such a section would require.  As far as mistakes go, I could only spot two: the rock wart described as an \\"unknown\\" species of worrt prey, and a representation of a Dug diplomat.  (Dugs are definitely NOT the diplomatic type.)<br />So, to sum up, any Star Wars library is woefully incomplete without the superlative \\"The Wildlife of Star Wars\\".  This is the best Star Wars book to come along in quite a while.  I could go on and on about this book, but I'll have to settle for summing up in four words:  BUY IT THIS INSTANT.
0440236304|5.0|Great book. The reader feels as though they have trained, jumped and fought right alongside with the author. As a veteran myself, I have learned that it is difficult to relate the 'detailed' war stories that people want to hear... except when talking to another veteran. A veteran never judges your thoughts and actions. Mr. Burgett treats the reader as another veteran and relates all the aspects of his war experiences. My appreciation goes to Mr. Burgett, his service and his writings. I plan to purchase his other books and read them in chronological order.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff buckley was the rare combination of a multi talented musical virtouso, whose many skills including excellent guitar work, great mellotron, and of course his incredible, acrobatic soft timbred, five octave vocal's, were matched with artistic vision. Jeff was an artist who crossed lines mixing up folk, rock, soul, gospel, and various other even more exotic influences, into a unique sound all his own that had the power to grab an audience in only the way a great artist can. Jeff's death is musical tragedy on par with the death of jimi hendrix.

B00005R62K|3.0|To be sure, `Stained Class' (1978), Judas Priest's fourth release, marked a distinctive point where the band became less of an inconsistent product of AOR influences of its time and more of a heavy metal band, defining its own musical path in terms of crunching power-chords.  Nonetheless, with the notable exceptions of \\"Exciter\\" and \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\", much of this record (as with much of `Painkiller' (1990)) is almost a self-parody.  To be sure, rock and roll is supposed to be silly, and heavy metal can be even sillier when it just doesn't work.  Here, the songs of alien invasion (\\"Invaders\\", complete with the sounds of landing spacecraft) and imperialist invasions (\\"Savage\\") just don't work.  Furthermore, the Spooky Tooth cover, \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\", seems like a very strange addition to this set.  That said, and considering the high regard this album was given by heavy metal historians, I would have to classify this as one of Judas Priest's most overrated records.<br />The bonus track (\\"Fire Down Below\\") is one of the better outtakes released on these reissues, but sounds a bit out of place given that it was most likely recorded ten years later.  The live version of \\"Better By You, Better Than Me\\" (circa 1980-1981) is not particularly notable.
0553573403|4.0|Okay, I admit it.  It took me quite a while to get past the first few chapters of this book.  I continually found myself rereading parts and going back to previous sections to figure out what the heck was going on.  The characters are many and the storyline is complex but once I FINALLY figured out who was who and where everything was at (the map in the front of the book is awful) I couldn't stop reading.  You know the kind of book I'm talking about.  Once you start reading you forget about everything (and everyone) else around you.  The only thing that I truely didn't like about this book was the character-centric chapters.  What I mean by this is that every chapter is centered around a different character and their adventures.  The problem with this is that as soon as I started to figure out what was going on, the chapter came to an end and I had to start all over with another character (very frustrating).  This wouldn't have been so bad, but it really put me off at the beginning of the book.  I need a bit of continuity to start off with and jumping around between a dozen or so characters made for a tough read just starting out.  Later, when I became accustomed to this writing style, I was further put off having to wait 100+ pages to figure out what happened to one of my favorite character (Arya).  Bottom line:  Plan on investing a bit of time to figure out what's going on but once you figure it out the pages turn quickly and the book is a good read.
B00005NWRS|2.0|I bought this because everywhere you go people are raving about the 2nd coming of Gram Parsons. I am not a convert. To be fair I have not listened to Heartbreaker or anything from Whiskeytown but this CD is marginal at best. There are 3 or 4 good songs here and 3 more mediocre ones. After that is a lot of filler. The big burning question is can this guy even sing? He is repeatedly mumbling words and his singing is questionable in my opinion. I actually thought a couple of songs were in a different language.
B00005R2IS|5.0|This is one of the greatest films ever made! If you had to say this film is about [REVENGE]. The story line is great. This film is way better the Death Wish.Mel Gibson was a great actor for this role. The best  part of film is when Mad Max drives about five insane bikers off a bridge.There were two seqels to this film. They are The Road Warrior and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.But the first one is best. This is truley a Cult Classic.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This box set really rocks.  I just got it yesterday locally, and mine came in a cardboard box.  It looks like it is also available in a wooden box, which I would have preferred.  Can anyone comment?  <BR>I never heard a great number of the tracks on this set, due to not being a collector of the individual albums.  But there is no filler here, just killer stuff.  If you buy one box this year, get this one.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Hit by a meteor shower, a transport ship carrying a violent criminal (Vin Diesel) crash lands on a barren desert planet. Survivors find remains of a colonized camp, but what happened to the survivors? When an eclipse turns the three sunned world to darkness, carnivorous beasts attack at night. This was as good a movie as the trailer promised it to be. Vin Diesel gives a powerful performance as the unlikable anti-hero who saves the others, though you're never really certain if he wants to save them or he just needs them to survive. Claudia Black &quot;Farscape&quot; is also in this one. Not as dark and morbid as the Alien movies, but good and scary with an uncertain survivalistic edge. It lends itself well to a sequel if done properly.
6304401132|5.0|Ever since I've watched this as Little girl, I've always remembered the waltz from the soundtrack, and it has always been my favorite waltz.  Now I've watched this again years later, I truely appreciate the beauty of its animation.  The background animation is constructed in such detail that it is almost a true art piece.  The movements of the characterers in the Disney animation have always amazed me.  The dancing steps and the movements of the three fairies in this animation are truely rhythmical.  This is a &quot;wonderful world of Disney.&quot;  I'll also try the Peter Pan.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The songs on this CD are great and also pretty funny. My favorite ones are &quot;In The Jailhouse Now&quot; and &quot;I'm A Man Of Constant Sorrow&quot;. The rest of the songs are also good too.
B000002UDD|5.0|Truly one of Megadeth's finest. Buy this along with Peace Sells, Rust In Peace, Countdown To Extinction, and The World Needs A Hero. This album has so many great songs some of them include Set The World A'fire, Mary Jane, In My Darkest Hour, and Hook In Mouth. A lot of people underrate this album. Many people say that it is no good. But I disagree this album has eight unbelievibly great tracks. If you like thrash you must own this album.
B00005NB0H|5.0|From one of the most compact, tight concert documents to one of the longest, Live at Leeds has had an interesting, and expensive (for me at least) history.  I bought the original album; I bought the import box set on vinyl ; I bought the original CD; I bought the remastered,expanded version; I bought the Japanese import CD; I bought the Mobile Fidelity version, now, of course, I bought the Deluxe Edition.<br />The odd thing is, I'm not complaining.  Sure, I would have liked to have the complete concert when they expanded Leeds in '95, but I really enjoyed that version.  The improved sound was a revelation.<br />They have certainly done a nice job on this Deluxe Edition.  The sound is, if anything, even better.  Unbelievable.  And I hardly notice the spots where Daltry has overdubbed his voice. The thing is, he really didn't need to.  I've got the bootleg of the complete concert and, though his voice is tired and at spots he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to reach the notes, it's not that bad or that noticable.  But really, considering he's now well into his 50s, his overdubs match incredibly well.  You have to listen closely to notice it.<br />Great to have the complete concert; great to have Tommy at Leeds.  Great to have this document from the band who, at the time, were the greatest band live, period.  Maybe the greatest band live, ever.  Not to be missed.
B000021YQV|5.0|I was a little afraid to get this album at first, because by the time I had decided to, System Of A Down had already dominated the metal scene and &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; was everywhere, the radio, TV, at school. I was apprehensive, because buying this meant I was jumping onto a bandwagon(something I hate doing). Well, it didn't matter in the end, and that goes for anyone who feels that way because THIS CD KICKS @-$-$! California has been a place spawning nu-metal bands for a while now, such as SOAD's peers KoRn and Incubus. However, SOAD has their own unique style, which really shows on this killer CD. I remember not really caring for their first CD, but &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; really grabbed my attention when I first heard it way back in August. Other awesome highlights of Toxicity are &quot;Science,&quot; which is a thrashy song with a Middle-Eastern sounding melody. &quot;Psycho&quot; is an equally fast song that deals with cocaine addicts. Surprisingly, the song ends rather melodiously, when, listening to the rest of the song, you'd expect a different ending completely. There are probably only two down points to this whole album:<br />1. Occasionally vocalist Serj Tankian's voice sounds so incredibly warped that you question the dude's sanity. This tweaked screeching mixed with guitarist Daron Malakian's odd high-pitched whining can really turn you off some songs.<BR>2. Many songs fall under the two-minute mark in length, not giving you a fair chance to enjoy the song before it is over.<br />Other than that, Toxicity is an awesome album, almost rivaling Incubus's S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and surpassing Korn's s/t. If you like thrashy metal with killer grooves and harmonious, melodic singing and guitar, buy SOAD's sophomore album, Toxicity. Heh, that's funny...listening to it, you'd think this was their 4th or 5th outing, it's so well done...
B000002KIE|5.0|I don't know who created your punk rock but my punk rock is in-your-face, political and filthy. The Ramones are creaditied with creating punk rock and that is right in some sences but I'd like to know how the Ramones were in-your-face, political and filthy? Because punk rock is all that and more. I've listened to both Ramones songs and Sex Pistols songs, to me the Sex Pistols sound more political and harcore where as Ramones sound more fast and popish-less political. It was once writien that the Ramones created and started the beat of punk rock where as the Sex Pistols supported that beat with a political message and that my friends is the truth. If it was not for either band punk would either too that mellow non-political fast rock of the Ramones or a hard, in-your-face, political orck of the Pistols. Both need each other to create the idea, philosophy and foundation of the greatest most creative music is history.<br />Thank you,<br />Mark the Canuk!
B00003CXRM|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time with my mom, my brother in law, my sister and my nephew, I was laughing so hard that I almost cried! I love to watch comedy movies and this is one of the best comedys that I've seen. The actors were funny and the whole story of this movie was fun and entertaining. Watch this movie! I bet you will laugh and have a good time watching it.
6301963717|5.0|After Jonathan Glazer's SEXY BEAST, the Coen bros.' Miller's Crossing is the best gangster film ever made.  Complex characters, brilliant story, and wonderful dialogue.  This is a pitch-perfect film about how gangsters are not always the smartest people, but that they are incredibly persistant.  Watch it!<br />Other great films from the Coens: Blood Simple; Fargo (if you're reading this review you've probably seen it); Raising Arizona; Barton Fink - See them!  <br />P.S. - All of Coen films are great.  The ones above are just their best.  See all of them if you wanty to see filmmaking at its best.
0871137380|4.0|Like virtually everyone else, I found this to be an extraordinary book.  In many places, I had to remind myself to breathe. But the question I constantly asked was:  what are we paying the CIA, NSA, DIA, etc., for? That's the most troubling aspect of the entire operation. How did these Rangers &amp; Special Ops guys get such poor intelligence about what the situation was really like, on the ground?  And how, with apparently constant aerial oversight, were they consistently mis-directed in an almost &quot;Keystone Cops&quot;-like parade through the streets of Mogadishu, under withering fire and an endless barrage of RPGs?<br />My biggest fear is that this same scenario is playing out in some dusty corner of Afghanistan, as you read this, and we'll only find out about it three years from now, after some tenacious newspaper reporter finds and follows a thread....
B00003CXRM|5.0|This was fun entertainment. The genuine bluegrass is amazing, and Holly Hunter gives, as usual, a gem of a performance. This is Ulysses like you never seen or heard it before. The siren scene. Cyclops, it's all here, but with a lot of laughs thrown in.
B00005JKHP|5.0|My hat is off to Mr. Wise.  He did an excellent job on this Director's cut.  This was one of my least favorite Star Trek movies.  The timing in the movie was very bad, but that's been improved a hundred times over.  The special effects are greatly improved.  And there's a few new scenes that really add a great deal to the movie.  Many of the not-so good scenes have been removed and it really keeps moving now.  Watching this DVD was like watching a brand new movie.  I also really enjoyed watching the three documenteries.  The third one really shows how much time and effort went into this Director's Cut.  This DVD is worth every cent.
0345347951|5.0|Of the golden age sci-fi writers generation, Clarke may be the only one who produced true literature.  His books are so finely written, so superby researched, and so subtle and dramatic that he set the standard for the best who were to follow.<br />Childhood's end is probably the best of his earlier books.  Clarke maintains a sense of mystery until the very end, titillating the reader with clues.<br />Without revealing the plot, humankind is visited by enigmatic space craft, perched over the major cities of the planet.  The aliens will not allow themselves to be seen and they let mankind develop more or less as it pleases, though subtly guiding it and rarely overtly.  While reading it, you feel the vastness of the universe and the wonder of existence, which sounds pretentious but Clarke pulls it off.  He also weaves in certain grand themes, such as the unity of apocalyptic visions in the major religions, the complexity of time, and the destiny of the human mind, all of which are inter-linked.  This creates a permanent space in the imagination of the reader, to be nutured for a lifetime.<br />Recommended as a great introduction to the world of sci-fi.
