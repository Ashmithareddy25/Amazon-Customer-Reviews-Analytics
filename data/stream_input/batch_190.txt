B005FYHCCA|3|i really love the tan eye shadow, very shimmery and the finishing powder. i give it a 3 because to me i was expecting a flawless look. who knows maybe its because i should've choose a tone darker than medium, maybe? the bronzer i thought was pretty light when i applied it. its did give me like a like a nice soft glow though so that was a plus. the mini brushes i thought worked fine when applying eye shadow and bisque. im willing to give this product another try when ever i decide to order the tone after the medium tone
B001QX70E4|5|Luv it
B000ALDK1A|5|Was very satisfied with this product and it lived up to it's claim on the site. Would recommend it to others. Really has relieved my itching dry skin.
B002RTVQNW|4|It's great because it works perfectly with my hair dryer and takes no space (which is important for me) and it's easy to pack it when traveling! Most hotels have hand-held hair dryers so no need to pack my dryer too - just the bonnet! I didn't rate it at 5 only because I wish the drawstring were a little bit tighter.
B001BLRYMO|5|Great Quality!
B00AEVP8QG|5|I used to get these from a friend who worked in a dental office and I thought they were fantastic. About the size of a credit card and easily fit in my wallet. They're great when you're at a restaurant or somewhere on the go where you wouldn't normally carry dental floss. Unfortunatey, my friend moved away but I luckily was able to find them on Amazon. For me, there's nothing worse than having something stuck between my teeth all day that I can't get out.  I highly recommend this product... totally worth it!
B00CF0X9HO|5|I am over 45 and have normal to dry skin that is beginning to feel the ravages of time.  I began noticing wrinkles under my eyes and around my lips yet was still having acne breakouts. In 2012, I began using Radiant Cream. I love the feel and scent of the cream, but the best part is that my skin has had reduced breakouts and my fine wrinkles are much less noticeable.  I highly recommend Radiant Glow Cream!
B0026DWB7Y|4|Very Very close to Martin De Candre. This lathers very well and smell decent. Like soap. Not too strong and it provide good slick protection on your face. The lather is nice and thick.
B00656NLEU|4|Not bad, Good Price, However it causes streaking if you dont apply it completely even.
B00CCUHA3G|4|I have been using this serum for a few days now & I can honestly see an improvement in my skin.  Pores are smaller.  Lines seem diminished & my skin feels very soft & smooth.  So far so good.  I will continue to use under my Sublime Beauty Day/Night creams.
B008MH93ME|4|I bought this from a local store on sale in the neon yellow. I've used it for about a week now and no issues, though I will update my review if there are. I have shoulder-length, relatively fine Asian hair, and the dryer has worked well for me. I haven't noticed it cutting down my drying time, but my hair isn't fussy, and I also usually let my hair air dry for about 15 minutes before blow drying it. I like that it comes with the attachments, and that there are several heat setting combinations. The long cord and the little loop to hang it is nice, too.<br />What I don't like about this dryer is the handle, something I wouldn't have identified until using this. My previous hair dryer was a smaller, fold-up travel one, and the handle tapered a bit where the hinge was, making it easier for me to grip it. This dryer has a nice velvety feel to it but it just doesn't feel right in my hand. I also don't like that the cool shot is just a button that you have to hold down, rather than a setting I can switch it to, but I can live with that. For the price, so far it's been a solid dryer.
B00H3WGN9K|5|This was the perfect gift for my sister who has everything!  She travels extensively and has used spa products from both domestic and international lines.  She is enjoying these soaps beyond measure and is planning to restock once the gift supply from her little sister runs out!  I think I scored a home run with Keomi soaps :)
B004CHMZX2|4|This is my go-to lotion. I know I'll always be able to get nice color and love the smell. No plateau issues, but I switch lotions a lot. This is one of the few I've purchased multiple times.
B0006OU078|5|I have been extremely impressed with this product. Was going to buy a clarisonic but don't think I am going to after buying this. Leaves my face feeling refreshed.
B001L9FZDG|5|I have been using this cleanser with the pads and lotion for months.  I use once a day.  I don't always use the pads, they don't seem to make much of a difference.  I thought that this wouldn't work at first because it had a smaller amout of the active ingredient in it.  It works wonderfully.  I haven't had any break outs in a while and my skin is baby soft and smooth. It has little scrubbing beads in it that exfoliate the skin. It's not as drying as other cleansers I've use with salicylic acid ( only .50% versus 2.0 % in most others) , yet keeps skin clear of blemishes.  I use the Daily correcting lotion with it.  It keeps the oils under control in my T-zone area.  I don't see any difference when I don't use the pads with it.
B001FS0HAY|5|I can see!
B00BQ1Z9F8|5|I'm so glad that I chose to order this product. This fits my Sonicare perfectly and I paid less than half of the retail cost for the name brand replacement brush heads. Shipping was great as well, everything was packaged securely and came in an incredibly timely manner!
B0075G7ZYG|5|I just love the color of this.This is not sticky or bad tasting. This lip gloss is a very good one. It also has a nice fragrance to it. I found mine at Walgreens for $7.
B001BWE90I|3|its ok, was hoping it would be more fun
B006GQYSGO|1|This is a rip-off! This will not even shave a hair from your face! And it hurts when try to make it do it! worst piece of junk ever!
B001NJ2CTE|5|Several in our household have been using this product for years and can't live without it. We were glad to find it is still available.
B000QE6U54|5|I really like it, some said it was sticky but I put a little water in it and its perfect.
B003MNL4R0|5|Love the product & it arrived quickly!
B0036B3C0A|4|This serum is good for the price. I'm not sure it was as effective as I expected. I needed a moisturizer over the top of the serum to combat dryness, but I expected that. The serum  goes on light and absorbs quickly. The bottle and dropper are nice. Overall, not a bad product.
B00008QQN2|4|This work very well with my husband as an alternative to an actual shower at the nursing home.  He likes them warmed, but if you are just wiping a face you can rinse it out with warm water and use it on arms as well.  There are no harsh chemicals in them and I believe they are calming.  A little pricey but when you are giving comfort - you bend.
B00JTMWTUO|5|These are absolutely the best stickers!! A must buy
B00QM2MINC|2|I had previously bought a shower foot brush through you but it was by another manufacturer----much better.  Although this one appears to be the same, the quality is poor--lighter weight and the brushes wore down immediately.  I would not purchase this one again!
B00346U886|1|It's way too thin that it didn't even hurt! But that's a problem bc when I pierced my navel with it, the actual jewelry didn't fit thru. I had to immediately use a bigger needle.. my friends one and that hurt a little. But over all I had to take it out bc when my friend did it on me I lay straight, bad idea bc it came out to be crooked! You should always mark it or do it by standing up maybe! So I decided to take it off and my piercing closed up completely healed no irritation in a week! Maybe in the future I'll give it another shot professionally! But these needles are way too thin. Waste of $$$. Give less needles but make one that's usable!
B00K04KPWY|1|These do not work at all. My manicurist tried to apply the sticker and it looked awful. Could not make it work following the directions on the package.
B0016Z3BA4|2|I was extremely pleased when the product arrived the day after I purchased it. Upon smelling the box, I was excited to discover that I enjoyed the unique scent coming from it. I immediately put it into my new burner(which is AMAZING, I highly recommend it):[[ASIN:B000VY9PS8 Skeleton Incense Burner Holder - Style 37078]] and lit 'er up. To my horror, a thick burning smoke type scent filled the room. I moved it to the living room thinking my room was too small- but now my entire house smells like it was recently on fire. These are definitely going in the trash or on the net for cheap. Maybe you'll like it, but my family and I don't.
B0098PRZ5Q|4|Nice to have a purple bag to go with my many purple ensembles.
B0069SQVK0|5|I think this works as described as a germ fighter.  I haven't been sick since using it and it smells okay too.  I recommend it.
B00THYBGAS|5|My hair is supposed to be here at 8pm I'm hoping is what I expect after reading the lovely reviews !❤️
B00FZ29ICO|4|This is a great product! It's nice to be able to have my house scented with NATURAL essential oils of my choosing (scents that aren't cancer-causing or are hormone disrupting, like all chemical/artificial scents on the market). I just put regular ol' tap water in the reservoir, four drops of some PURE essential oils of my choice (ones that don't have carrier oils in it 'cause that will clog the machine), and then I just turn it on! You can turn the Dew LiteMist on, leave for the day and come home to a wonderfully, naturally scented home. And there are no worries about leaving it on because it automatically shuts off as soon as it runs out of liquid to vaporize. LOVE this, product, the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it's sort of a modern shape... almost like a white Hershey's Kiss on your table, haha. If you have modern decor, this will fit right in, but if you have traditional / vintage decor in your house, like I do, it might stand out a bit. But this didn't stop me from buying it, per the other great reviews. I usually just hide it behind my desk clock when company comes or put it in a &#34;less traffic&#34; area. As for the colors, my kids (ages 4 and 2) really like to watch the vapor come out of the &#34;rainbow mister&#34;. ^_^ There is only one button on the device, which turns it on and off, etc. The first time you press it, it starts vaporizing the water and scent immediately and colors change after a couple of seconds. The second time you press the button, it stays on the current color. Press it again, the light is &#34;off&#34;, but you have a soft blue glow from the button. Personally, I just keep the color off, which is a great feature to have if you don't want to draw attention to the device. If you're gonna have this in a bedroom at night, it could be a good night-light. Even with the light off, it still gives that soft blue light from the &#34;on&#34; button, so it's not completely dark when you turn the light &#34;off&#34;.  All-in-all, very good product, wonderful, naturally scented home... I'm happy.
B003V37ZDS|5|Purchased it because it is supposed to be quiet.  It certainly is.  Product as advertised.
B000FCCKW4|4|Quick delivery. All condoms are lubricated.

B008DWSJ1O|5|Just wanted you all to know that your hair color is fabulous! Easy to use, great results. Love the packaging but feel bad about throwing it away each time. Your website is easy to use to adjust timing of order.<br />I tell everyone where my terrific color comes from and how easy it is to use eSalon and have it delivered right to my door.<br />Please keep up the good products and services you provide. Thank you to all the staff
B00JJOTAY0|5|amazing for the price.  Bought this brand when I was in Ireland, happy to be able to buy it on line
B00IR73TVA|5|I love the way this product feels and smells. My husband even uses the cream to help moisturize his dry skin. I use the ampoule first, wait for it to absorb, and then apply the cream. It even came with a little spatula! A very important step in my skin care routine.
B000I2S6JM|5|Couldn't find this locally, but here I found what I wanted (actually, better quality) at reasonable price.
B00GJG9JAQ|5|This product works great on my sensitive skin. The natural cucumber scent is amazing with no irritation or burning. I'm sold!!
B008SE7W2Y|4|I really like this wash and it keeps my skin clear, but the redness can be bad at times. Invest in a good moisturizer!
B00CWTYFVW|5|Love my Victoria Vanilla Spray!!
B0043L6DV2|5|I love These Needles ....I Will Only Continue To Use These ...I've Been Tattooing 4 Yrs And These By Far R The Sharpest Disposable Needles Around Fast Shipping And They Produce Great Results...Don't Hesitate...
B005C5FP9Y|3|out of all the canes that i received maybe 10 were pretty ugly. i guess not so bad, i did however had i hard time cutting them thin enough but thats just me maybe you will be better at it. i dont use them as much as i thought i would
B00AE07EIM|5|Only shampoo that makes my head not break out. Works very well and smells good too.
B00GTJS3F0|3|Not the best, but it is for a costume and it was cheap! It is kinda of bent out of shape and I had to do some work on it.  But it isn't bad. I probably wouldn't buy another one.
B004LG0DQK|5|I absolutely DETEST wearing dentures. I was not a candidate for a bridge.  I tried every adhesive. Nothing. so far,  comes close to EFFERGRIP. This is a secondary security to my snap -on over -dentures.( fyi- it leaves  the palate completely open!! it's just a small row of teeth. ) EFFEERGRIP  is  like cement or crazy glue.  You can definitely wear it a good 18 hours and even then, you have to pull it off. Also, you've got to remember that everyone's saliva is different. So, what agrees with me, might not be right for the next person. I am fairly new at this ...one year so far and I think it is definitely worth the try ! You have nothing to loose but your teeth!
B00EE9AD32|1|Got this brush, and used it after bath time, the next morning there were dark spots all over it, almost like it got moldy overnight!  Tossed it immediately.
B000PKZFFK|4|My wife loves this product it works great
B0014P8L9W|4|Kind of a pain to do and requires some work, and I haven't been sticking to it for this reason..
B00147V0PM|2|You have to wear these over night.  I like the trays that you insert and throw away.  It is only 15% but you only leave in for 15 minutes.  Overnight will not work for me, and doesn't seem safe, since I left the 15% in too long, maybe 45 minutes accidently and it burned my front gums, leaving them sore and white!  The green trays are great, just follow instructions
B007AKVLJW|4|Worked pretty good.  But I found that I like the stuff from Sally's better.  I believe it is their brand.
B004I2VYCE|5|Hands down THE best hair oil out there....it's light yet very effective. My daughter turned me on to this oil and I tried about 3 others when my bottle ran out....terrible. This Moroccan oil is the one you should have
B00EOMGZF4|4|woah there!!!! I love the &#34;Sulfur Mask&#34; ¡¡But not it's price!!
B005DKJRRE|4|Use this product before, is very good.
B001JKTTVQ|4|Ok
B00J2G5KCQ|4|They do the job. Good quality for the price!
B002BKGTGG|4|A nice purchase! works, gives a creative look, and worth the money, the seller deliverd quickly!!
B000SSDTTI|5|I would recommend this product - I am not a professional hair stylist, however, I style for my immediate family.  This tool gives me an &#34;Edge&#34; and my work is more professional looking. I highly recommend this product to professionals and home stylist.
B0014C6Q38|5|This is the best hairspray I've ever used. It breaks my heart that it's no longer available. Ojon...PLEASE bring back you original formulas.
B00196Y09G|5|I bought this as a gift for my husband. He seems to like it. When I asked him how he liked it, he replied &#34;it cuts.&#34; Enough said.
B004M46374|5|This face lotion is the best - it actually works at reducing shine on your face! I've been using it for years and love it. If you have an oily complexion, you won't be disappointed with this product.
B000C2333W|5|THIS ITEM WAS GENUIN A I AM HAPPY,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FROM SOME WERE ELSE AND IT WAS WATERED DOWN,I CAN TELL BECAUSE THE SMELL DID NOT LAST LONG AT ALL.I ORDERED FROM THIS SELLER AND NOT ONLY WAS IT THE REAL THING,IT WAS AT A GOOD PRICE.I WILL ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN AND TELL MY FRIENDS ABOUT THE SELLER.
B0046VGPHQ|5|My first self tanner ever and I am so please as well as being a bronzed goddes!!!
B00ITKPC3S|4|Was Quite big but I'll just wait to use it.
B00I6RWM28|5|I ordered this a couple of months ago it really matched my hair color, it looks natural and you will recieve complements about it. Each strand is thick, however if you want to curl it i would recommend using hairspray or gel to hold it, since the extension is so soft the curl wont stay by itself.
B00N85CRO6|5|I grew up on wood stick cotton swabs so I was thrilled when I saw this at the local Big Lots! I love these. I think they have just the right amount of cotton on the stick. They are much sturdier than the plastic stick ones. They are great for repairing make up, nail polish and of course cleaning ears.
B0013GB1Y4|4|Works great, but didn't last long
B003S516XO|5|there is nothing bad to say about this product, it work perfectly and the price is awesome!
B000P9DS4Q|5|I've been using this for years and absolutely love the product.  I use when I want to wear my hair curly and its great to help define the curls without frizz.  I apply when my hair is pretty wet, get out of the shower, squeeze excess water out and apply.  I've found even towel drying before applying reduces the effectiveness of the product.
B00ANW4LLY|1|Quality sucks! Very disappointed with product because it does not straighten my hair and this hair straightener feels and looks cheap
B00EYSNWXG|4|First the packaging is just Adorable, The Eyelash curler is easy to use and I really like the spring loaded feeling it has so when you are done it just pops right back open with ease. A latch/lock is there to keep your eyelash curler closed when not in use. I have been using it everyday even over my Lancome curler. I can't forget to mention the Amazing Pink pad on there. There are also 5 additional replacement pads included. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions
B003BPL57S|5|Amazing soap, I could rant all day about it but just know your get what you pay for. It leaves you feeling clean without leaving a dry feeling that other soaps like dove do. I live this soap, I will be ordering again and even trying out new scents.
B00MFT36F0|5|This is great because it blocks light (if it doesn't budge too much and it doesn't squish my eyelashes. I think my eyelashes were falling out when I was using the brookstone's blue fuzzy mask. Amazing. For years I've been using the plush velour sleeping mask from brookstone, the only thing that will completely cancel out any light. Sadly I need to sleep in total darkness and any other sleeping mask always had huge gaps where light would flood in.  The problem is is that the brookstone mask was rubbing my eyes and I was losing eye lashes, not to mention it was probably soaking up my expensive eye cream.  These are perfect. There's plenty of room to flutter my lashes (good if you have lash extensions— I don't but now I'm thinking about getting them and they completely cancel out the light. I bought the jade color and now have the black, I don't ever want to be without one.
B00J2APFMW|5|When I received this razor I was excited but also hesitant as I've been using the Gillette Fusion Power and felt the &#34;power&#34; greatly enhanced the shaving efficiency.<br /><br />First thing I noticed is the handle contoured in just the right way to make shaving easy.  The blades were beyond sharp slicing right through my 2 day old stubble.  The real difference came when shaving either side of the neck and just under the jaw line.  The razor flexed and adjusted completely without me noticing but for the smooth skin left after just one pass!  I do have to remind myself not to put anymore than the lightest pressure when using a non-electric razor else I end up with skin irritation. (This is the case for all disposable razors).<br /><br />Overall fantastic, Fusion Power has sat in the drawer now since receiving this and the electric razor stares blankly at me wondering if I'll ever use it again!
B00373O5OE|1|the title says it all. the packaging is ridiculous; 4 people tried to open it, then when we  tried to pry the id off and it exploded. The wood floor may be shinier, albeit stickier though tho...
B00E0M4XZW|5|I bought the T200 to replace a strap on my wife's small Fossil purse. This strap is solid leather--no veneer, stitching, padding or spilt--of excellent quality and sports attractive antique brass hardware. Workmanship is impeccable and much better than the OEM strap. The black dye has a slight brownish tint and matches perfectly with both the leather color and brass hardware of the Fossil purse. My wife was happy with the strap--and she's picky--and so I'm a happy camper.
B000ICRDSW|2|I am not sure what this does to your skin but it makes mine have really dry places and scabs
B002KAIRF8|1|This doesnt stay on my hair- it slides off. It kind of sucks actually and I'm disappointed, esp bc this is a Jessica Simpson product and i love all her stuff. The quality of the hair is good...its just not made well..
B00LP2NV26|5|I loved it! is beautifull
B00LO4EHRI|1|This thing is so cheap and totally sucked!!
B009NPOY14|5|excelente
B000W0A78S|5|Product comes in tub that is &#34;pre chunked&#34; and the larger chunks are easy to split if need be. Melts quickly and did a great job in the body butter I was making. Will order again.
B000NYL3NQ|5|I've tried so many hair serums, but all the ones I have used have made my hair sticky and greasy looking. But this didn't do that at all! It's light, easy to use, smells good, and makes my hair feel so soft!! It's a must have for anyone
B00AIZJF3K|2|It leaks from the base everytime you spray from it. Whenever I need to I to use it, all I need to do is lean it over and it pours out in my  hand as well. What an exctiement and disappointment all in the first spray. What I tried time and time again to contact the dealer at amazon, but to no avail. They ignored my reply for me to reorder another and where to send the other.<br /><br />As a new customer to amazon.com, THIS IS BAD BUINESS!!!
B00I073NF4|5|I only use Olay products and this was one of my favorites. It cleans nicely and has a nice subtle smell to it.
B00ULZ5MAM|5|Like the ease of use....Delivery was quick and aids to learn more are offered...great back up, for me as this is all new...As senior this is another fun toy am trying to look my best...We can't turn the hands of time back but, are able to slow it way down...and you feel better in the process. Do protect your skin with sun screen as you will be getting new tender skin just like a baby's skin...so protect it...Found it not to be painful at all and no need to over due it.. results follow your care! Will report back in time to update on my process. Watched several you-tube videos and many do not follow guide lines, me happy to follow PURUSKIN suggestions. Results take time but, also safer for me and you see your results in a fair amount of time. Recovery of 12 hours and you will see in morning how much fresher your skin looks...it gets better daily....Using it once a week for me as I am in no hurry....enjoy the time for yourself....Thanks for Derma Roller.
B004J46J3U|5|Perfect
B00H8JPMX6|4|After trying numerous dark spot correcting cosmetics I found this product works best.<br />Expensive for the amount of product in this small bottle,however, I have found it has made a very satisfying difference in my total complexion .<br />I recomend this product to anyone seeking to improve their facial appearance from sun damage and age.<br />Oconee Shopper<br />Greensboro, GA.
B000SSDTOI|5|Smoooth ----- goodbye forever to Revlon instruments. Sharp and cut like butter. I'm a new fan!
B007PQYHJW|5|For Christmas my sister got me a travel sized version of this exact shampoo.<br /><br />I had ZERO hopes for it; I had only used Tresemme up until that point (DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TRESEMME DRY SHAMPOO. They literally don't know what they're doing over there.)<br /><br />I tried it just before work one morning and OH MY GOD. It took the grease RIGHT out of my hair. AND IT STAYED THAT WAY FOR 2 DAYS. I sh*t you not! I was so thrilled with it, I bought three full sized bottles: In blush, wild and of course, Cherry. I will say the scent isn't as pleasing as Tresemme, but that's probably why theirs didn't do it for me; they focused more on scent than on function.<br /><br />Batiste has it down. I totally recommend it~!
B003OGP54I|3|not so good quality
B00DTXMYV8|5|Excellent!!
B000WZR92K|5|like this item. it is perfect for a gift and the price is crazy. In another store it would cost more.
B0014P8L9W|4|After one use my face was softer and it cleared some of my blackheads. I would recommend this to everyone. It smells bad with the apple cider vinegar, and makes your face red after the use, but it really works. I noticed a difference, and it makes my face feel clean and clear. I would give five stars, it even came a day early but, its very messy to mix.
B00SXN5EUM|5|I love this product. It does exactly what I hope it would do.
B001B4Q5X0|4|My DH loves it but I find too much comes out as soon as you tip into your hand.
B00OT8YJLU|1|Don't buy! The lines make it hard to readjust eyelashes straight and the eyelashes don't stick to it very well. They're mostly straight so they don't stick to the eye, they come off. I ended up buying the Dolly's one ( they look more like the ones that the lash lift has), and they're curved. Don't waste your money, you'll just have to buy a different set.
B003IGJ87O|5|At the time I purchased this product, I was window shopping for something to stop the shedding & falling out. To my surprise, I was going a severe hormone imbalance. But, this product helped during the time I needed it, I didn't see as much in the sink after styling!
B000C1VWIQ|5|I bought this for my mom who is celebrating her 88 birthday in a couple of weeks. She wore this when I was a young boy and it brought back great memories for both of us.<br /><br />Great service from this seller.
B00AKYYSCM|2|Guess I should have looked at the size closer first. FYI it's the exact size to fit 5 nickels in
B0009DT39C|5|I absolutely love this product! I recently started electrolysis treatments to get rid of unwanted hair on my chin and sideburn area (a problem that started after the babies were born, my hormones went out of whack). My electrolysist told me to stop waxing and plucking completely, because, listen up ladies, it is waxing and plucking facial hair that makes it grow back thicker, not shaving! She told me to trim my hair in between treatments to defuzz. Well, this facial trimmer works like a charm. It takes less than half the time it used to to wax my face and trims it so close, the results are better than when I used to wax. Makeup goes on so smoothly, my skin looks like model skin in a magazine (I'm beginning to think they must trim models' faces too.) This product leaves facial skin surface smooth as a baby. No stubble ever. Best of all, there is no more of that post-wax irritation I used to get (hives, bumps, breakouts). My breakouts along the chin area have ceased completely as well, since I'm no longer plucking. My skin looks clean, hair free all within seconds. The tiny attachment even trims inside the nose. Does not irritate the skin at all. You can glide the trimmer directly across your skin, even the skin inside the nose (be gentle though) and it only removes the hair. And when the hair grows back, it is FINE, so fine, I need a magnifying mirror to see the hairs. I highly recommend this product. Just make sure you stock up on AAA batteries, because it does not come with a starter set of batteries. Other than that, awesome! You won't regret this purchase!
B006HJRXDU|5|Takes 3 coats to cover. Nice dark grape purple. No glitter. Love it.
B001MA0QY2|4|Product works well, however the item looks as if it's been used. Came when expected. Not fast, but didn't take forever either. My sister LOVES it and tries to steal it from me, every opportunity she gets, lol.
B002Z6LHWW|5|Purchased for my husband and he loves it! I would highly recommend this to others! Also had great price for quantity and quality!
B00CZ51CKK|5|Color is exactly what I wanted and foundation blends very well
B00853EZQE|3|I choose this rating cause product its not really as described.  Color I picked was Medium brown and it looks like nlack color. Don't know if I will recommend.
B004LXKY4E|4|A great neutral lip product at a great price point.<br /><br />A nude lip when I am a bit tan wearing bronzer.  Those brown / beige nudes make me look dead.  This seems to be a tad darker than my natural light pink / mauve color, and looks great now.<br /><br />The texture feels as smooth if not better than the HE stuff.  2-tubes should last me summer - fall.<br /><br />I did get fresh product.<br /><br />It does have some type of smell or taste (Vanilla) I prefer no scent<br /><br />Forget all of those HE lippies - no different than this or perhaps not even as good
B003YMJJSK|5|Great for makeup removal and makes my face really clean. My face is very sensitive and this causes zero irritation. Recommended by my dermatologist!
B001KJXKY8|4|This has plenty of colors for me and is compact enough for me to hide up high in my medicine cabinet with it fitting!
B001J8UL3I|5|I love these.  I usually avoid flossing, but with these it became a convenient activity.  It is convenient for two reasons:  the floss is stronger, so it doesn't break when I have to get that... weird thing out... and the angle which I guess is becoming more common now.
B002DMK0IA|5|I have been using this stuff for the past 2 years and I have found that Amazon is the best place to get it.  It is cheaper for me on here than at local stores and availability isn't always the best where I live either.    This is a pretty thick lip gloss and I love that it isn't \\"sticky\\" like some of them.  It has a very smooth, moisturizing finish to it.  There is actually some oomph behind it and it stays on for quite a while.  It is a pretty brown color with a silvery shimmer that compliments an olive complexion quite well.  I also like the slight tingle it delivers.  I will be very sad if they ever discontinue this stuff.
B00FZ1CGME|5|This is a wonderful product! It's easy to use after shaving makes the skin smooth and hydrates it very well. I mix a bit with my face cream every morning and before I sleep. With continued use this product does exactly what it claims.
B002VECKKQ|5|I saw the CoverGirl and Olay Simply Ageless Concealer on Amazon when searching for an alternative to the Lancome waterproof concealer that was almost gone.  It wasn't so much that I was unhappy with the Lancome product, but I really was looking for something that wasn't so extravagantly expensive.  I haven't bought any CoverGirl products in years - probably since I quit using the CoverGirl foundation about 20 years ago - as my skin became less oily and my income increased enough for me to splurge on higher priced makeup.<br /><br />On the other hand, I use Olay products a lot and am very happy with them, both in quality and price -- so when I saw Olay on the packaging it didn't take but a minute for me to decide to give it a whirl.  Well, ok, the fact that I can buy five CG/Olay concealers for the price of one of the Lancome concealers made the choice a no-brainer - what did I have to loose?!?  I tried it and I love it!  The combination of the Olay moisturizer with the concealer is wonderful!  I really have to wonder why any of the other cosmetic manufacturers haven't thought of this yet.  The only thing I would change is making the concealer a bit more . . . well, concealing.<br /><br />In fact, like this product so much that I've ordered the foundation to see if it will be my new go-ti foundation since Lancome has discontinued their product I'd been buying for years (though I don't see me giving up on Lancome mascaras and eyeshadows ever!).  I've ordered the creme blush as well.  Call me cheap - but I'd much rather pay less than $40 for three great products instead of $150+ I've been shelling out for years on the higher end line.  Hey, maybe I can go buy a dreamy summer dress with the money I just saved!
B0009R354M|4|I like barbershops and &#34;classic&#34; sorts of things.  This combines those two elements in one bottle.  Not overpowering, the scent diminishes over a period of about 4 hours. Perfect for an office or business setting.
B000E7UFEU|3|I didn't like the fact that the cologne came about 60% full.. Like, what the fudge!? I pay money so the bottle can come 100% full, heck, I'll even take 95% full.. But 60% full, that's disrespect.. I also find it difficult to apply the cologne.. It has a grenade pin for pete's sake.. But the cologne smells really great..
B007PODMWC|5|This is a excellent product ,it leave my hair soft,shine and smooth, I really love it,  the company should produce more and put available in everywhere!!!
B002UYW3JU|1|It contains lye!! (Potassium hydroxide), why would you want that on your body?? This ingredient is used in batteries!! Disgusting! See the ingredients list yourself... Ew!!!
B00FRL3O14|5|This bag is great.  I used it for my trip to the Dominican Republic. The material is durable and the color is very beautiful.  This bag is great for those who travel all the time.  The bag is very large and you can fit a lot of items.  You can also use it as an overnight bag and the make up case is very handy. You really can also use the make up bag for small jewelery.  I recommend the product.
B00I7PK3GQ|5|excelente
B00AMXKXW0|5|She loves it, we spent about an hour just looking and analyzing the set. Amazing quality for a great price.
B00CC0YRTG|2|not easy to apply and difficult to get the product  out of the container.
B00K1IWFRM|5|nice
B004GWEG76|1|Trying to be healthier but unfortunately you still think when you wear this
B00AWE4PDC|5|China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.
B000RX6TNC|4|I finally broke down and had to get a mouth guard for my grinding. At first it was a little uncomfortable since I normally don't sleep with it but eventually you don't feel a think. My neck pain has reduced dramatically. I  used to wake up with super tight jaw but now I wake up without feeling the pain post grinding.
B000ME2YWG|5|I just purchased this item at Target (paid $49.99) and I love it!  I have short, fine hair, growing out into a chin length bob and although it doesn't work the conventional way (brushing out underneath), I can use it similar to a regular hairbrush and it straightens and sleeks my hair.  I was afraid a straightener would make my hair flat but this gives me volume and the shine is unbelievable.  My usual round of shine serums and smoothing cremes are totally unnecessary now.  This was my first straightening styler and I couldn't be happier with it!
B005NYCDSU|5|This product it 14.99 at my salon for a MUCH smaller tube.  the price is great and my hair loves it!
B004HY48PI|4|had no problems with the items. I received it when stated or before. was the colors that was shown In the add. have gotten a chance to try it out yet. been too busy to put on makeup lately
B00WNT6MQW|5|Love the product. It just the top coat fast drying, making the brush go hard fast. But thanks to the brush safer bottle.
B005JPDPEY|5|I love this oil. I use it in my hair along with other oils and it does wonders for my hair and skin. I highly recommend anyone to purchase this oil, I know I will. The shipping was also very fast as well.
B008T85MU8|5|It was exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to use. No complaints at all. Each dotting tool has one end the same size on every one and one end that varies in size (big to small)
B004FEBHWC|5|it works great! i am going to keep purchasing it.
B0057MHTAA|5|this is really good as a face wash/body wash/and shampoo! at least that all the things i use it for lol.
B005HO0AR2|5|Its just as described..
B004AIC5ME|5|I love this stuff. I had l I ved in Florida my whole life until a few years ago. My dermatologist in Florida said I had Rosacea and had me applying a steroid type cream to keep the redness down. I come out to Colorado and still experience the same issue until Ai find my dermatologist here. He didnt believe that I had Rosacea but just dry skin and started me on Cerave PM and Cerave AM. Not one red cheek since I started with the Cerave PM. My skin looks and feels great.
B002WXO6PS|1|I have followed the instrutions to a T it does not work,I have thier face cream and I like it,but this product does nothing
B003RD4ZE4|4|I don't like creamy based foundation but my mom does, so I bought it for her. I think it makes your face look oily. But then again, it depends on your skin type! Don't use this if your face is oily. It doesn't look very good.
B009XPRZJW|5|Good quality and size for the amount of money you pay. I would definitely buy again.
B00D62M76Y|5|Initially bought it as a present for a friend but ended up keeping it for myself cause I love it that much. Super fast delivery for a great price. Would definitely recommend it to others :)
B00BLDSWCS|5|I had originally purchased this product in New Zealand and was pleased to find I could reorder through a company on Amazon.  I enjoy the long lasting smoothness and fragrance.
B008WA2K9O|5|Everything was perfect!!
B00D8JY58S|3|This eye serum provides moisture and basically does the minimum I ask. I don't see any of the &#34;miracle&#34; aspects it promises, though.
B00CIECMPM|5|Excellent
B000N2KTQK|5|IT WORKS, ITS IS A GREAT MAKEUP-HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS.  CONSISTENT QUALITY, GOOD RESULTS.<br />WOULD RECOMMEND IT WITHOUT RESERVATION.
B00HCQ9HNG|3|It leaked all over  the mailing container
B000ASDX4M|5|This curling iron is the bomb! It is easy to handle and manage and the curls will stay in your hair!
B0009I4IUG|1|Not good.............do not order
B0019W29DO|5|I use this product for under eye bags.  It shrinks them up and takes a good 10 years off!  Getting it on just right takes practice.  I've been using this for years, so I'm a pro.  Even with that, I have to remove it and start over from time to time.  It works best on clean skin rather than applying it over other skin care products.  And I don't put makeup or concealer on over it - that just takes the tight effect away.  It's not a treatment product, it's an immediate fix only, and it lasts for several hours. If you apply too much, it dries white.  But if you have under eye bags, and want to look younger, you can really fool everyone with this product.  It's a miracle worker in my opinion!
B008ABRTE6|1|it seem like it was use it sheds it wasnt wrap neatly and it was nappy! it was so unprofessional iwas disgusted
B00GNA9K8O|5|Tinier than expected, but still works perfectly and has no problem fitting in my small carry case! I mainly bought this set for the powder brush, which has yet to shed on me (which is why it gets five stars). The eyebrow brush is a bit more &#34;loose&#34; than other eyebrow brushes, so if you're wanting more depth and precision this brush would not be for you. The angled eyeliner brush is more &#34;stiff&#34;, but a bit thick for applying a thin line of eyeliner. If you're looking for something more wide and pronounced you might like this brush. Would recommend these brushes if you need to conserve space in your case.
B001KYCUTE|5|I was looking for a shampoo similar to the old formula of Pantene volume(sheer volume) and this one is definitely as good if not better. It makes my hair feel really clean and thick without being frizzy and my hair feels extremely soft after it dries. As a plus, it has very few ingredients compared to others. Highly recommend.
B00AINMFAC|5|this has worked beyond my expectations!<br /><br />I had VERY dry scalp which nothing would help. i tried Olive Oil, leave in conditioners, not washing my hair to washing it every day or every other day and NOTHING helped me.<br /><br />My sister told me about &#34;Nizoral&#34; and i thought to mysle it probably would not work but its worth a try anyway. Once it came in the mail i tried it right away and I was very concerned to why all my dry scalp was now throughout my hair but then thought maybe it was loosing up everything or watever (i was very frustrated), so the next day i used it again and already seen some progress by the 3rd or 4th day i was literally the happiest person alive.<br /><br />after trying everything and being so frustarted that nothing was helping to finally finding something that helped!
B005HT20D4|3|REALLY small. Not sure where everyone else is finding ANYTHING Sephora besides some lipstick for $40 but sure. You get what you pay for with this one
B00IPRF8IE|5|Product is very good, and received in a timely fashion.
B001CL6QGS|3|It's good product...as many people recommend use it for clamming after lime stimulating treatment, but I don't like its smell and I think there is similar product with lower price also will give u better clamming fact...
B00L2W5PHS|4|Somehow i missed the detail about it being only one piece, so I was disappointed when it wasn't a 'pair'. Other than that I'm extremely pleased with them. Their nice, not cheap looking. Very classy
B00HYLVSO0|5|really good comb. it seems durable and feels like it will last a good while unlike those dollar combs.
B000NJHR5O|5|If you dye your hair a lot this is great to have around. Especially if you like to hightlight your hair with things other than bleach kits.
B00O19V5SC|5|This stuff is my absolute favorite facial wash! It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and refreshed! Washes all my make up off perfectly! Not irritating to my skin, which is very dry and sensitive. My skin was so dry and flakey and this stuff works fabulously! I would highly recommend this to anyone. Works great, smells good and moisturizes too. I Love it!
B0009J2C3K|4|Great and fast delivery. Good product, works as expected.A little loud but works well.The small trimmer works well around ears and the neck.
B00K5XJBPW|5|keep my hair just the way I like!
B000L57HI2|5|My husband has very thick hair (he is Caucasian, but his hair is very thick, wavy and coarse) and he LOVES this brush. He has a hard time finding brushes that can do anything to his hair, but this one is great. It says it's 100% pure boar bristle and it's quite stiff (he never uses the soft (black) side, though). He's had his current one for over 5 years and it's just now starting to get a little yucky and needs replacing. I'm so glad I found this on Amazon because his current one I happened to pick up at a little beauty shop that's no longer in business.    FYI, the bristle area on this small one measures 2\\" wide x 3.5\\" long.
B007PY04F0|5|Soft and very nice on the face ،Fairly good help me a lot in the work of make-up<br />I love it very much thank you very much
B008PO6V38|2|Some of the part was broken
B003Q6V6DA|1|I gave this several tries and could not get it to work.  I'm pretty proficient at hair styling and this just would not curl my hair nicely.  if you're looking for a good little curler buy the Conair TS63R MiniPro Ceramic Curling Iron, Blue, 1 Inch and use it like a wand.  perfect curls, every time.
B00027DMI8|1|Was really hoping at the least for a visible improvement even if only I could see. Read the reviews before I purchased and it may have worked for others but for me - I've wasted my money.
B001544IYE|5|This is the best hair dye that is out there and the color is amazing,the results are just amazing. I would really recommend splat colors if your looking to dye your hair.
B0060O762U|1|Very disappointed !!! I ordered this in blue for a special occasion and they sent me burgundy.  So upset they should have just told me they were out.  They just wanted to get the funds
B001KUQJYK|5|Great product, great smell.  I love all the Naked Bee products.  Came right away.
B009CSJB56|5|Works great! Was surprised because the price was so low.
B00UBI8A6C|5|I got this product because I have thin hair that is always looking dull. Once I found out that you can also put the oil on your face and stomach, I got really interested! I have been using it twice a day for three days now and I really like it! My hair feels thicker, has a shine and my face feels like I'm putting good natural product on it. My face is getting smoother and the pores are slowly getting un noticeable.<br />My favorite thing about it is that how easily it absorbs into the skin and hair... its a very non-oily feeling.<br />My least favorite thing is the smell... its very earthy and I am starting to like it actually but as the creater Leia suggests, you can add some scented oil to help.<br /><br />All in all, its a great product and I will be buying it once I run out again!!
B00OKN6Z3E|1|Product came rolled and completely wrapped in bubble wrap and tape. When wrapping was removed the product was completely cracked laterally down the side of the container- and some product wasted due to air exposure (dried out) some wasted due to leakage
B00147X6DQ|5|not as irritating as some other gels I have used in the past - noticed a difference after 1 use.
B000053L6W|5|1st Bay Rum I have ever tried, and I love it.  I find this to be a great scent for a 25 year old male.  The sweet and spicy is something that I have fallen in love with in this product.  I could practically bathe in it.
B00CFCNK6W|3|I wanted to love this product because the dong feels really good..... but the tube kept popping out and cutting me :( I wish I wouldn't have spent so much on this product now :-? if they fixed the tube issue this product would be amazing
B004JXZKWM|1|This is NOT the real product!!!  This is a FAKE!!!  Do NOT BUY!!!  Buyers beware, you can Not return this!!!!  I wish I would've known!!!
B0036G2SMS|5|Love this and smells nice too. Makes my skin look dewy and sets the make up all day. I'll be back for more!
B001MSCODA|5|Great purchase!
B00028QF9U|1|Simply put, this does nothing. You should save your money and grab a rock from your back yard instead.
B005JQBPGI|1|Why did I even give this a try in the first place, the MT brand is so much better. This one just leaves scratch marks all over my skin, the needles are so close together that they do not even penetrate my skin, they just scratch it. Worst dermaroller I have ever used.
B002GP62KY|5|Like very much, taste is very good, use after effect obvious, such as agency said indeed, very to force, recommended!
B008FXFH66|4|As a cosmetologist I needed an inexpensive light to use at home with my OPI gel colors.  This light worked just as expected and got the job done just fine... It is easy to travel with because its so small.. It didnt bother me that I had to cure my thumbs separately.
B0025ZZYE0|5|This spray water is awesome. Just spray a little on your face to set your make or just to feel refreshed. It's invigorating! My little one loves it when I spray his face. I carry a small btl in my purse at all times.
B001OOLLVS|5|WOW...wish i had bought years earlier! I can hardly believe how well -and fast- these worked!
B001GIM7R4|5|I've been using this produce for one year now and I would have to say that I'm very very happy with it.p
B000PLUZL8|5|I have had bad acne since I was in elementary school, a decade and a half later I finally cleared most of it up with proactive. That would have been fine if it weren't for my obsession with picking every pimple that I have ever had.  To date I have probably wasted around $15,000 on peels, laser treatments, creams, and derm abrasions, only to have the acne flare back up and have scars return.     I bought this product a few weeks ago and was extremely hopeful yet very apprehensive. If $15,000 can't help the scars what will an $18 bottle of acid do?  Magic, that's what it will do! I have done 2 peels so far and have seen a large reduction in the red scars, and the deep pock marks have a less cavernous appearance. I continued to use proactive and only had a small amount of actual peeling. On the other hand, my skin is very tough.      So far I love it! It is gratifying to watch the scars fade with each peel, even more exciting knowing that that same peel would cost me upwards of $150 if I were to go to a dermatologist.
B002WTC38O|5|It seems to work.  Lashes are considerably longer fairly quickly.  Unlike Latisse, my eyes are not left discolored and itchy.<br />Delivered quickly.
B006WZ9X8M|5|This is the perfect shade of red lipstick. The color looks exactly like the picture. Very pleased
B000E80EDQ|5|This cake eyeliner is great. Goes on easily, and lasts all day. Never smudges and the color is not too dark. Best cake eyeliner I have ever used.
B001P1ZELS|5|Fine product
B004AQ4VIC|5|Love this cologne!
B00C1GVWAS|5|I don't like going without this product! it does wonders for my natural hair.
B00D2J39PE|5|Fits my bras perfectly.
B000851N9E|5|This sunscreen is great. It goes on a little bit like a moisturizer or lotion, but that's better than being matte, especially on my tan skin. Also, I see no whiteness. That's a first for zinc oxide sunscreens on my body. Very pleased with this product. Compared to some other zinc oxide sunscreens I tested this year, this is my favorite.
B0002Q67EA|5|The first time that I shaved with this razor I could immediately notice a difference. It is definitely worth the price and I would highly recommend it. This is the best razor out there.
B000GCNDDI|5|this oil smells really good and can be used on hair and skin the price is very reasonable i will buy again
B00EYZY6UW|5|I've never tried a product like this before, but I definitely have hair that is perfect for it. It's thick, long, and just a little wavy.<br /><br />This... is great. I've tried many hair products that had virtually no effect on my hair. Promises of lovely waves, no frizz, you name it. I tried this one time, and I could immediately notice the difference - and the difference stayed!<br /><br />I will admit, the jar is a little smaller than I expected, and with long hair it might be a little pricy since I have to use a tiny bit more than normal users, but if it continues to work like this it's totally worth it, especially in Michigan winters.
B00ICN91LG|5|We give this product to my sister, and now I see that you can have better tabs without inflammation of the skin or eyes and she told me she saw he had a good eyelash growth, contributing to a better makeup and better Indeed, highly recommended
B004KC1FL2|3|I like the case itself and I think the idea of the LED light and mirror on the side was cool.  The color is very pretty.  HOWEVER...once I applied the gloss, my lips started stinging as though I applied Vick's to them.  And there was a menthol smell to it also...a little disappointed.
B00KBGHC9K|5|This really is a very good oil.  My skin feels very smooth after applying the oil and is possibly lightening some spots on my face, although it's too soon to tell for sure.  I would love it if that were to happen! And as others have said, it does make my eyelashes appear to be longer, although I think it's the way the oil lays on the lashes rather than causing them to be longer.  That's a very nice effect that other oils do not do.  I tested that to compare the difference and there definitely is a difference.  This is an excellent oil.
B004PXIR1W|5|Amazing little shaver, great battery life once broken in, easy to clean and cuts very short. I also love the fact that it is so easy to adjust the cutting height. Definitely recommended!
B000V3RZ04|5|This is an excellent product. I have long hair with all over color and highlights. I shampoo with Goldwell Kerasilk shampoo and conditioner (which I wholeheartedly recommend)  and after rinsing those products out, I put the  Davines on and wrap hair in a towel for 30 minutes. Then rinse, dry and style. This is NOT a leave in as one reviewer said it is. My hair is really silky using this product with the others I mentioned above. I love it. Not cheap...but you don't need too much.
B00DQGZFB4|3|Not enough power, you know what I mean? Cheap really
B003UKKH6O|5|A toothbrush such as this was highly recommended by my dental hygenist. It does a great job on my teeth, but the small head does not hold enough toothpaste to also cover the roof of my mouth and my tongue.  I do a \\"quick\\" all-over brush with a regular toothbrush, followed by a \\"detail\\" brush with this instrument.
B001DEVPI8|5|Remember that amazing purplish blue that just made green and blue eyes pop? This is it. I have been looking for a replacement for my original for 4 years, no one has it. Stila has excellent eye shadows anyway but the convertible eye colors are fantastic, I wish they would bring Lapis back into the stores. It is a very wearable and flattering color.
B003U8SHXG|5|I love this stuff. I was buying the pre-bottled and heavily marketed Goji berry juice until I discovered the Dynamic Health brand. I buy this, sea buckthorn, acai berry and mangosteen. I take a shot of each once a day, or sometimes I'll mix them with my juice in the morning for an added kick of energy that lasts literally all day. I don't get tired until late evenings. It's the only &#34;energy drink&#34; I'd recommend. You know it's good for you when you can feel the difference!
B002FC7B2G|5|High quality razor. This is good for very sensitive skin. When I used a standard plastic razor with cartridges, it left my skin very irritated. This was very helpful to eradicate this.
B0011XWPNK|5|I only paid $100.00 for it when I bought it now it is $200 I will not pay that much its ok sure it helps wrinkles only when you wear it wash it off and the wrinkles are back
B000EGILR4|4|This is awesome stuff.  I could tell a difference right away.  I wish it was more affordable though!
B003EUSRNA|4|Good quality shower gel.  Has a woodsy pine scent that permeates the bathroom when used - great for guys.  The scent does not linger and your skin will smell natural afterwards.  You won't smell like a forest.  My skin does well with this product, but you will run through it fast because its consistency is a little runny by nature.  Obviously, does not suds up due to the lack of certain ingredients that cause skin irritation / cancer.  Would buy again.
B003JKFEL8|4|Its smaller than I thought. Perfect for travel. It smells great, as I was told from someone from Youtube. I hope to order more in the future.
B001EJOPTS|5|the best!!!! deep clean my skin
B000EGIEOE|5|Remember that time you nicked yourself shaving cause you were in a hurry, then had to go out in public while battling a bleeding face wound? Yeah.... that doesn't happen if you use these. It is like a magic cut eraser!
B00H6LUYW0|5|Excellent!
B00BPNR51I|2|Actually love the product, very smooth vibrant color. What I don't love is that, you only get the tip you see. There is no more, you can't shave the pencil, or twist for more liner. I got about 10 applications before it was gone :(
B001CB2OQO|5|I am SO happy that I bought this one and added it to my collection. What an awesome help it can be when you need a little help making things go more smoothly with people! It doesn't work miracles, but  where some situations and people are concerned, it can come pretty close. It seems to exude an effect where people just seem more mellow, friendly, more sociable, chatty. Yes, it is a pheromone, but this is a SOCIAL pheromone mostly. My experience has shown that it can make things go much more smoothly on the home front as well. And when it comes to self effects, this one has helped me immensely even when it comes to being on the phone with difficult people. I suppose it effects me and then they in turn, simply mirror what I am putting out. However it does it, it is a BIG winner in many scenarios. A truly beautiful blend.
B006FJLLHG|4|I love this product. My twists outs look so good and I get so many compliments since I've been using this product. Just make sure you use it with other Camille Rose products it does not mix well with anything else. I also mixed this along with Camille Rose Curl Maker for a more defined twist out and I wanted my hair to hold up for a night out it did not disappoint. I only wish it was cheaper on Amazon, but Target always sells. Please reduce the price Amazon the. I would give it 5 stars
B00C0Y0MEI|5|I have searched long and hard for a headband that would be both comfortable, as well as one that can contain my head full of hair.  I have really thick hair and most headbands will not work on my hair.  These work great and I have received a lot of compliments on them as well.
B006E9JKCU|5|Nice color, lasted
B001BAN0FK|5|Item arrived fast and in great shape, no chips scratches or dents in foam.  Looks just as it does in pic. We have painted her to look like an alien as a Halloween decoration she looks great!
B000143C0K|5|The clippers perform better than I could have image.
B004FNKHO2|3|It's Ok
B008OINZAM|5|I absolutely love this product.  It's very handy, I bring it wherever I go. It's so cute, it looks like a little book, you wouldn't even know it's a make up.<br /><br />The quality of the product is really good. It lasts the whole day. I highly recommend this and will order again when I run out.
B0013F8JXG|5|smells good
B0058NANJC|5|My Husband and I love, love, love African Black Soap. A little goes a long way. See how to liquify to make a shampoo or bath wash.    [...]
B00P6RAVEW|4|Is to use and clean.
B00GYF65TK|4|After using this for months, I wasn't completely whether if it was making a difference. But now, I have no doubt it works! Because...recently, I went about 2 weeks without using it. (I ran out of it, and wasn't able to get around to reordering it for about 2 weeks.) In that two weeks that I stopped using it, I noticed a gradual but significant increase in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes, as well as increased dryness. Now that I'm using the gel again, I have seen a significant decrease in the appearance of the wrinkles around my eyes. It does not completely remove the wrinkles, of course (this ain't a miracle drug), but for me at least, it truly reduces the visibility of the wrinkles around my eyes--as long as I keep using it.
B005Q5N45W|5|The first time I tried this product I couldn't believe how soft my feet felt. I play hard on my feet since I live an active lifestyle and attempting to remove well-deserved calluses is a daunting task -- a job never finished. Grace foot was so easy to use, you only have to slide your feet into the foot packs for about 2 hours then your free to go about your business. They stay in place and are completely comfortable to walk around in. My back is thanking me because I don't have to bend over and use foot tools anymore. I'm happy I found this product and I will be purchasing them again.
B00BB8ZIW0|5|Love it!  Does not frizz out my hair at all in fact it smooths it really well and gives me that just went to the salon look.
B003IXJ30O|1|I orded two of these and expected them to be a normal size for hand soap. They came together in an evelope which puzzeled me until I opened it. I was horribly disappointed when I saw they were each about two applications. When I visit my daughters, we are able to go to the Bath & Body works store where I purchase several containers of their wonderful scented soaps. It had not occured to me that their online items would be a complete rip-off. I will never order their products online again and may not even purchase them at the mall.
B00SNDITEK|5|great scent, perfect for travel.
B00O71O8XS|5|Recieved exactly what was pictured and am very happy with my purchase. The tattoos are easy to apply and look great! I'll know more about how long they last after I go to Bonnaroo (the reason I bought them!) Hoping they hold up to the sun & craziness of festival season! I plan to share them with those I'm camping with, since they are super cute!
B009PBAEF6|4|Now, this may arguably not be a good thing, but my 7 year old daughter loves it.  Also, the batteries ARE replaceable, you just need to use a bit of brute force.  However, the toothbrush may need replacement anyway just because of wear and tear at that point.
B00C2M0GBW|1|Cheap looking and snapped before i even wore it.
B00NN07IMW|5|I was skeptical when I bought these for the low price, but these are great!  I wouldn&#34;&#34;t hesitate to purchase again.
B003UP1JZW|5|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS ONE.
B0040OUQPQ|5|I actually like the color a lot.  Plus this brand is a great lip moisturize with a tint.
B0002D5Y92|1|When the motor spins up to full speed this cuts nose hair well, but all too often the motor slows down and then it tugs. This is the third Panasonic nose hair trimmer I've had (two different models) that have the same problem, even though I keep them clean the motor sometimes won't spin up to full speed. It's difficult to point the light in the right direction. This problem existed from day 1 -- fortunately, even after a couple of years, it doesn't get much worse -- other designs I've tried (Norelco) have a different shape head cutter that doesn't actually trim my nose hairs.
B00U6R3SI8|1|I really do not like this polish.  The color is an ugly barfy washed out peach color, and it leaves my nails feeling gritty.  Expensive for such a bland, boring top coat.  Not glittery at all.  I bought a really cute similar product from another company for 99 cents that beats this off the map!
B000GLRREU|5|My wife and I both use this unit. It is small enough that it is out-of-the-way yet does everything needed.
B004X1ZUZM|5|I have light skin and this light concealer works like magic. It covers all of my acne scars and feels great on my skin. I also love the thick texture.
B00G7S424O|5|Seems to work quite well and the lavender fragrance is soooo much better than generic polish removers. I'm happy that I bought it, even though it's more expensive than the usual national brands.
B0018OVL3W|1|Just as a previous reviewer, I received a drawstring bath bag in place of the ordered hot water bottle.  I assume the green terry cloth is similar in both products, but having the same thing happen again -- that's just bad customer service.
B00CLILRMY|2|Did absolutely nothing for my skin. If not followed by a lotion right after the serum creates a film that sits on top of the skin.
B00604MSPA|4|Pros:<br />- Lathers & cleans effectively<br />- Smell is pleasant but not overpowering<br />- Price is reasonable<br /><br />Cons<br />- You have to squeeze pretty hard to get it out
B0058NANJC|5|There are several things to like...It's organic,; It cleared up my skin, as I use it on my body and face ( I am 50+ years old). You do need to keep it in a container, or it will melt.
B001GQ3GEY|5|Excellent product. I have been using it for the last three weeks now and its working very well. I recommended it to my farther in-law and I bought one for him and he really likes it.
B001GNBVPS|5|It works for  me, good product
B008X3658W|5|Just plain epsom salt. I can use this for plants, cleaning, bathing, etc and there are no extra scents or ingredients.
B005GOP5Y6|5|This stuff is pretty awesome. It gives smooth, glowing skin instantaneously, which is great for a person that doesn't tan and cannot apply a self tanner properly, ever. I am pasty white and when I applied glow it gave me a bit of tan...very pretty and even tan. Additionally, it is paraben free, which is pretty great. Definitely will be buying more of this product.
B00I55A4TY|5|I plan on continuing to buy this henna from you. I brought one at a beauty supply store,  oh my goodness was it bad. It had a lot of sand texture to it and I had to continue to wash my hair, and I didn't see no change in color or texture. with this Henna everything was smooth and it did it purpose. Its natural alright.
B009L13OZ2|5|I looked for several hours for a lip palette to replace all the lipsticks in my purse (as a space saver). I wanted a quality palette that included a neutral, a brown, a pink, a red, and a purple. I though this would be an easy request, as there are so many palettes out there, but it was not. There are a lot of products but to find one that would fit into my makeup bag for toting and to cover all the lipstick color basics was some feat. The color choices are all in soft shimmer. The colors are a little more sheer than I initially expected and would classify them as light to medium coverage. But since this palette is for my mid-day at work touch up this works perfect for me. The lightest color (Camero Brown) is more of a highlighter than a stand alone color. All colors are great for blending with eachother for more color choices. The cosistancy of all colors is creamy smooth without feeling greasy.<br /><br />The color names are in order as shown:<br />Rose Cloud.....Camero Brown<br />Clayton Clay...Rapture Rose<br />Russet............Tomato Purée
B000CC38SM|2|Stained/got dirty very easily. I tried washing it but the inside liner ripped open in several places so that when you use it the foam sticks out. I love the outside fabric, just wish the inside was more durable.
B000S0CKRS|5|I am a mature woman with dark brown hair.  I ordered this product to tint some graying eyebrow hairs.  The product was easy to use and went on without a problem. I used a wet paper towel to wipe the brows after a minute or two of processing time.  My skin was not stained and the brows looked great.  I am very happy with this.
B00CK0WA5G|5|Very good lotion. Nice quiet smell. Not greasy. Blends well. Lasts long.
B001KYRLIO|5|Y first foray into liquid foundation. Good match to my skin tone. Use a little or layer a lot, depending on how much coverage you want. I like that it has SPF. My skin is combination (oily T zone, apples of cheeks, dry everywhere else) and it made my skin look slick after 6 hours, nothing a face blotting paper can't fix
B00NJYFTLE|5|I have premature crows feet from too much sun and smiling, as well as pretty dark under eye circles. This serum takes care of both problems.
B00AI1S3N2|4|Love it
B000C1Z1B0|2|I used  this in the early 70's... it was my fave... I guess my body chemistry has changed... it doesn't smell the same to me .... I don't care for it now..
B00XIL08WI|5|Love the look and that they are easy to apply and long lasting.
B001KZCFMA|5|This product just loosened my natural curls and caused there to be a beautiful wave pattern.  My hair is already naturally curly, but I just wanted the curls to be loosened but not straigtened.  I used the regular formula and was very pleased with the result. Of course, right after I put the product on and combed through my hair, I immediately washed the product out, so that my hair was not too straight.  I did not want a perm but something to add a little softness to my naturally curly look.
B000FZ4TFC|2|I have cracked heals and a bit of a callous problem.  They aren't dragon feet, but they do have to be softened pretty often.  I have used the little blade scraper tool for a few years and that works well but when I saw the Artemis Heel Smoother advertised, I decided I had to try it.  It's a waste of money.  The appliance is no more than a low-tech dreml.  In fact, I have a Dreml type tool that was marketed as a dog nail trimmer that works better.  The Artemis appliance does NOT scrape any dried skin away..it merely sands your foot a bit..that is when you can get the darn thing to stay on the spot you put it on.  It comes with a small container of foot conditioning balm that is probably just straight cocoa butter except it has a really offensive aroma.  I would just as soon use a piece of sand paper than this thing.  Save your money.
B00NUW6GHG|1|They came half ruin and melted! The ones that weren't ruin before I opened my packages turned nasty and gooey in a very short time!
B000C20ZKQ|5|I love this scent!  It is one of my favorites.  My only negative is it doesn't last long as the scent is weakened.
B002UEFCY8|5|This stuff is the best!!! Buy it!! I have tried everything and this is the only stuff that works!! I love it
B00DILCB1Y|5|Very good  product
B00CPR94OE|5|Great product, I highly recommend!!!!!!
B005IAWFZK|3|This top coat has larger hexagons and lots of small glitter.  When I apply it I only get one or two hexagons.  it looks more like a sparse glitter top coat.
B00NES8D7W|1|I've been using the oil for month now and don't see any results of my dark circles lighten up
B00KBPRO0I|4|I got 3 colors:black, red, and yellow. They do there job and serve as great hair clips. I only use them to style my hair not as a hair pin
B0086LC49K|3|So a few weeks ago I have received my order. I love and enjoy the different colors, styles and designs provided.<br />The bottles are cute, but the only problem is how small they turned out to be. The pictures showed them to look like a pretty decent size/amount. But when I opened my tiny little envelope and saw really tiny baby bottles- I was very unsatisfied. (I contacted the seller and I got my money refunded so these ended up being free for me).They do get really messy, I wish their was stick or something to help out with application. Overall I'm half satisfied due to the fact that it was free and that the colors are very cute, I didn't get the black glitter so that was a bit upsetting. The size is as tine as a penny if not smaller! Over all I'm more happy than sad with my purchase. I do suggest you to purchase these little glitter bottles but just be aware that its very small and you might get upset at first but just embrace the cute colors provided.
B006USAR6I|1|I never used this because when it came one of the ingredients was propyline  glycol. Which is the specific ingredient that my cosmetologist told me to avoid.
B001TKE47A|5|Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.
B0018Q1PZE|5|Not only was this product great, but lotions galore is a great site to work with.  just remember with any tanning product with dha self tanners, take your time putting them on, once the heat of the tanning bed hits it, it will bake as you put it on.  circular motions is great for putting on.  i love all the ambrosia line, your skin feels great and smells awesome.
B001AOL8MY|4|I started plucking a few hairs from my chin when I was about 45, I guess. Since then, they've gotten more enthusiastic. I don't spend much energy on decoration and stuff -- I don't pluck anything else. I don't even shave my legs or wear makeup. But little hairs springing out of my chin is not something I was ready for. It was like the one thing I with which I couldn't deal, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Effectiveness<br />Works for me. Much longer between hairs. And instead of finding six 2mm hairs that weren't there yesterday, I less often find one or two, and they're not long enough to get hold of for a couple of days.<br /><br />Skin<br />I tend to be sensitive to stuff you put on skin. I go for &#34;sensitive skin&#34; versions and stuff. I mean, I'm about a 5-6 on the 1-10 scale for sensitive skin. And this stuff didn't irritate. I used it daily, and didn't notice any bumps or redness at all.<br /><br />Smell<br />I'm picky; I strongly prefer stuff with natural scent. In fact, I often can't use commercial cleaning products because the smell makes it hard to breathe and stuff. This stuff has not a wonderful, natural scent, but a not-unpleasant and not-apparently-toxic scent. Didn't make me gag or cough. Your mileage may vary, of course, but that's my experience.
B0051UHJGM|1|Love the color, fragrance, texture and foam of this shampoo.  Unfortunately, it's very painful when the tiniest bit of shampoo gets in your eyes!  Never had a shampoo that caused so much discomfort.  Would not buy it again.
B001JQLNMS|5|Very good it is really nice.my wife very like it .The face feel many water and write.hope it can writer after weeks
B004USS6Q8|4|These eye liners are a great buy. Iv never had a liquid eye liner that was so easy to use and that lasted so long! I give these guys a thumbs up =)
B000OYJ9AO|5|Love this stuff! Smooth, smells great, no after oily feeling.
B00GUNYDAE|2|Did not work for me and the size runs small.
B00O9SECTO|5|My wife loved it, perfect size n good quality product.
B001VNCA0S|5|item arived before scheduled time,whitch was awesome and i love it.i think it's cheaper in some stores but i just couldn't find it anywhere besides on line.
B003BMGAFI|2|Cheap
B002LM83IQ|1|This soap smells really weird (kind of a chemical smell).  I was willing to ignore the smell, but it also dried out our skin, so I can't say I like this soap at all.
B003EN4T2U|4|nice product, fast shipping and good deal
B00014D138|5|Good moisturizer for dry skin! I use it on my face, but it can be used elsewhere
B00U5KBW7U|5|Good product, on time delivery.
B00F4YQWXG|4|I haven't received any compliment while using this.  Perhaps it is a good thing.
B0041PSDAO|3|It is a nice finishing paste, holds my straight hair well while retaining flexibility.. However contrary to other reviewers, I find it to have lasting stickiness and really hate the scent. It, to me, has the lingering odor of rubbing alcohol which I thought might evaporate when it dried, but it does not. Sig other agrees with me on this point. The scent is the only reason I wouldn't purchase again.
B00C4O1G9O|1|No recommendation here, the instructions are lacking, and I will never do a water was application again.  Took 2.5 hour to do.  The gentle file to shape before clear polish applied, only took the applique off.  Lasted a day and a half, wasted my money on this purchase.  Going back to adhesive back, love those, easy to apply and last.
B00523M3IC|5|I purchased The Nugglebuddy as one of my Moms Christmas presents.She & I have severe arthritis in our backs,hip & elsewhere.She loved the pansy cover{those being her favorite flower}& the Lavender aroma smells delightful.The weight is not too heavy nor to light & the heat emanating from it is superb! She uses it everyday & is VERY PLEASED with this product.I will be ordering another one for myself soon.A GREAT PRODUCT that does the job naturally!thanks Nugglebuddy!
B002T5H4BC|5|Best by far outdoor tanning oil. I've used it for 8 years and get the most beautiful sun kissed skin ever! It is oil, so you have to be careful if your at the beach or where you can get dirty. I use it poolside and reapply after I swim.
B005V2UHIW|5|ty
B001453QPQ|4|It's not a miracle cream for sure. It does seem to sort of help. It definitely made my legs feel smoother. I paid almost 30 dollars for it and I am out two weeks after. Two weeks is not even enough to see the results.  I wish they offered you a better deal than that.  I do like the stuff though. I just think it's a little pricy.
B002OCANQI|5|I switched over to DE (double edge safety razor) shaving because I really hated shaving in the morning. Nothing like a cruddy disposable razor feeling like it's yanking your whiskers out by the roots at 0530 to start the day right. The blades that came with the razor I bought were an improvement, but not the radical change I had envisioned. After doing a little reading I tried some Feathers. This was what I was hoping for when I made the switch to DE wet shaving!<br /><br />I can't tell you much more about the differences between these and other blades, because after I used my first feather I had what I was looking for and haven't tried anything else since.
B000SKWVGS|5|As in my title I am african american.  It's very hard to find products that don't cause a build up and give my hair moisture, body and shine.  Also I have very fine/thin hair and I relax my hair.  Anyone who fits this category will love this product.  My hair has a lot of body,soft and manageable and doesn't look so thin.  I love this product by Matrix Amplify and you will too!
B000V2ACH8|5|It works with great with short/medium length asian hair. It helps maintain your style and control stubborn asian hair. Great buy.
B001GQ2EGU|4|I purchased this product along with the pink jar (loose). I prefer the pink one because it gives a more natural look. this one makes bigger waves, but hair will \\"stick\\" together and it's a bit hard to comb it thru. but I still use this product when I want a more dramatic look.
B00466RIH2|5|I've used this product foe 6 years. It is a great product when applied twice daily. My skin is always looks it's best.
B007JLLBM4|2|The product arrived a day late and when I tried the product it went on smoothly but I didn't see any difference in my skin.  I have been using it twice a week like they suggest and my skin looks the same and I haven't noticed any other changes.  The only thing that was true was that it smells nice like chocolate.  Very Dissapointed.
B000FEF1V4|4|This Product works great,much better than other bands i own. The battery holds charge for multible uses& this product has the option of using the cord supplied. The turbo vacuum is a great feature,tho it still allows some hair to fall. This apears to be a well made product& i would recomend to anyone looking for a trimmer in this price range
B00HH2POZ0|5|We all use this, love it works well
B007AS62J8|2|I read all reviews before I purchased these at a local store for around the same price. I was super hopeful these would work! Ever since having a child my face has had so many break outs and these wipes actually made it worse! I was really disappointed I didn't get the same results as other reviewers. I could go without the added perfume scent. One positive is the wipes are a good size and you can easily wipe all of your face with it.
B00IY004FY|5|Super cute and comfortable!
B001F51QHK|2|bad taste in mouth
B005DINDGW|4|I like this product.
B0033ZC340|5|Smart shade goes on easily, blending with my natural color and without skin irritation.
B004CDQ73K|5|We go to the pool several times a week, this is nice and thick, although a pain to wash off your hands. My daughter has never had a sunburn or any skin problems with this.<br /><br />It has a little bit of a scent, but I like it.<br /><br />We will keep purchasing this!
B000NHTWEU|5|I decided to purchase this oil because of the excellent reveiws given by other customers.Well now i can see they were abolutely right, i fell in love with this strong clean pure Muguet scent, natural and long lasting. Highly recommend, very good quality oil.<br /><br />,
B004NLU638|5|Mirror Mirror on the wall.... I dont care what you say, My skin feels awesome and<br />when I add the unscented Ultimate Aloe creme after the scrub... Simply wonderful.
B000ALIKPQ|5|Love it
B003BQ6QXK|5|Received the shower mirror right on time and just in time.  Easy to install and very functional.  Highly recommend this company and this product.
B000C1ZDSG|3|it's not that the expected
B0045X5Y8G|5|Great to have in your bag and takes up almost no room.  I use it for my toddlers hands and face when we are on the go.  No strong scent and gentle enough for my eczema prone son's skin.
B002ZTT9II|2|This primer is as dense as petroleum jelly. it's hard to get as little as you need, and hard to distribute evenly on the skin. It does not set up and dry. It remains tacky and attracts makeup like a magnet, so you use and waste too much foundation. It clings to brushes. The pink tint is not noticeable. The last of the primer remains in the tube, another waste. It would be easier to use and less wasteful if sold in a jar. The best primer is from BE, and the Maybelline product is not even in the running.[[ASIN:B0017U10SI bareMinerals Original Prime Time Foundation Primer]]
B0046VGPHQ|5|I love this product! I am NOT orange! I have received so many compliments on my Fake Bake tan. I work in the medical field and must always look professional and presentable to all, everyday I received at least 2 comments about the tan. When I tell them I did it myself, they are so impressed and ask what product is used. I have recommended this product countless times. The color is so natural looking, I'm a bronzed beauty with this product. It's so easy to apply with the mitten, however you must take your time and really make sure you apply it correctly and stay away from water, sweat, or the rain. Or else you will be a splotchy mess. I love this product and plan to continue buying their products. I also purchased the Fake Bake Aerosol Can, I use that on my face it is easier to apply.
B008LY6EUW|5|works great
B006YFCHSS|5|The best!!
B003XIXH38|5|Just what I needed
B000OP3R7O|5|Very nice all natural cologne that I have purchased many times at Whole Foods market. However, it is about $10 less here, so very happy with the service and price
B001KYVKR2|5|Great product and price!
B00I3VHKVK|4|Very nice brushes I wasn't sure what to think because of the reviews but I have had no problem with the hairs falling off. I can see what people are saying about the paint smell, but it didn't really bother me. This is my first set of makeup brushes and as a girl first introducing herself to makeup, these work really nicely. I'm just proud to say I have my own(; Came in a timely manner, appear as they do in pictures,  would buy again.
B00LUFVC9C|3|I have been using this product for the last week.  Unfortunately, I am not able to use it for what I intentionally purchased it for (as a facial moisturizer).  I developed blackheads on my forehead and cheeks and cysts along my jaw line after using this product even though shea butter is supposed to be non-comedogenic.  I gave this product 3 stars, however, because this product works fine as a moisturizer for my legs and arms and the company's communication was first rate.
B000UQDKNI|5|I got this for my hair (nappyside) and ohhh boy do I love it! I was disappointed in the fact that you actually get one brush and not three as shown in the picture. However, after trying it out in my hair that didn't matter at all.
B008DVZRSI|5|This cream was exactly what I need and looking for. It's a prefect massaging cream. Excellent purchase, would recommend to anyone!!
B000Z5YG8C|5|Delightful!  Makes skin feel so soft & full of moisture.
B00021DWAW|5|This is my ultimate favorite. I have never had so many compliments and people asking what it is and where I got it. I simply love it.
B0031NRC86|5|The retinoid pads are great for my sensitive skin.
B005H3OKE2|4|This is the first hyaluronic acid serum that I've used. I originally received it in a sample size, and loved it so much (under my regular moisturizer and sometimes on it's own) that I immediately replaced it with a full size version.<br /><br />Because it is aloe-based, it's necessary to let it dry properly before layering anything over the top of it (moisturizer, makeup, etc.). If you don't, it will rub off in coagulated bits, as this is the nature of aloe.<br /><br />That being said, I can afford the extra couple of minutes in my routine. I really like this product, though I may experiment with other hyaluronic serums to see if I'm missing anything. I have acne-prone skin and use it over benzoyl peroxide gel (and sometimes under cetaphil). It balances out my skin without the greasiness that can accompany over-moisturizing.
B00AFCOZN6|5|I am African-American and I have thick, dry hair that needs lots of moisture.  This hair oil creme provides a lot of moisture without being too oily.  It does not weigh the hair down and leave any oily residue.  I would purchase this product again without hesitation.  I LOVE IT!!!
B000M5II5C|5|This cream is a grower not a shower. The smell is nice, but not strong. To me it smells like those papaya chewable enzyme pills (if you know what I'm talking about, you know just what I mean). A pleasant smell. What I really like about it is that it isn't greasy, and yet it does provide that emollience that a lot of hand creams don't. It's a good mix between shea butter (what I used before but too greasy) and creams, which don't seem to provide enough for my hands. I am eczema prone and even have a tiny bit on my hand right now, and this does not aggravate it at all.<br /><br />Dessert Essence makes some excellent products I have decided. Their raspberry shampoo and conditioner smell amazing and make my hair shine. (Be careful buying that on amazon though, as the last one I bought was not the original. Very easy to tell.  Buy it at the natural food store first to test).<br /><br />All in all, high quality stuff.
B004QXYJ40|5|Works well.
B006KE29KE|5|Recommended by my hair stylist.  My hair feels clean, but not dry.  Love the smell.
B00BV5EX8S|2|This hair dryer lasted precisely 10 months before it blew out. Terrible purchase, now I have to go and buy another one since it is only guaranteed for return for one month after purchase.. Not very impressed.  OK update from Vidal Sassoon - just called them and they guarantee for three years so they will send me a replacement. At least they have good customer service. at VS.
B000VK8DTE|5|Nice product.  Solved my hair problems and smelled good.
B007VB50LU|5|This is a great alternative to shaving with a real blade.  The cut is of course not as close, but good enough.  I like that there are both coarse and fine cutting blades.  This is my second shaver of this this style and I will happily purchase another when the battery on this one eventually fails as all rechargeable batteries do.  While I'm very flexible, the extension handle comes in very handy when trimming my back between my shoulder blades.  I also like the quick charge time and the relatively long use time.
B0010HP494|5|A friend of mine (who also has braces) gave me one of these to use. She bought them from her orthodontist office for a dollar apiece. I found these here for a lot less and since I'll have my braces for a while longer, I ordered them. If I had any complaint, it would be that each package only comes with one cover for all eight brushes so you have to remember not to throw it away with the brush. Otherwise, they work great to get between your teeth and braces.
B004WIUNCG|5|My mom got this braun cruzer 6 beard and head for christmas 2 years ago. I works as good as it did the day I got it. The battery pretty lasts at least an 1 hour  before it runs out. Good for shaving and trimming beards. Nice for hair cutting as well. I use the little minnie shaver on top to shape myself up. you can even wash this thing out in the sink because all the electric parts inside are sealed off. I strongly recommend this braun cruzer 6.
B004NCFOZM|1|I was not happy. It made my skin break out. I guess not all things work for all people.
B003ZUZDRC|4|Love, love, love the product. I have been doing my own nails for a few weeks now and I cannot believe that I used to pay someone 40+ dollars for this. This color in particular is very very sheer. It would be a great base color for a french manicure or to use under a glittery shade. I like nude and neutral shades, but this is a little sheer even for me.
B00DMFN156|1|This hose is stiff and retains the bends of the original shape.<br />I find I'm being woke up from sleep fighting the hose.<br />I will not buy this hose again.
B009HULKLW|1|This product was a waste of time and money. It took forever to use the curlers and to get your hair set and the result was absolutely flat and lifeless.
B0068RXP0G|5|Great sharp blades, cut well.
B002LFLQBE|5|Thankyou for still having my favorite color
B00R2L69EG|4|I had the opportunity to try this project for free as a BzzAgent. I've been using it for about a week, and so far, I'm really liking the product! It doesn't take much longer than my previous brushing regime, and it's nice to have a reminder to brush for a longer amount of time. (I probably used to cut corners and not brush for the full 1-2 minutes a dentist recommends.) My mouth does feel fresh and clean after using the toothpaste and it has a pleasant taste. I'm not sure if I've noticed whiter teeth yet, but I did have a bit of tooth sensitivity one day, which I usually get when I try a whitening product - so that makes me think it's working! Overall, I like this product and will continue using it, hoping to see continued results. The price listed here seems a little steep, although I guess you should figure that you're basically buying two tubes' worth of toothpaste, even though this product won't last any longer than a typical tube would last.
B001ABLKK2|5|Awesommmmmmeeeeeee, buy it do not hesitate. I'm one of those who buys something and want it to work right There. And this product trully exceeded my expectation.
B008RU1F2W|4|My husband has been searching for this very model for ages.  It is the only trimmer that works for him.  He loves it and highly recommends it.<br />  It works great , not real noisy, and does its job.
B0009OAGX8|5|This is an excellent product easy to put on and last a long time.  I recommend this product and vendor if you are looking for cologne for your manThis is an excellent sheild easy to put on and very durable.  I recommend this product and vendor if you are looking for cologne for your man
B00EUSMDW6|5|still waiting  I have others though and they are AMAZING  Everyone compliments me where ever I go.  Men and Women.<br /><br />Stock up because I send you lots of customers and they thank me that its from AMAZON and such a great price.  Who ever buys this product will be so, so, pleased.  I gaurentee it.
B005TT8QSK|5|Nice sweet scent
B0026HG26Q|4|Definitely works well for the price I payed. I would recommend this for sure!
B00AE078TM|4|I used this in conjunction with the frizz control shampoo by the same company, and I liked it for the most part. It did not feel greasy when applied to my hair, and it also did not seem to be too thick or too thin. It does have a pretty heavy odor, so if that is not something you like, beware.<br /><br />I let my hair dry without any other products in it to see what it looked like. My hair definitely felt clean, and on the second day, there was still no buildup which I tend to get from products like Dove. There was also no frizz, and it has been very humid in my area. The one thing I am not happy with is the lack of shine in my hair. It did such a great job of cleaning that it took away the shine. I was able to restore the shine with a blow dry and some Chi silk, but it sold be nice to air dry and have great-looking hair.<br /><br />Overall, I was still pleased with this product and would buy it.
B002G60XOY|2|Product provides a basic moisturizer at a reasonable price and didn't make my skin break out.  Giving it two stars for that.  However, I didn't notice any improvement in skin discoloration.  Also, it made my eyes tear up and my nose run.  Cannot recommend to anyone who is sensitive to fragrances.  Will not buy again.
B00EQCWCK4|5|My best seller! Looks great on lighter haired people. A nice alternative to a sometimes too intense black. Does not look purple when applied. This is a discontinued Mary Kay product.
B0001431AG|1|I've purchased this product in the past and was always satisfied.  I don't know what the manufacturer did to the product, but no matter how much water you use, the eyeliner does not adhere to the brush and is it almost grey instead of being black.
B000VUZVWQ|5|While it does not lighten hair color, it does condition and make hair follicle shine blonde in the light. Bleaching is just too unhealthy.
B0030HSD40|4|Good deal for me because I use them often. My enamel is damaged and it seems like food always gets stuck to my teeth but if I use the strips it doesn't happen plus the whitening.
B000SBGX8Y|4|this is the best cologne any man can buy it's the best
B0043OYFKU|5|I love this! It makes my face so smooth. My pores are smaller, my face is super clean, the black heads on my nose are clearing up AND it's super cheap compared to other ones out there like this. I would recommend this product!
B000E7SSCQ|5|Love this perfume!!!
B00BDJ3TCI|1|I boughT this for my daughter and turned her hair gray and black. No blue
B000RGAIHW|4|I was given this as a gift.<br /><br />It's a pretty nice pre-shave oil, very good value for money!<br /><br />Has quite a masculine scent of peppermint and eucalyptus, it certainly is not scent free as advertised.<br /><br />As for how well it works, pretty well, not as nice to use as the stuff from the Art of Shaving, but this bottle will go a lot further. It does feel a little more greasier on the hands in comparison to the above product, but it works well on your face.
B00K38JNL6|5|Great pomade!  Great scent, super strong hold. Hard to get out of your hair though.
B000052YQU|4|I would recommend to buy it at stores like Walmart, Target, Walgreens, Rite Aid and more. It cost about $4.
B009MY1PPY|1|I was hesitant but then thought for $28 at Target it was a big steep but maybe I can use over and over again and save money on going to nail salon.  WRONG.  Took over two hours to do both hands and made it inconvenient as I couldn't touch anything a I smudged it so easily on almost everything. The ultra violet light was for one finger at a time and it didn't really work as I had to do it about a dozen times for one finger and it still didn't make it completely dry!  The kit was good for only two sets and after that it was a goner so it was over priced and would of been better to just go to the salon.  I would not recommend this.
B002WTCK4G|4|My dentist told me some time ago that I was grinding my teeth and/or clenching my jaw in my sleep. I didn't believe him until a portion of my lower front tooth first appeared opaque and then broke off one day when I was eating a corn chip.     After getting the tooth repaired, I looked online for a night guard. I was hestitant to purchase this because some folks said that they bit through the device. I'm not sure now how that would be possible. I purchased this set locally for $29.99 in the sake of time. I would purchase online next time for huge cost savings.    Night guard was easy to custom fit. It stays in my mouth. I do awaken a couple of times a night when I feel the night guard. I think this must be when I have started clenching or grinding. Hopefully this new awareness will break me of the habit. If not, this solution is certainly easy to live with.
B002XQ1Y86|5|Excellent
B001TAIFZM|1|I have used lots of vitamin c serums and this is just water! No color no smell and the product was not sticky at all its vitamin c it should be kinda sticky and have a slight yellow color it clear and just water.... Don't waste ur money
B000ZIK9LC|5|My nails have never been good, and in the last few years they've become quite brittle and would split easily. I had to keep them as short as possible and even so they'd break. I've tried taking lots of biotin and other vitamins and I've used a lot of different products. Finally I came across an article that said to look for something that contained lanolin and recommended Healthy Hoof. I bought the 1-ounce container and used it twice a day. It took a while but by two months I could tell a difference. It's now been three months and I hardly recognize my nails. They don't break or split if I bump them against something and for the first time in years they are longer than the ends of my fingers. I've just bought the 4-ounce container because I've also found that the cream is wonderful for my feet - took care of my \\"sandal foot\\" soles in no time!
B001BODNYO|1|Clipper  and trimmer appears used with minor scratches. A screw fell out of the trimmer as if it was previously repaired.  Not satisfied.
B008K2EG50|5|Ooooooooooooo love it....
B00LBVVJBG|5|Got here on time and was exactly what I wanted. The &#34;training video&#34; for it was horrible though, it was like a 80's instructional video.
B001LZCX62|5|This is a natural smelling wonderful deodorant. It has a cooling effect as you apply it. Not only that, it looks so attractive in your medicine cabinet with its fresh, well-designed packaging. I love it! This is the second one I've ordered.
B000C1VW7C|5|My Wife absolutely loves White Diamonds, it's her favorite!!!! This Gift pack was a great purchase & priced well below any of the local retail stores in my area.  If your lady likes White Diamonds, I highly recommend buying this Gift Pack from Amazon,  I've not found a better deal any where yet!!!!
B00DJW3W92|5|This is stuff is amazing! It stung the first few times I used it, but once I got used to it, I saw great results. Dark circles faded and wrinkles around my eyes were diminished, within days!
B000VVT94G|5|I still have a full head of hair but I like to shave my head and have been shaving my head on and off (mostly on) for 15 years and this clipper is perfect for the look I want: Which is to shave my head as short as possible while still leaving a very, very, very slight stubble that you can still make out my hairline. And this clipper does that because it come with Wahl's shortest blade which is a 6x0 blade that cuts to .2mm. Also, the guide combs make it very easy to do multiple types of fades, if you so choose.<br /><br />And the V5000 motor that comes with this clipper is powerful and gives you a NICE, SMOOTH and VERY EVEN CUT with ABSOULUTELY NO SNAGGING or SLICING of the scalp. For those people that are complaining about slicing their scalp with this clipper, I think: 1) You're holding the clipper wrong, 2) You're using the wrong angle, 3) Your blades aren't aligned properly, or 4) A combination of one or more of those things.<br /><br />Also, for those people giving this clipper a bad review because it doesn't shave your head like Mr. Clean, use a razor blade not a clipper. Because no matter what clipper or trimmer you buy, it will NEVER shave your head like a razor blade because it has to have a bottom blade and a top cutting blade, and no matter how thin someone can manufacture the bottom blade it will ALWAYS sit between your scalp and the top cutting blade. Basically you're giving this clipper a bad review because you're expecting this clipper to do something it's not designed to do. That would be like me buying a supercharged Hemi V8 and then complaining about the gas mileage.<br /><br />Anyway, the clipper feels sturdy and well made even though it's made of plastic. And it fits comfortably in both of my hands and the power cord is much thicker and longer (8ft) than my other buzzers which is nice. And I was a little worried about the clipper heating up with its stronger motor but it stayed cool throughout my 35-40 minute shave. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this clipper for those people that aren't going for a Mr. Clean look but a really, really short shaved head. For everyone else, USE A RAZOR BLADE.<br /><br />P.S. I added a couple of pictures in the customer image section after using the 5 Star Series Balding Clipper to give people an idea how short this clipper cuts. Hope it helps.clipper for those people that aren't going for a Mr. Clean look but a really, really short shaved head. For everyone else, USE A RAZOR BLADE.<br /><br />P.S.

B0015K9BXQ|4|For what it advertises it will do, it does...it gives even, decent, cuts. I set the dial to a 2 and simply comb my head saving myself $10 from a 5min barber visit. A bit lower setting takes care around my ears. Beware though, whoever designed the power button position must have been a schoolyard jokester because it will seemingly ignite at the slightest touch like a toy handshake buzzer! Why it isn't on the upper side instead of the back for easier thumb control should be rethought. It does not seem to hold a charge either (which I understood from other's reviews) so I have to charge it before use but all in all, I've used it 4 times now so it has already paid for itself...so far anyway.
B00A8NUQY4|5|Vampire Midnight smells sweeter and lighter than Vampire, which is great since I like sweeter, lighter scents anyway. Even though I did like Vampire, if you like something secductive but not too strong, then this is for you. And this is a great gift set because you can take the small spray with you for touch ups!
B001AVY720|4|I used to use &#34;ddf benzyl peroxide gel&#34; but they changed the formula to a cream that actually made my break outs worse.  After about a week or so of research I decided to try this gel and this one works just as well for me as the old ddf gel did. I tend to get spotty breakouts (about 2-3 single but sometimes large pimples at a time)  every week to two weeks and it has taken care of my most recent breakout within 24-48 hrs, even overnight no one would know I had a problem unless I pointed it out. I would say I love it but I've only had it a couple of weeks so far so I have to make sure it continues to work: so far, so good.
B00UJ0P4PM|5|Got this as a gift for my girlfriend. She was quite pleased! She's kind of new to experimenting with makeup and wasn't even sure what all the brushes were used for!  I gave her the description that was on the item listing and that definitely helped. The brushes appear to be good quality and the case for holding them is really nice as well. Overall, very satisfied.
B000WQ7TAG|4|I have short hair so this dryer hood gets hotter than I would want it. Overall, it dried my entire head in about 30 mins. I have to cut the dryer off every so often becuase it gets hotter than I can handle but I like it. I have already recommeneded it to people who doesn't want to spedn all that money on an actual hooded dryer like I didn't. Great item to have!
B00937VHNA|5|So clean! Love the bags it comes in! Just wonderful! Perfect for body butter !  Out of 6 lbs I have only found 4 bugs! ( anyone who uses raw Shea knows that is an amazing low number!
B000JL5SGQ|5|This is one of my favorite scents! It's a clean smell and is great for every day use! I use it very often.
B00130LMC6|5|I have been using Loreal Excellence along with an additive for resistant gray.  My hair always faded during the month.  I am using medium brown.  I bought this just to try and it is the best tint ever.  It was a little too dark first day, but after one washing it was perfect and has remained that way for six weeks.  I had to touch up the roots after a month, but the remainder of the hair was perfect.  This is a great product, gray or not especially if you have a fading problem.
B000HZVS0O|4|I LIKE ALL AVON PRODUCTS. THE PRICES ARE REASONABLE ANDI HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN AND FIND NO REACTION TO THEM.
B00BYK0OA6|5|Love them!  Wish I could buy locally.
B008FOQ32W|5|😃
B000PY54RU|2|It is not Bvlgari extreme what you sent me, its the one on the picture which is a different one also by Bvlgari, much lighter
B00WCJGH54|1|I was so disappointed in my hair journey with this product for natural hair. It was not worth the money. My edges stayed down for about ten minutes and reverted back to its kinky coils. I Iam seven months in to my natural hair journey and I will not purchase any more products from this brand.
B00KY3H880|5|I have very fine, thin hair.  This dryer doesn't over dry my hair, hence less frizz. Very happy with the results.  The smaller handle makes it easier to hold on to the dryer as well.
B00BCNCKBQ|5|As far as bowls go, this is a normal bowl. It holds liquids and keeps them from spilling. However, it is much smaller than I'd anticipated. I didn't read the product dimensions, so it's my own fault. Overall, I'm happy with the quality of the bowl. I just wish I hadn't bought it because it's expensive for what it is.
B00O2A67YC|5|A Vegan facial cleanser that actually works!  Love this stuff.  Ordering again now!
B0049LUI9O|5|First, this groomer is powerful enough to get the job done. This is the first time I've used a trimmer and I love it. This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before
B000OO0EIA|5|Love this! It has no hard alcohol smell, and it also is gentle to my skin. I recommend this to everyone! It's also easy on my face.
B00NH1EONS|5|Works perfect
B00H8KOYL6|5|Didn't come with a wig cap like most wigs do, but it's a good quality wig for the price. Has a bit of a shine to it, but sprayed some dry shampoo on it and that took care of it.
B005IJTKFY|4|After one month of use i notices the change in my face and my friends are starting to notice that i look 3 shades lighter.
B004FT0V60|5|Being someone who is very familiar with Mary Kay products (I am a consultant), I expect certain standards. This exceeds those standards. Bella Belara is a light, sweet and fresh perfume and I like that. I can't wear many perfumes because they are so strong I get severe headaches and even chest pain at the worst, so you can imagine how careful I am of what I use. Bella Belara is light, but lasts, sweet and warm, but not sickly sweet and is more of a fresh scent than heavy perfumy scent. It's also versatile, you can wear it out to a party or use it for your every day scent. And it doesn't cost an arm and a leg! Definitly worth a try if you're looking for something new!
B002WJOOIQ|5|I love this lotion!  Great color!
B0019LWTQC|5|Fast service & great product. Using it to help my mare with her fly-bite sensitivity and it seems to be the only thing helping her.
B0045K1N8E|5|This product gives my nails the strength they need.  I apply it with an artist brush and it's very fast and easy.  Would highly recommend this to people with weak nails.  This little pot will last a long,long time.
B008V5E804|5|i love this lipstick!! its not as light as it looks, but its still VERY purple and i love it! good purchase!
B0000531IJ|5|buen producto
B00ACMHJY6|5|I remember wearing these as a kid and was excited to find them for my daughter. She has super fine hair and they stay in all day.
B006NZQ7C6|5|very good
B00GN8DW1M|5|Works Great!
B000X2STQ2|3|Ok product but maybe a bit overpriced for the quality
B004V465TQ|4|The color was brighter than I had anticipated but, that was a bonus. I love bright colors and this product fits the bill. And it arrived on time.
B000E7WFVQ|2|This is NOT the original Jade East.
B000BPC7HI|1|I saw this product on QVC and from the demo it looked like it really worked (of course everything looks like it works on TV).  I found it cheaper on Amazon so I bought it.  Bad move, it was a waste of money.  I tried it several days in a row, using different amounts each day and not one day did I see a difference. Spend the money on something useful like a facial, manicure or pedicure and make yourself really feel better.
B001DQEGPA|5|This is such a delightful scent.  I get a lot of compliments when I &#34;wear&#34; it.  It's definitely a scent I'm sticking with!  I recommend this product to any woman who wants compliments!
B00EXRRETG|4|Couldn't find this anywhere now that the new glycerin soaps like peach are around.  The price was right as well. I would have preferred that when delivered to the mail room, that I be notified.  Other than that I qm very happy with the product.  I have sensitive skin and this does not cause irritation for me.
B00FBQ9I24|1|I didn't order the good one......So didn't like it at all!!!
B007WR91F4|5|Loving this kit! Since starting to use it my skin has noticeably cleared up and the hyperpigmentation left from old blemishes is fading quickly.<br /><br />Only caution is that it can be very drying if used twice a day right off the bat. I had to cut back to once a day after initially using it too often, and since then my dryness had gone away and I'm still seeing great results. I may build up to twice a day again, but it might not be necessary. Also, half of one of the astringent pads is more than enough for my entire face so I've cut mine in half to make them last longer.
B006535SA8|5|I just started using Organix products, trying one here and there. I tried the body wash because it sounded like it would smell good. What I found was a clean-rinsing wash, no residue, and no drying out my skin at all; just alot of lather and squeaky clean afterwards. The smell, well it doesn't smell like coconut but boy does it smell warm and yummy. It's more like warm buttered toast with a brown sugar, or something like that. I will definitely buy it again. For me atleast, the Organix products shampoo and body washes alike all rinse cleanly away and have inviting scents. Where I live, the cost is about the same as the cost here on Amazon but selection is very limited here at home. So it's worth it to me to buy it from here. Hope this helps!!
B005UHS6C2|5|Everyone knows the best things in life have curves! Love the shape of this bottle. A little overpriced in my opinion but I couldn't find anything like it anywhere so it easily became &#34;worth it&#34;. Other than that, it's a spray bottle with &#34;spray&#34; or &#34;stream&#34; twist settings and does what spray bottles do.
B00CXUHP6W|5|I love getting the last drop out of a product and these do it, especially the smaller one,
B008GSY9IW|4|I got this several years ago and it's still going strong.  Just use it for the occasional between-haircut trim-up.  I agree that placing and removing the second layer of blades takes some dexterity when you're first figuring out how to do that.  And just know that you'll need to buy batteries for it.  I bought rechargables which I use, and those work fine.  I also got this product at an _amazingly_ low price (as an add-on item), and at that price it would be &#34;six stars&#34;, but it's priced now at more than double what I paid, so I rated four stars.
B000QTYQ6Y|5|I have always bought the mach 3 or 4 or some razors with five blades and I have had terrible razor burn on my neck for years.  I could tell the difference after the first shave and after about a week, I do not have a single bump on my neck.  I wish I had switched sooner.  I'm still trying to figure out which blades work best for me, but I love this razor.
B0083RNXOM|5|Beautiful and stuble beach hair without any stiffness. I'll purchase more in the future
B00016WURY|1|I've purchased Tea Tree from Aura Cacia before and for some reason, this one smells much different. I'm not pleased with the aroma at all, and I actually like the scent of Tea Tree essential oil. I will not be buying Tea Tree from Aura Cacia anymore. It doesn't seem like it should smell that different, especially coming from the same brand.
B00B1TKY8C|1|Hairs came out on the very first use and have never stopped coming out.  Definitely wouldn't recommend to anybody.
B00147FGJ8|1|After being down the shore about 4 days my son and fiancé have both went from cottage cheese white to BROWN....with my sons spf 80. I am using this and another spray bronzing spray that has an spf 15 since skin cancer is a very real thing. Sun poison alone sucks. But 4 days beach sun rays!!! Nothing...
B001F51RNI|5|Works
B004C6O9FK|5|This is smooth and goes on easily. I set it with a mineral powder. It covers well and lasts a long time before it gets shiny/oily. I use an oil blotting sheet and dab a little more powder on and it lasts several more hours.
B000QYCXR8|4|Nice smelling soap for the bath. Lathers well and husband enjoys it very much. Was chosen as a surprise gift.
B00VIUESAY|5|I could not believe it.  After I applied the Rosehip oil to my upper lip with the fine little wrinkles, they were gone.  The oil leaves a gentle but steady surface of softness.  It has a very gentle aroma and very nice on the skin.  This is a blue ribbon product.
B005XAUHEQ|5|This is a great product.  Yes, it has 6 rows (not 4) and it is plastic but it's still very sturdy.  I wanted a holder with a little more pattern, color to it but that doesn't seem to exist anywhere.  Since this is clear plastic, I just went and bought some craft paper and with double sided tape, I taped the paper to the back with the pattern facing toward where the nail polish will go!  Now I have a cool multi-color strip pattern to mine.  So cheap and easy!
B00M07PLMI|2|I like the fact that the products are not toxic; but the purple was not what i expected. It did not show on my skin. Maybe the purple one would show better if you are fair-skinned. I am more of a coco brown. If i decide to order again, i will try jet black.
B00JZFB13G|3|Very small compared to the real BB but it's decent. Pretty solid too.
B00028M3N2|5|I use this for a handmade bath detergent. Smells great after I clean the bath room! I love it!
B00A9I1B4C|5|I let her know to use on her feet and also to look up some other uses.
B00D63MLQY|5|LOVE all my Lisa Hoffman Bracelets and Necklaces!!!!!!
B00LTEBEYC|5|Received my sponges right away...my daughter and I love them ! They are unique ! The texture is very pleasant to the touch. I recommend! ( im the daughter) i love these!! i use mine everyday and its been a pretty long while, i dont let them soak i just wet and in my hand Nkinda squeeze them n they work great. i hang them to dry.
B0081S9ICE|5|My daughter puts tatoos on me for practice and these tribals look so cool.  I orded these and the animal ones and they work great.
B007TEY1KK|5|Plates are awesome. Images transferred well and looked great. I used the Konad special polishes and we had no problems at all.  Love the hello kitty designs, super cute!
B003AC1CES|5|I like that this shampoo adds volume to my hair (even though it is already pretty thick) and it smells really good, in my opinion.
B005MTK4RI|5|This Serum is such a deal,  I first tried  it at my Mall near by. However,  They were just trying to rip me off so bad -by trying to sell this over to me for $29 for one... I've decided to wait and my usual instinct is to look  up reviews of the product and find a better deal. Sure enough - Amazon never fails me,  Found this so much cheaper,  I just seriously love the smell, leaves my hair very soft and best used when straightening your hair or a small amount added to your hair when it is damp.
B00ES0Z206|5|Received this as a freebie, lifesavor. I am 40 years old but get terrible blackheads. I usually have to exract them everyother day.<br />With the Indias Secret wash... Left on for a few minutes, my balckheads were cleared out.<br />Keep in mind, nothing up to date can diminish a pore size, just the appearance. So my pores are still large but cleaned ou!
B005NISYDO|5|Everything was fine, a great product.
B00163QVTY|5|I have always used any nail polish, not really caring about the brand, but more about the color.  I have discovered, though, from my salon that nail lacquer is much better and lasts longer than just nail polish or nail enamel.  I noticed they were selling the OPI brand and decided to buy a few different shades to try, then found I could order the same nail lacquer from Amazon at a cheaper price.  I think this polish is much more durable, at least for me, especially since I type on a computer all the time (at home and at work) and was constantly chipping off old polish on my fingernails.  I also noticed this polish lasts much longer on my toenails as well.  I love all the color choices and appreciate the fact my salon nail technician thinks enough of the product to use it there.  Try it - you'll like it, too!
B002WTCK4Q|4|It is difficult to sleep on your side with the dental guard in there. I can't use it every night as I need to get some sleep.
B000DN7C2S|5|I love this product!  Zum Kiss makes the only lip balm that seems to work to keep my lips soft and healthy.  I've recently moved to Seattle.  It works wonders to fight off chapped lips that seems to come with the colder weather and has a wonderful scent.
B0038OGASQ|5|I love this product I finally got to trying this product, and this is perfect. It cleansed my texurized hair, and didn't strip it! I think I found my staple product &lt;3
B00WFAGPL6|5|For my observation cause i let my wife test it, well she said she love the smell of it like its not that strong , then if you will try it the product has 100% natural & organic Vitamin E oil for your face & skin - 15000 IU and it reduces wrinkles & lightens dark spots. Infused With Jojoba & Avocado Oils.This is for repairing damaged skin and reduce the effects of aging, it reduces fine lines too and wrinkles and improves skin tone and texture.
B00HUDQFZ4|2|Thin...requires much conditioner to get the job done.
B000A3ZMPA|5|it works perfectly, it does not sting, and, it removes eye make up quickly. I have used it for years
B005OPP4LQ|5|xa great way to get my favorite (albeit expensive) scent a little more economically
B00KOJ8V5I|1|I purchased this tool with great expectations to help with straightening my thick curly hair, and I am completely disappointed. It is easier to use my regular flat iron than to have my hair get tangled in the instyler wet to dry. I was expecting it to be better than the regular instyler, but the wet to dry simply isn't. If I could do it all over again, I would order the original instyler. I have used the original instyler which belongs to a friend, it worked great! Which is why I ordered one. Very different results and extremely disappointing.
B000YCOL22|5|I love this cleanser! It is so gentle, foams really well and gets all my makeup off. It really helped clear up my skin from breakouts. I used to suffer from  clogged pores, blackheads and cystic acne. This cleanser really helped take care of that.  If I see a blemish developing I use the cleanser as a spot treatment and leave it on for  5 minutes or so. It really helps stop the blemish in its tracks and reduces the redness. I got my sister hooked on this stuff too!
B001IA0PCY|5|I have an older Norelco electric shaver that otherwise works fine but the shaving heads were dull, resulting in a poor and uncomfortable shave.  These replacement heads were exact OEM replacements and my shaver is like new again.
B000ALDK1A|4|This product actually hydrates my skin.
B003POG822|5|Does wonders for damaged hair!
B00QNWNCUO|5|I have been using this moisturizer for two months and love it.  My skin seems to be softer, my pores smaller and the lines around my eyes less noticeable.  It is not greasy in the least and a little goes a long way.  After two months, I still have over half the 4 oz jar left.  I would definitely buy this product again and highly recommend it.
B00098PQPC|1|I just received my cologne which came packaged in a filthy, musty, torn box, from which someone had torn a store's price tag.  Obviously used, and obviously old.  Will return it promptly.  Yes, the shipping was more than the cost of the cologne.
B005EM6MVA|5|This whole line of products is wonderful and really does what it advertises.  You have to be patient.  It does not happen over night.
B001VEK1HQ|5|Great product! Highly recommend!
B003T4O3RA|1|I have used this product for a very long time, I used to purchased at the med spa I was going to regularly, they closed and i could not find it locally. I was happy to find it here, however, it smells really bad, it has a moldy kind of smell, I am wondering if it is an expired product. It smells like a dirty rag that was left wet and has a musky smell. Very disappointing.
B000Q58BX2|5|I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS DISCONTINUED NOW,  BUT I WISH THEY WOULD REISSUE THIS LIPSTICK .  IT IS TRULY THE<br />ONLY LIPSTICK THAT LASTS ALL DAY.
B003UH0528|5|I love this brush if had several that shed this one does not totally worth every penny. Applies foundation perfectly!!!
B005HO0ARC|5|Great Product
B001LXMI3M|5|I have had so many issue with my skin lately...<br />Once menopause hit me ... YIKES<br />It was like being a teenager again... pimples, rashes, but worse because of the added WRINKLES OF EVIL!<br />Within one week of trying this product face smoothed out<br />I especially noticed this round my eyes<br /><br />A couple of times a day... just a dab here and there and smooth it in.<br />That's it<br /><br />What made this especially wonderful was that I received a personal message from the people who own the store<br />Seems they are just a few towns over and were kind enough to send me a business card with a phone number and email address<br /><br />Super Service BTW!<br />Thanks
B000R92WNC|2|I bought this for my hair and read a review that said it's not oily and is good for fine hair. Well...no. I have thick fine hair that's colored and thirsty. This is like a grease slick on my hair and I didn't use much. Very disappointing. Especially for the price.
B0002Z8WWG|5|I think that this is the only hairdye that I have ever done myself that actually stayed. the color is so rich, and looks like you got it done at a salon. All you have to buy is the developer to mix with it. Box hairdye doesn't work as well as these professional lines. So if you are looking to dye your hair by yourself, I TOTALLY suggest this (it's cheaper than the box dyes as well). I'm very happy with the turn-out.
B003Y7D0HQ|5|All of these Premier Dead Sea products work wonderfully well.  I keep waiting to use one of the products that doesn't work as well as the one I've just tried from Premier but they've all worked fabulously.  I would recommend them all.
B001EWEPD6|5|as described
B00UM9ZTS2|5|AMAZING!!  This set of tweezers is all you need to have in your kit!  Except you will want one in your purse, at home, and at work!  The versatility of having three different tweezers for your needs is super duper!  I received this through a promotion and I am so glad as I got rid of all my other tweezers once I received these.  They also come in a nice case so that they are organized and easy to find.  I highly recommend these high quality tweezers with their versatility and usefulness!
B00BGIWIC8|3|Was a lot smaller than expected but arrived on time.
B0063KIQBG|5|I really like these headbands. They aren't too tight so they stay on my head. I will say the quality is a little on the lower end than the higher priced ones, but for the price I was impressed. I will be ordering more of these!
B00YGJYZVQ|5|I'm mo stranger to using mud masks. Years ago, I used a drug store brand that came in a tube, and was extremely drying. I most often use a dry mud, to which I add vinegar and other ingredients. In truth, it does make a mess but the results are good. I was recently asked to test a sample of ACEVIVI Spa Premium Dead Sea Mud Mask. This product gives wonderful results with absolutely no mess. You will find that it is quite concentrated as you take it from the tube. The best results are obtained by putting on not too heavy a layer and allowing it to dry for ten minutes. After following the simple directions for removal, my face felt ultra refreshed -- the texture of my skin visibly improved. This mask has a light flowery scent, and I like the fact that the ACEVIVI product has healing properties to soothe troubled skin. I really like this mask and will purchase it again in the future.
B00H93NJLS|5|I use this for my hair to fight against the winter static/ dryness and it's been working wonders. I noticed a difference after one use. Would recommend!
B001HTCYPC|2|I have been using Proactiv products for years (I am 47 and have had acne since I was 15), and I really like the cleanser/scrub, the toner and the nighttime cream, but I'm not a fan of the Green Tea Moisturizer.  Like many adults, who have acne and wrinkles to contend with, I struggle with finding a balance between moisturizing the aging skin and keeping it acne free.  I was thrilled when Proactiv introduced a moisturizer for acne-prone skin.  Unfortunately, every time I use it, my nose and cheeks explode with blackheads.  For me, I find Olay Regenerist SPF50 lotion to be the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out.
B000Q97ZS0|4|This is a good cream but I don't think is has a high enough concentration of hylauronic acid for my needs.  It is great in combination with other products and it is truly fragrance free, which is rare for skincare products.  Overall not a bad value.
B00FYJOP7G|5|For years I had been cutting plastic combs in half so that I could fit one of them inside my wallet, when I FINALLY came across this product. It's wonderful. Made of stainless steel so I can't break it. Wafer thin. And it fits inside of my new hard case wallet. Kudos to whoever came up with this product.
B002XITZ1C|5|THIS IS MY PREFERED PRODUCT.<br />AND THE PRICE IS GOOD TOO.<br />I HOPE YOU HAVE  SOME SPECIAL SALES OFFER OF THIS COOL WATER, SOON.
B00FKSWN8E|5|Hair feels amazing, back to life. Felt dry at first, took about two weeks to get my hair used to it, now it feels good. I alternate with the Wen cleansing conditioner, this saves me money.
B00BVW2M6Q|4|This item will be given as a present so I haven't tried it yet, but I was disappointed that it didn't come with English instructions only Japanese and also the charger plug doesn't fit the Australian power points. I would have expected at least an adapter and an English instruction booklet, otherwise the shaver looks good and it was delivered on time and it was well packed.<br />Thank you.<br />Cesar
B0001HYL0M|5|Purchased Model T765 because of prior experience with Model T860 by same manufacturer. Love the built-in adjustability without changing attachment shoes. So far the only difference that I can see between the old and new are in the charger, and not the trimmer. The only draw back that I can see is that rechargable batteries are not user replacable, nor were they on the old T860. I believe it's called planned obsolesence. To send unit end for battery replacement costs more than outright new replacement, hence the reason for the purchase of the new T765.
B0086LC0WG|1|They didn't come in a container. and they fell apart. I had to throw over half of them away. I wouldn't buy again.
B004W17O7A|3|I've ordered these before to use as shaving brushes and they're great, but this order only came with 1 brush (though the description says 2).
B00F3P86J4|5|These things are gorgeous!!! I didn't realize all the pigments have a shimmer, but still works for me. I'm only in the beginning stages of doing makeup on myself, so maybe I don't know anything... But my selfies are cute (my opinion counts to me)
B000KHIDSY|5|Better Botanicals Kokum Butter Body Balm has been a main stay for over 10 years.  Originally, I used the Better Botanicals Body Blend in the summer and the Kocum Butter in the drier winter months.  Now, it is used daily all year long.  I am surprised by the comments on fragrance, I am sensitive to fragrances and find this quite mild.  Any fragrance disappears immediately after applicaton.  The Kokum butter lotion moves easily over the skin and leaves no residue.  Used directly after a morning shower, it keeps the skin moist for the entire day.  Over the years, I have used other products when traveling or when received as a gift.  I always return to Better Botanicals...it is the best!
B00R31J4H4|5|Love it! Thanks
B00F63TA9I|5|Very pretty color.  It's not even close to the color it appears to be in the photo.  It's about four shades darker and has a pretty sparkle.
B000GHVLPU|5|good smell
B0098JX402|5|This is a wonderful after shave. It is just a bit bitter on the skin and it leave a fresh sensation for long time, the scent also is good.
B00A6OR7N8|3|I like the color of this product but it doesnt last for 7 days as it states it does last for a day.  I would say if you like to tint your eyebrows you can use this to get the shape you want and then use tint over it and it works wonders that way.  It is very easy to use and I like the color it is just like the pencils I use.  I would buy another even though it doesn't last 7 days it still works with my tint which I love!
B004WGNAL4|3|I used to wear this perfume religiously. They yanked it out of all of my local stores a couple of years ago, so I stopped wearing it. I was so excited to find it on Amazon! I ordered a bottle, and something has changed. Not for the better.<br /><br />Tibetan Mountain Temple used to smell like incense with base notes of pumpkin pie and a tiny bit of patchouli. I smelled delicious. Like hippy-ish baked goods. It was spicy, just a tiny bit sweet, and not terribly overpowering. 2 squirts would last me all day and wouldn't break my nose.<br /><br />Now it smells like I rolled in a spice cabinet. I wore this perfume when I was first dating my husband five years ago and he loved it. Now it makes him sneeze. For some reason, it has an overpowering clove smell. Honestly, it smells a bit like clove cigarettes, which is kind of nice, but not something I want to wear.<br /><br />I'm going to leave the bottle in direct sunlight and see if that helps. Otherwise I'm just going to toss it. Which is sad, because I used to love this scent.
B00AE07GX0|3|I don't often use hair products but when I do my goal is one easy product that does everything I need. I usually want some volume at the root and shine, nothing too fancy. I have a bit longer than shoulder length, color treated straight hair. I was looking forward to making this Nexxus plump and lift blow dry spray my go to product, but it didn't really cover all the bases for me.  I follow the directions and applied it to towel dried hair, worked it through and blow dried upside down for lift. It definitely \\"plumps\\" and makes my hair look fuller, but doesn't give me the volume I'm looking for. Beyond that, I still needed a shine serum as this felt like it dulled my hair rather than improve it. It wasn't super sticky, but was more \\"product-y\\" feeling than the [[ASIN:B00778LTDU Garnier Fructis Style XXL Body Thickening Mousse, Ultra Strong Hold, 6.8 Ounce]] I typically use. I like my hair to look great but have no noticeable gunk in it. I'm going to stick with that just because it's more affordable and it works better for my hair with good bounce, soft to the touch volume and shine.
B00ABC55UM|5|I bought one for my mom for Christmas and it does what it advertises.<br />It makes taking care of callouses a breeze she even uses it on my Dad's rough elbows.
B0047ENV42|1|wish i can give it NO STARS<br /><br />Looks nothing like the product in the image! also came broken!!<br /><br />i do not reccomend this product!! just aweful!!
B004CCUA2U|5|DIdn't realize I already had one of these when I purchased it, so was disappointed in that. I don't feel I see much difference from other similar products. But, to be honest I don't do enough polishing to be a great judge on this one!
B000UK16AI|2|The shaving heads cut at best ok, however many passes have to be made to get a real close shave.  The replacement unit falls off easily while shaving.  I would not recommend
B006GDB518|5|So many fun things to do with this product. Still finding more each time I use it. And I have been using it for everything. I do a lot of crafting and it makes a great stiffener or sealer depending what I am working with.
B000ISD4QG|5|Goes on easily and really works. I've been using Ban for over 20 years and I've always like it. When I try other products, I'm usually disappointed and come back to Ban. It costs a bit more but it's worth it.
B002K8QUBS|5|I had been using the Tom's of Maine whole care line for a while, but my dentist said I should switch to the sensitive product if I'm going to use a more natural toothpaste.  I think he and the hygienist were worried it was too abrasive for my teeth.  I have sensitive teeth, so this product has helped since I can't notice my teeth being that sensitive anymore.  One thing I really appreciate about ordering this 6 pack is that the expiration date is 1 year and 9 months away.  So, my family of 2 will be able to go through all of these tubes before they expire.  Thanks Amazon!!
B00BOJ9WL4|5|THE BEST AND MADE IN THE USA
B0043DMNHS|4|Works quietly and smoothly.<br />A little disapointed from the knife in the side. Forgot it's name<br />It is very weak.
B004232R9S|5|I love this size of purity... I travel a lot ...and it's take off the make-up...great...thank you so much!!!<br />The price is reasonable and it shipped very quickly...
B00EXK0TLI|5|Great price and I received them quite quickly
B007AII2R8|5|They are small, and perfect for using in my nail art, only thing I must say is I wish there was a yellow tinted or gold tinted star. I wanted to make a rainbow but I am one color short, I still love them though!
B00710WP3W|5|Great product with benign effects on healthy. I just feels natural, with pleasant fragrance.
B000OYLBJG|4|I have always loved Hemps lotions, the new scent is fresh!<br />Leaves skin smooth and feeling healthy. I would buy again!
B001F5YL40|5|MAC Rice Paper eye shadow is the perfect base color for a warm complexion.  It blends well, always goes on smoothly, and never clumps in the deep fold of the eye lid.
B001G7OCSM|4|Excellent product!  The other Proactive products irritated my skin but this works well for spot treatments and also as a weekly mask if your skin is oily.
B0075CI4D6|3|I bought almost a year now. And light it seen no longer work as before. ( less bright) . So anyway that I can fix or change the light inside ?
B00CBVJKOS|5|Nicely blends into the skin and prevents creasing; basically does its job pretty well
B000FYVOJC|5|use it to trim my nose and i love it, i can breathe a lot better and my hair doesn't come out my nostrils when i smile... lol
B00DL77W0A|5|Very good product..no tears or burning and gets most of the eye makeup off before using the cleanser.
B001BO0KMC|5|This curling iron lived up to and beyond my expectations.  Gets very hot, even on medium setting.  Perfect size for just about all lengths of hair.  I wish I had ordered 2.
B00FDMGOB4|5|was very impressed
B00724JMQK|5|Just like the one in all the fancy stores, but with one thing missing....the big price tag! This is the only thing my Dad will wear and I have always gotten it from Belk or Dillards. But I decided to give this a try and I'm glad I did! It was the real thing and my Dad loved it.
B001GQ3GF8|1|This is the worst Wahl Product that I have ever used in 40 years! The rechargable battery is a joke! I couldn't even make it through a hair cut after the second recharge. I should have sent it back immediatly but I decided to give it a chance. Now, after less than 12 attempted hair trims, the only way it will work is to leave it plugged in, and it still does a crappy job. I have bought Harbor Freight clippers for $7 that were way better than these. I can't believe Wahl accually sells these things! I am not sure if I can trust any Wahl clippeers after these! The twistable head would be great if it continued to work for moe than the amount I uuse it. I use a Flowbee to cut my hair and I bought these to trim up the edges. I lost. They are Crap, Crap, Crap!
B00H0FBV0G|5|This compact makeup brush set is by far the most used and most handy thing in my handbag, I always make 100% sure that it is with me wherever I go! The five brushes in this set are of top quality, better than any I have ever used and are angled and shaped to perfection! The fibers of these brushes live up to their name, soft as a feather, and caring for them couldn't be easier! After each wash, these brushes return back to their exact original form and silky soft texture. The smaller brushes give me perfect lines with each use and the bigger brushes ensure an all round smooth and flawless application of the relevant product. The case is chic and the perfect size to put into any bag and take along to touch up any look anywhere! I love my FEATHERSTROKE brushes!
B00027D0DU|5|As good as my lancome
B00JBCJ5VI|3|Took forever to recieve.....they work as they should.
B0009XH6TG|1|the cord does not fully retract - making it worthless
B006O8PGH4|5|I first purchased Royall at Brooks Brothers.  It is a very peasant but masculine scent.  The name attracted me because I am a former rugby player.
B00CBYG228|5|best i have found
B003ATTO6E|5|Perfect brush stiff enough to smooth my thick hair into a ponytail.
B002XQ1YDG|3|It smells nice, but too strong so I gave it to my brother.
B00O2PBDCI|4|This serum is really great, and has all the right ingredients, but the only thing I keep finding in these serums is witch hazel. I know that witch hazel can be beneficial to the skin, as I am an Esthetician, but for someone with dryer, sensitive skin, daily use can cause peeling, and irritations. Its great to use in moderation, but long term daily use is not recommended. The ingredients in this are great, don't get me wrong. I love the texture, the way it feels on my skin, and I have noticed these deeper lines I have on my forehead are really light now, and almost gone. Ive noticed a significant difference in my skin, and as long as I just use this every other day with a heavier moisturizer, its fantastic. I would definitely use this product on my clients that have oilier or problematic skin.
B001MA0QY2|5|I love my iron, is the perfect size and in just few minutes I get my hair done!<br /><br />Just love it :)
B00KOU21OY|1|Dollar store earrings quality.
B002NCVIQ8|5|Used it all up, want more, but it's too expensive.
B005C1C02S|1|This deffinetly not what it looks. like. These look like little diamond like things with different shapes. It actually looks like cheap junk, and nothing like fake diamond or rhinestone. And by the time I got them, they were all out of the container and all mixed up. I will not be using these, they will go straight into the garbage. Looks like something for a little girl. I will not every buy anything out of country, or from this seller again.
B00HMEBRKO|5|I was surprised at the quality for the price. This is my first safety razor and I think I made the right choice for my first one.
B004U3ARC4|3|I like them because they leave kind of a shield across my forehead. I wish I could wear them all day! unfortunately, I look like a zombie! Need something a little more extreme. Didn't really take care of the wrinkles.
B00CHCM4P8|5|This conditioner is amazing!!  I already had the shampoo and so when I purchased the condtioner, I knew what to expect. It is so rich and it realy detangles my hair. My hair is very thick and curly and it is so soft, healthy and manageable after I'm done using the conditioner. The smell is also great. My hair and scalp look very clean and healthy after use. It definitely is a good quality product. I usually use a leave - in  conditioner afterwards to maintain the softness.
B008BMGLLQ|1|I hate it, worst wig ever. I purchase this because I am in bed rest until my twins arrives, and what a dissapointment sadly returning it is a challenge since I can't go and do it myself,so I am stuck with this crap.
B00BC3ASQA|5|I really like this color. Perfect for the summer months. It does require two coats but the end product is pretty!
B0054Y0PMK|5|Looking forward to using it after I have finished my my old one. This is a new formulation so I hope it's an improvement on the old one. If it's Nioxin, it's gotta be good!
B003V37Z6U|5|In case anyone wanted to know why they are so expensive now: A Philips support rep asked me to purchase an RQ10 instead of the RQ12 because they're not making the RQ12.<br /><br />The rep assured me that the RQ10's have the same features now as what the RQ12 had.  I'm not sure if the rep really knows what's going on, but it seems clear that Philips has either discontinued or has temporarily stopped producing the RQ12 product.<br /><br />I cannot say whether the RQ10 manufactured today is as good or better than or as feature rich as the last RQ12 I've used.  I can say that the RQ12 shaves better than the RQ10 I had 3 years ago and is the reason I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Give Philips a call and let them know what you think of this. I did.<br /><br />Shave on!<br /><br />EDIT: just about everything...
B009GLPJ5U|4|This is my second day using it. It has staying power thus far. I purchased it on a whim based on other reviews. I'm not dissatisfied so far. One thing though; my brush is hard to clean now. Any suggestions as to how to get it off of my brush bristles properly? With the other gel product I was using, it came off the bristles just fine. With this product, no beuno! Helllppppppppppppp! I think I like it, but this was surprising to me.
B00UASJ120|5|First off, this bottle is different than other brands of Argan Oil that I have tried recently because it comes in a spray bottle as opposed to a pump or dropper style.  This spray bottle allows for easy application no matter where you use it.  It absorbs quickly and is so lightweight there is no greasy residue or heavy buildup to clog your pores.  Argan Oil is such a multi-functional oil that leaves your hair and skin so soft and luxuriously smooth.  I like to use it in my hair as it really helps to tame frizz.  I recommend it for all skin and hair types.<br /><br />**I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest review**
B005QG52F6|1|Enhances & defines Curls.  Leaves white cast. No shine. Product too light for natural thick hair.  Have to apply every day.  Will have a dry afro in the morning.
B007146A16|5|EXCELLENT PRODUCT COMES A TIME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION VERY RESPONSIBLE SUPPLIER, WE RECOMMEND 100% WHAT YOU FOR YOUR KINDNESS CERTIFY
B000BF1396|5|I have used this cleaner since I received my new shaver and it works just as advertised.  I change it once a week and I NEVER have any facial problems.  Another plus most shavers smell after awhile with this cleaner I never have that happen.
B005UKZAJG|5|I was a little worried about purchasing this item at first. Every time I see big makeup sets like this, I am very worried about the quality. However, I have purchased other products from Shany Cosmetics before and I was very pleased with them! Decided to just go for it... And so happy that I did! This is a great makeup set for anyone and everyone with very professional grade products!
B006MK4XTG|4|parfum box is broken
B00EEIM0OS|4|Love this brush and definitely worth the cost.  So much better than a loofah.  Will purchase another when needed
B00OTJDED8|1|I hated the small daddy long legs &#34;bump its&#34;.  They don't &#34;bump&#34; anything. What a disappointment! And, I waited and waited for them to be delivered! What a bummer!
B000NL0T1G|5|I've been using this for almost 6 months and I wish I would of made the switch sooner.  The razor is solid and good quality.  I dry take mine apart and dry it out every time I use or else it gets water marks on it.  This will give you a nice close shave for a fraction of the cost of the multi blade razors.  I would buy a few different blades to find which one works best for you because they are all a bit different.
B002DPUY06|5|I don't use Chapstick often because I have a bad habit of always licking it off because it tastes good but this Chapstick doesn't make me want to lick it off. It doesn't taste bad or anything it actually doesn't really have a taste. The Chapstick itself is really good to use and will leave and keep your lips moist.
B00198ZOU8|5|I love this product. Better then using a sock lol. It's pretty easy as well. I do not struggle at all to put it on. I love it.
B00D0NO1KE|5|This is my second order of this polish and I ordered 2. The color is not too bold so I can wear it almost all the time. It does last and the color is perfect for me I am very fair.
B005F784SI|5|I love this cream for my face..try the small one first for yourself..
B004NYWR7S|4|Nice vibrant colors! Smell is a little over whelming.
B00E19GG8Q|5|Very nice colors for the price and came fast in the mail. While they don't cover well by themselves I use a plain color as a base and just add 2 layers of this on top and it looks perfect. And while others are saying they aren't very duochrome I think they're wonderful, as long as the light hits them just right.
B005T53M5Q|2|All the nail Polish was completely dried up. There wasn't enough brushes for the different items. My little girl was disappointed
B008FMJT5C|5|It really works, can't stop using it specially that my lips are always dry and dryness is really painful I strongly recommend it to anyone in my case
B00AHAWWO0|5|I hope this review helps you. I always depend on reviews when I shop. I have used the &#34;non professional&#34; strips a few times in the past, and they are okay. But these things are great. The others were thin and flimsy and hard to get on my teeth and hard to keep in place when talking. Not these. They have more body to them. They keep the cleaning agent in place longer. They stay where they belong even when talking. And they whiten. I mean they really whiten. Maybe it is because they stay in place longer. But I will never use the others again.
B001VB8C2U|5|I have tried 3 different brands of estriol. This one is the best IMHO. I have no more hot flashes, feel less emotional, makes great face cream (seriously), and here is the TMI: felt like intimacy for 1st time in years. Price is right too.
B00NF8967W|1|Made skin greasy & break out on face!
B002654TEK|3|I have used peppermint foot products in the past that were really good.  The peppermint and/or menthol really cooled by feet down.  However, with this it has just a small amount of peppermint and just feels like thin foot lotion.  Disappointed!
B00V7TI9JC|1|Waste of money. It is like putting glue on your skin. It looked like a mask when it dried. I used it twice. Threw the rest away.
B0041E9NMC|5|This product worked in less then 7 days with no sensitivity! I had my teeth whitened before at the dentist and felt great sensitivity. Love Venus Ultra!
B00424NC4G|1|Ink was thin and didnt stay in the skin
B00BBF39OM|5|I own a skin care shop and i used their products i love this peel its great for people who never experince a peel before its light and you still get great results.
B000F4IL70|1|The smell is absolutely awful. It reminds me of a molded bathroom or rotten fruit. It was that bad that I had to wash it off my hair immediately. Am I missing something here? Am I the only one who doesn't like it?
B0041OUAIS|4|The bristles have fallen out on me. It does give good coverage, though! Worth the $12.00 compared to $20 something...
B00OPCD10U|3|Pretty good.
B00GY2B6NS|4|I generally like this anti-perspirant/deodorant.  First, it does a very good job protecting against wetness.  Sometimes I feel as if my underarms have gotten damp, but when I check, I am always dry.  As a deodorant, I think it does a decent job.  What is a bit problematic is that the scent of this product is rather odd--I actually found it to smell a bit like balsam fir, a fragrance that I like, but not on my armpits!--and when mixed with body odor, the resulting scent is not particularly pleasant!<br /><br />One thing that I do NOT like about this product is how it tends to become flaky.  It goes on smoothly (unless your underarms at even the tiniest bit damp), but it has a tendency to flake off, especially when I am exercising.  Also, the container itself becomes VERY messy, with excess product constantly flaking around the cap--this was a huge annoyance!  For these reasons, I would give this product a 3 1/2 star rating, and I would not purchase this again, although I might try something else in the Dove line.
B001RVMQX0|3|I was wondering why the price was low, Looks like old products or products who's exp dates are approaching. Since its for personal consumptions will test and use them fast. There were scratches on not just the top of the packing, but scratches on the bottle inside too.
B005HO0AR2|5|I have children who suffer from eczema.  Other soaps cause their skin to break out in bumps or become scaly.  Dove does not.  It is part of the solution we use for sensitive skin.<br /><br />I will say that left in the stream of water, this bar will disappear more quickly than typical soap.
B00C7DYBX0|5|Second time purchased, can't go without.
B00176V2SK|4|Gotta say, I had a Panasonic once before in late high school...and it was a cheap model which was ok, but the foil broke and it was hard to find a replacement.  That was over 10 years ago.  Since then I've been using a Mach 3 Power shaver and while I liked the close shave, I would get plenty of nicks and cuts on my neck.  Even recently after doing research on shaving tips, I would still get nicks and cuts.  With frustration boiling over, and seeing these good reviews, I had to give in and buy an ES8228S.      It's been about a week now, and I am loving it more each day.  The best part is I don't get cuts anymore.  The shave is close and I am getting better at the angles and applied pressure to get it closer each day.  For the most part, the shave is great, just a couple areas around my neck and left side of my face (since I am right handed, I just gotta get the angles better as it's bigger to hold then the Mach 3).      I really gotta say how much I love the docking system.  I can choose whether I want to clean the shaver, clean and charge it, just dry it (if I cleaned it myself), or just charge it (which is great because I can get full use of each charge).  There are many combinations you can choose from.  The convenience is great as when I am in a rush in the morning, I just pop the shaver in the dock and forget about it.    A couple minor issues for me is how loud it is when I am shaving near my sideburns.  Another gripe is the time it takes to cleaning system to work.  It seems excessive and not efficient.  I think the manual said it takes a little over 2 hours.    Overall, a great shaving experience and would recommend to anyone else.
B004GCVQM4|5|This is a nice, long-handled brush.  These brushes of this quality are hard to find in stores for this price.
B0027TUJ4E|5|So glad I finally found a new flat iron with a 2 inch width plate - makes straightening my hair a 5-minute job! This product is thin, quick, and efficient. Can't believe I found it for half the price of the smaller-plated ones in the stores!
B00J2S5A0G|3|got frizzy after 1 wear, bangs make it look weird
B004ARO3LQ|4|I like the Zoya formulation and when combined with a good top coat it will last awhile. The color &#34;Elodie&#34; is a lot more orange than I was expecting, definitely not the pretty pink in the picture.
B004SSRSRS|4|I bought this for a friend as her bday present. I can't really comment beyond that. I'm sure she likes it as she placed them on her wish list.
B000B8YZQG|3|Works well on mobilizing excess arm fat; tightening of the skin is less dramatic.  It may be hard on the skin if you have any skin senstivity.  My daughter's skin remains very red after using it for a few weeks.
B002DP75R6|5|This was the too faced product that impressed me the most. it fills the fine lines and gives you a beautiful even surface to work on.
B00488A9VU|2|Don't really care for the offset floss design nor the super flimsy pick end.  Trying something else.
B0020MMCB6|5|This is the best electric razor I have ever used! A nice, smoothe shave and very easy to use--------much better than the Norelco it replaced. I understand the battery can be replaced when needed (unlike Norelco) so you do not have to throw away the razor when it runs down.
B003PL3K8U|1|After less than 5 minutes on my face this product left me with a bright red chemical burn. 2 hours later and it's obvious that the damage is done and I'm going to have peeling skin in the morning. Very disappointed to say the least.
B00J3C9O1M|5|I love it  and very please I have other flat  ionic and did not like them. I had one six year and have not  found  one  in tall this one so thank you
B001DEYP8K|1|I have used numerous electric shavers in the past including another model by Remington and this is the worst shaver by far! Not only does this shaver provide a subpar shave, it does so unevenly. It nicked me more than a shave with a razor blade and left my neck red and sore, without shaving away all the wiskers found there. It is not much better on or around ones chin. This shaver's head is too large to handle tight areas. It is not much more than a noisy vibrator. My previous shaver, which is three year old, provides a better shave that this brand new Remington. Very disapointing product.
B002MWS3Y4|5|Fantastc scent, great size that lasts for years
B000C21064|5|Ever since Hurricane Katrina, my boyfriend lost this favorite cologne of his and hasent been able to find it at any store. So I bought it for him (from you) and he hasent stopped thanking me or asking where I got it. Thanks so much!
B00JVVC8IG|5|This goes on so smoothly and looks great. Feels light and not heavy like some foundations.
B0015KHMRS|1|It won't let me purchase 2 of them!!!??? I guess either my son or my husband is not getting one! :((
B000DIN39Y|5|I can't dare to imagine the number of body lotions that I have tried in 50 years....aaagh...this is my favorite (next to Moroccan Oil body souffle, though it is not as rich and hydrating, but love the MO scent!).  This lotion is hydrating, smells fantastic and leaves a lovely finish, but not oily.
B0032ANCVE|5|The product is a winner. Beware the illusion of getting a deal online, average price in stores is a bit over 2 dollars per can!Amazon does not sell this directly and some sellers are daring to charge almost 7 dollars per can!
B000GCKBUQ|2|While these help some, they slip out of place quite frequently and end up in my socks or elsewhere. Only one of the 3 sizes worked for me.
B001BIXLVU|1|I have used this shampoo before and it was really good, but the bottle I received was water down. It doesn't do anything. Not the same product at all!
B001V9SXXU|4|Our entire family uses this product. Our skin types are normal to extremely dry and chapped. This product works really well for normal skin and helps my extremely dry skin feel soft
B004TS9ZXW|4|i took a chance ordering a product I've never heard of and with only 1 review, but...I love this moisturizer. I love how this makes my very dry skin feel. I have tried just about every moisturizer out there and nothing makes my skin as soft and supple as this. It's very thick and creamy, but doesn't leave me feeling greasy like some other \\"dry skin\\" moisturizers do. And a little goes a long way.  The only thing I dislike about it is the scent. It smells like \\"old lady\\". It's not a bad smell (it is strong at first but fades after a while), but reminds me of how my great grandmother always smells, her perfume and body powder. I think next time I'll order the sensitive formula and see how it is.   Otherwise this stuff is wonderful!
B00MU2493U|5|product met expectations
B001JJBC9Y|5|This clipper is very sturdy and seems to be well built. I plan on using it a lot in the future
B00PATJOL2|5|I have not purchased this product on Amazon but I have bought it at a drug store and really love the produc t! I have natural curls and it holds but isn't stiff or sticky it also smells nice. I would definitely give this product a try.
B00DT6MWRQ|5|This busy mom of two never writes reviews but I feel compelled to share this fantastic discovery of Rootflage with everyone. Life is busy, and us moms hardly ever slow down long enough.  In between volunteering at school; taking the kids to soccer practice; helping with homework; making dinner; etc. life happens. Rootflage is practical, easy to apply, and in seconds I feel as if I stepped out of the salon. This will be a great stocking stuffer!
B000XT87O4|5|I LOVE this color and formula. I've bought the same brand but different colors but Amber is amazing. It is a very sheer, shiny color and pumps like no other. It doesn't taste like cinnamon unlike others I've tried which is great because I don't like cinnamon. I buy a few tunes at time because I go through it so fast.
B000H88QOM|5|Works wonders for your hair!  Nice, light spray in a handy pump.  Easy to comb through & not sticky. Highly recommend.
B004IM0KYM|5|My dry, itchy scalp now feels normal and my dandruff is very reduced. I know this product makes no claims to do this, but it's true. I leave each product on my scalp for 2-3 minutes before rinsing. Try this product every day for two weeks, then go back to your normal routine. You won't be disappointed.
B00B1DATW4|5|I LOVE ITTTT, amazing, just like tha picture, gorgeous, so cute, and sparkle, and pink,( ESPECTACULAR, tal cual la foto, bellisimooo, me encanto quede completamente conforme)
B00BB3JZJW|5|I like the product. I have extremely long hair so it is a little expensive. I braided my hair and sprayed it with this Sea Salt spray, left it in over night. When I combed my hair out it was beautiful and stayed wavy for 2 days.<br /> I might try to make my own, I've seen a lot of recipes online for homemade.
B00ALI4BYM|5|Awesome product  great for summer. No oily or heavy feeling when dry. Makes hair soft and manageable
B0016BN4YQ|4|Serves the purpose. It can be termesd as complete body groomer though philips claims it just for facial use.    drawbacks -   Do not have univeral power supply. You need to purcahse step down converter to use this outside US.  I wished if beard shaver attachment was little more wider, so I could have complete shave faster.
B0084HRIRE|5|I upgraded my Proactiv face scrubber some time ago, and purchased these as additions. This is a much better brush than the original item.
B002VECJXY|5|I love this eyeliner and can not find it in stores anywhere.  This is a great color and this is one of very few eyeliners I have found that do not run all over my eyes.  It seems to last a long time also.  I have used this product now for a few years and will continue to use it as long as I can find it.  I am really happy that I can purchase it through Amazon.
B000FEGUIM|4|I've had this razor for a few months, and it gives a great, close shave.  My only issue with the product is that the battery life fails to live up to its promises.  It claims 25 minutes of cordless shaving, but my personal experience has been closer to about half that.  I don't travel much, so the razor usually just stays plugged in in the bathroom, but I am still disappointed that Philips Norelco makes such an exaggerated claim on its product.  Despite this, I am quite pleased with the product as a whole.
B006WBPVNW|5|I have a wide bathtub and was having a difficult time finding a caddy that extended wide enough.  This one did. Works great, although the wire book prop isn't the best. Nice looking, well made, and seems like it will last quite a while.  Very reasonably priced when compared with other bamboo products that are so often overpriced now that bamboo is fashionable. This is a keeper.
B000FNSM3Y|5|This item was excellent! It is very inexpensive but a very high quality product. I would recommend this product to my colleagues.
B000NHTYPM|4|The Barrette clip does the trick . Daisy is a Bearded Collie and has hair that obscures her vision. I thought I was ordering one clip but instead it turned out to be 100 !!!!.( My fault for not reading the small print.) It is well made and doesn't come undone.
B00BD822BI|5|I REALLY love this cream....it is helping already and only used 3 days!!!<br />A little goes a long way, and my skin already feels so much softer.  I can tell I will be a LONG time customer of this product.  I love the fact it is all natural oils as well...using twice a day right now, but will probably only need once a day in a week or so.  Thanks much for such an AWESOME product!
B004X9BSIC|2|I will say that it hydrates. But it does not lift. I have read all of the horror stories about unscrupulous vendors marketing this as some kind of miracle. I feel sorry for anyone who paid more than 20 bucks for this. Or for any of the products in this line. Though they are not bad, they are not worth hundreds of dollars a jar! But then I don't think there is any topical skin care that is!<br />I would probably purchase it again at the Amazon price, because it is very hydrating and seems to hold the moisture to your skin for a few hours, which is great for older skin.<br />I gave it only 2 stars because it is not what it claims to be
B001MA0QY2|5|I love this hair straightener. I had previously been a loyal Chi devotee, but when I accidentally lost mine on a trip and needed a replacement, I searched Amazon and found this one on sale at a seemingly too-good-to-be-true price. But I took a chance and ordered it.<br /><br />AND I AM SO HAPPY I DID! This straightener is amazing and leaves your hair really smooth and shiny in addition to the normally expected functions of a flat-iron. For this price and at any comparable pricepoint to the Chi, I'd highly recommend this HSI instead.<br /><br />Love!
B00KNJOLSA|5|The first thing I noticed when I put it on my face was there was a feeling of cooling. It did not burn my skin like so many other types of masks have. Also, it tightened my skin the more it dried and somehow also left my skin feeling like I had just used moisturizer. I felt a tingling on my nose where it was working on cleaning out my pores. I just really loved how this product felt. When I washed it off, even though I had put on a thick layer, I did not have to scrub to get it to come off. Once I had washed my face, I noticed how firmer my face felt and it also felt tighter around my eyes. I loved that feeling.
B000B65EYK|5|It is a man's cologne  no perfumery smell  and a great skin bracer. My wife has a very sensitive  noise and this fragrance doesn't bother her a bit i had to give up wearing aftershave for years until i found this
B008YLLTK2|5|I use Toppik regularly. The travel size is perfect for travel or for first time buyers who want to try it but dont want to waste their money on the larger size. It is how I got started on Toppik. I bought the travel size first, loved it, and now I buy the large size.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|I've been using Sonicare since the early 90's.  I never floss, yet I'm always told at the dentist I have no plaque.  Sonicare also tightens up my gums so they cling closer to my teeth, and whenever I have a sore spot on my teeth or gums, I apply the Sonicare for a few minutes twice a day, and the problems clears up.  This is because the sonic waves eliminate bacteria causing the infection.
B003NN06KK|5|This is a great pacifier, but you should know some things. FYI: I bought the Pink W/ Flower paci.    First, the front of this has a hole to let air in and out of the bulb. The hole's small, so it makes a little squeak when baby sucks. For most people, this is adorable, but it's also very easy to let this give you away if you're trying to be incognito. If this is a problem for you, like it was for me, you can expand the hole with hand instruments like a Leatherman to expand the hole so it doesn't. This doesn't affect the paci in any way, unless you're a klutz or you don't know what you're doing...    Second, the nipple is rubber, so it might be dehydrating. On first use, it's really dry, but afterward it's smooth and wonderful, so it's not really a problem later on.    Third, the nipple might be slightly skewed, so the outside bit will look off when baby's sucking on it. For most people, this isn't an issue, especially because the rest of this product is very good quality.    The bulb is 1 1/4\\" by 1 1/4\\" by 1/2\\". The part before the bulb, the part that passes the teeth, is 1/2\\" by 5/8\\" by 1/4\\". The width of the outside is 2 1/2\\" at its widest part.    The bulb hugs the tongue, like most good baby pacifiers do. It's not just a round thing in the mouth, it's engineered by the good folks at NUK to be professional quality.    For those who haven't used pacifiers before...they're wonderful. They're so soothing, they give the feeling like you can just relax completely, that Mommy and Daddy will take care of everything and you don't need to worry. I love it.    All in all...I LOVE IT!
B000NBQUNW|4|My cholesterol was getting high, so I decided to try Benecol.  In one month, it went down 20 points.  I'll get another check-up in the spring and hopefully it'll be further down.
B00OH3W1U8|5|Water transfers. This will be great on edge as shown or cut up to lacy and polka dots.  Nice detail on decal.
B004D1SFRC|1|I feel like someone just threw acid on my head! Clarol are you kidding??? I started coloring my hair when I was a kid, so I've been doing it about 30 years. I've tried all kinds of products. Once in a long while I might feel a little tingling, but NOTHING like this!!! I had to wash it out after 5 minutes, because it was burning my head so badly. I'm praying my hair doesn't fall out.<br />I usually read Amazon reviews before I try something new, but didn't this time. Normally, I get L'Oreal's foam product which doesn't burn and doesn't dry out my hair, but it was $2 more. This time, I'm sorry I was such a Cheap Chick! Seriously Clarol, you need to take this off the market or put a HazMat label on it.<br />P.S. It's been 20 minutes & my head still hurts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002VD66RA|5|I've been looking for nail dotting tools and took a chance on this set.  It costs a little more than other nail dotting tools listed on Amazon but after comparing pics of what was offered this seemed to have a good selection of sizes.  The shipping was fast because of Amazon Prime and well packed.  The tools themselves are beautiful and work very well.  I was so happy with my purchase and glad that I spent a few dollars more for a quality set
B000Z6062Q|5|i used to always use a razor for my neck as my religion doesn't allow razors  on the face, and an electric shaver for my face. i always struggled to find the perfect combo until now, and this was the missing peaice, very happy with it, well worth the cost. its expensive, but almost everything in life that is good and far superior to the competition is more expensive, right?
B00HNKQTZU|5|About 2 years ago, I switched over to Axe products and have rarely been disappointed since. This product is no different. This particular product is a deodorant and not anti-antiperspirant; therefore, while it will not stop or otherwise reduce perspiration, it will prevent bad odor (actually mask). In this regard, the product performs very well providing about 12 hours of odor control in the form of a slight citrus ginger smell, not as overpowering as some others.  The product applies evenly and does not stain shirts. Also, it appeals to my wife quite a bit.
B007ZT6J1S|5|well my skin is really mix i have pro acne skin is dry in some areas but my t zone is oily so i was looking for something that works good on oily skin and i found this i was really surprised the color fits perfect to my skin the coverage is pretty good so im really pleased with this product also they gave me sample of niph aura and they look lovely together the perfect match i love it
B0000C92GQ|2|Not very effective as it misses if hair is not inside it's cone.
B002JIJS86|5|I received it right on time, product in perfect order. Thank you
B00EOB0042|5|Great all natural deodorant.  My wife purchased this product, and she absolutely loves.  Great size for travel as well.
B0034KYDQU|5|for sucha  price, it has everything a girl needs for a travel kit<br />easily packed and not worried of forgetting a thing<br />nice colors to match all too
B0017JT23Y|3|I could not believe my eyes when I saw how small the bottle was.  It said .17, I guess I thought it was 1.7, so that shocked me, but the fragrance is good,  I'd never spend $16 on something so small.  They give samples for free at the department stores.  But, I do enjoy the scent.
B002PA8GUY|5|We gave this to my wife for Mother's day - from the kids - and she has enjoyed it very much. The basket was repurposed for hand towels in a guest room and the supplies decorate the bathtub when not in use.
B000052Y25|4|I have a lot of allergies and cannot use fragranced products.  This does have a slight citrus scent, which is very subtle, but nice.  You MUST leave the conditioner in your hair for a few minutes to have it work.  I used to slather it on and rinse it off, but would have a ton of tangles in my fine hair.  Now I put it in, twist it up on top of my head, wash, and then rinse it out.  Works great and no one knows it is a basic (not professional) conditioner.  I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it to anyone with sensitivities.
B001K1HVX2|5|I only had to use for 3 nights before my spot went away. Worked great for me!
B000EPZUCY|5|I'm 22 years old and birth control has KILLED my libido. I know this is for menopausal women but let me just tell you...I will NEVER be without this product again! Most women take a month or two for this to start working but oddly, to my surprise, the first night I took these my body responded to my fiances advances. I hadn't had that happen in 2 years. Now it's day 4 and let's just say 4 times now my body has responded the way it is suppose to ;)
B009NK508A|4|Nice shampoo and conditioner. I had a sample from a spa in Nevada and searched to find the product on line. The shampoo is really nice and moisturizing within being heavy, I have thin hair and the conditioner does not seem to weigh it down, but I use it sparingly.
B00DC908GC|5|smells great
B004TSFBNK|5|nice!
B003U8ESI4|4|It's an excellent Trimmer, Photos are same as the original, made of high quality material from china (I think it has been assembled only their), It has so many advantages like:<br />* Light in weight,Trimming Fast, rapid Charge, easy to adjust the comb, 99 % vacuuming the trimmed hair, clear display,accurate, cord and cordless.<br /><br />* But the only dis-advantage is that the charges goes down rapidly, that's why generally the general rate is 4 Stars.<br />* Also the Pouch is not included.<br /><br />Regards'<br />Ali Makki
B00S33CD5G|5|Fantastic Lip Balm!
B008LE3SEM|2|I was very disappointed in the Suavecito Shaving Creme. Although listed as \\"No brush needed,\\" I expected it to have at least a little lathering ability. Sadly, it had none. Just a runny rather watery consistency when it was applied. But the kicker was the scent. It smells like Vicks VapoRub. Fine scent if you have a cold and can't smell, but not very pleasant at all for a shave. This one is getting returned.
B00GMPYI8M|5|Love all the different sizes of the flexi-rods. They range from large, 1 inch rods to really small ones, maybe 1/4 of an inch or smaller. The bend is also really good. I've been using these for twist outs and sets and really like the look that using different colored rods gives. I have armpit length relaxed hair and my results are perfect every time! Great value.
B0072CTCIK|4|I loved the quality of the soap. It lasts a long time and is wonderful on the skin.  I anticipate trying other fragrances.
B00N6YEI6O|4|Full color coverage, very mildly drying, long-lasting.  This lipstick is satin to matte but blots completely matte.  I like to blot my lipstick to prevent it getting to my teeth and feathering.  It applies very smoothly.  I took off one star for being mildly drying and the darker than expected color.
B00KCTER3U|4|It's the only moisturizer I can get my husband to use.
B006ZN1B1S|5|I use this on damp hair, after shampooing/conditioner & I've gotta say that it really makes my hair look and feel thicker! I ran out a while back, and I thought &#34;something is missing&#34;...it was not using Diamax. If you have fine, thinning hair & need to give it a boost-this is a must!
B0057QW0MS|5|I really like this...gave me a whole different look..was very pleased, and will buy again! I have several headbands to go with it, and it is perfect!
B00TNK6548|5|Very nice color.
B00GYUHBOS|3|Does not fit Andis BGRV. even though it was recommended to purchase alongside.<br />Unsure how to return or exchange item
B002HEW7V2|4|Definitely one of the better tanning lotions I have used. Great color and goes on smoothly without feeling sticky. The only downside was an unappealing smell after tanning. I would purchase this again and recommend to others.
B00JEPBLZ0|1|I have the regular Sensationail gel kit, which works really well.  This one does not.  I did my nails about 3 hours ago.  Already, 3 have come off.  I followed the directions, which are simple.  This simply does not work.  I would recommend taking the time and money for the regular Sensaitonail gel manicure.
B001MA0QY2|1|Purchased in April 2013 and stopped working September 7, 2013.<br />It worked intermediately this last month.  The flatiron would work if the electrical cord was turned a certain way.  Then September 7,  the flatiron starting to put off an electrical smell.
B002WJOOIQ|1|I purchased this product about a week ago and when it arrived, the seal had already been cut (very cleanly I might add). I used the lotion anyway and it was definitely not the real stuff. I believe it was transplanted with something cheap and watered down. Avoid buying from Green Web Inc.
B004W1GRKK|5|Excelente!!
B008RODQFM|5|Purely amazing!
B0045WBFAI|5|I've used other oil treatments and have found that they get greasy or shiny (in a bad way) looking by the end of the day. This product is very light on the hair and takes away all frizz with just a couple of sprays. I have very long hair, but as long as I treat the top and midsection then comb it down, it works its way all the way down to the roots. My hair is light but shiny and healthy looking. People complimented me on the first time I used it, and I only used three sprays of it because I was scared that it would look oily.  I highly recommend it to anyone with a little frizz or even want healthy shine to their!
B006L6A7ZU|4|Great and makes my hair softer​ than it usually is.
B0099CS66U|5|I hate foundation. It either looks cakey or it's too sheer or the finish just looks fake. I can never wait to take it off when I get home. I've never found a BB cream I've liked, mostly because they're thick but also because I haven't had good luck finding an appropriate color for my skin: light-medium with yellow AND pink undertones. Which, admittedly, is no easy task. Also, I have really oily skin and just about everything oxidizes on me and looks really bad after about 6 hours. Enter Embryolisse BB Cream. I tried this because I like the 24-hour cream a lot, and the reviews of this were convincing enough. And they're not wrong. This stuff is awesome. Normally I don't like a matte finish because I think it just makes me look older. And normally I don't like silicone-based makeup because it feels like a gross mask. This doesn't do either of those things. Like the other reviews say, the coverage probably isn't enough to cover blemishes, but it is perfect if you just want to even out your complexion. It's just very natural looking. It doesn't oxidize on me, and I only have the slightest bit of shine after 10-12 hours, though I sometimes use that HD powder from Make Up For Ever on my T-zone. I haven't had any problems with clogged pores or breakouts. As for application, I've really only used this with a foundation brush. I tried it with the Beautyblender once, but it just seemed to take longer without any noticeable benefit. Because of my experience with all other face makeup, I was apprehensive about the color, particularly because there's only one and I figured the chances of it being a good color on me were slim to none. But no problem there either. Again, it's very natural looking. This is one of those products that I'll buy two at a time so I'll have one at home and one I can keep in my bag.
B007JLUL1G|5|This brand of Jojoba oil has a very positive difference from the mass produced products that you find in regular stores.
B00F2H3J0E|3|Very transparent
B000U1W3YK|5|I am a hair dresser and I been using this product on myself and my clients since 2011 I just wish I could find a distributor in Atlanta who sells it it does grow your hair out it takes about one month to start showing results but they r very satisfying results
B00ESZ0AJE|3|These are not any better than the ones you can buy at your local drugstore for $1.59. Don't bother. I was not given a free pair like the other reviewers. This is an actual product review! Not worth the $ IMO.
B0007V6PK6|4|This is a great product to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy.  It is a bit pricey though and I found that cocoa butter lotion works just as well.
B001G7PMV8|1|I shave my face and head a few times a week, and these were absolutely awful. Dull, dull, dull.  More nicks and scrapes than I can remember.  I swore I'd had these before and they were acceptable, but I guess not.  I'm sticking with 3 blades.
B00095W7D4|4|I love how tight it makes my skin feel.  I follow up with skinceuticals moisturizer! Not oily it dry at all
B00AMLHK00|5|just what i needed.
B005WLLGEQ|5|Fast shipping. This is the real deal.
B0089GCK96|5|thanks a lot
B000052YJX|1|Left my entire chin red, itchy, swollen, splotchy, and sore after only two applications. I will never use or recommend yoir products again!
B00EI23XH8|1|Recieved a fake product. Buyer beware.
B00NY5NGPE|5|Works amazing!
B0056BPR3I|1|The bristles are too short.  I have medium length hair.  This brush causes my hair to snap/break.  Seller is unresponsive.  Do yourselves a favor and find a brush shipped from amazon only.
B00ICO345O|5|The smell is great and this stuff is very strong!  Bought it for my husband and he uses it everyday throughout the day in his moustache and goat.  Will be ordering more in the future.  Fast shipping and great customer service!
B001ET7HAM|5|Arrived as expected.  Good product.  High fluoride content and helps with sensitivity.
B00K06FC0C|1|Would not work at all. Don't waste your money.
B00CB83EYI|3|Once applied, this item wore off very quickly. It is an interesting design, and it was relatively easy to apply although there are a few delicate edges.
B0037HP9OA|5|VERY NICE GROOMER SHIPPED QUICKLY BY SELLER.
B001E5E26I|5|I am so loving this!!! I don't use hairspray, mostly because I hated how it never held my style. I live in a city where it gets very windy so yeah keeping an updo style or nice hair is nearly impossible. But this holds my do!! I've used it with wet hair and/or dry and it always gives me great results. Seriously recomend this! I got this product as a free sample but non the less I thought I should share what I thought of it simply because I love it!!
B004R5E12M|5|I absolutely love it. I love all BB Cream really but this works so well. I love the way it makes my face look. I'm hispanic and my skin tone isn't fair but nor is it dark, yet this doesn't change the color or anything. It just evens everything out and makes it seem very smooth and flawless.
B00ZPQB9RW|5|This product is amazing, love it. I have sensitive skin and this product does not make my skin react.  I use this product on my hands, arms and legs after a shower as a skin moisturizer.  It keeps my skin moisturized, my tattoos look awesome and gives my skin a natural healthy glow.  No more dry flaky skin. I also use a couple of drops and work it through my daughters naturally curly hair, it eliminates frizz, keeps her curls under control and gives her hair a beautiful healthy shine.  My husband uses a drop or two worked through his beard to keep it under control and makes it look so healthy and feel so soft. This product is great for the whole family, it replaces many different products I have tried in the past.  A little goes a very long way,
B00RT3QZFK|5|Wow!  Customer Service is TOP notch!  I was initially disappointed with my purchase with all the rave reviews.  Then I received my mask with a heavy chemical smell.  I attempted to wash it and then soak it.  Don't soak or place it in the washing machine.  The satin silky finish faded and it was functional but fell apart and I was left with a beaten up product.  A few days later, they must have saw my review and I wasn't complaining for a refund or anything.  They promptly sent another replacement mask and this one has no chemical smell!  Maybe they suggested wherever Amazon stored it picked up something, but its wrapped in plastic so I'm not sure how that would work.  Anyhow I can't be more pleased with this type of CS!  I would buy this mask any time knowing that they truly want to see customers become raving fans of this mask.<br /><br />I just came back from a trip and my family couldn't believe I slept through the noisy neighbors as most times I complain when I wake up.  I never felt more rested now that I've been using the mask and ear plugs.  Most nights I would wake up and toss and turn until morning never getting a full rest.  Now, armed with THE BEST MASK EVER, and my heros ear plugs I sleep soundly.  Arthur Mall truly stands behind their products.  I wished they'd do a premium and put heros ear plugs as that would be an awesome package!
B000JN6FVG|4|Good sturdy chair. Only problem is the foot rests that are spaced very far apart. Wish the footrests could be adjusted.
B000063XHQ|5|I am the kind of guy who researches a lot before buying anything, and since I needed a trimmer for the first time, started reading up some reviews. This one had the absolute best reviews, and the price was great too! Bought this after reading up reviews for a week(Dont want to bloody up my nose after all!) and its a really good product. Cuts the hair close, doesnt cut anything else:d..The nose feels raw after using this, which I guess means its doing a good job of cutting the hair. You need to clean up your nose after a trim(the cut hair tends to stick inside) but thats a minor irritant. Does its job well, and for the price, its a great product! Looks like I need to get a Panasonic Shaver too now.
B001KYQ21Q|5|Phenomenal!  OMG, I have fine curly hair, and this is amaze balls. Best curls of my life. Honestly. I've tried all the standards --Loreal Curl, DevaCurl, Kinky Curly, Curls, but I will never look back. I'm hooked on Miss Jessie's for good. My curls are soft, bouncy, full, and gorgeous! And I love the scent.
B001KVXXOI|5|This product is an easy solution for cleaning your face.  I've used them for quite a while.  I like the 10 pkg as it is cheaper than the individual packets (which I have purchased and used).  The packaging keeps the towelettes moist until the towels are gone.  The cleanser doesn't \\"clash\\" with any of my moisturizers or other makeup.
B009JW64KU|5|this worked great I use it on my legs all the time and it looks fantastic like a real tan and it lasts a very long
B00OP23WR2|4|I like this hairspray because it's fairly light, but after a night of dancing at a wedding, it did get pretty sticky. On a regular day, though, it's great.
B0009DT39W|2|It takes forever to heat up and the batteries don't last long.  I guess that is because it takes<br />so long to heat up each time.  I would not recommend it.
B002Z13TKU|5|love it
B001CSZTFK|4|Works just like it is supposed too!
B002TS3JB8|5|I got what I ordered abnd got it before Christmas.  The product is as it was described.  My daughter loves it...so do her sisters.  They each want one too.  So do I!!!  MAy have to order more.
B0084SHAGC|5|Fits, face perfectly.  there is a wide version of this mask but it gets sweaty during the night, this one is just the right size
B0062BE1NI|5|Holds my angel fine hair in place, now that is a feat!<br /><br />And it smells, truly and totally luscious, as described in Lucky Magazine!
B00MYRTF4E|4|I bought this mirror to replace a similar fluorescent one made by Conair, because the Conair mirror did not swivel. This mirror puts out a good amount of light compared to others I tried. The 10x side is amazing; I can see every tiny flaw without the need for glasses, and is very useful for putting on eye makeup and tweezing brows. My only criticism, and this is true of all 10x mirrors, is that you need to lean in very close to it; otherwise you will get a lot of distortion. When you want to step back and see your entire face without distortion, just flip the mirror over and use the 1x side.<br /><br />I'd also like to add a word about fluorescent bulbs. The light can be a little harsh, but if you really want to see fine details, it works very well. The incandescent bulbs used in other makeup mirrors can be flattering, but don't you want to see what you really look like when you go outside in bright sunlight or when you go to work at an office with fluorescent lighting?
B0084KMRJ0|5|Love this stuff!  It truly diminishes the little fine lines around the eyes .  It also seems to brighen up my entire face.  I only use it at night before I go to bed.  But be careful with your pillow case because it will turn it a little yellow/orange.  But it's totally worth it1
B000L1FOC2|5|It smells soooo good.  I love this perfume,  Definitely a classic must have.
B00IINPW5O|2|I know they where cheap but not that cheap. None of the drip tips would stay on the bottles as soon as you take the cap off the dropper comes with it. And is difficult to get them to separate after that. I was going to use them for e-liquid and I don't think any one wants to go digging through nicotine juice to retrieve the dropper. I can not use these for my customers. Luckily the vendor issued a full refund but I needed these when they finally arrived and now I have to reorder from another company and be with out for a week till then. 50 bottles times $8 is $400 bucks I'm missing out on till I get the other shipment in.
B0077LAJT2|5|These have become my favorite everyday shaving blades, they are sharp yet smooth and provide a comfortable, close shave consistently.
B00B8P5CTA|4|This brush set is the first one that I've gotten, and I'm in love. They came in a very timely manner and all of the brushes came individually wrapped and very neat inside the case. The smell that I read about in previous reviews is just the scent of the case, and it isn't too bad. The only concern that I have is the shedding on the large fan brush, but I'd definitely recommend this set.
B00IXX8YMM|1|Worst product I have ever used on my hair.  Left it gummy and sticky.  Threw it out!
B0014AUWG2|5|This soap smells great and doesn't dry out my skin.
B00KYN8ON8|1|It broke the second time I used it.  The plastic holding the roller snapped because it was not able to roll properly.  It kept getting stuck. Waste of money.  Don't buy it from this company!
B00BS123AK|5|Can notice a difference after 30 days!
B0006ZM4LC|5|The Braun 370 shaver is beautifully designed and made. It's quieter and more sturdy than the 400 series I'm replacing it with. Even the sideburn-beard trimmer works better.  I can't think of anything that could be improved.
B007UOG3OG|5|I really like this after shave, because it smells really good and it makes my face feel a lot better after shaving.
B009K6LFEU|4|Great blades at a fair price.
B004TO8MO4|3|I needed this after minor face surgery. I was OK, not the best but it did the job for the minimal time I needed it.
B004OHQR1Q|5|I got these two weeks before the estimated delivery! They are perfect. People are complaining about the tips but you can clearly see in the picture that all the ends are the same on one side. I got five different ones no doubles. The price was great and coming from China I got them very fast.
B00LS8G6J2|5|This brush was well worth the money.  What a great deal for a fine, strong and soft makeup brush.  I'm new at professional brush and makeup use and this brush has helped me apply makeup cleaner and faster.  Highly recommend it!  Thanks to Neweights and Amazon for an excellent transaction.
B001ILTV1Y|5|I like the shade and stayed on well
B0057RIM5G|4|i love this idea every one wants to know where i got the<br />love it  love love love this happy
B00IGGTW5O|5|My son has had very dry skin from the time he was born. It was diagnosed as eczema. It itches and he would scratch until it bleeds and bruises. We tried many different natural moisturizers and oils but nothing helped so I decided to not punish him with my prejudice I decided to try other options. We tried lubriderm, cetaphil and aquaphor. Of those three aquaphor worked best but it was nothing close to how much better his skin got with Mary Anns moisturizer. He loves it because it helps with the itching. It is organic so I don't even have to worry about any long term effects. Thanks for the great product.
B0015KHMRS|5|This is an awesome set and works great I use it weekly on one person or another
B004UOTVG6|5|Lived up to my expectations---------yeah---
B003JLX4AU|4|I love it very light and full it looks like humam hair I need a second one just in case they discontinue
B00ET3TCKS|1|I ordered this item based on the picture, but when it finally arrived I was very unhappy. It was one solid color, completely opposite from the Description and pictures.
B002GZVUJM|5|This is one of the best colognes I've ever worn.  It smells different than most products out there, last long, and will get you compliments wherever you go.  Great product.
B008N3GTDS|4|Good quality for the price, not as nice as some of the other no name brands. I typically get two weeks out of a razor, these I get one...but still worth the price!!
B0037HP9OA|4|Does what it says it will do and well. Would give 5 stars, but the battery doesn't seem to stay strong long enough, but then maybe it isn't made for daily use as I use it.
B00JPH5YUU|3|I bought this overnight bag for my smaller suitcase. It is attractive and has enough room for all my toiletries. My only negative would be the clip closure. It is hard to find a rod that it will hang from as the clip opening is small.
B004CG0XIW|5|I gave this rating a 5 star because it smells really nice and well worth the price. I would but this again
B003Y7EU16|5|Great product.  Non irritating.  Helps diminish wrinkles and keeps them from coming back!  Have been using this product for 5 years and I hope I can always get it!
B0013N5XAU|5|It is hard for me to find an eyeshadow color that suits me.  This is it.  I use just a dab of the darker color under my lower lashes, and it emphasizes my eyes while looking almost like a natural shadow, which is just what I want.
B007XIW8MK|3|I have heard great things about the Mizani hair products so I purchased it, however I have not used it yet.
B0017JBQEC|5|Love Tan Towels.  As I am 59, I do not enjoy spending hours and hours in the sun as when I was young.  People cannot believe that this is a &#34;fake&#34; tan.  Looks very natural.  I had bought this item before in a store and loved it.
B0007CXX82|2|I agree with a previously written review.  I have never used the product before but I was disappointed when I tried to pour a little in my hand.  It is the 5.64 ounce and poured like water!  I won't try to return it because of the previous reviewers experience.  I would like to try the smaller size to compare but it is not Amazon Prime and I don't want to pay the outrageous shipping price. I think there should be a 'comparison' study. If the smaller bottle has a thicker consistency, an explanation is definitely needed!
B001E5E222|5|I have naturally curly (read unruly) hair and this is the BEST product hands down. A little goes a long way and tames my frizz as well as defines my curls. I love this product!
B009GGTKC8|5|Love this product!
B00BOJC4XW|1|I received this and it was completely empty/dried out and cannot return. Don't order this!!
B005BEF5EQ|5|really helps your hair dry faster... Kenra products are always solid in my opinion
B00247ZOP8|5|Great product!
B00021B1KK|5|Great shine and does make lips fuller!!! It is really adddicting. It tingles a little, but I almost enjoy it.
B001022W3U|5|British Sterling has always been my favorite scent for many years. The deo stick is hard to find outside of the holiday season. This stick goes on super smoothly, leaves no residue and really works well. Glad to have found it.
B002WTCK4Q|1|Great idea, but I was in so much pain, I couldn't sleep. I followed the directions and it took about 20 minutes before my jaw hurt so much I took the guard out and decided to &#34;return&#34; it. I would not suggest this product.
B003EMJHG4|5|I do foot patrols of parking lots in 100+ degree weather. The last time I checked the asphalt temperature it was 140 degrees F. So there's my point of reference for this product.<br /><br />I don't sweat excessively and I still smell fresh after an 8 hour shift. Most deodorants and antiperspirants couldn't do that for me. I have sensitive skin and it hasn't given me a problem.
B001T0HHDI|5|My daughter and I both love how fast it heats up and curls so beautifully.  The curls last for days also with just a little touch up. I love the cool tip for easy handling.  No problems with the purple coating so far. . love it!
B000E7WFUM|5|I was so happy to be able to find the .5 oz. size of  Knowing.<br />It arrived in rapid time and I was completely satisfied.
B00PSKTVO8|3|Removes hair, but NOT permanently. Just another razor.
B004WLN4U6|5|Haven't used this yet but I love Clinique and of their other products.  I am sure I will love this as well.
B005G9EAH4|4|The color is great but with the mechanical pencil, you don't realize how quickly you'll run out of it.
B0020MMGL2|5|This is the classic scent! I ordered this for my grandson and it was a big hit for Christmas. This is his favorite, and he is very picky.
B00IT06ZIY|4|The scent is a little less than desired, but the soap foams well.
B00CHOX0ZO|5|Very Good!!!
B00BB3K1WC|3|It's does not work like I expected makes my hair look grease.
B00408QTOY|5|Best stuff ever!
B005797LP6|2|Ok
B00103URIQ|3|There's some things for which this thing is amazing: removing lint, removing those little \\"pills\\" and lasting forever on two AA batteries.  This definitely gets the bigger pills off a sweater.      HOWEVER, this does not remove sweater \\"fuzz,\\" especially you are trying to get fuzz off acrylic sweaters (which is annoying since it cuts close enough to tear holes in your stuff, but not close enough to cut off fuzz).  The only way to really remove the fuzz is to literally shave the sweater w/ a razor.   I use my 3blade bic and it works great.  You'll feel ridiculous; you'll make a mess and you'll spend 30 min. doing it, but your sweater will look \\"new\\" or as close to it as you can hope.  Still, it's cheaper than getting new gear every few years.    This isn't worthless.  It's great in the morning when you just need to get some little pills off your clothes before you go to work, but it definitely doesn't make anything look \\"brand new.\\"  It's cheap and worth buying for what it does, but a lot of reviews are kind of misrepresenting what to expect.
B00520BVT2|1|The wig does not look like the picture.  Does not look natural.  Totally dissapointed.  I will not recommend the wig.
B0073XQP6K|5|Great product for overworked color treated hair!! The fragrance could be better... It works  and that makes it worth the money... I have a drawer full of overpriced products that don't do what they claim....  I actually received a sample of this and liked it so much I bought it..
B000OD5V8E|2|I have the Marc Jacobs Gardenia, which I love, but this perfume gives me headaches. I hadn't smelled it before ordering, but just based it on others reviews.  From the couple times that I have tried it, I had to remove it shortly after putting it on, and still, it seems to last a very long time. I certainly would recommend that you smell it before ordering. Perfumes don't normally give me headaches but for some reason this one does.. Smells very pretty, but also very floraly, so if you are a floral person then maybe this is the one for you (I don't normally like strong floral scents, I think this one was just too strong for me).  Pretty otherwise.
B0023A7JF4|4|I love this soap. This soap is the best when it comes to moisturizing your skin. I can really see a difference in the tone and texture of my skin.<br />The only bad thing about this soap is it stains your washcloths..Other than that it's a pretty good soap. The smell isn't bad and you feel extra clean after washing with it...I don't use this soap on sensitive areas as my face.. But it's a great soap! I would defiantly recommend this soap to others.
B009YA758M|4|This butter is very nice
B00QLZAZT4|3|Ordered two and when I reserved my package after a long wait they were different sizes. Don't know why. At least they are sharp. Seems like good quality.
B001AYTNVC|5|THE Closest thing I've found to Aveda Self Control yet. Excellent non greasy or sticky control for my short hair!
B002KAOAYA|5|Keeps dry mouth moist and smooth. I no longer need to worry about the health of my teeth from dry mouth.
B000N5WT2O|5|Love it
B0036BI56G|5|You can't beat this product!  I was using much more expensive Vitamin C serums until I found this one after some research.  I'm glad I found it.  It works great - gives my skin a nice, healthy glow and helps keep it smooth.
B00CEQJV62|5|Very good shampoo!
B003V57Q5I|5|Hands down the best oil-absorbing sheets I've ever used. I've been using this since high school and over the years I tried other brands and other types of blotting sheets but still go back to this one. I just need one sheet. It doesn't absorb water, just oil. I keep one in almost every purse. I highly recommend this.
B00005O0MZ|5|I chose this because it was top ranked as been considered good quality with low price. And I bought this at a relatively low price, and so far it is easy to use and works well.
B0017KGC7C|4|Very similar to a MAC blush that I love, only so much cheaper!! I love it, the color is really great and it is really easy to build the color. The only reason I gave it only 4 stars was that the plastic case came cracked.
B00MQBDZVM|4|I wore these per instructions.  Forgot about my feet but days later they began to peel and peel.  Skin where it peeled was smooth.  However, it did not remove callouses.
B003S54I02|5|Once my husband finally got into the anti-theft packaging, he's very happy with this to replace a scratch screen on his Remington shaver.
B003D7L7OK|5|The Only deodorant my husband can use, all others give him a rash....I do not know what it is about this one in this scent but he has used other scents and they caused a rash too so maybe this one is just super hypo allergenic?
B00H43066Y|5|I'm always looking for new products that are going to give me beautiful, glowing skin. Sometimes it feels like all the creams and cleansers and lotions and potions are overwhelming, though. I'd like to strip my skin clean and bare of all those chemicals and treatments and just let it breathe.<br /><br />The Exfolimate seems kind of perfect for that. There are no creams or scrubs needed, just pure water and this tool.<br /><br />I found the Exfolimate extremely simple to use. The two-piece set comes with one tool for your body and a smaller tool for your face. You can us them in the bath or shower, once your skin is supple with moisture. Then you hold it at a 90-degree angle and run the stainless steel edge along your skin. The edges aren't sharp and the sensation is kind of soothing and pleasant. I could definitely see little bits of dead skin etc being flaked off as I used the tool. It's a lot less harsh than scrubbing and I think it's made a difference in the overall health and appearance of my skin.<br /><br />Why is exfoliation so important, you might wonder. Aside from giving your skin an overall smoother and more youthful appearance, it helps with your other beauty endeavors. From making an even surface for your spray tan to adhere to, to making sure your makeup goes on smoothly, to clearing the way for shaving and waxing and even making sure your feet are perfectly pedicured- it's a pretty important step in your daily routine. I think this is well worth the money and investment of time.
B002HEW8QQ|5|thanks
B006RFZ66K|5|I have used this product off and on for several years and find it to be a good one for me. It keeps those nasty blackheads at bay. Like some of the other reviewers have said, it is interesting to look at those little white sticks that show up when you pull the strip off. Those are 'baby blackheads' just waiting to turn black, I think. These pore strips are getting the job done for me and I do recommend them for people with this type of problems.
B0006ZHJM6|5|This product works very well for people who have fine fly away hair, it really keeps it in place with body.
B001VEK1LW|5|Brought new life to rasor.
B001GGL4Q6|4|The product was perfect, came quickly, but it was a bit pricey.  I was will to pay the price because I love the product and it is discontinued.  So very happy to find it.
B001JH0I8M|3|my hair comes out super clean and i love the scent - very exotic!  easy to use, easy to pack along when you travel.    it does take some getting used to - it won't lather up as much as shampoos with sulfates.    it may strip too much moisture from some hair, so if your hair tends to be dry, you may need some kind of heavy-duty conditioner.
B00I4ZTGIA|5|This trolley is ideal for moving around in the salon and the price is fabulous would definitely buy<br />A couple more.
B0009MFUPO|5|Renewed my shaving experience back to close and comfortable.  I hadn't noticed that my old heads had dulled after years of use.
B004DIXYUI|5|This powder is fantastic!!! It really is! This thing makes such a difference you will  find yourself wondering why you did not know about it earlier. I am !
B00FAEOCP0|5|I've searched high and low for a great mascara and finally found it!  During the day, I'll apply a couple coats and have a nice professional look but for a night out, a few more and my lashes stand out like they should.
B00BRG4G7E|5|Recently switched to a replaceable blade old fashion safety razor and got both this shave oil and a brush lather. This oil is so easy to use and smells great after I'm done. Conditions my skin and gives the closest shave I've ever had in my life.
B00BOJSVUC|1|Was not satisfied with this scent of the cologne
B000WZCA6U|5|This is the best eye makeup remover. I have been using it for years due to it's effectiveness in removing even the waterproof mascara. I have a very sensitive skin and this product is amazing!
B00BJUTIJO|1|I have bought this brand for 3 years , it used to be the BEST !!! About a year ago something changed and it is NOT the same product quality ... It will be a HUGE ball of matted mess after about a week ... I dont mind spending the $ for quality but this is no longer it . I have read over reviews on different sites and this seems to be the case for them too. What the heck happened ??? So disappointed !
B004OHQR1Q|5|THIS WAS PERFECT.  IT CAME ON TIME AND IT WORKS.  THIS IS A GREAT GIFT IDEA OR SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF.
B004Z209HS|5|I wish I could take a bath in this stuff it is so good.  Great for skin, hair, nails, feet and lips.  I apply it to my face in the morning and it soaks right in.  Also great packaging with a pump but can also be transferred to smaller bottles.  I will definitely order more.
B00HH07ZEU|5|good and cheap, arrived here so quickly
B00PFCS7XK|4|very nice, easy to apply, dryes fast and doesn't create  wrinkle marks under my eyes
B00JJ1J2J6|5|Exactly as expected! Thank you.
B002PQ8BQM|5|This works well for me.  It actually works as advertised for me.  I am sure body chemistry is different for everyone, but for me this is like a miracle.
B000C1VVQO|1|Horrible perfume. I am not sure whether this was a genuine Davidoff one. I am sure this is a an imitation version. Amazon should stop selling this kind of cheap imitation and warn consumers against potential fraud.
B003V5KWWM|5|I use this every day when in the sun
B0017KG7TK|5|The colors are just as pictured. I really love this brand. It is great for sensitive skin. I would purchase again.
B00IJQDZTU|5|I like this product
B00KGC67SQ|5|Very refreshing lavender spray
B004NJS3J4|5|Love these little soaps.  The big ones are just too big and these are just the perfect size.  They last forever too.
B0080EEMCA|5|Great moisturizer. You get a lot of product for the low price. The scent is very lovely and fresh. Heals and soothes burns as well!
B00NNLWIY4|5|Great product
B0022WIO8O|5|Loved this.
B001BQZFJ8|5|Great!!!!!!
B001FWXMOS|5|I ordered this for my daughter in law's birthday, it was the right price, and delievered on time, and she loved it!
B002UUT38I|5|I'm a natural girl and don't want to fuss too much with my appearance.  With that said I needed a little help with my pores now that I am aging.  This cleanser is gentle and designed to use everyday, although I plan to use it just twice a week.  My complexion looks more radiant after I use it.  My makeup also goes on smoother.  I would recommend it as a first step to fight off the signs of aging.
B00D5UMQOK|3|The face printing wore off after 1 day.
B002SAZO7Y|3|not a great deal for hair fall , but maybe some what act a little bit with other stuff to prevent hair fall ,
B000GI0RY0|5|I get a lot of wonderful compliments when I wear this perfume, a good friend bought it for me a couple of years ago and I am able to still get it sometimes at a discount.
B00FZKB51S|4|I love the flat top brushes. They work really really well with liquid foundations. I use the bigger flat top kabuki one to stipple on foundation. The little one works good for blush.
B0081MQ47C|4|This toothbrush is great.It brushes for two min and stops.my dentist asked me how my teeth was so clean,very little attar.took a four day trip,lef my charger at home.toothbrush worked fine.
B00QXEFYTE|5|As described. Perfect to get areas on back that you can't reach with hands.
B00A2F1MBO|5|Amazing pristine quality. I actually used it to prepare an insecticidal soap solution mixed with coldpressed neem oil for my organic garden. Very high quality all natural soap!
B004AX4XVA|5|beautiful sent - just like spring
B00U4FQFZ0|5|Really love the scent and the feel of my skin after I used it. Great product!<br /><br />I did get a discount to give an honest and unbiased review
B00092M2X2|5|I have very long, VERY thick hair, and usually it takes about an hour and half  to dry my hair, with a blow dryer. Well, with this dryer, it literlay takes under 20 minutes!!!! I was soooo surprised the first time I used it. Would 100% buy this item again. Best Christmas present EVER!
B004V5YNDK|5|Love the Gratiae products.  Superior product at a great price, recommend the scrub and the body butter be used together.  All the fragrances are awesome, just pick one!
B001330XFA|4|I work 2 jobs and go to school full time.  I'm usually pressed for time.  This thing actually saves me about 5 minutes per day.  Instead of towel drying my hair and slowly product combing it into place I get out of the shower, comb with the styler, and walk out the door.  I almost never use any product.  I'm betting most guys don't use a dryer, but my lady sure loves running her fingers through my hair.  I'm gonna chalk that up to having no crunchy gel or oily pomade.  Only negative is that the plastic on the comb attachment is a little cheap.  The fine tooth broken after being put back on the shelf a little carelessly.  The thicker comb seems to be holding up better.
B008T85MU8|5|The nail striping tape is not that much of a &#34;wow&#34; factor, but I definitely LOVE the dotting pens. Perfect size, you can choose and do a whole lot of designs, I even tried to do french nails with the dotting pens, and it worked perfect!
B0098QQ88U|5|Love this conditioner. Was recommended by my stylist as the best detangler
B00IIE0ADW|5|Cute.  Larger than I thought.  It is a little hard to open.  It is made of silicone and flexible.
B006DR2DI6|5|Officially a lover of Schick. This product gives me the ultimate shave in all my 2000 parts :). Will always buy this.
B0003009NK|5|You can really tell a difference between this straightener and the cheaper brands. It heats up quickly and I can straighten my hair in half the time is used to take me.
B007GM30PC|5|These are fantastic products. They provide perfect coverage but it doesn't even look like you're wearing anything. The cream blends in really well and it is amazing that it can work with a variety of skin tones. After using for awhile you will notice a difference in your skin. I use this and I have aging skin. My daughter is a teenager and she uses it. It helps with dark spots, acne, dryness...our skin looks great.
B003YCCLXK|5|Bought it as a present for my mom and she absolutely loved it! She says it smells great and uses it everyday.
B004GEXU5S|4|I don't have any reaction to the products.  It's only been a 1 week of use. So far so good.  No new acne break out.
B00POI3INE|5|A Thousand wishes smell so good I put some on my chest area my boyfriend wouldn't move for nothing he kept laying on me he love the scent of this lotion one of my favorite from bath and body works love it
B000WZR92K|5|I always get compliments when I wear this scent.  I've been wearing it for 5 years now and it never gets old.
B000R1RKVY|4|Never let me down, this is one of the mascara I always use.
B00SS8PI26|4|This shampoo smells very nice and a little goes a long way (which is  good b/c this bottle is pretty small),  it lathers and rinses well. I used it with no conditioner, but did use the complementing Dove Advanced Hair Series Styling Cream when drying my hair.  It did leave my hair feeling soft and smooth.  It gave me more volume and less &#34;crunch&#34; and frizz.  Overall, this works well.
B00CFNVWRA|4|This eye cream is nice. Goes on soft and smooth. Gives ur eyes a nice lift
B009JM212A|5|I mix a few drops of the Arthritis Comfort Essential Oil Blend with a moisturizing lotion and rub it on my knees when they are feeling achy at night.  It eases the discomfort and lets me fall asleep.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.
B001BZHYC0|5|Very pretty black sand and holds the heat for burning resin and incense a generous amount. Sift it to reuse.
B005TI2AAQ|5|Very soothing & relaxing
B000FS1W4U|5|I've had mine for almost all 4 years of college and it still works well.  It's lasted longer than a lot of friends in my life.  I've had no sparks, no overheating, and have not burned off any of my hair.  I use it to dry my hair after I take a shower and I have no complaints.
B00H3VQT40|5|As expected.  No issues.
B0000530ED|5|great, subtle, deep red color.  I've gotten a lot of compliments since switching to this shade.  Easy to apply and does not damage my hair.
B000PKKD4I|5|I work in cosmetics. I have tons of lip glosses and lipsticks but I've never truly loved until Guerlain KissKiss Gloss 824 found its way into my life. How will I ever live without it? The texture, the smell, the color. Perfection! Not a day goes by without a stranger complimenting me on my lip color. It looks amazing on top of lipstick and yet I can wear it alone for a hint of color and a glossy lip. Did I mention I love it?
B000NL0T1G|5|Love this razor!  My long search is over, I'll never buy another razor.
B008FP6KBU|5|Works well with nails and art
B009ZRFJGY|1|Awful
B00LZ5UTDW|5|One of the only 'Natural & Water Based' pomade products out there.  I use this everyday.  Even just as a base, I'm sold.  Can't wait till they drop a 'Firm or Super' hold!
B001JJ69RE|4|I was excited to get my free sample of crest pro-health toothpaste to review from crest and smiley360.  At first, it took me by surprise, with the crunching, but then I realized it's just like getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist.  It makes my mouth feel fresh for a long time.  much longer than the other brands.  Ever since I started using the Crest Pro-health toothpaste,  my mouth has felt fresher and less sensitive to cold and heat.  I've also noticed them getting whiter.  This toothpaste works great.
B0084HCIHY|4|I only have 1 complaint....when the product arrived the container was broken.....I just transferred it to another container, the product seems to be ok and not dried out.
B004L938P0|1|When I received this, it was barely half full!  Not happy!
B003E21OEM|5|I am a 43 year old woman so those fine little wrinkles around the lips have appeared.  I have tried numerous products to help stop my lipstick from feathering.  Finally, finally....I have found a product that works.  I literally threw away several items last night that didn't work.  My lipstick stays put for hours and even looked good after meals/cocktails.  This product is worth every penny!
B0007TG4IG|5|I've been eyeballing the Lush line for awhile - but hadn't given it a try till now. Before I had avoided it because of the very minimal chemicals still used in many of the recipes (when I was on a 100% natural everything kick)...<br /><br />After I'd shed that obsession - I decided to start trying other things, and out of convenience, I was using avalon organics (because I can buy it locally at the commissary, and its better than the super chem loaded stuff...) However.. it had been taking a toll on my hair. It was getting very dry and coarse feeling after just a week of using the avalon organics brand shampoos and conditioners...<br /><br />So - I started reading up again on Lush - it seems to have an either completely love or completely hate effect on people... but I wanted to give it a shot - and the bonus was that there's a mall nearby that sells it. (I'm in Japan, so getting the good stuff that works wonders with my hair involved quite a bit of mail order - and when i was experimenting to find what worked best.. it was a lot of hit or miss with brands).. the fun part with shopping locally for Lush was trying to figure out what was what (everything is written in japanese). The ladies who worked in the store were very very very awesome, helpful, good humored women, and between a newspaper they had of the products translated to english, broken sentenced communication, trials and demonstrations, and in general, a good amount of girlish giggling between all of us - I left the store with a nice bag of goodies!<br /><br />This hair conditioner was one of them... though I was a bit worried about if it would be good or bad for me (I'd read mixed reviews and many who didn't like the product line on a long hair community forum)..<br /><br />Incredibly long ramble condensed short.. my hair is amazingly silky and soft again!!!! I used the reincarnate solid shampoo in conjunction with this conditioner (also something I was worried about because previous shampoo bars left my hair feeling really gross and icky)... But this shampoo bar was awesome! It lathered rather well, and wasn't hard to work through my hair at all, and it rinsed out easily without any gross icky residue.<br /><br />So yeah - I highly recommend this conditioner - a great product, one of my new favorites (and I've tried quite a few of the all natural and mostly natural brands out there for comparisons...)gross and icky)... But this shampoo bar was awesome!

B00ONHX648|5|Love it
B00EXJKX1K|5|Great product! Arrived in good time and was new and nice
B0028PKWFS|4|have not try it yet,hope will have effects on:)  the only problem is it was broken when i received..
B0015TIFV6|5|My doctor told me I had to wear these for any type of travel. If you're looking for a close-toe anti-embolism stocking I would highly recommend these. The fit is perfect and they helped prevent any type of edema I would have had had I not worn them when I traveled.
B00NZR94VQ|3|Two were the same color and one of the duos were a terrible color/design...lime green with multi-color polka dots.  Shipped from China, took forever.
B001707IQ6|1|Pros:<br />Beautiful bottle<br /><br />Cons:<br />Burns eyes,  doesn't make it last all day,  spray leaves spots on makeup. I don't even have sensitive skin or eyes, but burned every single time I used it<br /><br />I really wanted to love this after all the reviews but I'll keep looking for something to keep my makeup on all day
B0095IMNI0|5|Just as expected
B008747EC8|2|These took exactly 1 month to receive. The color is nice (#2 Brown) it is slightly lighter than my own. They held up to the &#34;real hair&#34; test. Did not frey at the ends when straightened. However, I ordered 100g and what was shipped feels like 80g. They are thick up top and extremely thin at the bottom. These extensions would have to be dramatically cut in order to blend into my hair because they are so thin at the bottom. I ordered these to lengthen my hair not thicken and that's what these will serve, only. Maybe someone else will have better luck with them. My $50 wasn't well spent.
B0021MLVA8|5|A very classy man's fragrance. It does have a somewhat sweet smell, so better for the evenings attracting the ladies!
B00110DWCQ|1|I ended up returning the product before I even tried it because after a quick call to Murad I learned the tube I received had been expired since last year. No good at all. Just be wary if you purchase this from anywhere except Murad.
B001P32MEI|4|Arrived quickly and perfect condition. I tried this color instead of the usual 6R Mahogany that I usually buy and use. It's pretty but it covers lighter.
B004D04Q8U|3|I'm really disappointed by this product. My two big problems with this balm are that it is VERY shimmery compared to pictures and it smells strongly of banana. It's a good texture and moisturizes well, however, and these are both personal taste complaints, so I won't give a lower rating. (I purchased &#34;petal glow&#34; if this displays on other colors' pages too.)<br />I looked at color swatches, user pictures, and examples for hours before I bought this. I saw that it had shimmer in it, which I don't like, but in all the reviews and pictures I looked at it looked barely noticeable. The colors looked subtle but great. In person that is not the case. The shimmer is so pronounced that any benefit of the color is lost. I wanted something to make my lips look more dressed, a little bit of peach or pink in addition to the dewiness a balm gives. This is not that!! It makes my lips look lighter and smaller. It looks &#34;icy&#34; or &#34;frosted.&#34; I feel like an old lady or a twelve year old wearing it.<br />Also, unmentioned in anything is that the scent of this product is...banana?? Artificial candy banana &#34;Runts&#34; banana. I hate banana and this is really gross to me. The scent doesn't linger at least but it's very strong on application.<br />What I do like about this product is the way it feels on my lips. It feels like a good balm, maybe a little bit stiffer or dryer but not by much. If you like shimmer (or already have super smooth,full lips) and you like banana you'll probably like this product.<br />I wish I didn't spend as much on this product as I did. I don't think I'm going to use it.
B00247XQS0|5|I had seen someone use this on a youtube video to make scars, so I decided to give it a try for my upcoming Halloween look. I drew the line of the scar on with some lipliner and went over it with the rigid collodion. It took several (maybe 8 or 9) layers to get the look I wanted. Without using any other makeup, it looked pretty good. It does look shiny, though, so I would suggest some foundation or powder to use on top of it if you want to leave the scar plain. I was worried that it might be uncomfortable, but besides making the area where it is applied a little stiff, I didn't notice any discomfort. It smells really horrible, though, so be sure to use in a well ventilated area.
B000EBFJVK|4|This product is very good. I have always hated shaving my bikini area because of the painful bumps and ingrown hairs that would inevitably follow. Now, I use Tend Skin immediately after I shave, and no red bumps! I re-apply as I see ingrown hairs forming, and those are much less of a hassle now. I get occasional ingrown hairs on my legs and haven't seen as good of results there, but it works where I really need it to.
B0031NP5TO|5|Exactly whAt my curly hair needed.
B000A3XHY8|1|I never write reviews on Amazon, but I recently dyed my hair using this product. I ended up buying 2 more bottles of the exact same product from Sally Beauty Supply knowing that the one bottle I bought online would not be enough for my hair and that I could always go back and return what I didn't use. As soon as I received this product I noticed that the colors on the label were quite faded compared to the same product I bought from the store, but I didn't think anything of it. However, when I opened the bottle and poured the dye into my mixing bowl I knew something was wrong with it. It was slightly discolored and there were weird, small chunks in it. Despite my suspicions, I proceeded to mix it with developer, just to discover that it would not turn into a rich, red-violet color as it is supposed to. Intead, it remained a gross brown color. It also began to harden at the top and the strange chunks were still present. It became very clear that the dye was expired and completely unusable. I was afraid that the other two bottles of dye would not be enough for my long, thick hair and that I would not be able to dye my entire head of hair. Luckily I had enough, but I was still extremely disappointed that the dye I bought from this seller and the developer I mixed with it went to complete waste. The product itself is great; I ended up loving my hair color and the dye itself is a much higher quality than box dyes. However, DON'T buy it from this seller or you may end up receiving expired dye! If you want this product I would recommend going to a beauty store to guarantee that it won't be expired, or at least buying it from a different seller.
B005NM4SUI|5|Floral notes,not too heavy,but stays with me all day,I received a lot of compliments on this !! Bought the next  one I saw  (smaller) to go in my purse or travel bag, quickly,because my daughter tried to snag it lol !!!
B004B890SA|1|I had this item on auto-refill, and all of a sudden it's unavailable, after being a loyal customer for years and years
B008RP6GGC|5|I've looked at several diffusers and this one is the best priced for the money spent. I bought one for my daughter six months ago and we LOVE it. I'm now buying one for my sister and soon will buy one for me. Seriously, who wants to breathe candle wick smoke anyway? I just learned about the citrus issue (not recommended by the manufacturer) but I've mostly use citrus and so far have no issues, but I'll be sure to clean out the bowl after using citrus.
B00H0FD4V0|4|Beautiful quality.  I have very thick hair and these hold it in place very well.  I will order more of these.
B001E6UJXC|3|This stuff used to be amazing - really rich, with a great scent.  But in the last several months it seems different; smells like chemicals and artificial stuff, and not as emollient as before.  It's no longer worth the price.
B00FH692PQ|5|I ordered this because I had a lot of hair loss.  I was pleasantly surprised at the way that the shampoo and conditioner left my hair: with a lot of body. The body it gave to my hair helped it to look fuller - until my hair thickens again.<br /><br />The smell is light, as I do not like heavily perfumed shampoos.  I like the fact that I am not adding chemicals to my hair.
B0080CO2F4|5|This is gorgeous!  It arrived over a week EaRLY!<br /><br />I also bought the peacock bracelet and they match perfectly!<br /><br />I get many compliments on this!
B00O9HLQIU|5|I'm not sure if this thing works or not, but I love how quick shipping was.  I will post something after two weeks. I'm going to combine it with exercise and healthy diet.
B002YMZSH2|5|They were great.<br />Thank you
B00ACN2Q84|5|Gift for wife who says she has that &#34;dentist feel&#34; after brushing.  No complaints!
B003WR3QSG|1|Whenever I see a really bad review here or anywhere online I often wonder if the product is really that bad or if the reviewer is just someone who is never pleased with ANYTHING. Well; I have purchased dozens of things online over the years and, as far as I remember, this is the only item that I have ever returned. When attempting to shave with this brush many hairs fell out with each use, but most importantly, it smells horribly!!! I can't even tell you what the smell is, but it is putrid. Having never owned a shaving brush before, I thought that perhaps the smell was normal for a new brush and would go away, but after talking with friends that shave with a badger brush they assured me that they had never noticed any smell in their own brushes. In short; the manufacturer of this item should be ashamed, and the retailer should fire their buyer who placed the purchase order. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM
B00373DIYM|5|Loved it!
B00X6P92OG|4|First  of  all  let  me  tell  you that  this  product  is paraben, sulfate, mineral  oil, and lanolin  free. It can  be  applied  all  over  your  body  as well  as worn like  foundation  or under your  makeup. This sunscreen  has a brownish  tint to it and it blends  with  ease. I do wish  it was a little  darker. The consistency  is creamy  but not oily. I wish  the scent  was a bit stronger. I find  this  product  to  be  really  moisturizing. I received  this  product  for  free  in  exchange  for  an  honest  review.
B000NHZSKC|5|It's one of the best shampoo and conditioner I've ever used. It makes my hair look and smell good.
B00L2SWF7K|5|Excellent
B000GLRREU|5|I have used a Waterpik on and off since I was a child.  They have always been great for getting the bits out from between teeth (and under hard to reach places such as a bridge).  Our old one sprung a leak (they do tend to wear out after awhile) and we got this new model.  The design is nicer and sleeker.  The extra attachments are hidden away in the lid and the handle has a swivel feature to direct the spray which makes it easier than the old model.  A Waterpik is also perfect for those who aren't so fond of flossing.  I do floss these days but there were years when I used the Waterpik alone to keep my gum health.
B000EY4YLS|5|I've read a lot about sunscreens and according to a review by the Environmental Working Group this sunscreen was rated very good at protecting against UV-A and UV-B rays and absorbing them before it gets to your skin. It is non-toxic,not greasy, and fragrance free so it won't irritate your skin nor your eyes. Most other brands make my eyes water but not this one. It is also highly resistant to water and perspiration and it works! Give it a try and see for yourself.
B007XA49O8|5|I did a lot of research on stretch marks and how to avoid them when I got pregnant. Now my dr said there wasn't anything you could do to avoid them, it just depended on weight gain ( I also read it was hereditary and my mom has them). But I order this avocado oil, almond oil and jojoba oil and used all of it throughout my pregnancy. Other than feeling like I was dipped in a deep fryer for a little while, it worked wonders!! I don't have a stretch mark to show and I feel like it was because I was religious with this regimen and didn't miss a day (a little obsessive). I didn't like cocoa butter b/c it never gets absorbed and just stays greasy, but this does absorb into your skin if you give it a little while and rub it in. I didn't gain weight super fast either so that could have helped, but I fully believe that this works!!
B00J97OA10|4|The product is well made and looks great but doesn't fit well at all.
B007NY9UL6|3|This lotion smells really good. If you like a sweet smell then this is the product for you. This is a really nice gift to give to someone.
B0019FHTAY|5|It came in right away; and I bought it for my daughter since she is into the Zebra print now; she loves it and I love it also.
B002AMUI9Y|5|I know it costs a bit more than the regular stuff you find, but I will pay a little extra to get what I want. I love the fragrance, it's just right and not overpowering at all, plus it gets nice and sudsy!
B00CIX1SLW|5|I think so far, this is a great product. I had bags under my eyes that nothing worked to tone them down. I believe with a little time, this may be the product to assist in lessening them. I do see a difference, and skin feels very smooth.
B00XJRQ70I|5|I am not easily impressed or often impressed really. However this product took me by storm! I was not expecting an item quite of this caliber when using it. It is amazing how an item that costs substantially less than its competitors, is able to do the job just as well if not better! I bought a similar item at a local pharmacy, spend way over $80 and the product broke within a month! Are you kidding me?!  I had this item for a while now, and love it! I use it weekly! It saves me going to the dentist as my teeth look whiter much longer! It also has 3 settings to maximize comfort so everyone can find their preferred setting.  The oral massage this thing gives is out of this world! After use, my mouth never felt healthier.  Thank you for producing this awesome product, and offering it at a great price! I just don’t know how they do it!!! 5 STARS!!!!
B000C21BHC|5|excellent
B00J2AP842|5|I have always loved Gillette razors but this one is just pure awesome. I love how Gillette razors tend to last so much longer then other brands. They also give you a clean shave as well. Their razors are lightweight and even though the replacement cartridges can be a little pricey, they are well worth it. Gillette gave me this product to try for free and I am glad they did.
B000CSLIJM|2|Too thin. When I put my hair into a pony tail I like to be able to pull the elastic up a little so my hair will slip out easier. These are too thin to do that and I had to pull it through the length of my hair and I hate doing that because it always causes breakage!
B000UJQFH8|5|Love it!
B0026MRA1W|4|cant beat the price the only issues I had was if you use regular shaving cream such as barbasol  you will get shave burn/rash I had to switch to the shave gel and it seemed to solve the problem and they tend to rust so I currently switched to feather brand blades and  very happy there much more shaper than derby and give a close nice shave
B00RPLSTP0|5|Absolutely in love with this Lemon Oil! Great smell and many different ways to use it-thats exactly what I expected from this product. Worth trying!
B008RS4LO8|5|my sister likes them
B004ZI8C9O|5|I rarely wear any fragrance because they all seem too heavy to me.  This is light enough for me to wear everyday!  I ordered this gift pack because the bottle is small enough to carry on a plane.  When it arrived, it looked like my full sized bottle... turned out my full size bottle was small enough!  But it looks bigger, so be sure that the label is still on the bottle, because airport security thought it was too big too!<br /><br />Love this... light, fresh & clean!
B002MBNZMA|3|I love the smell and lightness and protection provided, but minus two stars because with my particular skin:<br /><br />-it's hard to rub in/absorbs poorly: sometimes little flaky white pieces never dissolve<br />-if you sweat, it will sweat right off<br />-it looks opaque, like mildly ghastly, on the skin<br /><br />Plus side: It smells lovely and when I did wear it, I never got burnt wearing it even in intense Australian sun.<br /><br />But in the end, I ended up using it on my chest and arms instead of on my face as intended, because constant facial reapplication of a poor facial product is no fun. If you wear it in a tropical or humid place, be prepared to put it on multiple times as it quickly sweats off. Regardless of your location (as with other sun products) try to apply it 20-30 minutes before you go out in the sun, for better chances of absorption.
B003H8180I|2|The tip of this lip liner is so stiff that it is hard to put on.  I don't know if it will get softer with use or not.
B00AOCO636|5|Okay, I've read all the reviews, all the comments & I waited about six months before I hit the send button this purchase. Here are my observations after one week:<br />Very simple set-up<br />Lightweight & easy to move; I have mine stored in between a couple of file cabinets on a piece of old carpet that I can slide out when I want to position it.<br />Noise level: weird. My son says he can hear it in the kitchen downstairs coming from the ceiling. My hubby can hear it from his office in the next room.  The vendor says that if the sound it makes is not one that implies 'rubbing' or 'scraping' or some other malfunction, and it works, then he would assume it is just the operation that produces the sound. Best I could describe it would be like a hand mixer on very slow speed: rrrrrr-rrrrr-rrrrr-rrrrr-  Luckily, I use headphones to watch stuff on my PC or it would be too noisy for me.  My hearing aids pick up the higher frequencies which just makes it worse, hence the headphones.<br />Operation: easy-peasy.  Took about a minute to figure out.  I alternate between forwards and backwards, include arm stretches, adjust the area where it's pressing on the seat by just shifting a bit.  Most I've done so far is 30 minutes at a time.  Go slow to warm up a bit before really getting going; makes a good cool-off process, too.<br />As far as the handle: I don't really use it that much. As I said, I alternate in order not to get bored or tight, which means I'm not in any one position for long enough for it to matter.  Hold on to the back of the seat for a bit, do some bicep curls, & so forth. It's almost like letting yourself do dance moves with your arms, if you get bored in the same position.<br />Foot bars: I do barefoot running, so the bars are not a problem for me at all, in fact I like a little pressure on the soles of my feet, but as someone said, it's not necessary to put a lot of pressure, it's more about body movement to get it going. If you wear something like vibrams, that's perfect, I think.  Or sandals would work, too.<br />So far, I've felt the most change in my legs; going up and down stairs seems a bit easier.<br />(Full disclosure: I am 65 years old & in good health.)<br />UPDATE:<br />Another benefit I'm seeing: increased pelvic muscle strength--older women may appreciate this!<br />10/11/14 UPDATE:<br />I'm going to send this one back; it's just making too much noise & after Hammacher actually advertised it in their emails using a review that pronounced it '100% silent!!!!!', I'm guessing one of two things: either that guy is just lying (unlikely) or mine is defective: still functioning, but apt either to suddenly fail, or wear out fast.<br />Will update again.<br />11/5/2014 FINAL UPDATE (I hope)<br />Sent the old one back & just got the replacement. Verdict: still noisy. Hubby sez it sounds the same as the previous one; I think it may be pitched a little higher perhaps--in any case, it clearly is not, and never was designed to be '100% Silent'--that's just not possible, given its function. Soooo, guess I'll live with it. Caveat emptor.Or sandals would work, too.  So far, I've felt the most change in my legs; going up and down stairs seems a bit easier.

B004ZLBXCY|5|Hairatin fibers are a lifesaver! By adhering to the hair that you have they give the appearance of a full head of hair.
B001IDZHZG|1|This worked fine for the first few times I used it. Like most people I used it for a couple of minutes at a time, then again a few days later, etc. After about a month, which corresponded to less than 30 minutes total use, it spun to a halt. After recharging overnight, it worked for another few minutes, then stopped again. Clearly something malfunctioned with the motor and/or battery. Too cheap to return, what a waste of money.
B002HTREHE|5|Very moist
B002Y1451S|3|Fine product, but not in my top 10.  Honestly I was expecting a little more from this given the many fine reviews.  I found that it gives a good shave and lathers well but neither the performance nor the aroma is good enough to make a place in my regular rotation.  Consistency is as a hard soap, so people looking for &#34;cream&#34; style should look elsewhere.  (This was a plus for me.)<br /><br />Very solid performer but not worth the effort given some of the other great alternatives.  I'd rank it with Van Der Hagen (which I like).
B00A6VYJZU|4|Great product!
B001E2RGY6|4|I like this product  but gives the hair piece an oily feel
B009L1AGPI|5|This color is so pretty I ordered more for my friends because they were jealous! On it's own, it is very light... but I like putting it over colors to get a nice effect-- I have put it over a brown and a red and it looks awesome!
B008LUBKXW|5|My local natural food market stopped carrying Griffin products (It's a long story).  I suffer from dry scalp and this conditioner, combined with the shampoo is the only one I have found that keeps the flaking down to a bare minimum.  Griffin products are wonderful, but they are becoming harder to locate.
B003V32UAQ|5|My husband needed a refill for his razor. It was easy to remove the old blades then add this new one.
B008RFMQGQ|3|Honestly I Dont Know What To Say, It Burned My Skin It Left Some Parts Of My Skin Lighter And Others Darker
B00N9P7AWO|5|&#34;Love, love, love these! Shipping was fast and I love the packaging they came in too... I highly recommend them and this seller... Great job!! These are like nothing you've ever tried... :)&#34;
B001OMVB38|5|Ha Conk a conk chonk conk conk ka.  Jim Morrison
B002PB7KBO|5|I Love the Murad Resurgence Hydrating Toner.
B004SHEQ2Y|4|It's a great moisturizer for the face and neck...wish they made one for the hands. Cheap too! Came in sealed so I know it's new. I can't find this in the city I live in so I'm glad they have at amazon.
B000NVPPDS|4|Tone Skin Care Bars of soap with Cocoa Butter and Botanicals (including aloe and papaya) does moisturize your skin while cleansing it as a type of soap with water. The bars are easy to hold onto in the shower; and the moisturizing additives (including the cocoa butter) make a big difference between this and regular soap.<br /><br />Tone may call these \\"skin care bars;\\" but rest assured you will find them in the soap aisle of your supermarket. Tone advertises them as \\"skin care bars\\" to try to set them apart from the other soaps; but this still remains a type of soap.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these bars of soap have a slight smell that I don't care for. I can't quite describe it in words; but I assume other people must like the scent for Tone to keep on selling. However, if you're allergic to perfumes and scents, this would not be the soap for you.<br /><br />All in all, this is good soap for persons who want a soap that helps you moisturize your skin when you're in the shower or bathtub. I personally don't care for the smell although others may like it.<br /><br />Three and one-half stars.
B001LY7FRK|3|Fair, not good for my face. I feel like these soaps really depend on the person, so the review reflects my experience. It reminds me of a bar of dove soap, and I was not super impressed with the lather from it. Worth giving it a shot based on other more positive reviews.
B0044E9TDM|5|This polish is fantastic! It's on the cheap side and it dries super fast. Maybe 1-2 minutes for the 2nd coat and I make pretty thick coats. Lasts quite a while and comes out very smooth. It has a wider brush then most polish and I love that about this brand. Also head over heels for the color blazing blue, it's a very deep dark navy blue and one of my favorite nail polish colors ever.
B004P8BA8O|5|Smells so good. Goes on smoothly and absorbs well. Very nice scent.<br />Lasting and pleasent. Relaxing scent to wear all day.
B001E0R2YM|5|I initially tried the Giovanni Body Wash while visiting my sister in CA.  She said she bought it at Whole Foods, but when I returned home, my Whole Foods did not carry it.    Of course, I checked Amazon and it was there....and for a good price.  It was then that I noticed the Body Scrub too.  I purchased both items and was so pleased that I did.    First, I love the scent...its very unique.  Clean, fresh and not \\"perfumey\\"...very natural.  I use this both as a Body Wash as well as a bath additive.   Its not overly \\"sudsy\\" which I like. It rinses well and leaves behind fresh, clean and soft skin.   I'm very, very happy with this purchase and will definitely purchase it from Amazon again.    This would make a great gift for the \\"product\\" junkies in your life!
B001VCE8EU|5|Makes a wonderful travel package.  The razor is a nicely made product. The case includes a built in mirror and five DE blades. Excellent value.
B007PCM87O|2|I only use the red handle but thats what the problem is, it doesn't securely clip together. Beyond that the product is great
B0056YTS7G|5|My little girl has always been somewhat tender headed, not enough to prevent styling, wearing bows or any of the other normal girly stuff we want to do with her hair, yet enough to make swimming pool tangles and windy days somewhat of a pain to brush away. I searched Amazon for a solution to tangles in general and saw the reviews for the &#34;Tangle Teaser&#34;.  Let me just say, I've ordered another &#34;Tangle Teaser&#34; just in case something happens to the first. My daughter won't do a spend the night without this brush and carries it every where she goes. She's 12 and keeps an eye on her &#34;brush&#34; better than her cell phone! Whenever she spends the night or one of friends stay the night, they all take turns using this brush. I've had mothers and daughters ask where I found it and how to order one for themselves. I know we love this brush, I can only imagine how much more we would love it if we were as tender headed as I've known some little girls to be. The Tangle Teaser may be pricey, but it's totally worth it. I advise ordering two, because you're going to want a back up.
B00IHVLPLM|5|Smells great and gives a nice look to your beard I'm very happy with it also the stickers are cool.
B00GOYTX90|5|I ordered this to use with Young Living Essential Oils, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  It distributes a generous mist of oils and does not leave any residue or water on the surface.  (There is no necessity to place it on a towel.)  I love that you can program it to run for up to 10 hours...most diffusers will only run 3-6 hours maximum.  I put it by my daughter's bed at night when she was getting sick, and she was good as new in the morning.
B00DGRDQC8|3|My only complaint is that I wish it held a charge longer. Other than that its a great option for men!
B00MOW8IME|4|The wig came really fast the only thing I dont understand is why in the front theres like really crispy and bad hair when in the whole wig the hair is soft... Anyway the hair is gorgeous and feels natural
B0084JAE2I|1|I specifically ordered the 1mm rhinestones but the wheel that arrived only contained 2mm ones. I decided to keep them anyway, though. I read in the reviews that it was hit or miss whether customers wind up with the 1mm or 2mm, so I tried ordering the same 1mm size a second time, but once again it was only 2mm that arrived. I'm keeping both because they only cost a few dollars and shipping it back to Asia is more inconvenient than having a lifetime supply of tiny rhinestones. : )<br />In conclusion: if you REALLY want 1mm/super-tiny rhinestones then don't bother with this gamble. If you don't mind pretty-small ones then they're fine.
B003BVINRC|5|I order these for my son as it's much cheaper than buying at a drug/grocery store and he loves them.
B00OTR07LW|1|One star, because I can't give any less than that.  These pellets smell bad!!!  (Unless you want your whole house to smell of stale smoke.)  I had to put this bag of pellets into another zip up baggy and put them in my closet, to keep the smell from taking over my house.    I need beeswax for making lip gloss, solid perfumes, and other beauty products and I simply can't use these.  If I were to heat them up to melt, the whole house would smell even more horrible and I'm afraid no amount of essential oils could cover up the smell.    I had read reviews on other available products that said they smelled smoky, so I bought these instead. They didn't have any reviews at the time I placed my order, so I was taking a risk which I now regret.  I e-mailed customer service and they did work very quickly to correct the problem.  But since this rating is for the product and not the customer service, I have to give these one lonely star.
B001AV5U80|4|I like the smell and this makes my one year old's curls look great.
B000XE7PV0|1|Unfortunately I am not sure this is the real stuff.  The lid is darker blue and the scent doesn't last very long, which leads me to believe this is a knock off.  I wish I had returned it.
B003NS2HWU|5|No other product gives me the clear skin like this one. It is dark, thick, and earthy and applies on my face well. In 10-15 mins its hardened and I can actually see my pores expanded through the dried clay. Washing it off leaves my skin absolutely radiant!
B00D62S8D0|5|Just as good as the set for 190$$$ at the shaving store at the mall. One thing tho. After a few uses the brush looks like a beaver that lost an argument with a Mack truck. In the rain. LoL.
B001G3TGT6|4|yes i love this clear nail tips. it perfect for any colors glitter.you get them for a very cheap price! 500 hundred a bag. that is a whole lots of tips i'll tell you that! awesome price that anywhere else.
B00CDJAMNG|4|It's a decent brush set def not real wood or bamboo but that's whatever.<br />Its synthetic bristles not real. But the brushes work great don't shed that much at all so its not bad
B00JWV5GZC|3|This is not a bleaching cream! It made me even darker. The only thing good about it is that it evens the skin.
B0029LF0NU|4|Super cute in my swim bag
B000AMBEPI|5|Very nice microfiber and is very absorbent. One towel for my Weimaraner! Has held up nicely and I have been using it for several years now.
B009GYVMAS|5|This mud mask is amazing. It absolutely cleared out and tightened my pores and left my skin feeling amazing. Will certainly buy again.
B006P0LF7G|4|These 12-pack softsoaps cost less than $5 at your local Costco warehouses! As for the product itself, I like it. It has a very smooth texture, it doesn't get soggy, and it has a good smell.
B00KMCEA4S|5|I had so many skin problems that it was hard to believe! I had dry skin, hairline wrinkles, red skin, you name it, I had the problem. This product cleared up all of those problems, and left my skin feeling smooth and strong. I am a long-time user of this product and I don't see myself giving it up anytime soon.
B00138Y8PQ|5|If you have slightly to moderately dry hair, I would recommend this.  I use it with the Silkening conditioner and I can tell the difference from the Color Treated Aquage shampoo.  It feels silkier and easier to manage.  Been using Aquage for years, pricey but worth it.
B0077PLNB6|1|I purchased this item when I 'lost' my Braun epilator. This has to be the worst (& most expensive) shaver that I have ever purchased. To be fair it may be operator error or a faulty product & I would hope to hear from Braun to discuss this but I am not holding my breath!<br /><br />I am currently reduced to wet shaving with cuts everywhere until I can order another shaver!<br /><br />Unless I hear from Braun I will not be buying from them again!
B007480TQ6|5|I've been using this shampoo for over a year now and my hair feels great.  Usually, I will feel build-up and my hair will begin to feel coarse, but not with Pureology.  I also like that it's sulfate free.
B007TYWFDA|1|Well it sorta made my boobs a lil perky but the butt cream didnt work at all. This product isnt worth the money/time.
B00K26CNNE|5|Love it
B000TG0TSS|5|smells wonderful and lasts a long time!
B00F6P30FG|5|Fits perfect. I wear this everywhere. No one can tell that the sparkle is not real. BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT, PRETTY PIECE.
B00DVSELOO|5|It has been the best moisturizer I have ever had.  I really like the way it makes my skin feel and how my makeup goes on.  My makeup also seems to last longer through the day. My sister is now using it too!
B002OXEURA|5|very happy with this product, very easy to use, easy to clean, does not hurt when using close to the gums, or even in pockets, am very happy I purchased these.
B000GJIQ9M|5|This is the only razor I use now!!!! I first used this a few years ago and I was hooked. I am totally satisfied.
B001FB5HW4|5|love the ingredients.  love how my skin looks when i wake up the following morning.  i would highly recommend this!
B009NPOY14|1|I have ordered this brand of perfume several time from Amazon previously for my wife with no issues. This is my wife's favorite brand of perfume. I ordered this as a gift for her. When she opened it the perfume looked ok, but was very stale and pungent. The perfume smelled old, very musty, like it has been sitting around too long. Needless to say she was unable use this perfume. We were both very disappointed in this product.
B00KSNTNNO|5|Great quality.  One of the best I have seen!  You will not be sorry you chose this one. I promise.
B003FZIWZW|5|This eyeliner exceeded my expectations.  I'd buy again.
B00M1E5F1W|1|This replacement head is absolutely terrible. I was very happy with my purchase of the Norelco razor with the original heads and now I feel like I've been ripped off. The new head feels terrible and sticks against your face. The blades don't shave as closely as the old head and they constantly pull at your hairs. I ended up getting more irritation than I ever have in the past. This truly is a terrible product and its bad enough that I'm considering getting rid of my Philips Norelco and replacing it with something else.
B001RJ7MRM|4|Terrific!
B000068PBT|4|as advertized
B002PCPZQA|5|Just as described.  Gave as gifts and most report they like it better than there regular electric shaver.
B005FJQQMC|5|I love my dotting tools. They are everything I expected. They make nail art so much easier. They arrived on time with no problem.
B00009YJSJ|5|I was unable to find a comparable product at the local big box stores.<br /><br />I was pleased to find this at a price that was approximately 50% less than other retailers and websites.<br /><br />Works great and does not take up additional counter top in bathroom.
B004G46DIY|4|I love this product!<br /><br />I have dry skin and bumps on my upper arms, and they have diminished in size and frequency since using this product. I use it whenever I shower, and it exfoliates my skin and leaves a smooth feeling behind. There is a slight oily sensation on my arms immediately after using it in the shower, but that absorbs into the skin minutes after drying off. The aroma of citrus is an amazing way to wake up and feel energized in the morning!<br /><br />My only concern with this product is that after many uses, it can leave the bottom of your tub/shower feeling sticky. This is why I only gave it a 4/5 star rating. I clean my tub regularly, so this is not really an issue for me. But it is definitely something to consider. It doesn't make it dangerously slick, just sort of tacky...
B002GUIDEM|1|not good
B00BL2RB58|4|Good
B002Q81RK6|5|Very easy to apply and leaves your hair in beautiful condition and  also covers gray hair. I do leave in a little longer for processing.
B005IR3FS4|5|I ordered 5 KleanColor nail polishes and absolutely love them. The colors are true to what I saw pics of online and they're good quality thick full coverage and they arrived in perfect condition and sooner than it said they would be here.
B0033DPIGW|5|I love this scent.  I bought it even though I have tons of bottles of lotion from hotel stays.  I love the cologne, too, but this is great when I want a lighter touch.  It's very pricey for a small bottle of lotion, though, so I use it sparingly.
B009JO4CZM|5|This gloss is really nice.  The consistency isn't runny or sticky. Some people compare this gloss to MAC's lipglass but I don't own one of those so all I can say is that this gloss is wonderful. There are small sparkles in it..not over powering at all but I will say when wiping it off be careful because if you smear it, the sparkles will get on your face. Keep in mind all of the glosses on this line don't have sparkles but this one happens to have them. Other than that I love it. As far as this color, I am African American with brown skin (I wear either NW45 or NC50 in MAC) so with it alone it looks a little light for me but with brown liner it works great. Lately I've been using it as a topper for one of my nude pink lipsticks...great combination.
B006M16L9K|5|spray perfume, and the fragrance is perfect. Package arrived in perfect condition and it even had the original maroon box.
B002KP1WIW|5|excelente producto
B00DUW5AOG|3|Not thrilled but it'll work. It's really just a nylon blend surgical mask. Probably not the warmest material they could've used but it cuts the cold wind a little. But not a whole lot better than exposed skin. Not really worth the $5 or so that I spent, in my opinion. It's def acrylic and not cotton at all.
B001CT0AGC|5|Excellent. i have no complains what so ever about the product. The package was delivered very quickly and item was exactly as described.
B000I1S18Y|3|This is the only thing I'm using for cutting my hair now. It has been 2-3 year since we bought it and it still working great.
B0056AY5GY|5|I like to use this in the morning and it helps wake me up.  Very refreshing.  Smells nice.  My skin looks and feels clean.  Overall, great exfoliating scrub.
B0041PFUV4|5|Love this product my hair has never felt so clean or soft
B00A9NLVAG|5|Love this products.
B005EHHWPA|5|The nail polish color is exactly as shown, came right on time, loved it! I did not have any problems with this, did not come broken, absolutely a bargain!
B00GOZEFP6|5|great lotion and speedy delivery. fantastic smell
B0002KHU3I|5|Good
B001KNHM4I|5|My favourite hairspray!
B002SQ4P5A|5|good
B009P4EAF8|5|I'm a makeup artist, do wedding makeup, and wear lashes almost every day. This glue is the best. Nothing compares.
B0002Z8P8W|1|Felt good on hair at first, then began to make hair feel dryer and straw like. My hairs curly and frizzy<br />Don't recommend for thick hair
B001RPL902|5|My wife and I like it. Nothing bad to say about it.<br />Helps with those small stubborn hairs.<br />Came very fast in the mail.
B00006WNQS|1|Horrible!!  Gave it away
B003U05566|4|I like this soap but didn't rate it a<br /> Five because I only used it<br />once.<br />The bar was a little smaller then I thought but I would buy it again.
B000H7Y250|5|Excellent shave with Braun Series 7 + original pulsonic cartridge (blue cutting strip). Just about as close as 5 blade Panasonic (wet shave) but more comfortable.
B0017QK4HA|5|Have used Mac for a number of years and will continue to use this product.
B001ET7GLW|5|This soap is rather expensive but well worth the price - it weighs about 6 oz. It retains it's suds throughout use of the entire bar. It would probably outlast other brands on the market. The soap has a pleasant aroma and really does the job with washing your entire body! It is made in several scents but this is the one I like best (Wild Rose Petals). Enjoy!
B0035LCW0W|5|Not much to say - the adhesive worked perfect.  Dries quick but gives you enough time to work with it.  I like the dark because it blends in better.  The clear didn't actually try clear fur me.
B00HB4O7I4|5|I LOVE WATCHING DUCK DYNASTY!!! I LOVE the family & their friends! I love many of their products, BOOKS especially. This zippered pillowcase is beautiful, deep saturated colors & LARGER than I anticipated, which is a plus. GREAT product for me.
B00AVXTI3Q|2|This product has glitter in it. I would not recommend it for anyone who is old enough to use moisturizer. I did not expect to find such bling in a primer.
B003808XVW|5|These tiny earrings are adorable and my 7 year old granddaughter will love them as a Christmas gift. She love Mickey.
B00J2FS4PC|5|Just stocking up. Estee Lauder is a great facial product.
B0092SVTGA|5|Much better than expected. These are FIRM even when wet but they're about the same as using my fingers with great control and way less mess. Excellent value, and then package is cute. This would be a nice stocking stuffer or small gift.
B001B54XL0|3|not so good
B00O5Q5HIU|5|Ok, not really magic, but this stuff makes my hair shine without being greasy, smells absurdly phenomenal, and is absolutely not making my color fade. I got this in a Glossybox originally, and bought another one and the shampoo and conditioner, I loved it so much. The scent stays in my hair all day!
B004PCSOCU|5|so sorry this has been discontinued as it is my go to shampoo
B008IEJXP8|5|I have been using this blush for years and will continue to buy it. It's a great blush. Lovely color. A little goes a long way..don't dab your brush too much because it will get everywhere. Mine has never smelled bad...some reviews of the strawberry products ( especially the lip gloss) have mentioned gross odors but my blushes have been fine.
B004CDQ73K|5|My current favorite sunscreen for the face. I have melasma so I use this product every day and wear a hat (socal sun is brutal on melasma!) Even thought it's non-nano, it's not as white as other high zinc screens and is easy to disguise with a little powder/bronzer (I skip the powder most of the time unless I need to look put together). It doesn't make me break out either. So glad I found this product! Works great and reasonably priced.
B00NFDKQHG|3|I liked it. It's not as fancy as the picture makes it look like though.  It is actually made out of a spandex material. When I got it, I was a little iffy but then when I tried it on,  it looked really good. This is something I would wear as a maxi dress,  not really the type for prom.
B00DYYKQZS|5|I LOVE this stuff!  It makes my skin so soft, and it doesn't feel dry.  It also allows for my make-up to go on so easily and I need to use less!<br />Doesn't get much better than that!
B00HHN8NES|5|Love it! There was a small crack in it though but idc.. Definitely getting a couple more:)
B002CVTVVY|5|I never realized you could get that dentist level of clean at home until I tried the Philips Sonicare. This is a terrific tool to have for daily use. It has a 30 second timer for each section of your teeth for a full two minutes of cleaning. This toothbrush leaves your teeth feeling super clean and your breath fresher. The different levels for your gums is terrific. My dentist will be very happy to see me next go round. I can't see me ever going back to manual brushing!
B000V2ACHI|5|GATSBY MAKES SOME OF THE BEST PRODUCTS AND THIS DOESN'T FALL SHORT... IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A MEDIUM TO FIRM HOLD THIS IS THE STUFF FOR YOU , THE PRICE WAS GREAT COMPARED TO WHAT MY STYLIST SELLS IT FOR.. SO ITS ALWAYS A BUY FOR ME
B00KVOKJ1A|4|Love this gel polish!!!! I got the classic galaxy and both the blue and purple are beautiful!!!! I tend to not get a lot of gradient in the nails because they often are one color or the other depending on my hand warmth, but the colors do switch a lot during the day even with small temperature changes. Even without getting to see both colors at once very often, it's still beautiful and feels like I keep changing my nail polish...without the hassle of actually having too!! I used 2 coats for a complete color saturated look, but I could of easily done one coat if I wanted a lighter look. I am definitely going to be ordering more of this polish! It's a bit pricey (hence the 4 stars), but so far there isn't much out there like it, so the price will have to do :-)
B0081U9M6E|5|Beautiful fragrance and soothing lotion.
B00LMQG8E8|2|Purchased for my sister for Christmas. They came beautifully packaged and shipped on time. Super soft brushes. But 2 of the brushes came apart as I was inspecting them. :/ if that hadn't happened, I would easily give 5 stars and would order a set for myself!
B0090UJFYI|2|This one did not do anything effective for my skin...
B000217M26|1|I have been wearing this cologne for 15 years. And THIS is NOT Tuscany.<br /><br />Oh... the bottle looks real but this stuff is a cheap knockoff. If I sound pissed... it's because I just spend $50 on a FAKE that I cannot return.<br /><br />Come on Amazon... really?
B000VYWS6Y|4|This gel is much darker than other 'dark brown' gels I have used. A little goes a loooooooooong way. If you get it on your skin, it makes your skin look a little dirty, but if you take the time to veeery carefully apply (difficult!) to just the hairs of your eyebrows, you will be rewarded with magnificently bold, expressive brows that won't quit. This stuff just stays and stays and stays. In fact, if you are like me and you are way too lazy about bedtime makeup removal, then forget to set your alarm in time to take a shower in the morning, you can just go ahead and wear those smokin' hot brows right on through the next day.
B002N5MHLU|2|This review will address a DRY SHAVE ONLY as I've never used this product for a wet shave. I purchased it to replace a Braun 7505 that I'd had for years. The reviews on Amazon were so overwhelmingly positive for the ES-LA63 that I decided to order it online, which I prefer not to do with razors b/c it makes returning them more difficult. I have a thick beard and was hoping this model would reduce the shaving time I had with my Braun. I was disappointed. After using it for a month I'm sorry to say it takes me longer to shave with the Panasonic. At a $300 MSRP that's just not acceptable (I got it on sale for $150).<br /><br />For men with lighter beards this razor may work just fine, but I still think it's overpriced. My sense is that you're paying for bells and whistles you don't really need: e.g. the detailed display with battery life and cleaning notification. Also, the head is quite large. It's fine on my cheeks but not so good on my upper lip, chin and neck. Also, the trimmer is smaller than on Braun shavers and it's difficult to deploy it. I have to push quite hard to get it to pop up.<br /><br />I just purchased a new Braun 380s for half the price of the Panasonic ES-LA63 and it outperforms the Panasonic. Again, every man's beard is different, but from my experience this razor is overpriced and overrated. I'm sticking with Braun.
B004PXIR1W|1|I thought it was a great trimmer but I found out that it cannot be used plugged in to an outlet if the battery has little or no charge (at least with the one I have). What happens is it'll turn on but then after some time the motor will slow down 'till it stops. Being plugged in has no effect except charging it when it's not being used/turned on. Once you turn it on it stops charging the unit and starts using battery power exclusively. I thought I had found the trimmer of all trimmers but it'll be useless (it won't turn on) once the battery dies permanently. A friggin' shame really.
B000ROI2ZE|2|I'm giving the seller 2 stars not because the product isn't great but because of the seller's $8 shipping charge.  The shipping for this product was just as much as it's cost...this is ridiculous and a rip off.
