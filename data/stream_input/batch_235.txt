B000063UR2|5.0|Upon first inspection it's obvious a lot of work went into this release.<br />I've been watching this film on syndication or cable since I was a child but watching the extended cut made me feel like I was watching a whole new film.  The video quality is astounding, allowing the customes and lush backdrops to be seen in all their glory.<br />The DTS soundtrack brings it alive and there are times where you feel like you've been pulled into Ridley Scott's fairy tale.<br />If it seems like I'm gushing, well I am.  The ultimate edition brings an already very good film on par with LOTR as far as pleasing your eyes and ears and without the luxury of motion capture and computer graphics.

B00004XQ83|5.0|\\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" is fantastic! This record is not only introducing a new generation of music fans to bluegrass roots music, but it's doing it with a slew of top-notch songs that'll get stuck in your head for weeks. Each of the tracks on here offers something different for the listener. You've got the eerie vocals of Emmylou, Alison, and Gillian on *Didn't Leave Nobody But The Baby*, the sheer acapella simplicity of Ralph Stanley's *O Death*, and the original recordings of bluegrass folk standards *Angel Band* and *Big Rock Candy Mountain*. You also get a taste of the blues and its relationship to bluegrass with Chris Thomas King's *Hard Time Killing Floor Blues*. --- It has always been said that country music and blues music are just a beat away! Even the instrumental versions of *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow* add flavor to the album and also bring out something new to the song itself. Then there's the reworked covers of familiar songs like *In The Jailhouse Now* and *You Are My Sunshine*. Alison Krauss and the backing choir in *Down To The River To Pray* will take your breath away and who can ever forget the bouncy instrumentation and catchy lyrics in the Soggy Bottom Boys' *I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow*. As a whole, the soundtrack will paint lots of pictures in your mind, primarily taking you to a dusty road in the middle of a tallgrass field. The songs range from hardcore bluegrass to \\"newgrass\\", making this a nice introduction for new fans of the genre. Pick this record up today and join in on the fun, for you will not be disappointed!<br />Thanks for reading!
B00003CXA6|5.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; is a monumental effort to depict the Civil War events of July 3-5,1863 in Pennsylvania and succeeds magnificently on all levels. Both from an historical and theatical perspective, this movie is a &quot;must-see&quot;. On the historical side, this movie manages to portray the personalities with both historical accuracy and believability...one cannot help but like and admire the principals on both sides. Tom Berenger is magnificent as &quot;Ol' Pete&quot; Longstreet as is Jeff Daniels playing Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain...I had a little harder time accepting Martin Sheen as R.E. Lee. Although wonderfully acted, Sheen just did not fit my impressions of Lee (I probably have seen him too much on &quot;West Wing&quot;). The battle scenes, to me, were the best I've seen in movie form...both the 20th Maine's stand on Little Roundtop and Pickett's charge were amazingly portrayed and highly accurate...I could not find any historical in-acurracies in any of these scenes (I don't consider myself an expert in Civil War military tactics, however). From a theatrical perspective, this had all the high quality cinematography and direction that makes for epic films...both the battle scenes and the one-on-one personal encounters were wonderfully depicted. For anyone interested at all in the Civil War or anyone wanting to watch a classic movie, this is one to see. I highly recommend it!
B00005YW4H|1.0|Thats right Track number one is the only thing worth listening too. After that the rest put me to sleep . Arif hired all the big names to back her up but they fell asleep too. On most of the song she plays pianismo on the keys and is singing to just herself in a little room. The roots and presentation of the song make me wonder Bluegrass? Jazz? Country? Pop?. So I sold the CD to someone at the Office. Yes Norah has a fine voice on the next CD please lose that annoying whisper and pick up the tempo Like maybe a collection of jazzy songs that were on Diana Kralls earlier CD's.
B000066NW0|5.0|Gotta listen to this...different, unique, fresh and sassy,<BR>yet bold and distinct! Will catch your attention at very <BR>first listen. &quot;Complicated&quot; is already a chart-topping (top<BR>20) single in the US. My kudos to this rising star! -- Ban
B00003CXI0|3.0|This video is a delight to kids in upper elementary school but is dark and frightening to younger kids. The troll scene and the fight with Voldemort are realistic and as a teacher and parent, I cannot recommend this video to parents with kids under 6. Keep it special for older kids who've read the books.
B00005Y23E|5.0|BOB MARLEY KEPT REGGAE MUSIC REAL AND TRADITIONAL. HE DID NOT TRY TO CHANGE OR MOVE AWAY FROM THE UNIQUE SOUNDS OF REGGAE. PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LOVE HIS MUSIC AND THATS WHY HE WAS AMONG THE ORIGINAL INDUCTEE INTO THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME. I WISH MORE OF TODAYS REGGAE ARTISTS WOULD KEEP THE REGGAE MUSIC TRADITIONAL AND DON'T TRY TO CHANGE IT. MAYBE THEY TOO CAN SOMEDAY BE A LEGEND AND BE INDUCTED INTO THE HALL OF FAME.
0393312836|4.0|A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess was a very good book. It is about a 15 year-old boy and his very violent life. The story takes place in a futuristic city. Alex and his friends go around the city and act like terrors. The story starts to get exciting when he goes to jail and is the test subject for a new method of state reform. I liked this book because it shows that actions have reactions. The bad part about the book is the dialect. I think Anthony Burgess over does the dialect and makes the book hard to understand.
B000066NW0|3.0|I was anticipating Avril Lavigne's debut Cd release because I really liked her song Complicated, featured on MTV's TRL. Getting a biography on her from her website is a big foreshadow to what kind of music would appear on her Cd. She's quite a singer, and a great song writer, but the music her words go to are pretty annoying. When the annoying &quot;rock&quot; I love rock/punk, just this one didn't seem to work that well are taken out to leave a few guitars, and her voice the Cd is amazing. I however would reccomend buying this Cd if only for Complicated, which is a great song! I hope Avrils first Cd will be a success (I bought it today, the first day it's out) so we can hear more from her in the future.. Oh yeah, if you like Britney Spears, you probably won't like Avril Lavigne. She's a complete 180 compared to Spears, thank God..
B00005OAIE|5.0|So many singers in the recent times have been obsessed with creating a fascad genuined emotion-- most of the time, it comes of as such-- that is, most listeners can tell that they are trying to be what they are not.  On the other hand, Mayer comes off as genuinely introspective with his lyrics, while at the same time speaking on subjects that most of us can relate with: themes of love and finding oneself.  Moreover, one can tell that he likes doing this stuff, he loves what he does and he enjoys it, perhaps that is why he comes off as so down to earth.  On a side note, his acoustic renditions speak much more to this much more clearly than the processed sounds of this album.  Nevertheless, I believe this is a great introduction to Mayer's music.  Naturally, I completely disagree with Amazon's review of this record.  Mayer has at once accomplished so much and so much  potential.  Good luck.
B00005J9ZB|5.0|With Arjen Lucassen's first Ayreon album, The Final Experiment, we were treated to a mix of prog rock, prog metal and symphonic power metal. With Ayreon's second effort, Actual Fantasy, we were given a dose of Pink Floyd-ish hard rock. On Into the Electric Castle, all the elements from The Final Experiment and Actual Fantasy are combined into a stunning two-disc &quot;space opera&quot;.<br />As the story of eight strangers from different points in time is told, we are given songs that are reminiscent of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, Rainbow, ELP and Savatage--the full spectrum of classic hard rock and epic rock.<BR>Highlights include:<BR> <BR>&quot;The Decision Tree&quot; - This song is basically an argument between two of the characters, the Barbarian (Jay van Feggelen) and the Highlander (Fish). The Barbarian is arrogant, over-bearing and looking for a fight. The Highlander is tired of fighting but is more than the Barbarian's equal. The give and take between the two is fascinating. And the music gives the argument a sense of urgent playfulness: Both characters' lives are on the line trapped in the Electric Castle, but the Highlander knows that the Barbarian is just a blowhard. <BR>&quot;Across the Rainbow Bridge&quot; - The Knight (Damian Wilson) remembers his yesterdays and the Roman (Edwin Balogh) wants to push forward as they trade off back and forth on lead vocals. The Hippie (Arjen Lucassen) gets involved and then things get spacey. Psychedelic rock and heavy metal are mixed effectively here. <br />&quot;Valley of the Queens&quot; - Anneke van Giershergen (The Gathering) as the Egyptian sings her farewell on the short but incredibly beautiful tune. <BR>&quot;The Two Gates&quot; - The end of the journey has come. And now the remaining five travelers must decide which gate to exit the Electric Castle. And the Barbarian takes things into his own hands. This is the most bombastic and urgent tune on the entire two disc album. <br />Though not as heavy overall as The Final Experiment, there is still enough &quot;heavy rock&quot; to go around on Into the Electric Castle. The eight different singers, representing the eight different characters, are all perfectly cast. Damian Wilson (ex-Threshold) as the Knight and Fish (ex-Marillion) as the Highlander are especially good here. <br />This is a GREAT album. Adventurous, innovative and emotional are all words I would use to describe this wonderful CD. Arjen Lucassen is a superb songwriter, maybe the best in prog rock/prog metal today.  I cannot believe anyone would knock this album, but knock it they do.  The songwriting is good and the production sounds fine to me.  Those who get into production minutia fail to realize what great music is all about--it's the songs, stupid!  Into the Electric Castle is all about songs.<br />Note: The eight characters in Into the Electric Castle are as follows: Knight, Highlander, Barbarian, Futureman, Hippie, Roman, Indian and Egyptian (the latter two are female). Not all make it out of the Electric Castle alive!
6300147630|3.0|\\"The exploding head scene! You gotta see the exploding head scene!\\" I have been hearing that for years, and finally took this little piece of gore out to see the exploding head scene so I could get on with my life. Except for the exploding head scene, this film is pretty mediocre.<br />An evil corporation (are all corporations in sci-fi films evil?) sends a good scanner to kill a bad scanner. Scanners are people who have a vague telekinetic power they achieved after their pregnant mothers took a drug released by the evil corporation. There are good scanners, who gather in little apartments in a circle. They seem to be waiting for the marijuana brownies and the poetry reading. The bad scanners pack heat, and the ability to make people's heads explode. The main good scanner and bad scanner Ironside meet in the end in a silly finale.<br />Aside from the exploding head scene, this was rather a disappointment. The leading man good scanner (Stephen Lack?) is awful. His entire emotional gamut seems to be blank stares and whiny line deliveries. His lines with the over the top Ironside are so flat I thought Ironside might be falling asleep. Patrick McGoohan, as the evil corporation's pawn, slumps in his seat in all his scenes and delivers his lines like he has a mouthful of marbles. Jennifer O'Neill, at the beginning of the end of her career, is simply window dressing to the leading man, running around and ducking for cover. The best actor here is the always underrated Michael Ironside. He relishes his role as the evil scanner, and the movie only lights up when he is onscreen.<br />Whenever someone \\"scans,\\" the actor looks intently at the subject and moves his head a little from side to side, bugging his eyes out slightly and sweating a lot. I did the same thing watching this film. Cronenberg has a good reputation, but I found \\"Scanners\\" a letdown. He let all his earlier success go to his exploding head. I do not recommend it.<br />This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence, strong gore, and some profanity.

B00003CX7L|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen is the Toy Story Trilogy. I do say, that TS is better than TS2, but TS2 is very good.<br />As the title says, this movie is the sequal of Toy Story. In this movie, Woody is stolen by a collector, and now it is up to the Toy gang to get him back.<br />I give this movie a 10/10. It is a very good movie, and great for all ages.<br />Rating: G<br />Ages: 3+
B00005JKG7|5.0|I've been a huge Carpenter fan for many many moons, and this, in my opinion, is one of his best works.  Not very graphic (with a few exceptions), but the kind of edge-of-your-seat nail-biting that can't be accomplished with mere images... in this movie the implied horror is so much worse than anything they could show on the screen!  This movie made me fear a harmless thing like fog!  In short, THIS MOVIE ROCKS.
B00003CXI0|4.0|If you like Lord Of The Rings and the book series Everworld, you will LOVE this movie. According to the title, it is the first movie of the Harry Potter book series, however it is a little bit different. I hate spoilers, so I am not going to tell you what is going to happen. <br />The rating does make it's effect in this movie.<br />Violence: Just a bit. The rating PG. I dont think kids under 10 would understand it.<br />Sex: None.<br />I give it a 7/10 because it really is a very good movie.

B000001EL3|5.0|After the success of ALIVE!, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons decided it was time for Kiss to expand their musical horizons. To this end, Bob Ezrin was hired to bring some polish and new sounds to Kiss' trademark heavy metal stomp. To say Bob was a hard taskmaster would be an understatement; he earned the eternal dislike of Ace Frehley for one and pushed Peter Criss harder than anyone had ever done; however, it was well worth it for DESTROYER ranks as a true classic and half the tracks are still on the Kiss setlist today.<br />DETROIT ROCK CITY - After a Gene Simmons news bulletin and snippet of live Kiss, the band kick into this hymn for a true rock city. The Catman drums harder and faster than ever before. the dual axework between Paul and Ace is breathtaking and the call and response vocal on the chorus makes you want to sing along with it. It all ends with a crash and a lingering guitar note, which leads us into . . .<br />KING OF THE NIGHTTIME WORLD - Great rocker from Paul Stanley and a great song to rock to in a car. All about escaping into the nighttime world, far from the drudgery of everyday life and family. Ace's fretwork contiues to improve with every album.<br />GOD OF THUNDER - Hard to believe Paul Stanley wrote this. Gene roars out his theme song; a true heavy metal classic. Used to bookend the demon's bloodspitting/bass solo routine during the MAKEUP concerts. In case you didn't know, Ezrin taped his sons running around with rayguns and put them on the track to provide suitable eerieness. I love the double tracking of Gene's voice in the second verse. Ace's chops on this track are truly fear inducing.<br />GREAT EXPECTATIONS - A completely different side to Simmons. Gene croons to a fan who wishes to know Gene personally. The choir and orchestra add a new dimension to the Kiss sound, and I'm not surprised that some fans didn't 'get it' at first. <br />FLAMING YOUTH - Another great song of youth rebellion to rank alongside 'Won't get Fooled Agin' and MyGeneration'. Singalong harmonies in the chorus.Screaming axework in the song outro.<br />SWEET PAIN - Gene Simmons rocker, slightly tainted by the fact that Ace Frehley does not appear on this track. When he didn't turn up for this song's session, Bob Ezrin had studio and Alice Cooper guitar slinger Dick Wagner lay done some leadwork. This lead to some conflict between Ace and Bob, that still exists today. Nevertheless, this is a good rocker with a girl backup group giving the song a slight 'Motown' feel.<br />SHOUT IT OUT LOUD - Classic party song, with stellar work by all concerned. The piano gives the track a mid-to-late sixties flavour to it. In concert, all four members contributed vocals to this song. I really love Gene's \\"Oh yeah!\\". Contains a lyric that is basic in rock'n'roll law: \\"Don't let them tell you that there's too much noise, they're too old to really understand\\" !<br />BETH - A recycled song from Peter Criss' old band 'Chelsea'<BR>with a little reworking from Ezrin (with words and orchestra) . The nicest way of telling a nagging loved one to buzz off and leave you alone! Kiss' first biggie and an award winning song to boot (would you ever think the words 'award' and 'Kiss' would ever be heard in the same sentence, hmmmm?).<br />DO YOU LOVE ME - Even a rock star sex god must feel a little insecure sometimes! Paul askes his girl to tell the truth. Great rocker mixed with high vocals, tubular bells (and probably orchestra, too). Now just when you think that's the album over and done with . . .<br />ROCK'N'ROLL PARTY - A snippet of Pauls's stage banter mixed with the choir from 'Great Expectations'; looping continously until fade out.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Arnold plays Cyberdine Systems Model 101, the same cyborg soldier from the first Terminator, but this time he's been reprogrammed for the side of good!  The 'evil' terminator, the top-of-the-line prototype T-1000, is played by the now infamous Robert Patrick (most recently of X-Files fame), who does an excellent job of being menacing without being physically massive like Arnold.  This would be a SIX STAR movie if I could give it that!

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril's been praised for being independent and real - for being herself.  But she's also been criticized for being a \\"fake\\" independent.  Critics say she's just another pop sheep dressed up in a punk wolf's clothing.  But what is important here is not necessarily Avril's image - it's her music.  And whether or not Avril is truly a punk/sk8er or another Britney, her music is not affected and remains solid and true.<br />Her first single, \\"Complicated\\" is more on the pop side of things, according to Avril herself in an interview.  But it isn't the super-sweet, syrupy love songs typical of pop artists.  The theme that permeates the song and Avril's first album, \\"Let Go,\\" is \\"be real.\\"  \\"Complicated\\" is about the facades people put on, about those of us who \\"become somebody else, 'round everyone else.\\"  Avril promotes a respectable message of being true to oneself, and she does so to the tune of original melodies and down-to-earth lyrics.<br />\\"Anything But Ordinary\\" is similar in its message and its pop sounds, but is a different song altogether.  As a 17-year-old, Avril has been called an \\"old soul\\" and for good reason.  She somehow manages to have a deep insight into the true value of life, as she sings, \\"I want to know that I have been to the extreme/So knock me off my feet/Come on now, give it to me/Anything to make me feel alive.\\"  We have but one life, and Avril sings enthusiastically about making the most out of that life by refusing to put on facades and just being oneself.<BR>\\"My World\\" is another pop song.  Upbeat and lighthearted, Avril writes of her life as a smalltown girl from Napanee, Ontario, population 5,000.  <br />The more lyrical songs \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" are beautiful works of musical talent.  Avril's sweet side comes through, as she sings with powerful emotion about past love experiences.  She said in an interview that she needs to sing what comes from her heart; listeners can't doubt that these songs are her personal experiences, as her passion and emotion shines elegantly through.<br />The alternative \\"Mobile,\\" \\"Tomorrow,\\" \\"Too Much to Ask,\\" and \\"Naked\\" demonstrate Avril's wide range of genres.  While not considered \\"slow songs\\" like \\"Things I'll Never say\\" and \\"I'm With You,\\" but not as bouncy and poppy as the first songs mentioned, these alternative tracks provide the same raw emotion of a 17 year old who is wise beyond her years.<br />Avril's eclectic mix is nearly completed with the funky \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" reminiscent slightly of surfer music, and the soft rap of \\"Nobody's Fool.\\"  A white rapper?  Avril does it tastefully and with amazing style to portray her stubborn attitude towards giving in to fake facades and images.  The aforementioned \\"Sk8er Boi\\" is perhaps the only fictional song on the album, although it is rooted in personal experiences, as Avril said she is frequently annoyed by judgments passed because she's a skater.  Critics have snubbed her lyrics as juvenile, especially \\"We rock each others world,\\" but they undoubtedly fit the song's tempo and style, and moreover fit Avril's personality and tendancy to stick with what she thinks fits.  <br />Finally, two slightly darker pieces complete the album.  \\"Unwanted\\" is more of a rock song in which Avril's deep, powerful vocals have been likened to Tori Amos and Alanis Morissette.  \\"Losing Grip\\" actually may not be considered dark by most.  It's simply darker than the pop of \\"Complicated,\\" the track immediately following it.  Nevertheless, it is my favorite track on the album because it displays her voice beautifully.  Her breakdown into the simple repetition of \\"I'm crying out loud, crying out loud...\\" always fills me with awe as I listen to her voice tinkling up and down the uneven scale of notes that makes her voice sound slightly (and beautifully) Irish or Gaelic.  <br />All in all, Avril is the best artist to have come onto the scene in a long while, especially among the popular artists.  She is real and she plans on keeping both herself and her music real.  She has a beautiful and powerful voice, and lyrics that offer deep insights into life and relationships, even though those insights may manifest themselves into teenage lyrics.  But hey, all this is much more than anybody should expect from a mere 17-year old, and Avril deserves two thumbs way up.
B000002UAO|5.0|This album clearly marks the transition between the Beatles' childish music (everything before this album), and their slightly-less childish music (Revolver onwards).  The beatles enormous number of fans failed to realise that other bands were the ones creating truly revolutionary music.  It is the 3 minute mindless pop songs that ruled the charts (and hearts) in the 60s (beatles, monkees), as in the 90s (spice girls, back street boys).  <br />If songs such as &quot;Drive My Car&quot; and &quot;Think For Yourself&quot; were released by Britney Spears (some of hers are actually more profound than these two), you would see them for what they truly are: drivel.  But since the Beatles are beyond any criticism, the absurdity of their popularity and acclaim continues.
B00003CXFG|5.0|When this movie first hit theaters, I passed on it, thinking it was one more blood, guts and CGI waste of two hours.  However, when I finally rented it, it blew me away.  While there's definately suspense and horror, Pitch Black also shows both fantastic character arcs and excellent worldbuilding, both SF musts that are often sadly lacking in SF movies.  Examples: There are multiple races and multiple cultures at work here, from a large contingent of Muslims on pilgrimage (whose language and beliefs are wonderfully in evidence) to an extinct race of landwalkers.  The technology that survived an earlier colonization is all solar powered, because why use other energy on a planet where the sun is almost always shining? (major power problems ensue when the sun goes down, obviously.)  Instead of just creating random aliens, the writers and artists thought about how the aliens' construction would give them natural advantages and disadvantages.  And best of all, all the characters are well-developed, and many have fantastic personality changes and crises of faith, as well as cute quirks and great one-liners.  You have to see this movie!
B000066NW0|3.0|As with any new \\"young\\" artist, the debut album isn't any way to make any assumptions off of.  Every bit of effort is put into the album trying to make a multi-platinum hit record and the artist is usually out of material before the second album ever comes along.  I'm into hardcore metal, punk and underground rap, but every once in a while i give something new or different a shot and this was it.  The songwriting is a little better than what you'd expect from an artist her age (17, i think?), her vocals are exceptional, sometimes taking on an \\"alanis\\" type tone and the music covers everything from punk to folk to ballads.  \\"Sk8er Boi\\" is kiddie punk straight outta high school, but it's really catchy.  The first single \\"Complicated\\"  is ear candy for people into Michelle Branch type stuff.  My favorite cut would have to be \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" which mixes \\"white-teen-pop\\" raps with a female modern rock sounds that might be the best chance at a hit single on this set. Anyways, I've said enough, give this album a try!

B0000541AM|5.0|A city-wide truce has been called so that nine representatives of each of NY's thousands of warring street gangs can get to a kind of conference. In the claustrophobic precincts of a torch-lit park up in the Bronx at dead of night, the leader of NY's most powerful gang invites them to join together - an army of a hundred thousand soldiers - to take control of the city. At the height of his speech he is gunned down by a teenage psychopath who successfully pins the blame on The Warriors, a gang up from Coney Island. At that point the rally is broken up by riot police, and the Warriors have to make it the length of New York City back to their home turf through enemy-occupied territory. Not only are the police out in force to pick up stray gang-members; the successor to the assassinated leader has put a price on the Warriors' heads, and every gang in the city is combing the streets for them. <br />Walter Hill's 1979 movie was based on a very downbeat novel by Sol Yurick, which was itself loosely based on an ancient Greek legend about a group of soldiers fighting their way home across enemy territory. It may not sound a promising formula, but Walter Hill turned it into one of the most entertaining and uplifting films of its decade and perhaps of his career. His successful strategy was to turn his back on the depressing realism of the book. Although the basic story-line and setting are from Yurick's novel, Hill turned to the original Greek tale for the broader atmosphere and moral tone of the film. Whereas Yurick was essentially writing about the dehumanising effects of peer group pressure and dysfunctional family life, Hill made a film about mutual trust and teamwork under pressure. You may not approve of his heroes - they are innocent of the main crime they are accused of but probably guilty of almost everything else imaginable - but you can hardly fail to root for them as the whole of New York is out for their blood and they are forced to find strengths they would never have suspected they possessed. They don't all make it home, of course, but for those who do it's a story of growing up in one night. <br />This could have been just another street-fighting movie, but it was made with humour, sympathy and affection long before the genre was popularised by computer games and its conventions became cast in stone. Some of the gangs out to get the Warriors are just soulless thugs, but others are real people struggling with poverty, self-esteem and their sense of belonging. There is a certain amount of mostly well-choreographed violence, but it is all pretty cartoonish and violence is the last thing the film is really about. The real theme is group dynamics: who will take the lead, who will follow, who will rebel, who will be sacrificed, who will end up older and wiser. And if this sounds boring, remember that when the film was first released it sparked riots in NY theatres.<br />The film boasts some fine character performances by young actors who have since gone on to wider acclaim, notably James Remar and David Patrick Kelly. It is crammed with memorable lines and unforgettable visual images, and a special word is required on its inspired use of the New York Subway - moody, dark, mysterious, enticing, threatening, Freudian. The trains constantly rushing through, scarred with graffiti, coming from and going to nowhere, are often a means of advancing the story, but they are so much more than that: Stopping and starting without warning, sometimes in the nick of time, sometimes a moment too late, they are a metaphor for the uncontrollable and fickle world in which the characters live. And just as often they seem to symbolise the world outside the tiny living space of these alienated kids and beyond their reach. The stations and tunnels are sometimes a protective womb, sometimes a battleground. We see no drivers, no ticket clerks, or indeed any humanising faces apart from the threatening presence of police officers prowling back and forthlike monsters in a computer game - bump into one and you lose a life. <br />In the end Hill cannot resist moralising a little: The blossoming gotta-get-out-of-this-place romance between the alpha-male Swan and Mercy, a tough/fragile runaway girl who falls in with the gang initially just for kicks. The taut and delicately directed confrontation with a handful of \\"legitimate\\" middle-class passenger on the train. The despairing line (\\"Is this what we fought all night to get back to?\\") as the surviving members of the gang emerge from the night train onto the grimy elevated station at Coney Island, and survey their home turf in the cruel honesty of dawn's early light. These sentiments are not just slightly clumsy; they betray a mildly patronising middle-class pity on the film-makers' part for the characters they themselves created. But paradoxically, this very flaw contributes to the film's success. There has been no shortage of gritty real-life streetwise film-making, and the depressing earnestness of that sort of film can deter the very audience that most needs to be woken up by it. In contrast, this film that has been made purely for entertainment, with no cold sadistic violence, no prostitution and most remarkably of all no drugs, doesn't put up any barriers of revulsion. And it does not date, because the stylized cityscapes and costumes do not belong to any specific era. Thus it gets right under your skin and very subtly gives a transforming glimpse of the dark side of urban life and the humanity that we share with even its most exotic life-forms. That's probably why \\"The Warriors\\" sparked off riots on its first release, and perhaps that's why it seems to get even better with age.
B000060P79|5.0|as soon as you hear the pumped, energetic songs of simple plan, you can clearly perceive that all of the band members are dedicated and committed and just all-out psyched to be a part of the whole punk music scene.  they put an entirely original and exciting edge on this kind of music.  i would certainly recommend this album to any hardcore alternative/punk fan.  anyone who likes new found glory, ten foot pole, green day, riddlin kids, etc. would definitely and thoroughly enjoy \\"no pads, no helmets...just balls\\".  get [up], go out, and buy it for yourself or a friend, and hurry up!

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park was by far the best new band of 2001, with their first album Hybrid Theory.  Unlike some other bands, Linkin Park made this CD to be flawless, with, in my opinion, no low points.  Not many other bands can boast three hit singles (One Step Closer, Crawling, and In The End) from their first album.  Every song on this CD is worthy of being a top ten song in the nation upon its release.  This CD is not for wimps though, it is hard rock that sometimes verges on rap-rock and is sometimes categorized as metal.  These categories sometimes contain bands with songs that are blatantly offensive and could be a bad influence on kids, but Linkin Park finds a way to maintain their untamed, invigorating music that is great for getting pumped up for a game, while not swearing nearly as much as other bands that they are paralleled to, such as Limp Bizkit.  <BR>Now picture yourself getting ready for a big game or match: football, lacrosse, wrestling, etc. You have your Linkin Park CD playing, and you hear the lyrics &quot;now I'm one step closer to the edge, and I'm about to break!&quot; along with hard rock music and a DJ who enhances most songs on the album.  For me, this gets the blood flowing, and makes me want to get out there in the game and play my hardest right there and then.  I suggest buying this CD and trying this; you will be more excited to play for that game than you ever have been before! <BR>This CD is altogether a pleasure to listen to for anyone considering its purchase.  If you like the songs by Linkin Park that you hear on the radio, you will love this album, Hybrid Theory.
B00000I8UF|5.0|If you are interested in hearing the legacy of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, consider &quot;Moanin&quot; as an exceptional starting point. The title track alone ranks in the top 20 in terms of my all-time favorite compositions from any genre (and &quot;blues march&quot; isn't too far behind). The other compostions by saxist Benny Golson (&quot;are you real&quot; &quot;along came betty) also seem very strong. Finally, tunes like the &quot;drum thunder suite&quot; and &quot;blues march&quot; made me soon realize that great polyrhythmic, lyrical drumming began in the world of jazz (having been raised on rock and pop I mistakenly assumed that jazz drummers simply marked time) with greats like Blakey, Elvin Jones, Roy Haynes, and Tony Williams.<BR>Other great Blakey recordings to check out inlcude &quot;A Night In Tunisia&quot; and the Ken Burns Jazz compilation.
0553278223|4.0|This was the first Ray Bradbury novel that I have ever read and it definitely will not be my last. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a set of many short stories about the people of Earth landing on Mars and making a brand new civilization. All of the ideas that are in the stories are great and the stories can be broken down so you can identify themes that Ray Bradbury wanted the reader to learn. <br /> &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was written during the first half of the twenty first century and I'm sure that it is still a fascinating read today as it was when it first came out. Bradbury had all of the stories take place from 1999 all the way to 2026 and it is very interesting to notice how almost nothing that was in Bradbury's futuristic novel has happened thus far in the history of the world. <br /> Most of the stories of this book are very interesting and can be enjoyed whether you read one or two and read none for a while or whether you read the book from cover to cover, enjoying this book like it holds many fragments to what may be a future that can end up happening. The people that make the journey to Mars leave for a variety of reasons. People may be leaving Earth to start a new and better life, to get away from Earth and it's events, to escape being punished for a crime commited on Earth, or to get away from the atomic war that is predicted to happen on Earth. This book holds the stories to the people that make the journey to the red planet and the stories contain just fragments of their lives there. <br /> Bradbury brings forth many issues that may have been very important when the book was written but that are not very important to today's general population. Things that Bradbury brings forward are that one person in the book may find a certain thing okay but are not okay to someone else, human nature and man's want to own all and rule all, and other things such as love. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; is a very important novel for anybody toread. You don't only have to be a science fiction fan to appreciate the important things that this novel teaches. On top of teaching, however, this novel entertains greatly. I gave this novel four stars because I thought that there were a few mediocre stories, but these stories don't really detract from the overall enjoyment of the novel. This is a must read.<br />Happy Reading!
B00004T8RK|4.0|Through the years Pearl Jam has demonstrated they had put their personal likes ahead of the production of a comercial kind of album. &quot;Ten&quot; is indeed their best record.

B00003CXI1|1.0|Ugh, this movie takes everything away from Harry Potter! First of all, wasn't it \\"so exciting\\" that all these kids were reading instead of watching TV, and now they go and make a MOVIE. Oh yeah, that makes sense. Furthermore, I am not only disgusted that J.K. Rowling would let the book be made into a movie, but also that she would APPROVE of this one! It had very little of the plot in it, and the children were terrible actors. The one reason I had gone to see it was to watch the Quiddich, which was just plain awful! The people looked like SIMS! You know, from the computer game? All in all, a waste of time and money!
B000002KKD|5.0|Including in the New Wave movement as one of the principal forces we had this band from Athens, Georgia(the same as R.E.M.) wich is called for many years as \\"the best Party Band in the World\\". <BR> We are talkinabout their first release(1979) wich is, for the majority of their fans, their best work ever. And \\"The B-52's\\" is indeed a sublime work of creativity. Inspired in the alternative rock of the sixties and seventies, The B-52's appeared as \\"pop-freaks\\", using wigs, coloured clothes and, above all, creating an alternative form of making simple things sound great. <BR> As we can listen in this record, they were a diferent band who used lines like \\"here comes a bikini whale\\" in the classic \\"Rock Lobster\\", or \\"if you're lucky you get to ride in a gold meteorite\\" in the crazy-spacial track \\"There's a moon in the sky(called the Moon)\\". Other tunes are highlights like the great rock sound of \\"Lava\\" or the essential \\"Dance This Mess Around\\". And we have also in here a brilliant cover of the major hit \\"Downtown\\".  The whole album is genial. The B-52's began their career with their creativity peak. <BR> ESSENTIAL to everyone who enjoy good music, with a positive attitude. In my collection of 545 CD's this album is, of course, in my Top 20. <BR> Like The B-52's used to say \\"Its good to be diferent\\"...
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne's CD, &quot;Let Go&quot;, is a very good CD on it's own, and shows a lot of promise for what is to come in Lavigne's musical career. The riffs and music behind Lavigne's honest and forceful words makes this album a must have for any music listener who likes to just kick back, put on a CD, and relax. &quot;Let Go&quot; is also a CD that does not stick to one consistant musical flow, as the upbeat riffs behind Lavigne's &quot;Complicated&quot;, &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, and &quot;Losing Grip&quot; are complimented well by the slower, calmer music behind tracks such as &quot;I'm With You&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. All in all, \\"Let Go\\" is a very good CD that I'd suggest to anyone with an interest in pop/rock music.

B00005JKDR|5.0|As a family, we've seen Monsters, Inc. three times at the theaters.  My three-year-old sat through it all three times.  The characters are memorable, but not-too scary. The humor in this movie made my husband and I laugh right along with the kids. We've been waiting for the DVD release...I completely recommend this movie!
0590353403|4.0|Say you've spent the first 10 years of your life sleeping under the stairs of a family who hates you. Then, in a weird, magical way of luck, you find yourself surrounded by wizards, a caged snowy owl, a phoeniz-feath wand, and jellybeans that come in every flavor, including stawberry, curry, grass, and sardine. Not only that, but you find out that you are a wizard yourself! This is exactly what happens to Harry Potter in J.K Rowling's book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. In the nonmagic human world-- the world of \\"Muggles\\"-- Harry is a nobody, treated like dirt by the aunt and uncle who were made to take care of him when his parents were killed by the evil Voldemort. But in the world of wizards, Harry is famous as a survivor of the wizard who tried to kill him. He is left only with a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, and a bunch of powers to remind him that he's different from his aunt, uncle, and spoiled, piglike cousin Dudley. After watching the movie, I knew I had to read the book once more and write a review on it.<br />My favorite part of his book was the part when Harry Potter ahd to learn how to play Quidditch. He had to learn the basic rules of the game and how to play while balancing on a broomstick. He had to adjust to the game for it was his first time playing it. Even though his broom was jinxed, I would say he played a good game even thoguth the other team cheated and won. He learns the regulations of the game and is filled with knowledge on the game after playing it.<br />I think this book is great for everyone of every age to enjoy at any time. This book is for the whole family to enjoy. YOu can never predict what will happen next. There is always a cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, which is my favorite thing about a book. I believe taht J.K. Rowling is a wonderful author and has a bright future way ahead of her.
0553812173|4.0|While the story seems somewhat disjointed through the first half due to the myriad of protagonists, it all slowly gels and comes together for a fitting climax.<br />Some interesting ideas and characters. Gods and Mortals at play. Intriguing magic system and political machinations abound.<br />A little bit of everything in this book and well worth the read.

B000005AYM|5.0|A bit late on the reviews for this album having owned it for nigh on five years. Does it deliver? It was certainly new and refreshing back in '97 and it is still great listening today. One of the best albums of recent years and it just left you wanting more which she has delivered on Mamma's Gun her last release.<br />I could go on and review every track but I think everyone else has done a great job here and suffice to say I can't add any more superlatives. Essential listening and if you get the chance to see her live then take it.
B000066JES|5.0|Well, I just got my copy of Warriors of the world in the mail today and have spent the last couple of hours listening to it. To get right to the point, I havent enjoyed an album this much in quite awhile. As of this writing, there aren't any reviews posted yet, but I'm reasonably certain this album is going to elicit quite a bit of \\"what the hell was that??\\" from confused metalheads. This is one, strange album folks. When you first hold the jewel box in your sweaty, little hand, it looks exactly like every other Manowar cover they've ever done, no suprise there; but what waits for you on the disc itself was one heck of a suprise. Now, I have been a Manowar fan since Battle Hymns, and one thing Manowar doesn't do often is suprise you, which is partially why we love them I suppose, but man oh man I was not ready for this. The Opening track is a great, mid-tempo stomper that immediately sounds familiar to any Manowar fan. It's similar to \\"All men play on ten\\" and a great way to open the album, but here's where it gets weird folks...You will barely hear another heavy drum beat or power chord until the last 1/3 of the album. Yes, you didn't misread that. The next six tracks include a poignant ballad tribute to the heroes of the 9/11 tragedy, a mindblowing straight opera performance by Eric Adams of Puccini's aria Nessun Dorma, A sweeping epic \\"Masters of the wind\\" style ballad called \\"Valhalla\\", Another powerballad called \\"Swords in the Wind\\" which sounds exactly like you think it will, and..are you ready for this?..A medley of American folk songs including Dixie and Battle Hymn Of The Republic\\". This is followed by a synthesized classical fanfare dedicated in the liners to German composer Richard Wagner. Now, at this point, I'm sure alot of you rivetheads are saying to yourself..\\"heh heh, this sounds stupid Beavis..heh heh\\", but any true Manowar fan will know after the first few notes, that it all sounds exactly like Manowar. They have done something like this on almostevery album, but here there's more of it. Now, here's the good news for those of you who are cringing right now, the last 4 tracks are without a doubt the heaviest thing they have ever done, by a longshot. \\"Hand Of Doom\\", \\"House of Death\\", and \\"Fight until We Die\\", are fast thrashy windsheild crackers of the first order. Similar to the fast tracks on \\"Triumph Of Steel\\", but with a heavier, much thicker guitar tone (something they always needed IMO). Now obviously this is all a matter of taste, but I personally loved this album so much, I played 3 times in a row just to make sure I heard what I thought I did. Let me just say this, if you are not scraping your jaw off the carpet after hearing Eric Adams on Nessun Dorma, and running to your friend who thinks that Geoff Tate is the world's greatest metal singer's house, then you have no business owning a stereo. This album was the first time Manowar ever really suprised me, but they did it big. If this ends up being their last album, they went out with a bang.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a great album.  A bit rough lyrically in spots, but it only adds to the charm and the ability to feel on the same level as the artist.  Tracks like &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;Unwanted&quot; show a bit more rocking side to her personality, while &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; prove she is a fresh new artist with a range of ability and an even broader range of emotion to draw from.
B000002MT0|4.0|The year was 1993. Prince (as he was still known early in the year) had released his 3 CD THE HITS/B-SIDES collection, documenting a lifetime's worth of great music that really only represented 15 years. The collection was Prince's way of bidding farewell to his past before beginning a new stage of his life & career, which started by changing his name to an unpronouncable symbol. This part of Prince's career is often given a cold shoulder, many people saying he was far past his prime by now & was simply doing it to get people's attention. Shortly after the name change, he released one last album under his old name, 1994's COME.<br />No doubt about it, 1980's DIRTY MIND was probably the darkest album of Prince's career. The infamous BLACK ALBUM might even outdo that one, but seeing as how it was never officially released, it must be taken out of the running. COME, on the other hand, overtakes DIRTY MIND's darkness many times over. While it certainly doesn't even approach DIRTY MIND's genius (by the 1990s, there weren't that many more barriers to be broken), COME still is a rather good late-period Prince work in its own way.<br />The album is definitely as stripped-down as DIRTY MIND or BLACK, right down to the one-word titles of the songs. The opening title track is a 10-minute-long jam where discovering the meaning of the song is no mystery at all. Definitely a song made for getting out on the dance floor & forgetting your troubles, not for close listening. \\"Space\\" continues the danceable groove with a more pronounced jazz sound (echoes of THE RAINBOW CHILDREN album of late). \\"Pheromone\\" is another unabashed sexual come-on that doesn't really register; in fact, one critic probably described it accurately as a \\"fair moan\\". \\"Loose!\\" brings things back up to dance level, while \\"Papa\\" is a frightening look at abuse that also predates THE RAINBOW CHILDREN with Prince's deeper voice. My guess is that this may be another outtake from the BLACK ALBUM.<br />The second half is the album at its darkest. \\"Race\\" is a dose of acid-jazz that takes on its titular subject with appropriate seriousness. \\"Dark\\" is just that, an R&B love song with no apparent light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Solo\\" is another song that doesn't measure up, but it contains what might be Prince's best vocal performance on the album. \\"Letitgo\\" was the album's only hit single & no surprise, it's really the only one people (and radio, for that matter) could digest. A deceptively upbeat pop song with a killer flute line, it would turn out to be Prince's last hit single under his old name. An appropriate end to what many people consider to be Prince's only real career. The closing \\"Orgasm\\" is pretty self-explanatory, much like DIRTY MIND's \\"Head\\".<br />For sure, COME has sex written all over it. But the prevailing atmosphere is of a darker hue, indicating maybe Prince was trying to create another DIRTY MIND & of course not quite succeeding (why would one even try?). In sight of Prince's mammoth, beyond-description career, COME is really just a footnote. But it is rather important as Prince's goodbye to a part of him that we would not return to for the better part of a decade (if you can call THE RAINBOW CHILDREN a return at all). Yes, his \\"symboled\\" work may be several steps down from his best & time has not yet been kind to it, but COME is a good way to witness Prince at the end of one stage of his career & one the threshold of another, even more idiosyncratic one. If you can accept the album's darkness, feel free to COME along with Prince on this journey through his subconscious.s the album at its darkest. \\"Race\\" is a dose of acid-jazz that takes on its titular subject with appropriate seriousness. \\"Dark\\" is just that, an R&B love song with no apparent light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Solo\\" is another song that doesn't measure up, but it contains what might be Prince's best vocal performance on the album. \\"Letitgo\\" was the album's only hit single & no surprise, it's really the only one people (and radio, for that matter) could digest.

B000066NW0|4.0|This might make me sound like a dork, but even though i'm a guy, i really enjoy chick rock a great deal.  This album gets the formula right, without falling into the classic rock cliches.  While it lacks the depth of lyrics of some of the recent releases from other female artists, it still contains a great deal of pep and energy, which contributes greatly to the enjoyment of the album. It gets off to a rocking start with \\"Losing Grip\\" and doesn't stop until the end. Avril will definitely benefit from more life experience and more practice at songwriting.  That said, this is still a very strong start.  I recommend this to album to anyone who is a fan of the likes of Michelle Branch, Vanessa Carlton, or Heather Nova.  A very enjoyable experience indeed...
B00000JHAU|5.0|I've only listened to half of my new Belle and Sebastian CD, but I already love it.  It's so beautiful.  What a green, glowing, mystical feeling you get when you listen to 'If You're Feeling Sinister'!  It's like you're running through vibrant green grass and into this forest of dark olive and viridian colored trees and it's sunny, and everything is glowing.  You're barefoot and your hair is flying wild.  Everywhere you turn, the view is glazed by some warm color - green, red, orange, purple...I love it.
1587990717|1.0|Like most every reviewer here, I thought his proposed thesis would make an interesting book, and it was on that basis that I bought and read this. Unfortunately, all I got was about 200 pages of self-satisfied ignorance regarding contemporary culture, with the occassional generalization about the role of randomness in the market and life.<br />As somebody with a PhD in philosophy who wrote his dis in Phil of Science, I was especially teed off by the ease which he mocks all theorists except Popper. Going purely by what he's written here, his argument against the entire continental tradition from at least Hegel to the present, is based on the fact that they are difficult to understand. For most, this would not be something to brag about, but for Nero Tulip there is nothing that does not fall into that category.
B000002H2H|5.0|...<br />For Metallica, that album has always been (by the fans of course) Master of Puppets.  And while I indeed share the praise of the MOP worshippers, I cannot really believe it is the flawless masterpiece that is regarded as, nor is it even Metallica's greatest album, in my opinion.  In said opinion, that album is, and always has been, Ride The Lightning.  <br />I believe this album truly gives a stellar and energetic Metallica perormance unlike any other, along with unsurpassed musicianship.  Few albums can really be this fast or heavy and yet this technical.  This is Metallica's fastest, heaviest, (even the MOP idolizers should agree to that) and really most power packed collection of songs they've ever released.<br />Even in a song-by-song comparison MOP can't really stand up.  \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" is possibly the greatest song ever, easily surpassing \\"Battery.\\"  True, in terms of title tracks, Master of Puppets easily beats out ride the lightning, but really only in that category.  \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is leaps and bounds ahead of \\"The Thing That Should Not Be,\\" and \\"Fade to Black is probably Metallica's best ballad ever, once again far better than \\"Sanitarium.\\"  Istrumental-wise \\"Call of Ktulu\\" over \\"Orion\\" anyday, and the rest of the album as well.  Don't take this as Master-bashing, but I really can't see how it can stand up here.  Oh well, as mentioned, it IS just my opinion, and I needed to share it, but maybe now that I have, some of the RTL-supporters will take up my cause for the true \\"classic albums.\\"
B000001ELL|5.0|When this one was put out, Disco was the &quot;in&quot; thing and KISS adapted to the trend by putting out some songs a person could dance to as well as get off too. Is this to say that KISS went disco??? No, not totally. What actually happened was that KISS used their genius to put out music that would not take away from their image of being Rock and Rollers, yet, at the same time would make people want to dance to their music. In other words if you think KISS is going to sound like KC And The Sunshine Band on this CD, you're dead wrong. There are no horns, and no keyboards, just good rock and roll you can dance by. The one song that really takes the cake is Charisma. On it, Gene sings in his deepest voice, a voice that near the end of the song, can send chills up your spine. He literally sounds like a Demon from the depths of hell. Another great aspect of this CD is getting to hear more of the vocal talents of Ace Frehley on songs like 2,000 Man, Save Your Love, and Hard Times. The song &quot;I Was Made For Lovin You&quot; was the most popular song on the CD and made it into the top 20 on Billboard's Singles Chart. Catman86 Review is good to check out also.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this movie!  It's a beautiful film, and I only wish I had been able to see it while it was in thaters.  Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are brilliant actors and singers.  Jim Broadbent is amazing, portraying the entire range of emotions with incredible skill.  Richard Roxburgh is hilarious, and deeply frightening.  Every actor in this film is good.  I hope we'll see more from our unconscious Argentinean friend, Jacek Koman (who is actually Polish!!).  The sights and sounds in this movie range from blatantly gorgeous to sweetly subtle.  It gives you more emotion than you've ever thought about going through in a few hours.<br />Also, the DVD extras are absolutely amazing.  You'll spend hours playing with the extras, and hunting for &quot;easter eggs&quot;.  The Easter eggs are great!  I also like the &quot;Behind the Red Curtain&quot; feature.  It has some great commentary by Baz and Catherine Martin, and some interesting footage.  All-in-all, the best DVD I've ever played with... granted, I haven't seen many, but this one has kept me entertained for days!!<br />Like many have said.. it's a love it or hate it movie.  There's no in-between.  I hope YOU love it!!
B000003S2M|3.0|Some proclaimed Ambient 3 to be the most boring album in the ambient series but seriously Ambient 2 is the most unexciting.<br />Ambient 2 is just a remake of Ambeint 1 except now the tracks are shorter and more textured and seems more New age like. But the techniques are nothing to scream about ... unlike the rest of the ambient series which prop the listeners to challendge them to listen to music in a different way ... Ambient 2 is just the same givena refinement ... but still all fan of the series should complete their series just do not expect this to excite but instead treat this album as an extension from Ambient 1
0385484518|5.0|A friend recommended this book when I was feeling low.<BR>This book is a rebel against the norms of life as we know it, and reminds us there is a world bigger than our own.<BR>This is the book of life - to cast our fears and live our lives to the fullest.<BR>A book so simple, yet so memorable.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Some people say that 'Kiss me..' is too long and that it would have been better to cut off some songs to make it a fabulous shorter record, well I don't agree. I adore The Cure and every song in 'Kiss me..' is worth a listen, and a good one. Songs like 'Just Like Heaven' and 'Why Can't I Be You?' made them famous around the world. I prefer 'Disintegration', but for songs like 'Catch', 'If Only Tonight We Could Sleep', 'How Beautiful You Are' and 'The Snakepit', it's worth every penny. I'm sure that there is material on there to please everybody.
6305508550|5.0|\\"Office Space\\" is, quite suprisingly, one of the top 3 comedies of the last 20 years in my opinion. It ranks right up with \\"Ghostbusters\\" and \\"Back to the Future\\", but is a completely different type of movie.<br />It is frankly brilliant. It's humor lies in the satirical realism in its portrayal of white-collar borgeois ennui (I was dying to use those words). Peter Gibbons is you and I: a bored and frustrated cubical drone who is surrounded by the most insane yet realistic office envoronment ever shown on film. Every office has these workers in it:<br />1. The annoying phone-answering voice person. (Mina in Corporate Accounts Payable)<br />2. The total nerd who thinks he's a tough-guy. (Michael \\"Mike\\" Bolton, look at his gangsta rap and Navy Seals posters in his cube)<br />3. The annoying younger guy who is a sexual harassment case waiting to happen. (Drew, the \\"oh\\" face guy)<br />4. The annoying older person who is eternally convinced they're going to get laid off (Tom Smigmikowski, the \\"Jump to Conclusions\\" guy).<br />5. The easily irritable engineer type guy who can't figure out the copier / fax machine (Samir Naninagaja)<br />6. The disgustingly happy and content person. (The \\"case of the Mondays\\" mail lady)<br />7. The snide, \\"method management\\" boss who speaks to everyone like they're in 5th grade. (Lumberg)<br />and of course...<br />8. The twitchy postal case (Milton)<br />All of these characters are people we know in our everyday dealings at work. That, combined with the cubical-farm of an office building that is Initech (direct competitor with Penetrode and Initrode) make this film almost frightening. The office is laden with Swingline staplers, walls adorned with lame \\"Employee of the Month\\" plaques, and ceilings with motivating corporate slogans like \\"Is this good for THE COMPANY???\\" We have all worked here before!!<br />The humor is subtle and not at all goofy or in-your-face. Some may not find it as funny (probably corporate stuffed shirts and managerslike Bill Lumberg) as those type of films,  but this is an intellegent and hysterical comedy nonetheless. Ron Livingston is a great actor who is just now becoming recognized after his role on \\"The Pracice\\" and in HBO's \\"Band of Brothers\\". He plays another great roll in the direct to video \\"Body Shots\\". The guy who plays Lumberg was also Mike Brady from the \\"Brady Bunch\\" movies and he is also brilliant. <br />Check this out quick before you get laid off or downsized!!
B000006TRV|3.0|I dunno. Everyone is soo crasy about this album. Really, in my humble opinion, this is the album in which the floyd lost it`s real sound. But that`s my third topic:<br />Topic 1 - Commercial success: Allright. We all know the \\"another brick in the wall being a great commercial succes\\" event. But, was that really worth it?. This album is vey commercial-oriented, i`ll take a risk and say that the only thing that keeps this album within the progressive feel is the songs distribution and one or two way too long instrumentals... I honestly think that you could resume the wall into 1 \\"rock pop hits\\" album: In the flesh, Another brick in the wall, Mother, Young lust, Hey You, Run like Hell, comfortably numb.. and a couple more...What happened to the Floyd???. That leads me to my second point:<br />Topic 2- Roger Ego Inflation: Let`s face it. Mr. Waters was kind of the leader in the Floyd. But, the best floyd albums are the ones in which EVERY MEMBER of PF contributed with their ideas(except for \\"The piper...\\"), music, & structure: Wish u were, Dark Side, Meddle, Atom Mother. They have all the real floyd feel, and all PF were there, making music. Mr. Waters overinflated ego (maybe) caused this whole thing. I think he`s a real genius (the lyrics department, come on!!!), but... The final cut was a really dissapointing album, really, and was all him. The wall is a good album, really, but Pink Floyed always worked better as Pink Floyd. Then he kicked out Rick Wright. Come on!!!!!!, where is \\"summer of 68\\", \\"the great gig\\", not telling his collaboration in a LOT of songs. I kind of resent this attitude of roger. He wanted a new direction, so he took the band to this change of sound... I dunno. Also, and as and important issue, \\"The Wall\\" is a very dissorganised album!!!, one minute songs, dull interludes... The singles really make an equilibrium, but, as I said, they could`ve formed a single cd.<br />Topic 3- Loss of Floyd Sound: Where is the atmospheric sound!!!!!????, WHERE , WHERE, please????, where are the powerful keyboards, the electronic sound, the epic arrangements, where???. Almost a total loss of the Floyd sound. Really a shame, really.<br />Overall: This IS a good album, but DEFINETLY not the best. Overrated by everybody, exhaltated as an anthem, the movie becoming a cult movie (the movie realy sucked), The Wall ranks alongside that great amount of records of some bands, that  are real good but does not make you remind of the band good times. This of course, being the modest opinion of a HUGE Pink Floyd fanatic. I hope this was useful for you, really.WHERE, please????, where are the powerful keyboards, the electronic sound, the epic arrangements, where???. Almost a total loss of the Floyd sound.

B00006690F|5.0|The Eminem Show has to be Eminem's best CD yet. You won't have to push the skip button once. All of the songs are amazing..no bad songs. After the Marshall Mathers LP it seemed impossible to get any better, but he just keeps becoming more and more talented. Em can't leave alone the game needs him. I think when he does leave, he'll be the best ever. Get this CD.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I just watched the film last night and I am still speechless.
0312979479|5.0|This is the first Agatha Christie book I've read and since then I've been a fan of hers. I was in grade 8 and our homework was to read this book. Like many other reviewers here I finished it in a day or even in a couple of hours as I was so into it.<br />I've read a lot of her books ever since, all excellent and original, but none impressed me like this one did. It's almost impossible to discover the murderer, and that what makes it even more thrilling. Read it if you haven't, you certainly won't regret it!!
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|This movie was boarderline unwatchable. I'm not one of those people who thinks that stupid equates to funny. I never laughed once at this movie, except maybe when the masked guy calls and says \\"whassup!?!\\", but I saw that in the ads anyway. <br />This isn't the case of people not liking a movie becase it was \\"too cutting edge\\" or some stupid [stuff] like that. I laughed myself silly at \\"Something About Mary\\", \\"Road Trip\\", and the \\"American Pie\\" movies. I love \\"Airplane!\\" and those other spoofs. But this was not funny! This was just useless [junk]. It was exactly what a couple of 14 year old kids would write if they were ever given the opportunity to write a movie. <br />It takes a tremendous ammount of talent and intellegence to make a funny \\"stupid\\" movie. This is NOT one of those movies. It tries to make up for it's shorcomings by being shocking and gross. It fails miserably, however. It's gross just for the sake of being gross. There's no humor at all in anything that happens. This is the height of useless, gratuitous, garbage. I feel like I wasted 2 prescious hours of my life watching this. Please don't make the same mistake I did.
B00002SWEM|5.0|To say that this movie is a musical experience would be to distract from the fantastic footage of Cuba and some outstanding music and the persons performing.  This is not a 'Vegas' or a hollywood glitzy production.  These are not sounds of phoney... over paid, over pampered spoiled &quot;hit parade&quot; artists that we see on our video channels.  This is MUSIC ... music that you can feel, very ordinary people in an impoverished country singing with heart.  Oh what wonderful sounds, sights and sound produced by extremely talented but humble persons.  Outside and/or inside these are not stars ... headliners but ooh the talent. This is a movie that every household should consider as a must and should become a classic.
0694524786|5.0|I read the whole series as a child and LOVED it.  But I bought the CD to \\"reread\\" it and I enjoyed it even more.  I heard things that I had not read before.  Listening made this book come alive as never before.  I highly recommend it!!!  Wonderful for both children and adults alike...
B0039208JE|5.0|Gotham City is about to celebrate it's 200th anniversary, a shadowy figure named Batman (Michael Keaton) has been taken a bite out of crime leaving the police baffled. However, during the day he is a mild mannered millionaire playboy named Bruce Wayne who was traumatized by his parent's death years ago when he was a kid and raised by his butler Alfred (Michael Gough) as he vows to fight crime by becoming an avenger. An insidious criminal named Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson) was recently thrown into a vat of chemicals by Batman as he becomes a white skinned clown-like figure named Joker who seeks revenge on the city and seeks the heart of a lovely photographer named Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger).<br /><br />One of the best comic book movies of all time and a unique classic to this day. Since 1979 after the success of Warner Brother's adaptation of \\"Superman\\" they've been trying to make Batman into a movie which was in development hell for over a decade. However after \\"Superman 4 The Quest for Peace\\" was the nail in the coffin for the Superman franchise, DC and Warner decided to make the Batman movie and hired Tim Burton after the success of \\"Beetlejuice\\" and how he was impressed by Alan Moore's \\"killing Joke\\" which was a big influence on this movie. Unlike the campy yet cool and fun 1960's Batman, this movie was designed to bring Batman back to his dark roots like Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Year One did and Burton with company succeeded on film. Co-starring Pat Hingle, Jack Palance, Robert Wuhl and Billy Dee Williams this epic superhero action fantasy has brilliant visuals by Anton Furst and a dazzling soundtrack by both Danny Elfman and Prince.<br /><br />Michael Keaton was a controversial choice to play Batman but it silenced the fans, there was alot of hype before the movie came out as in December 88 with that teaser appeared as it made everyone crazy for Batman and Jack Nicholson was very good as the Joker as much as Mark Hamil, Heath Ledger and Caesar Romero were. Then in 1989 merchandise was made from t-shirts. food products, toys, cards, magazines, cereal, books etc. as it was the year of the bat and the film opened on June 23rd that year to become the highest grossing movie of the year and one of the biggest box-office hits of all time including critical acclaim. I remembered when i was 8 seeing this in theaters, i loved it and became a Batman fan as i had the merchandise including soundtrack to even comics as it turned almost any 80's kid into a Batman fan as i even watched that campy 60's show on Family Channel as well. The movie spawned one great sequel, one decent sequel and one terrible sequel, an awesome animated series, a fantastic reboot series and many fans of Batman to come.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers quality picture despite a few instances of grain while the sound quality is very nice and the extras are great such as audio commentary by Tim Burton, Legends of The Dark Knight: The History of Batman featurette, Shadows of the Batman The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight parts 1 to 3 documentary, Beyond Batman Documentary gallery, 3 Prince music videos, Heroes and villains profile galleries, Batman The Complete Robin storyboard sequence and trailer..

B000002H70|5.0|The Cure is my favourite band, and although I love all of their albums, this one has something special. Robert Smith at his best, with majestic lyrics (as always), and the melodies are so beautiful it's just out of this world. I would suggest this album to everybody, to me it is pure beauty and certainly one of the best album of the 80's.
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is a moving, deeply intimate story about the human struggle for achieving one's dreams. It is with a combination of brilliant acting by all the principles, a subtle yet powerful script, great direction, and a perfectly matched soundtrack that causes the film to come across as masterfully as it does.<br />What makes Gattaca so different is it's ability to achieve that &quot;reach for your dreams&quot; theme without being corny or contrived. While I always love inspirational movies about the power of the human spirit, &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;Rudy&quot; are just too in-your-face to actually effect the viewer on a deep level.<br />This is the first movie since &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; that has the intimacy and subtlety to pull it off and make the viewer really FEEL the story. Hawke is outstanding as the principle character, a genetically imperfect man trying to overcome the limits placed on him in a futuristic caste society. Jude Law is equally amazing as the man who sacrifices everythig for the chance to feel alive again and ultimately help Hawke reach his dream. The landscapes and sets are all excellently matched to the spartan, utilitarian, and genetically &quot;clean&quot; future world we are swept to. It is quite simply masterful on all levels.
B0000057C5|5.0|My friend was the first person who told me about this music. He gets music off the internet, but I bought the CD because the internet only contains quality copies of the favored songs. I, personally, think they are all great in one way or another. I have been a fan of J-Pop, so I thought I would look into something else. This CD goes along great with my other rock bands, and comes in handy when playing fast-paced games. However, it may take you a while to get used to their music. I could only listen to a few songs at first, but eventually, I got used to it. It goes good with all that gunfire in my game background. :) Anyhow, Rammstein is heavier than most rock bands I listen to, and his voice reminds me of a a German general. I don't really care what all they're saying, it just sounds cool.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an absolute joy! I loved every song the minute I heard them. Nice soft &quot;jazz&quot; feel, but versatile style. (Lonestar). A soothing, enjoyable, well-composed and well-executed sound.  I hope there will be more to come from this very talented artist.
B00001OH7O|5.0|I like David Bowie and this is the album that got me into music. I was about 5 years old when my cousin (who's a Bowie fanatic) played that record over and over again. Years later I listened to it again and songs like 'Life On Mars?', 'Quicksand', 'Andy Warhol' and 'The Bewlay Brothers' brought back great memories and are as great as ever. I've heard his other material and I like it, especially 'Ziggy Stardust' and 'Station to Station', but 'Hunky Dory' remains for me an absolute gem!
0440224764|3.0|Imagine waking up to the same routine everyday.  Jogging eight miles, having a beautiful girlfriend.  Where you have millions invested in the banks.  What if all of this was just an escape from a previous life.  For Danilo Salvio or also known as Patrick Lanigan.  He had a beautiful wife, a newborn, and worked for a well-respected law firm, back in his home in Biloxi Mississippi.  Patrick found out a secret about the firm.  That began his patient and brilliant plan to disappear with millions from his firm.  Leaving behind his family and friends.  A couple of years after Patrick disappeared his law firm put together what happened.  Jack Stephano was hired to find Patrick and the stolen money.  After many twists and turns , he found him a little house in Brazil.  Nearly tortured Patrick to death and turned back over to the government.  The Government had charged Patrick with many charges including manslaughter.  Patrick had a plan.  Hopefully it is good enough...
B00001ODHJ|5.0|How could you not like this film? Even if you did not see the first two movies the film explains it self in the first five minutes anyway. this is the all time great cult film. Ash(Bruce Campbell) is a great hero. He's both a genius and an idiot. He can make gun powder from his 11th grade science book (which he keeps in his trunk) but he can't seem to remember three little words. and he has so many great lines in this movie.\\"Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.\\" If your going to complain about the historical inaccuracies of the cheesy special effects the don't watch this film. your most likely a film snob and won't be happy with anything anyway. but if you want to see a really outragious film then then I suggest you see this flick.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is definitely a great album......Although Avril Lavigne has often been criticised for her 'dull' lyrics, this is something you don't pay much attention to on her debut album, because it is packed with great, catchy tunes that make up for them....Basically Let Go is a wonderful feel-good album and a blast to listen to....It rocks! And those ballads 'I'm With You' and 'Tomorrow' are heaven.....
B0000032LS|5.0|When I first saw the movie some years ago I fell in love with it and I understand perfectly how it became the cult movie that it is now. This soundtrack is perfect for those who liked the movie, and for those who still haven't seen it, listen to this and I'm sure you'll rent the movie straight after! It's funny and very original. Great soundtrack, a must have!
B00005JKL8|4.0|After having seen a ton of war movies in the past few years, I went into \\"Behind Enemy Lines\\" with very few expectations. However, to my surprise, the movie was thrilling from start to finish! The feeling of desperation and fear behind enemy lines is felt throughout the whole escapade, and the movie launches from one scene to the next with hardly time for the viewer to catch his breath. Owen Wilson, who produced arguably mixed performances in laughable movies (pun unintended) such as Shanghai Noon and Zoolander, actually does a credible job delivering the pulsating action right to your doorstep. You truly feel for him, and any attempts to empathize with his plight only serve to intensify the fear. Director John Moore is on top form, and cleverly uses Gene Hackman as a mirror to illustrate the war that is concurrently taking place within the confines of the political arena. Hackman, who is superb as Wilson's commanding officer, exposes the true irony of the society that we live in. Many a time, as we have seen throughout history, mankind will typically do what is best for their own selfish cause, rather than what is necessary to preserve human life and ensure justice. In their attempt at justification, the powers-that-would-be claim that the needs of one should be sacrificed for the needs of many. This is none more so apparent than when politics is concerned, and Hackman constantly wages a moral battle between disobeying direct orders and sacrificing a man's life.<br />While the action sequences, populated with spectacular explosions, are both stunning and enjoyable, hard-nosed critics will still be able to find minor faults with the movie. But as a viewer with pure entertainment in mind, the intense action and gripping drama make this one movie not to be missed!
B00004U3UG|4.0|Unless you're a hard core Evil Dead fan- You probably won't be incredibly interested in the directors cut version of Army of Darkness.  There's fifteen minutes of bonus footage including an alternate ending but most of the added footage doesn't seem to be as glossed over to fit the rest of the movie.  The picture doesn't seem as crisp and the sound quality isn't as good.  Although enjoyable I prefer the original version to this one.
B00005R2M3|4.0|I think that this cd is very very great...in my country ECUADOR shakira is a famous singer since 1995, her fist single debut in Latinoamrica was &quot;Donde ests corazn&quot; from the albun &quot;Pies descalzos&quot;, it was #1 in Ecuador, after she backed in 1998 with &quot;Ciega, sordomuda&quot;,&quot;Inevitable&quot; and the best song of this album &quot;Ojos as&quot;......the new album of the colombian sensation is nice...the best of shakira is that writes and produces the lyrics and music of all the album and thats is important....but I think that can pronunce better her english with the next album....The best song of this album is &quot;Suerte/Whenever wherever&quot; because in this song she introduces the Andess rhythm and she doesnt forget her culture....is for all that that it song was #1 in all Europe, Latin amrica, Australia, and Asia.....Great CD....
B00000AFFI|5.0|I adore and admire PJ Harvey. She is such a great singer, very emotional and passionate. I own all of her albums, but this one is particular. Each song is wonderful and unique. Songs like 'Catherine', 'My Beautiful Leah' and 'The River' are amazing! 'Is This Desire?' is definitely a superb album.
0792841344|5.0|What do I say. Saw it as a kid (30 now) spent years trying to find out what the name of it was, now I have it and it's 3 companions. COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.....I'm salivating over this new edition. Just ordered it. If it's anywhere as good as the movie itself I'll probably wear it out like I did my VHS copy....<br />TO sum up - The best 13 bucks you'll ever spend....

067144901X|5.0|This is my absolute favorite book for very young children. We're currently buying a couple of new copies. Our original copy is battered and torn and taped back together from my oldest child (now five). Or, I should say, it WAS. It's currently in pieces since our toddler got his pudgy little hands on it.<br />I never get tired of reading this book, which is fortunate since my children never get tired of hearing it. Even my five year old still loves to hear this book. In fact, he has it memorized now, so he \\"reads\\" it to his little brother.<br />We love all the Sandra Boynton books, but this is our all time favorite.
B00005O5JV|3.0|I really didn't know what to expect of this when I rented it, but being the deranged movie maniac I am (in the nicest possible way) I plunked down a whole NZ$3 (which is probably something like 30c US) and took the durn thing home, grabbed a nice cold beer and slammed it into my VCR. For a while, my friends; it was heavy going: giggly dopey airheads saying &quot;like&quot; endlessly. But I persevered.... and things got better. Sure, the ending is so stupid and unlikely that you will be rolling your eyeballs toward the heavens, but this story of a blonde bimbo who becomes a lawyer to prove to her ex-boyfriend there's more to her than being blonde and having a body you could eat off, is actually quite likeable, in large part to Reese Witherspoon's performance (plus she looks really hot in a bikini too).
068484267X|5.0|I chose this book because,I have seen the movie and I wanted to know what the book was like.This book is about a young irish boy named Frank Mcourt who was born in New York in the 1920's with his two irish- immagrant parents and little brother Malachy jr.He moved back to limereck ireland whe he was four.His mother's side of the family really dislike his father, because he is from Northern Ireland and has a funny manner also because he dosn't take care of his family.you might think that's not fair, but the father isn't very caring. whenever he gets paid money from his job, he goes to bars and spends all his money getting drunk, while his wife and children are starving and go to bed hungry.frank and his family are very poor and can hardley pay for catholic school.this story is very sad and helps you appreciate what you have. This story is true and the author is the little boy, Frank Mcourt, which this story is about.I enjoyed reading this book.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|Will Smith did well. His portrayal of Ali is all this film had to lean on, the storyline was weak and drawn. I'd suggest renting it once, not buying it.

0140186395|5.0|East of Eden is truly a novel of unfound proportions. It plays on the juxtaposition of naivety and wisdom, truth and faith, struggle and redemption, and most importantly, good and evil. Within the given boundaries of 600 pages, Steinbeck explores the psychological and mental desires of everybody, while also enlightening the readers with a theory on the purpose of life and its attributes.<br />The main storyline follows the vicious cycle of two generations of siblings in the Trask family, while also playing on the biblical reference to the stories of Cain and Abel, and Caleb and Aron. The two set of brothers, who set the stage for the novel, are always in conflict with one another in their desire to gain the love of their fathers. In its exploration of their interaction with the people around them and with their fathers, Steinbeck uses the brothers in order to explain life as the Bible does. He directly calls upon the stories in the vastly popular book in order to expound on God's meaning of life as it pertains to society and how people should view their lives in respect to others. He creates a whole commonalty of characters that help extenuate and expose the interactions of people and their effects. Cathy, another important figure in the book, is Steinbeck's way of placing evil in a light that takes a tangible form. Cathy is one character alone that while she amazes and builds suspense for the reader, she also disgusts and shocks the reader with her cunning ability to manipulate people at the lift of a finger. Her evil genius is solely a product of her desires: to get out of work in dismissing responsibility, to subjugate blame, and gain an enormous control over people. Steinbeck also delves into the meaning of life and how it is defined completely on the ability of choice. He acquaints the readers with the word \\"timshel.\\" Etymologically speaking, the Hebrew word directly translates to \\"thou mayest,\\" which Steinbeck uses to express his viewpoint on choice. He tellsthe reader that only he has the ability to choose the path of his life, and it is he who can conquer sin and break from past trends. <br />Ultimately, the book brings out the true battle of good and evil as the Bible interprets it, and reveals the true definition of life. As Steinbeck explores the issues that surround life in terms of faith, trust, and love, he creates an unbelievable book, despite its licentiousness, that leaps out of the boundaries delineated by society. The characters, the themes, the story itself, all of it comes together, creating a momentous book by all standards.
0783117388|3.0|I think \\"Sex & The City\\" has gotten better since the first season, but it was a reasonably good beginning.  The characters are a little slow to develop into real individuals here, and there are a few too many \\"person on the street\\" type quotes cut in, especially in the first couple of episodes, but by the end of the season, Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte, and Samantha are fully-drawn (if by definition somewhat charicatured).  <br />This is reliably entertaining and occasionally very funny viewing, and can be particularly fun to watch with friends, providing good opportunities to share your own stories with each other as the situations the characters find themselves in remind you of similar situations in your own lives.  Very few of us live like these four women, of course, but there can still be points in common.  Obnoxious men, after all, are not limited to New York.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's CD is so off the hook it is incredible.  It is a great cd for teenagers!  The song &quot;Perfect&quot; tells how every teenager feels that they are not good enough for their parents.  Ever since i got the CD it is all i listen to and i never get sick of it.  &quot;Just A Kid&quot; is an awesome song and it once again tells how teenagers feel.  It is pure punk and pure awesome.  &quot;I'd do Anything&quot; features Mark Hoppus which is totally cool!  This CD rocks and i highly recommend it!
B00005V1Z5|5.0|This is a genius film!  Ben Stiller's other directing projects were just as well conceived, (especially 1996's under-rated \\"The Cable Guy\\")but this one takes the cake.  For those of you who thought it was the worst thing you've ever seen, you're thinking too hard.  I'll take the hilarious offbeat humour of this masterpiece any day over the overly-pretentious, ADD-induced, first forty minutes of Moulin Rouge (And I'm sure that 90% of the reviewers who hated this film, loved Moulin Rouge).  Trust me, watch this one again.  You should be thanking comedians like Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell for indulging in their own risky, offbeat humour, that cares little what critics think and, instead, comes from their brilliant, original comedic whims.  At least these guys have the [stuff] to put what THEY think is funny in a movie, not what the MASS PUBLIC will think is funny (because most of the time--Scary Movie, American Pie 2, Saving Silverman being perfect examples--it isn't).  Five Stars.
B00004Z4WQ|3.0|This is a movie that spoofs the nonsense in other movies, specifically I Know What you did Last Summer. I havent seen Scream or I Know... but the references are unmistakably funny.<br />The humor is downright sexist and crude, but its really hilarious when compared with the original movie. The scenes where the case is told that 'someone knows' is downright crude and rubbish... and is hilarious in the creativity of the story writers. The opening sequence is another classic in spoofing. This movie is made on the lines of Mad comix, so if you like the humor there, you will enjoy this.<br />Best seen with a group of friends, preferably male, and to be seen after seeing I Know... and Scream. Ideal for a weekend of nonsense and chilling at home!
6300214370|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  The music in this movie was fantastic and fit just right into every aspect of the movie.  I could see this actually happening in a little town like Beaumont and I would like to think I would do the same thing.  The relationships built from the beginning of the movie flowed together and the young actors did a great job.  I think I loved this movie most of all for its 'non-perfect people', portraying people I could relate to.  I hope you see this movie soon if you haven't already.  I know you will love it too.
0141301139|4.0|Reading a Roald Dahl book for a bookloving child, -it has to be a success :-)My six year old love this book, as she does with most of Roald Dahl's books.<br />This is one of the early books from Roald Dahl's pen, but he has already started to develop his special style, the style making the small readers or listeners open their eyes and ears a little extra, wow, can this really be true? And of course all we read is true, in the world of Roald Dahl. Every kid instinctively understand this and can inhabit the Dahl-world in seconds.<br />Fantastic Mr. Fox is about Mr. Fox and his fight for his family's life, to escape from the three farmers, Boggis and Bunce and Bean, one fat one short one lean. Our loyalty is set right in the beginning of the book, and then we can fight with Mr. Fox and his children through the pages. Mr. Fox is always at least one step ahead of the three farmers, and his plans are so fantastic none of us have fantasy enough to come up with them ourselves, but when we read about the fox we say to ourselves, of course, it has to be like this, just like it was our own idea from the beginning.<br />No one can write fantastic stories like Roald Dahl. I am happy and thankful for all the books he manage to give us.<br />Britt Arnhild Lindland
B000003KMM|5.0|This movie is perfect.  Every scene moves the story and develops the characters.  It is packed with quotable lines, from beginning to end.  <BR>The comedy is character-driven; the story moves logically; the editing is masterful; the music is intelligent and  appropriate--in the case of the opening song by Randy Neuman, &quot;Burn on, big River,&quot;--it is both funny and historically accurate.  The Cayahoga River was once so polluted that it actually DID catch fire, back in the '70's. <BR>Every character is wonderful--and indespensible.  Bob Uecker as &quot;Harry Doyle&quot; is brilliantly funny. On top of everything, it is an inspiring sports movie and an absolutely superb baseball movie.<BR>WHY CAN'T I FIND IT ON DVD???
6304039506|5.0|I think this is my favorite film, so I have to add my impressions, even tho everything that could be said about it has already been said. A wonderful film, filled with incredible performances. Vivien Leighs &quot;Blanche&quot; is as fragile as that glass in Tennesse's Menagerie. She won the best actress Oscar for her interpretation of Tennessee Williams alter-ego, Blanche DuBois, the Southern belle on her last stop. She takes the role that Jessica Tandy famously originated in the stage production, and makes it her own. Her performance would have been enough to make this movie a milestone, but the fact there's two groundbreaking performances in it only adds to it's power and legend. Marlon Brandos &quot;Stanley Kowalski&quot;, which he originated on stage, was a revelation, then and now. A new kind of acting was brought to the general public. Cast with top New York &quot;method&quot; actors,(Kim Hunter &amp; Karl Malden received best-supporting actor Oscars)it was a once in a lifetime production. That Brando did not receive the award, (I believe Humphrey Bogart won that year, for &quot;The African Queen&quot;), does not take away the lasting effect Brandos role had on cinema. It has been said that Tennessee Williams found much humor in Blanche, his most famous creation, and, often during the stage performances, would cackle maniacally at her (his) remarks, and her final line... one of the most famous lines in entertainment history, &quot;I have always depended on the kindness of strangers&quot;, always struck him as incredibly funny, to the annoyance of many.(He wrote her, I guess he's entitled.) Maybe his own proximity to madness was a little too close to Blanche's. All said, from the moment she enters the movie, emerging from the steam of the dark New Orleans train station, to her final, lost exit, it is the beautiful and tragic Vivien Leighs Blanche who pervades this film. She and Tennessee were just too gentle for this world.
0060977493|4.0|This is one of those books that you really want to put down after the first half--but you keep on going because something within you tells you to read.  The God of Small Things is extremely poetic and not for those who want a quick start and finish.  Roy forces you to asorb each word and reflect on its validity within the novel.  The mundane is beautiful and complex, and the characters are well-defined, and well, somewhat confusing. But,  somehow, Roy brings it all together towards the end, and you leave the book feeling refreshed and moved.  Admittedly, I almost broke down and cried at the end.  Does anyone else think Roy is reminiscent of Toni Morrison?
B00005MNP8|5.0|Life was a bore in the mid '70's. Janis was gone, we were being bombarded with Olivia Newton John & Helen Reddy...Just when we had reached the breaking point...out emerged a blonde Goddess, with the voice of an angel that could just as quickly turn into a guttural snarl...we were saved...LIFE HAD MEANING AGAIN!!!! WE HAD DEBBIE HARRY!!!! Before Medusa, Mariah, and Monica, there was Blondie & Debbie Harry. To say this album was a breath of fresh air is an understatement. We flipped when we first heard it, and loved it just as much when we had played it to death and had to get it in cassette, and then c.d. This is a fabulous pop record, with great songs, that only Debbie Harry could have sung. I love all Blondies records, I play them to this day. But Parallel Lines was the first album that made them a sensation. Debbie is not only a fantastic, versatile singer, but the fact that she is also one of the centuries great beauties makes for a timeless combination. This album not only still sounds great, but brings back that great New York-Andy Warhol-C.B.G.B's-Studio 54 time, and the memories of many friends now gone. But it's great to know that someday, we that are left will be punking out to \\"Heart Of Glass\\", \\"Picture This\\",\\"One Way Or Another\\", etc...in the old folks home. I hope all todays divas pay homage to the girl who re- started the singing girl superstar. I recently saw Debbie & Chris Stein on \\"Musicians\\", she's just as beautiful, just as intelligent, and her singing has only improved with time. Yet, in this age of super-egos (you know who they are), she remains humble. What a lady, what a band, and what an album. Get it. If you had it, get it again. It's just as good as you remembered.
1556154844|5.0|This book should be a part of every programming curriculum, and sitting on every programmer's desk.  This is the definitive handbook to the process of taking software from design to quality, bug-free code.  Despite it's age, nearly every carefully researched practice and tip in this book is just as applicable today as it was in 1993.
B000066NW0|5.0|I instantly got hooked to Avril's debut single &quot;Complicated&quot; the moment I first heard it. I had to get this album the day it came out, and I did. ITS AMAZING. I'm pretty open when it comes to music, i listen to everything, hiphop, techno, rock... etc... I think this an artist who definitely is devoted to her music and will be around forever. I love her voice, she has the coolest accent ever and it shows up in her singing, I can't get enough of it! I'm amazed by Avril! Definitely pick up this album, Avril's got it all, a good voice, songwriting skills, and a unique style of her own. If you like this album, definitely check out Jennifer Paige's latest album &quot;Positively Somewhere&quot;, it's a little more mellow, but it's very very good as well!
B000063S6Z|2.0|Moby's popularity puzzles me.  He takes a rather weak &quot;hook&quot; and repeats it over and over and calls it a song.  Lyrics, same thing.  Almost every one of his songs follows a &quot;Moby formula.&quot; Perhaps it is because he goes for the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; that he appeals to so many people [ NOTE: Back in the 70's when I tried to get some people to listen to Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's &quot;Tarkus&quot; they complained that it was too &quot;complicated&quot; for them. ]<br />The only good thing he has done is show that with an Apple G4 computer and ProTools it is possible to record a CD and have someone listen to it.  I hope that it inspires some budding &quot;composers&quot; to reach out and go for it... and write some really good songs.
B000060P79|5.0|I first heard this band live at the pop disaster tour in boston, they opened for saves the day, green day and blink 182. from what i heard there i thought they were great, and the next day i rushed out and bought the cd. its even better than i thought it would be. this is a great album, and i wont be suprised if their next is even better. this band has talent!
6305127689|5.0|When I first saw this film back in high school I said ,So what? There wasn't much of a plot and it seemed more of a recruiting film for the Navy (or Air force). But I would be a liar if I did not admit that its great eye candy and wonderful escapism. This is THE film that put Tom Cruise on top and he's more or less stayed there since. I think that this film is far superior to his other action films, most notably both MI films and Days of Thunder (yuck!).<br />Top Gun is the story of Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell the son of a Navy pilot who died in Vietnam under a cloud of suspicion. Now Maverick all grown up is himself a Navy pilot who is trying to get out under his fathers shadow and trying to escape the stigma placed on his Dad. Unfortunetly Mavrick tries so hard to escape this stigma that he doesn't act like a team player and does his own thing. A big no no in the Navy.<br />While Top Gun isn't a cinematic masterpiece, I still find it to be an enjoyable film. I am giving it 5 stars because it is one of those films that you can watch again and again without getting bored. There isn't a big meaty plot to digest and the (conservative) military setting almost makes it timeless.<br />The action sequences are good, and Tom Cruise is a delight to watch. Its interesting to watch him now and the films that he has done since. And while he may be a little older he still essentially looks the same. One of the things I like to compare in this movie is Mavericks free wheeling \\"I'll do as I please\\" attitude, to that of rival pilot Iceman (played by Val Kilmer)a by the book pilot with an aristocratic mien.  They are almost different as night and day but still very much the same. Interesting how they both come together to be a military unit.<br />I don't think that there is a soul on earth who hasn't seen this film yet. But if you haven't get this movie for sheer pleasure.
B00003CX5P|4.0|If it wasn't for Jar Jar, Episode I would have been a great installment of the Star Wars saga, but of course, everyone knows that already.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this DVD -- particularly if you have a good home theater system.  The sound is awesome -- it really makes good use of surround sound.  The DVD also includes an interesting short on the making of the movie that has some good behind-the-scenes insights into casting and special effects (although you cringe every time you see the guy in the Jar Jar suit . . .)  Several scenes that were cut from the final movie are also included, but after seeing them, I can see why they were cut -- they are not particularly interesting.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD was just the music I've been waiting to come out for a while now!  Even though she's just 16, Avril has a great voice and style that I'm sure most people would like.  She almost reminds me of the band &quot;BIF Naked&quot; but I like her because she will influence teens more and is just the new kid on the block!  Way to go Avril Lavigne!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|There's a whole world out there in the ultra-low budget horror movies, specially those made in the 1970's, before the MTV era. Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' is a clear example. If you are one of those people who make this movie an all-time cult favorite (I know I am) this edition will be very good, second only to the Special Book-of-the-Dead Edition.<br />The picture and sound quality is excellent, the best I've ever seen in an Evil Dead DVD. Any imperfection you may find is justified (remember, this is a 1970's ultra-low budget), but what really makes this edition a worthy buy is the features. Both commentaries are great, and the one with Bruce Campbell is not to be missed, since is full of funny anecdotes and facts about the production of the film (actually, he never stops talking). In fact, both commentaries are a master class in film-making inventive. The deleted scenes are very good too, presented in a rough cut, but they're shown in a carrousel, so you can't access them individually. As for the picture gallery, it's very original, since it gives you not only images from the movie (like most DVD's do), but also pictures that were took from the premiere, and some nice material on the original posters. Definitely, the only flaw I can see in this edition is that, once again, we are left with no closed-captioned or subtitles of any kind, and that's a big no-no in my book. So in conclusion, I would give the movie 5 stars and the edition 4 stars.
0786915749|4.0|I loved this book! There were many reasons why I felt that this book was so good. One of those reasons is that the way the authors wrote the book that he and she tried to keep         it so that it would have some relavance to actual feelings and thoughts while still keeping the classic out-of-the-ordinary fantasy subjects such as mystical monsters and races of people that you would never think of in your wildest dreams. The story has excellent set of characters that have a very deep background in their imaginary world and complex emotional thoughts and feelings. The story also had a great sense of time so that you wouldn't have to spend days trying to figure out what time you were in, this kept a nice,organized plot. There were so many conflicts that were physical and emotional that you actually got the feeling of being there with the characters, joining them in their many struggles to say alive while living a decent life of constant joys and sorrows. Even though many people are not fans of fantasy they may still enjoy this book just because much of what is thought and said has to do with what you may experience in your every-day life. So I encourage everyone to at least read the first couple of chapters just to feel for themselves what I felt when I read this wonderful piece of modern american literature.
B00003CY5J|5.0|The Score is the greatest movie ever made for one reason. This reason is the two janitors Danny and Bryan. If it weren't for them this movie would be awful. Danny and Bryan provide many comical moments. Probably some of the greatest comical moments in any movie. One of the best funny scenes in the movie is Bryan's New Shoes. On the DVD version you can go directly to this hilarious scene. I have watched this scene at least 27 times and have laughed everytime. Of course there are many other great scenes with Danny and Bryan unfortunetally you cannot get directly to them like you can with Bryan's New Shoes. I would recomend buying this movie and watching it every day.
B0000029GA|3.0|I like all of Nas' material, so I bought this because the Source magazine and others said this CD was a classic.  Sorry, as much as I like hip hop, no, as much as I LOVE HIP HOP I just wasn't feeling this.  Maybe it was just that day.<br />Lyrically, Nas is always deep and for an MC at that time his content was thoughtful and provoking.  I guess it was just the beats I couldn't get into.<br />I may purchase it again to give a more detailed listen.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|If you are under 30 and have never even heard of the Beatles, start here.  By the time you are done your appreciation of the Beatles will lead you to buy more advanced collections.<br />There are 27 songs in all, 16 pages of liner notes which are mostly color photos of various Beatle album covers and singles from all across the world.<br />My only criticism is how lame the cover art is! With about 50 or 60 color shots inside the liner notes you think that the cover art could of reflected better the gravity this band had on popular culture and popular music for the past 1/3 of a century.<br />Tony
B00005UEAR|5.0|That's exactly what Dream Theater acomplished in this album.<BR>I gotta say that since Rudess joined the group Dream sounds alot better, and in this cd he proved him self to be a genius
B00006690F|4.0|All Eminem haters stop reading now and I'll see you on my next review. <br />Welcome home, Em. He's been gone for a while. \\"No he hasn't\\", you say, \\"he's released the Marshall Mathers LP in 2000 and the D-12 album last year\\" (don't admit that you actually bought that D-12 album, by the way). But true underground heads know that he took a vacation from the streets and started kicking some Generation-X, MTV-ready raps for all of America to eat up and/or criticize. But just like Jay-Z did with The Blueprint and Nas did with Stillmatic, Eminem brings it back to the streets with his third album, The Eminem Show. There's not one commercial, radio-friendly song on this album (except for \\"Without Me\\", which is the weakest track on here compared to the rest of the songs). Forget the title to the first single off his second album, THIS is the Real Slim Shady.<br />If you think he has totally ditched his style (shock value lyrics, dissing your favorite artists for no reason), you're wrong, as evidenced on \\"Without Me\\"'s third verse when he disses an *NSYNC member and Moby. The beef continues on \\"Say What You Say\\" when guest Dr. Dre takes shots at a certain producer in Atlanta: \\"I'm a giant...when I see you I'ma step on you and not even know it/You midget/...Over eighty million records sold/And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds.\\" Timbaland also puts his two cents in as well at the end of the track. Unfortunately, we heard all this dissing before (The Roots vs. Nas, Nas vs. Jay-Z, Jay-Z vs. anybody who ain't him) so you're left with a \\"Who cares?\\" feeling. Therefore, the diss records (with artists) thankfully stop there. <br />Eminem, still one of the best, if not THE best, rapper in the game, brings it on politically (\\"White America\\"), explains his reasoning for him hating his parents (\\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\"), and shows affection for the only female he loves: his daughter (\\"Hailie's Song\\"). And songs like \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\" talk about his recent lawsuit(s).Now I wouldn't dare rank Eminem with 2Pac, but just like Pac's Me Against the World versus his other albums, The Eminem Show is Em's darkest and most personal record, which is why it's his best album.<br />Dudes on the block will be arguing over what's the best song on the album, but my pick is \\"When the Music Stops\\" with D-12, where, for once, everyone sounds good. And \\"Soldier\\" and \\"Till I Collapse\\" tie at second. In fact, there's not one song worth skipping on this album, but the aforementioned \\"Without Me\\", which really sounds like \\"The Real Slim Shady Part 2\\", comes close.<br />You either like Eminem or you don't, and he's not gonna change for no one. Like he said a few years back, he just don't give a you-know-what. But those who think that Eminem has changed his style are just mad because they can't find the \\"hits\\" that they found on his last two albums. This album is for the true Eminem fans only, not the mainstream, current-fad loving, bandwagon-jumping individuals. You probably won't see another single off this album on TRL, so that means that most of his fans will throw this album away. Oh well, their loss.
0446608955|4.0|this is a great book very emotional and yet not too revealing...although it like a remake of Love Story...i loved it anyway...i recommend this book to anyone who wants to trully know what love is
B00003CXI1|3.0|Personally I despesze Harry Potter!I like watching movies but god it didn't make much sense to me.This movie left out stuff in the book and ohh!The thought of watching this movie was bad.It was really confusing and I couldn't figure out what was going on.I wouldn't mind seeing any of the other movies but as long as they don't have the extras.The extras were bogus and even though they were thought to be funny they weren't.Don't buy it.
B000066NW0|5.0|It takes a lot to really grab me in when it comes to musical stuff, but Avril's debut album \\"Let Go\\" has absolutely caught my attention. Her songs are catchy, and upbeat in most cases, and fun. But look a little deeper at her lyrics and her messages, and that's what really catches me. Many artists today write songs about their perfect boyfriend/girlfriend, how wonderful their life is...stuff that just isn't realistic. Not Avril. She's upfront and honest about being a teen. And that's what I like. She's REAL. Kudos to Avril for an amazing album...I am already looking forward to her next!!!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Excellent movie! Fantastic. I went in with high expectations and all were exceeded. The action was realistic - the swinging and the web weaving marvelous. The characters were endearing, believable and yet comic strip characters nonetheless. Willem Dafoe was a great villain - and I don't agree with the critics who said that he left something to be desired. Nothing about this movie left something to be desired - it's all there - action, suspense, great characters, love, romance, sadness, happiness, and some great acting. Great job by all!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah's sound is unlike any I've heard to date. The best thing about her is that she can't be classified as any one genre. She truly has &quot;a little bit of everything!&quot; One song is jazzy, another is country, and a third is a slow ballad. But her voice and writing are amazing! It's really a great CD for just relaxing and winding down...even better for a driving album!
B000066NW0|5.0|Yep, I'm a guy and I am not afraid to say that this CD is one of the best CDs that I have ever purchased.  Most people would say that a good CD is one that has maybe 5 or 6 good songs.  Well, this CD has 13 tracks and 13 excellent songs.  Each song is unique and each one is fun to listen to.  Her voice is incredible, and her melodies and harmonies are so crisp.  I cannot get enough.  I won't be taking this disc out of my CD player for some time.  It's pretty obvious that Avril has real talent and is not just another studio-perfected artist.  She writes her songs and plays guitar as well and she deserves every bit of success that comes to her.  She has a bright future ahead of her.  Whether you're a guy or girl, young or old, I recommend this CD because I'm hooked on Avril and you will be too.  There is more to Avril than just an absolutely beautiful face.  Buy the CD and you'll see.
B00005RFVL|5.0|I agree this is an excellent CD, I am listening to it constantly in the car.  However, there are a few misses: I prefer Bobby Darin's &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, Robbie's seems a bit slow, and his Mr. Bojangle's is OK, I can't help thinking he's trying to imitate Sammy Davis, Jr.  I was never very crazy about the song to begin with.  But he nails it with &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; and &quot;Did you Evah?&quot;.  The duets are tops, I love &quot;Something Stupid&quot; and &quot;Things&quot; and especially &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;.  The best thing about this whole CD is the music, the band is great!  &quot;Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me&quot;,&quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;, &quot;Miss Jones&quot; and &quot;Kick in the Head&quot; have the best musical numbers, it's really a treat to listen and sing along to as well.  Sensational singing and music, can't beat it!
B00000634L|5.0|A good girl friend of mine knew that I was into different, yet relaxing, mellow music.  She handed me this cd and said she liked it, but that I would LOVE it.  I totally did and still do.  This was about 6 months ago, and I have yet to get sick of it and I always have it in my car.  I have never heard such a unique sound full of various sounds and genres of music before.  The voices are very beautiful and eccentric, and the beats of music make you want to dance, and the mix of them together it's the most unique, fun-filled album I've ever heard.  It's just very different and there's a lot of humor mixed in which gives it a twist without being a full comedy cd.  I've had friends hear this with me, and they all just have to ask, &quot;Who is this?&quot;  It's my new favorite cd.  As soon as I get some money, I can guarantee I'm ordering discosis as well.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This collection of tunes is very hard to classify. Nora's voice is a little  jazzy and a little country but mostly easy listening. I am not much of a country music fan, but the jazz and country works well together. This disc will compliment and satisfy even the pickiest fans. Nora's voice has a lot of vocal range and she is never off key. Expect to be impressed. This girl can sing.<BR>My recommendation is to buy it. If you dont like it, give it to an enemy and they will soon be your friend.
B00003CY0V|3.0|I'm not really sure why this one bombed so much for me.  John Travolta, Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, lots of explosions, loud music, clever gadgets and plot, but it just didn't excite me like I was expecting it to.  Rent it? Definitely, but don't spend too much to buy your own copy.
B00000K19E|5.0|This is the greatest Sci Fi movie of all time .. what else can I say. The story and premise are awesome, I love movies that make people's view of the world/universe turn upside down. OK mabye Keanu can bug sometimes in some movies but he works in this one all things considered. The story and concepts are what really make this movie. The special effects and action are just icing on the cake. One hell of a movie, Mister Anderson.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|This was an &quot;Indiana Jones..&quot; movie for women.  Angelina Jolie is both tough and hot, appealing to both men and women.  The effects are very good and despite other reviews, the acting was very good (critics must remember to watch an actor's face as well as hearing the dialogue).  This is the type of movie that is just for fun, so if you go into it trying to find fault in ridiculous situations you won't be disappointed.  I hope there's a sequel in the works.
0380789035|5.0|I have a few levels of books... at the bottom there's the bad books, the ones you're forced to read or you start but which end up being so boring you fall asleep.  Then there's mediocre books, which are okay, but more along the 'read once and put on the shelf' category.  The next level is great books, which you'll read more than once, and will be rated among your favorites.<br />Then there's 'novel heroin.'  These are the books you can't put down, that you finish in one sitting, no matter how long the novel, the ones you think about long after you finish reading.  That's where I put American Gods.  Neil Gaiman has crafted a hypnotic work, one in which the prose itself literally sucks you into the novel and doesn't let go, even after the last page is read.  It's that good.<br />If you need a read for a rainy day, when you have nothing else to do, pick up this book.  Make sure you have plenty of time on your hands, though.  You won't be able to put it down.
0385006896|3.0|This my first foray into Holmes and I am thoroughly enjoying it. My only complaint is that the binding of this edition is beginning to come apart, in spite of gentle treatment. And I had bought this edition rather than the paperback because many large paperbacks have this very problem!
0446677450|5.0|I found this book enlightening and changed my perspective big time.  I was taught all of my life that I should go to college, get good grades and land a salaried job then work my way up.  However, I wasn't taught about the dangers of credit card debt and less emphasis on investing.  This book isn't about finding best job or pay, but about what's keeping you from being rich.  It's a great book and very easy to read.  I understood the basic concepts and I wish I learned those facts when I was younger and prevented myself going into debt in the first place.  And to invest.  If I avoided both mistakes, I probably would be traveling all over the world by now because of the investments to keep me out of hot water and not have to worry about finding the BEST job out there or higher costs of living, and only do what I love to do.  Enjoy life and worry less.
078062565X|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot;. I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as &quot;Kong&quot;, and who is, indeed,  king of the island.<br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot;.<br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious &quot;Kong&quot; is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of &quot;Kong&quot;. Notwithstanding the fact that &quot;Kong&quot; has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls &quot;King Kong&quot; and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!ly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!
B00003CXI1|2.0|The long awaited Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone movie was well worth the wait. Sad to say, however, that the long awaited DVD was not. The Special Features amount to &quot;theatrical trailers.&quot; Which is sad for a 2 disk set. I personally found the 2nd disk's &quot;game&quot; (which is what Disk 2 is) annoying. Unless you did everything right, you would not be allowed to advance. I can understand that the filmakers wanted to &quot;expand&quot; the harry potter world, and let kids roam freely. In which case why not make a PC game instead? why waste your money on making a DVD game, instead of providing the special features we have all come to expect and enjoy from DVD's? The only good thing about it is a 15min Interview with the filmakers which provides very little into the making of the movie. If you ask me, you're better off buying the Widescreen VHS or something than to waste your money on a 2 disk set with no features.
0871137380|5.0|I like war oriented novels, mostly midevil books and science fiction, but this book has stood out in my mind as one of the best written modern war novels i have ever read. I love the style Bowden uses - second by second accounts from different soldiers all over the city. Once you get into reading it you really feel as if you are part of a task force fighting for your life in the run down streets of Mogadishu. It is very specific, and you might get bogged down with all the information coming at you, but if you read the book in incriments rather than all at once than its much easier to stomach. Its hard to do though, because you get [pulled] in :) Its one of few books that will always captivate me long enough for me to lose track of time. Much better than the movie, i definatly recomend this novel.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is too awesome! We have watched it over and over again. Most of all, the cars in the movie were really cool. When you show cars like this like we do, it is nice to see a movie about them. The acting in the movie was good and had good morals, even though the ending could use a sequel.
B000066F6H|4.0|After watching the video for \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" on MTV2 and MuchMusic (if you happen to live in Canada), I knew I had to buy the CD.  And the CD doesn't disappoint one bit!  Sure there are obvious influences of 60's three-chord guitar pop mixed with the brashness of late 70's punk!  All the songs are two to three minutes long which is why the whole album clocks in at just about a half-hour.  Still, that's more than enough to satify this new fan.  I've played it quite a few times already!  Howlin' Pelle Almqvist (the main vocalist) and his four other cohorts take it to the max and then some!  Almqvist belts out the lyrics like there's no tomorrow while the remaining four play with a focus and passion like no other!  If you like The Strokes or The White Stripes, then this band is for you.  In my humble opinion, The Hives play more passionately than the two aforementioned bands! (don't get me wrong, both of them are still good).  A great CD to add to your collection!<br />BTW, this is an enhanced CD which contains the videos for \\"Die, All Right!\\", \\"Main Offender\\", and of course, \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\".
B000066F6H|3.0|By no means is this album bad, quite the contrary, its a good, solid album. Therein lies the problem, while the album is enjoyable, it doesn't really have any true standout tracks. Some of the songs are catchy, namely \\"Hate To Say I Told You So\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Main Offender\\" but the album lacks a certain something. The Hives may think they are the greatest band around, but they're not, neither are the Strokes but I would recommend either their(The Strokes) album, or either White Blood Cells or De Stijl by the White Stripes. However fans of the Stripes or the Strokes should check this album out, although its not great, it is better than most of the more popular bands around today, but don't expect anything revolutionary. Also if you like this album, you might want to look at cd's from The Refused and International Noise Conspiracy.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is not you're average Britney Spears. Her music is very original punk rock. She plays and writes her own music and I can relate to all her lyrics! She also has a great voice! Her first hit is Complicated which is such a good song. It's about being yourself and not following the crowd. Sk8tr Boi is Avril's next single and it's awesome! It's more rocked up than Complicatd and it's got funky tune! Another song I personally like is Things I'll Never Say. The title basically explains what it's about. Each of Avril's songs is like a different story. This girl sure has attitude!
B00003CXI1|5.0|While the Harry Potter books are undisputably fantastic, it is widly agreed that the movie is, well, good.  J.K.Rowlings has the humor of Roald Dahl and the magic of J. R. Tolkien.  That being said, any attempt to transform the books into movie form would be incrediably difficult, at best.  Director Chis Columbus did an acceptable (not wonderful) job.  But the makers of this DVD redeemed the movie's shortcomings.<br />This movie is true to the book regarding plot and events.  However, by skimming over the details - like all the magic Harry learns in school, Nevile's trials, compacting time, Harry's nightmares, etc.- much of the magic and charm was lost.(I should mention that my love of the books most certainly jaded the movie for me.  For example, my new boyfriend - in what was most certainly an attempt to win my affection - took me to see this in the theatre.  He -a grown man and a fan of NASCAR and baseball- thought it was a great movie.  We've been dating for a while now so I would know if it really bored him)<BR>The DVD restores much of the magic from the book in what is the most interactive, creative and fun DVD I have ever seen.<br />Most DVDs have &quot;special features&quot; consisting of bland mini-documentaries, cast lists and, occasionally, an intersting cut sceen or two.  This DVD has truly SPECIAL special features.  There is a game, a really cool guided 3-D tour of the grounds and of the dorm - you can choose which way to go, look at details - it is really neat.  You can make potions in class, go to Digon Alley and buy an owl, take money from Gringott's bank,and try out wands.  It is very imaginative.<br />There is also a cd-rom game which I have yet to play (because it might make it obvious to my co-workers that I'm goofing off).<br />This gets my stamp of approval. I liked it!
0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck truly captures the human innermost desire to choose the path of righteousness and darkness. In this novel, Steinbeck gently parallels the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel while inplicating and imposing his own underlying theme. This theme of humaninty, the choice of good and evil, will cause one to re-evaluate one's own opportunities to choose between the two. This book definately has real-life applications as well as present day relavence. It causes one to reflect on one's own life and perhaps elevate one to a new level of understanding of the world around oneself. Although events in this book may seem unorganized and somewhat random, Steinbeck tactfully organizes and arranges events so that the overall message of the book is still accomplished. The characters in this book are well developed which further adds to the greater effect of the novel. This book is one of the more substantial books that you will ever read.
B000002H6C|5.0|If you try only one Metallica album, try And Justice for All.  Many old school Metallica fans say Master of Puppets is their best....  And Justice For All sounds as if it was written with more care.  This is the kind of album you could play over and over again.
B000002540|5.0|this is a great live album! i don't think B.O.C. ever made a<br />better album! all the songs from SECRET TREATIES are much better<br />here, especially THE SUBHUMAN, which has an extended jam section<br />where DON ROESER does some very tasteful soloing. His lead guitar<br />playing is also all over BUCK'S BOOGIE AND MASERATI G.T.(I AINT<br />GOT YOU). Both of these songs are terrific, as is 7 SCREAMING<br />DIZBUSTERS, which is also vastly better than the studio version and has a neat little rap section in it where BLOOM does a little<br />parody of AINT LOVE STRANGE ( or is it ISN'T LOVE STRANGE?).<br />  B.O.C. have never rocked out so heavy or so consistently on<br />any other album of theirs. THIS IS A GREAT HARD ROCK-N-ROLL album<br />and a must have for B.O.C. fans!
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is definitely a great movie!  It is a chick flick, but I think that anyone can appreciate the comedy, humor, fashion, and even great music.

0716703440|5.0|While professional cosmologists usually prefer Weinberg's work- MWT's &quot;Gravitation&quot; is certainly more accessible and captivating. It can be read by undergraduates with joy (even laymen can indulge in at least 30% of the book). Overloaded with illustrations, introducing math apparatus in most cautious manner, full of historical and anecdotal information- cosmology aficionados will embrace this magnum opus as their Bible.
B00004WG2F|5.0|OMG-This movie is awesome!  I could watch it over and over and over again.  Brad Pitt is (as usual) hot and also a great actor in this family tragedy.  Julia Ormond is absolutely beautiful and precious.  Also a great actress who demonstrates her ability to love to the greatest depth.  Anthony Hopkins is also great as the father (SCREW 'EM!).  All in all a great movie...I highly recommend!
0671027344|5.0|No matter when you attended high school, but especially if you did so in the 1990s, this book will strike a chord. I found it to be an excellent window into the life of any teenager. I have recommended it to anyone I have met.
0684171600|5.0|Every image I have ever heard about pirates is perfectly captured in this one book and sets the standard for all others to live up to.  I wish I had had time to read this when I was younger since it was obviously written with younger readers in mind, but I enjoyed it just as well at my current age, and I look forward to reading it to my own children.<br />Since this was written for a younger reader, there is a lot of foreshadowing, which takes the edge off of the mystery and suspense.  I guess Stevenson did not want the younger readers to worry to much about whether the main character is going to be all right, so that they could focus more on enjoying the story.<br />This story has everything.  Buried treasure, maps, one legged pirates, people walking the plank, talking parrots, murder, secret islands, hangings, sea adventure, drunken sailors, and songs.  I can see where Jimmy Buffet probably got a lot of inspiration for some of his songs.<br />Long John Silver is a despicable character that you can't help admiring one minute, and hating the next, only to find yourself somewhere in between at the end of the story.  He's brave and cunning, but very conniving.  Jim Hawkins is an excellent young character who has the habit of always being in the right place at the right time.  He is young and impressionable, and I'm sure most of the readers can relate to him, and put themselves in his shoes.  Captain Flint, who's character is not actually in the book still carries a lot of weight as an evil villain.  Other characters not mentioned like the Doctor, Captain Smollett, and the Squire are quite honorable and hold their own throughout the story.<br />No matter how deranged and twisted it might seem, these pirates have their own laws and their own coat of honor which they keep to in one way or other throughout the story.  I wonder if Stevenson based this on any actual facts he may have obtained regarding real pirate's or whether he invented it all in his head.  Regardless it is fascinating how they justify their actions.  This book is on several lists as one of the top 100 books ever written, and I thoroughly agree with their assessment.  The images drawn is this particular book were wonderful, and really captured each scene.t is fascinating how they justify their actions.

6302779278|4.0|5 Star Costner in a 3 Star Movie gives this film a generous 4 Star rating...<br />The movie itself is worth renting once or twice, but Costner made it worth the purchase.  The simplicity of the role and the complexity of the character made it a performance only Kevin Costner could pull off.<br />One may fancy action over drama, but quite really, any action fan can take a look at Costner as the Bodyguard and appreciate the fact that, &quot;Man, that dude is hard!&quot;
0780622650|4.0|I loved seeing this movie in the theatre despite the critics reviews. It was fun, fanatstic and imaginative. The casting was cool and the many cameos of the original 60's TV cast was a nice touch. I saw it on the biggest screen in Hollywood and it made the experience that much better!<br />The DVD is very good. Lot's of extra features and fun stuff. Extremely organized and a lot bonus videos on the making of it and the casts reactions. This is a good look at the technical side of film making too.<br />Even some deleted scenes and story points that would have made the movie very different. This is a must for all new generation Sci Fi fans! &quot;Danger, Will Robinson, Danger&quot;!
B000001EGA|4.0|Capt. Fantastic is for me not only one of Elton's more accomplished albums but a defining moments of the mid-70s. I remember at the age of 12 watching the commercial for the album on English TV featuring a dreamy animation sequence where Elton floats around surrounded by butterflies.<br />Elton is one of the few commercial giants that it was OK to like. He was massive but, we all thought, a cool dude that wrote imaginative, catchy songs and released concept albums.<br />But Capt. Fantastic was no hits album like Don't Shoot Me... or Caribou. The title track took a while to get into but is an astonishing, winding masterpiec! with soulful, heartfelt lyrics by Bernie Taupin. Other gems include Tower of Babel, We all Fall in Love Sometimes, the very Queen-sounding Better Off Dead and Writing. The overall concept is let down slightly by a couple of weeker tracks, but that's what the programing button was made for.<br />Bare in mind Elton had hit a purple patch, releasing the soaring single, Philadelphia Freedom, which was one of the strongest songs I have heard bar none. So there you have it. Great album, great cover, great lyrics and the inclusion of three extra tunes including Philadelphia Freedom. Now that's what I call good value!
B00000G3PA|3.0|This is one of those movies that works much better on the small screen.<br />It has a great cast, some memorable performances and some state-of-the-art Special Effects, however, the story is a little week and even sappy in some points.<br />In the theatre it kind of bored me, but the DVD is much better. Not many extras but it does have the Aerosmith music video for the film on it.<br />This is a better film to watch in the living room with your family and should have passed the big screen. Disaster missed this mark!
B000063UR2|5.0|At last, a version of \\"Legend\\" that makes sense! The director's cut of Ridley Scott's fairy tale adventure was long overdue for release. Once fans see it, they'll never go back to the original U.S. theatrical release; I certainly won't.<br />Originally released in 1986, \\"Legend\\" was a box office bomb that definitely had the potential of being a success. It has an excellent storyline and icorporates the classic good vs. evil genre that fairy tales are known for. But the film suffered from really bad editing. Nearly thirty minutes of \\"Legend\\" was deleted for the U.S. version, leaving many scenes that would normally make sense seem chaotic, stupid, and unnecessary. Plus, Ridley Scott made the very unwise decision of replacing Jerry Goldsmith's original score with that of the pop group Tangerine Dream. When you compare an Academy Award winning film composer to an eighties rock group that no one remembers, I think it's obvious why it was an unwise decision. <br />The director's cut changes all that. Along with Jerry Goldsmith's original soundtrack being restored, many scenes cut from the U.S. version are restored as well, giving a once chaotic and lacking film clarity and wholeness. The crisp picture quality and sound lets us see and hear Ridley Scott's original vision of a world lived in long ago where light and dark co-exist, and the threat of never seeing another dawn looms dangerously over everything.<br />For those of you who remain devoted to the U.S. edit of \\"Legend\\" with the Tangrine Dream score, you'll be happy to hear that that version is also included in this package (but as I said before, once you see the director's cut, you'll never go back). On top of that, it includes a lot of extra things that will have fans cheering, such as the film's alternate opening, a reconstruction of a scene whose original print was lost, a \\"making of\\" documentary, and trailers (very good trailers, I might add), among other things. <br />Thanks to the technology of DVDs, people can finally see \\"Legend\\" as it was meant to be seen. I highly recomend it, especially to those who love fairy tales.

B000001DYD|3.0|I like PJ. Harvey her vocals and her style and her lyrics. This is her second solo album Rid Of Me released in 1993. (the year that all kinds of music was heard on the radio a lot). The album starts of well and the album is good listening to it all but this album could have been better. I read other reviews that Polly jean didnt like the album after it was finished and fans and critics didnt like it either that much (except of course hardcore). the album was meant to be raw but yes you cant hear everything that shes says. The album was also made so poorly. (raw rock ,grunge and punk is often like it). But her vocals could have been better arranged and the words could be listenable. the album is very good and its worth to buy but dont expect a 100 % masterpiece. But this LP is one of the best hard raw rock albums ive listened to.
B000002KZA|2.0|I consider this album a transitional one for DM...one where they began to leave behind the cute, juvenile light synth-pop of their first two albums and move towards a more evolving, mature sound.  Unfortunately, as with any transitional album, it is very hit and miss.<br />First, the good.  &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, though not having aged particularly well, remains a Depeche classic, especially with its memorable, singalong chorus.  The lyrics were somewhat naive, but Martin was at least moving beyond &quot;See You&quot; and songs of that nature.  &quot;And Then...&quot;, the album closer, is probably the best song on the album.  Well-written, thoughtful lyrics, and a nifty 12 string guitar part to boot, it's definitely one of the most listenable tracks from the early days.  &quot;Love, In Itself&quot; is acceptable, but contains one of the most annoying synth horn lines ever recorded.  <br />The rest of the album, however, falls short of the apparent goals DM were trying to reach.  &quot;Pipeline&quot;, a song noted amongst the electronic world as a revolutionary song because of it's liberal use of samples, is unfortunately also one of the most plodding, dreadful numbers DM have ever produced.  Samples or not, I find it extremely difficult to get through the first minute of this track.  Likewise, the dated synths and beats on songs such as &quot;Told You So&quot; and &quot;More than a Party&quot; (the latter having some of the worst lyrics ever penned by Mr. Gore) show a band that was making attempts to evolve musically, but had not yet found their feet.<br />Overall, this is not a &quot;terrible&quot; album, certainly an improvement over the embarassments that are their first two albums.  However, Depeche still had quite a ways to go before they could be considered a truly outsanding, and musically talented, band, a title which they would not earn until 1986's Black Celebration.
0060922583|5.0|This is a must read for anyone who is interested in understanding how science and metaphysics intersect. Talbot successfully presents his theory of mind, science, and spirituality by using holography as a metaphor. The quantum physicists saw something different when looking through the microscope, each reader of the \\"Holographic Universe\\" will conclude a different and unique interpretation. I loved reading this book so much I bought it for all my closest friends. Now we have the most intriguing and stimulating conversations on mind, science and spirituality.
B000001TVD|4.0|Funkadelic's Maggot Brain is an R&amp;B version of Black Sabbath, complete with awe-inspiring guitar and caustic lyrics. It's a shame that the late Eddie Hazel hasn't received his proper due as a guitarist, 'cause he's clearly worthy of the same recogniton accorded to the likes of Eric Clapton (overrated in my book), Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix. If there's one overall blemish to Maggot Brain, it's that the bass guitar is buried in the mix; certainly a glaring discrepancy in light of the bottombeat's importance.  If not for that, this release would be worthy of 5 stars easily.
6305428042|5.0|I got my Hocus Pocus DVD from Amazon today. Although, unfortunately,  there are no extras on the disc. The picture is widescreen. This  allows you to see more on the ends that are cut out on vhs's full screen format. The sound is fantastic 5.1 Surround Sound Dolby and, on my Bose system, it's wonderful. Bette's \\"I'll Put A Spell On You\\"  and \\"Sarah's Theme\\" are so much more enhanced to hear. Also, Binx's  shadow is the pointer to the menu. If you move Binx to the  chapters, they are displayed on tombstones. It's about time we got it on dvd  even if Disney didn't enhance it with Entertainment Tonight's Making  of Hocus Pocus, that I saw just before the film came out, deleted scenes or even a trailer.  The film is definitly 5 stars. Due to Disney's lack of support with any extras, Disney gets a 1 star for insensitivity to the fans. Nevertheless, buy it for the picture and sound.
6304082428|5.0|I absolutely loved the novel \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  If allowed, I could go on and on about it.  However, when screen versions of famous novels are released, it is almost always the case that certain elements are left out, new ones are added, or the plot is completely changed.  Thus, screen versions rarely turn out to be as good as the original novel.  Yet, this version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a definite exception.  The casting, the setting, the plot, and the portrayal of the characters all followed the book religiously, and more than surpassed my every expectation.  This is, undoubtedly, one of the very best screen adaptations of a novel ever done.  Even if you have never read a Jane Austin novel, or seen a movie based on one of her novels, I still recommend this mini-series as a wonderful romantic comedy, complete with plot twists and turns you may very well never see coming.  This is one of my favorite movies, period.  I highly recommend it.

I especially liked \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" with Hugh Grant & Emma Thompson, as well as the A&E versions of \\"Emma\\" and, particularly, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"(which I highly recommend). I was excited when I first saw previews for this move, since I had read and enjoyed the novel.  However, this movie did not seem to live up to my expectations, as it strayed much too far from the novel. I was particularly upset by the portrayal of Edmund's father and his horrendous treatment of slaves on the plantation, which not, even in the remotest sense, a part of the novel. If you are looking for a faithful adaptation of a Jane Austen novel, you may want to look elsewhere.
B00005LANG|5.0|This magnum opus of reggae albums is of such stature most of all because of the resonance, rather than the ever-evident catchiness, of its songs.  Reggae music's compactness and choppiness combined with its rich texture and seemingly instrinsic depth turned out to be a most suitable avenue for Bob Marley's social, political, and spiritual commentary, and his talent in the genre and earnest, forceful singing blended admirably.  Song titles and lyrics in Exodus demonstrate Bob's focus on Biblical metaphors as a means to galvanize people for action and self-examination, but he also sings about ordinary experiences in life and love.  Most of the songs are instantly recognizable classics, especially the title cut, \\"Jamming,\\" and \\"One Love.\\"  Bob's wringing declaration \\"Let's get together and feel alright\\" seems to be a musical parallel to the final line of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, with a universal aura, like something you heard in a previous life.  But you didn't, nor was this the case with any of the other songs, which are the unique genius of Bob Marley.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Dear Readers,<br />I highly recommend buying this collection from the ''Material Girl''. She has truly revolutionized pop music in itself. Madonna, GHV2. What a beautiful and timeless collection spanning the years of her reign to this day. She has proven herself, that she is the #1 best selling female artist out there. Mariah, Celine, Janet, or any other female pop artist comes close.<BR>You go gurl!
B00006690H|4.0|I couldent wait any longer!Its finally here...The Eminem Show.I bought it the first day it came out,and it is a great effort.This cd isnt funny like the last two,its more of a pure rap cd.The lyrics are a bit bazaar this time around,and his complaining about his life gets a wee bit anoying and old after hearing it on 2 records already.Needless to say,this is a great album anyway,but I think if you are new to Eminem you should buy the first two albums.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I rented this DVD to take to my 9-year old brother's birthday dinner. I thought the kids would enjoy it. Once it started, the whole family became engrossed. People have said that they were disappointed by the special effects, but you have to think beyond effects and consider the set itself...not to mention the costumes. I think it was all great! We had a lot of fun. You don't have to have read the books to see the movie, but I highly recommend doing so...the books are fabulous.<br />The only thing that disappointed us was the second CD with all of the extras. It took everybody quite a while to figure it all out and we found it to be very anti-climactic. That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. If it was just the movie, I definitely would have given it all 5.
0451457994|5.0|Arthur C. Clarke's tingles the mind of any reader with this masterpiece. The story of David Bowman and his incredible incounter with extraterrestrials is amazing and facinating. This is no ordinary run-in with E.T., but a complex and imaginative ride through time and space. The story connects a man-ape 3 million years ago, a specialist on the moon and a solo astronaut all together with shining black monoliths spred across our galaxy before recorded time, and on its ways composes brillant answers to the unspoken question we all ask whenever we gaze at the star. &quot;What's it all about?&quot; &quot;How did it all happen?&quot; The story's answers tickle the brain and establish new more elaborate questions while generating a sense of perspective about how small and obsolete we humans really are. The new perspective rids teh mind of worrisome burdens and give the reader a clear outlook on life and how large the universe is. Clarke's discrete descriptive style and attention to detail paints pictures in the mind that only the human imagination could create. His wording allows the reader to conceive the biginnings of vassly complicated new worlds and plains of life and energy, leaving our world and matter altogether behind. If you liked the movies, you'll be astounded by the book. A great story. A must read. Five stars!
B000002J1L|5.0|oooooooooooooh, what a great record! when i`m finished hearing The Fountain of Salmacis i`m astonished! The whole album is containing 7 songs that has it`s own personality! The Musical Box is the starting number wich i think is very good but not as good as the closing track! The Giant Hogweed proves that Tony Banks is one of the worlds greatest keyboardplayers and that is showed best in The Fountain of Salmacis wich i think is probably the best song they have ever made. The nostalgic organ playing by Banks in the middle is extremely nice. i never get tired of hearing it. Many people i have talked with doesn`t like Nursery Cryme whitch i just can`t understand but i recomend this cd to every human being that`s interested in 70ts music and wants to explore great music!!!!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is a wonderful assemblage of serious subjects, heavy riffage, and incredibly well-written music.  My personal favorite song is &quot;fade to black,&quot; with the beginning riff/solo guitar thing that i have been trying to play since i started playing guitar over a year ago.  All i can say is, buy this album if you are a fan of good music that is very original and complex.
B000002KHB|3.0|I don`t see why most people think Machine Head is the best album by Purple? ok, it`s containing a few good songs and i`m agree that it`s a good record but if you listen to Made IN Japan you can really hear what Highway Star and Space Trucking is made for. But if I`m going to be honest i mean that the Machine Head studio album is quite boring compared to In Rock,Burn and Stormbringer! If you are into the vocalist Ian Gillian you can hear that his voice isn`t that interesting as in In Rock....his voice was getting tired.
B00005NWM3|1.0|But even they weren't so earnestly awful. This is the musical equivelent of a tv show like &quot;The Bachelor&quot; or &quot;Survivor.&quot; It appeals to the bland mainstream demographic. They belong with Creed, Hootie, Dave Matthews, Lenny Kravitz, Barenaked Ladies and unfortunately many other current bands that make rock'n'roll seem about as exciting as watching cheese being made. With much emphasis on the word cheese.
B000066NW0|5.0|I feel in love with the single &quot;Complicated&quot; when it first came out, and have been waiting to hear more from Avril Lavigne. And surprisingly, &quot;Let Go&quot; is filled with great tracks. Some songs are more punk and rock, like &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;. Then there are songs like &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;My World&quot; which are more melodic and pop. Fans of artists like Michelle Branch, Sheryl Crow, M2M, and Natalie Imbruglia, as well as bands like The Calling will enjoy this album. Her lyrics are refreshingly honest and she has a great voice. She's young but doesn't try to be anything that she's not.
B00004YZFR|5.0|This is the greatest rock and roll documentary of all time. And not greatest in the way that \\"Citizen Kane\\" is considered the greatest film of all time - its revolutionary style seems commonplace now because everyone from that day forward used it - rather, \\"Gimme Shelter\\" provides a brilliant look at the event that could probably be pointed to as the death of the sixties culture and hippie free love type way of life. <br />While the film starts out as a documentary on the Rolling Stones, a wonderful one at that, once the concert at Altamont is reached, the story turns from the Stones to the culture around them. Shots of the concertgoers at Altamont seem outlandish to modern culture: here a woman solicits money for the Black Panthers, there a man sits up on a hill offering drugs as if he's reading their names out of a dictionary, In front naked men and women cavort and the peaceniks offer flowers to anyone in general. <br />The concert at Altamont in 1969 resulted in disaster when the Hell's Angels, recruited for free under the premise of all the beer they could drink throughout the day, turned steadily more and more violent against the increasingly intoxicated crowd. The scenes of violence as the bands in Altamont play grow steadily worse as bands like Jefferson Airplane get tossed around. (One of the greatest scenes in the film involves the Greatful Dead getting out of their helecopter, looking around, hearing about the concert, hopping back into their helecopter, and leaving.) <br />The film brilliantly captures this feeling of a free concert dedicated to peace and love going wrong as the Stones enter at sundown to play. As the Hell's Angels tear into the stoned crowd, Mick Jagger, in a politically correct attempt to preserve the peace, finally gives up and utters the famous phrase above: \\"Who's fighting, and what for?\\" The shots of the faces in the crowd staring up at Jagger in either incomprehension or fear of reprisal are incredibly powerful images, not to mention the Stones sitting in the editing room watching the final cut shaking their heads as they see the climax of the concert - a young black man dancing about wildly suddenly is seen with a gun in his hand - and the Hell's Angels beat him to death as the frenzied crowd backs away. Although the concert continues, the Altamont section of the film ends at that point, with Mick Jagger requesting the editors to play it back to see the man who lost his life. <br />The final sequence of the film - the dazed hippies marching across the fields as the sun sets while \\"Gimme Shelter\\" plays - is the summation of the film's statement of a loss of that innocence of the sixties.<br />For a great rock'n'roll time with the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world at their creative peak coupled with a startling view of the death of the sixties, this film takes the viewer through an unforgettable experience. (It also features camerawork by some unknown guy living in Northern California named George Lucas.)

B00000INEX|5.0|The entire Baby Einstein Series is wonderful \\"Age appropriate\\" video viewing for your baby.  Our daughter LOVES them all!

Variety is important.
0783227272|3.0|I sincerely believe that Spielberg had honest intentions to make statements about racism in this, but somehow, he gets just too caught up in making a spectacular movie.  <br />There are good elements in this movie, but they unfortunately are exterior elements, details like the dress of the characters, spectacular cinematography, and some very insightful acting, especially Anthony Hopkins as President John Quincy Adams.  All this adds to the entertainment aspect of the film but not to the essence.  He doesn't really force us to look at the morals and the ethics of the situation.  Instead, there's a superficiality throughout.  <br />I do believe that this story is worth telling, and the resulting movie is worth seeing because through the superficial entertainment the discerning viewer may be somewhat stimulated into thinking about the issues that could have been better tackled here.<br />As in SCHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg is looking at racism, but through different eyes.  Somehow, there is a condescending tone here, and he is not tuned in completely to the complexities of the situation portrayed.  <br />There's no way that I can trash this film.  On the other hand, I can not hold it up as an important film that must be seen.  For entertainment and for a partial look at the subject, this is OK.  For a deeper questioning, look elsewhere.  I've just reviewed a TV adaptation of AN OUTPOST OF PROGRESS, and while that is hardly spectacular, it gives far deeper insight.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View Is one of INCUBUS' More personal albums, and D.J. Kilmore combines unique and inspiring sounds and beats, for instance, take Aqueous Transmission whether your high as a kite or even drunk it sounds so amazing and crazy. Plus Bradon, Jose, and Mike (I forgot the name of the guy on bass) are the best at what they do, In my opinion that is.
B000002UB3|5.0|From start to finish, \\"Abbey Road\\" excels as one of the most complete, best albums in rock. It is difficult to overstate this.<br /><br />The hard rock of \\"Come Together\\" is countered immediately by a more romantic \\"Something,\\" then followed by a whimsical \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer.\\"<br /><br />Not long later, Ringo chimes in with his very Ringo voice, \\"Octopus's Garden.\\"<br /><br />\\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is a turn from pop music, to low, bar-like love song. Kind of bluesy, kind of funky.<br /><br />\\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Sun King\\" find the same them, but in very different melodies and tunes. Even now, you can hear \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" do-do-do, can't you?<br /><br />\\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" I love the song, but have no idea what it is about.<br /><br />\\"Golden Slumbers\\" gains its breath from old English poem, and it still enjoys the melodic charm of a simple bit of verse.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"Abbey Road\\" by the Beatles.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
0553583182|5.0|This is the best book about positive thinking that I have ever read. Norman Peale tends to be lightweight. Some of the more metaphysical books tend to get a bit wacky. Murphy sees positive thinking as a form of self hypnosis and self programming so he rarely goes off the deep end into questionable theology. Very well written and well thought out. This is Murphy's best book and is well worth getting. I found myself underlining many passages because of their insight, directness, succinctness. Yes, this book can change your life. I was very engrossed with its ideas for a month or two and see it as a resource to return to whenever I need a new mental outlook.  A cognitive approach that is well worth reading.
B000006O7C|5.0|I'm listening to &quot;Morning Theft&quot; for about the 12th time in a row now.  Having fallen in love with &quot;Grace&quot; last year I wasn't sure which album to buy next.  Based on the cover I assumed this was full of demos pre-&quot;Grace&quot;.  This is not.  This is POST &quot;GRACE&quot;...and for me...having assumed &quot;Grace&quot; was his latest material once I threw this in and realized what this was...it was as if he had come down from heaven to sing these songs again...the moment I realize the true beauty of a Jeff Buckly song is quite a priceless thing...and it's happened again with &quot;Morning Theft&quot;...I guess just wanted to make sure everybody realized this was POST &quot;Grace&quot; basically because I didn't know that until after I purchased it.  And if I did know that I would've bought it sooner.  Enjoy....<BR>P.S.  Make that 14 times in a row now
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game was a book I thoroughly like, as did many other people. I received this book as a birthday present from a friend, and did not think much of it as I opened it, but after reading it I loved it.<BR> Ender Wiggin is the main character in this book. He is so intelligent that in the beginning he has very few friends, and he is only six years old. I know, I know, who wants to read about a six year old, but this is more like a smart adult.<BR> This story takes place in the future, mainly at Battle School, where super intelligent children like Ender go for training, and later it takes place in Command School. The government wants children that are intelligent, compassionate, and killers when necessary. They were depending on these children to find one child to be a commander and defeat the buggers.<BR> In the beginning of the book couples on earth are allowed two children, unless like Mr. And Mrs. Wiggin the government allows them to have a third.<BR> Eighty years ago the humans who were stretched over many universes went against the buggers. Buggers were insect like beings that planned on taking over the earth. They almost had us defeated until Mazer Rackham, a famous commander, defeated them in the last battle. <BR> Although Ender makes many friends along the way, but he also makes many enemies also.<BR> Ender's brother and sister are both intelligent also. They have their own little plot in the story, they know that if the buggers are defeated, that there will be another war here on Earth, and they are trying to get the word out.<BR> I would recommend this book to anyone of any age because this book is at times being told by grown ups and younger children.

630469654X|5.0|This is one of those \\"guilty pleasures\\" people talk about. Despite its many flaws, it still stands out as one of my favorite movies -- I watch it more often than I will admit. Yes, the story can get stilted. Yes, it's more full of authenticity errors than your average LARP. Yes, the soundtrack's electric guitars and synth sound ridiculous. Yes, the script forces the actors to say really stupid things. But you know what? It's still a great movie, in the tradition of the greatest medieval romances. <br />It borrows shamelessly from many sources, ending up with a nearly archetypical story of a lady in love with a knight and a dreadful, awe-inspiringly-unpleasant curse preventing them from being together. Rutger Hauer makes his knight, Nevarre, brim with barely-controlled fury, tension, violence, and desire the entire movie. Michelle Pfeiffer's Isabeau is delicate and airy, but capable and somewhat irritated with (and resigned to) Nevarre's impulsiveness and violence, a welcome change from standard damsels-in-distress. Broderick's \\"Mouse\\" is a false note -- it's like Ferris Bueller got set down in 13th-century France. The whole \\"talking to yourself to illustrate motive\\" thing is annoying. But he does provide some welcome humor (the \\"she flew away, Your Honor!\\" line is one of the best in the movie). The sets are excellent, the scenery is incredible, the costumes are all right (with the exception of Isabeau's hair, which looks just flat-out WRONG the whole way through the movie, and Nevarre, whose black leather is totally cool, even makes squeaky leather noises when he walks), and I just love the horse, who is a character in his own right.<br />There are very few goodies on the DVD, but the few there are, and the widescreening, make it worthwhile as a purchase. I'm definitely glad I got mine. Incidentally, while it has no real sex or graphic violence, I don't think it'd be great for little kids to see due to some pretty mature ideas in it, including very naughty priests.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Even back in the 1950's, in this quaint old-fashioned French town, they considered chocolate as an 'indulgence'. No, they were not concerned with the possible weight gain or health problems brought about by eating excessive amounts of chocolate.  They deemed this treat as a temptation, &amp; since it brings too much pleasure to the eater, they (particularly the town's mayor) considered it grave &amp; sinful.  <br />As a viewer, I would deem the 'chocolat' as something intoxicating &amp; liberating.  It represents anything that would bring pleasure to the human senses.  True, it unleashed passion &amp; sensuality among couples.  But it also signified something deeper than skin-deep gratification.  It also represented anything that would liberate the town folks from their fears, insecurities, loneliness &amp; prejudices --- whether it be directly or indirectly.<br />Like chocolate, culture &amp; religion come in different forms...some are common &amp; widely accepted while others are a bit different &amp; stand out like a sore thumb.  But, also like chocolate, uniqueness adds to its beauty.  <br />So the next time you find yourself staring at a box of chocolate, do not judge its beauty simply by its shape or packaging.  Why don't you cut out on your prejudices, broaden your horizons, widen your options &amp; enjoy the experience of a mouth-watering treat.  <br />How about one of those melt-in-you-mouth-not-in-your-hand chocs?

0962477060|5.0|I have been playing the guitar for two years now and thought I was making good progress until I tried to play with other experienced guitar players.  I realized that I had a long way to go about mastering the guitar.  Rather than really learning the guitar, I was just practicing songs and thinking real progress was being made.  Promptly after my failed attempt of playing with my experienced friends, I bought this book and the light came on.  I mean, it was like an explosion that lifted me to an entirely different level.  I have never learned so much from any book Ive ever read - and Ive read a lot of books.  All of the others are difficult to follow and assume that the reader is familiar with profound guitar theory knowledge. Edwards, on the other hand, takes all of the confusion and hones in on the most fundamental aspects of the guitar.  The CAGED method is absolutely the best way to learn the guitar.  If you follow this book from page one and really work on it, you will begin to notice drastic improvements and everything will begin to make sense - I mean, you will have an epiphany one day and say, \\"I've got it!\\"  I have never written a review for a book until now - this is how strongly I feel about the knowledge you will take away from this book.  Best guitar book ever published.

B00005NWM3|1.0|How would you all like it if I wrote the same review over and over and over and over again. Thats what this album is all about. The songs are very poorly written the same lyrics are used over and over on all the songs. How you remind me that song is a joke I know it gets alot of air play and thats because it easy to memorize the word and sing along to but if you really listen to it its a horrible song and it the same way with To bad. I cant wait for the Nickleback era to be over. This isnt rock&roll buy any strecth of the imagination. This is called stealing your money. Any time you see an album with 39 minutes of track time you have to question it. If you like lstening to garbage than this album is for you.

It shows, that an utopia cannot exist in this world. <BR>We think that everybody has to read this novel.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne burst onto the music scene with &quot;Complicated,&quot; a mid-tempo pop-rock tune that was a hit in the land of both radio and video. &quot;Let Go,&quot; her debut album, shows that this teenage singer-songwriter-guitarist has a lot of energy and a witty outlook on life.<br />&quot;Losing Grip&quot; kicks the CD off with an angst-ridden song that begins mellow and builds to a roar. &quot;Why should I care? / 'Cause you weren't there / When I was scared / I was so alone.&quot; It's for everyone who has suddenly realized that everything isn't okay and who feels as if their cries are going unanswered. This is probably my favorite track on the album.<br />&quot;Complicated,&quot; the breakout hit, is all about being yourself instead of pretending to be something you're not. I love that the lyrics are both realistic and optimistic.<br />The bouncy &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; should definitely be a future single. It tells the story of a girl who passed up a chance with a boy because her friends didn't care for him, and she regrets it years later. The guitar-driven song is very bouncy.<br />Avril belts her heart out on the ballads one moment (&quot;I'm With You,&quot; &quot;Naked&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot;) and demands to be noticed the next (&quot;Unwanted&quot;). From the observant (&quot;Mobile&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;) to the strong-willed (&quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;) to the inquisitive (&quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;), she is not afraid to rock out and speak her mind.  At times, her voice and style reminds me of the band Fisher, but with a little more edge to it.<br />This album is &quot;Anything But Ordinary.&quot; It is sure to please folks who heard of her through her first hit, and may she have many others to come. Her style is very refreshing. While she's not necessarily mainstream, she is also not acting different simply to get attention. She's proud of who she is.<br />I strongly recommend this album to folks who like an album that plays well from start to finish, music that easily transitions from rock to adult contemporary, and lyrics that resonate the emotions and questions we all possess.s who like an album that plays well from start to finish, music that easily transitions from rock to adult contemporary, and lyrics that resonate the emotions and questions we all possess.

B000063S6Z|1.0|Many times, I need to play a CD several times to understand and appreciate what an artist intended to express that wasn't apparent on the first listening. Every time I play this CD, however, I wonder why I wasted my money on it. This has got to be some of the most bland, uninspired music I've heard in a long time. Moby's formula of using repetitive loops with found vocals lifted from obscure gospel or soul artists is very stale to say the least. His original compositions are so amateurish, I've heard more polished, interesting electronic compositions from complete unknowns who post their music to web forums. ... I believe his previous CD, \\"Play\\" was possibly just a stroke of luck in that it was reasonably decent. He is reverting back to the marginal lack of talent that he showed in his earlier efforts. ...
038533558X|3.0|\\"Gone for Good\\" is without a doubt terrific mystery novel. All the twists and turns keep you on the edge throughout the entire book. But it isn't quite as smooth as the author's previous efforts. Also, some of it really sounded like Myron Bolitar novel with the characters having been replaced with new ones. It is good, but not as good as earlier ones.
0767812166|4.0|STARMAN [Amazon] [Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen, Charles Martin Smith / Directed by John Carpenter / 1984 / 115 minutes / Rated PG-13]<br />This 1984 movie about a space alien who takes on the physical appearance of a young woman's dead husband hasn't aged as well as some sci-fi movie of the period because the special effects now seem especially cheesy. That aspect, however, was never among the reasons to see \\"Starman\\". What makes it worthwhile are it quirky, touching love story, its gentle humor, and Jeff Bridges extraordinary performance as the alien, for which he received an Oscar nomination. Here, he proved himself to be among the great physical actors of his generation. Even if the story itself were not so strong, it would be worth watching the movie simply to see Bridges. <br />Starman comes to visit our planet after we launch a satellite that broadcasts an `invitation' to any intelligent life that might be out there. As you might expect, though, when he gets here, the first thing our military does is to shoot him down. After bailing out, he makes his way to the isolated home of Jenny Hayden [Karen Allen], the widow. While she is sleeping, he looks around the house and finds some home movies and a photo album. This is how he finds and assumes the shape off her husband [we never see Starman's real shape]. His actions awaken her, and she has a shocked first encounter with this apparition. As military helicopters approach, Starman has no choice but to commandeer Jenny and her car for a mad dash across the country to Arizona, where he has one chance to rendezvous with a rescue ship from home. Along the way, they have many exciting adventures. They also discover that compassion and love may be truly universal.<br />This is a lovely, touching film and certainly an atypical one for director John Carpenter.

6304211740|3.0|This is the second version of Jane Eyre I've seen, and compared to the 1983 Dalton/Clarke version, it is a little lacking. The emotion isn't there, and the movie, overall, is too short to show all the themes and conflicts that occur in the story. I was also annoyed that they left my favorite line: &quot;Oh Jane, my hope, my love, my life!&quot; out. It did have its good points, though. Gainsbourg portrayed a very accurate Jane while young Jane, Adele, and Mrs. Fairfax did exceptionally wonderful jobs as their respective characters. If you love Jane's story, be sure to buy it.
B000055X3U|5.0|All what I can say is that I started to listen metal music in 1989 and this is one of the best musical discoveries I´ve ever had!<br />The only negative point is that tracks 10, 11 , 12 and 13 are simply &quot;fillers&quot; in my opinion (curiously the last 4 tracks of the CD he,he..) , but all the first 9 songs are amazing, and they´re what this review is about.<br />This is the most emotional album I´ve ever heard, so depressing and so beautiful at the same time, the songwriting is unbeatable and the production very good. Some people would label this as &quot;melancholic rock&quot; and I think it´s a pretty good name for this kind of music!!<br />All what I can say is that &quot;Judgement&quot; is a devastating album, one of the CD´s with more &quot;feeling&quot; that I´ve ever listen... this is not classic metal at all, it´s mellow and emotional stuff, but if you´re an open minded fan I´m sure you won´t be dissapointed, buy this!!

B00005JKJA|1.0|Quite simply, Mulholland Drive doesn't contain a shred of plot; it is just a series of unrelated scenes.

On the other hand, if you want to marvel over pseudo-intellectual BS that nobody can understand, then this is the perfect movie for you.
0517122707|5.0|Initially, one is tempted to regard the protagonist Ignatius as a vile, offensive slob, but as you continue, you come to admire him for his gall, his meanness, his bloated self-confidence and his overwhelming self-righteousness. The plaisir du texte is of course, enhanced by the wonderful interweaving web of plot and subplots, and by the colourful array of characters. This is one of those rare novels that becomes so addictive that you compulsively read on between the fits of hysterical laughter. Not one word is unnecessary, not once sentence is superfluous. It is in fact, absolutely brilliant and for someone like myself who has no intention of reading Rabelais or Cervantes, it is sufficient. I recommend it also as a very effective cure for depression.
0679642609|5.0|It's long overdue that the public receives a modernernized translation of Marcus Aurelius's &quot;Meditations&quot;. Up until now, all the translations that we had available to us in English of this intriguing work have been, well, rather dull and &quot;dry&quot;. All that is changed. Gregory Hayes has done some fine work here. I personally congratulate him, and thank him for his efforts.<br />I still wouldn't necessarily call this book a thrill-a-minute, page-turner of suspense, but thanks to a more contemporary language-treatment, the experience is a whole lot less burdensome to get through. The ride may not be the best fun you've ever had reading a book, but it's considerably less painful now, thanks to this &quot;user-friendly&quot; updated version.<br />Comparison to older translations shows it to be accurate in meaning and tone, and if he were alive today, I think Marcus Aurelius would recommend this version of his work for us (as modern readers) to enjoy for years to come.
0783227434|4.0|Buyer beware:  there are so many different versions of Army of Darkness on video and DVD that you have to be careful which one you buy.  If you want the best version, get the regular edition (not the director's cut, bootleg version, or special edition) if you want the full tilt comic blast that is Army of Darkness.  The other versions with alternate endings cut out most of Ash's great one liners, so be careful!  Now onto the movie; Army of Darkness finds Ash in midevil times after being transported there at the end of Evil Dead 2.  While there, he must find the Necronomicon to get back home, and stop an entire army of the undead being led by his devilish alter ego Evil Ash.  While its not as scary, bloody, or gorey as Evil Dead 1&2, Army of Darkness sacrifices all that for some Three Stooges-esque slapstick comedy, and a display and tribute of sorts to Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation techniques of years ago.  While its not on the same level of overall greatness as Evil Dead 1&2, Army of Darkness is a fitting ending to the Evil Dead series, and you'll laugh an awful lot from beginning to end.
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\" was a big surprise for me when i listened to it. I expected it to be more shock-rap, like \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". However, this album is surprisingly deep and personal, and the listener really feels like they get to know Eminem for the first time.<br />White America-an angry introduction, spitting lyrics about how and why the public fell in love/hate with him.3 out of 5 stars<br />Business-batman & robin parody with great Dr. Dre produced beat, mainly about what happened in the rap game while Em was gone.4/5<br />Cleanin Out My Closet-the first personal song on the album, shockingly introspective. mostly Em shouting thoughts about the relationship between him and his mother.4/5<br />Square Dance-strange but fun southern bounce type of track, mostly about the problems facing america, sarcasticly saying to have fun because theres nothing to worry about.3/5<br />Soldier-intense song about Em never giving up in the face of adversity, very fast paced.4/5<br />Sing About Hollywood-mostly about life in the public eye, and what's happened to Eminem since his last album came out.3/5<br />Drips-story about how Eminem and Obie Trice get std's from \\"Denise\\", worst track on album, but still good.3/5<br />Without Me-the first single, sounds like \\"The Real Slim Shady\\", commercial but still hilarious, very catchy.4/5<br />Sing For The Moment-another intensly personal song, one of the best on the album, INCREDIBELY touching third verse.5/5<br />Superman-song about Eminem getting in another relationship, great beat, witty and funny.5/5<br />Hailey's Song-Eminem sings on this song, but only for half the song, and the other half saves it.3/5<br />When The Music Stops-with D-12, about the impact of music on the minds of America's youth, usual wild lyrics by D-12.4/5<br />Say What You Say-duet with Dr. Dre, partially dissing Jermaine Dupri, Dre-\\"over 80 million records sold, and i ain't have to do it with 10 or 11 year olds\\" lmao.4/5<br />Till I Collapse-Most intense song Eminem's ever put out, very hardcore and angry, gets me PISSED, great song.5/5<br />My Dad's Gone Crazy-funny song, features Eminem's daughter, sounds like something from \\"The Slim Shady LP\\".3/5<br />When this whole album's put together, it makes for an incredible mix of music, Eminem's best album, best of 2002.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This is what DVD's are made for.  The plethora of special features makes this possibly the best put together DVD out there right now, all DVD's should be made like this, but now onto the movie itself.  From the start, Episode 1 had a lot going against it.  Few people thought it could live up to the original trilogy, combined with the hammy acting and excessive CGI effects, not to mention everyone's constant bitching and moaning about Jar-Jar Binks, I was surprised it made as much money as it did (then again its a Star Wars movie).  Ewan McGregor is great as the young Obi-Wan, while Liam Neeson brings a strong, silent edge in his role.  Jake Lloyd however, can't act to save his life.  All his lines sounded so forced and unconvincing, not to mention the fact this is the kid who is supposed to become Darth Vader, I just can't see that cute little kid becoming such an evil force.  Ray Park is good as Darth Maul, only I wish we could have seen more of him, and the final fight scene is great as well.  George Lucas has totally commercialized the Star Wars saga, and it shows here which drags the movie down a lot (he had said he thought about casting N*Sync as Jedi Knights in Episode 2 to please his daughter), and the total credibility that the series once had quickly fades away by the time the credits start rolling.  However, I'm thankfull that Episode 2 is much better than Episode 1, but hardcore Star Wars fans will love it either way.  Bottom line: great DVD, ok movie.
B000009CEM|4.0|Ok, I just reviewed like 5 alternative albums in a row.  I gotta get back into some metal now.  This is just a brilliant concept album.  Great music, great storyline, and the little blurbs in the booklet between lyrics are helpful.  Fear Factory's music is difficult to describe.  It's like some band in the distant future found some old thrash and death metal CD's, and decided to duplicate it in their futuristic fashion.  The music is very innovative, and has a feel that seems beyond its time.<br /> The guitar playing is really great.  Dino doesn't do any fast shred solos or anything, but he's an awesome rhythm player.  It's wrong to call him a \\"numetal guitarist\\" simply because he doesn't do solos.  This guy has a mean right hand.  Listen to the opening riffs of \\"Shock\\" and \\"Securitron\\", and you'll see what I mean.  The songs here are heavy, vicious, and bloodthirsty.  Burton's vocals are otherworldly.  He doesn't even sound human, I would never imagine a mortal man could sing like that.  Oh, and let's not forget about Ray Herrera.  A monstrous drummer.  Some of his beats are like jackhammer blasts meant to drive you into the ground.  He does excellent double bass work, and he's got a lot of dexterity as well, as you will see in the title track and \\"Freedom or Fire\\".  <br />There are some great ballads here amongst the heaviness as well.  \\"Descent\\" has some great melodic guitarwork, \\"Resurrection\\" has a dynamite chorus, and \\"Timelessness\\" is a great mournful song to end it all.  This album has but one flaw: \\"Edgecrusher\\".  Way too numetal sounding.  It doesn't fit at all, and it totally disrupts the flow of the album.  Plus, the turntables are pointless, and don't belong here.  They could have made a better theme for the good old Edgecrusher.  This song makes him sound like a wrestler or something.<br />Other than that, this is a great album.  And just so you know, it's not numetal.  It's much heavier, more intelligent, and more complex.  Not quite as good as \\"Demanufacture\\", but this is great, great stuff.
B0000009RT|5.0|There was one thing I failed to mention in my last review for this album: that with this album( continuing from my last review), The Mothers of Invention were musically ahead of other groups, like the Beatles and the Who, where as, groups like the 2 groups I just mentioned, seemed to be sort of halfway there, per say, at that time.  In other words, the Mothers seemed to be &quot;there&quot; already, completely;msically, of coarse. By the way, I, personally, find this album a bit easier to listen to than their '68 album, &quot;We're Only In It For The Money.&quot; Maybe it will be for you, as well. &quot;...Not that it makes a heck of a lot of difference to you.&quot;

B000066C1N|4.0|I love the soundtrack! I like Get Off My Back, but also, Sound the Bugle almost made me cry during the movie... so sad! Overall, I really like the songs. I'm not a big fan of instrumentals, but these were better than most!
B00003CX5P|4.0|As a Star Wars fan, I was of course excited and overwhelmed by all of the publicity and hype for what was then the upcoming \\"Phantom Menace.\\"  I must admit, I read as many articles, watched as many interviews, listened to as many tracks from the soundtrack, and tuned in to as many radios programs for inside scoops as I was able to.   I even waited in line for an hour and a half just to get tickets a week in advance! Yes, you're probably thinking I am a loser, and you are probably right.  Anyways, I saw the movie the day it came out and like everyone else in the theater I walked out of the movie feeling like I had just been on some awesome journey, wanting more.  The new special effects were astounding to behold and single-handedly transported you to another universe altogether.  I fear that maybe this film relied too heavily on its explosions, battles, computer generated characters and background filler, that there was not much left for storyline and character development.  Don't get me wrong, it was a good motion picture but I think it should have dealt with less comedic relief (Jar Jar Binks)and more solid progression of story.  At some points I thought to myself that many of the jokes were just unnecessary slapstick comedy.  I guess I was just expecting something more mature and plot driven.  It was difficult to critique this movie, and possibly I am being too picky because of my viewpoint of a big fan of the series.  But all in all, \\"Phantom Menace,\\" now finally after a very long wait on DVD, is an action-packed fun movie for the whole family.  It is full of twists and turns that follow Obi-wan Kenobi (played by Ewan McGregor) Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Lloyd), and the reserved Queen Amidala (played by the lovely Natalie Portman) as they fight to free Naboo (Amidala's home planet) from the invasions of the evil Trade Federation.  We are introduced to new characters such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Nute Gunray, Darth Maul, and the mysterious Darth Sidious along the way.  The DVD offers behind the scenes footage as well as many interesting scenes that did not make it into the film itself.  Some of these scenes may shed some light on the plot, but most of them are simply fun to watch.  There is also a commentary included where the director George Lucas and the producer Rick McCallum talk about the process of making the film and inside stories that went along with its production. The picture quality as well as the sound quality is astounding, making the experience of Episode I all the better.  In short this DVD will be a great addition to the present saga, and is a must have in the home of whatever degree of Star Wars fans.
0553269631|5.0|This is an easy to read, sad and thought provoking novel that stayed with me a long time after finishing. The story involves the lives of four characters as they revolve around the life of a deaf mute in a small southern town in the 1930's.  The story of the five main characters is so void of ego and superficiality that it allows their voices to resonate after you've finished with such haunting power it is miraculus to behold.  Carson McCullers, who was increadibly only 23 when she wrote the book, writes with such fresh clean talent and crafts the arc of the characters with such sublety that it didn't hit me until the very end of the book where the elusive paths of the characters were leading to.  The inside cover of the book calls McCullers a creative genius and after reading it I would have to be inclined to agree.  The book reminds us that innocence at any age may be fleeting, so hold on to it as long as you can.
B00006690G|5.0|Only a few rappers in the world today, yes, only a few, can rhyme and put sentences together as well as Eminem.  Canibus, Eminem, and Rakim are all 3 rappers that have reached a certain level in rapping that I can't explain.  Eminems verses do not sound anything like any of rappers verses today.  He spends time with his lyrics and seems to rhyme the beginning of sentences as well as the end, and the result is crazy.  Every single song is good.  Don't bother bootlegging it, just go buy it.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer is ubiquitous in the music world and they cheekily demand respect, and the reason can be found in their debut album affectionately called the Blue Album. &quot;Pinkerton&quot; is uncharacteristic and has its angry cult following and the recent Green Album brought new fans with its poppy likeability and radio play, but Everyone should have their first album. If you don't, quite frankly it's just strange. You can't fully appreciate the growth of Weezer without hearing how pointedly perfect they were on Blue with songs such as &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot; &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; &quot;Undone (The Sweater Song)&quot; &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;. They've grown up in sound, and they're still a solid band, but oh how sublimly they captured something just perfect with that album--whatever music you like, this is an album that should be in your collection. Geeky glory in great, fun rock talking about youthful misfits. If you're even considering it, just buy it (finally), it's a sure thing. This is about as perfect as any album can get, and I doubt many would disagree. If you do, frankly, just strange.
B00003CXA4|4.0|Perhaps no historical document on film has such a profound modern political impact as \\"Gandhi\\". When you consider the current situation in the Middle-East, nothing in artistic form so broadly displays the roots of its foundation as this film. Directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, and permitted by the government of India, \\"Gandhi\\" is singularized by the brilliant performance of Sir Ben Kingsley. Indeed, one of the great film acting performances of all time.<br />We begin the film journey, for indeed this is quite the epic running over three hours long, in a train car as young Gandhi is headed to South Africa. Unbeknownst to him, dark skinned men are not allowed in first class seats, and since he is a lawyer, and quite accustomed to first-class, he refuses to move. Little do the men who throw him from the train know that they are lighting a fire that would eventually take down an Empire. <br />... <br />There are many poignant scenes in Gandhi's struggle on film, one of which is the massacre at Jallianwalla Bagh...The second of which is a demonstration at a Salt Factory, ...<br />Gandhi is a triumphant picture, which preaches the power of the human spirit and the ability of non-violence to defy the tyrannical and bloodthirsty. Anchored by the brilliant performance of Kingsley, and with the assistance of two American icons in great supporting performances, Martin Sheen and Candice Bergman, as well as the two British legends Sir John Gielgud and Sir Johnny Mills, Gandhi is a feast of the human soul and a wonderful film for dreamers idealists, and lovers of good cinema.

B00003CXUM|4.0|This is an excellent film about betrayal and the love that emerges from it. Mr. Chow and his wife move into a room beside Mrs. Chan and her husband. Soon Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan discover that their spouses are having an affair. Mutual commiseration developes into a guarded love veiled in trepidation. Not since L'Avventura have I seen a movie so beautifully shot, and Maggie Cheung gives a performance that rivals Maria Falconetti's in the Passion of Joan of Arc.<br />In the packaging there is a comment from the director that they did have troubles with the censors. In a couple of places in the film the information seems incomplete so it would seem that some scenes may have been omitted or shortened. Someone who has more background on the film would know for certain.<br />All in all though a film that you will enjoy viewing after viewing.

0790736039|2.0|This film really bothers me. I read the book, loved it, and got pumped up for seeing the film. Unfortunately, it was painful to watch. It is nowhere near as good as I would have hoped. They rushed over everything, way to faast, and missed a lot of the point. There was stuff in there that simply did not make sense if you haven't read the book.<br />On top of that, they missed a lot of the point. A large portion of the book was about battling your mind. In the book, the silver bullet works, because they are using it on what their mind made look like a werewolf, and because they believed it would hurt him, it did! The same thing with Eddies aspirator, but the film did not bother to lay these things out. <br />Summed up, Grrrrrrrrrrrrr. Read the book a second time, or even a third. The film is poor!!
0871137380|4.0|The narrative in this novel did a superb job of immersing me in the drama of a particular military incident. Whether accurate or not, I got a good feel for the soldiers involved in this incident -- where they were coming from, what their concerns and desires were, how they performed under some crazy pressure -- and the processes involved in making the mission a success in name only. In a somewhat sterile fashion, the narrator took me through the hours building up and through our last major military mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. He also superficially explored the psyches of several combatants. But the greatness of the narrative lies in its pacing and subject material and not in its tendency to explore the human angle of the various characters. I was not sure if I needed to know about the families and histories of these guys. I just wanted to read about the action, the chain of events, the process by which American soldiers ended up in the largest firefight since the Vietnam War. And in fairness, the narrative accomplishes this job with great success. In my mind, however, the story would have been better served by using a more more technical, less humanistic framework to hang it on. But as a historical document and a testimonial for those who fought that day, Black Hawk Down serves its purposes well.

Thomas Stauch is like Mike Portnoy, he gets better with every album. And what more can be said about Hansi Kursch? Killer vocalist, and he really put a lot of work into his vocals here. \\"Precious Jerusalem\\" and \\"Battlefield\\" are a great way to get the album started, heavy and majestic. \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\" is one of their best ballads yet, and \\"And Then There Was Silence\\"? Oh man! I think we have a new candidate for \\"best song ever\\". It's just mindblowing! \\"Mies del Dolor\\" is really cool. It's all acoustic, and all in Spanish. Talk about a curve ball!<br />I could probably go on forever about this album, but I'd better stop now. This is just incredible, the best album of the year, even better than the new Dream Theater, and that's REALLY good! I'm not sure yet, but I may like this even better than \\"Nightfall\\". If you like Blind Guardian at all, buy this. It's just perfect.<br />PS: If you don't get it, don't review it. The fans know this is the stuff.
0380789035|4.0|There were several times early in the novel that I wanted to dislike the narrator. He waffled between vantage points and led me to one disjointed scene after another. The story, I felt, lacked polish. But by the half-way point I had gotten into the flow of the narrative and saw how these seemingly confusing literary devices worked toward an overall complete symmetry. Perhaps I can see the early pages as the climbing of a hill on a rollercoaster: loud and herky jerky. But once the ride --the story-- gets past a certain point there's no stopping it. It flowed like a rain-swelled river. The narrator had such a great command of language that even the most outlandish aspects of the story seemed natural to the process. I didn't notice many sharp edges in this tale. The only criticism I may have is that there are one or two instances where the narrator supplied me with a side story that I did not feel contributed to the overall landscape of the novel. Though I enjoyed them, I did not see them as necessary. But as a whole, I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of mythology and supernatural story-telling. I also think aspiring writers would do well to pay attention to Gaiman's style.<br />Roland Petalver
B00000IGGA|4.0|...do I realize that &quot;Mule Variations&quot; had some weaknesses.  Of course I loved this album when it came out, and I still do, and I only give it 4 stars, as one other reviewer put it, because Tom has set such an amazingly high standard for himself.  That's true.  <br />But while &quot;Mule Variations&quot; contains some brilliant, poignant songwriting, and a few of his best tunes (&quot;Come On Up To The House,&quot; &quot;Philipino Box Spring Hog,&quot; &quot;Picture In A Frame&quot;) it's marred by some bad production ideas, such as turntables and samplers, and the inclusion of Primus.  Tom's art is WAY out of Primus' league, and though they may be friends, Tom is better off leaving them to record their own material for now on.  There are times when the turntables are effective in a Portishead sort of way too, but on a song like &quot;Eyeball Kid&quot; the production masks what is essentially a void in good songwriting (very rare on a Waits album!), and I gotta say that songs like &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Get Behind the Mule&quot; just don't carry the same emotional/visceral weight that so many other great Waits classics do...but again this album would be a career HIGHLIGHT for anyone else!    <br />I was so glad to hear that Waits had jettisoned the distorted guitars and pop elements with his latest two offerings, because the man's voice seem so much more at home couched amidst bass clarinets, bassoons and calliope.  I think Tom's Waits-iness is captured on the latest two albums (&quot;Alice and &quot;Blood Money&quot;) in a definitive way that he's never quite equalled before.  How rare is that!?!?!?!  A musical artist who is at his MOST vital while in his 50s!  Wow.  And the voice just gets cooler with age.  <br />Tom is our greatest living American artist, and despite my complaints, this was one heck of an album.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The DVD version of Harry Potter was exactly what I expected it to be.  It was something that required concentration and a knowledge of what was happening in the untones of the movie to understand.  It truly followed the book.  The added scenes were fantastic and the photography was outstanding.  The second DVD.....I am having trouble getting through the mazes, but that is life.
0312932081|5.0|I read A LOT, and this is one of the best books I've read - EVER.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  I highly recommend this book.  I am going to read every book in this series and every book I can get my hands on by this author.<br />The hardcover has an interesting introduction that the paperback does not.  I read the intro after reading the story so as not to give anything away.<br />I give this book 100 stars!!!

B00005BL2A|1.0|I am a huge Depeche Mode fan!  I was anxiously waiting for this album to come out thinking that it would be something great.<BR>I ran out to buy this album the very first day that it was released in music stores only to be disappointed.  The is one of Depeche Mode's worst albums ever made along with their 1992 Songs of Faith and Devotion.  I was really disappointed and disillusioned by the quality of music and lyrics contained in Exciter.  Most of the songs are slow and boring and nothing like Depche Mode in terms of their musical uniqueness that they are known for.  Exciter is no match and can not even be compared to Depeche Mode's material during the Some Great Reward/Music For the Masses era that brought us the all time classics of Everything Counts, Blasphemous Rumours, People are People, Shake the Disease, Strangelove etc.   The closest that Depeche Mode has gotten to matching their eighties hits was with the above average Ultra Album from 1997.  The only decent and true Depeche Mode like song on Exciter is the Martin sung Comatose and to an extent The Dead of Night.  The rest of the album is a yawn that is sure to put you to sleep.  Despite this let down by the greatest band ever, I still love Depeche Mode!  When you compare Exciter to the atrocious  album of Songs of Faith and Devotion, Exciter is much more barable.
B000066NW0|5.0|I stumbled upon Avril Lavigne on accident. ... By chance I caught the premiere of Complicated. I went home that night and couldn't get the song out of my head. This cd is the type you can put in and listen to straight through. No skipping through the bad songs because there are no bad songs. Avril Lavigne has a voice like no other artist out there. She is amazing and the cd is awesome. Her music is honest and this is by far the best cd I have heard in a very long time. All I have to say is move over to all the female artists out there, because the real talent is finally here.
047158651X|1.0|I am a 2nd year medical student and last year I had to use this book for my medical biochem class...it stunk!  I found the book to be utterly boring, and in the second term I didn't even read the book anymore, I just concentrated on my NMS (Thats the best review book for clinical biochem, in my opinion) and on my in-class notes, and not only did I ace the class, but I got 90 on the national miniboard examination, where the national average was a mere 70.  If you want a great biochem book, look elsewhere...its not here.
B000066C1N|5.0|Okay, so I went with my 11y/o daughter to see this, I had heard Bryan Adams did the music with Zimmer on it, so I was eager to hear it..I was so touched by this movie, the music made it all the better!<BR>Bryan Adams and Zimmer did an outstanding job.  Bryan Adams really had the *feel* of this movie and Spirit. Excellent soundtrack, wonderful written songs.

B00005K3NR|5.0|Ok, we all know the plot to Carrie, some of us know the script word for word.  I have loved this movie since I first saw it in a movie theatre in 1976.<br />This is an excellent DVD for fans of this film.  The three documentary pieces, photo gallery, and other information are what I was waiting for (that I didn't have on the regular DVD).  All very interesting stuff.  But still wondering where Mr. Travolta was in the documentary interviews?<br />Things I would have liked to see on the DVD as well?  The deleted scenes - definitely.  I think the scenes of a younger Carrie and the stones falling should have been included in original cut of this movie (but an explanation IS provided in the 45 minute documentary of why it was abandoned), as well as all the other deleted scenes/behind-the-scenes section.  A third documentary with Stephen King and Tabitha King on the birth of the novel would have been better than the text version on-screen.<br />Perhaps a 30th Anniversary edition of Carrie on DVD in 2006?  An anniversary screening in the movie theaters in 2006 would be great too (with the deleted scenes added!)  I'd go twice.<br />Buy this Special Edition, it's worth it.

B00003CXXO|5.0|When I first saw this, I never blinked, and when I needed to go to the bathroom, I didn't. One of my ALL-TIME FAVORITES. It was a bit slow in the end, but by then I knew it was a fantasy and everything else in the movie made up for it BIG time. Speilberg did a fantastic job! Haley Joe Osment also did a fantastic job(I think he was even better than he was in \\"THE SIXTH SENSE\\"). Anyways, I came out of the theater fullfilled to the fullest. The special effects were great(A visual masterpiece!-through my eye), great acting, great score, and overall A.I.-Artificial Intelligence is a must-see film.
B00003CXI1|2.0|Not much of a fan of the science fiction/fantasy genre, an overseas flight offered me the opportunity to see what I had understood to be a delicious, imaginative story of an orphan finding himself. Instead, I found the creative elements to be more boring and mundane than exciting, the kids to be overly stereotyped, and the plot more banal than bodacious.<br />The story blends recycled elements of Dickens with Star Wars and Ben Hur only with tens of millions spent on 'special' effects. Expecting colorful characters, I found only silly characters dressed extravagantly drawn by aging  if not ancient English thespians. Fighting off sleep was more of a challenge than the twists of the tale. And the bits of terror are inappropriate for any child under age thirteen, unless you accept that young people need to have nightmares.<br />Thank goodness they didn't charge me for the headphones on the flight!
B00003CXA4|5.0|Born to be a classic! \\"GANDHI\\" is an amazing look into a seemingly ordinary person's life. Yet, when you hear and see of his travels and thoughts, you realize he isn't ordinary because he does extraordinary things. The great thing is how insightful and close this movie brings you to Gandhi's daily life and Ben Kigsley's emotions that he gives to his character bring you close to the pain Gandhi must have gone through. And also as I watched it on the DVD, I was inpired by, not the words Kingsley had learned from a script, but the words of Gandhi and his reasons for doing what he did.<BR>And as the movie ended, with tears in my eyes, I thought about what Albert Einstein said-\\"Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth\\", but I disagreed because I did believe with all my heart.<BR>I now believe Gandhi lives in all of us. But it still mystifies me how one man can be as fragile as anyone else and yet at the same time be almost as powerful as God himself.
014028009X|5.0|I thought that this book was quite good. I however found some similarities to a much older book. Maybe I'm wrong, but the story seems a little like a modern day Pride and Prejudice, but in a very innovative way. The heroin of this novel is not necessarily as strong minded as we would wish her to be, but at the same time, neither are we. We all go through our boughts of weakness and Bridget bounces back at every turn. This book is a delightful account of one woman's struggle with everyday life.
006092988X|5.0|This book is a wonderful treat, with a very poignant message to anyone who reads it. I think it's the perfect book for any pre-teen girl, and the lessons it teaches will stay with you forever.<BR>Every young girl should have this in her collection, to reflect on, and to grow with.
B00003CXXR|2.0|I figured I have seen the first two, I might as well see this one too. It is better than the second film, and about on par with the overrated first film.<br />Sam Neill is tricked into going to the second island by Tea Leoni and William H. Macy, who are looking for their missing son. A few supporting players go, too, to provide food for the dinosaurs without caring about the loss of their characters. There is lots of running, a climax that never happens, and the promise of another sequel.<br />Forgive the short synopsis, the truth is this film steals tons from the first two films. There is a &quot;dinosaur poop&quot; scene and a character supposedly dies and we must waste our time watching for him to appear hurt but alive.<br />I would compare this film to the awful &quot;Back to the Future Part II.&quot; It was also released to kind of tie in to future episodes, and does not stand well on its own. If you are going to continue a major action franchise, you would think the third film would be even bigger than the first two. No such luck here.<br />The special effects run hot and cold. Good dinosaur graphics, but what is with the script? The film makers decided the audience wants nothing but dinosaur attacks, and throws in all sorts of them. These do not seem to take on any sort of breakneck speed, this just looks like a resume tape for Stan Winston's special effects. This is a greatest hits compilation of people getting chased, attacked, and eaten (in all its PG-13 gory glory) without any sort of suspense or scares. Action scenes would start, like the dinosaur at the steel fence, then end as the humans would just run away, talk, then get chased again.<br />Would everyone stop teaming Sam Neill with children? The teenage boy here is better than the lovey dovey cutesy wutesey duo from the first film, but I am sick of seeing his heart melted by youth. Speaking of youth, I literally cannot remember anything about Neill's young protege, Billy. His character is so vacuousand laid back, he disappears from the screen. I kept thinking &quot;who is that? oh, yeah, Billy with the stolen raptor eggs.&quot; Macy and Leoni are okay, but better than this material.<br />If you have seen the first two, you might as well see this as well. It is not any good, but when has that stopped a major motion picture studio from shoving down your throats?<br />This is rated (PG13) for physical violence, some gun violence, gore, and profanity.
B000002GQL|4.0|Seventh Sojourn is an overlooked piece of The Moodies grand era, and their last really good album,when you good still call them psychedelic prog.Formulaic classic rock radio has forgotten gems like \\"You And Me\\",which were staples of FM rock airplay as late as the early 80's.I don't want to see their great music forgotten.Just pulled this record out again today and I still love it and The Moodies. God (and Goddess)Save The Mellotron!!!
6304428928|5.0|In the last few years, this was one of the few Oscar winners for best picture that was not a ponderous three hour history lesson.<br />Charlie Babbit, a struggling and cocky luxury car dealer finds out his father dies, and goes to Ohio from L.A. to collect his expected inheritance. He finds out he has an older autistic brother named Raymond who has all the money put in trust for his care. Charlie takes Raymond on a drive back to L.A. to await a hearing on custody of Raymond, and the film is, in effect, their cross country journey.<br />I have seen this film many times before, as have others, and I would suggest a new way to view this: just watch Tom Cruise's underappreciated performance. He is very confident and sure of himself, and holds his own against Hoffman. His character does change slightly throughout the film, but Cruise never allows Charlie to do a 180 into sainthood. Even at the climactic hearing, he speaks shortly to Raymond, and their final scene after the hearing, where Raymond leans his head on Charlie's, is wonderful.<br />Hoffman deserved the Oscar for best actor. Sure, everyone did their own Raymond impressions (until Tom Hanks' Forrest Gump came along; why do some people think mental retardation is funny?), but Hoffman has not been this good very often since (\\"Hero\\", anyone?).<br />The screenplay is wonderful, despite a troubled history and multiple endings. The one scene I had a problem with is when Charlie figures out who Raymond was to him as a child, and Levinson basically has Cruise talk to himself as a way to let those in the audience know. I cannot stand that. We can figure it out without Cruise mumbling \\"they sent you away because they thought you hurt me.\\" This is just quibbling, however, considering other positives here. Levinson uses overlapping dialogue to a wonderful extent, with Cruise always talking and trying to find a way out of a jam. His scene where he keeps repeating his inheritance, the rose bushes, to his father's lawyer, while the lawyer tries to talk, is funny and a foreshadowing to Hoffman's Raymond. Maybe Raymond does not say some of the things he says because he is autistic, but because he is a Babbit. When Robert Altman uses overlapping dialogue, it seems forced, boring, and something you must endure until Sally Kellerman or some other leading lady agrees to take her clothes off. Here, it is very natural. Valeria Golina is also good as Charlie's exasperated Italian girlfriend.<br />Hans Zimmer provides an incredible score that is not used often enough. The pick of songs, from Bananarama's remake of \\"Nathan Jones,\\" to \\"At Last\\" seemed to be collected to make the movie work, not because someone wanted a hit soundtrack a la \\"Footloose\\" or \\"Beverly Hills Cop.\\"<br />\\"Rain Man\\" is a great film, and one that deserves a fresh look today.<br />This is rated (R) for some physical violence, strong profanity, brief female nudity, some sexual content, and some sexual references. This could almost get a (PG13) nowadays, I have seen worse on network TV.
0671027344|5.0|This book made me cry harder than anything.  I fell in love with Charlie and the only bad thing about it was that it ends.  I reccomend this book to anyone and everyone.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see a new digital print of this film with a new Dolby soundtrack. The new sound rocks and is a major improvement over the Mono from before.<br />I'm not a big fan of Cameron as a director though. There are no huge comparisons between the terrifying Dark Future LA and the 1984 LA. As most scenes are shot at night in derelict parts of town the whole films looks miserable. It can also be so VERY, VERY 80's. Take a gander at the clothing and the music. The Technoir scene is a great example.<br />Arnie is super-cool as the emotionless cyborg who just blows everyone away WITHOUT grinning at the camera. Michael Beihn makes for a good hero and Linda Hamilton is just as good as Sarah Connor. But she became really annoying in the sequel. It's a shame Lance Henrikson isn't in it for long and Dick Miller has an amusing cameo.<br />It is quite scary in parts too. The steel exo-skeleton of the Terminator is not the kind of bad guy I'd wanna go up against and the visions of the robot war is rather ugly. Especially when we see the wheel crush up all the human skulls. Although it is quite unlikely that skulls would be piled up like that. Where are the rest of the bones?<br />The Terminator theme is very cool but the rest of Brad Fiedel's score is absolutely terrible. It's nothing but inaudible noise. The same applies for T2 and his score for True Lies. Has anyone apart from Cameron ever employed him?<br />Most of today's sci-fi is junk and quickly forgettable (Fifth Element, X-Men) but this has stood the test of time and will do for a long time to come, regardless of the 80's feel to it.<br />But Cameron made it in 1.85:1, which sucks. The second film, while not an improvement, is up to the same standard. See the new version of this movie if you can it's a great improvement over the older print.<br />The new DVD has a much cleaner anamorphic picture (Image previously released this in letterbox only and mono) and the 5.1 sound will give your system a good workout.workout.
6304211740|3.0|This movie is an ok movie to watch.  If you have read the book then you can see why I lowered teh rating.  This adaptation of the novel Jane Eyre leaves out primary parts.  This occurs especially in the beginning where you see practically only a minute of when she is at home with her aunt then she is fastily whisted off to Lowood.  The time she spends at Lowood is even shorter.  The relationship between Helen and Jane exceedingly lacking.  They hardly even know each other if you watched the movie and she cries and is depressed when she wasn't even really an intimate friend with her.  In the novel she was an intimate friend with her.  It makes a lot more sense in the book.  In the movie they hardly even have a relationship.  She's very fastily sent away and is even faster at Thornfield.  When they were at Lowood it was probably the most, according to the book, correct.  However,  they still take out one primary scene before they leave and when Rochester's wife comes into her room.  The acting was done very well but there was so little of the original novel.  If you haven't read the book then it would seem like a good movie but to people who have read the book they lacked many important things from the book.  The rest of it goes extremely fast and they take out many, many, many scenes.  The ending is good and it goes with the book.  As a whole, it wa Ok but not that good
B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet Special Edition is a nice addition for fans of the film.  The documentary is 70 minutes long and has a lot of current interview footage with Kyle, Isabella, Dennis and Laura edited together with older interview footage of David Lynch.  The attempt at showing us deleted scenes are interesting, but not great as they are still photos.  It is a beautiful transfer.  The widescreen presentation is the ONLY way to see it.  Having watched it on video for years, the widescreen DVD shows so much it is like watching a new movie.  Now maybe a version of Wild at Heart comparable to the Special Edition will be released on DVD!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't really listen to the radio much, but one day I did stumble on &quot;Complicated&quot; playing the airwaves.

0451205146|4.0|Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, by Mark Bowden, is an in-the-streets account of the now infamous seventh mission of Task Force Ranger and Delta Force in Mogadishu, Somalia. Militarily, the mission was a success; politically, it was a disaster.<br />Black Hawk Down was recently released as a major motion picture. I haven't (yet) seen the film, but even to those who have I strongly suggest reading this book. In addition to being made as a movie, an even earlier version of this book appeared as a series of articles in the Philadelphia Inquirer. Additionally, there is a \\"companion documentary\\" (Somalia: Good Intentions, Deadly Results), a shorter version of which has appeared on CNN. Of course, the most famous media related to this story is the news footage of the dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets by angry mobs; second to that would be the image of Black Hawk pilot Mike Durant's smashed face in the video made of him by his captors. Both of these are around; if you really need a reminder, try Google.<br />In the 1990's, the United States found itself in three separate conflicts in (at least partially) Muslim lands. The Gulf War was a conventional military venture, the UN missions in the former Yugoslavia represented a basic-albeit convoluted-peace-keeping venture. The nation-building force in Somalia after the initial famine-busting mission heavily involved special operations. The first sent ripples among the military theorists of nations across the world; the second involved the civilizationally odd American preference to support the Muslim community over that of Orthodox and Western forces; the third was seen as a victory of sorts by Third Worlders and Islamists who drew from it the lesson that America could be shocked into backing out of a conflict. Understanding each of these conflicts-militarily, politically, and culturally-is important to understanding this greater conflict we are now in. Black Hawk Down does much to shed light on thepersonal and tactical elements in the Somlian campaign's bloodiest battle.<br />While Mark Bowden is a journalist and is quite clear about saying he has no background or experience in combat tactics, covert operations, military strategy, etc., this book is very illuminating. Since the book's publication, Bowden has been invited to address the Military Operations Research Society, the U.S. Military Academy (West Point) the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (Ft. Leavenworth), and the Central Intelligence Agency. The book been personally recommended by the U.S. Marine Corps commandant and is part of the mandatory reading curriculum at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.<br />So how did this journalist write something that garnered so much respect among military professionals? Quite simply, he tells the soldiers' tales and he tells them straight. The political backdrop, the larger strategic military picture, the command decisions made outside of Mog-these he treats lightly and only as much as needed to provide context for the first-hand accounts of the Americans and Somalis that were actually there. This is a street-level, blow-by-blow narrative of some of the most intense combat American forces have faced since the Vietnam War, and nearly every word of it is drawn either from interviews with combatants, from transcripts of radio traffic, or from video footage shot by U.S. military personnel.<br />I read this book over Memorial Day weekend this year. It was extremely appropriate. Overall I really enjoyed this book and feel I've learned quite a bit from the experience. I had already read a shorter account of overlapping events-from the CIA perspective-written by Vernon Loeb for the Washington Post, titled \\"After Action Report\\", but this book fills in details that the other perspective lacked. (At the same time, I strongly recommend you read \\"After Action Report\\" as well.) I've heard criticisms of the film that said it was often hard to tell one character from another; I could say the same for the book. At the same time, the sense of confusion that sometimes creeps into the narrative is, in fact, a natural consequence of the fact that this is combat, as experienced by modern soldiers. By the time you complete the book, you'll have enough information to get a remarkably complete picture of the \\"Battle of the Black Sea\\"; while in the midst of it, though, you may well find yourself flipping back through the book to remind yourself which unit and which part of the city you are currently reading about.<br />All in all, this is a book well worth reading, and have added it to my Warblogger's Bookshelf. It is an insight into the terrible human experience of modern warfare, set within a significant series of events whose importance were not fully understood in their own time. If it were fiction, I'd say it was a brilliant, thrilling \\"page turner\\"; it, however, is not. It is the story of a handful of American soldiers who really lived and (some of them) died, often in stunningly heroic ways. To understand a part of what emboldened enemies such as Al Qaeda, to learn what modern unconventional combat can be like, to renew your faith in the courage and skill of the folks in America's armed forces, read this book.
031286504X|2.0|This is a story about the sole survivor of a plague that has turned the world's population into varying forms of vampires. While the idea behind the story itself is intriguing, it feels more like reading an anthropological study than a horror novel. The whole novel is filled with the protagonist repeating the same actions and his reactions to those actions over and over again.<br />There is little in the way of plot, rather the story plods along aimlessly. Matheson may have done this intentionally to convey the protagonist's uncertainty about the past, present, and future. Nonetheless, it makes for a less than gripping read.<br />Matheson's writing style is, at best, mediocre in this novel. I had to force myself to finish reading it. On the plus side though, it did have a good ending. If you're new to Matheson and must read something of his, pick up Hell House, a far superior novel.
B00005QAPH|5.0|Fellini's 8 1/2 is a gorgeous picture that, in 1963, must have floored audiences.  Too bad I wasn't alive then.

The transfer is tip-top and there's an interesting short film by Fellini.  Buy this DVD.
0440180295|5.0|How does one go about writing a review for Slaughterhouse Five? The genre can't even be defined (horror? comedy? war drama? sciene-fiction?), let alone the essence. What can be told about Slaughterhouse Five is that it makes the reader reconsider. It can easily change how one looks at war, peace, family life, aging, humanity and even the science fiction genre in one sitting. As thought provoking and entertaining as this is, perhaps the most endearing aspect of the book is the protagonist. Billy Pilgrim is easy to love because he is simply an exagerated form of the common man; observant, thoughtful, and destined to be bewildered by the world from the moment he entered it. The reader doesn't know what to make of Billy or his sitation, but he or she loves him nonetheless. In a way, it seems that this is how Vonnegut wants people to view his story - with a combination of sadness, confusion, and laughter.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I was a bit disappointed when I realized that there was nothing special about the DVD, but I could not make myself give it a 4 star rating because the movie is so good.  Make sure your television is set up for a proper picture (ie brightness isn't too high) and enjoy.
B00000JTB2|5.0|These are two of my favorite Blues Singers, unfortunatetly they are no longer with us.  As a result, I savor CD's like this which  bring back magic moments when they had the oppurtunity to play together.  This session is a fluid jam.  Two masters of the guitar feeling each other out.  Albert testing the young star, and Stevie paying homage to one of his heros.  The songs are mostly old standards, except for Stevie's anthem, &quot;Pride and Joy.&quot;  The delivery is bold and exciting.  An outstanding choice to remember two guitar greats.
B00006690F|4.0|This is one the sickest CD's ever! <BR>Other cool CD's to check out are Delusion by Quentin's Ladder & Amen by Hanna. Great music for bass.
0425152251|5.0|I just had to write a review for this book because it is my all-time favorite.  It's a perfect introduction to the history of philosophy, but it's not dry like most text books.  Instead, it is a story told through a child's eyes with a great plot line running through it.  It covers all the major philosophers.  My favorite aspect of this book is the fact that it ties all the philosopher's thoughts together, showing how each of them builds on previous philosophers.  It's easy to understand and a quick read.  For anyone interested in the history of philosophical thought and wants a brief over-view of major philosophers, let this book be first on your list.  If you have taken a few philosophy classes like I have, you'll want to read this book as well because it ties the subject together in one cohesive book.
B000063S6Z|1.0|This CD is a total let down. The beats are horrid. If you want to hear REAL electronic music, check out these titles:<BR>Delusion by Quentin's Ladder<BR>Amen by Hanna<BR>Project Human by Dieselboy<BR>Next Level Fusion by ILLFORM<BR>and<BR>Cybotron by Dillinga
0790729644|5.0|The whole idea of Unforgiven is exposing the myth.  Films are always fantasy and especially westerns.  Good over evil, hard work wins and the bad guy has to coming, are ideals we all love and live by.  But its nice to see a film, once in a while, that reminds us of reality.  Eastwood even says it just before he kills Little Bill.  All that aside, the bevy of stars are well directed and act wonderfully.
B00003CXI1|4.0|First off I want to say that I did enjoy this movie.  I saw it in the movie theater the week it came out and I now own the DVD.  I am a big fan of this series of books, and the movie takes the first book (which is probably going to be the hardest to make a movie) and did it very well.  This movie VERY easily could have put out some complete rubbish or horrid cartoon and relied on its built in audience, but the makers of this film instead went out and made a very good (not great) movie and stuck to the story in the book quite well.<br />However, the movie did have one flaw in my mind that really brings down the quality of the movie.  The story between Malfoy & Harry is barely told, I know that certain things end up not making it into a movie because of length, but I was surprised that they did SO little to build the primary theme of the series in the battle between Malfoy & Harry.  At the very least they could have added in the bit about the Wizards Duel, and adding a few more lines in a couple of places to give Harry good reason for his animosity for Malfoy.  Honestly in the hat scene Harry barely has any reason to not want to join the same house as Malfoy because they did almost nothing to build up his character by that point.<br />Overall, this is a good movie based on a very good book.  The quality of the movie especially considering it was the first really has me looking forward to the other movies based on the series to come.  You can tell allot of effort was put into bringing the book to this media, and the attention to detail pays off in a very entertaining movie worth seeing.  You do not need to be a child to enjoy this tale, if you havn't seen it yet go out and buy it or rent it today.  You won't be sorry.

B00003Q43A|2.0|This is the most ridiculous movie about patriotism in the history of the planet. Aliens do exist and have taken over the world. Only Will Smith can stop these slimy things with the help of Jeff Goldblum (who resembles my good friend Somitr). Check mate, alien terrorism has never been so terrifying. Explosions all over, but it takes about an hour to get to the action. Fire trucks, cars and people fly in the debris and a dog jumps away from fire just in time. Lucky pup! Will Smith fights the aliens with his jet and Jeff Goldblum takes away their invisible forcefield. How quick he is! The two men fly an alien spacecraft and go back to space to take out the mother spaceship. I was struggling to stay awake during this overblown, goofball movie. The President of the United States is played by Bill Pullman and he delivers one of the most cheesy speeches of all time. &quot;Because today is our independence day!&quot; He was talking to about a hundred people out of the whole country. It was terrible and if you want to see a real movie that deals with aliens, see &quot;The X-Files&quot; or &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind.&quot; Both of those contain logic and real actors.
0790744295|1.0|\\"Creepshow\\" is supposed to be Stephen King's tribute to the EC comic books he grew up on. However, his five stories for this anthology film are completely lacking in all but the most base level the wit, irony, and moral underpinnings that were a staple of that comic series.<BR>These stories are representive of only the absolute worst of the original comics such as \\"Tales From The Crypt\\" and \\"Vault Of Horror\\", the kind the editors ran when they faced a deadline and had nothing better to offer. They could have been devised by third-graders. None of them can be considered in the least bit frightening because of their predictability and laughable effects and costuming (unless you consider gore and gruesomeness in itself to be frightening, and there's plenty of that). True, the original EC comics could be gory, but the stories usually had more substance than the ones offered here.<BR>King's \\"The Crate\\", about a university professor who sees in the discovery of a crate containing a carnivorous beast from the arctic a means to do away with his shrewish wife, is probably the best of the five, but that certainly isn't saying much. If the EC comics offered stories as poor as the ones in this movie, they would have deserved their fate of being virtually banned. (Fortunately, they did not.)<BR>\\"Creepshow 2\\", the sequel, accomplishes the almost superhuman feat of being even worse than this one. This movie isn't even enjoyable as camp.<BR>A poor tribute to the EC comic line.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I have worn out my Sade's Greatest Hits CD and on the way to wearing out Lovers Rock.  Anyone who knows me knows that I love me some Sade.  The girl is bad.<br />In this live version she combines the old and the new and the live band and audience give it extra flavor.<br />I like the way Somebody Broke My Heart segues into As Good as the First Time. I always get my groove with Kiss of Life but the live version is just live.  I get up in the morning dancing to the live version with a salsa/reggae beat. And the old standard Smooth Operator is smoother than ever  This version is mellow, jazzy, and off the chain. The girl is live!
0142000655|4.0|Throughout East of Eden, John Steinbeck creates characters that are intriguing but pushes their personalities to the extreme ends of the spectrum of good and evil, making them difficult to relate to. Despite this, the characters' interactions and the history that they weave makes a compelling read. The parallel to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel is clear and at times, the familiar struggles of the \\"Cains\\" of the book provoke an empathy that the more angelic characters fail to stimulate. Even the evilest of characters such as Cathy, can be identified with more then the more moral characters, such as Adam, and, without a doubt, make for a more interesting read. Still, despite issues with characterization, the book pulls you into its world of interweaving stories and one quickly gets lost in trying to sort out the intricacies of relationships and human traits. Despite puzzling family history stories that will have you wondering about their exact significance to the rest of the book, the parallel themes of guilt and forgiveness tie the book together from beginning to end.

B00005OAIE|2.0|...perhaps because I am not a college age female pop fan. I agree with the reviewer who calls him a Backstreet Boy with a guitar. There is very evident musical talent, but it is lost amidst vapid lyrics and pop cliches. &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot; comes nowhere close to the kind of sensuality found in Dave Matthew's Band's &quot;Crash&quot; it seems trying to attain. I really liked &quot;No Such Thing&quot; when I first heard it, but it has lost its appeal with repeated listening. The rest of the CD just didn't appeal to me or really catch my attention. Hopefully John will continue to develop his songwriting skills to go along with his playing talent.
0767817478|2.0|No, this overblown epic from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin (the masterminds who made \\"Universal Soldier\\") have come up with the most disappointing monster movie of all time. Go-chila was never seen and when he finally appeared on screen, everybody watching this trash had fallen asleep. Matthew Broderick plays a scientist who discovers the new breed which is a cross between an alligator, a lizard and Andre the Giant. An ugly piece of cinema. Helicopters and jets can't stop the thing because they just blow up monumental buildings in New York instead. No aim! The creature chases the scientist and his friends and it's not funny. Little Godzilla babies run around making a mess of consession stands in Madison Square Garden. Bad mother for not teaching your children manners.  Bad director for making a slow boring movie that is just another \\"The Lost World: Jurassic Park\\" done worse. Japanese people should be ashamed of this movie that doesn't contain people running around waving their arms like maniacs screaming, \\"Godzilla!\\" But, I was doing that running out of the theaters with popcorn spewing out of my mouth.
6304712936|5.0|Even for those who do not appreciate classical music, they will enjoy this well-crafted speculative movie on the life of Scalieri and Mozart. While recent discoveries show that the speculation on Mozart's early death may be wrong, this movie is worth watching for so many reasons:<br />Excellent music, the scenes are shot on location in palaces and historic theatre halls and are extraordinarily filmed, the acting is truly good, and the story line holds from the beginning to the end. The drama is excellently portrayed as well,<br />The bonuses on the DVD are great, as well. You have a music only track of Mozart and Scalieri as well as a making of short movie. It contained some interesting information, but I wouldn't want to share too much.<br />If you're looking for an excellent movie to enjoy, this is a good one. I don't recommend it for the younger kids, though.

B00006690G|5.0|Marshall \\"Eminem\\" Mathers took the world by storm once his single \\"My Name Is\\" was released.   Some people looked at his style as eerie and twisted humor and others actually realized that he had skills.   Whatever the formula, people ate it up real quick and Eminem soon became a household name.  Yes, some of the press was from his controversial lyrics, but at the same time, his distinct style created a path for him to remain an artist for years to come.   On his 2nd disc, \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", Eminem definitely put himself on the map.   His 1st single \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" only created a small path for the CD's better songs like \\"The Way I Am\\", \\"I'm Back\\", \\"B Please 2\\", \\"Kill You\\", \\"Who Knew\\" and the CD's smash hit, \\"Stan\\" w/Dido.  After selling 1.7 million units in the 1st week of sales, no one could deny Eminem of his \\"status\\".   Many social groups came to speak out about his controversial lyrics and the haters were everywhere but that only made more people buy the CD.   That's what a lot of people that don't deal with music don't understand.  More press just adds to better record sales.  Before his 3rd disc was released, Eminem's group, D12, would go on to release a CD and because of the success of the singles \\"Purple Pills\\" and \\"Fight Music\\" the CD went on to go platinum.  He also appeared on and produced the song \\"Renagade\\" that was on Jay Z's \\"Blueprint\\" CD.   On his 3rd disc, \\"The Eminem Show\\", Eminem's displays a lot of the antics that he did on his previous 2 CDs.   However, this time is seems that Mr. Mathers is more about his business.   The songs aren't as playful as the songs on \\"The Marshall Mathers LP.   \\"White America\\" starts the CD off in pure Eminem fashion.   He plays off of the irony on how he has been successful in a world that he is not set up to be successful in.  Check the chorus out..  \\"I could be one of your kids\\", \\"Little Eric could look like this\\", \\"Erica loves my s...\\", I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get\\".   He sceams the words \\"White America\\" between each line.   The first single, \\"Without Me\\", does the same thing that \\"The Real Slim Shady\\" did for \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\".   It's not one of \\"The Eminem Show's\\" better songs but it gets the listener's attention enough to make you want to buy the CD.   The CD's best song in my opinion is definitely \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\".    This song allows Eminem to tell his side of the story about everything that has gone on between him and his mom.   It's as honest as he can get and his fans should be able to appreciate this track.   \\"I'm sorry Mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet\\".    This songs also allows you to see how everyday life is seen through Eminem's eyes.   The production is handled primarily by Eminem himself.    Dr. Dre produces 3 songs: \\"Business\\", \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\" w/Eminem's own daughter Hailie Jade and \\"Say What You Say\\", where Eminem and Dr. Dre rip \\"Mini-Me\\" (Jermaine Dupri) apart with each line.   Other noteworthy songs include \\"Square Dance\\", \\"When The Music Stops\\" w/D 12, \\"Sing For The Moment\\" and \\"Drips\\" w/Obie Trice from D 12.   This CD definitely displays Eminem's versatility.   Overall, any fan of Eminem's previous 2 CDs will enjoy \\"The Eminem Show\\".   It is definitely worth the price of admission.   <br />James' Top 5<br />1) Cleanin' Out My Closet<BR>2) Square Dance<BR>3) Sing For The Moment<BR>4) Say What You Say w/Dr. Dre<BR>5) Drips w/Obie Trice of D 12
B00005RYL9|5.0|No matter what the Amazon description says, this is one of the best stories ever brought to DVD. The Immortal Edition is great; however, if you already own the Director's Cut, save your money and burn the music. Amazon's description of dizzying filmography and hard to follow story are out of line, this movie rocks!!
0783232039|1.0|I hated this movie so much, I wanted to pour hot spices into my eyes. \\"Bride of Chucky\\" is the worst thing to have ever been created and I'm sorry that I even watched a couple seconds of it. Chucky comes back to kill his girlfriend and performs a voodoo ritual to put her soul in a doll. They make quite the couple and I got quite the migraine! Two dolls in love, enough said. There aren't any big names in this movie and I don't know why John Ritter made an appearance in this bubbling waste! The deaths are gruesome and unbelievable. The dialogue is so bad, I thought I was watching \\"Blue's Clues\\". But, \\"Blue's Clues\\" is way better and Steve makes this look like the hell. Please don't ever make another movie with dolls again. No more torture.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I've read most of the reviews of the film and there seem to be two distinct camps. The first camp rants and raves about the philosophical implications of the dialogue, while the second group dismisses the dialogue as \\"sophomoric\\", \\"pop-culture cliche\\", or just plain moronic banter. I, as the other two camps, was deeply surprised by the originality of the film via its visual presentation. But, unlike most of the viewers i think the real crux of the film doesn't lie in the individual nature of each dialogue, but rather the sum and the spectrum of the ideas that are presented. Sure, most of us have heard bits and pieces of every idea presented in the movie, but most of us have never went beyond that fringe superficial information that was given to us. This movie offers simple yet concise previews of the positive aspects of existentialism, the metaphysical aspects of the dream vs. the lucid state, the evolution of humanity as a whole, fringe political ramblings, and many other motifs that I've forgotten. I would never say that these ideas are ground breaking or have profound implications, that's because most of them are not of a novel nature and have been stated and discussed long before this movie ever came out. But the thing that makes this movie so enjoyable is the way in which these thoughts are presented, the rhetoric is superb and i found myself totally immersed in each scene. If you're a \\"hardcore\\" philosopher try not to scoff at the ideas that are presented and if you're an average Joe, don't be too enthralled with their \\"novel\\" nature, but both of you should enjoy the visual aspect of this film...:)
0897500482|4.0|Tao of Jeet Kune Do is made up of notes written by Bruce Lee during 1970 while he was stuck in bed for six months with a hurt back. Also included are sketches drawn by Bruce to show different stances, attacks, takedown methods, etc. It must be known the book is not for those who just want to be able to beat people up. There are many proverbs included in the story and it challenges you to think and exercise your brain just as much as it challenges you to exercise your body. These proverbs could also be a downside for those with a lesser understanding of things because some of them could seem very confusing, or they may mislead people into getting a different meaning than what is meant to be given from them. Tao of Jeet Kune Do was not originally meant to be a book, but instead a collection of notes, so the information is sort of cluttered around. Included are suggestions on exercise, diet, stretching, attitude, and of course, self defense and attack. For those who study other forms of martial arts, almost all of the ideas behind Jeet Kune Do can be incorporated with these styles. Even if you don't use the book to train yourself it can be a very helpful tool in understanding how Bruce Lee thought and fought, and you can get a grasp of how Bruce Lee trained himself to accomplish all the great things he did. Overall, I thought it was a very enlightening book, and the only downside was the cluttering of the information, which was easily ignorable by the great content, and the confusing proverbs, which may have just been confusing to me, and could be easily understood by someone else.

B00004WGAI|4.0|I think this was an excellant movie, much better than the A&E version. That was a good movie, but if it wasn't called Jane Eyre you wouldn't be able to tell that what it was supposed to be. It was completely off the story line. This actually has paragraphs of dialogue taken from the book and it has more of the characters than the other one did. I have been looking for this version for quite some time and have been unable to find it. I only gave it 4 stars though because the only way it could be perfect, is to completely copy from the book. If it was one of those long 2 or 3 tape movies, and it included all of the words and characters from the book, I would give it 10 stars...
0767802519|5.0|Luc Besson's touching tale of a hitman and a young lady touches all of the bases for a great action film and a humane look at friendship. Jean Reno plays Leon the hitman who looks like a silly,  man who has no intelligence. Well, that is partly true due to illiteracy. His neighbor in the shallow apartment building which he resides has just witnessed the murders of her family. He takes the young Matilda (way too cute Natalie Portman) and they build a father-daughter relationship that they never had. I was crying so hard when Matilda dressed up and Leon had to play charades with her. It was heartfelt, tears rolling down my face. When corrupt police officers looked for them, he decided to wipe out all of them. Toughage! He was at the top of his doorframe and hung upside-down to blow them away. Yes! Even his plant made it through the massacre. But, the ending is devastating and will leave you in a crying coma for months. Natalie Portman had to go on without Leon and she lived off of twenty dollars. How resourceful! I loved this movie and everything about it. Gary Oldman is the ultimate evil spirit and he is always good. Natalie Portman became Queen Amidala in that one franchise and Jean Reno is the coolest thing since Antarctica! Loveage!
B000067DNC|5.0|Season 1 of Stargate was their \\"tryouts\\". They did well in a lot of places, slipped up a little, but eventually were allowed on the team.<br />Season 2 is where Stargate finds its legs and really begins to get interesting. I live in Australia, and have had all of Season 2 since last year, so I can review this...<br />The Serpent's Lair -  Very cool episode, great way to start a season.<br />In the Line of Duty - BIG episode. Sets up many future events.<br />Prisoners - Interesting episode with consequences that reach into Season 3.<br />The Gamekeeper - Before there was The Matrix, there was The Gamekeepers World, although this one is more traumatizing!<br />Need - Michael Shanks, who plays Daniel Jackson, really shines in this one. That guy can act!<br />Thor's Chariot - Follow up to Season 1's \\"Thor's Hammer\\" and the introduction of the true Asgard, a very important race. Excellent ep too.<br />Message in a Bottle - Maybe not the greatest ep in the world, but has a great suspenceful begining.<br />Family - More with Teal'c family.<br />Secrets - Another big ep with far reaching consequences, even in Season 5 & 6!<br />Bane - More Colonel Mayborne antics! <br />The Tok'ra Part 1, The Tok'ra Part 2 - Important, if not terribly interesting eps.<br />Spirits - Quite a funny ep. Sees Captain Carter in command for the first time.<br />Touchstone - More Colonel Mayborne antics!<br />A Matter of Time - Very cool ep, introduces series semi-regular Major Paul Davis, played by Colin Cunningham<br />The Fifth Race - Another biggie as far as plot arcs go<br />Serpent's Song - The death of a great adversary!<br />Holiday - Funny ep. Quite nice with Shank's acting again coming out on top, and not just as Daniel Jackson this time!<br />One False Step - Interesting plot, great Jack/Daniel interaction<br />Show and Tell - Although the writers haven't latched onto this plot thread since, it's a great set up and a great episode<br />1969 - Time Travelling SG-1!!<br />Out of Mind - You'll never guess who shows up this time around. A great set up for Season 3's \\"Into the Fire\\" season opener!<br />Get this Boxed set, even if it's just to avoid having to buy the DVD's from the UK (which cost almost twice as much).<br />BYE
6305513406|5.0|I only recently got into watching reruns of the Star Trek: the original series.   I am not a real trekkie at all though.  I don't like any other Star Trek series but the original and I would not be caught dead at a convention.  I simply like to watch the original series because it is a fun tv show to watch.  It generally had a well developed plot, colorful characters, and quite often was down right hilarious.  It's a true piece of good tv from the 60's.<br />The First episode here saved the series from never making it on the air.  WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE was the second pilot after NBC rejected THE CAGE (which never aired on tv).  A rough line up of the original crew appears here.  Capt. Kirk, Spock, Sulu and Scotty all appear here but Bones McCoy and the others would not appear until later in the series.  The episode finds the Enterprise travelling through a mysterious and infamous energy barrier.  As they travel through the bizarre barrier it begins to take affect on the ships crew particularily Kirk's good friend Lt. Gary Mitchell (Gary Lockwood) and Dr. Elizabeth Dehner (played by Sally Kellerman who later played Hotlips in the MASH movie).  Soon Mitchell becomes extraordinarily powerful and begins to influence Dehner.  Not long after that Spock tells Kirk that he will have to kill Mitchell in order to save the galaxy from utter destruction.  Kirk finds himself stuck between saving the galaxy and the trust of a friend.  Truly a dramatic episode especially for a pilot.<br />The second episode here is THE CORBOMITE MANUEVER.  This epsisode is famous because of the infamous face of Balok.  The Enterprise is travelling through unknown regions of space when they come across a bizarre cube like   alien space buoy.  When the ship's phasers destroy the object an alien ship named the Fesarius immidiately traps the Enterprise and it's crew.  After trying to reason with the skeleton alien named Balok who threatens the Enterprise that it will be destroyed, Kirk bluffs by making up \\"the corbomite manuever\\" story.  Balok believes Kirk and decided to tow the ship across space rather than destroy it.  The crew attempts to break free of the Fesarius' tractor beam and in the process disables the alien ship.  After they beam aboard the Fesarius they meet the true suprising form of Balok and make a new space ally.<br />The two episodes are classic but I agree with the majority of reviewers here.  2 episodes on one DVD!  Paramount could have easily released them season for season like the Next Generation rather than putting out 40 DVDS with onyly 2 episodes each.  Other than that I highly recommend this DVD if you like the Star Trek Original Series.
0792844890|3.0|For a Mel Brooks film, SPACEBALLS is not one of his best work but it is notable as one of the only major feature films spoofing Star  Wars. There is HARDWARE WARS, but it only makes its way at fan and comic book conventions and filler material on cable etc... Perhaps if the Zucker Brothers had done the spoof, it would have been funnier and raunchier.  However, SPACEBALLS has its moments such as the inspired Pizza the Hut (Jabba the Hut in pepperoni and mozzarella drag) played by Dom Deluise and John Hurt reprising his role from ALIEN complete with replaying the classic scene from the film in which the \\"Alien\\" explodes out of his chest.  However, Rick Moranis' Dark Helmet (Darth Vader), and the late John Candy's Barf the Mawg (Chewbacca?) are not very clever and carry much of the films' forced humor.  Bill Pullman again shows his versatility as an actor in one of his early film roles playing Lone Starr (a character combination of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo) and the rest of the cast of veteran character actors and some new faces do a pretty good job with a weak script and story. Hoewever, there seems to be something missing and there were more special effects in this movie than laughs.

0800177177|5.0|Bram Stoker's most popular novel has been made by the 'Godfather' man and contains the weirdest cast assembled on screen to date. Gary Oldman as the Count and Winona Ryder as the woman. Anthony Hopkins as the Professor Wesling and Keanu Reeves as the woman's fiancee. Oldman makes the weirdest noises when he laughs and Keanu Reeves is comical yelling, &quot;I've been chased by bloody wolves into some blue inferno!&quot; Ability! Anthony Hopkins is always good, but is more gruesome than Hannibal Lector in this movie. He chops off witches' heads and throws them off of a cliff. Grotesque! Gore and more gore in this movie, I was astounded by the performances regardless of the amount of blood shed. I felt like drinking some wine after watching this movie. Oh yeah, did you see the eyes in the sky while Reeves was traveling to Transylvania? Pure delight! The special effects were amazing when the men chased Count Dracula's carriage back to the castle. YES! Then Dracula popped out of the carriage just to get stabbed in the throat. How sneaky of those men! This movie is truly a masterpiece and I wanted to eat some toasted bread after watching it. It reminded me of one breakfast when I was just a toddler, I brought some jelly out of the fridge and started to spread it on my bread, but it spilled on my shirt! That memory was brought back after I saw all of the messes the witches and Dracula had made after attacking their victims. But, seriously, the film was pure maniacal and had an exquisite look which stands out from other versions of this classic novel. Oh, the humanity!
B00004T8RK|5.0|What is very very cool with the later pearl Jam albums is that they have a rough edge to them. What I mean is that todays artists work with their songs till every soundeffect sounds perfect! Binaural is no exeption and I am proud of them! <br />The best track on the album is Light Years, followed by Insignificance, Thin Air and Nothing as it seems which sounds incredible on the DVD! Cant wait for the new one to come out!
6303168507|5.0|Any way you stack it, Steven Spielberg's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST is one of the most important and enlightening films ever made. It is a heartfelt, deeply personal film about one of the ghastliest events in human history--the Holocaust--and how one man, a Nazi profiteer by the name of Oskar Schindler, while motivated by money, managed to save some 1200 Jews from the gas chambers of Auschwitz during World War II.<br />Spielberg wisely does not gloss over the fact that Schindler was every bit the womanizer as he was an astute, cagey businessman who made deals with the Nazis to set up an enamelware factory in the Cracow ghetto and employ the Jewish populace there. But his very trusted secretary Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) manages to awaken a latent spark of humanity in the once cold-blooded Schindler. By the time the war is over and the facts are known about the Nazi atrocities, Schindler is financially broke but spiritually enriched. \\"He who saves one life saves the world entire.\\"<br />Filmed in somber, documentary-like black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski, SCHINDLER'S LIST features superb performances by Neeson and Kingsley, as well as British actor Ralph Fiennes as the extraordinarily chilling Nazi commandant Amon Goeth, whose basic senses of Nazi business Schindler must appeal to while keeping the fact that he is sheltering the Jews a secret. Spielberg spares nothing in showing us the horrors of the Nazis barbarism; and although it is, not surprisingly, a very lengthy film (three hours and ten minutes), a lot happens for us to absorb, so it never becomes ponderous or heavy-handed.<br />Winner of seven Oscars, including a Best Director nod to Spielberg that was long overdue, SCHINDLER'S LIST shows us the worst in humanity, but also the best as well. Even in so much pain and death, there is hope. And that is why this film is such a masterpiece.
0887307396|3.0|As I dutifully plow through the currently popular business books - and I read only the ones that I need rather than for pleasure - I occasionally find a good and (fairly) interesting one.  This is one of those books I would recommend.  Instead of overflowing with ridiculously florid rhetoric about recycled banalities and excitement that is simply not justified, this book is based on solid research and is not afraid to offer un-spectacular advice.<br />It is about what the authors call \\"visionary companies,\\" which stand for something beyond just making money and yet are profitable.  They do well, and they do good.  There is no doubt that such companies exist, which I admit in spite of my boredom and cynicism regarding most of the businessmen and \\"business intellectuals\\" that I deal with as a writer.<br />Set up like an academic study, the book is a synthesis of the authors' findings while taking a long historical view of consistently excellent (i.e. \\"visionary\\") companies like H-P, Merck, and P&amp;G.<br />Not surprisingly, these companies do similar things:  1) they have visions and value that they try to uphold consistently throughout the company and to which they stay true over decades; 2) the set incredibly ambitious (and in retrospect realistic) goals that inspire their employees (&quot;big hairy ambitious goals&quot;); 3) they are cult-like in their beliefs in themselves; 4) they allow for trial and error, which lead to \\"evolutionary progress\\"; 5) they hire leadership from within; 6) they cultivate keeping their employees a bit off-balance (\\"uncomfortable\\") as a way of getting them to perform at their best; 7) they make sure that all elements work in concert and are internally consistent and self-reinforcing (&quot;alignment&quot;).<br />That is it for the ideas, which are far more nuanced than the above paragraph.  They could be summarized in one chapter, and the rest of the book is repetition and analysis by example.  The examples are interesting and informative and the ideas, which have all been said before, are good to review in a systematic way.  Very good.<br />These are good and useful ideas, if somewhat banal.  But then, doing business is rather dull for the most part - there are very few exciting companies out there, but most of them are like horribly dysfunctional families.  This is the authors' bid to explain the good few.<br />The tone of the book is rather modest, but the authors do get a bit too wordy and chummy in many instances.

B00005YU1O|5.0|I won't waste time critiquing parts of this movie.  Suffice to say I loved the whole thing.  I've never seen Rotoscoping done so well, it's a far cry from Ralph Bakshi's use of it.  The lack of a plot did not bother me.  The thrust of the movie is to live in the moment, totally experience it, so where it was going did not concern me.  There actually was a plot, just a very straight forward one.  I won't give it away though.  The dialoug was wonderful--the insights into life, death and dreams very profound.  I bought the DVD so I could watch it again and again to pick up what I missed.  Watch this movie when you can totally devote you attention to it.  I loved how they worked in clips from other famous movies, ie Dreams by Akira Kursawa, etc....
0060930187|5.0|I found The Bell Jar to be very interesting and informative.  Thought I do not suffer from depression myself, I know many who do.  After reading the book, I truly feel that I have a better understanding of the disorder.  I do think that it was a depressing book, but I was fascinated by Esther's thought processes and how she interpreted situations.  It's interesting to learn about the way other people think.

B00001IVOR|5.0|This has to be the best Wu-Tang Album after 36 Chambers only because 36 chambers shook up the rap game. Where as though Wu-Tang Forever just put itself in classic mode...<br />The lyrics and beats are all Wu-Tang...there is not much of an influence it seems from the likes of Ruff Ryders, or Timbaland and his techno beats...<br />Wonderful album...<br />Point Blank...
B00002E233|2.0|Ill admit this movie isnt the worst I've seen.  But this was so unreal its not even funny.  Everyone I know told me to see this movie, they said it was so cool.  So I did, I ended up laughing at most it.  Most of deaths were pretty cheesey looking (pixelated).  And no matter how smart a shark may be, they will never be able to swim backwards.  however LL cool J is entertaining.  A rental at most or buy it used.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril Lavigne (it's pronounced LAVEEN) is the newest, coolest chick with a guitar since Michelle Branch.  She's got wonderful vocals, amazing charisma, and she writes her own stuff.  What could possibly be better?  She's got a wide range of sounds(from punk rock, to hard rock, to pop rock, she covers just about all of it) and she does it so well!<br />1)Losing Grip -5/5- I LOVE this song. It's one of Avril's darker, heavier songs that deals with the woes of rejection.  Wonderful.<br />2)Complicated -4/5- Avril's first single off the album.  It's catchy and popish, and it's a good way to get started off.  Basically, it talks about posers and people who try to pretend to be something they're not.<br />3)Sk8er Boi -3/4- An ok song, it sounds really American Hi-Fi-ish.  It's more punk rock than anything else, and it' message is really cute.  It's about a preppy girl who turns down a skater boy, only to regret it later when he's a famous musician.<br />4)I'm With You -6/5- In my opinion, this is the BEST song on the album.  The lyrics and music are beautifully written, and the first time I ever heard it I thought it was totally poignant and moving with a sad sort of message about looking for somebody to love.<br />5)Mobile -3/5- Not really one of my favorites, but I like it nonetheless.  It's a metaphoric song about how being in the entertainment business forces you to move around a lot.<br />6)Unwanted -5/5- One of my top 3 favorite songs.  Mood wise, it slightly resembles \\"Losing Grip\\" in that darker sort of way.  The themes are basically the same too, they're about being rejected.  I love it.<br />7)Tomorrow -5/5- Another great song.  It's a little more on the mellow side, with a wonderful guitar melody and smart, poignant lyrics.  Great.<br />8)Anything But Ordinary -3/5- In this song Avril talks about how she loves to feel the danger of driving too fast because it makes her life feel worth while.  Again, it's not one of my favorites, but it doesn't make it a bad song, either.<br />9)Things I'll Never Say -3/5- I don't listen to this song very often, it doesn't really appeal to me.  It basically talks about how Avril is totally in love with some guy and wishes he'd do all these things for her, things that she'll never ask for out loud.<br />10)My World -4/5- My World is a very, very cute song!  It talks about Avril's childhood/early years (oh, and also her impossible hair) in Napanee, her hometown in Canada.  With pretty vocals and a catchy chorus, it talks about Avril's tendencies to space out and daydream.<br />11)Nobody's Fool -2/5- Okay, so I really wasn't feeling the whole \\"white girl rap\\" that Avril attempted in this song, but I didn't completely dislike it either.  In this upbeat song, Avril talks about how she'll always remain true to herself and she won't let anyone change her.<br />12)Too Much To Ask -3/5- This song talks about some loser guy Avril must have dated at one point or another. She talks about him choosing weed over her and all the other stupid decisions he made.  It's not a bad song, but not one that I personally prefer either.<br />13)Naked -5/5- I adore this one, it's definately one of the best. It's a little more mellow and slightly resembles Alanis Morissette's \\"Head over Feet\\" (just a little).  It talks about how when you're around the right kind of person they can make you expose parts of your emotional self that you never thought you would before.<br />All in all I think that Avril has more hits than misses on her new album, and I think she's on her way to major stardom!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The classic fable \\"never judge a book by its cover.\\"  A good lesson for people of all ages.  There is both humor along with the moral though and it is very funny however there are a few references that you will be thankful that your kids don't understand.  This is a great one for Mike Myers and it is also the best Eddie Murphey movie in a long while.  So allI can say is <BR>GO DONKEY AND GO SHREK!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is absolutley charming. It is pure romance, stylized, imnaginative, playful, sparkling. It will only get better in time. This is truly a DVD to own as a destined classic. Enjoy!
0679409920|4.0|Greene divided his novels into serious works such as The Power And The Glory and &quot;entertainments&quot; such as This Gun For Hire or The Confidential Agent written for popular audiences. The Human Factor belongs in the second category. Fans of Le Carre and Frederic Forsyth will enjoy it as much as I did, but someone who has never read Greene before should not expect anything more than a well-written airport bookstore novel.
B000021YQV|5.0|One day early last summer I was driving home from work and I heard this incredible song.  It was fast and furious one minute, then slow and ballad-like the next but was entirely compelling the whole time.  I rarely love songs the first time hearing them, but Chop Suey! was one of the few exceptions to this rule.<br />Toxicity has a lot more to offer than its first single, Chop Suey! and its radio-favored title track, although both are great songs.  The album ranges from the overtly political (despite what the band says) in &quot;Prison Song&quot; to the purely entertaining &quot;Bounce.&quot;  Some tracks, such as &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Forest&quot; are strangely melodic.  Others, like &quot;Prison Song&quot; and &quot;X&quot; are heavier on the shouting than the singing, but still without being obnoxious.  Most are a combination of the two ends of the spectrum, as seen in &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; &quot;Psycho,&quot; and &quot;Deer Dance.&quot;<br />My personal favorites are &quot;Aerials&quot; for not just the radio-friendly melody but for the obvious intensity with which lead singer Serj Tankian sings the lyrics.  &quot;Psycho&quot; is another favorite of mine, if for no other reason than the interesting subject matter-coke addicted groupies.  Finally, the short and sweet fast-paced &quot;Shimmy&quot; makes the list for pure entertainment value, while still managing to be at least borderline political.<br />Hard rock is finally out and available to the masses, and no rock lover's CD collection would be complete without this album.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I think it does a very good job of retelling the books I mean they practically take the chapters word for word.  Harry Potter also provides some wonderful cameo roles for 2 very fine english actors namly Allien Rickmen and John C(from Monty Python).  It suffers from from only one thing the kids sound like they are reading from the script of a middle school play.  It is not really an issue for your kids, and you will probably be too busy paying attention to the special effects to notice.
B000002GWN|5.0|The first song I ever heard from this album back in '74 was A Case Of You. That was all it took for me to leap out and buy it (on double vinyl). That such an exquisite song could be even improved upon was inconceivable to me. Yet Joni did it with the 'live' version recorded here.<br />In almost every case the songs are fresher and more vibrant than the originals - Cactus Tree from her first album being a good example. The sound quality throughout is astonishingly good, making Miles Of Aisles one of the best 'live' albums of all time, and as a double length CD, the value is just out of control.<br />If you have heard a lot about Joni Mitchell but never really heard much of her material, this album would be a wonderful entry point to her work.<br />An absolute classic.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I first heard John Mayer backstage during a choatic performance.  His lyrics were soothing and inspired.  His talent on the guitar is obviously poured from the heart, and his background and intrest in jazz creates a unique new blend to songs - such as &quot;Neon&quot;.  John's music is true talent that is rare.  Other favorites: &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot; (not on this CD)

0679428887|5.0|When \\"Fluke\\" Celtow an American reporter first hears the ravings of the old russian he is skeptical.  But the more he considers the old man's story the more he is intriged.  It is a mystery that goes back to the time of Stalin's death and its implications are vast.<br />My Imprezsion-I liked the book but there are a few fatal flaws the most major of which is the fact that towards the end they wrap everything up to neatly.  The idea of Stalin having a son who could carry on his \\"leagecy\\" is crazy but spellbinding.
0441009425|2.0|I was attracted to this book because the synopsis promised something like Jack McDevitt's books, a science-fiction archaeological mystery that resonates into the present day. And that is what Reynolds provides - but his tale has none of the depth or humanity that characterises McDevitt's stories. I kept waiting for this story to add up to something, but it never did. It was a meaningless parade of events related in a flat style of writing. Reynolds has imagination, true; but that imagination is limited to settings and a few plot points, and does not extend to characters or any fresh insights. His lack of skill in bringing his characters to life is the worst aspect of this book. They are cardboard cutouts completely lacking in depth, mere fronts for the next plot twist. And Sylveste, the main character, is so devoid of life, his actions so inexplicable, that one cannot understand why he was so important or caused so much upheaval.<BR>If this is Reynolds' first book, he does have some good foundations to build upon - but there's a long way to go. The destination was meaningless and the journey unpleasant. Overrated.
6305558167|4.0|This is a well-done, if graphic, telling of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, with a supporting cast that's even more stellar than the main players.  This adaptation goes all the way back to the last days of Arthur's father, Luther Pendragon (smartly played by Gabriel Byrne), and how Arthur was born, which not many may know about.  King Arthur's life is portrayed with elaborate drama and many brutally violent sequences in this film, but then again, that's the way the legend goes.<BR>The best part of this movie lies in its cast, with some now-famous faces dotting the screen.  Patrick Stewart and Liam Neeson turn in excellent performances as Arthur's fellow knights, and Nicol Williamson (last seen as Cogliostro in \\"Spawn\\") makes both a scary and hilarious Merlin.<BR>The special effects are a little on the cheesy side, but not bad for a film that's over thirty years old.  The acting was a tad overdone for my taste as well, but I think the director was going for a dramatic a telling as possible...as if the viewer was reading it out of a storybook.  To each his own, I suppose.  <BR>Regardless of familiarity with the story of King Arthur, I would recommend \\"Excalibur\\" as a better-than-average action film with a superior cast...just bring a lunch, for this story's a long one (2 hrs, 20 min!).  Don't worry, though, your attention will be sufficiently held.
B0000028VT|5.0|I love this CD. I listen to it all the time. It contains so many terrific songs. For example, &quot;Dreamlover&quot; is one of Mariah's best songs ever. It is bouncy, catchy, and fun. &quot;Hero&quot;, well the song is fabulous. It is a beautiful ballad written by Mariah and the song is strong enough to put some good feelings into your heart. Mariah's version of &quot;Without You&quot; is way better than Nilson's version. I don;t like the sound of Nilson's voice in that song. It sounds a little bland compared to Mariah's version.<BR>&quot;Anytime You Need a friend&quot; is such a feel good song. It really  puts warth in your heart. &quot;Music Box&quot; was never one of Mariah's greatest hits but I think the song is better than some of her greatest hits. Its such a powerful song. The other songs are great too. Great CD, you should definately buy it.
B00005O3VC|5.0|To those who do not like this film I say STUFF IT...<BR>This movie is a masterpieace of British Comedy.  There are wonderful and unforgettable lines like \\"Bring out your dead\\" and \\"The knights who say nee\\".  It is loaded to the gills with humor and wit from the genius minds that brought you classics like \\"The Life of Brian\\" and \\"A Fish called Wanda\\".  That is just the movie itself now with the DVD you have a whole new level added to the experience.
B000062XFG|5.0|I was impressed at the quality of the picture since these shows were from the late 80's and the only problem I found was with the sound that seemed a bit low from my DVD player . All in all I was satisfied with my purchase for the first two seasons of Star Trek TNG. I look forward to completing my collection on Amazon. com.
0345413377|5.0|Having just finished reading The Amber Spyglass, I can honestly say that I am not completely satisfied. This trilogy had so much potential after The Subtle Knife, but in The Amber Spyglass, everything that I thought was going to be explained wasn't explained. Thinking back, I can find no real connection between the first book and the third.<br />In The Amber Spyglass, the theme is clearly anti-Christian, which is surprising and a little sad. I have never called myself a religious person, but to see such a beautiful book marred by such horrible claims saying that God was a tyrant, and organized religion is bad, and there is no real authority/creator holding everything together, disappointed me. I greatly disliked the depiction of God as a mumbling old angel. I also found it hard to pick out the protagonists and the antagonists in this book, since everyone seemed rather evil and selfish. Mrs. Coulter was an entirely unbelievable character, as was Lord Asriel. Their motives were unclear, and it was impossible to tell whether they were lying or not. And I was given no logical reason as to why I should hate the Authority or Metatron, so I couldn't quite call them the villains either.<br />However, despite the many criticisms I have of The Amber Spyglass, I still gave it 5 stars. This is because it was a wonderfully written book, and I loved reading it just as I loved reading the first two. The story of Mary Malone and the mulefa was especially good, and the Land of the Dead was an interesting addition. The end of the book was sad (in fact I've never read a book that made me cry more), but hopeful.<br />Despite my conflicting viewpoints, I would read this book again if the mood took me, and I would recommend it to those who have read the first two books and want to finish the trilogy. But don't look forward to any mind-blowing ending and surprising answers to all the questions, because you won't get them. Instead, you'll get a lovely story beautifully told, and a nice good cry at the end.ood cry at the end.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I've read all four volumes of the Harry Potter series to date after seeing the movie in the theatre on the big screen.  Couldn't wait for the DVD and I am thrilled with it.  While, admittedly, the movie lacks some of the details and changes a little from the book, I found it enchanting and about as true to the book as can be expected given time limits and translating words into a visual presentation.  John William's music is haunting and the melodic theme keeps repeating in my mind's ear (as his music usually does).  The casting by Susan Figgis, Janet Hirshenson, Jane Jenkins, and Karen Lindsay-Stewart was phenomenally accurate to the books characters as I perceived them.  Bravo!!  I think Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as Professor Minerva McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape (simply found him incredible), Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid (too perfect), and of course, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy just about perfectly fulfilled the characters as they were presented in the book.<br />I simply loved the special and visual effects, the cinematography, the art, well... everything about it.  And Chris Columbus' direction is superb.  I disagree with those who found it to be a copycat of Tolkien's works or any other movies, and that they were disappointed because the DVD didn't fulfill their expectations as to extra features.  This movie and the DVD are wonderful and captured my heart (and I'm an over-50 adult to boot!).  I will be watching the DVD over and over again.
0767817478|4.0|This is Godzilla here, Not Jurassic Park. I wasn't expecting some Award winning movie with great acting and a amazing plot. This is Godzilla! He's a big Lizard. All I wanted was to see a giant reptile destroying a city and that's what i got. The director (Roland Emmerich) who directed Independence Day, and the Patriot is my favorite director and he did a great job of this movie. He gave me what I, and my friends wanted when we went to see it, and we applaud him, and Dean Devlin.
0452282152|5.0|This is set in seventeenth century Holland, so I suppose I'm a bad person to review it because I start with a prejudice against historical novels. I think the novelist should stick to his or her own time. If I want to know how people spoke and thought in the seventeenth century I'll go to Samuel Pepys's Diary. One problem all historical novelists have is with dialog. Do you make people talk in modern colloquial way, which jars, or have them talk with yeahs and forsooths.  The usual compromise, which Chevalier adopts in this book, is having them talk in a stilted way with little humor or give and take. This conveys an atmosphere of solemnity. There was a lot of tragedy in the seventeenth century, but some people sometimes had good times. One of them was Leeuwenhoek, who appears as a solemn character in this book. He must have been bubbling over with excitement about Hooke's book on the Microscope when he talked to Vermeer. We know from his letters to the Royal Society how lively and interested in everything he was.<BR>     A ten year old child dies of plague in this book, and such terrible things happened then, but it was also possible for an amateur scientist, grinding his own lenses, to enter an unexplored world and start the train of discovery that would stop such things. Leeuwenhoek was the first man to see bacteria.
B0000636UN|2.0|My feelings about the C'mon C'mon album are that it is not<br />what I was hoping for.  I honestly cannot find a single track that I care to listen to more than one time on this album with<br />the exception of the song &quot;Soak in the Sun.&quot;  And this song is not at all representative of the musical style of the rest of the<br />album.  The songs are not catchy on this one nor are they memorable.  Her new style is just not fun.  Her mood and lyrics are melancholy.  This album may be for you if you are into the<br />sound of the classic rock and roll era.  You might consider getting this album then.  However, I think that you ought to listen to this album before you go out and buy it because it is very different in style than her previous work.  This one is made for classic rock fans and not for many pop music fans such as me.
B0000640VN|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I saw it 3 times in the theater, once before the changes were made to it. I am a huge fan of Meg Ryan and have been ever since I saw \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\". Hugh Jackman is quickly becoming one of my new favorite actors. Brad Whitford, whose work on NBC's \\"The West Wing\\" I adore beyond words was also great in this film. It is a great love story centered around this funny little premise, almost a fairy tale. I am also a hopeless romantic so I was destined to love it :)
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forest Gump is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It never fails to reduce me to a sobbing mass on the couch, it's that touching. Anyone who dislikes this movie is crazy in my book, because this is an amazing movie.
B00001NFCY|3.0|I have to admit that I too have diminished the band, maybe subconsciously, for being so popular. But the truth is that I keep enjoying this CD and finiding more on it; it is simply one of the cds that I enjoy the most, even when I hesitate to say it my favorite. <br />  This is not the most perfect masterpiece. If you give it only a first listen or if you dont pay attention to it even if you have listened to it a lot, it may pass unnoticed, mainly because some songs seem to be the same. Still, a careful listen will give you a great enjoyable time and you will discover much more detail than on the now popular similar bands out there. The guitars and the bass and the riffs themselves give this album an interesting dark depth, without always being too heavy. It is darker than Weathered (which I do not listen as much as this one) but a little more detailed than My Own Prison. The songs like in My Own Prison, show a little more confusion and disorder of thought than the newer Weathered, but thats part of what makes it special. This album is thoughtful and full of emotion, be it anger, fear, desperation, or humbleness. This is expressed more by the music and the performance than the lyrics themselves. I love the first songs until it gets to Arms Wide Open, which was overly played. Yet, after having to listen to it so much, and also having the album, I really got into liking it, it has that same detail and depth but in a brighte are much more melancholic way than in the previous songs.<br /> The lyrics are good, although I will not say they are excellent. Stapp seems to want to really communicate which is good, but maybe, not only for communication but for the bands growth as well, he needs more education to improve his writing skills. I am not saying they are bad, the lyrics are much better than most out there, and way less fabricated than those of many of their fellow trl mainstream bands. Their lyrics drew me in part to start listening to them in the first place, so i do think they are good, but they are not something really outstanding. <br />  The two last songs are my least favorite, and well I guess I cannot say a lot about them as i have taken less time to listen to them, but I can say that when I do, i still end up enjoying them. Each time i give it a complete listen, I have a great time and enjoy each song starting from the fun and harder Are You Ready, to the beautiful Faceless Man, passing even through the overplayed yet nice With Arms Wide Open and Higher, to the maybe not original but still great ending songs which actually do make a great closing. It leaves me emotionaly charged, wanting to listen to it again, but feeling fully satisfied with the experience. Human Clay is exciting, dark with some bright sparks throughout, and simpy REALLY enjoyable. Give it a good listen and have a good time. You will really learn to appreciate it.
068484267X|5.0|&quot;anngela's ashes&quot; is about a young irish boy,named Frank McCourt, who was born in New York, with his parents and little brother,during the &quot;1920's&quot;.He later moves to Limereck, Ireland and lives there.He and his family are very poor and they always go to bed hungry.His parents can barely afford to pay for Catholic school for frank and his little brother Malachy.Since this is a true story, based on Frank McCourts life, frank talks about what it was like to live at those times.<BR>  My favorite part of the book is when Franks little sister Margaret is born. His parents loved her alot,because she was the only girl in the family,besides the mother.Frank's father would always hold her and sing to her.The father never did this to his other children.<BR>  I would Recomend this to People who like Biographies on people of the past.Some people might think this was a really boring book,but to me it was one of the best book i have ever read.

B00005K3OT|1.0|What a boring, obvious movie!  Yes, sensuality is good, repression is bad, free spirits are better than uptight clergymen, and the marginalized are always right.  I'm sure the makers of this film live by those principals on a daily basis.  At least they sure love espousing them.  ZZZZZZZZ.
B000002AEN|5.0|Avalon Blues<br />It is hard to believe that these thirteen songs are the sum total of John Smith Hurt's recorded output until he reached the age of 72.  Made in the winter of 1928, these 'sides' represent almost all we know of the 36 year old laborer, share cropper and jack-of-all trades who also happened to be a consummate blues musician.  Things like that make me crazy sometimes.  Even now Hurt's total recorded output only amounts to about 60 songs, most from the studio recordings made in 1966, just before his untimely death.<br />I was still a freshman in college when Mississippi John Hurt was being rediscovered.  It was several years later that I was struggling to learn how to play guitar and his recordings came out.  I remember being astounded - and nearly giving up playing.  Here it is 2002 and I am still entranced by the man's playing - and still trying to perform some of the songs he worked out for himself in Carroll County, Mississippi.<br />The 1928 Okeh recordings are like a telescope into the past, displaying a more driving, pyrotechnic John Hurt than the one who showed up some 36 years later and blew me away.  His guitar style is just a bit faster in pace and has an almost uncontrolled energy.  His voice is just a tiny bit less a part of the music.  But, the raw skill and musicianship are unmistakable.  The impossible syncopation between the bass line, the melody and his singing is already there.<br />Five of the songs also are part of the studio recordings and comparing them is a study in shades of difference.  The guitar work sounds less rushed in the newer versions but actually, the tempo is almost the same.  The Okeh recordings ramble around the beat a bit and the studio recordings are dead on, totally under control.  Hurt's vocal work is also more effective in the 1960's; he and the guitar seem to sing duets.  Yet in 1928 his singing is a bit sweeter.<br />The quality of the Okeh recordings is remarkable considering when they were made.  Obviously, some technical wizardry has been used to reduce noise and enhance audibility and it was well worth the effort.  These are valuable records to me.  Not only does the CD contain six songs that I previously only knew in tablature, but also this is simply great music.  For players and aficionado's this is required listening.  Five stars is hardly enough., some technical wizardry has been used to reduce noise and enhance audibility and it was well worth the effort.  These are valuable records to me.

The thing about this album is its classic after classic. Most people aged between 16-30 know all the songs.

B00005QIPH|5.0|The stooges,are better. The stooges are done making music. Yes, Iggy Pop still makes music. It isn't this good. This is better than almost everything else out there. There are people other than you, who've never had occasion to hear the stooges, the clash, and the velvet underground. This album is good, it doesn't matter if other albums are better, that does nothing to diminish the quality of this album as a piece of music. Is this the future of rock and roll? I sure hope so, because the alternative is Creed or POD. See.

Must buy! Resistance is futile!
B00004Z400|5.0|This is the Deftones' newest CD, and best. Unlike the past 2 CDs, Chino dosen't just scream and moan. In this he kind of sounds like...Maynard James Keenan (Tool) and Chester Bennington (Linkin Park) at the same time. The best songs are &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot;, &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, &quot;Elite&quot;, and &quot;Change (In the House of Flies.&quot; This album is still pretty heavy, despite what I said earlier. Especially &quot;Elite.&quot; If you're gonna get The White Pony, get this version, over all other versions. &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot;'s really a great song. Check out the Deftones if you like old Limp Bizkit, Korn, Tool, Taproot, or Linkin Park

B000002513|5.0|My favorite album by the Boss. Yes, I rate it higher than Born To Run because of the superior musicianship and the over-all high energy of the performances. Kitty's Back and Rosalita put anything else that Bruce has recorded since to shame (I can hear the arguments already...&quot;but what about Jungleland? What about Point Blank?). Yes, both are excellent tunes, among the Boss's best compositions. But this album is Springsteen before the hype, before the mega-fame, when he allowed himself and the E Street band the chance to stretch their musical muscles and produce pure kick-a** rock-n-roll. This is what the Boss's concerts were like in the mid-70's (and I was at quite a few of them). Give it a listen, you won't regret it.
0553260111|5.0|This was a real page turner. I stayed up until 2:20 AM to finish it. That says a lot. I am not usually a big fan of spy novels. This may be the first I've ever read, and it was great. With the movie coming to theaters soon, I thought I'd get a head start on the story. It was great!! One of the rules of good story writing is for the protagonist to know what his go al is, what's driving him to the climax of the story. In this case, the protagonist starts off not only now knowing what he wants, he doesn't know who he is. And we, the readers gradually learn, along with him, not only who he is, but also what he needs to do. This is an artfully crafted novel which you won't want to put down. Needless to say, I'll be reading more Robert Ludlum.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater is a band that is really starting to find their soul. They don't care about what the critics think and I beleive that they really love their fans. Why else would they not sell out and change their music to cater to the masses. The musical ability of the members of this band is unparalled. I have been a big fan of DT for a long time. I have been listening to this album for about four straight months and I still love it. I can say that in the two cd set, each one of the cd's by its self would be a little weak, but if you put the two together, \\"WOW\\" incredible. When I say \\"weak\\" it is only because each cd is shorter than I am used to from a DT album. Like with Scenes From a Memory, BUY THIS ALBUM!! You will not be disappointed.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a must see for all. Superb animation and excellent voice oversbrings this modern day fairytale to life. Shrek incorporates a wonderfulblend of modern and traditional elements. You'll recognize many of yourold fairytale characters (the 3 pigs, the gingerbread man, 3 blind mice,and many more) while at the same time find yourself tapping your toe to'I'm a believer' by Smashmouth. <br />As a comedy it successfully targets awide range of age levels. This is the kind of movie that will keep youlaughing every time you watch it.
B000021XS0|5.0|In my opinion Scenes From a Memory is one of the best musical albums ever put out in the history of music. There is something that grabs me and keeps pulling me back to listen to this album time and time again. Maybe it is the story. The story revolves around a woman (Victoria) who is killed back in the 1920's and a man (Nicholas) who relives what happened to her. The story is very gripping and very well written. Maybe it is the music that keeps bringing me back. I don't think that people that are not Dream Theater fans can understand the musical ability and the talent of the members of this band. The riffs and melodies on this album are unparalleled compared to any other rock album that I have ever heard. And I know my music being a musician. James Labrie also gives his best performance since Images and Words (he is phenomenal). I guess that I just can't say enough about the talent of these guys. MTV should wake up and give Dream Theater and more bands like them more airplay. Being that Dream Theater is most under rated band in the world (along with Enuff Z' Nuff) they have not sold out, and keep doing what they want to do. My kudos to Dream Theater and bands like them! The critics that slam Dream Theater are just jealous that they don't have a fraction of the musical talent of these guys, and furthermore I have read critics slamming this album about the lyrics on it. Lets see any critic come up with a concept like this. If you don't have this album, get it and listen to it, and most of all keep an open mind. Dream Theater can be quite a shock at first.  Give this album a chance. You will not be disappointed.

0142000655|4.0|->While it is often said that quality is much more important than quantity, there are times in which you can slap the two together to get a surprisingly good result.  Such is the case with John Steinbeck's immense novel, East Of Eden.  Although famous for his earlier novel Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck considered East of Eden his more important, life-long work for him.  \\"I've been practicing for a book for 35 years, and this is it.  There is only one book to a man,\\" he said to his publisher when he completed the novel in 1952.  Indeed, this novel is a truly a culminative work of Steinbeck's <BR>     ->The story is tragedy, with rays of hope strewn throughout it and a moral lesson behind it.  It is about the intertwining destinies of two sets of people in the Salinas Valley: the gregarious and emotionally diverse Hamilton family and the passionate, moody Trask clan.  The book centers many of its themes around biblical references, such as the fall of Adam and Eve, and the deadly rivalry between Cain and Able.  The importance of individual identity, and the consequences of blind love are also discussed.  <BR>   ->The book is a example of great story telling.  Steinbeck had a natural flow of language that the reader can relate to and uses practical, to-the-point diction to easily communicate his story.  The progress of the Trask family's development from zealous and impulsive into contemplative and vigilant is fascinating to watch.  Steinbeck makes you either love his characters or loathe them, depending on whom he's talking about.  There's something about his writing that compels you to read on to the next chapter to learn what new tragedy or jubilance will afflict the character next.  It is simply a book that you won't put down; that is, until you realize how much time has gone by.<BR>     ->As with many long novels, the vastness of the plot is sometimes too much to handle, and is the book's main weakness.  The plot is inherently hard to follow at times, because switching back and forth between the two families proves to be challenge.  And with the huge number of characters involved over the span of three generations, keeping track of who's who is no easy task.  The book often goes into tangent-like sub stories from time to time about non-significant characters, and the author's purpose of doing so is not always apparent.<BR>     ->Technicalities of length aside, Steinbeck here has truly written a classic with undying themes and a compelling, tragic story.  If you ever have a fair chunk of time you can dedicate to serious reading, pick up a copy of East of Eden.
1587990717|5.0|This is a book that does away with a lot of the hype in scientific finance and investing.<br />If that sounds intimidating, don´t worry. The book is very readable, also for people with no scientific/mathematical background whatsoever.<br />In the book, the author reminds us of a number of things in mathematics and statistics that anyone who`s read 101 mathematics/statistics knows, really. But he then goes on to demonstrate how these things work in the marketplace and how many of these basic facts are ignored by the pros. Did you know that a fund manager´s past performance really means NOTHING when predicting his/her future returns. Read the book and find out why!<BR> <BR>As I mentioned, the book is very readable and easy-going on the formal stuff. That does not mean that the author fears 4+-syllable words or that he lacks self-confidence. Indeed, he does not shy away from offering you a life-philosophy in the closing chapters. Personally, I found it refreshing/entertaining, but that`s personal... Anyway, putting up with the latter is a small price to pay in comparison with losing out on the info in this book.
0060934719|5.0|I loved reading fairy tales when I was a child, and I love reading them to my child now.  Harry Potter is the closest I've found to a fairy tale that grown-ups will enjoy, but with this book (and others by this author) I've found a delicious fairy tale for the hungry adult reader.<br />This truly is a fairy tale for grown-ups.  It begins, &quot;There was once a young man who wished to gain his Heart's Desire.  And while that is, as beginnings go, not entirely novel (for every tale about every young man there ever was or will be could start in a similar manner) there was much about this young man and what happened to him that was unusual, although even he never knew the whole tale of it.&quot;<br />There's a bit more to the story than that, and it isn't quite as simple as we're led to believe.  Young Tristan Thorn from the village of Wall sets out with a mission and a certain amount of mystery about himself (that we're let into early on, if we pay just the slightest bit of attention).<br />Like Gaiman's hero in Neverwhere, Tristan is a good-hearted young man with the best of intentions.  He promises to leave the village of Wall, where he has lived his whole life, to bring back a fallen star for the woman he loves -- in exchange, she will grant whatever he wants (which is, of course, marriage as he is a charming Prince type guy, the kind you find in fairy tales.)<br />What seems a somewhat simple adventure twists and turns into much more. Medevial times, fairies, unicorns, the moon, bad people (male and female) lead our hero on an exciting adventure and in the end he gets what he doesn't even know he wants.<br />This is a gentle fairy tale for adults by an excellent storyteller.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Mullholland Drive is an extremely disappointing film.  Not because it is bad all the through but because it is a great movie for 3/4's of the way through and then completely falls apart.  It has wonderful David Lynchisms and is stylistically appealing.  Creepy, sexy, mysterious and quirky yet maintains a linear path and you really want to know what happens.  Then the last 1/4 is as if it is a completely different film with the same actors (although you may not be able to tell who's who).  It turns into a surreal mess with no explanation for anything that you have seen in the first part.  While visually interesting, a frustrating waste of time.
0141301120|4.0|This is a funny, funny book! The story is not as good as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but this book is MUCH funnier.<br />I've read from some of the other reviewers' comments that their children didn't really like this book because the dialogue was over their heads. That may well be true--I read this book for the first time as a teenager. I read it out loud to my parents and all three of us were practically rolling on the floor!<br />I think this is a great book, for what it's worth.
B000062TU1|4.0|Having read the books multiple times (I re-read the 1st ones every time a new one came out) I was very psyched to see the film.  The sets, casting, screenplay, acting, etc was superb... every little detail of the world of Harry Potter was marvelously captured on screen with intelligence, humor, and love of all those involved.  Every scene was straight from the 1st book, even though not the entire book was within the film.  Sigh, this is a child's film & therefore I understand that they couldn't have everything from the book in the film because that would have made it 3+ hours long.<br />The only major drawback was the very badly done CGI during the Quidditch games.  They did so well with every other scene in the film, but abruptly threw the games together.  Every single time they shifted from live action to CGI it was painfully noticeable.  When I see a film I like to lose myself within it, and the 2nd rate work they did with the CGI during the Quidditch matches threw me right back into reality.  Because of this I would have given it 4 ¾ stars, but Amazon likes whole numbers.  <br />As for the DVD... there is no \\"real\\" making of Harry to mention, or for that matter any special features at all... AND THEN I had to go here to Amazon to find out that you MUST play the game on disc two to be able to see the deleted scenes.  I never play the games held in the DVD's because they always are too easy, or poorly done to even bother.  Sometimes they are also hard to control with the remote (which is really bad being that I watch my DVD's on a PS2!) I have to tell TM & Warner Bros. Shame on you for ripping off the fans, for the extra money spent for a DVD, one should get more extras.  For example, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" gives you all the special features you expect in a DVD & a 10-15 minute sneak peak of the next film...  I would have given this DVD 3 stars, but the film is still so good I averaged the ranks together and gave it 4 stars.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been an incubus fan since early high school, and now that I am well into my college years I still find that Incubus albums, both new and old are still very enjoyable to listen to.  For people saying that they sold out are mistaken, bands that play the same style music over and over are bound to die, look at everclear, their \\"I had a hard childhood\\" sound lasted a little while, but they're on their way out already.  Incubus grew in that they found new music to create not to sell.  They can still create their old style music but that has already been done so they tried something new.  I cant wait until they come out with their next album and hopefuly it will be more remniscent of their previous albums like Fungus and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.  I rate this album 5 out of 5, I listen to it whenever I drive and I dont forsee myself ever getting tired of it.  I can't think of a reason why anybody shouldn't buy this Album.
0553801481|5.0|Robin Hobb is a developing writer in the best sense of the word. In the original Farseer trilogy she gave us a story that was beautifully crafted and pushed the envelope on realism within fantasy. Liveship Traders was perhaps an experiment in the use of multiple viewpoints, with a dull and ponderous outcome to my mind. But in writing it, Hobb's skill has improved in bounds, to culminate finally in the utter perfection that is \\"Fool's Errand.\\"<br /> I say perfection even though the beginning might be slow for some readers. But once the story gets going, it takes off, plunging the reader into an ever-deepening plot and a world of characters who are among the most complex in the genre. <br /> <br /> In particular, Fitz has only gotten better as a character ever since the original trilogy. Age has matured him and given him new dimensions; and yet at the same time, the scars from childhood still remain, surfacing in ways that are beyond his power and even beyond his awareness. It is possible to perceive how Burrich's upbringing and initial abuse have molded Fitz and how his upbringing, together with his subsequent experiences, shape his responses now. Yet through it all he is the same FitzChivalry we know, speaking with the voice of age and experience, but still familiar. <br />This uncanny gift for psychological depth is unparalleled in the genre, and comparatively rare outside the genre as well. Hobb's characters have a quality of mystery to them. There is more to them beyond the scope of the novel; somewhere they are having thoughts we cannot guess, saying things we shall never know about. Just as people in real life always have hidden depths that are beyond anyone's power to see, Fitz, the Fool, Chade, Nighteyes, Starling and the rest of the cast are not completely revealed to us. Some part of the soul remains backstage, hidden from view, because a depth is there that is so real, it must be infinite.<br /> How the author conveys this I do not know, but it infuses thenovel with movement and intoxicating power. Add this to a riveting and unpredictable plot, moral complexity and as skilled prose as you'll find anywhere, and one clearly has a masterpiece in the making.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne...the new Canadian singer released her single &quot;Complicated&quot;. Anyone with a decent sense of music stopped short the first time they heard it. Her powerful yet feminine vocals and her sk8r pop songs with real lyrics are sure to get you singing along. She's a cross between Alanis Morisette and Sheryl Crow. Throw in just a tad of punk and a pinch of pop let simmer and then you have Avril. Her songs &quot;Things I'll never say&quot;, &quot;Mobile&quot;, &quot;tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; have been on repeat in my car stereo since I got them. Try her out. She's amazing.
0553274503|5.0|I first read this book in the seventh grade.  I cried.  The book, for me, says that underneath that childlike exterior is a man with compassion and love and emotion.  He was just given a chance to express those very things...just for a while.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I read the reviews. I bought the CD. I was ready for something different, even if it wasn't \\"as good\\" as in the past. I was pleasantly surprised. Leonard's \\"new songs\\" aren't really that new. What's different about them is not their beauty (they excel there), its their symmetry-they express vision--a unified vision. What happens when you see things through the eyes of love? Leonard's not only seeing things differently here, he's focused on a universal love and compassion. That vision is full of hope; of course, with hope desperation also comes-nothing new there. If you like Leonard, buy this CD. If you don't like Leonard, buy this CD. As far as the production is concerned, it's all Leonard's even though credit is given to Sharon Robinson. And for her backup singing-it just makes the whole project more beautiful!
B00001U0E1|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film--the acting, the sets and costumes, and the attention to period detail.  The fictional unfolding of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" was brilliantly done.  However, I was shocked when Colin Firth referred to his \\"plantation in Virginia\\" and, again, at the end of the film, spoke of going to Virginia with his bride.  This film supposedly takes place in 1589 and the first English settlement in Virginia was in 1607 (Jamestown).  And, it was a good many years after that before there were any established plantations.  Somebody goofed on this one!!  Aside from this,  wonderfully witty and entertaining film.
0312965788|5.0|The book, All Creatures Great and Small is about Mr. James Herriot as a vet in his mid-thrities at a small town in Shorphire,Egland named Dowrby.  There he is the assistant of Mr. Seigfried Farnon.  They live at the Skedale House with Mrs. Hall and Tristan, who is seigfried's little lazy brother.  At Shropshire, Mr. Herriot deals with the problems of the farmers at the area with their livestock and other domestic animals.  Also at Dowrby, Mr. Herriot falls in love with Helen Aiderson.  Later they become married and live a wonderful life.<br />The reason that I read this book was because our teacher gave us the assignment of doing a report on this book, and I thought that this would be a good non-fiction book to use on my book-reports.  I also choose this book because this is the biggest book in the class and I can read a lot.<br />One of my favorite scenes in the book is the times when Siegfried goes berzerck and he sacks Tristan over and over again without ever remembering once what he had just done and still wakes up the next morning seeing Tristan eating breakfast with him and doesn't wonder why is my brother still here?  I think this is weird and I believe Siegfried has problems and should get professional hep because at some scenes in the book, he really freaks me out.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a great movie, for adults and kids. Adults will find the humor just as much and as their kids will and it's definitely worth the price of the DVD to own. Pixar's animation again exceeds the standards of the current day and gives us a wild visual ride, and a fabulous story....and if that's all you want to know, then quit reading this review right here.<br />....the story, and the truth behind it is what I really want to talk about. Who would have thought that some much truth of our real world would be packed into a supposed kid movie? It is of course, a subtle message that most people will gloss over in light of characters and the cartoon-like funny stuff. If you walked out of this movie just thinking \\"It's a cute movie!\\"...then you did catch the gravity this film's true force. Here is why...., \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is about these creatures from another dimension that harness the fear of children for the use of power in their own dimension...
1577311523|5.0|When this book was recommended to me I thought, \\"great, another book to read.\\"  But when I started reading it, I couldn't put it down - it was as if I were parched and the words were life-giving water - I really did need to read this book!  <br />The most transformational part of this book for me was the advice that if there is something in your life situation that you do not like you have three choices:  change the situation by taking action or speaking out, leave it, or accept it.  By practicing this, my whole world has changed immediately - my relationships with extended family and friends have changed, the way I view my life has changed and I'm having more fun with my children and my husband, and in life in general.  In one week, six people had asked me if I lost weight.  My clothes still fit, so I think it's the weight of all the negativity I've been releasing.<br />Another important change I've made as a result of this book is to be able to distinguish between my true being and my mind - that I AM my being and NOT my mind.  What freedom to realize that I am no longer the prisoner of my thoughts.<br />Thank you Mr. Tolle!
B00006690F|5.0|Em's new CD is haevy. What I mean by heavy is REAL TOPICS. \\"White America\\" made me sweat bullets, simply because he keeps it real despite the fact that he is white. This song is forcing me to take him seriously, after years of me thinking that he was just punchlines. And when I heard \\"Cleaning out my closet\\", I was almost not suprised to hear him lyrically abuse his mother, but was shocked when he wished his mother death. He's anti-coroprate (which shows in all of this CD), and disrespectful, but you cant blame him because people in his life made him that way. Every song on this album contains controversial lyrics, from dissing the lyrically fit Canibus on \\"Square Dance\\", to giving it dirty to Jermaine Dupri. This album Em produced it mostly himself, so the sounds stray away from Dre's gangsta beats and more into the Em's follow my tone beats.The CD is worth the buy even if you are not an Eminem fan because his music gets you in an aggressive mood. to me thats just the right mood to get you through the day.
B00005QIPH|1.0|All this hype over a band that wrote a song called \\"Last Night\\" which is musically a blatant copy of \\"American Girl\\" by Tom Petty?  This band seems pretty faceless and from everything I'm reading and hearing (including the music) tells me that this is the flavor of the month.  This was a waste of money.  This CD proves how shallow the musical times are when a band like the Strokes uses fashion to their advantage.  Too bad they ignored the writing good music part.  No wonder kids are downloading & burning music at an alarming rate.  Their parents already owned Tom Petty so they heard the song already.  Why buy the same song a second time.  The rest of this CD is a classic rock rehashed in designer clothing.  Avoid at all costs.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem is back with his thirld major and fifth solo album \\"The Eminem Show.\\" He handles most of the production on the album, but Dre is producing 3 tracks on the album. When I first heard it i thought it was a great comeback from the grammy winning \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\" i am a rap fan i've loved rap since i heard it when i was born. And i will have to say that Eminem is probably the best lyricist alive today. Eminem raps about what is going on in the world right now. The war on terrorism, and some disses on people. like is long beef with rapper Cannibus, Nsync member Chris Kirkpatrick, techo artist Moby, and he Dre get on producer Jermaine Dupri on \\"Say What You Say,\\" the standout track is \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" where he gets alot off of his chest about his mother.<br />1. Curtains up (skit) * - it wasn't realy needed.<BR>2. White America ... - one of the best song on the album. where he raps about is freedom of speech fair to everyone, and if he wasnt white he wouldn't be so successful.<BR>3. Business ... - He raps about that rap hasn't been the same without him.<BR>4. Cleanin Out My Closet ... - The standout track, and my second best song on the album. where he raps about his mother in a non dissing way.<BR>5. Square Dance ... - a great song. he disses Canibus on this song and gives props to Nas and Dre.<BR>6. The Kiss (Skit) ... - Hilarious skit where he puts a funny take on what happen the night when he say his wife kissing a bouncer.<BR>7. Solider ... - A great song.<BR>8. Say Goodbye Hollywood *** - Didn't really like the song, but the beat is good.<BR>9. Drips (featuring Obie Trice) ... - The worst song on the whole album.<BR>10. Without Me  ... - The first single where he raps about how the music and entertainment industry hasnt been the same without him.<BR>11. Paul Rosenberg (skit) ... - a skit where his manager tells him to stop carrying his gun.<BR>12. Sing For The Moment... - My favorite song on the whole album. and it is so true. he raps about white kids and familys being affected by rap and how kids look up to rappers and idolize them. it also carrys the hook from \\"Dream On\\" by Aerosmith.<BR>13. Superman (featuring Dina Rae) ... - a funny song.<BR>14. Hailie's Song ... - He \\"sings\\" for and about his daughter, one of the nicest songs i've ever heard.<BR>15. Steve Berman (skit) - ... - Eminem finally gets fed up with steve talkin s... about his albums.<BR>16. When The Music Stops (featuring D-12) ***** - A really good and funny song.<BR>17. Say What You Say (featuring Dr. Dre) ... - A great song where Eminem and Dre get on Jermaine Dupri and at the end so does Timbaland.<BR>18. Till I Collapse (featuring Nate Dogg) ... - My third favorite song on the album with a great beat, and it's Eminem at his best.<BR>19. My Dad's Gone Crazy (featuring Hailie Jade Mathers) ... - I think this is a really nice song where he put his daughter on.<BR>20. Curtains Close (skit) ... - really didn't need it.
6305537313|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time on AMC as I was changing channels one evening. (Fortunately, I caught it pretty much from the start.)<BR>What a truly great movie, with a classic George Peppard and the fantastic acting skill of Audrey Hepburn, this is one I would tell everyone to go out and purchase.<BR>A truly classic movie that makes you forget you are actually watching a movie and just takes you along for the ride. Breakfast at Tiffany's did exactly that. From Mickey Rooney, who, I promise, nobody will recognize here, to \\"cat\\", this is one for the ages.<BR>Needless to say, after seeing this on television, I instantly went and bought this on DVD. It takes a heck of a movie for me to go out and do that.<BR>Buy and enjoy, you'll love it.
0971855110|5.0|I can't say enough good things about the Flylady program and what it has done for me, my family, and all the friends I've told about it.  Even though I get the daily Flylady emails, this book just wraps it all up in a nutshell, and it has been great to have it all bound up in print.  I know I can turn to a particular chapter and work on a weak spot.  I've bought three of these and gave them as gifts.  It's a great book, and Flylady is the BEST!
B00003CWRX|5.0|This has got to be my favorite movie of all time.   (Or at least in the top 3).<BR>Russell Crowe is amazing. Really what else can be said that others haven't already articulated.  He should have won the Academy Award for this, why he didn't is beyond me.<BR>Pacino and Crowe together have excellent chemistry and Michael Mann, as always, makes a movie that runs over two and half hours seem like no time at all and leaves you wanting more.<BR>The soundtrack is moody and beautiful and fits the pastel scene work incredibly. <BR>From the Missisippi District Attorney to the scumbag tobacco heads, this movie shows just how disgusting and seedy that people can be and it also shows that there are still people willing to take a courageous stand for their beliefs.<br />EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT, buy this movie, you will not regret it.  By the way, did I say that it was EXCELLENT.
044022425X|4.0|Though Outlander is still my favorite of the series, the fourth book of the story of Jamie and Claire isn't bad.  There's quite a few of the normal mishaps, adventures and debacles that the Frasers always seem to find themselves in the midst of and that make the book a page-turner.  One complaint, though: are the Fraser women forever doomed to endure their pregnancies and birth of their children without their husbands?  Roger's long absence was distressing.  Also, the story of the Englishmen Murchison and Hodgepile seemed less than fully developed and didn't really contribute to the overall story.  It could have been left out.  Still, if you're a fan of the Outlander books, this book is a great continuation of the story.
B00000JGHM|5.0|From the moody, picturesque scenes to the incredible acting, this is one great movie.  While Michael Mann movies seem to always ride over the 2 hour mark, his movies (if you like them) never seem like they're over 2 hours.  Al Pacino and Val Kilmer being two of my favorite actors are very good, especially Pacino, and it blends great action with great acting throughout (which seems difficult to do these days in cinema).<br />All in all, a great movie, and one that I'm always pulling out to watch on my system.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Is Britney's second record better than I expected?  Yes.  Would I recommend it?  Not if you're over twelve.  The title track and \\"Lucky\\" are such well-crafted slices of pure pop courtesy of Max Martin.  These songs go down easy, and you'll be humming to their choruses long after they're finished.  Spears even gives us a some country flavor on the Mutt Lange/Shania Twain-penned \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know.\\"  But elsewhere, the record takes a nosedive--and fast.  The cringe-inducing \\"Dear Diary\\" sounds so girlish from a college-age woman.  She desecrates the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction,\\" quite possibly the greatest rock and roll song ever.  And there are a bunch of other songs that are similarly disastrous.  Back in her day, Kylie Minogue sang songs that were just as formulaic as Britney's, but at least she evolved from that stage and matured as a performer.  With Britney, I'm not so sure.  While this record isn't a bust, her fans deserve much better than this.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is one of the greatest punk rock bands out there. Everything about their CD is awesome! This isn't one of those one hit wonders bands, these guys are gonna make it far!

0060005424|5.0|Lirael is so real, so human.  Nix does a wonderful job portraying her.  Her journey is fascinating.  Super book.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|While \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is a bibliography movie to some folks and a love one to some others, I view it as an art movie. It is a powerful story of mental struggle and spiritual triumph (or survival, or concession, depending on how you look at it). The three delusional images Nash has reflect three basic desires in one's real life --(Parcher) a grand mission toward the society and history that makes one feel self-important and competent, (Charles) a lifetime friendship that disregards the external society but comforts and encourages your innest soul, and (Marcy) a chance of giving and caring for the weaker and the<BR>younger. These desires die hard. I found it extremely touching when Dr. Rosen said to Alicia (Mr. Nash's wife), \\"imagine ... they have been your best friends, now they are not dead, they are not gone, but worse, they have never been...\\", and when Nash told Alicia, \\"sometimes I really miss talking to him [Charles]\\". The fact that Nash has a loving wife from the very beginning and an academic recognition in the end actually made his transition to the \\"real world\\" much easier, as he satisfied some of the desires in an alternative way, imagine other schizophrenia patients who have nothing to hang on to in their \\"real world\\". The first half of the movie is wisely tricky, the second is exceptionally powerful, and the music is extraordinary.
B00005RYKU|3.0|Like so many other movies, this one is about money-- the obsession some people have of it and how that obsession is harmful to them and others. These kids' parents both just died on the way home from celebrating their anniversary. Supposedly, the driver had too much booze in him and swerved off the road in the rain. So the kids go and live with Mr. and Mrs. Glass who live in a glass house. They were old friends of the parents and were to be the legal guardians of their kids if something like this were to happen. Their lawyer tells the kids that their parents were economical and they left them several million dollars. It turns out the Glasses were using them to try to steal their money.<br />Mrs. Glass is a doctor but she turns out to be addicted to heroin. Mr. Glass is in business but their money for the Glass House and his Jaguar sports car turned out to come from a loan shark. It's mysterious at first, because the girl isn't sure whether or not the Glasses are sincere or what the hell is going on. Her brother is younger and is simply content and bought-off with everything the Glasses spoil him with. She does some research and finds out that her parents were set up and murdered; it was no accident. The girl is pretty [good looking], especially when she's in the swimming pool in the scene where Mr. Glass comes out with a towel in the middle of the night. <br />The point of the movie is that money has good use, but you've gotta earn it and be productive-- stealing it doesn't work. And you've gotta live within your means and stay out of debt. Mr. Glass never seemed very happy even with all the \\"toys\\". It sure didn't seem like it was worth all the stress and trouble that he went through to try to steal their money.
B00004UQQP|4.0|First of all, I have been a fan of this album since the 80's, and this is definitely the version to own.  The only problem is this is NOT remastered.  It is the same import disc that has been available since 1988.  I re-purchased it thinking it was an improved version, but it is only a re-release.<br />The bonus tracks are great, and one of them is only available on this edition (&quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot;).  The other four are available on three American CD singles (Dreaming of Me, New Life, and I Just Can't Get Enough).  If you don't own the album, buy this disc.  If you own the American version but want the bonus tracks, buy this disc.  But if you have imported this disc in the past DO NOT re-buy it.  You are getting nothing new for your money.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I saw Avril on TRL and she was Carson's pick of the week I thought she was absolutely awesome at first site! Avril is a 17 year rock skateboard person from a small town in Ontario. I would reccommend this to anyone who likes Vanessa Carlton or Michelle Branch but Avril is better. She is very similair to those three (each play an instrument, are young, write their songs, and arent victimized by teeny bopper stuff). This whole album is written by Avril! <br />Losing Grip-This is one of the more rock songs. It has a cool, catchy chorus but a little to hard rock for me-8/10<br />Complicated-Avril's first single-one of the two more pop/rock songs. Absolutely brilliant! The music video is really cool and the lyrics and everything. It is also mixed really well. Probably the second best song on the cd-10/10<br />Sk8r Boi-This will be her second single. Sorta of like Complicated but I think it has a more catchy chorus. I also love the lyrics on this I think they are pretty funny. My favorite song on the cd-10/10<br />I'm With You-This is one of Avril's ballads. It has a catchy chorus (like all of her songs). In this song you can her how great her voice is-9/10<br />Mobile-This song is one of the sorta rock songs. Another one with a catchy chorus-8/10<br />Unwanted-This song reminds me of Vanessa Carlton. Another of the hard rock songs. I don't really care for this track-7/10<br />Tomorrow-This is a really pretty ballad that is very nice to listen to-9/10<br />Anything But Ordinary-In this song Avril speaks out about not wanting to bel ike other people. It has cool lyrics. Another catchy chorus-10/10<br />Things I'll Never Say-One of the many songs that almost sounds at the beginning like it is Scottish. She even does a little Scottish chant thingy at the beginning of this one. It is pretty cool. This is another of my favs-10/10<br />My World-This song has a little pop feel. It has cool lyrics about her home town and a cool chorus-10/10<br />Nobody's Fool-This is a really great song!!! She sorta \\"raps\\"  in it. Which is sorta funny. Another cool track-9/10<br />Too Much To Ask-Compared to the rest of the album there isn't a whole lot special about this track but is still solid-7/10<br />Naked-This is an ok song but it isn't really special either-7/10<br />This unique teen rocks! 13 absolutely great tracks make this Canadian Rocker one of the best new artists this year. So go check this album out (oh yeah she also has already criticized Britney Spears so she can't be bad). I will be watching to see what her next album will be like!
B00004UQRF|1.0|First of all, if I was rating on the artistic quality of the music alone I would give this album 4 stars.  The problem is this is NOT a remastered edition.  It sounds identical to the American version, except this CD is just slightly louder.  This is the exact same import album that has been available for years.  It does have three bonus tracks (which are not listed on the cover, or the Amazon description) but they are all available elsewhere.<br />The extra tracks are \\"Breathing In Fumes\\", \\"Black Day\\" and \\"But Not Tonight (Extended Remix)\\".  All three of these are available on the American CD single of \\"Stripped\\" (and these also have not been remastered).  So the only reason to get this edition is if you absolutley have to have those three bonus tracks on the same disc as Black Celebration, and don't have access to a CD burner.  Otherwise save a few bucks and just buy the American versions.
B000002L99|5.0|If you were a teenager in 1986, the release of this album was HIGHLY anticipated!  Rock's biggest band getting a new lead singer, a singer who everyone had heard previously.  How would Sammy and Eddie mesh together?  Would the mighty Van Halen still fly?  Once we finally listened to this album, cassette, the answer was a definite YES!  From start to finish (except for &quot;Inside&quot;), this album rocks your socks off.  The ballads especially, with Sammy able to hit those higher notes, reign supreme.  Still plenty of blazing guitar and double bass drumming, this album still sounds great today, and takes me back to a different time, when music was ALL that mattered.  Ah to be young and ignorant again!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|OK, I admit it - I bought the normal DVD first, then the Director's Edition when it came out.  For 28 bucks, you get the regular DVD, a bootleg DVD that's ~30 minutes longer than the original and a Stillwater CD, including &quot;Fever Dog&quot;.  I won't tell you what's in the extra 30 minutes of the bootleg - figure it out for yourself - but if you like this flick, you'll want the extra goodies.  What a great soundtrack!
1563894696|5.0|After every corner is another surprise.  The ending is the best part (like always with murder mysteries).  So don't cheat and look at the back of the book to peek at a few pannels!  You'll ruin the story.  The Art: Batman himself is drawn masterfully, while everyone else is well... different.  I suggest this book to everyone!  If you enjoy good reading then it doesn't matter what type of comics you read (I read 'em all) I garuntee you'll love this book.  The thing I always thought depressing about all TPB's and Graphic Novels is that you can read them in a long afternoon and then back to Earth you come.  Now with this one you can still read it in a long afternoon, but it'll be a bit longer.  I also thought that the title for this book was an excellent choice.  Anyway, BUY IT!
B00003CXI1|4.0|This is a very great film w/ many actors that fit the characters perfectly.  The DVD features are fairly well done, but can get tedious when trying to access some of the extras.  One of them is the deleted scenes.  You have to basically do many different task to access this feature.  Sure it's great if your doing it for the first time, but after that it gets pretty annoying.  On a positive side, this DVD has probably one of the best sounds around (That's if you've the right equipment).  Overall it's a very good DVD that's not to be missed by any Harry Potter Fan.
0142000655|4.0|John Steinbeck's East of Eden goes back in time to describe what life was like in the early 20th century for people in the U.S., more specifically California's Salinas Valley.  Steinbecks' novel however goes a lot farther than just describing life for a specific group of people; his novel is an absorbing yet often times disturbing telling of life itself.  The novel is loaded with numerous significant themes including love, good vs. evil, and jealousy.  In his book, Steinbeck makes several allusions to the biblical story of Cain and Abel (hence where the title comes from) and even models their tale in his own character's actions.  In two different situations in the novel, two brothers find themselves fighting each other for the approval of their father.  Ironically however, both times, their father end up loving the son whom does not really desire nor covet their father's approval.  In both instances, jealousy plays a major role in their actions that followed.  The classic battle between good vs. evil finds itself time and time again in Steinbeck's characters.  Steinbeck however, chooses to emphasize his belief that good and evil are both inherent parts of society, and that the main battle is the character's CHOICE of good or evil.  Steinbeck's last and probably most enduring theme are the effects of love and the consequences of its absence.  Every significant conflict in the story finds itself in the middle of a struggle between characters for the love or appreciation of another.  Whenever love is absent from a specific situation, the results become disastrous.  In East of Eden, Steinbeck emphasizes the importance of the presence of love in the lives of all people and its powerful role in every outcome.  Perhaps my main problem with this book is its organization.  Steinbeck seems to jump from one story to another, losing the reader through confusion.  Many stories seem to be brought up out of nowhere and end up having no real weight in the novel's \\"big picture.\\"  Inthe end however, the book is an excellent read as well as an intriguing look into life.
038533558X|5.0|This book is intriguing and well written and will hold your attention to the very last page.  Lessons learned about loving and the pain of losing all you hold dear.  A real page turner.  Harlen Coben writes in a style for easy reading.  A must read!
B00006690G|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET!!! I love all of the songs. He seems to have put alot of work into this album and it has all paid off! I would really really get this cd
B00005BCPC|4.0|...And so we have \\"Mansfield Park\\", \\"loosely\\" based on the Jane Austen novel of same name (although, as is mentioned in the credits, Austen's letters and non-fiction writings are also used, particularly for dialogue). The characters keep their original names, but, for the most part, not their personalities. The heroine, Fanny Price, is changed from the quiet, deeply moral character of the book into a feisty tomboy. The story follows the basic threads of the novel, but adds several subplots and individual scenes that you are not likely to find in any Austen novel (Fanny's uncle giving her the once over, Mary Crawford giving her the once over, etc.). So why the four stars?<br />Well, as an adaptaion, the film only merits two at best. But taken by itself and judged as a movie, I have to admit it's quite entertaining. While not the Fanny of the book, as played by Frances O'Conner the Fanny of the film is extremely likable. Embeth Davidtz and the very appealing Alessandro Nivola have a lot of fun with their characters; Nivola in particular capturing the mixture of sleaziness and vulnerablity that makes the womanizing Henry Crawford ever so slightly attractive. The visuals are sumptuous, and the dialogue is laced with Austen's unique wit, much of it not in the novel. My only real problems with the film are with the slavery subplot (icky and distracting) and Johnny Lee Miller as Fanny's true love. Changing the chracters personalities also changes their motivations, and the actions of Edward, while making sense in the book, are not logical in the film. As a result, Miller's Edward comes off as wimpy and indecisive and detracts from the story.<br />Other than these two quibbles, I quite like this little movie. You are more likely to enjoy it, I think, if you aren't comparing it to the novel the entire time, as it really has very little to do with Austen's story. Taken as a straight period film, though, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is an enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon.

B000063JDE|5.0|Recent Lynch films that have been released on DVD hardly live up to this one. I bought both \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me\\" and \\"Muholland Drive\\", and was satisfied that I at least had stunning digital transfers of each (the sound being nearly perfect on both... profound sound being, after all, a Lynch trademark), but the Special Features left more to be desired. The \\"Blue Velvet: Special Edition\\" DVD, however, remedies these regrets tenfold. A completely absorbing documentary about the making of the film, entitled \\"Mysteries of Love\\", allows the viewer a rare and wondrous glimpse into the great director's actual filmmaking process. Testimonials from the likes of frequent collaborators Kyle Maclachlan, Laura Dern, Angelo Badalamenti and cinematographer Frederick Elmes are so rich and insightful, you really begin to feel as if you've passed through the red velvet curtains where the gum you're chewing has gone out of style. I wasn't crazy about the attempt to re-construct \\"deleted scenes\\" with mere photographs and moody music, but the Siskel and Ebert review from way-back-when is a real hoot. You just can't help but miss Mr. Siskel. Commentary-wise, Lynch himself is nowhere to be found. Fair enough. As far as I'm concerned, the man need not \\"explain\\" anything. As for the film itself, words fail me. It is a bad, brutal, beautiful dream I will certainly not mind having over and over again. This is what the DVD medium is all about.
B00005Y228|5.0|I can honestly say I hated Kylies single I cant get you out of my head.  I felt like someone was driving a knife in my back everytime I heard it, very overplayed.  So in short I thought I would never buy this CD.  But I heard the CD playing in my freinds car, I was loving the CD very much.  At first didnt realize it was the Kylie CD and before I could ask who it was the painful out of my head came on.  However I had to get this CD immediatly.  I love all the other songs on the CD.  Its definatley a fun album.  So its one song I dont like, no ones perfect.  Its about time Kylie gets noticed.

1558908382|5.0|It is not easy to make a murderer a sympathetic and likeable character, but this movie succeeeds in doing just that.  As Blank, Cusack does a great job portraying a professional killer who is beginning to get disillusioned with his job.  It's not guilt - he feels he is only killing bad people - but a feeling that his life is empty.<br />During this period of spiritual blight, Blank gets an invitation to his high school reunion, which also happens to be near where his next job should be.  Since he disappeared right before his senior prom, he knows that there will be some fences to mend, in particular with his abandoned prom date, played by Minnie Driver.<br />This is all brilliant comedy, as Blank tries to reunite with his old love and think about a more legitimate life, all the while pursued by government agents and other killers.  There are a lot of great lines and funny moments and this is a showcase for Cusack, who, while always a great actor, particularly shines here.  His sister Joan, playing Blank's assistant, is also exceptional in her limited role.
0609610570|5.0|Larry Bossidy and Ram Charan first clearly demonstrate why the most effective business leaders are not out of touch with day-to-day activities but are deeply involved with all aspects of execution. For that purpose, Bossidy and Charan convincingly analyze recent failures in execution within companies such as Xerox, AT&T, and Lucent. Bossidy and Charan then examine the three building blocks that execution-driven leaders must use to design, install, and operate effectively the people, strategy, and operations processes within their organization. Those building blocks are the distinctive modus operandi of execution-driven leaders, a culture that thrives on accountability and links rewards to performance, and the selection of the right people for the right jobs. To their credit, Bossidy and Charan have a jargon-free laser focus in reviewing the stumbling blocks that underlie the execution gap in those three areas. Bossidy and Charan indeed illustrate each of those stumbling blocks with relevant examples from their practice that makes it very enjoyable to read. Bossidy and Charan then explore the people, strategy, and operations processes that are built on the above-mentioned foundation for execution excellence. Bossidy and Charan brilliantly illustrate with clear examples the multiple links that exist among those processes and their interaction with the outside world. To summarize, \\"Execution The Discipline of Getting Things Done\\" is too valuable to take dust on readers' shelves. Any leader aspiring for execution excellence can indeed find an enduring source of inspiration in that reference book.
B00005AXEL|4.0|: After a seven year hiatus during which two best of compilations and a new live Fleetwood Mac Album were released, Stevie Nicks is back and after the disappointing &quot;Street Angel&quot;, which was her last solo project released in 1994 it is nice to know that the musical song stress can still write her heart out. The album features many good songs and a few oddities (Fall From Grace an autobiographical effort is a hard rock song that doesn't do the song justice). The good material of which there is plenty consists of the lead single &quot;Everyday&quot; (One of her best songs) to the albums second single &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, featuring back up vocals by long-time friend Sheryl Crowe, who also helped produced many of the albums tracks. The album also features vocal harmonies from the likes of Macy Gray, (Bombay Sapphires) Natalie Maines (Too Far From Texas) and Sarah McLachlan (Love Is produced by Sarah's husband Pierre Marchand). Hands Down her best album since 1985's &quot;Rock A Little&quot;. Best song on the album: Everyday
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is AMAZING!<BR>no matter what kind of music you are into, Avril Lavigne will definitely catch you with her absolutely amazing voice, in depth lyrics and punk personality. I guarantee you will be touched by at least one (if not ALL!) song on this CD, she is not fake at all, and it shows in her music and her personality. Avril Lavigne is incredible and i know anyone who buys this CD will LOVE it.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have all of Ms. Krall's superb recordings but I believe TLOL outshines everything she did before. <br />I've listened to the album probably 100 times in the last eight months.  It's heady, mood-altering music. At the end of a long, maybe rotten, day, the opening notes of \\"S' Wonderful\\" sink in like that first sip of scotch. Krall's haughty cover of \\"Cry Me a River\\" makes Julie London sound like Julie Andrews. I've loved the London version since I was a teen but I bought \\"A Touch of Class\\" just to compare and it's true. At times, I wish Spanish were my native tongue so I could appreciate what must be a sexy Canadian-accented \\"Besame Mucho.\\" (Remember how cool Astrud Gilberto sounded on \\"The Girl from Ipanema?\\") <br />Matters of taste aside, here are some facts to consider before purchasing this album: <br />*Jazz Twits: if your thing is listening to \\"risky,\\" \\"offensive\\" treatments and other silliness, this CD won't look good in your collection. It's for entertainment purposes only.<br />*The ten tracks do have similar arrangements but the melodies are all distinct. Sameness, per se, is not bad. Check out \\"The Intimate Ella\\" for an example of 13 identical arrangements.<br />*The orchestra does not drown out the singer, reviews to the contrary. Krall's voice is characteristically so clear and prominent that you can hear intimate vocal sounds. (The production won Al Schmitt a Grammy for engineering.)<br />*Soothing, down-tempo bosas may not be for all the people, all the time. Reasonable people understand this and move on. Personally, I wish this had been a two-volume set.
0805047905|5.0|BROWN BEAR, BROWN BEAR is a soothing, rhythmic book.  The repetitive nature of the book makes it very calming to babies.  It lulls my baby to sleep every night.  The illustrations are very interesting for baby to look at, as well.<br />This book is a must have for new parents.  (I wish I had more than one...one for baby's room and one for the road!)
B00006690H|4.0|It was a good cd but nothing compared to the Marshall mathers lp. The raps were justa as good if not better but it was dr dre who couln't make up those cool beats this time. There werent as many swears (thank God) last album edited u couln't even hear him. The skits were horrible. but o well great cd, thanx Em. ill still buy his next album.  (oh and 1 more thing) Eminem seemed 2 use his angry voice more in this cd if ya no wat i meen, example: nice voice=the real slim shady,  Mean voice: the way i am.  em used the mean voice in every track except without me.
0694003611|5.0|I received three GOODNIGHT MOON books as gifts when my baby was born, and now I know why!  GOODNIGHT MOON is a soothing, rhythmic book.  It is one of two books that lulls my baby to sleep every night. <br />The alternating color and black-and-white pictures are soothing and calming.  The bright green colored pictures gradually become darker and darker as sleepy time approaches.  The words are melodic and can even feel hypnotic if read in a certain way.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is one of those delightful books that I love to re-read when I little down--a little funky.  I know it will pick me up and brighten this somewhat dismal world that sometimes comes down the road.<br />Watership Down  is the allegorical story of a warren of rabbits who have to flee because their country domain is being destroyed by modern man and technology.  It is the story of Hazel, Bigwig, Fiver, and the rest of their friends and family as they try to find a new living space in this sometimes cruel world.  They have their own bunny language, their own epic heroes, and their own lives which every reader can equate to his or her own self.  <br />I thought this is one of Adam's best works, and I found in it much suspense as the rabbits make their way across the English countryside with just enough pauses for me to catch my breath and continue on. After all, these are rabbits.  <br />In this sometimes cold and callous world, we need more bunnies.
0307120007|1.0|I know it's a classic, but I really don't care for it. I find the book fairly uninteresting and the illustrations dull. Our baby just doesn't respond to this book as much as with other books.<br />I think that there are much better books out there with much better content and illustrations.
B0000009S3|5.0|Hot Rats is my all-time, all-around, all-purpose recording. It is neither jazz, nor rock,  nor pop, and was first wave of the Fusion revolution, setting a standard for Fusion groups for years to follow.<br /><br />What it's NOT, is one of those silly, audio-theatric Flo and Eddie compositions stuffed to the gills with silly sophmoric lyrics.<br /><br />I'm not gonna get into the jazzy musicology stuff that you might see in a review of that kind, but I can  rwecommend a few things:<br /><br />Hot Rats is \\"To be listened to under almost any circumstance\\", especially<br />for: typing-your-school-paper, listening while at work without losing concentration, playing it for your kids without feeling like a foolish old fogey from the Sixties.<br /><br />One last thing. I don't know where I heard this, but that is NOT Frank, Captain Beefheart, or a \\"guy crawling out of a coffin\\" on the front cover. That is Andy Warhol superstar Viva cavorting in a drained-out Southern California swimming pool.
B000002KBA|5.0|This is with no arguing the best Heavy rock album ever made! Blackmore is at his best in the writing capability and he does it with emotions! The album contains 7 tracks(8 if you have the remastered version) and all of them are songs that will stay with us rockers that loves good music for all time! Blackmore,Lord,Paice,Gillian and Glover are all very involved in this record and expessially Gillian`s voice is at the top on this monster of an album! It opens with the tremendous Speed King that has a very powerful start that ends with a bang and there it goes.That`s one of my favourite tracks. Then it`s Bloodsucker with it`s powerful riff that blowed me away the first time along with the screaming of Gillian. Child in time is another of my favourites and that`s because of the screaming in the middle by Gillian but i must admit that the screaming is much better on the Made in Japan record but i like the studio track better because it is not so long and the solo is much  more exiting!Flight Of The Rat is a very good number and the Paice solo at the end is astonishing! Into the Fire has an outstanding riff that`s very much like Jimi Hendrix`s type of music but this song is much better than any Hendrix song! Living Wreck is in my opinion the only weak track on the album. Hard Lovin Man is a great song with an incredible solo by Blackmore and Black Night is nothing else than goooooooooooooooooood! overall this album is worth not just five stars but 6! I mean that this is the best MK2 album! I recomend it to every creature on earth that loves rock music!!!
6305428042|4.0|After quite a few Years, Walt Disney's \\"Hocus Pocus\\" has finally been released on DVD. I was quite disapointed to find that there are NO SPECIAL FEATURES, but with the DVD presented in Widescreen and 5:1 Dolby Surround sound, It almost makes up for it. (I can't believe they couldn't even include the Movie Trailer!) Common Disney, re-release this DVD again and include the Numorous Deleted scenes, like The Supermarket Sequence, The Swimming Pool Sequence, ect ect., and how about including the Documentary of the Making of the special effects of Hocus Pocus that was shown on the Dicovery Channel back in 1994? Common Disney, you can do better than this DVD!!!
630027120X|5.0|This movie is simply brilliant. [Negative] critique needs to be replaced by something more consistent with most viewers.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is one of the most refreshing films I have seen in along, long, long time. It has color and style and energy and music and pacing and performances and more and more.<br />This is the kind of film you'll either love or hate. No middle ground here. Ewan MacGregor and Nicole Kidman give outstanding performaces. All the supporting cast are just as brillaint. The sets and costumes are magnificent and the cinemantography extremely vibrant and exciting.<br />This movie is so stylized - that hoping it will remain one of a kind.<br />The DVD edition is &quot;Spectacular&quot;! The commentary, bunus footage, music videos and the unique interactive menus are brillaint. This is a must in every ones collection. I had just as much fun discovering all the goodies on this DVD as I did watching the actual movie.<br />I still am watching it!
B0000048V8|5.0|This has been a family favorite since my eldest son, (now 14) was six months old.  It was the video I used when my boys were very young and were ill in the night, or just couldn't sleep.  We'd turn the sound off and watch the story unfold, usually falling asleep just after the motorcycle sequence.  We still watch this movie, as a family, at Christmas time.  My youngest is now seven.  Last Christmas, we subjected a room full of my son's teenaged friends to this movie.  They loved it!
B000059Z8J|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD release from start to finsih. There are two version of the movie. Behind the scenes info and background information and the best part for me....<br />The original auditions for the casting of Lois Lane. Many now famous performers auditioned and didn't get the job that Margot Kidder did.<br />Watching the original uncut version with Christopher Reeve at his best was a gem. This DVD is definately worth it for the fans of the man in blue. Learning the insides from the commentary on costumes, sets and props. It was fun. ALso the intractive menus are very cool too. There's even an isolated soundtrack for the musical score by the ever popular John Williams.<br />I watched it several times on the first day!
0930289234|4.0|Despite being a comic fan for many years, I had never read \\"The Watchmen\\" until recently.  It's routinely called one of the best stories ever published in the comic book genre.  For those of us who didn't fall in love with it all those years ago, does it live up to the hype?  Not quite in my eyes, but it's an excellent story that is well worth buying, reading, and re-reading.<br />\\"The Watchmen\\" is set in a unique universe where superheroes have been banned and the world is on the brink of nuclear war.  The story starts off as a murder mystery and grows into a tale of truly epic proportions.  Alan Moore paints a largely dark picture of humanity and weaves a story that is so intricate it absolutely demands your full attention.  The characters are far from stereotypical or shallow.  Everyone from the heroes to a street vendor seems real and three-dimensional.<br />At the same time, what was very edgy and groundbreaking in the 80's isn't quite as revolutionary today.  It's thought provoking and an excellent story that runs much deeper than almost anything else you can find in comics today.  Just don't buy it thinking this is the ultimate thing you could ever read... it's \\"only\\" excellent.
B00000IMCW|4.0|What else can be said that hasn't already been said?  If you're a fan of Romero's zombie movies, Dawn of the Dead is by far the best.  The picture quality of this DVD version isn't bad...especially considering the age of the film.  Very little in the way of color artifacting and interference.  The VHS version can't compare, although the sound seems to shift from quiet to loud in certain scenes which is a little odd.<br />I must say the one disappointing aspect of this DVD version has to be the much touted extras.  The Monroeville Mall clip is nothing but a 15 second 1970's-era commercial.  From what the packaging said, I figured it was some sort of short documentary detailing the location and reasoning as to why this particular location was used.  Sadly, that was not the case and I felt a bit mislead.  Also, the &quot;extra&quot; scenes from the European release Zombi are again rather lacking and misleading.  Only two alternate scenes are shown and even then, the differences are VERY small such as some extra dialog thrown in on the scene when the group is in their safehouse area in the mall and the engagement ring dinner scene is slightly different.  The film quality is REALLY bad in these extra scenes and isn't what I was expecting.  <br />If you get the DVD just for Dawn of the Dead, you won't be disappointed.  If you want more in the way of extras, spring for one of the other director's cut editions.
1565847032|4.0|I first crossed paths with Dr. Chomsky when I took a linguistics class way back when. As far as I know, he remains a leading figure in that field. UNDERSTANDING POWER is a distillation of material from many talks Chomsky gave on NON-linguistics topics during the late 1980s through the mid-1990s. One or two excerpts came from talks he gave in the late 90s.<br />Chomsky's subjects cover everything that should concern a good liberal--oppressed workers, bad schools, free speech, etc.--which I think I am, although not a card-carrying sort as I seldom participate in demonstrations. However, elected officials hear from me from time to time and I vote. I also belong to a union, engage in organic gardening, recycle, drive a 12-year old Toyota, and voted for Al Gore (okay, okay, I know you guys voted for Nadar).<br />I don't agree with everything Chomsky says. For one thing, I don't agree with his position on Israel. I am closer to Thomas Friedman on that score--whom Chomsky pretty much characterizes in this book as a patsy for the powers he's trying to help the reader understand. I do agree with Chomsky that large corporations are a VERY big problem worldwide as the French historian Braudel has pointed out in his wonderful books. I also agree that the patent and trade business is troubled--although Chomsky does not fully discuss how the corporations buy up \\"threatening\\" patents, i.e. patents that would produce less costly substitute goods. I also agree that many laws on the books concerning worker rights and health and safety and environmental issues are not being enforced. MANY laws are not being enforced and individuals can and must join forces to make the authorities act. Maybe I am naive, but I belive voting the right person into office helps.<br />Chomsky really does not offer solid ideas for fixing the current world-wide military-industrial complex and rapidly deteriorating environment other than to say \\"you guys get out there and do something.\\" Maybe he functioned as a motivational speaker at these sessions but quite frankly I would have left depressed not energized. Why not focus on success stories--like the one PBS told the other night about the Swiss firm that found a way to produce a non-toxic product (Susan Sarandon narrated it so you know it was good.) I believe companies can be and have been \\"encouraged\\" to act responsibly by the representatives of the people (McDonald's and chickens and styrofoam cups for example). I also believe some corporations are more reasponsible than others.<br />The real question Chomsky does not address in this book is who within the corporation holds the power. If you have a 401K or own stock outright you know you have little say-so, but the owners of the means of production can organize and act, and have organized and acted. The most important person is the consumer however, and Chomsky doesn't say enough about how consumers can and have affected bad corporate citizens. Chomsky points out that corporations are bottom-line oriented and vulnerable on that account.  Why not go all the way and talk about how consumers can boycott goods and services until they respond. And, be a responsible consumer. If you want cleaner air, don't drive a SUV. Riding lawn mowers, leaf blowers, and weed whackers foul the air unless they are electric-powered.<br />Chomsky says he thinks it is important to read material written by individuals with differing perspectives. I agree. That's why I read his book AND I read conservative writers in the Wall Street Journal and Washington Times--and why I read THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND by Alan Bloom (Chomsky discusses this book in his book).<br />Lastly, I found the online footnotes associated with this book extremely interesting. Much of what Chomsky cites has been taken from secondary material written by the very journalists he disparages.as a motivational speaker at these sessions but quite frankly I would have left depressed not energized.

0684830515|3.0|I think this story has a good meaning to life in it. The story talks about friendship, love, and life. Throughout the story, the characters face many problems concerning friendship, hatred, and the special ones. All the characters have different interests and some try to get their way through, and others just give. All of this could teach a reader a lesson. The next time you have a problem with your friends, you can relate to this and resolve your problem. With the difference in interest, the characters develop some hatred for each other. Although they were really good friends at the beginning of the story, they start to see each other's bad traits and start to dislike each other. There are some that can bear with each other, but most of them dislike each other. <BR>Another problem in the story was love. One of the characters liking another caused problems because of the way they act in front of one another. Another problem was other characters developing feelings for the same female. This caused problems between the two males, and between the female and both males. <BR>Reading this story lets you know the hard times of life, and it gives you advice on your problems.
B00003CXI1|5.0|After hearing all the hubbub about Harry Potter from children and adults alike, I had to see for myself.  I was pleasantly surprised by this well-made movie and by the wonderful imagination of the author who created this delightful story.  It has everything a child could want in a story--a likeable hero, his two pleasant sidekicks, scary villains, and fast-paced action.  Everything about this movie is first-class, from the excellent cast to the writing to the special effects and visual delights which await the viewer.  It joins other wonderful children's classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, and creates a totally satisfying entertainment experience for adults as well as children.  The popularity of this story is well-deservedl--well-done Ms. Rowlands and everyone who had anything to do with this film!
B000062TU1|5.0|This is one of the best movies for kids and adults I have seen in a long time. It has lots of magic, some intrigue that kids can keep up with, honor and sticking by your friends lessons that both kids and adults can learn from these days. The cast is excellent and the kids, Harry, Weasley, and Herminoe just hit it off and meld together.<BR>  The Quiddish match is fun to watch and exciting. Makes you wonder how they did it so well. The extras that come with the dvd are fun too. I even sent a Harry Potter greeting to someone and it made them smile for the day!<BR>  You really can't go wrong with this movie, it's fun, and if you read the books,you know what's coming, but its fun anyway. Don't over analyze it, just sit back and enjoy it.
B00003CXI1|1.0|The first 20 minutes were ok and kept me entertained, but once Harry gets to the school, there ia a whole hour of dreamy, pointless nothingness that left me empty and asleep.  Following that there is a whole sequence where Harry plays some game where he has to catch some gold bug thing, and that is followed by about 30 minutes of plot development, which was ok.  I'll let you be the judge and not give away the exciting ending.
0679892478|4.0|My daughter wanted this book read to her several times a day, every day, for months when she was two.  It is wonderful, predictable text and teaches counting and rhyming.  Dr. Seuss didn't put his name on it originally because it wasn't up to his standards, but it's still a great little kid book!
6305907145|5.0|While Mansfield Park is a loose adaptation of the original book, it should be acknowledged that it is a moving film made with much care and love for the story.<br />Movies made from books are always an interpretation of the text. Mansfield Park was a lushious, emotional film that transports one into 19th century England and makes you long to be part of that world.<br />It is well acted and beautifully photographed. It provides us with what most of us are looking for in a good, dramatic film. A well crafted story with characters that we can truly care for.<br />It is a temptation to be an armchair critic and deride the film for its independance of the original story. But that defeats one of the primary purposes of film. A film such as this can make us forget our cinicism and take us on a journey (if we are willing to go along for the ride).<br />It was truly wonderful.
0784010501|4.0|This film, which shows Madonnas frank story about her life and splendid concert scenes, became an issue when it was released, because of some suggestive scenes. However, when I have seen this film, it is not a problem that it is just her candid attitude for music and her life. Sometimes, I thought that her frankness is going too much, but that is only her personality. This film can be approved as a documentary film in spite of a little lasciviousness. First of all, this film was made, concert scenes filmed with a color, and out of stage, interview scenes filmed with a black and white. I was very impressed by her concerts; it was pretty amazing and excellent. She is not a singer who just shows sexy body, has a passionate stage manner, splendid dancing and outstanding singing ability. She deserves to be famous as a singer. Generally, a pop singer who pays attention to show sexy body or dance, usually do not have a good singing ability. But, Madonna always has an impassioned live concert. In addition, she has a firm faith about her own music. As I see these scenes, I have realized that I had a prejudice about her. She talks frankly and straightly that is her one of charm. Anyway, this film made room to think about her further. It is one of good documentary about pop star.
6302824613|5.0|&quot;Casino Royale&quot; was a film I longed to see for a long time.<BR>It has great scenery, moments of comical experience, groovy chicks, and a top leading/supporting cast. David Niven is outstanding as Sir James Bond, along with Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles and all the rest. The ending fight scene is side-splitting and action packed. Although it was kind of disappointing when the seven 007s died in the end. Great movie still. Please re-release and THX remaster it!
0786867973|5.0|This is an excellent book both for its recipes and for those nights when all you want to do is just kick back with a great book and snuggle up in bed.  Her style of writing is refreshingly down-to-earth  Her recipes are well written, easy to follow and written in such a way that you almost feel as if she's right next to you, guiding you through the whole process. <br />I love her recipes for:<BR>Molten chocolate babycakes<BR>Sour cream chocolate cake with sour cream icing!
0446677450|5.0|This book has completely altered my way of thinking.  It was so fascinating to finally learn what I hadn't in school.  I am terrible with my finances, and now I know why.  Not only do I know why, but I know how to set my sights to avoid it in the future.  I would just like to thank Mr. Kiyosaki for writing such an eloquent book on a subject that needs more attention.  He doesn't give you a specific 'THING' to do in order to get rich (a good thing, because everyone would have done it, and that would have ruined it for everybody), but he tells you how wealthy people got that way.  If you feel like you're &quot;missing&quot; something in life, or if money seems like an impossible dream to you, do yourself a favor and read what Mr. Kiyosaki has to say.  You'll be pleased, very pleased.
0060930187|1.0|People who claim this is one of the best books they've ever read clearly have not read many books.<br />Plath's description of her main character's descent into crippling depression is unremarkable and hardly credible, made even more so by the fact that Esther's life is so dull to begin with. When did she undergo the electroshock therapy--on page 1 or page 101? We can't tell because Esther's a bore right from the start and there's no difference in her character between &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; Plath does an unenviable job of turning her tumultuous life into a tedious collection of journal entries of a lifeless, forgettable character. The ambiguous ending only serves to punctuate the lack of anything creditable about this book.
B00005YXZH|1.0|I'm a huge Uncle Tupelo fan. I love most of what Son Volt did. I wasn't fond of Jay Farrar's solo effort this year \\"Sebastopol\\". I love, love, love Whiskeytown and like, like, like Ryan Adams newer stuff. I loved Wilco's AM, and every record since then by them I've liked less and less. There are wonderful, wonderful moments on those records. I must admit, you have to really sell me on mellow songs. Ryan Adams writes great mellow stuff, and has the voice to tell those stories. So does Jeff Tweedy, but I don't find most of his mellower stuff rewarding.<br />But I took a chance on YHF, believing the hype and good reviews. A good friend of mine highly recommended it. I've listened to it a number of times now, because I believe you have to do that even on stuff that initially you doubt...and I've come up shaking my head. I don't get it.<br />Something I've noticed about Wilco songs, many of them don't seem to know how to end. They often sort of fall apart at the end, or devolve into noise of some kind, or just drift on a hook (Shot in the Arm would be an example of this...love the song, but it just keeps going and going, but not really \\"going\\" anywhere). This new album completely confirms my theory of this. Except on this CD, not only do the ends of songs sort of fall apart into weird noise-fests, sometimes they start that way or drift into that in the middle.<br />Everybody has different tastes. I like hooky pop songs, even ones with an edge. I hate Britney Spears. I grew up loving Cheap Trick, Beatles, Zep, and all blues and jazz. I don't mind avant-gard (although I also don't like the new Radiohead stuff, and I've loved their stuff up to and including OK Computer). You have the right to like YHF, of course. But listen to it first if you can. It sounds like outtakes and B-sides to me. I love you, Jeff...but this one's not for me.
B00005ASHM|5.0|This is Pop Music at its more beautiful. A genial vocal work with the correct melody. If &quot;Revolver&quot;(The Beatles's masterpiece) was considered the best album of the XX century, I should say that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is problably the natural rival for that album. <BR> Essential for any CD's collection. Superb!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is sexy, talented, and eloquent. He is one of the best singer/songwriters to have come along, taking ranks with so many esteemed artists to come before him, but I will refrain from making a list to determine where he lies in this musical hierarchy. Support him; he deserves it for his hard work and pure talent. I look forward to seeing what he comes out with next.
B000007VCM|5.0|This is without a doubt the best album of The Cult. A truly masterpiece of Rock Music. With some of the classics of the band, &quot;Love&quot; is high above all the Rock titles that were produced during the first half of the eighties. Its all about SOUL... GENIAL!
0140177396|5.0|The book  Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is about two guys named Lennie and George.  Lennie and George are the best of friends and have been for years now. George and Lennie are looking for a job and have found one but they have to walk there because the bus driver dropped them off saying that where they want to go is only a couple of miles down the road.  It ends up being ten miles that George and Lennie have to walk and so the end up having to spend the night outside because they need to rest.  After walking all of this way the two men are starving but all they have to eat is beans because it is the great depression and not many people can afford much else. <BR>  George and Lennie are the best of friends because they look out for one another.  Well it's mostly George looking out for Lennie because Lennie is a little slower than most and  doesn't always understand things the first time around.  So George and Lennie go from one place to another looking for work because most people don't respond very positively to Lennie because of the way that he is. Lennie just likes to touch soft things and that is what makes him happy and feel warm inside. Since Lennie is so big and he doesn't know his strength and ends up killing the little animals that he loves to pet so dearly. So that is how George and Lennie ended up on the farm, and there is where everything came to an end.  <BR> George and Lennie got there to work, and while there Lennie fell in love with some puppies that were barely born.  Lennie couldn't stand to be away from those puppies when he didn't have to.  While spending time with the puppies Curley's wife went into the barn to talk to Lennie and she found out that he liked to touch soft things and had him touch her hair. Lennie liked it's softness so much that he didn't want to let go and got scared and accidentally killed Curley's wife. This was a very bad thing and he knew it so he went to hide in the brush like George told him to do if he ever did a bad thing.  When they found the body everyone knew that Lennie was the man responsible so they all went looking for him to kill him.  George knew that the only way that Lennie would not be really punished for what he did was if George killed him himself. That is exactly what George did and it was the only thing that could have been done to really save Lennie. The book was very serious and stayed that way throughout the novel. <BR>  This book talked about very serious subjects and didn't change throughout the book.  George and Lennie just want their own farm and the ability to do whatever they please from the beginning and that doesn't change throughout the book. In the beginning of the book George expresses that he is tired of having to always worry about  Lennie and that George would be much better off by himself.  Throughout the novel George doesn't change and while he does take Lennie with him everywhere he goes he still feels the same, and he knows that even though at the end when he has to kill Lennie it is the best for everyone because if he wouldn't have done it Lennie never would have been able to live a truly happy life with no worries. <BR>  During the end of the book when George knew that he had to kill Lennie and just  let Lennie keep talking about his dreams of the rabbit farm and George killed him was the most moving seen for me because there is nothing worse than killing someone you love not because you want to but because you have to.  I think that the author was trying to give everyone who read this book a feel for what it is that people who are like Lennie have to go through.  The author I think was trying to make everyone realize that they are people too and they really don't know some of the things that they should and it isn't their fault.  I learned that you should always give people chances no matter who they are or what battles they may be facing in their lives at that time. This novel didn't really remind me of anything it just showed me that everyone deserves a chance and the ability to express themselves in any way they chose and no one should judge them for that.<BR> I felt that this book was very well written and overall just a great book.  It shows you how judgmental and naive some people can be and why you shouldn't be like that.  This gives you a perspective of how people like Lennie feel and what obstacles they have to go through because people won't give them the chance to get to know them.  I learned that know matter who you are you are no better than the people you think are, they in fact are better than you because they unlike you are willing to give you the chance that everyone deserves.
6305513414|5.0|Volume 2 of the Star Trek original series DVD collection contains two episodes that are fairly well known among fans of the show.  Both epsiodes are quite watchable and prove to be rather landmark episodes.  <br />The first episode here is \\"MUDD'S WOMEN\\".  The episode is famous because it has the debut of the Space Rogue Harcourt Fenton Mudd (or just simply Harry Mudd).  The Enterprise is pursuing an unknown ship into an asteroid belt in order to save it's crew before it is destroyed.  Four crew members are beamed aboard space pirate Harry Mudd (played by character actor Roger C. Carmel) and 3 beautiful sultry women.  During the pursuit the Enterprise burned out their lithium crystals which power the ship.  Kirk orders the crew to set their course for Rigel XII a lithium mine.  Mudd finds out there are 3 lonely miners on the planet and decides to scheme his way out of the charges Kirk has placed on him by bribing the miners with the 3 women.  A frustrated Kirk will stop at nothing, to make sure Mudd does not weasel his way out of the charges and to get some lithium crystals in order to save the ship and his crew from destruction.  \\"MUDD'S WOMEN\\" is a decent standard episode but is not one of the series better plots.  It is basically a classic because of Harry Mudd's debut on the show (he would later return in season 2's \\"I, MUDD\\")<br />The second episode here proves Shatner can really act well.  \\"THE ENEMY WITHIN\\" finds the Enterprise's transporter acting up after Technician Fisher(played by Edward Madden)  is beamed aboard from the planet Alpha 177 with a strange magnetic ore on his clothing.  When Kirk is beamed aboard he is split into two different personalities: a kind gentle Kirk and a violent mad Kirk.  As the violent Kirk creeps around the ships causing a few problems the other Kirk realizes he is losing his sense of judgement and is beginning to weaken and Spock later reveals that the two Kirks will have to reunite as one or they will eventually die.<BR>\\"THEENEMY WITHIN\\" is truly one of Season 1 Star Trek's better episodes as Shatner plays both the violent and gentle Kirk very realistically.  <br />Overall Volume 2 is a must for Original Star Trek tv fans.  MUDD'S WOMEN is a standard episode but it marks the comical crook's debut which is rather interesting.  THE ENEMY WITHIN is a classic though and is worth it for this DVD!  Highly recommended!
B00005YW4H|5.0|...I think the reason why is because everyday we're brainwashed with all this radio-friendly music and people afraid to go against the norm that when we hear non-mainstream artists, we often compare them to what we're used to hearing. Norah Jones has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard, a voice that's made to sing lullabies, and she doesn't need to do all that diva shrieking and wailing. The songs, which are mostly about love, get better with each listen.<br />All of the songs are excellent but my personal favorite is \\"The Nearness of You\\". \\"Feelin' the Same Way\\" and \\"Turn Me On\\" are the most upbeat and \\"I've Got to See You Again\\" has a tango vibe. For the pop people, don't get turned off by the country elements because I'm not a big country fan myself but a great song is a great song. Norah and her band blend the jazz, blues, and country perfectly that into a fresh, easy, relaxing sound. I'm glad to see her album selling so well in the U.S. and in Europe. It shows the Britneys and Limp Bizkits have not taken over and Norah has not even had a big radio hit yet because she doesn't need one. The music speaks for itself.

B00000J6AG|5.0|Super-talented Moby writes, engineers, mixes, produces and plays all the instruments on &quot;Play&quot;, which is quite worthy of all the recognition and praise it has received. He samples memorable phrases from old vinyl blues records and seamlessly lines them with catchy beats (&quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Find My Baby&quot;, &quot;Run On&quot;). He expresses his love for soul ballads with use of gospel singers (&quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?&quot;) and samples (&quot;Natural Blues&quot;) over piano and cinematic synthesized strings. Several instrumental tracks are present along with a few disco tunes. This is an essential record because Moby takes pop or whatever you want to call it to another level.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This low-budget black and white film, is one of the funniest movies of our time.  Jeff Anderson as &quot;Randal Graves&quot; plays a frustrated video rental store clerk next to &quot;Dante Hicks&quot; Brian O'Halloran's convenience store.  This duo is absolutely hilarious, and not to mention Jay and Silent Bob.  This is a classic in my book.
B000068TP0|5.0|This is Shakira at her best, her voice at top form before the awful english CD.  The best songs she had were in Spanish, she plays, sings like Janis Joplin and even belly dances on an extended version of \\"ojos asi\\".  Check it out, you won't forget the performance!
B000063S6Z|5.0|I've listened to this CD 20 times now and it still mystifies you.<br />Amazing classic mood music recording.
0451163540|4.0|I read this book looking for some post 9/11 escapism focused on the middle east. This is a fast moving action story that maintains its pace through all 340 pages. Follett has created an unforgettable character in Nat Dickstein, who in many ways is a metaphor for Israel herself. He has found a way to leave his hatred behind, yet methodically pursues his aims by any means necessary, looking hopefully towards a peaceful future.<BR>In my view this is as good as &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, and maybe better than &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; which I thought was overlong. Follett shows us the Israelis, Egyptians and Russians all in a bright light, where it is the ends, and not the means, that counts.
B00000J7RZ|3.0|When 'On The 6' first came out J-Lo was known as Jennifer Lopez and more famous for her impressive acting skills in intelligent movies such as Stephen Soderbergh's 'Out Of Sight'.  Yet with her debut single 'If You Had My Love' she proved that she didn't only have a sexy image and great flair but could also turn out some of the best material in the Latin-pop revolution which coincided with Ricky Martin's popularity.  Looking back at her early career, J-Lo has become a massive star very quickly and as such this album becomes more interesting in retrospect.<br />The unfortunate thing is that when J-Lo does it well, she does it very well, and all of her singles are testament to this, whereas she has a tendancy towards filler.  What comes out is a good enough album but nothing spectacular.  The highlights are without doubt the singles 'If You Had My Love', 'Waiting For Tonight' and 'Feelin' So Good', which also has a slight R&B edge to it.  Jennifer's obviously having more fun on the up tempo tracks, such as 'Let's Get Loud', where her teasing style and sense of fun come into play effectively.  There's also a few ballads here that aren't half bad, although it's universally known that sweet tunes such as 'Should've Never' and 'Promise Me You'll Try' are best reserved for album tracks.  There's sparkling potential here and as a debut album it puts J-Lo rightly at the forefront of the Latin-pop revolution, but as a whole it's good rather than spectacular.
B000003S0P|5.0|WOW!!!! This album is the definition of progressive rock. Fusions of advent garde guitars and lyrics to jazz to some influences of metal is what makes this an undeniable classic progressive rock album. If you don't know anything about the genre of progressive rock or generally do not like prog rock this a must have for any true music lover. Starless is the best song on this album, a perfect way to close out this classic.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I can't Stand some people telling you that the only good song is Clint Eastwood. Sure Clint Eastwood is a great song, but other ones like 19-2000 amd Latin Simone are great too! Starshine has a great guitar chorus for example. Altogether, the whole CD Is great and not slotted into genres
B00005QDW5|5.0|This a great start for someone who wants to begin listening to Pink Floyd. Each song flows so naturally to the next. With the depth of their collection, not every classic Floyd song is on here, but they can't all fit or would not work as well.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|Before I saw Akira, the only Anime's I'd ever heard of were Speed Racer, Sailor Moon and Pokemon. Now that I've seen Akira, my horizons have broadened so much that I've forgotten the earlier 3. Akira is the single most amazing Anime I've ever seen! Its animation is flawles and character development perfect. It walks the fine line between good and evil. The end just leaves you wondering...<br />If you only ever see one Anime, (which I doubt will happen after seeing this msterpiece)see Akira, and be amazed. You won't regret it. I sure didn't!

B00006690F|5.0|I never thought I'd review an Eminem album. \\"The Eminem Show\\" is impressive. What grabbed me was the plain wit of \\"Without Me'.<br />I'll say frankly it is not for everyone. I disagree with some of what he says, and sometimes the way he says it. However, Em has the skills as a songwriter and lays down some solid vocal tracks.<br />His singing-rap style is infectous. I like it. Rather than screaming out words in old patterned rhymes, he brings a new voice and rhythm to lyrics. He has more to say than thug music, and seems to be moving forward with his ideas.<br />Maybe Eminem is on his way to becoming one of the ones who will last, and maybe his songs will be good enough to be covered by later artists. Or, will his tunes be the ones sampled, like he picks up on a Aerosmith song. I can see the potential.<br />I recommend checking out \\"The Eminem Show.\\"<br />Anthony Trendl
0571212689|5.0|This book covers more or less every aspect of classical drawn animation, and almost all the techniques are directly transferrable to 3d animation aswell, plenty of examples of walkcycles, runcycles, takes, accents etc. <BR>More than everything this book makes you realize that animation is 'simple' but hard work :)
B00005YW4H|4.0|I work in a very noisey, chaotic enviornment.  When I need to tune out the world and tune into my own strength to get something done, I pop this CD into my computer, don my headphones and I am immediately at ease and the work flows like nobody's business.  It's soothing, calming, and the epitome of relaxation.  I feel as though I have been transported away from 25 other co-workers trapped in a field of cubicles and into a convertable on a warm summer's day, driving through the desert at sunset!
B00005QIPH|2.0|Don't get me wrong, their sound is very original and comes fresh compared to the overproduced bands nowadays. But there is WAY too much hype about these guys, I'm sure even the band itself will agree with me on that! I do like the back-to-the-roots snotty Rock attitude but what really bothers me is the overuse of the &quot;distorted voice&quot; effect. It's cool on Last Night but they use it on every single song on the album. It gets old, man!!
0780622650|3.0|My family and I saw this movie at the theater when it opened and enjoyed it enough to buy the video. I'm now considering the DVD. Why? Because even though this isn't a steller science fiction film it is a lot of fun.Don't trust the fans of the dreadful series to be objective (I watched this series' first run as a kid and was a dedicated viewer and I still came to the conclusion that it was space magic drek). Don't trust the former actors on the old series to like the new handling. I don't hold a grudge against them because they're going to be nostalgic in their recall. The series was not good. Even though I liked the main actors, their acting, and the show's premise, this movie is better.While the special effects seem to be the star here I like the family's struggle to become.... a family. In the beginning we see the typical parental neglect that children recieve these days as well as the parents always promising to make up for it. The parents have good intentions but both of the folks are scientists, with one a celebrity of sorts whose trying to save the entire population of the planet (even though that population is not aware of how bad things really are), and the other parent (scientist/mom) organizing the family's departure from the planet on a mission to build the second half of a stargate at the other end to bring the population through to a new homeworld (the gate will utilize the means to navigate ships with hyperdrive engines so they won't get lost and cut that travel time to almost nothing, unlike the Jupiter2 which will travel by conventional sub light speeds). This is an awfully big ambitious setting for a normal family and needless to say the stress is showing. I like this story even if it's streamlined (probably) for gala special effects.By the end of their first misadventure they are a real family. They rely on each other and appreciate their place in the family.Good stuff: While some of the characterization is not as potent as it could be it is goodenough and sometimes very well done given the fact that this is a science fiction adventure inspired by a bad TV series.The special effects are dazzling and well placed.The science is inspired by our latest interpretations of cosmology as well as utilizing those to good effect.Matt LeBlanc was fun to watch and a very different character than those typecast dumb Italian hunk roles that seem to predominate his acting resume'. The bad stuff: The technology, as one reviewer mentioned already, is a bit too high tech for the time period at the rate of our current pace.While I like the terrorist subplot a little more information would have been good.Not enough time is spent explaining the mission's goals much less it's risks.The wrap-up of the story with the older Will was slow and then rushed (like a Star Trek episode using those cliche' last minute saves). I also had little sympathy for that character (are all movie dads supposed to feel quilty for the stupid assumptions their kids make?).I don't like the CGI pet. It's not very convincingly rendered and is an annoyance rather than comic relief. It should have been done better and provided the viewer a sense of kinship with the lost crew since it shared their need for family ties. There will most likely be no sequels so enjoy this romp with a little heart if not a huge audience.
B00004W52U|5.0|good gosh, if you dont own this cd already you've been deprived, and thats all i can say.  i bought it maybe three years ago because i was starting to get curious about all those people wearing the opiv t-shirts.  i brought the cd home, ripped it out of the shrink-wrap, and stuck it in my cd player.  it blew me away. it rocked my head so hard i couldn't stand up.  i had never heard music like that before, and i dont think i ever will from any other band.  operation ivy was one of the greatest bands that ever existed, and the fact that they were only around from 87-89 only feeds the legacy.. had they gone on, they may have lost some of that flavor, that world-shattering, revolutionary blend of punk and ska, that amazing energy.. hence the title of the album i suppose.  i cant even really think of the words to describe this cd, but please trust me on this one- go out and buy it.  if you dont like it, give it to a friend- you'll have done something for the betterment of a society drowing in crappy music.
6305265666|5.0|I believe everyone knows the story of Cinderalla---who wouldn't?  As a child, I have read the story several times.  In fact, it was the 1st fairy tale story I read.  Then came the cartoon theatre release, & I saw it several times as well.  To a child's simple mind & heart, Cinderella embodies the fulfillment of a quite forsaken dream.<br />Now that I am a mother & am retelling the story to my daughter,I am quite critical of the character. I find the cartoon 'Cinderella' character quite pathetic.  Yes, truthful & naive but too soft.<br />Now, Daniella is what I have in mind as the perfect Cinderella.  If I were the prince, I would not fall for a lady-in-distress type of maiden.  I would look for someone who has guts, intelligence & strength - both physically & emotionally.  Yes, Drew/Daniella's physical built was bigger than the ideal fair-framed but hers was more realistic.  If you were made to work on the fields like a slave, you would grow strong & rough.  <br />Ever After, despite its slightly different portrayal of a long-known fairy tale character, retained its charm & appeal to folks of both gender & of all ages.  I am no Drew Barrymore fan but I just loved her as Daniella a.k.a Cinderella.
0140277447|5.0|The book itself was extremely well written and documented. I'd recommend to everyone and anyone interested in history and doesn't mind extremely detailed descriptions of this horrific atrocity. This book portrays the ugly truth like it was. I'd just like to point out, isn't it funny how most of the bad reviews of this book belong to Japanese people? The same people whose ancestors committed this shameful crime... please do not try to hide the truth by insulting this book.
0345298349|5.0|I found this book, hardback (first edition, second reprinting) in a charity shop for 49 pence (approx 75 cents US). Heard about the book and film, thought I should buy because I was going to the laundry that night.<br />It was hard to put down. The intrigues, the complex plot and a richly expressed tapestry of Moscow and Muscovites. <br />It was rich in Characters, Dialogue, Plot and Sub-plots. I took it on trains, on busses, in laundries everywhere there was an opportunity to read.<br />It was great having a hardbook, it made me appreciate books much more than I usually do.<br />Gorky Park has to go down as a modern classic, in a hundred years time, I guess, people will still be reading this. <br />Check out your local charity shops, you'll never know what you may find. In the meantime, buy this book here.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I remember after seeing Episode I at the theater in 1999, I thought it was the biggest disappointment in cinematic history.  At the time, the only actor/character I liked was Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala.  The most poignant memory of the movie in my head was Ewan MacGregor delivering the corniest lines in the movie (&quot;You were right about one thing, the negotiations WERE short&quot;) with an even cornier look on his face.  I also remember disliking Jar Jar Binks, but not all that much.<br />After seeing and enjoying Episode II, my Star Wars interest was piqued again to a crazed level for the first time since fifth grade.  So, I bought the Episode I DVD just because I didn't want to be missing any of the episodes in my movie collection.  I watched it again, remembering how boring the podrace sequence was and how corny and cartoonish the big battle at the end was ... but then, I was surprised!  I was genuinely enjoying the movie more than Episode II.  The podrace was more exciting than I remembered, the CGI creatures and real life humans blended together seamlessly, corny lines from Obi-Wan were a generally miniscule part of the movie, and Jar Jar was almost likeable.  I recommend giving Episode I a second chance, and make sure to watch it on the DVD.
B000002A3T|4.0|Even as this is not a popular Floyd album, it still ranks as a great album.  We've become so used to it, that we become quick to criticize the Division Bell.  No, it is not their best album, but it certainly ranks above Momentary Lapse of Reason, Final Cut, Animals and a few others.  This is great-but-not-super-great album.  Pink Floyd has become popular for their slow, sedating, put-you-to-sleep rock.  This album is no exception.  Yes, it lacks some creativity that Roger Waters would have brought, but it still does a good job of illustrating its point of seperation.  The album even cracks on Roger a few times.  This is just another good Floyd album, along with all the rest.  All in all, its just another brick in the wall of great Pink Floyd albums.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This CD is tight.  Way 2 sik.  I don't ever write reviews, but when I read all the hating going on, I had to say something.  This is definitely at the top of No Doubt's releases.  Saying that they're not original because they've changed up their style a little bit is ridiculous.  Tell me of another band that mixes reggae, rock, pop, r&amp;b, and ska together so perfectly.  When I first got this cd I never took it out of my cd player--seriously.  And, what's up with saying that no good cd ever had an intro, lol.  That's just a very meaningless comment.  Besides that intro itself offers to the originality of the CD.  When you play the CD over and over again like I did, you begin to appreciate little things like the circularity of the last song and the intro.  Every single song on this CD is tight.  4 real....every single song.
B000002U82|5.0|As ever with early Pink Floyd, all for members' maverick talents are in full flow on darkside of the Moon (Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall and The Final Cut, masterpieces as they are, lack the experimental, communal quality which gave the early albums so much of their uniqueness - not that The Wall isn't unique) but this time around the band have the focus of a truly groundbreaking concept. Roger Waters provides cascades of lyrical insight and, as you might expect, the music is pretty awe-inspiring stuff. The breath-taking soundscapes of thrilling, acid-drenched improvisations, stunning compositions and startlingly effective experiments (especially the vocals of \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and the intro to \\"Time\\") are the equal of Dark Side of the Moon's conceptual genius.<BR>The album begins with a gripping build-up of sound effects. The voices, the tick-tocks and the alarm bells get louder and louder until the sound of a roller coaster going up a hill reaches it's crescendo, Doris Troy screams and you are plunged into a flowing, psychedelic melody. Before you know it the lyrics, \\"for long you live and high you fly and smiles you give and tears you cry and all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be\\", come pouring out of the speakers. Without pausing, the album runs as a single compelling composition for forty minutes, defining life more artistically than is comprehendable.<BR>Quite why this album sold so many copies is almost as big a mystery as how Pink Floyd managed to make such an album. Fashionability, I suppose, is the only answer as the record buying public are not renowned for their good taste. Though more focussed than earlier works, Darkside has all the depth and off-the-wall experimental spirit that an avant garde' freak like me could hope for in a record. It also has the warm, textural ambience of Rick's keyboards, the subtle groove of Nick's drumming, the emotion of Dave's guitar work and Dick Parry's saxophone, the flawless use offemale backing vocals and the irresistable beat of \\"Money\\".<BR>This really is an absolute masterpiece, but please don't forget, it's by no means the Floyd's first masterpiece, I urge you to hear this and the rest of Pink Floyd's albums and enjoy the wonderful originality of the music. It may not always be \\"Rock'n'Roll\\" (God bless it) but it sure is good!<BR>And who can resist an album that bears no name, tracklisting or band name and such a good cover?<BR>I know that's why I bought it and thank goodness I did.

B000065U1N|2.0|Although this was not a bad &quot;action&quot; movie, it was a very poor translation of a book that was a fairly accurate look at a conflict that was barely noticed by most people. Everybody can recall the images of dead Americans being desecrated by the Somalis, but what the book covered was the story behind the conflict, and it's participants. What I didn't like about the movie was the combining of some characters, and the omission or downplaying of others. I didn't get a feel for any of the characters in the movie. They all seemed very thin, whereas the book fleshes them out quite a bit more. Also, the tension between the different units stationed in Somalia, not there at all. In all fairness, had the movie mirrored the book, it would have been about as long as the battle itself, with hundreds of characters, and a cast of thousands. Bravo for making an almost honest movie about an unpopular conflict, but  as for me, I'd like it a little more like the book.

079284632X|4.0|This movie was proven to be one of a kind. It was the debut movie of Wes Craven.Two teenage girls,going to a concert,are kidnapped by four vicious criminals. They are raped and eventually by these criminals.They eventually take refuge in a house which is occupied by the parents of the criminals victims.<BR>When the parents figure out what the foursome have done they exact revenge.The mother's method that she uses on one of the thugs by the lake is classical. An intense film that will hold your attention.You will not forget it.
6304602979|5.0|This movie is an unforgettable thrill ride from start to finish.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are phenominal as the flawed heroes.  Gary Oldman is great as the inner-city pimp and drug dealer.  You'd never know he's British from his accent here!  In addition to being packed with action and great dialogue, this movie contains two of the best scenes ever made in Hollywood.  The first is an intense showdown between Clarence (Slater) and Drexel (Oldman) as Clarence shows up at Drexel's place to retrieve his newlywed bride Alabama's (Arquette) things.  He's packing heat because of a conversation he had with \\"Elvis\\" in his bathroom.  This scene will leave you stupified.  The second scene takes place in Clarence's father's (Dennis Hopper) trailer when a mob boss (Christopher Walken) shows up looking for Clarence.  Walken introduces himself to Hopper in classic Tarantino style - \\"I am the antichrist.  You tell the angels in Heaven that you have never seen evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you.\\"  This is an absolute MUST own, MUST watch and rewatch.  They don't make them much better than this!
B00005QDW1|1.0|I understand and appreciate bands' needs to grow and evolve out of the styles that propelled them into stardom.  Of course, this change is sometimes hard to accept, especially when diehards have become accustomed and attached to a certain style.  Having said that, this album falls FLAT.  It sounds like every other bit of junk R&amp;B I avoid when cruising the dial.
B000002R0P|5.0|is greatly overlooked for some reason. The title track is in the great GG tradition. Just listen to the piano in the instrumental before the &quot;whispers&quot; (it sounds like King Crimson's on Cat Food) - it's sheer brilliance. Give It Back is probably the most difficult to like. Design is of a great design of vocals and drums. Empty City is a very good GG as well as Timing. I Lost My Head is a real masterpiece, similar in structure to the In The Glass House title track. Interview and I Lost My Head are my favorites. It's their last great record and it will certainly satisfy the most discriminating and serious listener.
0316776963|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is a often hilarious book of collections of essays written by the author.  It is beautifully written and captivating.  The book is somewhat of a tragic comedy, beginning with his inability to pronounce the letter `s' due to a lisp.  Going from that, the audience peers into his off center life.  Strong descriptions and a real looks on life pulls the reader into the book until the last page.

B000065U1N|5.0|This is cartainly the best war film I have seen since Saving Private Ryan or The Patriot. I just read a review by someone who said that the plot was unrealistic and that the characters were too \\"made up\\". Well, that person should realize that these events ACTUALLY HAPPENED and that the movie is based on Mark Bowden's book of the same name. The book contains most all of the facts from the actual event. The actions taken by such men as Randy Shughart and Gary Gordon (the Delta Force operators who single handedly went in on a suicide mission to defend downed chopper pilot Mike Durand) were real events, but some people fail to recognize this and dismiss their heroic actions as stupid. If you truly want to appreciate what a brilliant job Ridley Scott did, than I would highly suggest reading the book first. Ignorant people, like that reviewer, make me sick because they don't know that this story really took place on October 3, 1993, and that a lot of our guys actually fought and died over there. The fact that they had some of the men who actually fought in the battle as consultants on the movie shows their true intention to keep the movie as \\"real\\" as possible. The graphic combat depictions are terrifying and the plot exposition gives you just enough to know what is going on. The ensemble cast did a brilliant job showing the fear and helplessness that some of the men felt, while at the same time showing the brave and selfelss acts that the men realized that they needed to do to survive. The movie could have easily taken over three hours to show everything that happened, but Scott keeps it down to just over two hours. The point that I really want to make is that everyone should see this movie to truly appreciate the sacrifice that our Special Forces (the Army Rangers and the Delta Force) made in Somalia. <BR>       <BR>The only flaw in this movie is that they don't point out which character is which as much as they should.
B00006690F|5.0|This is the best album I have ever heard. I got it last week and I haven't stopped listening to it since. Eminem definetly improved his lyrics over his other CDs and I like all of the songs, but especially \\"Hailie's Song.\\" I think that is his best song on the CD, and one of his best ever. \\"Without Me\\" is hilarious, and I love White America, Business, Cleaning Out My Closet, Superman, and My Dad's Gone Crazy. (Actually, I like them all.) You have to get this CD because it is the best ever.
0451198492|2.0|2001: A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke was very confusing at the beginning because the cover shows a man in a space helmet and on the back it shows some type of spaceship leaving a docking station in the middle of space. But in the beginning the book it is about these apes that live on earth and how they fight to survive. After looking at the cover and the title I thought what does this have to do with space? <BR> In my opinion 2001: A Space Odyssey would get two stars (out of five) from me because half of the time I was lost or if I wasn't lost I was bored out of my mind. After the first couple of chapters it started to make sense when Dr. Floyd travels from Earth to the Moon to cure an epidemic on the Moon. That was about the only part of the book that made sense at all. When Dr. Floyd got to the Moon the author, Arthur C. Clarke was describing how people had to walk and it was so confusing I had to read it over about three times because I couldn't understand what he was saying. <BR> Then the Discovery which is the ship goes on a mission to the farthest planet in the solar system with Hal which is a chatty computer that guides your life and the course that the Discovery is headed in. Hal takes over the Discovery and the only human on board tries to take back control of the space ship. In order to find out what happens you have to read the book.

You'll miss all the humor and there is a lot of it in this book, \\"The True Story Of The Three Little Pigs\\", by A. Wolf (the actual wolf) as told to Jon Scieszka.<br />Find out how the famous line, \\"I'll huff and puff and blow your house down\\" got started. Alexander T. Wolf (the big bad wolf)tells his side of the story from inside the big house (The Pig Pen). You'll be amazed at what really happened.<br />What an imaginative story. I wish I could have thought of it. Even though this picture book, with beautiful illustrations by Lane Smith, is for kids 3-8, I think adults will also get a kick out of it. It's a perfect bed-time story. The original Three Little Pigs was more of a suspense story (maybe even a little scary) but this book is full of laugh-out-loud humor.
0140177396|5.0|After being chased from one job, George and Lennie find themselves alongside the road walking to their next job.  Day after day George takes care of his friend Lennie who is a monstrous man with a mental illness.  Lennie can hardly remember but one thing and that is the rabbits he hopes to tend.<br />      The hard times that George and Lennie have earning the little bit they can is hard enough, let alone this novel is during the Great Depression.  The struggles they have can pull you into the novel.  Would this novel be as good as it is if Lennie did not have a mental illness?<br />      I feel that this novel would not be the novel it is without the illness Lennie has.  when George and Lennie get to their next job there are all kinds of things that are waiting to get them in trouble.  First they show up late to work because of the bus driver, then they meet a small man that has an attitude whose name is Curley.  Then Curley's wife comes around.  She is a big flirt that catches Lennie's eyes.  Lennie has a problem keeping his hands off of pretty soft things.  These two people alone cause George and Lennie the most trouble.  On the other hand George is able to become friends and gain trust with another worker named Slim.  <br />      Being the way that Lennie is Curley finds some way to pick a fight with him.  This creates some tension within the novel.  Then when things seemed to be settled down Lennie finds himself in the barn talking to Curley's wife.  If Lennie had enough sense he would not have gotten into a struggle with her.  Because of this Lennie and George find themselves in the same situation they were in before.  George finally realizes that this can't go on any longer and has to do something himself.  <br />      I find this to be a very excellent novel to read.  The characters are very likable and you can become easily attached.  Without Lennie being the way he is this novel would just be some novel about two guys that worked on a farm.  Lennie's character makes this novel as memorable as it is.

In this enstallment, Claire is in her own time and its twenty years later from the time she first went back (1945)and she has a daughter from Jamie, Brianna who is 20 years old.<br />Claire is now a succesful doctor living in Boston and still longs for her lost love, a Scottish warrior from the 18th century named Jamie Fraser.  Her twentieth century husband Frank having passed away two years ago, Claire is feeling that heartwrenching pull to return to her love.<br />But how does a mother leave her only child to find a man she once knew and loved almost two hundred years ago?  How does she explain this to the man's daughter who looks just like him?  Just seeing Brianna makes her heart ache for Jamie.<br />With the help of Brianna and a friend who studies genealogy charts, Claire finds out that Jamie somehow survived the bloody Battle of Culloden!  Dare she risk another trip through the stones to find him?<br />With understanding and the love from her daughter, Claire finds the support and courage she needs to take the plunge into the unknown with the knowledge that she may never again be able to return to the future and Brianna.<br />Seeing Jamie again nearly knocks the breath from her.  Their love is still intact, even 20 years later.  Trouble is still in the air, this time they are uprooted from the battlefields of Scotland to the exotic and mysterious West Indies.  Coming face-to-face with an 18th century serial killer, Claire is the only one who can stop the madness.<br />Voodoo magic and political intrigue, Claire and Jamie are thrust on a voyage to the pits of humanity and must use their love and trust in one another to survive.<br />I thought the use of voodoo and the islands in the 1700's was unbelievable!  It was so fascinating and kept you on your toes!  Their journey through the world of magic and greed for life made sense and also explained things to me that I missed in the first novel 'Outlander'.  The stones are more in depthly explained along with the travel of time.  It was so unbelievable that I was engrossed for hours and hours and found it dark outside before I thought to even eat!<br />This is probably one of my favorites so far of the three I've read.  It moved faster and with more excitement that the last (even though I loved 'Dragonfly') and I was sad to see it end, some 1050 pages later, lol.<br />The time spent apart made the heart grow fonder and I was happy to see the passion still well alive between them.  I love Jamie anyway, and fell in love with him in 'Outlander', but in this, I loved him even more and wished I were Claire, lol.

B00005JKZT|5.0|Okay, I feel as if I'm talking to a bunch of my friends, because I know you are all as anxious to see \\"The Two Towers\\" as I am, but I'm a little worried...<br />I was impressed by the preview, and by all of the still shots that I've managed to track down online.  But there's one thing that worries me, and has worried me since before \\"Fellowship of the Rings\\" came out...that being the entirely computer-generated Gollum.<br />Now the CGI worked in \\"Fellowship,\\" but you've got to admit that they kept Gollum in the shadows for the most part...we never had to look at a CGI Gollum in the cold light of day!!!  The fact is, characters in CGI rarely FEEL real, and actors who try to interact with what amounts to a computer blip usually fail!  I'm not judging this movie before seeing it (I'm pretty sure I'll love it!), but the shot of Gollum crawling down the rocks in the preview did NOT impress me...it looked digital.  If there was ever a character in the history of digital effects that ached to have life breathed into it, that deserved to be believable, it is Gollum.  If, when Frodo is talking to Gollum in \\"The Two Towers,\\" it FEELS as if he's talking to a tennis ball, or if his eyes seem to be looking in slightly the wrong direction, it could very easily kill the atmosphere, the characters, and the movie. <br />Lets all cross our fingers, and hope Jackson creates a digital miracle!

0780626966|2.0|I agree with the 12 years old reviewer below. cause I am also a fan of Hammer horror classical films in the 50s and 60s and included of course the mario brava films, they have alots of literature significance. But these Nightmare/ FREDDY Series mean nothing to get the value of the classic horror literature like what the Hammer british horror films or Brava films had done in the past 40 years. These modern Hollywood horror series only showing the violences, ignorances and the brutes without having any interrest in the significance of classical qualified literature like perhaps Boris Karrloff, bela lugosi or Vincent price ever did in the post war period in the 40s.
1587990717|5.0|This book presents a highly entertaining and informative view of the role of probability in the markets as well as in daily situations, and Taleb will often force you to crack an amused smile and nod with agreement at the same time.  The book explores the idea that human beings are not wired to think rationally, and how we therefore misinterpret many events in life.  I am no less than shocked that the book has received so many harsh reviews; and I ask anyone who considers not purchasing it to consider that the following points no doubt apply to many of the people who gave it any less than 4 stars.<BR>1) If you want a technical work on finance, read Taleb's 'Dynamic Hedging.' In 'Fooled by Randomness' he intentionally writes so that people outside of the fields of finance and math can understand it.  These reviews that attack it for diluting certain points are therefore ridiculous and miss the very point of the book.<BR>2) Since this book's thesis states that many people who think they rose to power or wealth actually did so out of pure luck, of course many people are going to react with hostility and will not want you to read it.  Any scathing reviews are no doubt therefore people who don't want you to realize the truth about them.<BR>3) The book is not arrogant.  I have trouble seeing how so many can describe it as egotistical when one of Taleb's main points is that he knows nothing about how the markets will act, and that the only thing that seperates him from most people is that he realizes this lack of knowledge, and designs his strategies accordingly.  My contention is that it is inevitable that anyone who goes against the common theories will be labeled as arrogant, which is why so many view Taleb as so.<BR>4) Taleb is right.  September 11th, the Russian collapse, the interent bubble; the markets are ruled by sudden rare events and you ignore them at your own risk.  <BR>I therefore implore you to not listen to all this silly reviews that attack it for entirelygroundless reasons.  Taleb is one of just a few members of the derivatives theory hall of fame; other members include Nobel Prize winners Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, who derived the famous Black-Scholes formula.  What he has to say is worth listening to.

Complicated relationships and personal struggles in the characters portay life as it is. East of Eden is a book which discusses human nature.It looks into the hearts and minds of people, revealing both the good and bad that battles within a person.It stresses individuality and the hardships of life as well as the joy that can be found in living.He portrays numerous characters, each unique, developing them and describing the struggles and personality, revealing both strengths and weaknesses,just like any other person. Stuggles such as rejection, longing for love, ignorance, blindness from love, search of identity, shame and guilt, anger, and many more are expanded on and looked into.It brings understanding to the reader of differnt issues and patters in people.  The story is well developed and written, containing much thought and insight.It starts with differnt stories but craftily intertwines as the story progessed, developing into a complicated web of relationships and lives. Many connections are made throughout the book, making the book a complete whole with constant substance, bringing it to life.This book contains a lot of useful information and insight that can even be applied to the reader's own life. It may allow greater understanding and personal growth. This book is definitely worth reading. It is by far my favorite book.
0440219078|3.0|The plot is acting in a fictional world in the future, where the people -tired of wars and diseases- live in such called \\"communities\\". Small villages. They where able, because of scientific development to use \\"climate control\\" and \\"terraforming\\", to build the world, like they wanted to. In their community, they abolished things like, weather (because of bad weather), hills and mountains (because of the risk of falling down), colors (because they wanted to get all thing unitary). The people in the community, have to stick to a lot of rules. The main character Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, was chosen for the most important job in the whole community. He is going to get the new Receiver of Memory, who is reminding all the thing of the past, the other people don't want to know. During the process of his training by the Giver of Memory, all the dark secrets of the community were revealed to them. He and the Giver make a plan to change the life of the people again, to the way it was in the past.<br />The book is good to imagine. The world that is described, has a lot of good sides, but the dark sides of that way of living are very scary to us.
B000000OUW|1.0|I am a die hard Manowar fan. They are the best heavy metal band in existance.  Every recording they have produced is excellent with 6 or 7 great songs.  Louder than Hell is the exception.  It is by far Manowar's worst album.  There are no real good songs on this recording.  The songs seem to have been written from a formula or template.  They are are boring.  Even after many listens I think the whole ablum is terrible.  I recommend Hail to England, Fighting the World, and Sign of the Hammer for those new to Manowar.
B00006690G|5.0|As being a massive fan of Eminem , every of you can think I won't do an objective review to this cd but you are wrong.The Slim Shady LP is the worst Eminem cd but The Eminem Show is the best Eminem cd so far.Why? Simply because Eminem Show does not follow the two previous albums and niether his previous works. Without a doubt , Eminem Show is taking his music one step further to evolution.Eminem uses a different method in this album and with opening White America you can understand this difference:Rock background.Many tracks do not match with his previous style but still he has some tracks for his devoted fans and for those who think that Eminem only raps like his first single 'Without Me' , 'When The Music Stops' feat. D12 and 'Till I Collapse' feat. Dr Dre.The highlights of the album sure are not these tracks because Eminem just repeates himself in these tracks.'White America' , 'Cleaning Out My Closet' , 'Sing For The Moment' , 'Soldier' are the tracks that Eminem finds time to show his anger but in a hip hop &rock mixture. 'Hailie's Song' and 'My Dad's Gone Crazy' shows Eminem can sing too (but only for his daughter).'Say Goodbye To Hollywood' , 'Sing For The Moment' are the best of all.So for those who are massive Eminem fans , you will definitely gonna like the album after a short term shock and for those who do not enjoy his music , probably not gonna buy the album when they hear 'Without Me' (I can not blame them for this)but they will change their mind after hearing great forthcoming singles...
B000005RSW|5.0|This is a great ablum as is customary for Manowar.  Mountains is very majestic and awe inspiring.  The Oath is heavy, fast, and has great vocals.  Guyana is my favorite, but I can't really describe it.  I strongly recommend this album as well as Hail to England and Fighting the World.
B000065U1N|5.0|If you are a war movie buff or not, this movie is worth seeing and keeping.  It is the ultimate of war movies, where winning or losing is not the theme, where there is no glamourizing of war, and there are no super heroic scenes that we often see in Hollywood creations.  This is a soldier's movie and does not exploit any part of moviemaking in order to make its point, which is, war is ugly, brutal, and unmistakably unpredictable.  This movie captures all that is unglorious of urban, modern, combat and achieves its main underlying antiwar theme.
B00005B36H|5.0|One of the most intellegent, unique, and sophisticated cd's I have ever heard.  Tool's music is just like great lovemaking...they tease you by giving you little by little...slowly building up to a gratifying climax and when you get there...mindblowing!  And then, of course, they do it all over again.  <br />This is a band that has been on an upward spiral since the release of their first EP Opiate.  Lateralus is a testement to just how much Tool's sound has matured and improved.  While listening to this cd, it is all to obvious just how much thought was put into every note in every song.  A must buy for any self-respecting music fan.
B000002AS3|4.0|It's honestly hard to like Oasis sometimes because they're so darn full of themselves. It's bad enough that the Beatles proclaimed they were bigger than God, now we have to listen to Liam say they're bigger than the Beatles?!?<br />If you can get past the grating personalities, they do put out some fantastic music, admittedly. And this album, albeit a bit streaky, does show flashes of brilliance that warrents a purchase.<br />Most noteable are \\"Live Forever\\" (still brings tears to my eyes thinking about a friend who died in a car crash years ago), \\"Rock N Roll Star\\" and \\"Supersonic.\\" But the cornerstone is \\"Married With Children,\\" with a simple melody guaranteed to stick in your head, bitingly sarcastic and hilarious lyrics, and a singalong factor that's a perfect ***10***. It's a freaking great song, and I urge you to track it down one way or another even if you don't buy the album. I think this saying is cliche', but really true in this case: the song is worth the purchase of the whole album.
B000002Q88|2.0|This album was produced by Bob Ezrin, who also produced classic Alice Cooper and Pink Floyd's The Wall.  A lot of this album actually ends up sounding like a bad imitation of The Wall.  There are direct copies of Dave Gilmore's licks.<br />Pink Floyd is not the only group copied here.  There are bits that sound like Yes.  Most of the vocals are that screeching kind that was popular in corporate rock in the late eighties.  Similar to groups like Foriegner or Journey.  <br />Steve Morse plays guitar on this album.  He is been a great addition to the band, especially for their live shows.  He does have some nice moments, but spends a lot of time imitating others like Gilmore and Steve Howe.  Note that Morse has moved on to Deep Purple.<br />Some people have raved about Rainmaker.  But, I found it to be one worst, most pretentious songs Kansas has ever done.<br />In the eighties, many classic groups from the seventies tried to change their sound to match the times and get a hit.  Most failed.  There are a few good songs on this album, but not enough to recommend it.
B00005LB9O|4.0|I read a review about this type of music that stated &quot;Quiet is the new Loud.&quot; Wha--? While that doesn't make much sense, what would make sense is for you to check this out, along with similar albums such as Badly Drawn Boy's &quot;Hour of the Bewilderbeast&quot; and Coldplay's &quot;Parachutes.&quot;<br />Fran and Co. are really evolving into a highly addictive band. Their prior album set the stage, and &quot;Invisible Band&quot; proves that they aren't a &quot;one and done&quot; sort of band. While past reviewers don't pit this favorably against an album like &quot;OK Computer,&quot; I think &quot;Invisible Band&quot; proves this feat can be possible from Travis down the stretch. The band alternates between infectious pop and moody ballads: by that measure, this album stacks up well with The Counting Crows' &quot;August and Everything After.&quot;<br />There really are two clunkers on this album: &quot;Dear Diary&quot; (Fran whines... Dear diary/ What's wrong with me?) and &quot;The Humpty Dumpty Love Song.&quot; Highlights are many, from the singles like &quot;Side&quot; and &quot;Sing&quot;, to Beatlesesque &quot;Flowers In the Window&quot; to brooding songs like &quot;Last Train.&quot; And the &quot;hidden track&quot; titled &quot;Ring Out The Bell&quot; could be the best song on the album and one of my personal favorite songs of 2001. Really ache-ingly sad but really, really beautiful lyrics and music.<br />I don't know if this one will go down among the all-time greats in the world of BritPop, but if you are a fan of the genre (again, Coldplay's probably the closest relative) this definitely warrents a listen.
B000066C1N|5.0|\\"Here I am\\" is one of the most emotionally moving songs ever written. Half of our movie theatre was in tears. \\"Brothers\\" is another very moving song.

B00005JKL8|3.0|I originally thought that Owen Wilson was miscast to play this part, but I gave it a chance. As it turns out though, I wasn't far off. David Kieth (who plays a fellow military man ... again) could have done a much better job in Wilson's role. Gene Hackman gave his usual great performance, but its not enough to save this film. The ending was just too much to swallow, even for the feeble minded movie-goer.<br />So why give it 3 stars? The special effects are great, especially the aero battle. The story of a man down behind enemy lines, and not being &quot;allowed&quot; to give rescue is an old but good one as well.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Okay - so the movie is about catching animals in Africa for zoo delivery - well where do you think the zoos get all those lovely animals? Do you think they just waltz into their cages with engraved invitations? Heck no, they don't. This movie retains it's classic appeal as an adventure and a bit of a love story thrown in as well. But let's face it - you can't impose today's politically correct environment on a classic old movie. It just doesn't work. For the time period when this movie was created - all the characters are true to form. The men are alpha males doing a tough seasonal job in Africa, but they also have tender and funny sides to their characters. The women are fiesty, smart, and well drawn. (The ladies are NOT jiggle and giggle girls). This movie has adventure, humor, great scenery, good action, and offers a glimpse into a different kind of world - a time when animals roamed in huge herds in Africa. Highly recommended movie for the person who loves classic older movies, and can appreciate the movie for what it is without imposing modern views onto the story or characters. I love this movie, and I have no trouble watching it over again. Very enjoyable.
B0000636UN|5.0|I have to agree that Sheryl Crow gets better with age (as most women do). This is one of her best CD's to date with lots of variety and class.  Her sultry, sexy voice is at its peak in every song.  My favorites are \\"Steve McQueen\\" and the title track, \\"C'mon, C'mon\\"---love the lyrics!  If you enjoyed Sheryl's other CD's, you won't be disappointed with this one.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Alright, this is the ONLY RAP I listen to... I can't stand anything else. For some reason though when I heard bits and pieces of Stan I wanted to hear the whole song. So I did some research to find out who the artest was, and what CD it belonged to. I had heard nothing of Eminem, so I went out and bought the Marshall Mathers LP. I sat there with my headphones on, and listened to the whole CD. There is just something about Eminem that draws you to his music, there's a lot of emotion there. This CD is great, and it has the honor of being the ONLY RAP record that sits in my metal collection. Don't listen to the news of Eminem, just be smart when listening to his music. Do just that listen. He's got talent, and is well worth the money spent of the CD. His lyrics are very well written, (Unlike this review), and the beats go great with his songs. So even if you're like me and can't stand rap give Eminem a chance, perhaps he'll grow on you too.
B0000666DW|5.0|this is amazing, simply put. it's an immense outpouring of emotion with some of the sickest guitar parts i've heard in awhile, as well as some calm, melodic parts. this is heavy rock at its finest. buy it.
6304708521|3.0|First of all, I'd like to say, if it's The Beatles, how bad can it be? I mean, honestly, even when they hit their personal rock-bottom, they were still at the top! And Magical Mystery Tour proves this. The only Beatles product to be overall unsuccessful, it still thrills me every time!<BR>Magical Mystery Tour was the first 100% Beatles movie. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help!\\" were basically set up for them by all the official people, the camera crew, Brian Epstein, Richard Lester, etcetera. They were (as Paul McCartney said about \\"Help!\\") \\"almost extras in our own movie.\\" But with Magical Mystery Tour, we learn what The Beatles can do, not what Brian Epstein can do for them.<BR>The best scenes are (obviously) the music segments. The movie's high point is \\"I am the Walrus.\\" AWESOME song. The horrible let-down about that scene is that during that trippy fade-out, instead of lots of colors and weird pictures, all that is shown is the bus moving along ever so s-l-o-w-l-y with a bunch of guys dressed in white walking behind it, plodding along extremely slowly. BORING!!! I expected cool, psychedelic pictures, but all we get at the end of \\"I am the Walrus\\" is a bus that seems to be out of gas and have a flat tire.<BR>The other scenes are cool, except for the spaghetti dream, with John shoveling piles and piles of red, slimy spaghetti onto Aunt Jessie's plate. Ugh. DISGUSTING! <BR>The rest is cool, but quite silly. Overall, I really enjoyed it. Don't hesitate to buy!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I just bought the DVD yesterday after renting it the other day and found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.  I haven't read the books (though that ought to change soon now that I'm a new father!) and I didn't see the film in theaters.  But I was captivated from the start by the story, the charactors, and the wonderful sets.  It's interesting to note that the CGI is toned down a bit compared to the eye candy that's being passed off as movies these days.  Most of the animals (including the owls) are real, as are most of the sets (real stone floors, tables, etc.), thereby making the story much more believable than Star Wars II.<br />From such young actors, the acting is superb, and the adults do a good job as well (some of those british accents seem a bit forced, though).  Some (adult)reviewers have noted that some scenes (the chess scene, for example) failed to instill fear in thier minds.  I think that they were executed perfectly, keep in mind that this movie is aimed at pre-teens.  If you'd like to see children getting their heads blown off, then you won't enjoy this film.  All in all, I was pleasantly surprised at this refreshing fantasy that's should be in anyone's collection.<br />A last note:  I give the movie 5 stars, but the DVD does lack some of the features you might expect from such a film.  The interface is cumbersome (for an adult, anyway), and the interviews are limited.  I would have enjoyed seeing more on how the film was made.
B00001OH7P|5.0|I started listening to ZIGGY when I was around 9 years old. My older sisters enjoyed this album as they listened to it along with many others but I began to get obsessed with it. To this day it is my favorite album of all time.  I can listen to it anytime, anywhere and as many times as I can until someone less aware of the unbelievable, overwhelming genius that is this album, starts to complain.  Every cut invoking its own emotional wave, its own mental graphic so well that it leaves a permanent  mark on your mind &amp; soul.  Does this sound a bit too much?  Not to me it doesn't. From the powerful beginning of FIVE YEARS to the awesome, inspiring legend of ROCK 'N' ROLL SUICIDE,&quot; this is Bowie at his best.  It is pure, unadulterated Bowie. His voice reverberating in the air and in your gut. Every nuance, every subtle detail isolated and unique and yet still part of a musical rollercoaster that blends and stands out then blends in again to itself. Melodious but never melodramatic, Bowie takes us wherever he wants us to go and we are willing and eager. If you don't fall in love with him during &quot;Soul Love&quot; then you'll never really get &quot;it.&quot;  If &quot;Sufragette City&quot; doesn't get you up on your feet or at least tapping and gesturing along with it, acting it out because you can't help it, not because you are a frustrated performer, then you might want to check your pulse and make sure you still have one. And if there is anything ever recorded that exemplifies &quot;cool&quot; better than &quot;Rock 'n' Roll Suicide&quot; then I'm turning in my leather and shades right now.  Hands down, this is the ultimate Bowie album. I enjoy, own and listen endlessly to many Bowie pieces not on this album, but if I had to pick one collection of Bowie songs to have with me on a deserted island, this would have to be the one.  Of course I'd mourn &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot; until the day of my rescue.
0783226063|4.0|Well... I'm not really sure what I think yet.  Whoever did the costumes and scenery was really brilliant.  That was almost exactly the way I pictured the Dune universe.  I also loved Patrick Stuart as Gurney Halleck.  However, some of the deviations from the book were pointless and unnecessary.  The Atreides &quot;weirding modules&quot; didn't need to be there, and there was absolutely no point in making the Guild navigators some kind of blobby octopus thingys.  Overall, quite good, but the book is still far superior.
0440219078|3.0|The book is about a boy who lives in a communtiy. He gets selected to be the new receiver of the community. He gets the memories of the whole past from a person who saved them for his whole life in his BIG brain. By getting this memories ( f.e. of snow or love ) he forms himself a opinion about the community and the rules. He wants to leave the community to give the memories back to the inhabitants...
B0000667ES|3.0|I wanted to do my make-up like famous african american women, but although Kevin SHOWS in pictures how to thin down the nose, lighten out the skin tone, and other artful concealments,  he never mentions these steps in the written descriptions. All the descriptions seem to generally be the same steps, page after page. He is phenomenal in his transformations, but does a poor job explaining EXACTLY how to do them ourselves. The pictures are beautiful, though.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As a deaf person...I have to wait usually until the most current movies are brought out on DVD format. While everyone else was going to the movie, I had to wait another nine months in order to enjoy it. Movies such as Spider-Man can be somewhat enjoyable if you cannot hear the sound or speech, but for something like Harry Potter, where the writing and the interaction between all the characters in the book are so key to understanding, those of us with no hearing need to wait until someone bothers to caption them.<br />Sometimes I am disappointed because the build-up by the media and word-of-mouth is such that I expect more from the movie than it is able to provide. That wasn't the case with this movie/DVD. As someone who remembers going to the library and reading every possible book I could get on mythology, the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Anderson, many science fiction books written for children, and all books written on Merlin and the Arthurian legend, I was pleased when this generation had a book come out involving fantasy and fairy tale, that could withstand the test of time. The movie did a spectacular job of following the high precedent set by the book. Rowling was right to keep such strong control over her books so that they would be faithful to what she wrote.<br />The movie is spectacular in special effects and in casting not only Harry, but his cohorts. Radcliffe is a read find and his humility in playing this part makes for one of the least obnoxious child actors I've ever seen. You can tell the kids had great fun making this movie in spite of the work. It's nice to see so many great British actors and actressess participating in this endeavor to bring the book to life. Thank heavens, Richard Harris' granddaughter threatened him if he didn't take the part of the headmaster of the school. And as a deaf person who relies upon facial expression, I waited with impatience for Rickman to show up and pull his usual glowering looks...he didn't disappoint.<br />This is not a movie for small children. My grandchildren couldn't sit still that long. They come and go while watching this, but the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband didn't get some of it because he didn't read the book. There is a bit missing if you don't read the book first...but people probably said the same thing about The Wizard of Oz.<br />...
0767849493|2.0|The skewering of organized religions is<BR>always welcome but a film with this much<BR>dialogue needs to have greater depth to<BR>be compelling.  The writing is occasionally<BR>well done but that is not enough to save the <BR>movie from tedium.
0738206679|4.0|I really enjoyed this eminently readable book.  I consumed it in one sitting last night.  Not only is it intellectually stimulating, &quot;Linked&quot; has proved to be quite practical.  My business involves the facilitation of entrepreneurial networks.  Laszlo Barabasi's erudite explanation of scale-free networks helped me better understand a mis-match between the structure of the network we serve and the structuring and pricing of our services.  The former won't change, so we're working hard to figure out how to better adapt the latter.
0780021150|3.0|This movie sounds VERY intriguing to me and I will probably purchase it... however, in fairness to the complaints about the Criterion transfer specifically, the lines at the top of the frame, I sent an email to Jon Mulvaney (who responds nearly immediately to ANY questions you have about Criterion releases) and I quote his reply:<BR>&quot;The line that you are referring to was caused by the optical printer during the creation of the original film elements of M.  Most video versions have cropped out the line, therefore deleting almost 25% of the picture. We choose not to, making our decision in consultation with the restoration group who did the work from original film elements in Germany.  We've tried to correct the problem as much as possible, but no matter what, it can be distracting.  Even Fritz Lang knew about this.&quot;<br />As you would expect from them, Criterion did the best they could do (as ALWAYS!).
B00006690F|5.0|EMINEM DOES IT AGAIN!!! He has once again proved his position as one of the greatest rappers of all time. This time his lyrics are more deep and goes in a different direction. As with all his albums, you walk away thinking about your life. Not as funny this time but just as hypnotizing. He talks about his life up to now from his last album, his daughter, his wife, his lawsuits and everything in between. This album is proof how a rapper can grow into a completely different direction and still be able to shift all his audience along with him into that direction, that is truly talent!!!! To those who thought Eminem was just about rapping about drugs, or talking smack about other people, get this album cuz it will convice you that his truly is one of the greatest lyricist and modern artist of all time!!! Most artist now only rely on how much sex appeal they have (you know they little pops)and no talent, and if you're as sick of that as me, get this CD, you will not be disappointed at all the talent presented, now if only all artists had as much talent as he does, would it be the end of all the little pop wonders??? GEt this CD, he is one of the greatest rappers of all time!!!!
B000062TU1|3.0|I had high hopes for this DVD. But alas, it is lacking in most of what I expect from a good DVD version of a movie. The extra scenes require the viewer to solve a complicated \\"puzzle\\" in order to see them. There's no director commentary available, and very little in the way of those \\"extras\\" (info on special effects, for instance) that make DVDs a must. The DVD-ROM portion won't operate properly on my 2-year-old computer. In short, this DVD is pretty much a rip-off. And to top it all off, you have to buy a separate DVD to get the widescreen version. The only thing good about this DVD is that you get to see the movie on your TV set--and amazingly, it's better than in the theater. I felt a little overwhelmed by the theatrical version, but seeing it this way is just right.
B00003CXI1|3.0|While I liked the film, I thought it could have been made better.  As a matter of fact, I was glad it did not stray at all from the book except with Quirrell dying like that . . .? That was kind of stupid.  First off, the movie was too long for the length of the book.  152 minutes is quite long for a 90,000 word novel.  Secondly they tried too many scenes in, then they widdled it down too short.  Now I understand.  With a book like Harry Potter, there is so much that you want to see made into a movie, but cutting them down so small took a lot of magic from the movie.  Before Academy Awards night, I never saw the movie, but I thought, going only by what other people said that it deserved all of the nominations even if it did not deserve winning anything.  Now since I have seen it, I would say it got more than it deserved and Harry Potter fans should be pleased.  It deserved nominations for costumes, special effects and music score.  No more, no less.  And yes, I probably would have given the movie an extra star if I never read the book, but I have so I am more informed to make decisions about it.
0792163710|5.0|I first watched Shane 20 years ago and marveled at the attention to detail and character development. As the movie opens , you are immediately captivated by the Starretts and the mysterious Shane and equally repulsed by the Ryker brothers and their hired henchmen.  The supporting cast is in my opinion perfectly cast and their direction is flawless. That this movie had six Academy Awards nominations and only won one in the category of Best Color Photography still amazes me.  If you had to choose the best Western ever made, this is the one.<BR>       My only complaint on the DVD is the removal of little Joey's last spoken words in the movie &quot; Bye Shane !&quot; as Shane rides out of the valley.
B000001EC1|5.0|Bon Jovi-Crossroads. This album is really fantastic there are many top tunes on this cd. Even if you are not into the likes of Bon Jovi, you,yes even you mad peole out there would even adore this. I believe that 'always' is one of the best songs ever made. Go on rush out to buy it now you don't know what your missing!!
B000002IWQ|4.0|Counterparts is a decent Rush album but not one of my favorites, I'd rather play Moving Pictures, Permanent Waves or Roll the Bones. But what erks me are the obtuse, intolerant so-called fans that wreak of homophobia. Criticizing Peart's lyrics to \\"Nobody's Hero\\" as being too alienating and devoid of reality is pure bull. I'm sure those particular lyrics are alienating to the rednecks, aryan brothers, klan members and other[s]that claim to be Rush fans. I thought you were into Rush because they pushed the limits of music and what it can do for the ears, mind and heart. If not, then forget about the underlying themes of 2112 and any other document about the fight against oppression.

B00005NWRS|5.0|Warning: This is going to be a tediously glowing review.<br />There's no real innovative way to say this, but Ryan Adam's \\"Gold\\" is quite simply a stunning album. Strong lyrics paired with classic songwriting and a production style perfectly tailored to Ryan's voice and guitar all makes for an album that is overwhelmingly good from start to finish. Other reviewers have complained of occasional mediocrity; I just don't see it.<br />The lyrics are great, sometimes even better than great, because they are equal parts clever and suggestive. The subtlety of \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\"'s opening lines just kills me: \\"They slapped them on you where that bracelet used to be...\\" The word \\"handcuffs\\" is never pronounced, but the manner in which the gift of a bracelet has given way to the rift expressed in the arrest is just beautiful, managing to start the song off on an emotional bender that doesn't need to belabor its own sadness.<br />What I like best about \\"Gold\\" as an album, though, is that it really works AS AN ALBUM, a real rare thing these days. From the exuberant crescendo of the first track, \\"New York, New York\\" (which hits me with something extra in the wake of September 11th, and in a way that I really can't explain) to the west-coast closing-time elegy in the last track, \\"Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd.,\\" I can't help but feel that Ryan has managed to capture all of America in 16 tracks, from the East Village to the City of Angels. And the sensitive production of Ethan Johns, who ensures that almost every song is recorded in a different key and with constantly varying instrumentation (although within Ryan's normal \\"new country\\" comfort zone), means that your ears never get tired, because every track is something musically different.<br />You've got the great ballads, you've got the harder blues (\\"Tina Toledo\\"), you've got a touch of gospel (\\"Rescue Blues\\"), you've got building rambles that Jeff Buckley could have written (\\"Nobody Girl\\"), you've got the anger of \\"EnemyFire\\" and the world's best ode to complex women in \\"Sylvia Plath.\\" Mostly, though, you've just got something made out of gold. I must have listened to this album over a hundred times already, and I'm still not able to go more than a couple of days without hearing it.<br />As for the extra five tracks, I wish I could say that they're superfluous in the way that only B-side, limited-edition extra tracks can be, but they're actually pretty good. \\"Rosalie Come and Go\\" is a sly rocker in the mold of \\"Answering Bell,\\" \\"The Fools We Are As Men\\" is a little more thoughtful and deliberate, and \\"Sweet Black Magic\\" is a bluegrassy prayer to score by. \\"The Bar Is A Beautiful Place\\" was probably written next to \\"Hollywood Blvd.\\" on a napkin at Boardners, and \\"Cannonball Days\\" is pure, double-time-strummed acoustic adrenaline. If you love \\"Gold,\\" you'll really like these additional tracks. Whether you should shell out for them probably depends on just how much you love \\"Gold.\\" But I like them a lot.

B000060MY6|5.0|Okay, David Lynch is a brilliant director. I don't love everything he has done, but when he does do a good movie, like Mullholand Drive, it is quite a wonderful thing. &quot;Mullholand Drive&quot; is a very beautiful and musical film. My appreciation is of the gestalt of the picture, characters and plot lines are vague and get blurred. &quot;Mullholand Drive&quot; really becomes an impressionistic work of emotion and imagery, with a crescendo of editing at the end that takes the senses elegantly from the bowels of fear out into a sad and mysterious light. The film has other important nuances, dealing with Lynch's on going obsessions, the music and styles of his youth (Roy Orbison's &quot;Crying&quot; sung in Spanish, the swing dancing that opens the film), mystical and odd characters (the cowboy, the burned man behind the wall), and seductive women. It is also a film about acting, and about how actors control our emotions and our sense, and how easily we fall under the spell of their illusional reality. For example, I would like to bring your attention to the uncomfortable casting scene where the young woman must share an intimate moment with the older man with orange skin. As they get into character, the camera completely looses the context of the scene, and for a moment we a transported into watching a different movie. This happens at other points during the film, but that scene immediately leapt to mind. <BR>Excellent film, the only good film this year (Although I have not gotten to seen &quot;Little Otik&quot; yet). Highly recommended.
0446608955|4.0|Happy, sad, thrilling, and heartfelt are the words that come to mind after reading Nicholas Sparks novel \\"A Walk to Remember\\". A book that goes back to 1958 in Beaufort, North Carolina, the story is of how Landon Carter, the popular class president of Beaufort High, and Jaime Sullivan, the shy daughter of the towns Baptist Minister fall in love. Now at first Landon and Jamie hadn't even spoke to one another. When they were younger, Landon and his best buddies would hide behind bushes, and yell obscene names at Hegbert Sullivan, Jamie's father. But one class together could change everything between Landon and Jamie. Now Jamie  the real innocent type, always getting good grades, and helping out at the orphanage as much as she could. Landon and Jaimie got to play the lead roles in the school play about an angel that Hegbert had written, but not by Landon's choice. His teacher nearly begged him to play the role because she had no one else to do it. But that was the spark that lit the flame between Jamie and Landon. They  became very close after having spent time together so they could rehearse for the<BR>play. After about four months had gone by, Jamie finally confronts Landon and tells him that she was diagnosed with Leukemia about seven months ago. He was devastated and was upset that Jamie hadn't told him sooner. As time went by, Jamie got sicker and sicker. Then Landon  finally realized how much he loved Jamie and asked her to marry him and she said \\"yes\\", as odd as that seems for only being seventeen. But, they were in<BR>love. Jamie's father, the town's Baptist minister,  performed the ceremony, of course.  The book leaves you hanging. Did Jamie really die or not? It's all up to you to decide. But the heartfelt, riveting novel is one I would recommend to anyone.
B000002U8G|3.0|This album could also of been called \\"Muddle\\", or \\"The Best And The Worst Of Pink Floyd\\".<br />This becomes apparent after one listen, the first and sixth tracks on \\"Meddle\\" are superb; the other four aren't.<br />The album opens with \\"One Of These Days\\" with whistling wind and then both, Gilmour and Waters, break in on. Lovely vibrant bass lines. The double bass carries on through out the song giving it a very heavy feel. The only words spoken are \\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\".<br />The song was dedicated to Jimmy Young, the British Radio D.J., who the band had been having a running battle of words with for several years. The song reaches a dramatic climax with Gilmour laying down some of the greatest slide guitar work he was ever to put down in the studio, skipping straight onto the sixth song on the album, \\"Echoes\\". Originally it had taken up the whole of side two of the vinyl \\"Meddle\\" released in 1971, clocking in at twenty three minutes and thirty seconds. From the opening submarine type radar echoes you know that the Floyd have combined to give us a real classic. Each musician excels in his own department, Nick Mason changes the role that percussions would be seen in from here on out in rock music. The drums are not just used as a way of keeping time with the song, but actually as a lead instrument. To this end Mason comes out of this song with great Kudos (if you get the chance to see the movie \\"Pink Floyd Live At Pompey\\" you can see what a devastating effort Mason had both sonically and visually on this song). \\"One Of These Days\\" is the oldest song to remain in the Pink Floyd live set list right up to their last tour.<br />Roger Waters laid down a solid bottom end to the song, never letting the weirdness get totally out of control. Rick Wright's keyboards caught him at a creative peak and his psychedelic solo in the middle has often been copied but never bettered.<br />The vocals were handled by duets between Gilmour and Wright which suit the song wonderfully, although lyrically it's just gobbledygook. However, it's the guitar playing of a young David Gilmour that really catches your attention as he rings every ounce of emotion from his six strings, reaching higher and higher as each passing section of the song progresses, at the same time both violent and controlled. \\"Echoes\\" was to remain in Pink Floyd live set for many a year before \\"The Wall\\" took over the whole show. It was even dusted down and brought out for the commencement of \\"The Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" tour (the first Pink Floyd Tour without Roger Waters) before it had to make way for newer material.<br />Compared to these two wonderful pieces of music the other four songs on the album are horrible. Of the two worst offenders is \\"Fearless\\", which, after meandering listlessly for seven minutes, finishes with \\"The Kop\\". At Anfield, the headquarters of Liverpool football club, singing \\"You'll never walk alone\\" and then chanting \\"Liverpool\\" is all very well if you're a scouser of the red persuasion, but a bit of a bore to the rest of the world. Worse is to follow with \\"Seamus\\". Nearly three minutes of nonsense with David Gilmour stumbling along on acoustic guitar, mumbling some lyrics, whilst Steve Marriot's dog howls and yelps over the top of it. Truly embarrassing to listen to. It's what you might imagine Manuel from Fawlty Towers to come up with if you left him in a recording studio.<br />So my advice would be to get hold of a copy of \\"Meddle\\", cue your C.D player to programme tracks 1 and 6, and forget the rest...ht which suit the song wonderfully, although lyrically it's just gobbledygook.

The subtlety of \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\"'s opening lines just kills me: \\"They slapped them on you where that bracelet used to be...\\"  The word \\"handcuffs\\" is never pronounced, but the manner in which the gift of a bracelet has given way to the rift expressed in the arrest is just beautiful, managing to start the song off on an emotional bender that doesn't need to belabor its own sadness.<br />What I like best about \\"Gold\\" as an album, though, is that it really works AS AN ALBUM, a real rare thing these days.  From the exuberant crescendo of the first track, \\"New York, New York\\" (which hits me with something extra in the wake of September 11th, and in a way that I really can't explain) to the west-coast closing-time elegy in the last track, \\"Goodnight, Hollywood Blvd.,\\" I can't help but feel that Ryan has managed to capture all of America in 16 tracks, from the East Village to the City of Angels.  And the sensitive production of Ethan Johns, who ensures that almost every song is recorded in a different key and with constantly varying instrumentation (although within Ryan's normal \\"new country\\" comfort zone), means that your ears never get tired, because every track is something musically different.<br />You've got the great ballads, you've got the harder blues (\\"Tina Toledo\\"), you've got a touch of gospel (\\"Rescue Blues\\"), you've got building rambles that Jeff Buckley could have written (\\"Nobody Girl\\"), you've got the anger of \\"Enemy Fire\\" and the world's best ode to complex women in \\"Sylvia Plath.\\"  Mostly, though, you've just got something made out of gold.  I must have listened to this album over a hundred times already, and I'm still not able to go more than a couple of days without hearing it.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I saw Cats for the first time on the afternoon of Wednesday July 4, 1984 at the Wintergarden Theater in my homeland of New York.  Since then the music and performance has been ringing in my head.  I've seen it at least twice again since moving to the DC area at the National Theater.  Then this performance on Great Performances on PBS, and I bought the DVD soon after that.  It will not take you long to see why and how it won 7 1982 Tony Awards including Best Musical and why it kept up for 20 years both here and in London.  Somewhere someone is still performing it.  This performance beings two of the best of both original casts together: Elaine Paige (the Original London Grizabella) and Ken Page (no relation) (the Original Broadway Deuteronomy) with a talented group of others and veteran theater actor John Mills as veteran theater cat Gus.  This purposely staged for tv showing is lacking the poem/song of Growltiger's Last Stand, only because the actor who plays Gus has to play Growltiger and Sir John is over 80.  But even without that one number, this is still a performance worth owning in your DVD library.  If an actual live stage performance comes out on DVD or even a movie hits the big screen then DVD, by all means by it.  Until then, this is the only way to bring T.S. Elliot's performed poems into your house.  So buy it and let the memory live again.
0446608955|4.0|Happy, sad, thrilling, and heartfelt are the words that come to mind after reading Nicholas Sparks novel \\"A Walk to Remember\\". A book that goes back to 1958 in Beaufort, North Carolina, the story is of how Landon Carter, the popular class president of Beaufort High, and Jaime Sullivan, the shy daughter of the towns Baptist Minister fall in love. Now at first Landon and Jamie hadn't even spoke to one another. When they were younger, Landon and his best buddies would hide behind bushes, and yell obscene names at Hegbert Sullivan, Jamie's father. But one class together could change everything between Landon and Jamie. Now Jamie  the real innocent type, always getting good grades, and helping out at the orphanage as much as she could. Landon and Jaimie got to play the lead roles in the school play about an angel that Hegbert had written, but not by Landon's choice. His teacher nearly begged him to play the role because she had no one else to do it. But that was the spark that lit the flame between Jamie and Landon. They  became very close after having spent time together so they could rehearse for the<BR>play. After about four months had gone by, Jamie finally confronts Landon and tells him that she was diagnosed with Leukemia about seven months ago. He was devastated and was upset that Jamie hadn't told him sooner. As time went by, Jamie got sicker and sicker. Then Landon  finally realized how much he loved Jamie and asked her to marry him and she said \\"yes\\", as odd as that seems for only being seventeen. But, they were in<BR>love. Jamie's father, the town's Baptist minister,  performed the ceremony, of course.  The book leaves you hanging. Did Jamie really die or not? It's all up to you to decide. But the heartfelt, riveting novel is one I would recommend to anyone.
0793518326|4.0|Let Me first Stress That I am Not just a Beatlemaniac but I also Played John In the Off/Broadway production of Beatlemania. I thought The Book needed work. It was written years ago and with the technology we have today, we can do better. Ok.... Let's get started !!! There were alot of mistakes !!! Especially in the repetitons ( This is when a verse or versus repeat ). Notes are misplaced, guitar chord positions are sometimes incorrect as are the notes for some of the solos. Words are mispelled. Sometimes guitar chords are missing all-together and last but not least There are songs missing. When I hear the word 'Complete ' It should entail Everything. A good example of this is ' Cry For A Shadow ' or ' I'll Be On My Way ' Cry For A Shadow is, by the way, the first Beatles original to Ever grace a record. If you are looking for any of the Beatles Early original material - You Will Not find it in this book. There are many others as well. Such as : Hello Little Girl, You'll Be Mine, In Spite of All The Danger, Like Dreamers Do, If You've Got Trouble, That Means Alot, Not guilty As well as Cover songs They did (Example ' Aint she Sweet', ' My Bonnie ', ' Some Other Guy ', ' Soldier of Love ', 'Besame Mucho', Hippy Hippy Shake ' and ' You'd Better Leave My Kitten Alone ' ) and Songs Written for other Artists such as Bily J. Kramer, Peter and Gordon, Mary Hopkins and Badfinger. Remember the Song Which was written for The Beatles Called : 'How Do You Do It ' which was recorded by them but never released and then given to Jerry and The Pacemakers because The Beatles didn't like it and opted for 'Please Please Me ' refurbished. Sorry, but the word Complete means Complete. I haven't really bitched about it because I know all of these songs inside/out. I'm mentioning it to those individuals who are searching for these songs, some of which do not exist on paper yet. I Think with the technology we have today, We can make the proper corrections and include the lost songs to make it Complete. One more thing I'd really like to add is the size of the book, although it is legible ( sometimes with the help of a magnifying glass ) it really should be in a larger format such as an 11 by 17 inch book. I'd gladly pay the extra money for it. There is simply way to much information to squeeze into a book this size which may have added to the amount of typos. With all this said I think It's not bad. However, it is not complete or completely accurate by a long shot !!! I do recommend it to anyone interested in playing The Beatles Music. This is about as close as you will get at this point in time to one book with this much info in it until They come out with a second and obviously much larger addition with all the songs in it. I really hope and think they will do this very Soon.
B00005JKCF|5.0|\\"Spiderman\\" (2002)<br />This year's summer blockbusters are actually looking pretty ship-shape! Last year we had the disappointments of such films as Rush Hour 2, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and so on and so forth, but to make up for those, in 2002 we've got Spiderman, Star Wars: Episode II and heaps of other intriguing films being released. Not only do I think this will be one of the best summer blockbusters of this year, I think it could turn out to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002.<br />I did expect quite a lot from this movie, but it surpassed my expectations beyond my wildest dreams. This movie is such a hard one in which to find fault! I was going to give it a slightly lower grade but then I just couldn't think of any reason not to give it the one I gave it (scroll down). Sure, the movie is cheesy in some places, but duh; it's a comic book adaptation! Of course there's going to be a bit of cheese n' corn. I must be the only person who liked the Green Goblin as a villain. To me he was perfectly menacing and his timing was right-on. I thought the costume would look horrible but it was actually OK.<br />This movie keeps you in suspense (especially during the fair sequence) and surprised me with its genuine wit and heart. There is also one particular little part that made me completely jump out of my seat (watch out for when Willem Dafoe wakes up after being gassed!). The movie brings across some very important messages that not only superheroes should learn. I also liked it the way the movie built up Peter Parker becoming Spiderman because it put a bit of bulk on his character.<br />The acting in Spiderman was terrific. In my opinion, all the actors were perfectly cast. Tobey Maguire is not the sort of guy you'd expect to play a superhero but he pulls it off stunningly, making a great hero and also turning Peter Parker into a likeable and memorable teen. Willem Dafoe reminded me a lot of Jack Nicholson with his Green Goblin part. He has a great, evil laugh and his character (when he's not the Goblin) is sort of like a schizophrenic. The scenes where Dafoe is \\"talking to himself\\" are terrific and very well acted. I thought they would make me laugh but they were actually pretty creepy. Kirsten Dunst is great as Mary Jane, providing her with a heart and personality. Dunst has exactly the right look for the movie, and has some fantastic chemistry with Maguire. I also adored Rosemary Harris in her role as Peter Parker's auntie.<br />The special effects in this movie are terrific. I can't really pick out any key scenes where they were brilliant because I just completely forgot I was watching special effects. They are very realistic. The sound techniques are used effectively, especially in the last 20 minutes or so. <br />One thing I would've liked is for Spiderman to maybe use some more gadgets? We pretty much got the sticky web thing and that was it. Maybe he just has that, I don't know, I've never read the comics (although I sort of want to after seeing this terrific movie). I look forward to seeing how Spidey's super-powers are improved in the next movie. <br />Spiderman is a movie I think everyone will enjoy. It has a big heart and it is always entertaining to watch. It has terrific morals and messages and is able to mix genuine wit and comedy into an action-packed and intriguing storyline. This movie was a lot of fun and I think it'll be one of the biggest grossing movies of 2002, if not, the biggest! Bring it on, Spiderman 2!<br />MY GRADE: A
0792843584|5.0|Most folks say this is overblown and not to good.<BR>Some people think this is all show and no go.<BR>They are wrong. This is a solid western epic.<BR>Great action.
B00000J7JH|5.0|Waits' jazzy sound often betrays his real influence on popular music. Some of the guest stars on this album are not jazz musicians in the slightest, like Primus frontman Les Claypool for example. The diverse guest list on MULE VARIATIONS is just as well, seeing as how MULE VARIATIONS is one of Waits' most varied efforts. <BR>Those who remember ZZ Top before the ELIMINATOR-era will see their influence on Waits' music with such songs as &quot;Big In Japan&quot;, &quot;Cold Water&quot; &amp; &quot;Filipino Box Spring Hog&quot;. Instead of the focus being on piano like Waits' earliest songs, it's placed on guitar, which helps the songs rock, instead of just swing. <BR>This album may be Waits' chance to rock out, but his old songs of sadness &amp; heartbreak are still evident on somber ballads like &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot;, &quot;Picture In A Frame&quot; &amp; &quot;Georgia Lee&quot;. The music on these songs is so faint, you're practically jolted out of your seat as soon as Waits' gravel-voiced self arrives on the scene. <BR>A few songs have Waits experimenting with a sort of tribal rhythm that would not have been out of place on Paul Simon's GRACELAND album. &quot;Lowside Of The Road&quot;, &quot;Eyeball Kid&quot; &amp; &quot;Chocolate Jesus&quot; all have drums so high in the mix, you're just waiting for some natives to come dancing out of your stereo. <BR>No singles were released from this album I don't think, but the best candidate would have been the heartfelt ballad &quot;Hold On&quot;. At first listen, I thought this was an outtake from Bruce Springsteen's NEBRASKA album. Springsteen fans, however, might enjoy this rare chance to see Waits in an almost clear-voiced croon. <BR>I've always been a critic of why some artists take an eternity to record a new album. Some people say it's a matter of getting the music on tape the way they like it, or that their inspiration occasionally runs dry for long periods of time. But unlike such famous perfectionists like Paul Simon, Stevie Wonder &amp; Tom Scholz (Boston), Tom Waits doesn't keep his fans waiting for something new while trying to make things sound absolutely perfect. Acting may be Waits' forte nowadays, but MULE VARIATIONS is proof that whenever Waits does get into the groove of making music again, he doesn't disappoint his fans &amp; is well worth the wait.
0671027344|5.0|I loved this book; some people might not feel comfortable reading about controversial issues such as teen-age sexuality, memories, drug experimentation, thoughts, irritations, frustration, however I thought it was an awesome book. I'm not a freshman but I related so much to the book. I like the fact that all the events in the novel were realistically and more profoundly explored through the eyes of a teen-ager named Charlie. He is extremely intelligent, and was always there for his friends, but I do agree that he put everybody's lives ahead of his and thought that \\"it counted as love\\" He just had to do thing when he felt like it, not think about others, and just do it for himself. Even thought we don't know what happens after other than he is getting ready for his sophomore year I liked how he ended the novel. He says goodbye in a very simple way, I kind of felt part of him, because I had \\"listen and understand\\" to all his experiences like he wanted me when I stared reading the book. He has just lived such similar experienced like I have. It's an excellent book. I'm pleased that I read this amazing book, because I got to notice that I'm not alone in all the things that go on in my life and growing up.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley was one of the most romantic singers of his time. Each song woos you with candy and flowers in a way only Jeff Buckley could. &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; is one of my favorite songs of all time. If only all last goodbyes could be so sweet and true. Buckley tells the person he loves &quot;I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye&quot;. Also &quot;Lover You Should Have Come Over&quot; is exceptionally written and perfectly sung. His rendition of Hallelujah is beautiful. Jeff Buckley's voice will be greatly missed in the world of music that actually meant something.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is in the top three westerns of all time, right after<BR>\\"The Good,The Bad and the Ugly\\" and \\"The Wild Bunch\\".<BR>John Wayne classic and the action is amazing. The DVD<BR>really allows this classic western to shine.
B000065U1N|3.0|One of the finest chicken rice the Sticky has ever tasted has got to be at the small restaurant on River Valley Rd, Singapore. The chicken itself is tender and juicy, cooled to perfection, and sits on a layer of fresh tomato and cucumber slices. The soya-oil braising is subtle, not overdone, and zesty to the point of making me break down and cry. The rice is rich with chicken stock flavours, and nicely gareng. The broth is a sublime touch, cutting finely through the richness of the entire dish. The ginger and chilli mixture makes me weep...<br />This is one of Josh Hartnett's favourite dishes, and proved to be the motivating force for his performance in Black Hawk Down. He fought bravely, knowing all the while that back home a perfect chicken rice would be his. Now that's dedication to rice!
6302891272|4.0|Although the case may say its Kurosawa's version of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth', it is a very loose adaption.  'Throne of Blood' was more or less inspiried by 'Macbeth', but the story is very different.  I'm willing to bet the same is true for 'Ran', which is an adaption of 'King Lear'(which I have not read).  Nonetheless, the story is pure Kurosawa as dividing clans fight for territorial disputes and castles.  A female character here is very similar to Lady Macbeth and many scenes do come right out of the play.  She pushes her husband to do evil thing before the evil is done to him.  If one is expecting to find Shakespere here, do not rent or buy it.  The film does not have the unbelievably awesome monologue given by Macbeth at the end of the play.  But if one is wanting to find a gem from Kurosawa's early years, this is bound to satisfy.  As always in all of his movies, at least one unforgettable sequence exists.  In this one, it comes at the end.  You will know it when you see it.
B00004TRD8|5.0|Terminator 2 is off the hook! The movie does a great job of picking up where it left off in the original. T2 is the perfect enemy for John Connor and the Terminator. He's faster and smarter but has his weaknesses as well. Edward Furlong does a great job as John, and Linda Hamilton plays Sara wonderfully. She is exactly the way you would have pictured a woman who was told in the past that her future child would save the world. This movie is filled with action and great special fx. This is a must see.
0792840852|5.0|This movie brings back the golden age of musicals. A comedic look at the 1920's cross from silent movies to talking pictures. The songs are awesome. Hearing Gene (Don Lockwood) sing that &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; song would just melt your heart! The song &quot;Make 'em Laugh&quot; (that wasn't even supposed to be in the movie!) is wonderful! If you don't remember anything about the movie (which who could forget any of it?) you always remember Donald O'Conner going through that wall. Debbie Reynolds is not a dancer, but you couldn't tell in this movie. They're voices were strong and beautiful together. Even when they're not together. &quot;Fit as a Fiddle&quot; is a great song, makes me wish I knew how to tap. Gene Kelly fans, Debbie Reynolds fans and Donald O'Conner fans alike should all watch this superb movie.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Well it's been a hectic few years for those of us in the rock scene. We've had to deal with Boy Bands, Their Girl Counterparts and a whole bunch of other [stuff] that makes me cringe.<br />Luckily for us all, we have the new disc by Andrew WK. No Gimmicks, No bull. Just great rock and roll. Buy this Disc! And when it gets super huge, make sure to tell your friends that You had it First!
0140441409|5.0|_This is a truly great book, and I've read it three times now. This is inspite of the fact that the style is a bit dense for the modern reader.<br /><br />_Personally, I have always been attracted to the Stoic emphasis on inner peace and ethical living according to the example of nature and the cosmos.<br /><br />_It is not surprising that Aurelius was also a great influence on Henry David Thoreau. I understand that President Clinton cited this as his favorite book, though for the life of me I cannot concieve of him as a Stoic- Epicurian perhaps, but not Stoic....<br /><br />_I was struck by Aurelius's repeated admonition that it makes no difference whether one lives 40 years or 10,000- you will still have experienced everything, for nothing is new and everything repeats in endless cycles. He is right, once you get past 40, these repeating cycles become more and more apparent....
B00005J6UP|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I watched it all the time as a kid and now as an adult. If you havent seen or heard about the Goonies, you must have been living in a cave. This is a great childrens' adventure story about a group of kids known as the Goonies who want to save their homes and go on a treasure hunt to get the money needed. Along the way they meet up with criminals and a series of booby traps. This dvd is great because the commentary is terrific. The commentary was made very recently because Sean Astin was doing one of the Lord of the Rings movies. Its great to see what they look like now and all the little quirks that went into making the movie. Plus it features Cyndi Lauper's video &quot; Goonies are good enough&quot;. This is a terrific dvd and a terrific movie that is a must have.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is perhaps one of the most charismatic bands of all time.  They musically connect with the listener on every tune.  Their ability to effortlessly change their musical style, quality track to quality track, is a tribute to the sheer talent of this group.  Whatever style they're playing, it's at the top of its form.  If you only get one Clash CD, get this one and enjoy!  I'd also recommend Sandinista for the sheer number of quality musical gems amidst the quantity of tunes.
B000002H2H|5.0|I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such \\"[junk]\\". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since.
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie - the movie is great.  Chances are you've experianced Harry Potter in some way or another.  The video has a few flaws here and there with the transfer - but overall it's minimal.  The sound is superb.<br />As for the extras, the box describes all the many features, but fails to mention that you can only do things once you've completed others.  The dvd contains 6 extra scenes - but in order to do so - you have to play a game that is as fun as pushing blocks through a hole in the wall.  Boredom and frustration sets in from the first momment.  Pardon me for felling peeved that I have to WORK for my extras.  As for the rest of the extras - they're boring.  The wand thing is stupid and it's always the third wand.  The transfigure feature is no existant.  And the tour of hogwarts couldn't go any slower.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is genius. I'm a woman and I found this movie great! Brad Pitt and Ed Norton are wonderful, and Helena Bohnam Carter is sensational as the neurotic Marla. The fight scenes are so real I wanted to jump up and yell stop! This movie is a gem and a must see. The movie begins with Ed Norton a normal guy who just cant sleep. So, he gets intertwined in the lives of support groups during his late night hours and they help him sleep like a baby. While faking every illness that the others in the groups have he meets Marla. She even participates in a testicular cancer group. The nerve of this women, but she figures hey she doesnt have testicles, why not. Just as neurotic as he is they begin divying up the groups. But things begin to occure in Norton's life that he just cant explain after a plane ride where he meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. All the wild signs point to one man...Tyler Durden. Tyler seems to be an excentric soap manufacturer but he is so much more. Having Tyler in Norton's life helps him change for the best and for the worst. This movie is a must see!
0971855110|5.0|okay...  i have like 25 other organizing books... but this one actually ....i think is going to help.  The *organizing book* market is pretty cluttered with a re-hash of the same kind of material just re-worded and re-packaged a bit....but this book really is a new approach for me.  I think it has some solid advice on keeping up with things although... she stresses that cleaning done not perfectly...is STILL cleaning and should be appreciated.  She reminds you that you *arent behind* and to just *jump in* where ever you are... and she can relate, coming from a similar disorganized backgroud...so there isnt that feeling that you are being *scolded*. Her routines are very helpful... but really you just start slow...and build up with them... She's kind of funny too..in a self-depreciating sort of way...kind of the way the tightwad gazette is written, maybe....  Of note: there is some religious referencing in the book (ie God-Brezzes etc) but it isnt something that is pushed on you or part of the program... it is only added as part of the authors experience but if that is something that you dont want to even read about than maybe this book might not be fore you.. personally it took a while for me to get passed it...but i am really glad that i did... this book is truly a labor of love for the author and has been a real help for me so far
0375703764|5.0|I look at this book like the herb cilantro.  You'll either love it or hate it.  No one reads this and says &quot;it was OK.&quot;  <br />Amazingly put together, the _story_, if you want to call it that, is told from a perspective that I found unique and haunting.  The book is quite nerve chilling; my fiance read it and it kept her up at night wondering if the house she was in held the same mysteries.
B000002MP2|5.0|Okay, let's get one thing straight. While the Clash and the Ramones may have pioneered this genre of Punk Rock, Green Day put it on the map with this excellent album that has stood the test of time. <br />An almost forgotten art, Pop/Punk was brought back to the radio mainstream in 1994, after the grunge movement. Cobain was dead, but the alternative scene was still strong at this point. So, Green Day releases Dookie. A masterpiece that works on so many different levels: Sardonic, cynical humor, broken-hearted ravings, and a comment on modern society. They described middle class America with such precision, with such accuracy. <br />Classics like When I Come Around, Basket Case, Long View, and She are all still making their circuits on rock radio. As they should. These are songs that described an era, and let others know that Green Day are a product of everything we were.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Derek Zoolander is one of the hottest male models ever, until Hansel steps onto the scene and steals the covetted male model award away from Derek. Now Derek contemplates if there is more to life than being really ridiculously good looking. But when you are at your weakest is when people begin to take advantage of you and so it is in Zoolander's case. He becomes a pawn in fashion designer Mugatu's evil plan to kill the prime minister of Malaysia to keep sweat shops going. Thank goodness for Matilda an inquisitive beauty who helps Derek realize he's being brain washed. This movie is great! Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are hilarious as male models and Christine Taylor does an excellent job as Matilda. This movie is a must see, or else someone's going to be reading your ugoogaly!
B00000731Y|5.0|This is a very good record. If you like heavy metal I bet you'll like this one. It has these great riff, melodic vocals, catchy chorus and good guitar solo's. Pretty Maids are not a regular \\"hair metal band\\", but there is simularities to bands like Dokken. All I can say is buy this album and crank up the volume real loud!!
B000002UAU|5.0|A showcase for the broad spectrum of the Beatles' musical versatility and imagination. This is pioneering rock music and one of the most important and influential ablums of all time.  While arguably not the Beatles' best, &quot;Sergeant Pepper&quot; is probably their most important musical offering.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is by far the best super-hero movie to be released in quite a while, the last truly good one being the ORIGINAL Batman, starring Michael Keaton.  Just as Keaton did in Batman, Tobey Maguire brings a refreshingly human aspect to his character.  Yes, he is Spider-Man, but he is also Peter Parker, your average, every-day teen, and he faces the same problems that real teenagers do.  And while Maguire brings emotion to the role, the movie would be nothing without the spectacular performances of Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe.  Dunst, as Mary Jane, augments the emotional side of Maguire's Parker.  Dafoe gives a truly evil aspect to the Green Goblin that not many actors could pull off and still make it convincing.  All in all; Spider-Man is a good movie with a great story behind it, and it has enough action to keep even the most difficult-to-please viewer happy.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie had me going forever! I watched it three times in a row. I stayed up until 4am! I was determined not to let a movie get the best of me. But I had met my match. This movie is so confusing that it makes sense. I know I might have lost you but follow me here. It starts off with a movie starlet in a limo. Certain events lead her to lose her memory and wonder into Betty, a sweet blond from Canada's life. Together they search for the starlet's identity which takes the viewer on a mysterious ride. Just when you think you know what this movie is about, you get lost. The characters names change and people arent who they seemed before. This is one of my favorite movies. More perplexing than Momento, this movie keeps you wondering if the band is really playing. if Rebecca Del Rio is really singing, and if Betty is really what she seems. A must see.
B00005NWM3|2.0|i give this album two stars for &quot;Never Again&quot; and &quot;Too Bad.&quot;  But when I heard song number five, i froze in shock.  Was it me, or was i hearing Nirvana's brilliant &quot;Smells like teen spirit?&quot;<BR>They need their own sound.  The problem is, many &quot;bands&quot; and &quot;artists&quot; today seem to think that if they just copy someone else that made it big, it's close enough and they'll be well on their way to stardom.<br />If you want to listen to a band that sounds sort of like them, but with their own sound, i recommend Pearl Jam...they're awesome!<BR>(After the first four tracks every single song sounds the same...it's like a twenty minute song being played over and over again!   But you have to give them credit for &quot;Never again&quot; and &quot;too bad&quot;...)
B00004W52U|5.0|I love this album. Operation Ivy really wrote songs that everyone can relate to growing up. This album is for any kid who is going through hard times. From start to finish every song is great. I'm glad Operation Ivy broke up before selling out, that would have ruined them for me. This is a must have for any fan of punk/ska music.
B00004U8P9|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show is one of the best musicals ever!! The songs are catchy and the acting is spectacular. Tim Curry is hilarious and a bit creepy as Dr. Frank N Furter, and Susan Sarandon is perfect as the not so virgile Janet Weiss. This movie has captivated me ever since I watched it on Halloween as a kid. So why dont you come up to the lab and see whats on the slab, with this wonderful movie.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I found this CD while I was waiting on a friend at a local bookstore. I mistakenly entered the code number for Norah's CD on the music board, and was instantly reaching for a copy to take home. She has a wonderful voice that is reminiscent of Sarah Mclaughlin and Shawn Colvin. Her style is bluesy and soft. Her voice captures your attention and I find myself wanting to sing along. Her music is very relaxing. I am a teacher and have played this CD during class. My students enjoyed it as well and frequently ask me to play it. I recommend this CD to anyone. It's Wonderful!!!
B000002V07|5.0|This is a beautiful cd. Geeze I sound like a hippy, but its true. Hope Sandoval's voice is breath taking. Its filled with a pain that only she can express. Her voice reakes of a suicidal nature. The song &quot;Fade Into You&quot; is depressing but tugs your heart strings because everyone has felt that way one way or another. Hope sings &quot; I want to hold the hand inside you, I want to take a breath that's true...I look to you to see the truth, Fade into you, shame you never knew&quot;. Now everyone knows and everyone can see that Mazzy Star isnt your average college radio band, and that Hope Sandoval is the female equivilant of Morrisey. A must have!
B0000020C4|5.0|Out of the four different cast recordings of musical \\"Les Mis\\", I strongly recommend two of them: The 10th Anniversary Concert (1995) and The Complete Symphonic Recording (1988). Why? Because the former has the best cast, the latter has the complete musical score, full libretto, and Anthony Warlow. Both of the recordings have one thing in common, that is international cast. \\"Les Miserables\\", probably the best musical ever written, does need an international cast to do the ultimate justice.<br />Just want to take a brief look at the fabulous cast that have created this musical sensation:<br />The role of Valjean simply belongs to Colm Wilkinson. His strong and dynamic vocal delivery perfectly captures Valjean's heroic qualities. Because of this, plus his figure, I cannot accept anyone else in this role. Philip Quast portrays Javert brilliantly. His vocal strength, his dramatic expression... Nobody, in this role, can match his vocal and expressive generosity. And so is it true for Michael Ball as Marius. From high to low, from loud to soft, his voice is totally amazing. While he always sings truly from his heart, his \\"Empty Chairs Empty Tables\\" that night is heart-wrenching. Eponine, my favorite character, has gathered the most controversy in the reviews because of her player Lea Salonga. I have to say I enjoy this Eponine very much! Lea has the purest voice I've ever heard, and from her voice, I hear beauty, as well as pathos and rages. Her being \\"too American\\" doesn't bother me at all. She sings perfectly, of course. This is a one-night concert of the musical, and everyone is trying to be perfect. Talking about the perfect, there is a little nit-picking to Michael Maguire as Enjolras. He seems getting a little bit strained while reaching the pitch. I am sure he is capable of hitting his pitch more easily, but, for some reason and unfortunately, he didn't bring out the best that night. Other than this, he is tall, he is handsome, and he sings strongly. Vocal-wise, Anthony Warlow gives the best Enjolras. Feel his power in The Complete Symphonic Recording! It's absolutely not an overstatement to describe Anthony's voice as a perfect musical instrument. Ruthie Henshall creates a most touching Fantine. She feels the role and transfers every bit of tenderness and bitterness of Fantine through her unique and beautiful voice. And the unforgettable Thenardier and his wife! Alun Armstrong handles the character in between vicious and comedic just right. Another American girl in the cast is Judy Kuhn as Cosette. With a natural and clear soprano, although lacking certain inflection, she gives the best shot to a somewhat weak character.  Have to mention two young marvelous actors, Adam Searles as Gavroche shows quite a matureness on stage. Hannah Chick as young Cosette seems to be a little shaky vocally, but turns out fitting the character very well.  The last but not the least is the \\"students\\" and the choir, just wonderful!<br />All in all, this is a truly riveting performance, certainly a wonder on the musical stage.<br />If you like this CD, get the DVD, because it will only intensify the greatness by actually seeing the performance. If you don't like this CD, try the DVD, because it might change your view and you probably will start to like it.
B00004RF97|5.0|I love this movie! I normally get bored with black and white movies because I grew up in a world of color, but this movie is full of color. Katherine Hepburn is wonderful as Tracy a bride to be, but to which man in her life? This is one of the funniest movies of all time. My favorite part is the very first scene with Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn on the porch of the house. It is hilarious. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies.
0345448898|5.0|Reviewers who give books such as this strong negative reviews because the theme conflicts with their personal religous belief should not affect your decision to purchase this book. This series is not attacking the exsistence of God. To attack one aspect of this novel such as the exsitance of God is to attack the nonexistance of the armored polar bears which appear in book one of this trilogy. The person who states (in another review) \\"The author is obviously talented and it's a shame that the thrust of the trilogy was to try to denounce God's existence...\\" obviously is mistaken and has not allowed him or herself to forego this independent ridculous suggestion and denounce a quality piece of literature by Pullman. <br />For God's sake, its fantasy! The person who made this abominadble comment is misinterperting this story as one thats sole purpose is to blatantly attack the exsistance of God. Clearly this is not the case: The Amber Spyglass continues the captivating trilogy set in motion by the Golden Compass and continues to develop the characters of Lyra and Will while the story reaches an extrodinary, unprecedented and ultimate climax. It is a quality piece of work which, as Terry Brooks commented, is of the quality of Tolkiens best.<br />Do not pass the the His Dark Materials Trilogy. It is a FANTASTIC read for ANYONE, young or old, regardless of religous affiliation. Concerned parents who wish to shield their children from literature which they feel may contradict their beliefs only succeed in revealing the insecurity which they have vested in their own beliefs. As a teenager, this series revived my interest in reading of which I had previously none. It was this series that propelled me into the world of fantasy and gave incentive enough to read more difficult literature produced by authors like Robin Cook, Tolkien, and Orson Scott Card.<br />This book and the rest of the His Dark Material Series: The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass aresuperb pieces of literature which despite the aforementioned critism, have continued to maintain high acclaim among critics and readers alike. To pass up this series is most definately a mistake.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is one of the best pop dance cd's ever! Kylie did the \\"Locomotion\\" and now she just gives us \\"Fever\\". This pop queen has been around for years and we should be \\" So Lucky\\", to see her stay.
B00006690F|5.0|I'm sick and tired of people griping and complaining about Em's music.  PULEEZE!!!!  It's just music.  Why can't a song be just that----a song!?!?  You have to admit that Eminem's music is tight.  True, if you're someone who is easily offended by cussing or slang, then you will not enjoy this cd.  But for the rest of us, The Eminem Show does not disappoint.  Just like his two previous L.P.s, Eminem has a real message to get across.  Either love him or hate him, but don't complain unless you've truly heard what he's trying to say.  Two great songs: Sing for the Moment and Hailie's Song (he actually sings!!).
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento is a story told backwards.  The main character is a man without any short-term memory - he can't remember what he did 10 minutes ago, and everyone is a stranger, no matter what they've done.  Each scene begins with our hero blinking his eyes and trying to figure out where he is and what he is doing. Each moment is a little mystery to him, and to the audience.  A system of notes and tattoos that he has given himself add meaning to his life, as he is in fact pursuing his wife's killer.  Each scene is actually the scene before the last, given in reverse order, and each explains what you saw before while introducing a new mystery.  It all wraps up into a mind-blowing ending, the biggest mystery of them all.<br />It may sound confusing, but it all works, and Memento is fascinating to watch 2, 3 times or more.  Once you've figured out the mystery of who everyone is and what is going on (which can take you a couple of viewings) then you can watch this film just for its wonderful insight into human nature.  The way people change in this story has to be seen to be believed.  This is the absolute best film for peering into the mind of the mentally ill, 'cause for our hero, nothing is wrong except his one weakness, and he tries to compensate for it with intelligence and routine.<br />The DVD is a good (not great) effort, and I recommend the &quot;Special Edition&quot; over this one.  The largest sin is that individual scenes are poorly indexed, so that you can't watch the film &quot;in order&quot; and figure out what happened.  It does include a wonderful short story by the director's brother which I highly recommend you read, as it provides the &quot;backstory&quot; for the character and gives a slightly different but equally fascinating looking into his life.
0812550706|5.0|This is an amazing book on many levels. I have read Ender's Game many times and each time I learn something new. On the basic level it is your interesting sci/fi book. It makes you think though. It puts you in Ender's body so that it seems that you &quot;are&quot; Ender. Ender's Game is extremly well written and the storyline is absolutly fantastic! This book is a must read for everyone. Not just for sci/fi buffs.
B00003CXI1|1.0|I got the DVD for the special features.  But you have to spend close to 45 minutes jumping through hoops to see them.  Who's idea was this? What's wrong with the way everyone else does it?  Just make a button titled \\"Deleted Scenes\\".  I'm planning on returning the DVD to the store I purchased it from and getting the video.  Unless you have 45 minutes to waste on stuff, get the video.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This may not be the CD for all, but I found it to be a great cd. Norah's flavor reminds me of Shirley Horn and Diana Krall.  This is great dinner music - soft, relaxing.

B00003CXI1|4.0|Kids and grown-up kids alike will enjoy this film adaptation of the popular first novel in the Harry Potter series. I've never read the books (I must be one of the only people in the world at this point!) and I still thought this film was fun. It's a modern-day fairy tale with cleaver and charming scenes throughout.<br />The special effects are outstanding, and the film is increadibly well cast. There is a reason that this was a blockbuster. It's just a very entertaining and well put-together film. I hope that the next films are as successful at creating the magic that this one had in abundance.
B00004X01U|5.0|music is a good listen for 45 minutes of your time. i must admit, at first i judged the quantity of the album over the quality. this truly is a great comeback to ray of light. i think this c.d. is much better than ray of light because it makes me think of the days when madonna was still a nobody, and in the vintage club days. here are how the tracks rate on a scale from 0 to 100.<br />1.Music: the 2nd best on the album, great funky start to a deliciously good dance album. 98<BR>2.Impressive Instant: good techno song. very funky, and funny especially the dizzy spin of &quot;i like to singy singy singy, like a bird...&quot;. 94<BR>3.Runaway Lover: good lyrics, but the beat is a flop. 60<BR>4.I Deserve It: a boring song, but a catchy beat. 75<BR>5.Amazing: it's so amazing, third best on the c.d. 97<BR>6.Nobody's Perfect: i feel so sad...but yet so happy! 96<BR>7.Don't Tell Me: Go cowgirl M! 93<BR>8.What it feels like for a Girl: stands up for womens rights! a great awesome video that got banned for its content. 95<BR>9.Paradise(not for me): best on the c.d. with its asian beats and awesome acting. i especially love the part where she is crying and at the same time saying &quot;i can't remmemmberr, whhenhen i was youngg.&quot; and who can forget &quot;there... is... a light... above my head&quot;? awesome. 100<BR>10.Gone: great closing song. a great listen to when you are on your front porch. 93<br />Overall rating:90, 5 stars.<br />this c.d. proves that it is much better than ray of light by striking #1 in 26 countries.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Lynch at his best. Relatively closely based on the real-life story of an aspiring actress and her Hollywood tragedy. Naomi Watts is simply incredible; I have not seen such range from an actor in a single film before: It was like watching three different Meryl Streep masterpieces together.  But beware: like most Lynch films it portrays a dark and twisted world. Overall, a smart, beautiful, thrilling piece of art.
B00005N5S5|5.0|I'm giving the mgm release the terminator(special edition) a thumbs up,it was great watching it in a newly mastered surround sound as opposed to the old mono version,great features on the dvd as well,i was waiting a long time for a newly mastered vesion featuring surround sound and it has arrived,enjoy!
B000002I27|5.0|&quot;Strange Days&quot; is one of the great rock albums of all time. It is The Doors' second best album and fittingly, it was released right after their greatest LP of all time, their debut effort &quot;The Doors.&quot; It features some of the band's most timeless music and a few of their most popular songs. If &quot;The Doors&quot; contained the exhilarating fever and emotion of the band as seen in songs like &quot;Break On Through&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; then &quot;Strange Days&quot; is a trip down the darker realms of poetry and melody that have made the band so enduring to this day. The opening song, &quot;Strange Days,&quot; is visceral, hypnotic and contains some of Jim Morrison's darkest, strangest and disturbing lyrics and vocals. The echo effect and Ray Manzarek's organ give the song an atmospheric quality that makes this one of the band's all-time greatest tracks. This is also the record that contains &quot;Moonlight Drive,&quot; the song Manzarek says Morrison first sang to him on a California beach and convinced him of their musical possibilities. It is a dreamy tune, with wonderful, poetic lyrics and Robby Krieger playing some of his trademark slide guitar. One of the gems here is undeniably &quot;People Are Strange,&quot; it is one of The Doors' most popular songs and surely one of their best. It is wonderfully melodic and alluring and perfectly sets the mood for what it is about. Today, even more than in the 60s, it perfectly captures the feeling of isolation and loneliness. Recently Goth bands like Nosferatu and more alternative artists like Stina Nordenstam have recorded this song, but it is never more captivating or even disturbing than when Morrison is singing it. Another classic here is &quot;Love Me Two Times.&quot; It is one of the band's best blues songs and one of their funnest jams with some of Robby Krieger's best lyrics and inventive guitar playing. Aerosmith has done a roaring cover but this is THE version of course. The masterpiece though, is &quot;When The Music's Over.&quot; This song is a true rock epic, it expanded The Doors' experimentation with extended tracks as they did with &quot;The End&quot; and is just as captivating as that other classic. &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; is visceral and Morrison really comes off here in his poet, prophet, genius persona. Here we find the immortal yell: &quot;We want the world and we want it...NOW!&quot; &quot;Strange Days&quot; is an example of truly timeless modern music, it shows why The Doors transcend cultures and generations. It embodies why this band remains one of the most influential bands in not just rock but popular culture as a whole as well. It contains the melodies that have sprouted current movements like the Goth Rock groups and Industrial bands. Jim Morrison never lived to see the impact he left on rock music for all time, but he left us songs that are truly classical in that they will endure and keep touching people. Here is one of the masterpieces of theatric, artistic and visceral music.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The beginning of the Star Wars saga is definitely made for surround sound environments.  <br />While most people seem to find the Episode I plotline to be boring, or what have you, I actually thought it was a good story.  The lightsaber battle with Darth Maul was definitely the highlight of the movie for me.<br />Episode II is better than this, so if you haven't seen that, go to a theater near you NOW! :)
B00005ASOC|5.0|In this brilliantly crafted and extraordinary story of an old man and a young black boy cast into an unusual alliance, the power of friendship is revealed. Alone for most of his life, William Forrester has written one book, and that book became a phenomenal bestseller, capable of lasting through generations, and of supporting Mr. Forrester his whole life. Jamal Wallace is a young black boy living in the Bronx. Jamal loves to write, and it is through his writing that William and Jamal meet, and form a most unlikely team. Neither character believes their time spent together will be anything more than lessons learned from an old pro to a neophyte writer, but what evolves between them is a friendship so strong and so powerful, it will change each of them forever. William Forrester finds a very different definition of love than he ever thought possible, and Jamal Wallace is brought into a world that seems destined to break him, until William and Jamal together conquer seemingly insurmountable resistance to produce an individual meaning of love neither will ever forget. This movie will last a long, long time.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Join Harry Potter as he takes his magical ride on the Hogwart's Express for his first year at Wizard School. Harry is a young boy living in a cabinet under the stairs at his Aunt and Uncle's house when the film begins. He's rather abused, and noisily neglected by his aunt and uncle and greedy cousin until Hagrid comes along. Hagrid is a wizard himself, a caretaker at Hogwart's school of Wizardry. From the moment Hagrid removes Harry from his relatives, an adventure begins that will have you laughing and delighted, no matter what your age. Fantastic special effects and a long journey into the magical world of wizardry combine to make an extra special film for all ages. If you have read the book, you will find the movie is nearly a mirror image of the book, an outstanding adaptation of J.K. Rowlings phenomenal story. Within the movie, there are characters you will find your heart warming to, such as Hagrid, a loveable old thing, and Professor Dumbledorf, a wise wizard with a soft spot, and there are enough villains (or suspected villains) to keep you guessing until the end. A movie to own, to watch, to share, and to watch again. Invite your friends and have a Harry Potter evening!
B000001FSR|5.0|This is one [heck] of a CD, just wonderfull! I've bought it a few months ago and I still hear new things (Like voices far,far away and such)! But if you're not a Tom Waits fan, like I defenitly am, BEWARE!!! You'll probably NOT like it! Only if you force yourself and listen to it for about 3 times you'll hear the beautifull song under the roaring, drunk-man voice. You should first buy some more easy-to-understand CD's like 'Alice' or 'Asylum years' before you buy 'Franks Wild Years', cause otherwise you'll probably listen to it once and don't like it because you may not be able to hear the lovely melodies. But if you ARE a TW fan: BUY IT!!! It's absolutely one of his verry bests!!! Really: It's Wonderfull!!!<BR>Just brilliant!!!<br />Wouter
B00003CXUM|5.0|Perfection in cinema is an almost impossible goal to achieve.  Mostly because spectators have varying taste and perspectives.  But you can't help but feel that Wong Kar-Wai's &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is anything short of perfection.  The imagery with its lush colors and breathtaking movements is enough to elevate this film.  The simple, yet somewhat complicated tale is both heartfelt and authentic.  And the performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are a marvel.  But it's none of these that really makes this film, it's rather the manner that Kar-Wai so magically molds all these factors to set a mood that I have never felt before while watching a movie.  In all honesty, I'm really not too fond of &quot;forbidden love&quot; movies, but this film really startled me.<br />Ironically, &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; feels nothing like a Wong Kar-Wai film.  It's a very slow moving film which uses lots of fades and dissolves.  The Criterion edition of this film is probably the best dvd package I've seen to date.  There are just so many extras on it, it's hard to believe.  Deleted scenes, interviews, and promotional material, are just a few of the extras.  The way Kar-Wai shoots his films (without a script) also adds to the suprise of picture.  You see in the extras how much different the original concept was for &quot;In the Mood for Love.&quot;  There is also an alternate ending that seems very plain, but at the same time very heartbreaking.
6302814359|5.0|Actually I would rank this movie third in the series of the ROTLD.  First is the original of course, and second would be ROTLD3. At any account this movie is a very good horror flick. The storyline picks up from the first movie, and doesn't deviate much. Also it is a movie from the 80's and they just don't make them like this anymore. I especially love the James Karen and Thom Matthews characters. I laugh every time that I watch them. This movie has good dark humor, good special effects and good acting. I also love the ending, but I won't give it away for people who haven't seen it. I don't know who owns the rights to this movie, but please release it on DVD.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is a heartbreaking, breathtaking, beautiful musical. Baz Luhrmann took an allegedly simple love story, added amazing and hilarious musical twist, spectacular technical and camera techniques, and of course an amazing cast, and created the best and most special movie I've seen. Nicole Kidman is stunning and graceful- this movie brings out talent I had no idea she has. Brilliant!
B000000OQF|5.0|No collection of albums from the decade is complete without \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", the major label debut, masterpiece and zenith of Guns N' Roses. Never has a band exploded into the mainstream so fast and faded away just quickly. Like the Sex Pistols, if you blinked you might have missed a young rock band, combining their myriad influences, at their very best personified on this diverse collection of songs. You might remember the bloated corpse that it had become by the time \\"Use Your Illusion\\" was released. But \\"Appetite\\" is one of those albums which comes out every few years in which there is no filler and every song is memorable. It therefore ranks up there with the Beatle's \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and the Stone's \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" as one of the great albums of all time. The punkish album opener \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" just jumps out at you. That is the only way to describe it. It is one of those songs that had you heard it on the radio the first time you could not help but notice it. It is a rocker in every sense of the word. \\"It's So Easy\\" is a fun hedonistic song which showcases the tremendous original rhythm section of drummer Steven Adler, bassist Duff McKagan and rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin. \\"Nightrain\\" is a melodic scorcher that seems to come unglued as it progresses. \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" is perhaps a reflection of the paranoia that haunted reclusive singer Axl Rose and would eventually destroy the band. \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" is a chillingly accurate account of the band member's struggles with heroin. \\"Paradise City\\" is perhaps their biggest radio hit and is also one of those songs that jumps out at you. It starts off softly and then rips into a punishing four-chord riff that will peel the paint off your walls. \\"My Michelle\\" is a supposedly true ode to somebody they knew. Despite its subject matter (prostitution, drugs) it is intensely melodic. \\"Think About You\\" is a song Axl wrote for his first wife but a ballad it is not. It oozes with attitude, speed and scorching drums and guitar. It recalls the early days of melodic punk bands like the Go Go's. \\"Sweet Child O'Mine\\" contains Slash's signature riff and turned out to be the band's biggest hit. The funny thing is, the song almost ended up not being released! \\"You're Crazy\\" is probably the weakest track on the album. It is GNR's tribute to the Sex Pistols. \\"Anything Goes\\" is an intensely melodic number about a messed up relationship. And \\"Rocket Queen\\" closes off the album. It is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to a prostitute and contains one of Slash's best guitar solos and Axl's best vocals. Sadly, it was all downhill from there.
0395645662|4.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is an entertaining book, but it is not very realistic. The main person, called Jonas, should become the new Receiver of Memory. He is the only person in his community, who can see colours, and has feelings (besides the Giver)and so he learned how terrible it is to be the only one, who feels love. At the end of the book he decided to do something for the people in the community, but you dont know what happens to him and the community, because of this open end, you have to think about Jonas and his future life. <BR>   So it is quite interessting, but I was not very lucky about the end.
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider Man is a 5 star flick directed by Sam Raimi based on the first Spider Man comic story from Marvel.  In the movie, Peter Parker,(Toby Maguire, Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules)the spectacle-wearing newspaper geek at his local Queens high school who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, takes a field trip with his class and best friend, Harry Osborn,(James Franco) the son of Mr. Osborn(Willem Dafoe)the owner of Oscorp, to the museum.  While there, he is bitten by a genetically advanced super spider.  When he wakes up, he discovers he doesn't need the use of his goofy glasses and his body looks like its about to break out of his skin.<br />Mr. Osborne, meanwhile, discovers his own powers when he takes a company performance enhancer and his strength increases almost 800%.  Unfortunatly, it also turns him into an occasional psycotic killer named the Green Goblin.  Not a great trade, huh?<br />Getting back to the good guy, Peter later discovers other incredible abilities, like being able to jump across buildings and the famous web shooting trick.  When he decides to use his powers to buy a car to impress his crush(Kirsten Dunst, Bring it On)his plan backfires and leads him to discover the true meaning of a quote from his uncle, \\"With great power, comes great responsibility.\\"<br />This movie is everything I impatiently waited for 3 months to see.  The casting is superb, with Dafoe doing an especially good job in a scene where he has a conversation with his two personalities.  Toby Maguire put aside all doubts in my mind about Raimi's choice for casting him as Peter Parker/Spider Man.  Kirsten Dunst also does a great job, showing the audience a depth which before now has not been shown in her characters.<br />The ending is a nice twist, leaving me hungry for the sequel which will surely come.  The special effects were good enough to be liked, but may have been overused.  Same deal with the fighting.  But overall, Spider Man should get an Oscar nod or two, especially for Dafoe.  When the sequel comes, you can be sure I'll be in line to see it.

0446310786|5.0|TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is possibly one of those books that you thought (as I did) you'd read because you saw the movie. Take no chances -- pick it up and read it now! This is truly an American masterpiece. If you've seen the movie, its plot is faithful to the book. But you need to experience the subtle dances Harper Lee displays in her writing -- how she interweaves social \\"conventions\\" with the emotions and reactions of children who don't understand \\"the rules\\" because their wonderful father, whom they had always taken for granted, never taught them how to be racists or snobs. The characters are so complete I felt I could reach out and touch them. The simple narrative that explains the title is truly beautiful and becomes a heart-piercing metaphor that has stayed with me. People have written volumes about how wonderful this book is. Just do yourself a favor and read it!
B00005JKDR|5.0|My daughter saw this movie opening weekend and she still loves it after all these months. She really can't wait for the release so she can have ger own copy at home. The movie tackles a very sensitive subject among some children and I think it gives them a funny option to thinking that monsters are in your room to hurt you and that darkness is bad. I loved the movie too and found myself laughing along. Great addition to your family movie library.

If mysterious beginings and kick[in] main songs is your thing then this is the Rammstein album for you. this is a joint favorite of mine, with Mutter, making Sehnsucht a well sung played and orchastrated collection of wicked tracks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  <BR>VOTE RAMMSTEIN VOTE RAMMSTEIN VOTE RAMMSTEIN VOTE RAMMSTEIN!
B000065U1N|4.0|Of course the movie was great.  But those with home theaters would wish it was available in DTS.  No worry, the audio is great.  The sound effects has an almost Saving Private Ryan effect.<br />The special features though is where the DVD comes short.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I bought the DVD for the extra footage.  The fact that I have to play games to get to the footage would be annoying enough even if they didn't crash my computer or make my mouse disappear when I tried to play.  Additionally I don't like the way to see the movie itself you have to install their stupid dvd player which then takes over anytime I try to play any other dvd.<br />I loved the movie though.
B00005RYL9|4.0|If you like the movie Highlander and Queen, then this re-release DVD is a dream come true for you.<br />Indeed, there has been a lot of improvements in the quality of the audio and video but not yet at par with Superbit quality.<br />If you like collectable DVDs, get the Immortal Edition.  The tin case is so nice.<br />But if you just like the movie, settle for the cheaper 1-disc release.
B00005Y228|5.0|This cd is absolutley amazing. I heard the song, &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot; about a year ago on the 2001 MTV UK video music awards. I spent the next year looking for that song. Just when I about forgot it, I heard it on the radio! It then climbed to #1 on TRL and did fantastic. This album debuted at #3 on the billboard charts. It has already received gold status. Her next single, &quot;Love at first sight&quot; is sure to be a smash. Normally there is a few standout tracks on a cd, but here, all are standout to me. They are all superior deliveries of excellent dance-pop music. If you like dance/pop, or even techno, you will be very happy with this cd. I guarentee it!
B0000033P0|5.0|Tarkus (the title suite) is the one of the most complex, inventive and intense pieces of music made. It's written in 7 movements and is mostly jazz influenced. To be quite honest, it surprises me that ELP were a &quot;popular&quot; band because their music is not very accessible (i.e. easy listening) and the title suite is no exception. On here you will find the most unrelenting musical assaults (in every way possible), as the band seems to go all-out. Keith Emerson's maniacal and restless synthesizer work backed by Carl Palmer's frenzied and violent drumming is definitely a rush, if not somewhat draining (in a very good way!). Greg Lake seems to keep up with the insanity of his counterparts on bass, vocals and guitar. (Note: The thing on the cover art is half tank, half armadillo.)<br />The second half of the disc is heaven or hell, depending on where you stand with the Tarkus suite. If you thought the title suite was excellent (which many fans do), you'll probably find the second half lackadaisical. However, if the title suite seems a bit overwhelming, the second half can be seen as a welcome relief from the previous chaotic madness. Jeremy Bender is a short wild west tune. B**ches Crystal is a jazzy tune. The Only Way/Infinite Space, which is essentially one track separated into two, is more atmospheric. The former is a hymn, featuring dramatic and beautifully somber vocals from Greg Lake set against the backdrop of Keith Emerson's organ, then piano. Infinite Space is a mellow and jazzy piano instrumental. Probably the only subdued moment on the disc. A Time And A Place is mostly a hard rock tune followed by the comical Are You Ready Eddy?<br />If you want something challenging and edgy, pick this up.
B00005KA9G|5.0|I first saw \\"The Full Monty\\" at the home of a friend in Scotland. I, apparently alone on the planet, had never heard of this wildly popular flick, and really wasn't all that interested in watching it.<br />Three years later, \\"The Full Monty\\" has become one of my treasured favorites, a guaranteed feel-good experience even after multiple (too many to count) viewings.<br />Everybody knows the plot by now--down-and-out laid-off Yorkshire blue-collar workers who turn to strip-dancing to make a quick buck. It's not the plot that's so wonderful, although it certainly is a wonderful premise, but the sheer exuberant charm of the movie itself. Much like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was in ths 60s, this is just a bunch of silliness that works. From the incredibly nostalgic soundtrack to the bleak but somehow beautiful cinematography to the superb acting (Robert Carlyle is at his best here) to the understated British humor, this movie is simply a gem.<br />\\"The Full Monty\\" debuts soon on Broadway, and I shudder to think how the sheer simplicity of this film will fare on the Great White Way as a play. All the more reason, I say, to purchase and treasure this movie. If you haven't seen it, or you have forgotten how wonderful it is, do yourself a favor and get the tape. This one's a keeper
0440227534|5.0|I got to read the book by my cousin because she introduced the book to me and after I read the book, I thought that it was the most greatest and interesting  book I have ever read. <BR>   The book was about two girls named Anne Marie and Ellen. Ellen and her family was Jewish and this was during the Holocaust, so when Ellen's parents went to hide in a safer country, Ellen went to go live with Anne Marie and her family and disguised herself as Anne Marie's other sister, who died long ago. It took place in Denmark during the 1940s. <BR>    I liked the book because it had alot of meaning to me. I read the book over and over because I thought that it was a marvelous and faboluous book. I recommend this book to everyone because it teaches you what life was back then and what two friends meant to each other.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I will say this right out, this CD is not as good as their CD Tragic Kingdom! There are a few really good songs on this Cd like &quot;Underneath It All&quot;, &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot;, and &quot;Rock Steady&quot;, but the rest of it is not really that good in my opinion. Well, that's all, I guess. Check out some of their older CDs, I think you would be more satisfied with them. :)
B000002P5W|5.0|If you like music, you need this album.
B00006690F|5.0|I am a eminem fan and this CD is one of the best CD's i have ever heard! All the songs are different, he flowes like there is no tomarrow and the beats......dope as hell. Do yourslef a favor and go buy this cd!!! well worth the money.
B000002UJQ|5.0|You write about \\"No Surprises\\", \\"I could easily sleep to this nice relaxing beat.\\"  Good lord, this song is about becoming inured to mediocrity and death!<br />I shouldn't be too picky...mostly I think your review is dead on.<br />We can only hope Radiohead does another album this great.  Kid A finally grew on me.  I don't think Amnesiac ever will.
B0000041ZT|5.0|Like many classical composers who have written jazz influenced music, Shostakovich's contribution falls easily into a salon orchestra style ... or what I refer to as &quot;summer classical lite&quot;, the Boston Pops repetoire.  And when that is the music I want to hear, I turn to Milhaud's Le Boeuf Sur Le Toit or this album.  Several cuts make this a memorable album - Waltz from Jazz Suite No. 1 and the Tahiti Trot are the most obvious candidates for mention.  Jazz Suite No. 2 is a bit more somber than No. 1 but still retains the summer carefreeness typical of salon music.  The recording is of a consistently good orchestra clearly comfortable with the music ... treating it neither too seriously nor to frivolously.  A delight to listen to.
B000000993|4.0|Again, another brilliant Tool album, but I suggest not getting the earlier albums until you have at least listened to Lateralus.<br />This album is more raw than either AEnima or Lateralus,in that there are more wicked guitar riffs and less experimental sounds. But, again, be warned, homophobes; there's a lot of very suggestive m/m lyrics in here. The best track by far is \\"Bottom\\", followed by \\"Prison Sex\\" and the hilarious last track \\"Disgustipated\\". The only reason I gave this album four stars is because of its brevity...I had come to expect more from Maynard and Co. when it came to album length.
B0000025GW|4.0|It is the truth that every one of us knows that there is a God and that we need him, but unfortunately we all supress that truth in one way or another because it tends to make us extremely uncomfortable.  We like to at least feel like we are in control of our lives.  This is the wrath of God, that he gives us over to ourselves.  Well, Bob Dylan decided to recognize God's control over his life and he sings about it!  The music is great, but I will admit that Dylan's lyrics do not measure up to the depth of many of his previous albums, which is unfortunate because knowing God reaches the very depths of the human heart and mind.  But Dylan tends to sing giving his opinions, and this album is no different, except that hope is found throughout them.
B00005B36H|5.0|I must say, this album is wonderful and a must-add to any Tool fan's CD collection. And if you haven't heard Tool...this may be the album to start out on. It's less edgy and offensive than their other 4 albums, and there's less overt homoeroticism. And, from beginning to end, this is one very catchy CD. It kind of reminds me of _Break the Cycle_ mixed with the Philharmonic...but Tool and their lyrics are simply indescribable and must be listened to to be believed. Maynard James Keenan's voice is dramatic, not out there, unlike Jonathan Davis (KoRn), but they exude about the same amount of angst. <br />In short, a great album...remember &quot;Schism&quot; (track 5) won a Grammy for Best Metal Performance. 'Nuff said.
B0000062S0|5.0|Walking Into Clarksdale is my favorite ALBUM of all time. It flows together beautifully and is charged with emotion, which is an emotion more mature than that of the Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin.  I would venture to say that Page and Plant had no intention of &quot;bringing back Led Zeppelin&quot; with this album, thus there is no fruit to be gained by comparing Walking Into Clarksdale with Led Zeppelin albums concerning style.  As for quality, this album definitely surpasses the worth of your purchase.
B00000099Y|5.0|As you know, I am a huge Tool fan. This album has the same hardcore rock/emotive sound as their later _Lateralus_, but be warned, spots can get rather suggestive. But the music flows, and this CD is guaranteed to turn your brain around 180 degrees and see things differently than most.<br />In short, this is a rude awakening. A good second album to buy if you already own Undertow or Lateralus. The best tracks are &quot;46 and 2&quot;, &quot;Jimmy&quot;, &quot;Stinkfist&quot;, and &quot;H.&quot;, among others. <br />If you are a homophobe, I would not recommend this album. Look for Red Hot Chili Peppers, Staind, or SOaD for less m/m lyrical stuff.
B00003CWN2|5.0|This is a horrible movie and it's very hard to watch. I would never see it two times, one time is enough. It's a good movie, though. After watching this you will know more and you will feel more. It's like you have experienced it all. It's worth a little bit of sickness.
0553712799|4.0|I found this book to be highly enjoyable. It starts off with two Supreme Court Justices being murdered right before election day. The two men had received many death threats so there were a lot of groups as to who could have killed them. One of the men who died was the oldest Supreme Court Justice and was also the most hated. Many suspect the two murders are connected but no one has any proof because the murders were very clean and seemingly no evidence was left behind. The two men were murdered by a infamous terrorist named Khamel. He murdered Justice Rosenberg in his home and Justice Jensen in a gay movie house. There were no witnesses to either crime. Darby Shaw, a law student at Tulane University, spends days in the college library trying to crack this case. She writes a long brief about what she thinks happened and gives it to her boyfriend, who happens to be her professor. Because he found the brief to be very interesting, he gave it to one of his friends in the CIA. The brief gets passed around until the President reads it. That's when Darby nearly escapes a bomb and is forced to go on the run. Her only contact as she tries to save her life is her boyfriend's friend, the man who first read the brief.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Love this CD. I listen to it alot.. This was a very good gift. If you know someone that likes this music then they will thank you for this gift.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh portrays Shakespeare's greatest tradgedy in the most eloquent manner thus far in cinematic history.  Branagh, who plays Hamlet himself, delivers a powerful and moving performance.  Branagh truly gives the story life through the impressive cast.  Each actor portays their character with the multi-dimension that Shakespeare intended.  Every character is acutely relevant to the development in the story.  It is in this movie that it becomes difficult to distinguish between playwright and director.  There are at least a dozen scenes that are burning with tension and are unforgettable.
B000066NW0|5.0|wow, i love this chick so much!  she rocks!  and so does her music!  she is so talented, i mean this girl can scream in one song and sing in another and  she sounds amazing in both :D<BR>Here are my track ratings:<br />1.

0425180638|4.0|As a long time fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, it was almost refreshing to see Scarpetta in a new light.<br />When I finished reading BLACK NOTICE, I knew Scarpetta was in for a change because of the tragedies she'd encountered. Cornwell didn't leave me hanging -- changes and more changes for my favorite heroine, Kay Scarpetta.<br />Cornwell twisted this tough medical examiner inside out, upside down, and all around until she resembled a discarded latex glove. With THE LAST PRECINCT, we see all sides of Scarpetta, including a deeper look into what makes her tick and what ticks her off.<br />With the world against her, her job on the line, being framed for a vicious murder, and old memories getting in the way,  Scarpetta must finally do what she's never been able to do before, lean on others and let them help her. Unfortunately, even those who only have good intentions for Scarpetta, end up hurting her -- friends, family, and even her co-workers all discover a newer, more vulnerable Kay.<br />I'm excited about this new direction for Kay Scarpetta and you will be too, when you read THE LAST PRECINCT.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I'm so amused that the CD listed at the top of your current picks gets all these derogatory comments in the posted reviews. Why has this young lady risen to the top of people's awareness?<BR>My answer: class.<BR>I've been a music columnist for over 20 years, and a professional musician for 35 years.<BR>I guess everyone knows this is Ravi Shankar's daughter.<BR>I am so worn out by these know-it-alls who pan real talent when it comes along. <BR>Nora Jones is authentic. Her choice of Hank Williams' classic is no doubt sung for just these type of people who think they know so much that they have to pan her work. It's a brilliant choice of material, and a splendid, understated treatment of a classic.<BR>I could say so much more.<BR>Nora Jones has the class and depth in her soul to keep it simple, and do it right - at her age, a phenomenal acheivement. Put her next to &quot;hot tickets&quot; like Dido and Alicia Keys and you can just throw all the others in the can, as far as I am concerned.<BR>This is real music, with lucid lyrics, for real people.<BR>A welcome respite in a world full of hyped noise.<BR>That's why she is commanding attention.<BR>She's the real deal. No pretenses - unlike these snobs with their high-minded criticisms.<BR>Enjoy some real talent - and relax. You deserve it.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is one of those movies you see and want to immediately watch again, because you hate for it to be over.  Russel Crowe did a superb job.  I definantly want to add this movie to my collection.
B000063JDE|5.0|Although Lynch began as a painter his touch stone as a film director is really Hitchcock. No, we're not talking about the Hitchcock of North By Northwest but the Hitchcock of Vertigo, The Trouble With Charlie, The Birds and Shadow of a Doubt. In Many respects, Blue Velvet is an updating of Shadow of a Doubt; Lynch digs at the hidden underbelly of suburia and discovers the haunted dreams and corruption at its soul.<br /><br />The kudos that were directed to Blue Velvet are very much deserved but the film viewer should be warned; Blue Velvet is a graphic film full of emotional violence and bizarre images. Ironically, Blue Velvet was one of Lynch's most successful films (and certainly truer to his vision than The Elephant Man). When Hitchcock mined similar terrain with Vertigo he found an unresponsive audience. When it was first released, Blue Velvet provoked as much as it entertained; the bizarre, surreal opening sequence by itself makes the audience sit up and take notice.<br /><br />It took nearly thiry years for the audience to catch up with Hitchcock (by the mid-80's Vertio was recognized as a classic). No doubt, Lynch's best work will be rediscovered again by audiences. Roger Ebert's outraged review of the film (included on the DVD with the late Gene Siskel's more even tempered take on the film)was typical of critics and audiences at the time; how dare Lynch bait and provoke his audience this way! The responses weren't so different from Hitch's films Vertigo and Psycho when they were released (in the case of the Psycho much of the same critical reaction appeared in print).<br /><br />The Blu-Ray: Receiving a wonderfully rich, detailed and sharp transfer \\"Blue Velvet\\" has never looked this good on home video. Supervised by David Lynch the transfer nicely captures the crisp presentation and robust colors of the film.<br /><br />Audio sounds equally strong with a wonderfully immersive 5.1 mix that is lossless.<br /><br />The special features include newly discovered \\"outtakes\\" that add to the film. I don't think they would have added to the film if they had been restored to it (the film is perfect the way it is unlike \\"Dune\\" which really could use Lynch revisiting the materials and re-editing it rather than letting the De Laurentiis' \\"extended\\" version represent a longer cut of the film)to the film.<br /><br />THE DVD: (2002 release):<br /><br />The transfer to DVD is beautiful and captures the rich use of color as metaphor for various characters. The interviews with the stars and technical crew are interesting but, perhaps what is most interesting, is the fact that Lynch isn't interviewed. Instead, we see older interview footage shot around the time of the release of the film. Perhaps Lynch felt he had nothing to add but it is a rather strange. I would have been fascinated to hear what Lynch's observations were about the film now. Regardless, it doesn't effect the overall value of the extras.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no outtakes. Evidently most of the outtakes were destroyed so a variety of stills are used to create the impression of what these outtakes would have looked like. The dissolves between various stills creates a subtle surreal effect that actually would have worked (in a limited fashion) quite well in the film.<br /><br />One of Lynch's most complete films, Blue Velvet demonstrates all the interesting quirks that make his films worthwhile before the post Twin Peaks gimmicks. The only film that truly hinted at what Lynch was capable of was Eraserhead (a bit of trivia Jack Nance the star of Eraserhead and bit player in many Lynch films was my apartment manage when I lived in Los Angeles. At the time he was about to start work on Lynch's Dune). Both Elephant Man and Dune demonstrated that Lynch had the skill to make BLue Velvet but neither film belonged completely to Lynch.<br /><br />Although Lynch would stumble with later films (Wild at Heart for example provokes like Blue Velvet but subsitutes vision weirdness), his vision matured with Blue Velvet. Blue Velvet is Lynch's Psycho. Lynch manages to create a bold, provocative new world with Blue Velvet. In stripping away the veneer of middle America, Lynch creates a striking portrait of the darkness that drives us all.<br /><br />Bottom line: For the Blu-ray this is a high recommendation if you love the film.te a bold, provocative new world with Blue Velvet. In stripping away the veneer of middle America, Lynch creates a striking portrait of the darkness that drives us all.  Bottom line: For the Blu-ray this is a high recommendation if you love the film.
B00000DFRS|5.0|&quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; is the album Whitney should have been making all these years, from the days when she released big, soaring ballads that rivaled Mariah Carey's in the schmaltz department.  But on this album, we get slammin grooves, mainly produced by Rodney Jerkins.  &quot;It's Not Right, But It's Okay&quot; could very well be Whitney's best single ever (and the Thunderpuss remix is even better); it's an assertive, self-confident number about walking out of a dead-ended relationship.  &quot;If I Told You That&quot; (which would later feature George Michael on the grestest-hits disc) also shines, and Wyclef Jean gives the album a welcome reggae lilt on the beautiful title track.  My cut of choice, however, is a song that wasn't even released: &quot;Get it Back.&quot;  Even the Diane Warren-penned &quot;I Learned from the Best&quot; is also pretty good (which is really saying something).  Only towards the end of the album do we get a couple of subpar tunes.  Nevertheless, this album finally made it cool to like Whitney, and I strongly recommend this CD.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Many critics lauded The Strokes as the saviors of rock n' roll and their debut album is certainly exhilirating (at least initially).  But while The Strokes are certainly one of the best \\"rock\\" artists to emerge in recent years, they aren't innovative and their critical success might be further indication that rock music is no longer a viable art form.<br />The Strokes influences almost guaranteed they would be critics darlings.  Originating from a similar arty, affluent background, they're most obvious influence is The Velvet Underground (lead vocalist Julian Casblancas often sounds like a dead-ringer for Lou Reed).  On \\"Is This It?\\", The Strokes combine the sonic harshness (though less severe) of The Velvets and The Stooges with the terse, palatable song-structures of The Ramones and Television.  <br />While their influences are faultless, \\"Is This It?\\" is characteristic of a talented, but immature band that emmulates well, but hasn't learned to steal (as the old cliche' goes).  That is to say their sources are so obvious that The Strokes never really create their own identity.  These are certainly infectious songs with better than average emotional substance, but (at the risk of seeming self-righteous) they'll probably seem fresher to casual listeners than to those of us with an understanding of pop music history.  Repeated listens of \\"Is This It?\\" only reveals the superiority of The Strokes's influences.<br />The Strokes are undeniably talented, but at this stage of their career they simply aren't groundbreaking enough to deserve their anointed title of \\"rocks saviors\\".  One day, they might live up to the hype, but right now artists like PJ Harvey and Wilco are more artistically credible.   <br />One a side note:  The hype surrounding The Strokes is indicative of something I've suspected for about 7 or 8 years.  Rock simply isn't as artistically viable as it once was.  Every form of music eventually runs out of new, creative incarnations.  For instance, in jazz most would argue the last truely creative variation occurred when Davis experimented with electronics during the early 1970s.  Though still respected, jazz as an art-form hasn't seen any major progressions since and isn't the creative force it once was.  The technology that emerged in the early-mid 1990s allowed rock artists to create a few new forms, but there haven't been any innovations since.  With continuously diminishing sales and artistic credibility, rock music seems to be in the same phase jazz was in the late 1970s; respected, sometimes viable, but ultimately nostalgic.  The hype surrounding The Strokes indicates there are a few devoted trying to keep the dim flame burning, but it will likely remain dim because the creative fuel is gone; only fumes remain.
B0000029LG|3.0|&quot;History&quot; is a greatest hits album full of undeniable classics weighed down by another disc of stunningly banal material.  Jackson initially wanted to do a single disc with only a couple new tracks, and it looks like he should have stuck with that plan.  I won't go on about &quot;Billie Jean&quot; &quot;Man in the Mirror,&quot; and &quot;Don't Stop til You Get Enough.&quot;  Those hits will remain classics.  But the new material is among Jackson's very worst.  &quot;They Don't Care About Us&quot; is a misguided stab at singing about oppression, &quot;Money&quot; is as flat as warm cola, and &quot;Little Susie&quot; is appallingly corny.  Only the R.Kelly ballad &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; shows any promise.  If you're a Jackson completist and have to have it all, then you'll probably pick this up.  Otherwise, get the single-CD version of &quot;HIStory&quot; instead.
B0000214F0|3.0|This film is very graphic, but very interesting.  Don't turn it off because you see some nudity or something else that is vile...get through the whole story and then judge it. Not a great movie, but is was lavishly done.
B000002BVN|3.0|Why you should get this CD:<br />The remixes are nice!  Todd Terry gives a disco-injection to &quot;Stranger in Moscow,&quot; David Morales goes tribal in &quot;This Time Around,&quot; and Hani gives life and energy in the house-remixed &quot;Earth Song.&quot;  Farley and Heller, known for their disco-flavored jams, provide a mid-tempo groove to &quot;Money.&quot;<br />Why you may want to avoid this CD:<br />The new material is among Jackson's very worst.  The title track sounds like a reject from the &quot;Dangerous&quot; recording sessions; &quot;Superfly Sister&quot; sounds hilariously dated and lifeless, and &quot;Is it Scary&quot; is a shockingly dull mid-tempo number from Jam and Lewis.  &quot;Morphine&quot; could be the worst offender, as Jackson tries to be Trent Reznor.  Not working.<br />Overall, this record is okay for Jackson completists, but should be avoided by casual listeners.
B0000668IF|5.0|I love this CD.  It is one of my favorites.  It's hard to go wrong with MOBY.  I have three of his albums.  I was hesitant at first to buy one, but then I did and they are great.  18 works for me because of the melodic rythmns that MOBY creates!
B00003CY6L|1.0|I WATCHED THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I THOUGHT KATE BECKINSALE WAS SO GOOD IN EMMA AND MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. THIS MOVIE WAS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.  THE STORY WAS TOTALLY CONTRIVED. THEY CRINKLE THEIR NOSES AND SAY CUTE THINGS TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THEY MEET AND SEVEN YEARS LATER THEY CAN'T MARRY THEIR RESPECTIVE NEW LOVES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FORGET WHAT THEY HAD TOGETHER. THEY SHOW THEM JUST MISSING EACH OTHER IN THE SILLIEST SCENES.  THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN VERY CLEVER AND THE ONE &quot;SCENE&quot; (RATED R OR X) SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY LEFT OUT.  THERE ARE MANY WAYS A MOVIE CAN SHOW A PERSON LOVES (OR SEEMS TO) SOMEONE ELSE. IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY

0140177396|4.0|The Setting for this story is Salinas, California during the 1930's.  On the Salinas River, George and Lennie are camping out before they get to the ranch where they're going to work.<br />The Main conflict of the book is that George thinks that Lennie is going to say or do something to get them fired from their job just like the job that they had before.  This problem was easily solved by George telling Lennie not to talk to the boss and that if he did he would not be able to tend the rabbits when they get their own farm.<br />The tone of this novel is kind of slow at first, but it eventually changes.  When you are reading, you are thinking something is going to happen something different and more suspensful happens.<br />Lennie Really doesn't change that much from the beginning to end.  George, however, changes a lot.  George starts off as a pretty good friend to Lennie, but eventually turns his back on him.<br />To me the most moving scene in the novel was when Lennie was hiding in the brush and he invisions his Aunt Clara and a rabbit telling Lennie how he betrayed George by what he did to Curleys wife.<br />I feel that John Steinbeck's purpose in the book is to show that even your closest friends can turn their backs on you.<br />I learned, from this novel, that human nature is hard to deal with when you lose a close friend by backstabbing and betrayal.<br />This novel reminds me of the time I lost a close friend from arugments, backstabbing and arugments.<br />My overall feelings for this book are that, it is a great book to read.  Even though it is kind of short, you get a lot out of it.  You mainly learn about good and bad friendship.  I strongly reccomend this book to anyone.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver tells the reader the story of Jonas, who lives in a community, which seems to be a perfect world by having very strict rules. At his Ceremony of Twelve he is selected as a new Reciever of Memory\\". That means that he gets to see things which the others in the community aren't able to see. Gradually, Jonas notices what the real world\\" looks like. <br />Our opinion:<BR>It's a good book for a school-book. The beginning is very boring, but page by page it gets more interesting. Especially the moments when Jonas gets the memories are written very well so that you can imagine these situations. After the first chapters, you don't want to stop reading the book. The book makes you thinking about our own society.<br />We would recomment to read this book! :o)
B0000640SA|4.0|Remind self, return rental \\"Memento\\". Confused at first, maybe even angered at editing tricks. Then got really into storyline, the \\"who do you trust\\" aspect. Guy Pearce was really good, really carried the film. Enjoyed it overall, but liked \\"Usual Suspects\\" more. Makes me look at Tom Hanks 'Mr. Short Term Memory' skits on SNL in a new way....<br />What tha hell? Why did I rent this? Movie jumps back and forth, editing tricks abound, story(guy with no short term memory looking for his wife's murderer) seems to be starting from the end and working its way back to the beginning. Maybe its trying to be clever; give the ending first, then explain everything as the story progresses backwards to the very beginning. Interesting....<br />Just sitting here, bored. Let's check out Amazon.com's DVD section. Hmmm. Recommendations. \\"Memento\\". 600+ reviews, average of 4 1/2 stars, good to great reviews stressing originality. Sounds good, might rent it and check it out. DVD edition looks cool....<br />(note: if you find this review remotely confusing, DON'T even attempt to see this movie!  See, I'm going backwards in my review like the movie...starting with the last event first, then regressing back to the beginning to show how/why I ended up watching the movie.  Similarly, the film takes you back to show how it led up to the final...oh never mind.  Just rent Bio-Dome with Pauley Shore instead.)
B00003CX5P|5.0|the sequal has come out and it is just as good as it
0811826848|5.0|I thought that this would just be a worthless coffeetable gift book, but it turned out to be great.  This is a must-have for any fan of The Beatles.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is the best movie. I bought it and i love the xtra features plus the real movie
B00004ZAV3|4.0|It's great to have all of these number ones on a single disc.  The only real drawback is that these songs have been taken out of their larger contexts within the various albums.
B00004VW0V|5.0|This album is great, Cat Stevens was a incridible voice like the song\\"Honey Man\\".I have to admit,\\"Morning Was Broken\\" was wonderful in my opinion.\\"Moonshadow\\" it was the second song in my opinion in the greatest Cat Stevens songs.<BR>This album make Cat Stevens a superstar!!!!!!!!
B0000636UN|2.0|I don't know what most of these reviewers have been smoking, but this album is, by far, the least compelling of Sheryl Crow's studio albums.  Just go back and listen to &quot;Sheryl Crow&quot; or &quot;The Globe Sessions.&quot;  The differences are stark and obvious.  I hope she snaps out of it with her next album.  Hey Sheryl, lose all of the guest vocalists and get back to the gutsy writing of the previous two albums.  As far as I am concerned, this album is fluff.  Use it as a ninja frisbee.
B000001EG6|5.0|In my opinion, &quot;Elton John&quot; was the best album in 1970.Elton and his band make a best work in songs like&quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;Border Song&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Madonna(in the remastered edition)&quot;.The strings of &quot;The Greatest Discovery&quot; was wonderful, &quot;Your Song&quot;, was a massive hit when the album was released.The album makes the Billboard Top 10.This Elton first America album(second in UK) was great.
B00005QZ7U|2.0|As I say, its a very pretty movie, but it would have been nice had there been more to it.  first time I watched it, I loved it.  Second time, not so much.  Now, I refuse to watch it again for fear of going into shock.  Worth a watch, but didnt hold up to repeated viewings.  Proves once again that covering a bad film with glitter and dancing girls does not change the essential stupidity of a bad film.  Plot as predictable as a rock, in that it goes nowhere.
B000062TU1|1.0|I'm afraid I'm not very positive about this film.  I could barely make it to the end.  As a student of film studies, I have to say that filmmakers today, especially Hollywood filmmakers, are tending more and more to rely on special effects and quick shots of people's expressions, and not enough on ACTING!  Even the great Maggie Smith was reduced to a series of melodramatic poses and shallow facial expressions.  And I was ready to tear that plasterboard fake smile off of Daniel Radcliffe's face by the end of the movie.  I'm afraid he, like the rest of the characters in this film, suffer from terminal cool.  I suppose thats what kids today want.  And you can bet Hollywood will deliver.<br />The film is also excessively violent.  If you compare sections of the film with the way the story is told in the book, you can see the added amount of gratuitous violence.  Children and creatures are hurled around and smashed against things like they're images in a video game.  Realism?  Get real!<br />The special effects on the DVD are so loud, I had to keep turning the volume down.  But then I couldn't hear the dialogue, so then I had to turn it up again.  Too much noise, too much violence, not enough genuine acting, sophisticated storytelling, and human interaction.  Period!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem just shows his talent when it comes to putting out tight flows faster and more precise then anyone in the game right now. This cd is his best yet, testing all his boundaries, including some singing.  I don't find any of these songs to be nearly as bad as all this new trendy rap [stuff] coming out these days. I say if you like good rapping and tight beats, then you should get this cd.  but if you want some horribly written, party tracks that just make you dance then go buy some big tymers or nelly garbage thats out there.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This movie is not bad, the special effects are good and the acting is very good, kids will love it, adults will be mildly entertained. I found it to be very uninteresting and predictable in spots, not worth the money for a purchase. I hope that the books are more interesting than this movie.
B000050XEI|5.0|All Enya fans will love this album which was release in late 2000. Her voice is gentle and relaxing compared to those other terrible singers like britney spears, cristina aguleria, jessica simpson etc etc, all those artist who songs are pointless and insignificant. Enya music is high above those artist all her music is soothing and relaxing, and especially in this album with only time which is a big hit since last september's tradegy. And I totally love the other's like a day without rain is the intro which is a nice blend of piano and other instruments which is so relaxing. Second of my favourites is wild child, Flora's secret and Lazy days which is the last track on the CD. Listen to lazy days and after when the CD is finish you will still hear that song in your mind listen to it and you will see. This is a must buy for Enya's fans if you are a Enya fan and you haven't bought this please do now!
B000066C1N|5.0|This wonderful CD and the movie it comes from is the first animated movie and CD that I have truly loved.  The music puts it all together and there isn't one song on the whole CD that I do not like.  It is a great story and the music tells it all.  I couldn't be happier with the CD's or the movie's SPIRIT!
B00005ASOI|2.0|I bought this largely due to rave reviews here.  What a shock<BR>to realize I had seen this before - in its theatrical release.<BR>Didn't like it then, don't like it now. The music's just wierd enough to be compelling, and I like Jessica Harper, it's just that the movie is less than the sum of its parts.  Blurry red hallways, funhouse lighting, cliched characters (check out the Cloris Leachman-like teacher with the German accent and the vaguely militaristic outfit) - I just don't get the appeal.<br />Might seem raw and arty to someone who never saw a foreign film before.
6304493681|2.0|Ok this movie had awesome visuals. There are about two fight scenes that were the coolest things I've ever seen. Other than that it stunk. It tried too hard to be in depth and thought provoking but it somehow missed it's goal. Like the main character's lovely 10 minute speech where they show a close up of her face as she rambles \\"I am me and that is why I am myself. I am an individual bacause I am the one no one else is like and so I am me. That is why I am not you and there is only one person who is I...\\" or something along those lines. Very ...very boring. Then there was another long time consuming part that was once more trying so hard to be deep. It was about another ten minutes of just showing scenery of the city while they played freaky music. ummm ok, so this is suppoosed to show her accomplishing what, finding the meaning of life? Yeah so a couple awesome fights and a cool demented guy that had a picture of \\"his family\\" (u'll know what I mean when you see it) was not enough to save this movie. It is worth viewing at least once though. Perhaps if you borrow it or something.
B0000028PI|5.0|I don't know much about Alice, other than Only Women Bleed is one of the defining moments of Rock. I would have never bought this, had I not heard him live on Rockline in 94, when it came out. Rockline is an interview show on every Wed.I just happened to be listening, and I heard Sideshow.I thought, wow, they're playing some OLD alice!! I had no idea it was brand new. Most of the stuff I heard from Alice from 85 to 92 I didn't like, I thought it was overproduced  in the vein of BonJovi(no pun intended).Man In The Mask and Hey Stoopid were good,but way overproduced. This was the first great stuff I heard from him in ages.When I bought the album, I was floored.I thought for sure it would be a huge success.Unfortunately, I would have never even heard this kind of brilliance had it not been for Rockline, as the radio didnt touch it.My favorite track is still Sideshow-but Unholy War is a close second.It's Me is very cheesy,but extremely heartfelt, which removes a slice or 2 of the cheese.Lost In America is a lot like Beastie Boys- Fight For Your Right. Bad place Alone and Stolen Prayer are standout tracks.Glad to see Jack Blades from Night Ranger cowrote a lot of the tracks, as well as Chris Cornell-P>S Does anybody love Temple Of The Dog as much as I do???
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a compelling novel about the difficult first years of Ender Wiggen. This is by far the best science fiction book I have read, and has become one of my favorite stories of any genre. Orson Scott Card wonderfully portrays life on our future Earth. I could clearly visualize each setting because they were described with such detail. <BR> Ender is a young boy (6 to about 13 throughout the book) who is a military tactical genius. He is sent up to a Battle School in space where he and other remarkable children his age are trained in to fight and command in a zero gravity \\"battle room.\\" Aliens have attacked Earth twice and are expected to attack again sometime soon. The Military is hoping to select students from the school to lead the defense. Ender always wins all the games and is by far the most promising of all the kids. He is isolated and pushed to his limits in all of his training. He is so good that he is sent to Command School where he further continues his education. He fights battle simulations against his teacher, who is surprisingly, as smart as Ender.<BR> I would strongly recommend this book to any reader even if you're not into sci. fi. This novel flows along without a glitch, and all the plot twists will keep you from ever putting it down. It is one of the books that makes you sad when you finish it, just because it's over. I would not be surprised if you read this book in one sitting because I know that you will enjoy it as much as I did.
0553208845|2.0|I had to read Hesse's Siddhartha for my literature and philosophy class.  It was a quick and easy read.  This book definitely opened a lot of interesting philosophy questions like what is the meaning of life and the everlasting quest for truth.  Siddhartha, on this quest, strives to find truth in a seemingly meaningless world.  Despite this being a good book introducing some facets of eastern religions and opening up philosophical questions, it was also an extremely contrived book.  As I was reading, I didn't feel that Siddhartha's story was unique to him, but instead it was Hesse's attempt at generalizing the experiences of every single Eastern religious person who goes on a quest for truth.  Look at Buddha for example: he started out as a rich prince and then got sick of the material world, and then went on his little journey to find truth.  If you were to summarize Hesse's Siddhartha in a nutshell,  you get the same story.  Yes, this journey is interesting, but so what? It wasn't unique, and extremely stereotypical.  If you want a good introduction into eastern thought, read this book, but if you know at least a little about Hinduism, Buddhism, etc. don't read this, because it basically retells you everything that's already expected and known.  Siddhartha, in the end of the book, does indeed find truth, and the reader thinks sarcastically, \\"Wow, I didn't see that coming.\\" There are no surprises, which can make this a bit dull to more adventurous readers.
B00005JKTF|5.0|\\"Charlotte Gray\\" is a film which has left me stunned, amazed and grateful at the chance for being able to see such brilliance. The movie consists of a simply thrilling storyline, beautiful scenery and wonderous acting on the parts of every character. It is a film for those who are willing to believe anything is possible - that \\"there must be something to set against all this\\".<br />Charlotte Gray is a young Scottish woman who falls in love with a soldier who goes off to WW2. His plane crashes, and so, she becomes a spy to go to Occupied France to rescue him. Upon arriving in the Vichey France; she meets a team of revolutionaries and a new, and tangled storyline emerges from there. Many criticise both book and film for shirking on the WW2 accuracy, but I feel that it *concentrates* on ceratin aspects of the War, instead of skimming over about twenty different circumstances.<br />Cate Blanchett is unbelievably good as Charlotte - she performs excellently and you can see how her character changes and grows throughout the film. Her stirring speech at the near the end of the movie is simply amazing - she delivers it with feeling and emotion. Billy Crudup took my breath away. He was more than fantastic in his role! He breathed life into the character of Julien, and captured my imagination with his performance. Truly excellent! Notable mentions go to all the other actors, but Billy and Cate stole the show, in my opinion.<br />If you are looking for a fantstic movie that will take you to another time and place, make you think, and allow you to both remember the pain and tragedy that WW2 brought; and the hope for humanity that was displayed by the brave people who fought for good -  Charlotte Gray is the movie for you. <br />10/10 - Simply Amazing!!
B00005U11Z|5.0|This is a spectacular set worthy of the Journey name. All of the hits and the new songs from Arrival all done louder and in some cases better than ever. Steve Augeri knows his voice and how it fits in a song regardless if its old or new and he shows it staying strong through out not pushing and sounding great even better IMHO than the &quot;Greatest Hits Live&quot; CD released with Perry on vocals. Buy this DVD if you are even a casual Journey fan its money well spent to hear a band doing it this good after many years.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is possibly Austen's most grown-up romance, the best work of a great writer. And this fluid adaptation completely charms. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root captured my heart as Frederick Wentworth and Anne Elliot, the star crossed lovers who meet up again after years of separation and must cope with their society's not so subtle but unspoken strictures. The settings, on the beach, at Lime, or in Bath are particularly interesting. And Corin Redgrave gives a highlight performance as Anne's narcissistic father, Sir Walter.

0345448898|3.0|I am am eight grader and when I read this book back in the 7th grade, it flew right over my head.  I did not understand this and I did not get as much out of this book as more mature people may have.  Even though I am only a year older, I may understand it more.  It was very good and a great piece of liturature, but I recommend it for 8th, but probably 9th or older.
0451196716|5.0|I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, but some of his books and short stories are pretty good, and I truly loved this novel and regard it as his best.<br />King would no doubt be amazed to hear that anyone regards \\"The Long Walk\\" as his \\"best\\" book; it's one of his earlier books, written in the \\"Carrie\\" era when John Travolta was king of pop, and it was originally a \\"Bachman\\" novel - that is, written when, for experimental purposes, King hid his light under the bushel of a less famous pseudonym.<br />Well, his later novels might have a more mature \\"style\\" and might flow easier, but the pace of this one is more tense and the characters are remarkably likable.  And I'm amazed at how much confusion there is about what happens at the end.  Reasonably intelligent people giving the ending an adequate amount of thought should have little trouble figuring it out.<br />Set in a futuristic era, ruled by a military dictatorship personified by \\"The Major\\", the story is about 100 boys of high-school age who set off on a \\"Long Walk\\" which requires them to maintain a pace of 4 miles an hour, come steep hills, hell, or high water.  Anyone who has walked a treadmill knows that this is quite a brisk walking pace.  The ostensible goal is \\"The Prize\\" - everything that you want for the rest of your life.<br />When a Walker drops below 4 miles an hour, he gets a warning.  Three warnings are all that a Walker will get, though an hour without a warning enables the Walker to get rid of one warning.  If a Walker slows down below 4 miles an hour while he's walking with three warnings, he's eliminated from the race.  With extreme prejudice.  By soldiers in a half-track armed with rifles.  The winner is determined after 99 Walkers have been eliminated.<br />Although this is both an early novel and a Bachman experiment, it's still vintage King - a macabre walk of death taking place in a recognizable middle-class setting.<br />So King makes the occasion as festive as positive, adding his normal helping of cheerleaders, gym squads, Cub Scouts, Little League players, Italian fruit merchants, Grant Wood families, civic clubs, and automobile salesmen to the mix of spectators that cheer on the Long Walkers and roar at the crack of the rifles - as usual, this is King's way of accentuating the horror that he has created by \\"mainstreaming\\" it.<br />Still, speaking as one who utterly despises endurance athletes, I see tremendous possibilities in this idea.  If one could find a way to eliminate the lion's share of many thousands of real-world smug cliquish androgynous leisure-class weekend warriors that clog up metropolitan areas with their self-loving marathon fests and who clog up their other environs during the remainder of the week, what a finer, happier world we would live in!<br />But the graphically-portrayed deaths of these boys aren't enjoyable at all.  They are both pointless and heroically tragic.  Even while making the Walkers very recognizably and coarsely adolescent, King is also able to make them quite endearing in their own way, much more endearing than the yuppie scum who participate in real-life marathons.  As did other readers, I also enjoyed the camaraderie among the Walkers, made especially poignant by the knowledge that they had no hope of meeting again after the conclusion of the Walk.<br />King's \\"message\\" is somewhat garbled by the curious \\"game show\\" quotations that precede most chapters, but it becomes clearer when a later chapter instead begins with a radio announcer's call from the second Cassius Clay/Sonny Liston fight:  \\"The blood has begun to flow...Clay is killing him...Clay is killing him...Oh, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how to describe this scene.\\"<br />Clearly, King means for this novel to be a \\"statement\\" against the violence of sports culture.  It's a typical left-wing bogeyman, as is the right-wing military dictatorship that organizes \\"The Long Walk\\" as both ritual and money-maker.  In real life, the intellectualoids who govern us would never tolerate the rule of a military that they hadn't already taken over, as far back as the McNamara era.<br />And as athletes become wealthier and more yuppified, violence in professional sports has become less, not more prevalent, Mike Tyson notwithstanding.  There is scarcely a millionaire sportsman today who would ever do anything as gauche as engage in open warfare for the good of the team.<br />And while King agonizes over the \\"culture of violence\\", in the real world, young boys are severely disciplined for even having violent fantasies, such as bringing cap pistols onto school grounds or pointing an index finger at a rival and yelling \\"bang\\".<br />Is the stench of violent death that pervades the world of \\"The Long Walk\\" any worse than the stench of antiseptic that pervades our own?  And for all of the horror of the fictitious world that he created in \\"The Long Walk\\", is Stephen King aware of how relatively ATTRACTIVE it also is?<br />He's on the right track when he describes the Major's presence as \\"very masculine and overpowering\\".  The world of the Long Walk is all that and it is also scrupulously fair - both in the un-coerced manner in which Walkers participate and in the way that the rules of the Walk are disclosed beforehand and enforced honestly during the Walk itself.<br />\\"The Long Walk\\" is an excellent story which attacks largely non-existent targets, a story about a world not as nightmarish as the author intended, but considerably more alluring.<br />In another setting, Stephen King himself has repeated the maxim that \\"it is the tale, not he who tells it.\\"  He doesn't know how right he is here.<br />I'm giving King 5 stars for this novel, but I'm also ordering him to re-read the 1948 Ray Bradbury short story, \\"Pillar of Fire\\", for a more accurate view of what the future looks like now.

B00000AFGM|5.0|This is the best album I've ever listened to in my life. The title track &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot; is a great song, as is &quot;The Dope Show&quot; and so many other songs on this release. Manson struck gold. Not his heaviest album, but definitely my favorite album of all time, Manson explores how different he can be with his music. I didn't find anything bad about this CD. I'm sure all Manson fans and anyone who is into alternative styles of rock and industrial metal will all appreciate this album.
B00000K0DK|5.0|Citizen Kane is truly one of the greatest films ever made and deserves all the praise it and the wonderful Orson Welles have garnered, Mr. Welles was and is definitely one of the best filmakers ever! I had this on video but someone made off with the tape, I'm going to replace it someday but this time on DVD and I will make sure that no one takes off with it! Some people said they thought it was boring, it's just my personal opinion but I didn't find it boring at all, it was a very interesting film and is a cinematic work of art and very highly recommended to all film buffs!
B0000636UN|4.0|After a long wait we finally get the fourth Sheryl Crow album and what's more it's probably her best to date.  Obviously influenced by 70's country-rock this sees Crow in a whole variety of moods - fun, contemplative and even sad.  What's more it even feels like a day's progression in an odd sort of way.  Starting off her album with light, hip and fun tracks 'Steve McQueen' (a personal favourite) and the bubbly 'Soak Up The Sun' Crow is more playful than she's ever been.  Middle of the album comes 'C'mon, C'mon' and the superb 'Diamond Road' are perfect dusty afternoon tracks whilst 'Weather Channel' and 'Missing' draw the evening to a close.  It's very bizarre to have an album that feels like this and it works perfectly, even if it wasn't intentional.<br />This is an incredibly consistent album with plenty of fantastic songs that stand up there with old hits 'A Change Would Do You Good' and 'Everyday Is A Winding Road' they are the perfect accompaniment to a road trip, and that isn't meant as an insult.  In particular 'Steve McQueen' is exceptional and tracks such as 'Diamond Road' are very insightful whilst 'C'mon, C'mon' is beautifully honest.  This is a sunny summer album that everyone can sing along to.  Sheryl Crow has come out on top again.

B00003CXI1|3.0|I was quite disappointed when I saw this movie.  I saw it after The Fellowship of the Ring, which was about as close to the book as movies get, and so all of the plot changing annoyed me.  And while I guess the computer animated effects couldn't be too realistic or they'd scare the smallest kiddies, I found the three-headed dog laughable.  <br />There were some positive things.  I love the books, and I did find the characters and their dialogue similar.  I was entertained throughout, and found the magic amazing.  <br />So the movie was entertaining and fun, though not of the highest quality.
B000003N89|5.0|This is Diana Krall's best work to date.  She's a good singer but a brilliant piano player in the Nat Cole tradition.  I'd love to see her in a dark, smoky (not in California) piano bar performing these tunes. From &quot;Errand Girl for Rhythm&quot; to &quot;Frim Fram Sauce&quot; and all the rest of these Cole classics, this album reeks of class. If you need one Diana Krall album, this is the one.
B00005JIZA|5.0|Music is just not the same without John Mayer.  Room for Squares is a wonderful start OR addition to your John collection.  As much as I enjoyed Inside Wants Out, RFS takes his music to a whole other level.  He brings classic Jazz back to the pop rock scene.  From the catchy No Such Thing to the relaxing, yet melancholy words of St. Patricks Day this cd will have you singing the whole way through.  There isn't a way to have favorites with RFS because every song is amazing.  If you don't have the cd yet, GO GET IT!
0060977493|4.0|Roy's critically acclaimed novel, The God of Small Things, is not an easy read about another culture.  There are few surprises in the story of this novel.  What there is, however, will force you to keep reading until you have absorbed every word of this lyrically-written novel.<br />The book is the tale of two twins, Rahel and Esta. Rahel has returned to America to see her brother, who she has missed for years since he was sent to live with their father after the death of their cousin, Sophie Mol.  Seeing India, and Esta again after so long, brings Rahel back to the weeks prior to her cousin's death.  In recollecting these times, she begins to understand how the caste system has shaped her existance, and comes to an understanding of the 'love laws,' which dictate who we should love, and how much.<br />This book is beautifully written and should be appreciated.
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you don't have this cd in your collection yet, you NEED to get it!  Norah has a beautiful voice, and my personal fav, The Nearness of You, will make you want to cry.  The whole cd is great, she has a wonderfully jazzy feel, and her piano skills are amazing.  This cd is so relaxing, I listen to it in the car on my way home, and rush hour gets alot calmer.  I would definitely recommed you check her out!
0553260111|3.0|I was drawn to this book after seeing trailers for the upcoming movie, and googling Ludlum online (I had heard of him before, but never pursued further) led me to several thrilling endorsements based on his frequent bestseller status (though we all know that bestseller status frequently does not equate to quality of writing). After reading it, I would like to concur with the other 3-star review I saw here. In spite of the fact that the story in itself is intriguing, I nevertheless found the writing to be almost juvenile in style. Not to say, that this was poor writing, but it certainly was not more than a few cuts above pulp. Nonetheless, for an occasional guilty pleasure of a read, it will suffice just as a occasionally, I find myself watching the USA network on TV late night.
B000002H2Z|5.0|This has so many great songs! I remember when I saw The Cure live a couple of years ago and didn't know a single song, when I heard 'Push' from 'The Head On The Door', I was like &quot;Wow, that is SO good!&quot;. Then I bought the album and discovered little jewels like 'Six Different Ways', 'Close To Me', 'A Night Like This' and also 'Sinking'. My boyfriend is mad about 'The Head On The Door' and he was not a Cure fan when I met him. So this album is very accessible, more than their early albums. From A to Z you won't be bored a second with 'The Head On The Door'!

6305907145|1.0|I have read this book and from that I think the movie was poorly scripted and poorly cast.  The main character was not like the one in the book.  Also, there were elements, like the slavery issue, that may have been important at the time, but were not in the book explicitly.  There were too many elements apart from the book and this DID NOT lead to a good movie.

B000002LQR|5.0|I'm not discovering a new continent by saying there are things that completely change the universe after being invented. Such things like the wheel, electricity, the machine gun, the car, and finally, Red Hot Chili Peppers' 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'.<br />I've grown up with this album and I can't even imagine leaving it. 'Blood Sugar' isn't just a music CD, it's something to identify with, a vital piece of what I am.<br />I know some people start listening to a CD with tracks they already know like the hit 'Under The Bridge'. Here you better leave it, feel 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' like you feel a movie.    <BR>'Power of Equality' is a good opener with an excellent guitar solo. 'If You Have To Ask' is a party song with a party chorus and groovy background guitar. Now enough of the warm up, it's time to start the main show.<br />'Breaking The Girl' is a beatiful lovesong, it has a dramatic flute and Anthony's vocals are very impressive, not to mention the famous Frusciante Guitar in the beginning. 'Funky Monks' is a song about the Peppers themselves but also about every man out there. 'Suck My Kiss' is one of my personal favorites, it's even better than the hit 'Give It Away'. 'The Righteous And The Wicked' contains the best choir vocals and the funkiest guitar part. The songs 'My Lovely Man', 'Greeting Song' and 'Apache Rose Peacock' are outstanding because dominated by the genius of Flea who plays the most melodic bass I've ever heard.<br />My favorite song is 'Sir Psycho Sexy', it's a movie itself, the last 2 instrumental minutes remind you that even  the best adventures gonna end. Afterwards you can't imagine a life without 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik'. This album changed your universe, too.<br />P.S. <BR>Let me know if my review was helpful, Blood Sugar is my all-time favorite.

Ok, they were pretty good at acting.  the girl who played Hermione Granger has been in a small play, that was her acting experience.  Ron had hardly any acting experience.  I don't know about Harry , but they're what? 11 years old?  I liked it all around.  You should definately buy this video.
B00005AQAW|4.0|In many ways, this record can be considered as a new chapter in Feeder's career, suggesting that the band has left behind their underground stardom in order to fully cross over into the mainstream; although their previous albums and singles had sold in respectable numbers, Echo Park\\" was the band's real artistic and commercial triumph and has sold more than 100.000 copies so far - for a variety of reasons: First and foremost, Feeder managed to pull no less than four brilliant singles from Echo Park\\", with two of them shooting into the UK top 20 single charts. Second, the album features a decidedly more pop feel than all its predecessors: The dynamic production fully fleshes out the melodies and lends a superb drive to such rocky numbers as Buck Rogers\\" and Seven days...\\", while the vocals of Grant Nicholas, who also wrote all the songs and has evolved into the role of the band's visionary, wrap around the music with more flexibility and confidence than they ever did before. Whereas other indie-rock bands often struggle to come up with half-way memorable songs that keep the listener coming back for more than one time, Feeder simply explode with utter catchiness here, both lyrically and musically. In short, they pull off everything we like about those early-'90s dance-rock bands such as Chapterhouse, combine it with everything we love about the immediate guitar attack of grunge rockers like Foo Fighters, and on top of it garnish the whole thing with the sing-along melodies of the more meaningful pop-punk outfits such as The Breeders and Weezer. The two biggest hits on the album, the already mentioned Buck Rogers\\" and Seven days...\\", are both superb examples of the band's abilities - Buck Rogers\\" starts with a moody bass line and rather restrained vocals, but the refrain with its fierce guitar drilling is so gripping that it's impossible to resist the sheer energy that bursts out of the speakers. \\"Seven days...\\", while working in a similar vein musically, displays how Feeder even at their most convincingly radio-friendly sometimes love to approach things from a slightly ironic angle, even if the lyrics are somewhat trite. The volatile opener Standing on...\\" is another winner, effortlessly mixing sweet-sounding verses with rumbling dance beats and interludes full of all-out guitar thrash. In general, the album's first half does make for a great listen by any yardstick, although We can't rewind\\", Turn\\" and Piece by piece\\" may come off as slightly unmemorable first because they do not feature that big guitars and tension-filled refrains that distinguish the best numbers on this disc. But Piece by piece\\" with its strange, repetitive stop-start rhythm and rather dreamy vocal delivery improves with each listen and ensures that even the band's softer and more reflective stuff can make a lasting impact on the listener. However, after the appropriately titled, charming Turn\\" it's mostly downhill as some of the album's remaining numbers get a bit mired in cacophony and weak songwriting when compared against the highlights of \\"Echo park\\" and \\"Polythene\\". The best offering on the disc's second half is the 5 ½-minute Satellite news\\" (taken from the CD-single release of \\"Piece by piece\\" and added as a bonus piece to the UK edition of \\"Echo park\\"), a fairly melodic tune that weaves together ringing guitars and thoughtful lyrics with a strangely hollow, slow dance rhythm. \\"Choke\\" and \\"Tell all...\\" get the tag of 'not bad'; these songs are not inferior by general standards but simply do not stand up to \\"Buck Rogers\\" or \\"Seven days...\\". Unfortunately, the album-closing tracks Under the weather\\" and Bug\\" are truly marred by a muddy, flat-sounding mix and lots of unnecessary distortion, with \\"Bug\\" being a particularly unsettling and forced exercise in heaviness. It should be said, though, that these missteps are clearly in the minority here and do not detract much from what is a bloody good pop-punk album.<br />As aninteresting bonus, the Japanese edition of \\"Echo Park\\" contains four additional tracks originally recorded for the \\"Just a day\\" EP and the CD-single releases of \\"Buck Rogers\\", so the import version is well worth tracking down for fans who do not want to buy the often-desired \\"Just a day\\" song separately. In sum, \\"Echo Park\\" confirms that Feeder have truly created some engaging and uplifting music which could be the perfect soundtrack for your next beach party; if they were Americans and on a major label, the critics as well as the record-buying public would be jumping up and down about it.n interesting bonus, the Japanese edition of \\"Echo Park\\" contains four additional tracks originally recorded for the \\"Just a day\\" EP and the CD-single releases of \\"Buck Rogers\\", so the import version is well worth tracking down for fans who do not want to buy the often-desired \\"Just a day\\" song separately.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I've heard people complain and say that this movie is too much of a kids film, but that's being unfair to kids films. If you want to see a more creative kids film then watch &quot;The Neverending Story&quot; or &quot;Labrynth&quot;. This movie's trailers hyped up the podrace, but if you want to see an exilarating ride watch the magic carpet ride from &quot;Alladin&quot;. Finally if you want to watch a kids film with good characters then watch &quot;Goonies&quot;.
B000001FA4|4.0|The tribal drumming, lightly chiming guitar, beautiful lyrics and vocals, and an overall organic sound on \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" to begin this 1984 record might make one long a bit for the U2 of yore. A more arena-ready sound -- in the form of big drums, meaty guitar work and larger-than-life vocals -- fully makes its presence known on the following song, \\"Pride (In the Name of Love),\\" an `80s anthem if there ever was one. But there's nothing wrong with anthems, and U2 have always done them well. This record was the start of some truly great music from the band, top to bottom.<br /><br />The vibrant \\"Wire\\" has a bit of an early-`80s new-wave vibe to it, and Bono's vocals are on fire throughout. In contrast, the title track is more relaxed but with a desperate feel in the lyrics, as if there is something better just around the corner.<br /><br />Things get even more interesting on the back half of the record, where a more epic desertlike vibe shines through. The calming and ethereal sounds of \\"4th of July,\\" \\"Bad,\\" \\"Elvis Presley and America\\" and \\"MLK\\" are practically transcendent. (Bono's lyrics \\"To let it go! And so to fade away! from \\"Bad\\" are brilliant.) \\"MLK,\\" dedicated to civil rights leader Martin Luther King, is also beautiful. Bono, in his most heartfelt way, delivers a stirring ode to the historic American figure: \\"Sleep tonight, and may your dreams be realized,\\" he sings sublimely on the song, over a deep, mournful and somewhat foreboding synth.<br /><br />This album is a snapshot of U2 on the rise. Musically, it contains both a staid and exciting feel, not abundantly electronic like future records, and not as dated-sounding as some of the early U2 stuff. It's a good atmospheric mix, a great warm-up to [[ASIN:B000001FS3 The Joshua Tree]], and for my money, stronger and more substantial than 1983's [[ASIN:B000001F3C War]].
B00000J7RZ|2.0|I liked Jennifer Lopez as an actress and I was younger when this album was released so I wasn't as selective with my purchases. With the exception of &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot;, which is a superb, funky dance song that I can see being played in clubs even ten years from now, the rest of the cd is all manufactured pop where the video is a better work of art than the song. <br />&quot;If You Had My Love&quot; was a alright light catchy song but after hearing it in the media so much it gets tiresome. &quot;Too Late&quot; and &quot;Open Off My Love&quot; walk the same line as &quot;If You Had My Love&quot;. &quot;Let's Get Loud&quot; is quite loud with all the horns and the infectious salsa beat but it's just sheer celebration. Jennifer does not have the strongest voice and range so the Celine Dion-ish ballads (&quot;Talk About Us&quot;, &quot;Promise Me You'll Try&quot;) sound like a bad demo tape. &quot;Could This Be Love&quot; had the seeds of a haunting song with a dark edge but her shaky vocals and the watered down music ruled that out. Let's not forget all that talk of the Latin movement! Hey, a few salsa instruments splashed about for show could be classified as Latin music (right). You have to give it to Jennifer though. The exposure on radio and music channels have boosted her to superstar status.
B0000027RL|4.0|Along with 1993's [[ASIN:B0000028UK Vs.]], Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" nicely represents the band's more monochromatic years. Familiar, from-the-heart and with a classic rock sound splattered all over, the first six songs on this disc roll off like an early-'90s \\"best of\\" compilation for the masses. Future PJ albums would place a greater emphasis on melodicism and often contain a more abstract vibe, but it's hard to discount the solid material on \\"Ten.\\" After all, this is the first time the entire world got to hear Mike McCready's whirling-dervish guitar solos and Eddie Vedder's angry growl. What more could a rock fan ask for?<br /><br />For me, many of these songs have become, if anything, too accessible and overplayed throughout the years. I prefer PJ's work on [[ASIN:B000002AZ8 Vitalogy]] and beyond, but this is still good stuff. As a college kid in the early 1990s, I can still envision people at bars \\"slam dancing\\" the night away against the back drop of such blood-stirring tunes as \\"Once,\\" \\"Evenflow\\" and \\"Why Go.\\" Conversely, \\"Ten\\" also showcases a slower, more poignant side of PJ on songs like \\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy,\\" two of the band's biggest songs. \\"Jeremy\\" is an especially moving track, a sad tale of gory suicide within the classroom, made all the more real by Vedder's pained and emotive vocals.<br /><br />Some of the more interesting tunes from this disc are the ones not heard on the radio. \\"Oceans,\\" for example, has a daydream quality to it that makes for a nice break from the heavier rock tracks that surround it. \\"Porch\\" might be the album's best song, with its fast-and-furious lyrics that seem to build to a catharses moment for Vedder: \\"Hail my name/Take a good look/This could be the day/Hold my hand/Walk beside me.\\" \\"Garden\\" has a mysterious, trippy vibe that sets it apart, while \\"Deep\\" is heavier with a bluesy feel. On \\"Deep,\\" Vedder lets loose with his harshest yowl to begin the song, and many of PJ's best elements are showcased throughout. \\"Release\\" is the epitome of heartfelt emotions for an epic closing song, with Vedder's weary baritone amid tender guitar to start things off. That baritone transforms to a soaring, larger-than-life crescendo of a chorus -- next to music that is as equally soaring -- which makes \\"Release\\" the perfect tune to end this landmark album.<br /><br />The all-for-one mentality of PJ served the band well at the start, though fractured elements soon seeped into the band's facade of armor. No matter, though. Pearl Jam has turned out to be one of the most steadfast, prolific and talented band in the history of rock and roll, and this is where it all started.t emotions for an epic closing song, with Vedder's weary baritone amid tender guitar to start things off.

B00005JKJA|5.0|People who understand and appreciate film as an art to explore will enjoy this movie. People who only liked to be considered as consumers, just go to the current blockbusters, and thought &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; was too mind baffling will be confused out of their mind while watching &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.<br />It is reminiscent of the old 50's Hollywood. The main characters are Betty, an aspiring actress, Rita, an amnesiac who enlists the aid of Betty, and Adam, a director who is being forced to choose the star of his next film. The movie plays, pull strings and goes beyond the premise of the characters' situations. Personally, I think David Lynch revels in toying with moviegoers as they try to piece together this puzzle of a movie where pieces were never meant to fit into a complete picture. As Roger Ebert said, it's not like &quot;Memento&quot; where if you follow closely you can solve it, just enjoy each scene for what it is. I have my own theories of the movie's plot but I'll leave that for you to decipher.
B00004WG2X|4.0|I have only seen the old P&P with Greer Garson, et al. so when my sister loaned me this video I was surprised and delighted.  So much more true to the book.  I thought the lead actors were superb and although Mr. Darcy was wooden and stiff, I believe that is the way the character was in the book.  I found his facial expressions revealed so much more than his words.  It really is more like a play than a movie and should be viewed in that style as theatre and movies are two different things!!!  I have not yet seen the Colin Firth version and look forward to it, but I recommend this version at least for comparison.
0156907399|5.0|To the Lighthouse is a dazzling work of art that illustrates with great clarity the dynamic nature of human thought and perception. \\"How can an artist do that?\\", one might reasonably ask.  Well,if that artist is Virginia Woolf, the answer is, \\"With unmistakeable genius\\". While Woolf's influence is seen everywhere in works of literature that would follow, one must keep in mind that the literary technique employed for most of the novel, stream of consciousness, was still very radical and experimental at the time it was written. Woolf's portrait of the thoughts that pass through the minds of family members and their houseguests at the seaside and her harnessing and transformation of the essence of time and into words is nothing short of awe-inspiring. That she also manages to tell a story and develop rich characters that the reader cares about while painting these portraits of thought and time is utterly amazing. Then, there are her words which connect it all;  beautiful words that flow like the sea and color like a paintbrush. It is no accident that one of the main characters, Lily, is a painter, who with her strokes of the brush intermingling with her thoughts, tells this story. <BR>  Although considered a modernist, as was James Joyce (who also employed stream of consciousness in his works), I found this novel more accessible than Ulysses.  It was as if Woolf wanted to create a work that would touch as many people as possible, while Joyce had developed a private code that only a select few could crack. While (trying) to read Ulysses I felt intimidated, left behind; while immersed in To the Lighthouse, I felt invited and included. For a taste of modernist literature at it's most inviting and poetic, I recommend To the Lighthouse!

B000002UJQ|4.0|This never has sounded like Pink Floyd to me, and although there are some Floydish passages, there are also sections which remind me of U2, The Beatles (White Album), Porcupine Tree, and Islands/Lizard-era King Crimson.  The greatest album ever?  I doubt it.  Although I think it will go down as a classic, there are many similar recordings which have been around for years but never received recognition.  Progressive Rock (never a darling of the critics) has produced many influential and conceptual landmarks of the same quality as OK Computer.  Since, i don't see this as a &quot;revolutionary&quot; piece of music, I only give it 4 stars...but a very strong 4 stars.  If you don't own this, buy it (as well as Kid A)...if you already own it and are just perusing the reviews, check out the following recordings:  &quot;Signify&quot; by Porcupine Tree, &quot;The Visitor&quot; by Arena, &quot;Brave&quot; by Marillion, and &quot;You&quot; by Gong.

0452282152|4.0|I read this book for school and loved it. While it was slow in places, the beauty of the story is umistakable. I could truly relate to Griet, and everything she went through. I could see her life clearly. the book showed her as a person and her as a model. The two were in many ways very seperate people. Her hardships with van Ruijven made her a like to maids evrywhere, but she was differnt. Her descriptions of Vermeer were by far the most interesting. His character while not imposing, has such a definite personality. The painting itself is beautiful, but after reading the book I looked at it in a new light. The description of Vermeer readying Griet to be painted, made me constantly turn to the cover to ook at the face of the girl and compare. This is the first good book I have read in a long time and I advise everyone to read it. It's not a long book, but it is powerful.

B00000273M|5.0|I ordered this CD primarily for the well-known Bangles hits such as 'Walk Like An Egyptian', and 'Eternal Flame'.  Instead, I discovered that their music was much, much more than the hits.  These girls were so talented -- not only did they play their own instruments, they also traded lead vocals.  <BR>      <BR>       And they could harmonize with the best of them.<br />       Highlights include:<br />02.  Going Down To Liverpool:  Perhaps the Bangles most rocking track, this is a wonderful, Mamas And The Papas-inspired (Debbi Peterson's creamy vocals remind me of Mama Cass, as does the arrangement and production) track.  Addictive.<br />03.  Manic Monday (# 2 US):  A Prince-produced track, this is perhaps the most pop-oriented track the Bangles ever cut.  It certainly is danceable and the lyrics are fabulously unique, as with all of Prince's material.<br />04.  If She Knew What She Wants: Susanna's vocals are melancholy and regretful in this ballad-lite rocker.  It's made great, though, by tight harmonies and wonderful guitar work.<br />05.  Walk Like An Egyptian (# 1 US):  Everyone knows this one.  One of the most catchy dance tracks ever cut.  The girls share lead vocals on this one, and those lyrics are just....wonderful in their own quirkiness.<br />08.  Hazy Shade Of Winter:  A remake of the old Paul Simon song.  Very choral in tone, with some virtuoso electric guitar and drum work.  <br />09.  In Your Room (#5 US):  Susanna Hoffs is kittenish and coy (despite the lyrical content) and the track, which has psychedelic guitar riffs and a killer bass line is an absolute delight.  This track is proof positive of the Bangles' consumnate musicianship.<br />10.  Eternal Flame (#1 US):  A rare torchy ballad (by Susanna Hoffs), which doesn't really fit in with the rest of their catalogue but which is a classic in its own right....like nothing they did before or after it.

B00000K19E|2.0|I'm sorry, but this movie is dumb. When I went to watch the 1st time, I wasn't ammused. The story is easy to figure out (a greek philosipher came up with this theory along time ago) and the effects, well, they were to laugh at. They were the worst special effects I've seen. They look so fake. Even the film's highlight was unippressive. You could see a little black outline around the girl when she jumped up and paused in the air. I don't know why everyone thinks that so good. The reason it gets two stars is because it tried to be original, but sadly it's taken a story that has already been told and hollwoodized it. I'm not that easily ammused Hollywood. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 look great. ...

079284632X|5.0|This film is a harsh film that deals with subjects that all of us find offensive. It's scary and disturbing, that is what horror is suppose to be. It's suppose to make you feel uncomfortable, and make you keep your nightlight on. This is real horror! Scream, I know what you did last summer, Night of the living Dead, Valentine, Jeepers Creepers, and 13 Ghosts are not horror movies. Those movies were made for kids. I heard people trying to say \\"oh this ain't scary\\" then they try to convince themselves of that by pointing out every little flaw and mistake, for this low-budget film. I guess it makes them feel smart. These people, also thought that Ernest scared stupid was frightening. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to bad reviewers, they just want you to think they are tough, they aren't, they think they have something to prove. This story is harshly realistic, and happens to people. Now come on Hollywood, when will you get it through your head, that your new \\"horror movies\\" aren't scary. They have a few jump out at you surprises, and people call it scary. The people that don't like this, probably didn't make it all the way through because in their reviews they try to tell what went on the film, it's funny how it seems they got all of that from the back of the box. Now please actually watch the movie before you review it. For fans of this film, don't worry horror moves in cycles. This year it is out, but soon it'll be in again. Keep waiting.
6304698798|5.0|Near the end of the movie is the scene where the three men face each other, and the camera looks at each man's eyes, their determination, their fear. Another scene, just as Blondie/Man Without a Name/Eastwood shoots the rope which would've hung his friend, capturing the incredible concentration in the midst of confidence Blondie must have to get the job done.<br />&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; packs in so many great scenes such as these, that it has become one of those films directors are insprired by.<br />The theme song, that hauntingly familiar hushed whistle-like tune, ranks in my book as one of the perfect songs for a movie. Ennio Morricone's score integrates well overall, as he draws from the theme throughout.<br />Some movies need to be on the big screen. It is a shame no one re-releases this sort of movie into the theaters, where the panoramic vistas and so-close-you-can-smell-the-sweat closeups would shine. It is a big movie.<br />Clint Eastwood plays his role with such convincing demeanor, I'm amazed when I see him play in other roles as deftly. I can't imagine another man as Blondie, chewing on an unlit cigarette/cigar, unshaven, sweating and dirty, and the gravely voice.<br />The DVD aspect is lacking, I'm afraid, in extras. There are a few extra scenes, but out of context, they simply don't add much to my experience. I'm not sure what might've been appropriate, as, in so many ways, the movie is enough. Significant clips from other Eastwood flicks, especially his westerns, might've been nice.<br />I fully recommend &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
B000002LGQ|5.0|Like A Prayer is Madonna's best single ever, and the album the peak of her career so far. That is nothing new to any true fan.<BR> I just find it ridiculous to read that the the title track is &quot;surprisingly good&quot; once you can forget the video. The song's impact comes with the images of that timeless video in mind, with its atmosphere, its message, and Madonna's looks and style of that particular period -- and also all the reaction the video got. The song, the video and the entire album stand out as one of the greatest works of the 80s. <BR> Madonna is in a league of her own. As much as I admire Cyndi Lauper, those two artists shouldn't be compared, even if they emereged at the same time, with -- admittedly -- a similar style and music at the beginning. They both have a different approach to music and fame, and should be measured by that. It is only natural that Madonna with hers has lasted longer, but that doesn't say much about Lauper.

FLYing works because it's a state of mind, and somehow FlyLady knows what's in our hearts as well. Buy her book, shine your sink, and nothing less than your whole life will change.  That's a promise.
B000002MY3|5.0|Okay, let me say that I'm more of a Korn/Eminem/System of a Down kind of spread, but I bought this because I knew I liked a couple of the songs (basically &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Ironic&quot;) and I heard her new &quot;Hands Clean&quot; on the radio. When I got it, I listened to it full through, and since have listened to it probably 18-20 times (I got it about 10 days before writing this review).<br />Great album, I actually enjoy every song on this CD, and highly recommend it. She has everything from just fun songs to really touching songs. I'm very impressed.
B00005A1VH|5.0|When I sat down to watch this movie, I was ready for a lot of war action.  The actual fighting, which took place in WWI, does not appear until very late in the movie, and only battle shown is the one he won the Medal of Honor for.  This is still a fine movie.<br />The bulk of the movie is on the growth of the man from Tennessee.  We start with his drunk and rowdy days followed by his decision to buy some land so he can propose to a local lady.  In riding to a fight, he receives a sign that leads him to the church.  This is the focus of the movie.<br />Looking at the box and seeing the movie, I found that York was not fond of war.  His religious beliefs influenced him to resist going to war.  After a time reflecting, he realizes he must fight to protect the freedom and way of life he loves; he fought because he had to.  I learned that York did not want to do endorsements or make a movie because he was afraid it would glorify war.  He agreed to have this picture done about him when America was preparing for WWII.<br />I would highly recommend this movie.  This is definitely a must-see.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Ok as some of you have found out by now, it is really hard to find the deleted scenes. There is an 8 step process using the DVD menu to get there, or you can use this short cut. Put your DVD in the player then hit stop. OK now go to track 77. I say again go to track 77. There you will find 7 deleted scenes.<br />Swish and Flick, it's like magic.
B00005JKCF|4.0|As with Batman, Superman, and the X-Men, this is the first movie (probably) of a comic book hero.  I remember hearing rumors as far back as the 80s of a movie version.  Although it was a long wait, this was worth it.  This is very well done.<br />Like the X-Men movie, this movie is not word-for-word from the comic book.  The writers and director of this film have merged some characters and tweaked some of Peter Parker's powers to ease the transition to the big screen.  For instance, Spiderman's web-shooters are actually part of him rather than a device he creates.  I believe this is for a more general audience rather than just the comic fans.<br />As a comic book fan, I do not mind the changes made.  This is an exciting movie, and you can't help but identify with Peter Parker.  I recommend seeing this movie.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I've read the book and the seen the film and they are of equal calibur. Harron and Turner's screenplay is very faithful aswell as well adapted. Many have described Patrick Bateman(Christian Bale) as too shallow and pathetic, and they are 100% correct and this is the premise of the story (or lack of it).<br />Patrick Bateman's indifference to the mayhem and violence he inflicts is far more brutal and shocking than the acts themselves, yet in equal amounts, it's extremely funny. The film can be enjoyed the 50th time as much as the first unlike many psychological movies. I liken it to Taxi Driver where society had become so unconnected that killing other fellow humans has no meaning.<br />Bale's performance is extraordinary and is entirely convincing. Dafoe's appearance is also delightful.<br />The DVD film transfar is very good quality with just a few scratches on the opening credits and the music and sound are very professional and are reference quality as far as Dolby Digital goes.

B00005V9HH|5.0|An absolutely wonderful movie. A top-notch cast, well written script, and wonderful directing give this movie a life of it's own. Bryan Singer's opus.<br />Transfers: Perfect in every which way. No artifacts in the visuals. The audio is wonderful. Be sure to crank it up when the 5.1 is busted out.<br />Extras: The only DVD out there that beats this one on extras is the Episode 1 DVD. The deleted scenes are absolutley wonderful, and one wonders why they were deleted. The featurettes are a bit obscure, but still a lot of fun to watch. The \\"Keyser Soze - Lie or Legend\\" is great. The Gag Reel is fun, as all are mostly. Listening to Singer's commentary is absolutley fun. But the best part of this DVD is the Easter Eggs. Trying to catch them all is hard, but lotsa fun.
B000068FUK|5.0|When Alvin Lee & Ten Years After were first invited to play in America by legendary rock promoter Bill Graham in 1968, they wanted to release an album to coincide with the tour. Their second studio effort was incomplete, so the decision was made to release a live album. The result was one of the best live recordings of the period and arguably one of the best live rock & blues albums ever. As indicated in my Visual History book on Ten Years After - when Alvin Lee first heard this album he thought, \\"Well, that's it, that is the best we will ever play and there will be problems recording in the future\\". Fortunately things turned out much better for Ten Years After but, upon listening to UNDEAD, it quickly becomes evident that Alvin's initial fears were not unfounded. This album \\"smokes\\" from the onset and the musicianship is remarkable throughout. Ten Years After were quite different from the many other \\"2nd British Invasion\\" blues bands because they fused jazz into their music and that characteristic is exemplified here. \\"Woodchoppers Ball\\" and \\"I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always\\" are absolutely stunning and every bit as impressive today as when they were originally recorded. A few critics later sought some sort of perverse pleasure in claiming Alvin Lee's guitar playing was \\"all haste and no taste\\", but none of that is evident on UNDEAD. His highly accomplished and precise technique on the aforementioned two songs sails circles around most recordings made by the so-called \\"guitar gods\\" at the time. The four new tracks, comprised of material originally excluded due to vinyl LP time limitations, now make the album even better. \\"Spoonful\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" were, of course, played by almost all of the British blues bands. Alvin even introduces \\"Spoonful\\" as a \\"Clapton/Howlin'Wolf number\\", in reference to Cream's version of the song. It is a treat to hear TYA's version of these tunes with Alvin's own inimitable guitar work. In the great booklet that accompanies the CD, drummer Ric Lee describes the newly added \\"I Can't Keep From Crying Sometimes\\" as being, \\"a bit rough around the edges\\". But, although it is not quite the polished version found on future TYA releases, it's very much a \\"diamond in the rough\\" being an early and quite interesting version of the song. The closer, \\"I'm Going Home\\", is half the length of their famous Woodstock version that would emerge more than a year later - although it is every bit as energetic, and perhaps even more so. I strongly recommended the other TYA re-releases (Ten Years After, Stonedhenge, Live At The Fillmore East 1970 & Cricklewood Green). They all have bonus tracks and great new descriptive booklets authored by Ric Lee, including the original artwork plus several additional rare photos. If you have not heard any of them, I suggest you start with UNDEAD -..It Rocks !!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I seldom buy a DVD, as there aren't many movies I could sit down to watch more than once, but this movie is a buy. And this is from a guy who likes action movies. <br />I have two critiques: one, the casting. Kidman doesn't have that face you can feel sympathy for. And Ewan? Well, they should've left him back in one of those Jedi movies. Second, the producer has to get over his Madonna fixation: there were  too many Madonna songs, and some of them just didn't fit. <br />Fortunately, the rest of the movie surpasses. Choreography was top notch; and if you ever wondered what Burl Ives would look like singing &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; then you've come to the right place. <br />If you enjoyed the classic Jose Ferrer version, you'll enjoy this one too.
6305537321|5.0|Breakfast at Tiffany's has always been one of my favorite films!  Ironically, in the book Holly Golightly is clearly understood to be a call girl. The move production code of the time made such a characterization impossible, so Holly is painted as a party girl who's suitors give her a $50 bill for the powder room (not sure why you need money for the powder room!0 The movie is a pleasure from beginning to end. Hepburn's performance is endearing. The ending always brings tears to my eyes. It's one of those movies that you can pop in the DVD player on a lonely Saturday night, a bowl of popcorn, and a box of Kleenex for the end!

As one reviewer said, &quot;Just go ahead and buy every Tool album you don't already own&quot;.  This one is a must.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|Yes, this is a MUCH better version of Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot; than that with Kate Beckinsale! OH, that one had been such torture for me, that looking at this one again a few weeks back was quite a joy.<br />Gwyneth does a superior job of conveying Emma's own sense of superiority, which is particularly necessary for this heroine, the sole example in Austen's work of a protagonist at the top of the social ladder. Every other young lady in Austen has always to answer to SOMEBODY along the way, but part of Emma's problem is that she has no one to please but herself. Indeed, this is why she encounters as much trouble as she does, because no one can dare counsel her, except Mr. Knightley. <br />We're still not quite there yet with the Mr. Knightleys, but this fellow at least appears to come from the upper class, whereas the Beckinsale one was decidedly not. Miss Bates, the middle-aged penniless parson's daughter, is on the other hand superb. She's the same actress who played Mary Mosgrove in that excellent &quot;Persuasion&quot; some years back. Mr. Elton is served up exceedingly well, too. Somewhat out of Dickens, in the vein of  Uriah Heep.  <br />To give the Beckinsale one its due, though, I must admit that it had the better Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax. Jane in Gwyneth's is too vague a character to amount to much, and of course, she must!<br />Alas, the character of Lucy still comes up empty. Last time, she was a pale nonentity. This time, she has a stronger silly persona, but is played by a rather lumbering largish person who is not pretty. I presume the casting was thus to ensure that Ms. Paltrow didn't have any competition in her own movie. Lucy, as I stated in the earlier review, is VERY pretty; in fact, her very prettiness is what draws Emma's notice, and convinces Emma that Lucy must marry well, setting off all the matchmaking in the plot.            <br />But still and all, this is the &quot;Emma&quot; for me!

Their CD is high-paced, play it loud for an adrenaline rush. If you know Good Charlotte, Blink 182, or Ultimate Fakebook, then you'll know what I mean, and trust me this CD is a perfect example of this. They're just an emerging band, but please help them emerge, they're really amazing.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is awesome!  My friends and I saw them open up for Sugar Ray back in April the week before the CD came out, and were bummed that we had to wait an entire week to get the CD.  These guys have a lot of talent in both song writing and performing.  Even Mark McGrath said (during the concert) that one day Sugar Ray would be opening up for Simple Plan.  I definitely recommend this CD!

It holds its own.<br />In \\"Gods,\\" Shadow is a convict days away from his prison release. Before that can happen, however, he learns that his beloved wife, Laura, has been killed in a car crash. After his release, at her funeral, a woman spits on Laura's corpse. When confronted by Shadow, the woman reveals that Laura was having an affair with her husband, also killed in the crash.<br />His world shattered, Shadow stumbles into the employment of the mysterious Mr. Wednesday, who asks him to take on the role of occasional bodyguard, in the interest of protecting some shady dealings and interests.<br />From there, Shadow eventually comes to discover that his new employer and associates are long-forgotten gods, no longer worshipped by humankind and now doomed to live amongst their ranks.<br />Even worse, the new gods of pop culture's worship, like technology, wood and mass media, to name a few, are out to bring down the gods of yore and claim dominance.<br />Along the way, Shadow runs across a few familiar gods (very few - Gaiman has said in online interviews that one of his points was to use old mythological figures that are more obscure, so the use of Greek gods like Zeus is sort of pointless) and fantasy creatures, some of whom are given creepy new spins under Gaiman's imagination.<br />He also finds himself tormented by his dead wife, literally, when a gold coin from a leprechaun proves enough to raise her from her grave.<br />There's more to the story, of course, and Gaiman does a good job of telling it, even if things start off somewhat slow and it's hard to retain all the information he's giving. But Shadow is a great character for an audience to follow, likable enough to keep readers interested and cynical enough to give the fantastical goings-on an air of realism to them.<br />It's a fabulous, fabulous concept in theory and Gaiman has got the goods to make it live up to its fullest potential. All the elements are there, and it proves to be a book where idea and creator are well in sync.<br />The gods must be pleased.his dead wife, literally, when a gold coin from a leprechaun proves enough to raise her from her grave. <br />There's more to the story, of course, and Gaiman does a good job of telling it, even if things start off somewhat slow and it's hard to retain all the information he's giving.

6301797906|5.0|This 1940 film, based on John Steinbeck's novel depicts the searing injustices to a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers during the Depression.  Who can ever forget the Joad family, forced off their land during those difficult times?  Henry Fonda is cast as the older son, out on parole, but who chooses to travel to California with his family in search of jobs.  John Carradine is a former preacher who joins the family.  And Jane Darwell, cast as Ma Joad, won an academy award for her performance.  I read the book years ago and it will forever be seared in my memory.  And even though the film left out the most memorable scene of all, I was moved by the family's plight, as they joined the great migration to California in a rickety truck.<br />The film has stood the time well if viewed as a history lesson.  It was a horrible time in America and it certainly is realistic in depicting the  times in general and the plight of the Okies in particular.  Some of the dialogue though, is a bit too preachy, and it's hard to believe that it would have come from a poor share-cropper's mouth.  The hardship was relentless and hard to watch and there was little opportunity for the characters to make choices.  However, this is just nit picking on my part.  On the whole, I feel it is a serious film well worth viewing, especially for those who find it difficult to understand what living through the Depression was like. Of course I recommend it.  It's a classic.
0783219598|5.0|I have no idea what corporate dolt made the decision not to release this film in a letterbox edition, but it utterly mars the DVD version of one of my favorite films from the last ten years. The reason I buy DVDs is because of the superior picture, but one of the reasons DVD is superior is the fact that you can see the full--i.e., letterboxed--picture. This DVD chops off each side of one of the most visually beautiful films made in recent cinema. This decision was just a dreadful mistake. This is a film I would purchase on DVD if only it were available in letterboxed format.<br />Still, I give BABE five stars because the film itself is just so delightful. I think most viewers focus on the story, and I am enough of a kid that I enjoyed it thoroughly. But other things seem to get overlooked. The human performances are just as charming as the animals, and if Magda Szubanski and James Cromwell (who received a well deserved Oscar nomination for his role as Farmer Hoggett) hadn't been so superb, the movie would have been nothing but a technical display. The art direction for this movie doesn't get the praise it deserves, probably because people perceive it to be a kid's film. But very, very few films look this good; the art directors created a unique, beautiful, and magical looking world.<br />Interestingly, the person who did the voice for Babe is Christine Cavanaugh, who does the voice of Chuckie on Rugrats. The voice for Babe in BABE: PIG IN THE CITY was done by Elizabeth Daily, who does the voice of Tommy Pickles on Rugrats. Keeping it in the family. The voice of Rex, the Sheepdog, was by Hugo Weaving, who played the main Agent in THE MATRIX and Elrond in THE LORD OF THE RINGS: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.
0887306101|1.0|Here we get interviews with trading &quot;wizards&quot;.  What you are actually getting is the same tired advice of cutting your losses etc. etc. I suspect that people who read this book think they are being let in on insights and &quot;secrets&quot; of how these traders are so successful. After all if these &quot;wizards&quot; cant tell you who can? Ever try truth and logic?  If you did, you would see what a crock this book is.  Most traders are using the advice in this book, so why arent they as successful as these &quot;wizards&quot; are?  Most people including publishers believe these people have &quot;secret knowledge&quot; and if you pay their outrageous prices for courses and books they sell, you'll be a success.  Baloney.  People who believe this believe in magic.  They subconciously believe that if the wizard touches them with their starry wand or takes their magical advice they become instantly successful. Sure you do.  The truth is so simple, many people overlook it.  The truth is you have to have true knowledge and great mastery.  Thats it.  You have to figure the truth out yourself, instead of having it spoon fed to you. Unfortunately, many people believe in magic.  They want something for nothing.  This attitude is what causes sorry excuses for books like this to be published.  Success always requires a price to pay.  That price is hard study and hard work to gain mastery.  Thats something these market &quot;wizards&quot; dont tell you and if you look through most if not all trading books, they dont tell you either.  Why?  To keep you paying up.  They keep you chasing for the gold at the end of the rainbow.  Did I let the cat out of the bag?  Heck no! In the intellegence service they have an old saying &quot; The best way to keep something secret is to lay it out in the open.&quot;  True words indeed.  Some people will find the truth and most will always miss it right under their noses.  Read Acres of Diamonds by Russell Conwell.  There are many good books on trading.  Unfortunately many are over priced.  Before one had to pay these prices for what he needed.  Luckily, Toni Turner has written several outstanding books on day trading and short term trading. They are reasonably priced and offer valid knowledge.  Her books are better than the Market Wizard tripe and are very practical.  Also beware of greed.  Its the greatest reason people get killed trading.  Trade to pay your bills and put food on the table.  Dont learn the hard way. Greed will nail you one way or another. Count on it.  Call it money karma.
B00003CXA6|5.0|What is most remarkable about this movie is how closely it followed the real life story of the Battle of Gettysburg.  <br />The movie tells the story of the battle to almost a fault (the only scene I take issue with is the scene where Jeb Stuart meets Lee)<br />The portrayal of Winfield Hancock is outstanding, and Brian Mallory should have won an Oscar for his supporting role.  Mallory had Hancock's personality and battlefield magnetism down to an art in this movie.  <br />Martin Sheen does an adequate job of portraying General Lee (even though Lee was much taller than is Sheen).  Of course, Jeff Daniels gave an oustanding portrayal of Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, who's defense of Little Round Top literally saved our country.  <br />Every person I have showed this movie to, agrees it is one of the best war movies ever made.  Literally you feel as though you are on the battlefield as it was raging around you.  <br />As a former Civil War re-enactor, the scenes were so realistic, Im shocked that no one was hurt making the movie.  <br />This movie is more than worth the price listed. <br />To me, with the exception of Titanic, the best movie ever made.  <br />Enjoy, and happy viewing
B000002U8G|4.0|The first 'real' Pink Floyd album, 'Meddle' leaves the remnats of the group's psychedelic past behind them and marks the beginning of their most productive decade (the 70's). Guitarist Dave Gilmour's growing confidence within the band is almost palpable as the trademark sounds begins to coalesce. There's a new sense of purpose and direction about the album's two standout tracks, 'One of These Days' and 'Echoes', despite the fact that both rely on ideas that have already been explored on earlier albums like 'Atom Heart Mother'(1970) and 'Saurceful of Secrets' (1968).<BR> Rick Wright toys with the Dr. Who motif on 'One of These Days'. And after drummer Nick Mason's disembodied voice intones 'One of these days i'm going to cut you into little pieces', Gilmour takes over with some searing slide guiter. But 'Meddle' is dominated by the 23-minute 'Echoes', which builds gradually but deliberately from the opening piano sonar 'ping' through a series of clevely linked fragments, to the tension of Gilmour's exquiste guitar cresendo before the final verse lets you down with a cosy glow.<BR> The other 4 tracks on the album are largely forgettable. although the wistful 'A Pillow of Winds' has a certain pastoral charm. But it matters not; Pink Floyd had reset the contols for the heart of the 70's, and in the process had reveled their real potential.
0060920084|2.0|This was probably the last Bill Bryson book I will read.   I can't help feeling he put almost no effort into it.   He drove around America for a few weeks, and spent a few weeks writing two, maybe three drafts.    As one of his earlier books, he throws in some often strained \\"hilarity\\" (which sometimes was actually pretty funny, had me laughing out loud and looking forward to reading more), in the style of Paul Rieser's \\"Babyhood\\".   His descriptive writing is sometimes good, but nothing so very special overall.   But the real problem with this book is that he did nothing on his trips but wander around in a car, and the only people he spoke with were waitresses, order-takers at fast food joints, hotel clerks and gas station attendants--and then the only conversation was about how to meet his needs of the moment, and his only commentary is on how inept they were at doing that.   Bill dresses up his little jaunt with some cheap talk about American wealth and industrial structure, to make it seem like serious commentary.   But this is no journey to discover America.  Compare to \\"Blue Highways\\" by William Least-Heat-Moon, and you will see how facile this book really is.   Even a book about Bill Bryson driving around America getting into drunken brawls and looking for prostitutes would have been more interesting.
B00001OH7Y|4.0|Bowie's albums are like a fine wine.  Scary Monsters is a particular vintage which still sounds excellent today.  It's the artistic vintage of Bowie which continues to surprise people like myself.<br />Every new Bowie album in the 70s was a new experience for its listeners - literally.  With the exception of the Ziggy / Alladin Sane period - Bowie's albums from the mid-70s onwards were refreshingly different from one another.  This is no exception.  It's been mentioned in other reviews that Scary Monsters was Bowie's last significant release from a historical perspective.  That's pretty true.  If he'd died after this was released - his legend would've certainly been sealed on a high note.<br />The New wave artists who were about to arrive on the UK scene worshipped Bowie.  Scary Monsters shows why:  Bowie was a law unto himself. <br />Cryptic yet accessible; raw yet melodic - Bowie's lyrics drive this album, as does the great guitar work of Fripp and a cameo by Pete Townshend.  This is a far more sonic work than Bowie's previous albums, and plunges the listener headlong into his inner world.  The iconic tracks here that everyone knows are Ashes to Ashes; Fashion and Scary Monsters.  The lesser known tracks (ie not heard on his compilations) - form the rest of the snapshot.  Scary Monsters is very much like a portrait of Bowie, of which the better known songs are simply parts of his overall psyche.<br />Scary Monsters capped a tremendous musical decade that blew critics and audiences away, and belongs in any Bowie collection.  Many of his ardent fans wish he would or could return to this form -and some believe he has with his 90s releases, but don't believe it...For some reason, Bowie has never sounded as artistically immersed in a one particular work after this one.<br />So get this vintage for its raw passion.  And if you can, do get the rykodisc for the extra tracks which are worth it.

B000002UTY|4.0|The Quicksilver Messenger Service was never as well-known as some other San Francisco bands of the late sixties, but they played first-rate music that was original and inspiring. In my own humble opinion, the band was at its best when vocalist Dino Valente was NOT a participant (i.e., pre-1970), and the first two albums produced by QMS remain among the very best recordings of the legendary \\"San Francisco Sound.\\" <br />\\"Happy Trails,\\" recorded at the Fillmores East and West and released in 1969, represents an (edited) example of the band's very finest live performances; the music sounds fresh and exuberant even after more than thirty years. <br />What was originally the first side of a vinyl lp showcases the Quick's interpretation of Bo Diddley's fabulous \\"Who Do You Love.\\" The result is a fabulous musical journey featuring incredible guitar solos by Gary Duncan and John Cipollina and also by bass player David Freiberg. Drummer Greg Elmore holds the whole piece together not only with his tight and steady rendition of the trademark Bo Diddley beat, but also his ability to provide a solid rhythmic backing to the improvised guitar solos. <br />The long, jazz-tinged solo by Duncan has always particularly impressed me with its inventiveness and structural near-perfection. \\"Who Do You Love\\" also includes a playful interchange between band and audience that leads gloriously into Cipollina's exuberant solo. Overall, this recording represents some of the finest and most memorable music to emerge from the amazing San Franciso rock scene that emerged during the \\"psychedelic era.\\"<br />What was side two of the vinyl album begins with a fine version of another Diddley classic, \\"Mona,\\" and finishes with a fun, campy rendition of the Roy Rogers/Dale Evans theme song, \\"Happy Trails.\\" What comes in between, \\"Maiden of the Cancer Moon\\" and the definitely psychedelic \\"Calvary\\" (complete with spooky Spanish guitar riffs) has its moments, but in all truth represents a somewhat weaker portion of the performance than the breathtaking \\"Who Do You Love.\\" <br />All in all, this recording is absolutely ESSENTIAL for anyone who \\"was there\\" during the glory years of the San Francisco sound, and also for anyone who wasn't but who loves great rock music.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I found the movie adaptation of Harry Potter excellent and the special features excellent.<BR>The best thing I loved from this DVD was the way that you can explore some areas of Hogwarts in real life with a rotating camera and not only that, the storyboards they made for most of the sets like the Quidditch game.<br />The only minor problem with this Dvd is that to find the deleted scenes when you don't know how can be quite difficult.<br />The only thing I can tell is thaht the place where you have to go to find them after getting your wand is to go in the classrooms area and touch the owl statue on the screen and then on the «H» on the pillar.<br />Good luck
B000001EL7|3.0|I don't think that 'Love gun' is even half as good as 'Rock and roll over'.<BR>Like it's predecessor, it has the same producer in Eddie Kramer, and overall the same feel as 'Rock and roll over'. But the end result is bland at best.<BR>There are some stand out moments here, including \\"I stole your love\\", \\"Almost human\\" and \\"Shock me\\". The latter being guitarist Ace Frehley's first lead vocal on a KISS record and is, in my opinion, the best song on the album.<BR>Weaker songs on the album include \\"Tomorrow and tonight\\", \\"Then she kissed me\\", and the much overrated title track.<BR>There isn't much else to speak of with the rest of the album, other than mentioning the top 20 hit \\"Christine Sixteen\\", and the irony of \\"Hooligan\\", which is drummer Peter Criss' second rocker in a row from the band's then ballad singer. (His other rocker being \\"Baby driver\\" from 'RARO').<BR>All in all, as I've mentioned before, this album isn't up to par with 'RARO', but there are some high lights that make it worth the occasion listen or two.
B000020617|4.0|SORRY 4 THE KORNY TITLE, BUT YOU GOT A DAMN GOOD BAND HERE AND AN EVEN BETTER ALBUM. IM NOT TELLING YOU TO BUY IT LIKE EVERY OTHER PERSON WHO REVIEWED THIS. IM TELLING YOU TO RESPECT IT COZ YOU GOT ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MOST EXPIRIENCED ROCK PERSONALITIES ABOUT NOWADAYS - DAVE GROHL. H8 TO SAY THIS BUT, NIRVANA ARE WAY BETTER!, STILL, GOOD ALBUM, V.GOOD ALBUM...
B000002AJZ|5.0|Eccentric beats and tunes. For a twist of the different and eclectic, I highly recommend.
B00005K3OT|2.0|Someone at the office recommended this film as one of the finest she saw so I went there expecting to be enthralled by its beauty.<br /><br />There was beauty all right. But in the wrong place. The power of filmmaking is that one is able to convey the author's view and beliefs and if crafted right, move the audience to that belief system. Witness the power of the Disney's film \\"BAMBI\\" to increase the number of people against hunting innocent animals.No question that it influenced me in that I never hunted animals.<br /><br />The film Chocolat clearly shows the author's bias towards the New Age and Witchcraft in using chocolate. Witchcraft meaning using compounds to trigger sensations and release emotions that normally would not occur. It does show the origin of cacao in the indigenous mesoamerican religion.<br /><br />In a good filmmaking, conflict is an essential part of crafting a story and the object is how the protagonist resolves that conflict.In Chocolat, the conflict is traditional repressive Catholic Christianity vs the New Age and the freedom it represents. The first thing that the newcomer protagonist Juliette Binoche as Vivianne does is to open the chocolate shop and have it be open on Sunday in a very Catholic 1950's French village.That is NOT respecting the local customs and practices and of course that starts a conflict.<br /><br />The list of antagonists reads like everyone that a liberal card carrying ACLU member love to hate...a conservative priest, a conservative religious mayor, a white conservative population, a husband who expects his wife to stay at home...and of course he beats her also.<br /><br />Of course, the conservative priest and the mayor are shown in the film as hypocrites and the freedom loving chocolat artisan Juliette and the gypsies such as Johnny Depp represent the finest humanity has to offer.<br /><br />It was this obvious politically correct scriptwriting that lost my respect for the film.The positive for this film was that I thought the acting was excellent and the location and set exquisite.<br /><br />I do recommend another film that dealt with religious repression and yet it was still respectful of that religion. Babette's Feast to me is a prime example of that film, able to resolve that conflict of releasing the human artistry and feelings amidst a desolate and seemingly repressed faith that allowed no sensual enjoyment for the sake of the religious faith. But yet, there was the respect for that sect by several people who forsook the repressive lifestyle and went on to enjoy the best the world had to offer : fame, fortune, power, the best food in the world ... and after doing all that, realized like the wise King Solomon of Israel and declare, All is vanity, all is vanity !! The French opera singer wrote in a letter that now he is older, he is not longer famous and everyone forgot him. He said maybe that the sisters who stayed in that village and that religious life may have chosen a better path.<br /><br />I highly recommend Babette's Feast over Chocolat any day.was excellent and the location and set exquisite.<BR><br />I do recommend another film that dealt with religious repression and yet it was still respectful of that religion.

0790729725|5.0|This is quiet literally, one of the very few movies I can sit and watch over and over. With a personal viewing figure now standing at well above 50 times.. you can imagine how highly I rate this.<BR>Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are fantastic together. Ray Liotta's character seemed to think living the gangsters life was fantastic, at first.. adn there's no doubt after watching it, that many viewers would agree! However, the bad far outweighs the good, as he soon finds out. I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave it there.<br />If anyone who hasn't seen this before, goes and watches it. I'd be interested to hear your opinions on the movie.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I find myself constantly defending this movie to others, except Jar-Jar of course. And as a lifetime Star Wars fan, somebody who grew up on Star Wars, it is very hard for me to bash this film ...... but I will. I loved the final lightsaber battle, it really saved the movie in my opinion. And the pod racing scene was great. But the whole Gungan thing was a complete waste of time.<br />The similarities between this film (the 1st of 6) to possibly the weakest of the original 3 (Return of the Jedi, 6 of 6) are almost unbelievable. The final climactic scenes include a jedi battle, a land battle between an alien race created for children (Gungans/Ewoks), and a space battle. So you'd think Lucas would learn from his mistakes. Apparently not.<br />A lot of people have had a problem with the technology factor as well. For going so far into the past, the technology really appears to be better. Probably a side affect of the improved special effects.<br />I'd just like to add \\"what ever happened to actors playing parts, and not EVERY character on the screen being a digital creation? If this keeps up, whats the point of even making a movie with actors?<br />...
B00005JCAA|5.0|Each time I watch Martin Brest's masterpiece, \\"Meet Joe Black,\\" I am swept into a different world, and I'm truly happy.  Compliments to Mr. Brest for making such a beautiful motion picture that manages to change my life, spiritually and emotionally, every single time I watch it.  It becomes more and more profound and moving with each viewing.  \\"Meet Joe Black\\" was criminally ignored at the 1999 Academy Awards.  Hello?  At the very least, the nominations should have been the following:  Best Picture, Best Actor (for both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt), Best Supporting Actress (Claire Forlani), Best Director (Martin Brest), Best Original Score (Thomas Newman), Best Cinematography, and Best Adapted Screenplay.  I'm still happy \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" won Best Picture that year, because that, too, is one of my favorite films.  Yet I am still angry \\"Meet Joe Black\\" was so ignored.  It's the picture's fans that make its glory live on.  Not even \\"Moulin Rouge\\" could take my top honors as my favorite film of all time from \\"Meet Joe Black.\\"  And, honestly, no picture in my life time ever will, and that is a guarantee.  There is no better film out there.  \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a celebration of life and love, and the actors fill the characters with such an immense beauty that it is impossible not to love them.  I am a film critic myself, and I don't know how some critics could sit through and praise long, boring movies, where \\"Meet Joe Black\\" is long, but is astonishing in every way.  Is Brest perhaps a little self-indulgent?  Perhaps.  But I say no.  All he did was to take a boring 80-minute flick from decades and decades ago and extend it into a sweeping, enganging, romantic epic about life...about the people we meet, the trials we go through, and the love we share that makes it worth the journey in the end.  The dazzling cinematography shines through in the last act, a poignant series of goodbyes illuminated by breathtaking fireworks and Thomas Newman's lush and haunting score.  \\"Meet Joe Black\\" will remain in my memory until the day I die, and the first time I ever watched it will be the best three hours of my life, for those three hours changed my life in a way nothing has ever before.  I've been touched by \\"Meet Joe Black,\\" as will you be.\\"Meet Joe Black\\" will remain in my memory until the day I die, and the first time I ever watched it will be the best three hours of my life, for those three hours changed my life in a way nothing has ever before.

B00003CXXP|4.0|Oddly affecting, but emotionally muddled. And it takes itself very seriously.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Stop being stupid everyone! This album is cool as hell. Buy it, if you don't have it. And don't listen to the imbeciles giving it 3 stars or less.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Like so many other reviewers, I have to say that I really enjoyed the movie (after all, I watch things to be entertained, not to analyse them).  I should have liked to see the deleted scenes integrated into the movie, rather than stuck in some silly game on the other disk, but what the heck?  There aren't really worth slogging through the rather clunky interface to get to, although the first (movie) disk is worth watching.<br />It doesn't seem to matter whether you've read the books first or not -- my husband hadn't, I had, and we both enjoyed the movie about the same.  I can only suggest that you remember that all fiction requires a *willing suspension of disbelief* and that this is fantasy written for children.  The supporting cast were wonderful, and I think young Radcliffe shows potential.  We adults need to remember that this is aimed at kids, who are usually much less critical about detail than we are.  A nice flick, worth a second (or third or forth) look.
B000060P79|5.0|I've said it before and I'll say it again...Simple Plan kicks [rear]!The cd is totally amazing.I can relate to the songs and I always want to use simple plan's music in school projects.I've have the cd for about a couple months now and I listen to it non-stop!I could never get bored of it. I really recommend that you should get the cd and go to a Simple Plan concert...The musics awesome...the guys are awesome...so why wouldn't you want to?
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid is an awesome band. If you don't have this album yet you better run and get one right now!
B000001ESF|5.0|A true rock classic.<br />Their first triumph as a recording act that opened the doors for their great career.  <br />Artistic, emotional, fresh, powerful and often beautiful; this album contains the song that defines the reason rock music needs to be played LOUD.  It's all found on 2112, and particularly on the 18 minute title track.  <br />If you call yourself a classic rock fan, you need to have this album.
B000059T5O|3.0|I love John Hammond, I love Tom Waits, I even like tribute albums.<BR>I thought this could be the best of both worlds... but it just is not. To attempt an analogy... It's not like peanut butter and chocolate... more like smooth peanut butter and chunky peanut butter... <BR>I think Waits and Hammond admire each other just too much to produce a truly interesting CD.<BR>Maybe Hammond &amp; Sofie Van Otter backed by Kepa Junkera and Eddie Gomez with somebody on a uke and a drum kit of found objects... now THAT would be interesting. Or if you want real blues let Buddy Guy do the same set.<BR>I own the CD and occasionally play it... it just could have been SO MUCH MORE.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I went to see Resident Evil at the movie theaters, and it was GREAT. I'm not just saying this in defense as a fan of the games. The movie truly was the best horror movie since the very first Halloween movie. If you want great action and blood thirsty zombies, (or are just a great fan of the game) you'll want this DVD!
B000006NPY|5.0|I bought Adore about 3 months ago.  At first it was only so-so, but after a short while, I was able to appreciate its sheer grandeur and beauty .  My personal favorites include &quot;To Sheila,&quot; one of Billy's simple yet lovely love songs; &quot;Tear,&quot; which almost brought me to tears with its somber melody and lyrics; &quot;The Tale Of Dusty and Pistol Pete,&quot; which is one of the more upbeat, almost happy songs; &quot;Annie Dog,&quot; with its clever lyricism and simple yet catchy melody; and &quot;For Martha,&quot; one of the most beautiful, sweeping songs I've ever heard.  All in all, one of the least appreciated Pumpkins CDs.  Possibly one of the most beautiful, if not the best, albums of the late 90s.
6302250269|4.0|This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives.  Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films.  Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary.  Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.<br />Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free.  Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end.  The characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clich&eacute;s, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald), Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.<br />I have never seen Geena Davis better.  Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes.  Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise, vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding.  Note, by the way, her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday (&quot;Kiss my grits!&quot;) who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Flo.&quot;<br />Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.<br />This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart.  The male-bashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get.  The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may differ.<br />Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades.  Weasel-like, he is trying to help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice.  &quot;He knows,&quot; she says to Louise and hangs up.<br />Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly, menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon.  Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.<br />I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend.  They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female relationships.<br />See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and never looked better.mething who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.<br />This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart.

1587990717|5.0|If the author feels superior to his peers, it is only because, like Soros, he thinks that he is fallible while they think that they are intelligent and great. It is this attitude that one cannot fail to admire.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This is the only soundtrack of any movie that actually induces emotion.   <br />You don't even need to see the movie to appreciate this music.<br />If you liked the Radiohead tribute album &quot;Strung out on OK Computer&quot; you will love the use of strings.<br />Haunting.
B000002LCX|5.0|For me, this is The SMITHS' finest album & a CLASSIC!!! From the album cover art (a close-up frontal view of Richard Davalos' face) to the 10 catchy, addicting & very very good songs like \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Love Me\\", \\"Paint A Vulgar Picture\\", \\"Girlfriend In A Coma\\" et.al. I'm also obsessed with this album in a way that I've been hoarding CDs (US-Made only) of this title for the last 7 years, I now have 106 pcs. of The SMITHS - Strangeways, Here We Come CD and counting! Obviously, this is my No.1 album of all time - try it to believe it.
B000000H40|4.0|Cause of Death remains Obituary's finest work. While it is not a real straightforward album like Back from the Dead, it is chock full of great songs with amazing leadwork by James Murphy.  It is definately James' ultra smoothe leads that puts this album above most Death metal albums. Obituary's sound is a bit slow, holding out chords. Vocals are raspy, as opposed to deep and glutteral. Similar to Death. Great band to check out if you want to get into death metal, but do not want to hear 45 minuites of straight blast beats. Album could use a lyric sheet though. At times, I am not sure if lyrics have been written, or if he is just making sounds. This can leave the music one dimensional. Overall, an essential   Death metal album. Highlights include Chopped in Half, and Circle of the Tyrants. I met James Murphy before he went for his operation and he was the coolest, most personable rocker I have met. Get well.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The first time I saw &quot;HARRY POTTER&quot; I liked it, the effects were great, the acting I guess was O.K., the score was great too, but what bothered me was that it seemed to be a more childish and simpler than the original book. The original book could be likable for all agaes(supposedly), but the movie can't. One disapointment in the movie was that the scary parts were scarier written down in the book than to be actually seen in the movie. And anyone over 12 years old wouldn't likely be caught laughing at the &quot;supposed to be funny&quot; scenes. Even though the special features should be interesting, I would reccomend renting it first befor you run off to your nearest movie store and buying it and not know what your getting.
0440224764|4.0|This is a real good story with a very developed plot, and very interesting in my opinion, but a bit slower read and not as much suspense, in my opinion. I liked this book a lot but thought the ending could've been better.
6304469519|5.0|It is excellent! The music of this opera is awesome and singers like Pavarotti make it even better. If you like Verdi or Pavarotti that's exactly what you want.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had read the book and was quite pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was.  Yes, it left out things that it would have been nice to see but a movie can only be so long.  I was quite impressed by the actors, especially the kids.  They looked just like I pictured them.  The sets and costumes were great.  I can't wait for future movies.

038533558X|5.0|I am really not a reader of suspense thrillers, but I failed to notify my book club not to deliver this selection, so walla it arrived on my doorstep.  I normally just send the books back when this occurs, but I was hard up for some fiction, so I decided to give it a try.  This was a fateful decision I have definately not come to regret...once I started this book I could not put it down!  It is easily the best book I have read in at least 2 years.  <BR>  The storyline was awesome, the dialogue was smart, the characters were great (I especially liked Squares).  Lots of twists and turns, without being predictable or sophmoric.  If this novel is really indicative of Harlan Coben's writing style, I hope to be enjoying his other books soon.
B00003CXI0|4.0|It is really dissapointing that this movie does not contain the second Quiditch match against Hufflepuff and misses a lot of other elements of the book, but the movie is very beautiful and interesting.
B00002E233|3.0|Of all the movies that Renny Harlin has directed, this one [stinks] the least.  I hope Harlin realizes that that is a compliment.<br />If Spielberg had 1999's digital technology at his fingertips when making JAWS in 1974-75, then JAWS probably would not have been anywhere near as good as it is.  Speilberg would have shown way too much of the shark, and way too soon in the film, as was his original plan anyway before it went awry thanks to the constantly malfunctioning mechanical albatross of a shark (three of them, actually) he had to work with.<br />  With DEEP BLUE SEA, Harlin is so gung-ho on letting us see what mechanical marvels his fake sharks are and what digital tricks he can pull, he forgot the less-is-more rule.  And as with every other Harlin film, the directing is clunky, forced, and obvious.  There is very little style or grace to it.  The genetically enhanced mako sharks in his movie could have been made to be more terrifying than anything seen in JAWS, but instead he endows them with a cartoonish physicality.<br />A better director (and one who might not come off as being so high on himself in the accompanying audio commentary) could have made DEEP BLUE SEA a decent balance of thrill-ride and haunted house scare, all rooted in a sufficient amount of plausibility.  Harlin, however, directs his movies like a kid wielding a very expensive Hollywood magic wand.  His films are like a series of expensive set-pieces strung together with nary a thought for the intelligence of the audience or for even the thinnest sense of reality his audience must buy into to be completely sold on the film's concept.<br />But DEEP BLUE SEA is about as good a movie as Renny Harlin will ever make.  But the raw materials of this film most certainly would have been assembled much more effectively by a more accomplished and talented director.
B00003CX95|5.0|5 star action, 5 star acting, and a 5 star storyline and plot. What more could you ask for? How about:<BR>5 ACADEMY AWARDS:<br />Best Picture<BR>Best Director: Mel Gibson<BR>Best Cinematography<BR>Best Makeup<BR>Best Sound Effects Editing<br />   INTERESTING: I was shocked to see that &quot;BRAVEHEART&quot; didn't win an acting award, nor did it get a nomination. This is absurd, Mel Gibson undoubtingly proved himself by giving the performance of his career. Also, the plot and storyline should have won an award.<BR>   A BIT OF ADVICE: some people haven't seen this movie, and want to, but don't like watching brutal medieval warfare in gruesome detail. I wouldn't reccomend this to you if all this is true on your part, and if you try to skip these war scenes then you might as well skip the movie or you'll be the only one who's seen the movie, but doesn't know what it's about.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Critics don't even think about badmouthing the best cd ever.<br />1) 742617000027- This intro contains excerpts from the Charlie Manson interview. Doesn't that rock?!<br />2) (SIC)- The Molt-Injected Mix on the 'Wait and Bleed' cd is good too so check that out.<br />3) Eyeless- I heard Slipknot got the lyrics from a mentally-disordered guy in New York who was screaming, \\"You can't see California without Marlin Brando's eyes\\".<br />4) Wait and Bleed- Corey's singing is so good and so is Sid's DJ-ing in this song.<br />5) Surfacing- This is our National Anthem so don't you ever degrade it.<br />6) Spit it Out- Wow, Corey's good at tongue twisters and he can amazingly sing at the same time! This song is so great and they made a music video to go with it which you can see on the 'Welcome to our Neighborhood\\" video. The video's based on the movie 'The Shining' and MTV banned it because of the violent baseball-bat scene between Corey and James.<br />7) Tattered & Torn- 'If you understand this song, then you understand the Clown' [ Shawn, creator of the song]<br />8) Me In Side- The spanish Corey sings is in regard to a spanish speaking member of Slipknot.<br />9) Liberate- A great song, also the live version is cool, available on the 'Left Behind' cd, which features the Left Behind Director's cut music video which you can see on the computer.<br />10) Prosthetics- This song is based on some movie they watched where a killer couldn't help himself but take this girl home with him and kill her. (apparently)<br />11) No Life- This song rules! You really have no life when you don't have freedom and everyone = s*** in this world.<br />12)Diluted- Great song that speaks for us all who had to undeservingly pay for something we never did.<br />13) Only One- The talk-singing parts in this song make it cool and the part where everyone screams 'only one of us walks away'  totally rules.<br />14) Scissors- Joey Jordison wrote this song and its good especially towards the end when Corey goes nuts and screams till he gags.<br />15*) Guys, there's a hidden track if you keep track no. 14 on until about 13 minutes and 25 seconds.

B00003CXI1|3.0|Great movie, even though it left out a excessive amount of scenes and dialog.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I heard it for the first time in fabled Chicago.  Jeff Tweedy sounds like an anemic Ray Davies.  This is one of those records you think you have to buy and then when you get it home you're vaguely angry at yourself for being taken in. I bought it up in New York at a record store in Times Square, along with an old Sergio Mendes album that contains some non-descript but fun versions of songs done better by the Beatles and Elis Regina. Anyway, &quot;Yankee Foxtrot Hotel&quot; not bad at all but very, very boring and Jeff Tweedy's voice non-descript in an annoying way.  Some good songs here and some pretty awful words, America and Its Loneliness and all.  The sonic trickery and goop reminds me of the third Big Star record but &quot;Hotel Yankee Foxtrot&quot; lacks the passion and the craziness of that landmark recording.  I play &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and it don't sound bad in the changer along with that other &quot;Foxtrot&quot; from Genesis which isn't all that good in the changer since &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; clocks in at about half an hour and annoys my guests who expect a changer to change a lot, but I'm from the south and I need a bit more rhythm that what this here offers.  Maybe Jeff Tweedy can go to Haiti next, or Madagascar, or even Shreveport where he could re-create the sound of the Louisiana Hayride.  Music from Chicago:  stick to Tortoise I guess and I hear there are some good free-jazz guys up there too.
B00004R997|1.0|This is bottom of the barrel Disney. A 42-minute puff piece for Latin America, it contains only four animated sequences, only two of which (\\"Lake Titicaca\\" & \\"El Gaucho Goofy\\") are moderately entertaining. The rest is dreadful, live-action travelogue fodder, the kind of thing you sat through in elementary school assemblies back in the 1950s. There's another endless live-action short about Disney's crew gathering local color (which has to be added to the so called \\"feature\\" to get the 75 minute running time on the box info). Both of these films should have been added as bonuses to THE THREE CABALLEROS disc. Though the Disney completists may drool over this long-lost film finally being released, kids and most adults will find most of it painful to sit through. A snore.

1563896656|5.0|This is easily one of the greatest comic series to have come out in years.  Moore's careful attention to detail and brilliant writing style, continues to breathe new life into the age old superhero genre (including enough obscure Victorian literary references to keep readers engaged for hours).  Moore proves that comic books can combine intelligence with incredible action (plus healthy doses of 'Steampunk'), without relying on the same old tired cliches.  I cannot recommend this series enough, my only major complaint is that as far as I can tell a follow up series is still sometime away (Moore is otherwise engaged with Americas Best Comics), but it seems likely from the conclusion that the 'League' might be dealing with an intersteller problem (H.G Wells \\"War of the Worlds\\" perhaps?) I also found O'Neill's style of art to mesh extremely well with Moores writing, I can't wait to see what these two come up with next. The series has also been opted as a movie (according to Aint-It-Cool-News.com and the Internet Movie Database) with Sean Connery playing the role of Quartermain. If the script lives up to Moore and O'Neill's vision (something lacking in another Moore movie adaptation 'From Hell') I know I will definetly be in line. If you are a comics fan at all, or just want a interesting ... read, pick this book up now!!!!
6304342160|5.0|The exceptional performances by Gershon, Tilly, and Joe Pantolano are not the only reason to like this film. It is beautifully shot and in fact had some of the most interesting cinematography of any film of the year. In fact, what I liked most about the movie wasn't the story or the acting, both of which were excellent. It was the occasionally interesting and unusual camera shot--the drink being poured into a tumbler from so close up you couldn't tell for a moment what it was, and the scene with all the money hanging from clothespins in the apartment, both of which were done with an eye for the poetic and even surrealistic.<br />The director obviously put a lot of thought into shooting some of these scenes, and on a technical note I'd be curious to know what kind of movie-camera lens they were using on that close-up shot of the bottom of the whiskey glass--motion picture camera lenses tend to be wide-angles--and they would need to go to a shorter focus lens for such a shot. (Also, you wouldn't believe a typical large movie camera lens costs. I have been told they can run into the hundred of thousands of dollars). Anyway, overall this was a visually very appealing and well done movie. I hope we see more of them from this director (who, if I remember right, went on to do the movie, Matrix).
B00003CXZ1|5.0|What's so wrong with this movie? I thought it was good. People just don't want to appreciate it for what it is. Angelina Jolie was perfect as our leading lady Lara Croft. So, here's my advice: Don't pay any attention to those 1, 2 or 3 star reviewers and see this movie. You may like it.

B000066NW0|5.0|When I saw the video for Complicated on MTV I knew that Avril Lavigne had what it takes to be a hugely popular artist. Her lyrics are amazing, the music is great, and she has her own look and style: Skater Girl. I don't think anyone has seen that yet and it's about time. When listening to the album you can find similarities with many different artists, but it's all meshed together in to one unique style. <br />What sets Avril apart from most of the young female singers out today is that all her songs have a message that comes across very clearly. She feels what she's singing and you can tell. I know alot of people can relate her songs to experiences they've had in their own lives and relationships, with people being fake, being rejected, and thinking something but never saying it. These are just a few. The album isn't upbeat pop and it's not angst ridden with a jaded view of the world. It's honest. That alone will carry Avril Lavigne through an amazing career. She is definitely one of the artists I can see still being around 10 years from now.
6302732875|5.0|Originally written for the stage, Glengarry Glen Ross was adapted for the screen by David Mamet himself, and the results are nothing short of electrifying.  While there is nothing flashy about the sets, cinematography, or score to this film, the film still burns with intensity, which is a credit to Mamet's sharp, almost rhythmic dialogue, as well as the performances of a powerhouse cast assembled for the film.  Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino are standouts in the film, both delivering nuanced performances that are aguably the best of their careers.<br />Though the subject matter of the film may seem dull by description, this film is anything but dull.  This modern masterpiece is a wonderful character study on the actions that desperate men take in desperate times, and is one of the most gripping dramas ever filmed.<br />Let's hope this film gets its DVD treatment sometime soon.
6304779356|5.0|While this movie is nothing short from amazing, Dolan Debattista (a previous reviewer) is completely wrong about the Sisters of Mercy having anything to do with the title song &quot;Cry Little Sister&quot;. I don't know how these crazy rumors get started that song was both written and performed by Gerald McMann.
0553212737|5.0|i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool.  the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now.  Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions.  though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book.  i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then.  it's amusing, witty, and shocking.  really great book.
0425170349|2.0|This is by far the worst Clancy book that I have read. The last 50 pages were the worst. Beside his deep hatred for environmentalists, Clancy showed the world that he has no clue on what rich and educated folks would do when they have committed a crime. The ending of this book is just unbelievably bad.
B00004XQP4|3.0|I think Green Day is great, but this album is not as good as their past albums, if your a beginner at listening to green day, this is a good starter album, but the old albums were much better than this one.  I know billie Joe can still sing well because i just heard him two days ago, and i think he should start writing like the style he did with the old albums.
6300215741|4.0|Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, the two most glamorous stars of the 50's star in this beautiful piece of fluff about jewel thefts on the French Riviera. Grant is a reformed thief that is suspected of un-reforming, and Kelly is a rich American travelling with her mother (Jessie Royce Landis, Grant's mother in \\"North by Northwest\\") who catches the eye of Grant.    The movie has one of unintentionally funniest moments in movie history. Walking on the grounds of a fabulous villa, Grant says to Kelly, \\"Why don't you own a place like this?\\" Her reply is, \\"Palaces are for royalty. We're just common people with a bank account.\\" (This from, of course, the soon to be Princess of Monaco.) The DVD restoration was a definite improvement over the washed out VHS version, but they didn't do quite the restoration job that Vertigo got. This movie isn't one of Hitchcock's great films, but it is the assured work of a master (with a cast to die for), so it's nice to see it looking better.
6303471714|5.0|Apart from Cindy Crawford's  \\"New Dimension\\",  this one is a vigorous workout! Included with two separate 45-minute sessions is a 10 minute session for those days when you are in a hurry.<br />RADU the fitness trainer is considered New York's toughest trainer. He has worked with models, actors and executives.  Shots include the beautiful beach, rooftop, workout room<br />MUSICAL CHOICE is not the usual instrumental used in most videos; her choice is similar to her other video. Credits of musical selections are listed at the end, most songs performed by Primal Scream, Seal contributes \\"Crazy\\", \\"Ice\\" by Daniel Lanois, \\"State of Shock\\" Revenge and \\"Dis Moi Dis Moi\\" by Mitsou.  It's unique and refreshing.<br />ALTERNATE DAYS - The video is incorporated to do on alternate days. The nearly 100 minute tape is structured in two separate workouts. Workout I- 45 minutes is focused on leg work, use a chair, swing the legs this way, that way, back, front, etc. This \\"legwork\\" isn't usually done in most other workout experts, but it is very effective. She then continues a vigorous workout with buns, abs, chest (with small weights). Workout II is similar with concentration to the arms and shoulders, and more abdominal work.<br />MINI WORKOUT - 10 minutes. This is done to get a real quick workout when time is essential. This is a challenging workout! I recommend it to anyone. It isn't difficult, it is just about getting to do it to make it easier! .......MzRizz.
0385503954|2.0|I enjoyed &quot;Amsterdam,&quot; McEwan's Booker Prize-winning novel.  I thought it was a clever (albeit slick) little jewel of a book.  Hearing that &quot;Atonement&quot; was his masterpiece, I knew I had to read it.  Frankly, I found it a dull book about dull people.  To be perfectly honest, after starting to skim it halfway through,I never finished it.  As social comedy (or commentary) it can't hold a candle to anything by Anthony Powell or Evelyn Waugh.  Masterpiece or not, I thought it a bore and a major disappointment.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I don't think it's hard to understand at all. It's a very interesting story told in a very interesting way. The result is very entertaining. I just love it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie. I loved it mostly because I love musicals, but also the story was amazing. Moulin Rouge is about a romantic writer trying to find his big break and gets caught up in a whirl wind of events that bring him to the door step and heart of a woman who &quot;works&quot; for her money. The costumes are beautiful and the choreography is stunning. I found myself getting swept into the bohemian time period. I was wishing I could have been in &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot; the play that they perform. This dvd is excellent! The special features are wonderful especially the Lady Marmalade video and performance. I high recommend this dvd because of the quality and the brilliance that is Moulin Rouge.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD was spectacular! I purchased this for myself and months later for a Mothers Day present for my mother. She was thrilled. She said that this is her favorite CD of the day.<br />The music on this CD will take you back to a time when thoughts and emotions where expressed through music. Bards of old, come to life and give the listener a feeling of comfort and empathy. Modern music can't compare with music that told a story of life.
6304602979|5.0|This movie didnt get the proper respect that it has deserved over the years. This is one of Tarantino's best, second of course to Pulp Fiction. This movie is about an Elvis obsessed comic book store worker played by Christian Slater, who falls head over heels with a call girl played by Patricia Arquette. But the path to true romance is never smooth. On their journey to bliss they get involved and unknowingly screw up a drug deal and now have to get rid of the stuff before the mob boss played by Christopher Walken, catches up to them. All in all this movie is filled with action and humorous parts. Brad Pitt does an excellent job as the stoner roommate of Slater's friend in California. This movie is great and I recommend it to any Tarantino fan.

0553106635|5.0|I have just finished reading A Storm of Swords (And the other two books in the series) for the second time and I must say it is a awesome addition to this groundbreaking series. This book is the turning point of the series. All of the characters are where they need to be in order to meet the oncoming Winter.<br /> The War of the Five Kings is winding down to a conclusion, and the much greater threat that looms from beyond the wall has finally been recognized by one of the Five Kings. Martin keeps with the tradition of boldy killing off main characters and including huge twists and turns in his lively, descriptive writing.<br />With this book the fact that the Song of Ice and Fire is destined to be one of the best epic fantasy series' ever written is apparent. This is GOOD storytelling. <br />The Wheel of Time is trudging along in boring-land,with little or no progress in some of the latest additions (Though I do see a hint of flickering hope in the end of the Winter's Heart and the upcoming Crossroads of Twilight) while the Sword of Truth seems to be taking the same course as the Wheel of Time at this point, going nowhere fast. <br />If you want a series whose turning point is at book 3 as opposed to book 10, a series that is moving along like a speeding train screaming toward a awe-inspiring and gripping conclusion, then jump onto the Martin bagwagon and discover what good fantasy writing is.
B00006690F|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that it took a while for me to catch on to Eminem.  When I first heard his \\"Slim Shady LP\\", I thought it was good for some laughs but was hard to take seriously.  When the \\"Marshall Matthers LP\\" came out I felt otherwise.  I had heard Eminem on a few tracks off of Dr. Dre's \\"Chronic 2001\\" and the \\"Matthers LP\\" and I heard frustration and humor that puts a lot of rap artists to shame.  He's a rare talent that isn't afraid to take shots at people.  His lyrics are shocking and filled to the brim with four letter words but he puts his heart into his music I believe.  I can't say I approve of everything he says or would support parents buying his albums for young children but on his latest CD, he is in top form.<BR>    \\"The Eminem Show\\" has some of the best music Eminem has ever recorded.  \\"Without Me\\" is the single that is being pushed on the radio and MTV but that song is sandwitched in between songs with much deeper and personal lyrics.  \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" finds Eminem at his most reflective and I can't imagine he'll ever do a song that tops it.  Dr. Dre (producer) samples lyrics and music from Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\" on \\"Sing for the Moment\\".  I can see the two groups on stage now performing this track.   Many guests such as Dre and D-12 (a group of rappers that Eminem produced on their first album, \\"Devil's Night\\") make vocal appearances.  <BR>    I think Eminem has managed to make more enemies than friends over the last few years but he comes out on top in the end, like it or not.  I do not agree with a lot that he has to say sometimes, but to not recognize his talent and his creativity isn't fair.  He turns frustration into art and not everyone can do that.  With his deep lyrics and Dr. Dre's solid production, \\"The Eminem Show\\" is a five star record and Eminem's finest to date.
B000065U1N|5.0|While this movie was indeed a great war picture, it is important to understand the backdrop of how we got their. Our involvement may have started under GH Bush...but at that time it was a US-led international relief effort.  While both presidents did want to scale down American involvement, Cinton made the mistake of turning over American involvement to the UN...under UNOSOM II.  This new UN-led role expanded the original mandate from a &quot;relief&quot; effort to a &quot;nation building&quot; effort.  From that point on, US troops were basically under the control of UN decisions as Clinton acquiesed (sp) his role as Commander and Chief.  This didn't mean that he couldn't unilaterally do what he thought was best for US troops...he just chose not to.  This was evident when requests for heavy vehicle support was also denied so we wouldn't &quot;appear&quot; aggressive.  If you're going to put US soldiers in harms way, you have to give them every means to defend themselves...regardless of appearances. And that is where Clinton and Aspin were wrong.
0061002593|4.0|This is not one of my favorite Heyers, perhaps because I don't feel much for the main couple in the story (but with Heyer, it's almost always this way with me- I usually prefer the supporting cast, so to speak). However, it IS one of her most 'artistically perfect' books, so to speak, with a well-integrated plot that rarely seems to rush unnecessarily, and it's a very good read overall. Damerel is just another Heyer Rochester-like dissipated, impetuous, masterful hero, but he's handled more realistically, perhaps. I never warmed up to either him or Venetia, though. The best character of the book is, in my opinion, Aubrey, Venetia's sickly, sarcastic, scholarly brother, who is endearing for all his faults (not despite of them). Overall, satisfactory in the best of Heyer style.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus has released yet another astonishing album. They never cease to amaze me with their lyrical ingenious and song-to-song diversity. &quot;Morning View&quot; shows a lot of growth as Incubus leaves behind their more hectic music, replacing it with a more melodic sound.(Don't get me wrong, all of their albums are great)<BR>Incubus has an unrivaled, unique sound, and each member adds a great deal of interest to the group; from Brandon's insightful lyrics to Kilmore's groundbreaking turntable skills.<br />It is almost impossible to not relate to what these guys are saying in their work. They have an exceptional way of putting things into words and putting those words to music.<BR>I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys quality music at its best.
B00006690F|4.0|I liked all but 2 songs on this cd, those being Drips and When The Music Stops...and the only reason I didnt like those were becuase of the guest rappers on them...Everything else on the cd I really enjoyed...my favorites would have to be White America, Cleaning Out My Closet, and Sing For The Moment...it's alot darker than his other stuff, and alot of it reminds me of the song Marshall Mathers...so if you like eminem I would suggest you buy this cd...that's all I have to say.
0790729652|5.0|The best comic book film to date. Tim Burton's unique visual display will leave you breathless. In a time of crime, Gotham City is in the need of a superhero. Batman, or the Dark Knight, scares criminals and delivers justice to the city. Jack Napier, a man who is cheating with his boss' girlfriend is about to be wasted, but falls into a chemical tank instead. After that, he becomes the Joker (played by the immortal Jack Nicholson) and vows to get revenge on Batman, the man who dropped him into the pool of chemicals. Batman's personal life revolves around Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger), an aggressive photographer who is on a mission to discover the roots of the Batman. The man behind the mask is none other than the richest man in Gotham City, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton). He is traumatized by his parents' deaths and vows to get revenge on the man who murdered them. He waited for many years to get his hands on Jack Napier, or the Joker. Boy oh boy, does he get revenge! This movie is filled with comic relief from Jack Nicholson with his art altercation in the museum, 'love that Joker' commercials, and huge revolver. Michael Keaton is perfect as the mysterious, but tough Batman and Kim Basinger is too cool as his love interest. &quot;You wanna get nuts!? Let's get nuts!&quot; Listen for the soundtrack with its great orchestration and Prince songs! This movie is the coolest comic book film ever and will forever remain the best. The closing scene where Batman is on a rooftop of a building looking up at his signal is just the best. I can't stress that enough. This movie is pure immortal.
B00005JKED|3.0|I like action police movies, but this one rings of overstated, overdone screenplay from the beginning.  Washington and Hawke are good, but once again nowhere near the hype.  The violent finale is so absurd!  And when the main elements of the plot are revealed it is also absurd.  We can stretch our imaginations to a certain degree, but this is clearly a screenplay and not anywhere close to something realistic.  As far as the academy award goes, I'm completely disgusted by the best actor award.  Denzel is good (as he usually is) but his performance isn't even in the same class as the one by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.  A Beautiful Mind wins all the main awards based upon Crowe's incredible, driven performance and he doesn't win best actor?  We know the academy likes Denzel and doesn't care for Crowe's antics, we know there was an incredible campaign to get Denzel the award, we know there was all that criticism that A beautiful Mind left out shady elements of the main character's life, but did the voters actually think about the 2 performances solely on merit?  Crowe's performance will be heralded for a long time to come, while Denzel's award will be seen as a make-up academy award (like Newman in The Color of Money).  I don't understand the make-up award factor since I looked back at the past times he was nominated and I'm not sure he should have won one, except for the supporting actor award in Glory.  Ultimately Denzel gives a good (not great) performance in a very forgettable, unrealistic movie.  When you see the performances 10 years from now, what will you think?  Academy voters, you are a disgrace.
078322799X|5.0|Before there was \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" there was \\"The Frighteners.\\" Peter Jackson's under-rated supernatural black comedy. The movie stars Michael J. Fox (in his best performance since \\"Back to the Future\\") as Frank Bannister, a troubled man who can see things normal people can't see. A para-normal psychologist of sorts, Frank has just seen something new he has never seen before. After corrupting people for money by using his ghost friends, Frank stumbled upon a different problem. Numbers engraved into people's foreheads were a sign of death coming. The figure in the black cloak couldn't be stopped and it was going to get the woman Frank was falling in love with. In his past, Frank's wife had been murdered and she had a number carved into her face. Vomit time! And it was happening all over again with the supernatural world. Frank's ghoulie friends were destroyed again and a sneaky, foolish agent man was getting in Frank's way. The movie is fast and is extremely fun. You may not like the subject matter, but Michael J. Fox is great. The special effects are cool and Peter Jackson did a great job of directing. Forget the \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" it's all about the reaper. \\"Don't fear the reaper, c'mon baby!\\"
B00003CXE7|2.0|This movie was completely boring all the way through until the big fight scene(which is the only reason this gets two stars).
B00005JKJA|4.0|I could not wait for this to come out on DVD!  Be advised, I am writing this review after only ONE viewing... I think that is the fair way to go about it.<br />First of all, DVD quality:  Picture - 3.0, Sound - 4.0.  <br />I cannot believe that a new film would not have a better picture unless it was filmed to look dirty and grainy.  The sound is pretty good.  Most of the soundtrack is classic David Lynch low rumbling and machinery-type noises.  If you have good bass speakers, you will hear this throughout.  I enjoyed the effect as it brought to mind &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;.  Low background sounds were not used constantly in &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; -- so in this movie it might become irritating to some.  Just viewing on a normal TV you will probably not hear anything besides the dialogue and music.  Music is used with humor.  <br />NOTICE:  This DVD comes with two separate covers!  The more popular cover depicts Laura Harring as a blonde but it contains an insert with the Naomi Watts picture.  The other DVD case cover is Naomi Watts with, hopefully, the Laura Harring photo.  I deliberated in the store for quite a while and opted to buy the popular cover, so I was relieved to find the Watts picture within.<br />ALSO:  For whatever reason, this DVD is one long, 147-minute single chapter.  If you like flicking around, you won't be able to do it.  My DVD software players can search and go to time indexes, so when I took a break and came back to the movie I just had to drag the index to the approximate time where I left off.  Make sure that you can do this otherwise you'll be stuck watching from beginning to end.<br />Usually I do not comment on plot points or acting and prefer to write about the technical aspects of the DVD.  That said, if you are a David Lynch fan you will love this movie.  I don't think the movie &quot;gets inside my head and stays there&quot; as written by Vogue.  I know I will view it several times in the immediate future.  There are two love scenesin the movie that far-and-away are my favorite parts.  Naomi Watts is very pert and energetic, plus good-looking as a petite female.  Harring is a much larger woman so it is extremely sensual to see Watts submit to her, if you interpret it that way. <br />Included on the insert are 10 clues to help viewing this movie.  I ignored them for my first viewing and will eventually get around to employing them for subsequent viewings.  Indeed, searching for or noticing these clues brings a very intellectual element to watching &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot;.<br />Oh, there's plenty of strange things happening to keep your mind busy anyway.  Enjoy!
B0000636UN|4.0|Before I bought this CD, I hadn't listened to anything by Sheryl Crow in 5 years.  I have no idea what compelled me to buy this CD - I'm sure there is a victory for the advertising industry in there somewhere.<br />At first, I was surprised - the first 3 tracks really leapt out of the speakers.  \\"Steve McQueen\\", \\"Soak up the Sun\\", and \\"You're an Original\\" all had me very happy.  Sheryl was extroverted, being satirical with her lyrics.  She has a big problem with the current pop situation, if my take on things are correct.  But still, it's a lot of fun to listen to.<br />Then the middle tracks - 4,5,6 - hit me squarely in the solar plexis.  \\"Safe and Sound\\", \\"C'mon C'mon\\", and the absolutely horrid \\"It's So Easy (Duet with Don Henley)\\" made me fear the remaining tracks.  A stark contrast to the previous 3 tracks, this wallowing in her self-inflicted misery made me want to recommend her a good therapist.<br />\\"Over You\\" gets a bit better, showing a bit of her spite coming back (Spite for Sheryl Crow is a good thing, at least how I'm using the word)  \\"Lucky Kid\\" gets the CD officially back on track.<br />\\"Diamond Road\\" , \\"It's Only Love\\", \\"Abilene\\", and \\"Hole in my Pocket\\" flow out, if not a bit laboured in sections.  \\"Hole in my Pocket\\" went on a bit long for my tastes, and \\"It's Only Love\\" sounded a bit cliche lyrically speaking, and drug its feet through the simple message.<br />The CD closes with a downer \\"Weather Channel (Duet with Emmylou Harris)\\" - and I think this may be the best song on the album lyrically.  The lone guitar is solemnly played, as if it is a 3rd vocalist on the track.<br />Overall, I like this CD, but always skip tracks 4,5 and 6 without a second thought.  10 of the tracks are good, and of those 10, 5 stand out as really good songs.
B00002E23E|4.0|If you consider that Led Zeppelin is the band that gave Spinal Tap 95% of its material and is responsible for just about every rock and roll cliche in the book (from waving lighters at concerts to insanely kinky groupie encounters) you would not expect their only concert film to be anything less than a self-indulgent, kitschy opus. <BR>THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME is al that and more. Watch Jimmy Page play a medieval wizard! Watch their burly tour manager in a mini ganster film! Watch Robert Plant play the noble knight! Watch Bonzo racing cars! See the HOUSES OF THE HOLY album sleeve come to life!<BR>It also contains one of the most mindblowing renditions of \\"Moby Dick\\" I have ever heard. WARNING: Haters of drum solos keep your finger. on the forward button. Standards such as \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" will peel the paint off your walls too. And if you can still stand the song, there is an incredible rendition of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" topped only by the one they played at their \\"reunion\\" concert in 1980. <br />Does anybody remember laughter?<br />Addenda: If you missed Plant live summer 2002, you should get this album!
B0000636UN|1.0|I've been a longtime fan of Sheryl Crow.....but this CD is much like her very first demo album (which was never released, but can be found in bootleg and online)---it is hackneyed mainstream pop. There's no lyrical or musical complexity here. It might be a little catchy in places, but it seems that Crow is just aching for a \\"hit\\".....not art. I was so happy to hear she had a new album out, and really bummed when I heard it. I think this will win her some fans that hated her last few albums (and maybe loved \\"All I Wanna Do.\\" But the truth is, this just doesn't seem like the \\"real\\" Sheryl Crow......it's just mainstream pandering. At least I hope that's all it is.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Kudos to the greatest heavy metal band of all time for giving yet another stellar live performance.  A 2 disc set, featuring a mix that no one thought possible: Heavy metal fused with an orchestra.  Who knew?  Metallica knew.  Alot of their older, heavier stuff already had elements of classical music, so it wasn't hard to mix the two.  The late bassist Cliff Burton brought the classical influence into the band, he was a fan of classical music, thus it influenced his musical direction and played a big part in the thrashing metal of the first three Metallica albums.  (I bet not many people knew that)  A very comprehensive set, they cover material from every album except for the first album \\"Kill Em All\\".  There are 2 new tracks: 'No Leaf Clover' and 'Human', one of them was written by James and the other by Lars.  After the intro 'The Ecstasy of Gold', played by the S.F. orchestra, Metallica fades right into  the classic instrumental,'The Call Of Ktulu'.  Next is 'Master Of Puppets' the classic that is just vintage Metallica.  From then on this album just keeps on rockin'.  'Battery', the classic metal anthem closes out the album with a massive bang, played at about Mach 5 speed.  It's hard to say what my fav tracks are, because all of 'em are great.  If I had to pick a few, I'm very partial to 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', 'Battery', 'One', and 'Wherever I May Roam'.  If you say that Metallica 'sold out', then you are not a true fan.  If anything, this album is a throw back to their older music,(\\"Lightning\\" and \\"Puppets\\") because that music was one of the things that inspired the band to do this  album,(James Hetfield said so in an interview that I read a few years ago when this album was released).  This album rocks, and so does this band.  That's all the verdict you need.  ROCK ON!
B000002G0P|5.0|This is possibly the best all around rock album I own. It's sheer perfection. And what makes it work is the way the whole album comes together. Some -- in fact most -- of these songs wouldn't work in another context, necessarily. Here, every single piece builds on the previous one, comes together in an amazing crescendo of fabulous orchestration. Each section has an overarching mood, and the individual songs go through neat shifts, too. A song will start quiet, then really kick it up, and cool down again, or vice versa. The guitar work is phenomenal, and the lyricism is extraordinary. The vocals aren't always quite up to the standards of the rest of it, and yet they don't detract, either. This is a truly unique listening experience that everyone should experience.
B000002G7E|5.0|Hearing this album for the first time makes you feel very uncomfortable . Shouldnt it ? After all this is the same band that released &quot;Nico and the velvet underpants&quot; which had a German blonde messing up some of the finest songs written by Reed. Maybe the Velvets did this album as some sort of a retribution. And its brilliant and cathartic. Reed , Cale and Sterling go on a journey  of music mayhem here.  The sonic assault unleashed here is almost a blueprint for grunge. The lyrics are angsty , the music is chaotic and full of feedback. Lou reed shines on the vocals singing every ditty with derision and incontinence , unleashing a fury that makes your ears and your heart burn.This album is not just unlike the other three velvet underground albums , its unlike anything on this planet.
6305127646|3.0|I liked this movie much more than I expected.  It is full of action and twists and turns, with good villians and desirable actors.  I must be the only person to think that Elizabeth Shue, playing a ditzy blonde nuclear scientist, succesfully acts a very bright person in the new situation of being in love and being shot at.  I gradually got to like Val Kilmer who seems arrogant at first.  Most movies don't make me look up from my computer; this one made me SIT DOWN and watch it!! True, Val is not much like the Saint - but I never got into that character; didn't like the books and hated Roger Moore anyway.  The chief gunslinger in this is max fun.  Oh, and did I mention Elizabeth Shue?
0380789019|5.0|This is the second book of Neil Gaiman's I've read and it is my favorite so far.  Set in modern London, our hero, Richard Mayhew, is an extremely ordinary nice guy, engaged to an extremely self-centered beauty.  On their way out one evening, he stumbles (literally) over a young woman (Door) who needs help.  Despite his fiancee's threats and whines, Richard does -- as one suspects he always does -- the right thing.<br />The &quot;right thing&quot; leads into an exciting adventure in the underworld of London that satisfies most of my needs to escape my own ordinary life.  There are subway cars that host small earldoms, alleys with the addition of underground hide-outs unseen by any but those who belong, a good bad guy, a bad good guy, some fairly mild struggles, lots of dry humor, no distracting romance, and wonderful characters.<br />Two elderly but very mean bad guys manage to be amusing in their dreadful conversations (in between doing what they love to do most -- torture, maim and eliminate those who are on their list or in their way.)  The toughest 'guy' in the book for the longest time turns out to be Hunter, a supporting (female) character.<br />Gaiman is an excellent storyteller. This book was so good I had to force myself to put it down, because at the time I didn't have another of his books to read.  The ending left me wanting more -- indeed, this was a mini-series in England (when do we get to see it?) that would be loved here.  Another book or two following Mayhew's life (it'll never be the same!) would enliven my own drab life!<br />Different than American Gods -- not suitable for the younger Harry Potter readers, but there's something about the decidedly English perspective that makes the violence mildly amusing (and besides, in the neverworld, the dead aren't always terminally dead!)<br />A great book, I've already passed mine on to a friend!  Enjoy!
6300181553|5.0|Holiday Inn is the video presentation of the classic movie featuring the music of Irving Berlin, starring Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire, that first performed the all-time favorite song &quot;White Christmas.&quot; An enjoyable comedy about two talented men who find themselves in hot competition for a woman's favor, Holiday Inn is both wonderfully nostalgic and brightly entertaining in its own right for contemporary viewers, having stood the test of time and come through as appealing as ever. With a running time of 1 hour, 41 minutes, Holiday Inn is a core recommendation for community library video collections and a &quot;must&quot; for fans of Irving Berlin, Bing Crosby, and Fred Astaire.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|U-571 was a Type VIIC submarine that was commissioned into the German Navy on May 22, 1941.  U-571 did 11 combat patrols under two commanders (Helmut Mohlmann and Gustav Lussow), and sank 7 enemy ships.  U-571 was lost with all hands on January 28, 1944 during an attack by Australian aircraft, after a combat career of nearly three years.  <br />Clearly the film \\"U-571\\" has nothing to do with U-571!  Of course, one usually cannot expect much from a hollywood screenplay.  The film could have been made about the British Navy capture of a German Navy Enigma device, using the title \\"U-110\\".  Or a film could have been made about the U.S. Navy capture of a German Navy submarine and used the title \\"U-505\\".  Or the film could have been about U-571!!  Any of the three preceding options would probably be beyond the intellectual grasp of the average Hollywood producer.  I have to wonder how the title \\"U-571\\" was chosen for a film that is not about U-571.  Possibly, the script writer consulted a reader of tea leaves.<br />Rather than this fantasy, I would recommend \\"Das Boot\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\", \\"The Enemy Below\\", or \\"Thunder Bay\\" (an Italian sub in a duel with a British destroyer commanded by James Mason).
0375751513|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is a mesmerizing read dominated by two amazing personalities.  Dorian Gray is certainly interesting, but I was much more impressed by his friend and mentor Lord Henry Wotton.  Dorian is a perfectly nice, well-meaning young man when we first meet him in the studio of the painter Basil Hallward.  Hallward in fact is so drawn to the youth that he draws his greatest inspiration from painting him and just being with him.  It is the influence of Hallward's friend Lord Henry which leads to Gray's downfall.  There are few characters in literature as decadent, witty, and somehow enchanting as Lord Henry.  He is never at a loss for words, fatalistic observations of life and people, sarcastic philosophical musings, and brilliantly devious ideas.  Among his world of social decadents and artistic do-nothings, his charm remains redoubtable and highly sought-after.  Gray immediately falls under his spell, soon devoting himself to living life to its fullest and enjoying his youth and beauty to the utmost.  He solemnly wishes that he could remain young and beautiful forever, that Hallward's exquisite picture of him should bear the marks of age and debauchery rather than himself.  To his surprise and ultimate horror, he finds his wish fulfilled.  Small lines and creases first appear in the portrait, but after he cruelly breaks the heart of an unfortunate young actress who then takes her own life, the first real signs of horror and blood manifest themselves on his portrait.  His love for the ill-fated Sibyl Vane is a sordid, heartbreaking tale, and it marks the culmination of his descent into debauchery.  He frequents opium dens and houses of ill repute, justifying all of his worst actions to himself, while the influence of Lord Henry continues to work its black magic on his soul.  He hides his increasingly grotesque portrait away in an upstairs room, sometimes going up to stare at it and take pleasure in the fact that it rather than he bears the stains of his iniquities.  In time, his obsession with his secret grows, and he is constantly afraid that it will be discovered by someone.  For eighteen years he lives in this manner, moving among the members of his society as a revered figure who magically retains his youth, but eventually he begins to see himself as he really is and to curse the portrait, blaming its magic for his miserable life of ill-begotten pleasures and loss of moral character.  The final pages are well-written, and the climax is eminently satisfying.<br />Exhibiting the undeniable influence of the French Decadence movement of the late 19th century, this wonderful novel serves as a morality play of sorts.  One can understand why its unique nature upset a British society emerging from the social constraints of Victorianism, but this reader is hard pressed to see why this novel proved so damaging to Wilde's eventual imprisonment and punishment.  Dorian Gray is no hero, nor does his ultimate internal struggles and yearnings for rebirth inspire one to engage in the sort of life he himself eventually came to regret.  The only \\"dangerous\\" character in this novel is Lord Henry; his delight in working his evil influence on others as a type of moral experiment and the silver-tongued charm he exploits to aid him in such misbegotten quests have the potential to do harm to a vulnerable mind such as that of Dorian Gray.  Lord Henry's evil genius makes him much more interesting than his disciple Dorian Gray.  By today's standards, this book is not shocking, and indeed it is much more dangerous to censor work such as this than it is to read it.  This book in eminently quotable, and it still manages to cast a magical spell over readers of this day and age.  Quite simply, The Picture of Dorian Gray deserves a place on the shelf of the world's greatest literature.is iniquities.

B00005JKCF|5.0|Spiderman is probably one of the greatest movies I have seen in a long time. It is packed with action and has a great lesson. IT is probably not a movie to show to younger kids but is great for anyone ready to sit back relax and enjoy a great movie.
0060001941|5.0|This book is so wonderful.  THe author describes the life of the Nolans so well, you feel as if you are actually there, experiencing the things she describes.  You are happy for Francie during the good times, sad during the bad.  This book will make you laugh, cry, and really help you to get your priorities straight.  It is a classic, and should be in every home in the country.  By not reading it, you are depriving yourself of an amazing experience.  It is great reading for teenagers as well as adults, although the readers should be mature enough to truly grasp the story's meaning.  I know some 13-year-olds who get more out of this story than some 30-year-olds.  Like I said, it all depends on maturity.  To wrap this up, I believe that this is an amazing book, and everyone should read it at least once at some point in their lives.
B00003CXXO|2.0|I purchased this movie hoping to see yet another spectacular Speilberg flick.  Boy was it a let down.  I suppose if I were a bit younger (Like 12 perhaps) I may have enjoyed it.  It was very predictable and almost a paste together of a bunch of borrowed ideas.  The Pinocchio concept was a bit far fetched, but it did make for interesting thought.  Overall I was surprised at how bad the movie kept getting and wished it had ended 1/2 an hour sooner.
6305013578|1.0|ce dvd est une horreur, je n ai jamais vu une aussi mauvaise copie de film, tout support confondu.<br /> je ne sait pas ou l editeur a trouver le master pour la gravure mais ca devais certainement etre au fond d une cave humide.<br />la bande son est a pleurer et l image ...... et bien je ne prefere pas en parler on dirait un scopitonne des annees 40.<br />de plus l intro du film est manquante ainsi que certaine scenes.<br /> enfin pour en finir garder votre argent jusqu a la sortie d une meilleur edition  celle ci ne vaut pas un clou.<br />conseil pour ceux qui comme moi ont fait l erreur d acheter ce DVD: revender le le plus vite possible.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a masterpiece! Every single piece of music is a treat! Captures the essence of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in spades! A great addition to the collection! Grade: A+
B00005YW4H|5.0|If you dont like jazz with a slight touch of country western flavor, dont buy this cd.  In fact, listen to a few songs online... before you buy it.  Otherwise, this cd is purely magical and it speaks for itself.
B000066NW0|5.0|Yes, Avril is a wonderful artist, she is respectable, and her music is fun, yet tells the truth, so whats not to love?  Well how long do I suspect that the punkpop princess is going to be around?  Well it sounds awfully mean, but its the truth, not long at all.  I believe after &quot;Complicated&quot; gets its time in the sun, some other song is going to be released from this cd, and no one is ever gonna really pay attention to it, and in two years, another cd will be released and it'll go no where, but thats just my opinion, if she gets big, she'll prove me wrong, and that'd be great.  Anyhow, I believe this 17 year old has made a horrible mistake by making this album, a mistake so horrible that if I made it, it would probably have effected me and wrecked my life as I knew it.  Avril dropped out of high school at 17, now that is just ignorant and impulsive, so that is what I disagree with her about.  But anyways, the music sounds great, just enjoy her, she'll figure out the wrong one day....if she's smart.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Obviously, this film, like most David Lynch films (with the possible exception of &quot;The Straight Story&quot;) provokes the stongest reactions from viewers.  They either love it or they hate it.  I like movies that tell their stories in unconventional ways, that challenge the intellect, and reward those who watch them more than once.  This is such a movie.  <br />I won't rehash the plot details, there's plenty of that in the other reviews, but I must mention Naomi Watts' astounding performance.  I haven't seen any of the five films that resulted in Best Actress Academy Award nominations (Okay, I don't get out much), but if there were five performances last year better than Naomi Watts' in Mulholland Drive, it must have been the best year for actresses in the history of motion pictures.<br />Technically, it's a great looking and sounding DVD. It's a pleasure to watch, which is a good thing, because unless you're a quicker study than I am, you will have to watch it several times if you hope to ever understand the story.  I don't say this to put anybody off, but this film is for people who are serious about their movies, and willing to put a little effort into their viewing.
0679882820|5.0|Another fun book by Dr. Seuss. The sounds are easy for my 1 year old to learn and immitate. She memorized them all by the simple and silly pictures that capture her attention. It encourages kids to try and do the sounds too. Dr. Seuss is always a good choice!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I've been a big fan of the books for quite sometime, and I knew someday a movie would be produced. Now it has. Christopher Columbus has done a wonderful job shaping his cast and weaving magic into this film. It follows the book closely, which, I believe, makes it all the more enjoyable. The cast was carefully chosen and they all performed quite excellently. The cleverness of some of the lines is down right genious. I have to mention Rupert Grint most particularly, he did an especially fantastic job. Daniel Radcliffe was also destined to play the part of Harry; he has the same birthday! It is a movie for children of all ages; from 8-98, everyone can enjoy it. But I think younger viewers have more of an advantage; they can more easily see and understand all of the magic and it's entirety of the secret world behind Platform 9 and 3/4. I highly recommend this film to all who have an open mind and want to have a good time.
B00001U0E1|5.0|I've just finished my third viewing of &quot;Shakespeare In Love&quot; and find it gets better each time.  I'm of the opinion it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture and should have received one for director John Madden.  He pulled performances from his actors that were breathtaking in their rightness and consistency, and he brought a forward motion to the film that only enhanced its roots.  I know a little of Shakespeare so caught many of the beautiful script's touchstones (most of which I attribute to Tom Stoppard rather than Marc Norman), but that knowledge was not necessary to enjoy the story.  Madden brought to it a sense of urgency and discovery that still amazes me, even without considering it was only his second film.<br />The actors deserve as much praise as you want to give them -- especially Judi Dench, Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes -- for bringing heart and life to characters that could easily have become charactures.<br />To me there is no question which is the better film, vis-a-vis &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.  While technically amazing in its first twenty minutes (after the God-awful opening bookend), SPR was little more than another edition of &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; with real carnage.  And Speilberg could not resist indulging in his sad bent for over-sentimentality.  You can't say that about SIL; it's magnificence personified.

0812550706|5.0|I will treasure this book forevermore.  That said, I feel the need to point out that all Card's female characters are extremely stiff, and usually annoying.  Card obviously attempts to portray women in a sympathetic light and as equally intelligent to men, but he ends up with overanalytical loudmouths who are plagued by doubts and end up only arrogantly, ungratefully hampering the males anyway.  This observation encompasses Card's Alvin Maker series as well as his Ender books, Treason, and Lost Boys.  While I'm on the subject, I also think that his male characters fall a bit flat on the personality and too heavy on the logic as well.<BR>With that off my chest, Ender's Game is one of the most interesting and enjoyable books I have ever had the pleasure of reading, as well as being the book that kicked off my interest in science fiction.  It takes a stubborn mind to resist the allure of Ender's world and Battle School, where the brightest children are sent to train as child-soldiers for the next war.  The Buggers, the alien race the humans are warring with, really play a minimal part in the story until the very end.  Mostly Ender's Game deals with Ender, the little boy who is the smartest of all the genius children, the leader of them all, and his relationships with the other kids, and how they all get through the rigorous, ruthless training of Battle School.  It's fascinating, the little plots and brilliant strategem the students employ against each other, with the added shock that they're all small children, though to just read the dialogues you'd never guess it.<BR>Ender's Game should be read by one and all, of all ages.  For a while I considered it the best sci-fi book out there...Then Ender's Shadow was published.
B00005NKCM|5.0|Despite being created in the early 1970's, this series seems like it could have been created in Edwardian England. I remember watching bit's of it as a child on TV and find the DVDs absolutely spellbinding.  Being able to watch episode after episode at my leisure, on my schedule is absolutely luxurious.  I have a portable DVD player and this series is great to travel with since there are so many hours per disk.

0446608955|5.0|I've read Nicholas Sparks' highly rated &quot;The Notebook&quot; sometime ago but find the story &quot;common&quot; and not at all enjoyable. Since &quot;The Notebook&quot; is widely known as his best book (but I didn't like it at all), I decided against reading another Sparks' novel, UNTIL recently when I saw the wonderful movie, &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; which is adapted from a novel by Sparks. The movie was SO good that I just had to give the Sparks novel a try. And happily, I was not dissapointed.<br />The tender love story involving a teenage boy and girl will tug at your heartstrings and make you rethink the true meaning of love. The movie adaptation is great; in fact, I actually loved the movie better than the book but I would highly recommend the book to anyone who loves a good love story and to those who've watched and enjoyed the movie.<br />There're some differences between the book and the movie e.g. in the book, the story's set in the 1950s but in the movie, it's set in modern day. Also, in the movie, Landon Carter's character is portrayed as a popular high school student who hangs out with the in-crowd, gets into trouble with the school authority and comes from a broken home. But in the book, his character is actually studious and homely, and his parents are still together.<br />Nevertheless, I think that if you've watched the movie, you should still pick up the book if only just to find out the (incredible!) depth of Landon's love for Jamie even 40 years after she's gone. This is only revealed in the last 2 paragraphs of the book, but the revelation will touch you to the core and make you cry and marvel at the beauty of true love!!
B000000JO3|5.0|This CD is a classic.  A must have for anyone who likes hardcore or punk.  I can't say enough about this CD.  I still start to type album because I first got it on vinyl.  That album is almost worn out so it is good that Dischord released it on CD.  I can get the same feeling listening to this some 20 years later that I did the first time I heard it. You know, if you listen to this long enough, you can actually dance to it.  I'm serious.  Buy it and see.
B00003CXI1|1.0|. . . who disliked the DVD as much as he did the film.<br />A bit of history: when I first heard that J.K. Rowling's series had been optioned for the silver screen, I was ecstatic . . . for about a minute.  Then the sensible, cautious moviegoer's instincts about big-budget blockbusters kicked in.  &quot;Oh no,&quot; I said to myself.  &quot;Harry is doomed!&quot;<br />If you've already seen the movie and loved it, you can stop right here.  If you've read the series and haven't seen the movie (I don't know, maybe you live in a cave or were hiking the AT or deeply involved with your bedbug collection and missed it) I'll tell you this: Don't expect the fey, smart-alecky, tongue-trippingly fun-to-read prose to translate at all.  It doesn't.  It's a worse book-to-film transfer than any Stephen King movie you care to name--and that's sayin' summat!<br />It begins with the actor portraying Harry Potter.  He redefines minimalist performance, using approximately three facial expressions throughout the film: slightly startled, mildly pleased, and semi-awestruck.  Moving on to the horribly miscast Richard Harris--Oh Caesar, how thou hast fallen.  I expected Dumbledore to be a little more sprightly, and act a little less like he was just bumped off by Joaquin Phoenix.  Of all the actors I expected to play McGonagall, Maggie Smith was the last.  Want to see Maggie Smith in her element?  Try &quot;Gosford Park&quot; or &quot;Room With a View.&quot;  Alan Rickman as Snape--I liked the idea, but they gave him so little to work with.  The movie's Snape was about as malevolent as a mailbox.  The best part of Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone was the (computer generated) Quidditch match.<br />I don't own this DVD.  I wouldn't take this DVD for free.  The only reason I didn't walk out of this movie in the theater was that I kept thinking, &quot;Okay, but it can't get any worse . . .&quot;  My suggestion?  Stick to the books.  Your imagination and J.K. Rowling's engaging style are way, way better than anything Hollywood could ever come up with.  I promise.
B00005JKJA|1.0|The only reason I gave this movie one star was because there was no option for NO STARS.<BR>All I did throughout the movie was wait.<BR>I waited for the movie to begin... I watched and waited and waited... after an hour, when i realized that it had in fact begun, I simply waited for something to bring the jumbled mess of mediocre acting and poor writing together... anything that would make the movie worth the dread of watching it... <BR>When I could do that no longer, I then just waited for the credits to roll.<BR>Those who claim that this movie is for film buffs and aficionados of cinema only say so to grasp a false sense of superiority over those normal and sane individuals that see this movie for what it is: garbage.<BR>It's endless array of pointless scenes and characters was as equally entertaining as watching ice melt.<BR>Actually, perhaps the ice melting could prove more enjoyment.<BR><BR>So, to all the pretentious individuals with gold sceptres up their [black holes]: It's ok to admit that the movie was horrible. Really, it was. Obviously this was not intended to be hollywood's typical straight-forward flick. But the [darn] thing was putrid cow manure and don't be ashamed to agree. The emperor won't get mad at you. He is, after all, the naked one.
B000001ZCS|5.0|This recording does not disappoint, it excels.  This is the same as the original vinyl release in content.  I find myself skipping over \\"Seedy Films\\" and \\"Secret Life\\" from time to time, but thats just because \\"Youth/Sex Dwarf\\" and \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\" are just THAT good.  They even throw in \\"Tainted Love\\"... perhaps you've heard that one before?  I would highly recommend this release, BUT they released this with BONUS TRACKS and if you can spare the dough you will not be disappointed as their B sides and remixes compare with their other material and also come highly recommended by me.  Enjoy!
B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Let Go,\\" the first hit cd of the year, by the new coming, and more popular than ever, 17 year old Avril Lavigne. Her debut Cd Let Go is a smash!!! Every single song had me moving! Especially\\"Sk8r Boi,\\" and her debut hit single, \\"Complicated.\\" all though some songs may be slower, \\"Too Much Too Ask,\\" and \\"I'm With You) they are as awesome as ever!! She can even rap!!! (Nobody's Fool) This young multi-talented girl is sure to make it big.
B00005Y1Z4|5.0|I cant give more than 5 stars!! =)  This release is THAT GOOD.  Beginning to end, or end to beginning... its yours to play with as you like.  Seriously, I dont skip any songs on this gem (ok maybe &quot;seedy films&quot; and rarely &quot;secret life&quot;) I just hit repeat.  The Non-Stop Ecstatic Dancing with the bonus mixes is the release to get (like TOTALLY!), but after that one grab this one.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver tells the reader the story of Jonas, who lives in a community, which seems to be a perfect world by having very strict rules. At his Ceremony of Twelve he is selected as a new Reciever of Memory\\". That means that he gets to see things which the others in the community aren't able to see. Gradually, Jonas notices how the real world\\" looks like. <br />Our opinion:<BR>It's a good book for a school-book. The beginning is very boring, but page by page it gets more interesting. Especially the moments when Jonas gets the memories are written very well so that you can imagine these situations. After the first chapters, you don't want to stop reading the book. The book makes you thinking about our own society.<br />We would recomment to read this book. :o)
B00005JG6R|5.0|I think Akira is great.If you are a fan of anime or if this is your first anime film you will most likely enjoy this intense,powerful,film.The characters have a personality which is strong,violent,and nice.The plot is about a boy named Tetsou when he has a motorcycle acciddent. The milatary interferes and does an experiment on him which unleashes a pschcic power that devastates Neo Tokyo!This is tale about freindship,loss,and normal problems this is definetly a film worth seeing.
B00000K19E|5.0|The interesting thing about this movie is, whether you like it or not, it is a classic already.  We don't need to wait and see if it lasts another 20 or 30 years.  Let's hope it isn't pulled out that long anyway, look what happened to Star Wars.  The great thing about it is that it is not just eye-candy.  It is what we have all been waiting for- sci-fi that makes you think.  The only downside is that I am tired of people being confused by it.  Sure, maybe it is a complicated movie, but please pay attention.  To sum up, I think the movie is best described in the words of Keanu Reeves- &quot;Whoa!&quot;
B00000ADG2|2.0|The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, is, expectedly, not as great as it is hailed as- how could it be- this is one of the most critically acclaimed albums of all time- no album could live up to that.  However, it's really not very good at all, even if I give it leeway, for being impossible to live up to expectations.  The songs aren't musically special.  And while a definite cut above most rap and R&amp;B pap like Ashanti, etc, (for instance the songs aren't jarring and actually seem to try to convey a message about social and personal struggles) the songs still fail to leave much of an impression, be it musical or social.  It seems that during some good songs like &quot;Everything Is Everything&quot; they came up with a good chorus, a good beat, but couldn't figure out how to complete the song, so they interjected a rapping interlude.  If like me, you can't stand most rap but are still open to future enlightenment of its type, this album will not win you over as a new fan of rap.  It pretty much disrupts the whole flow of the songs.  &quot;Doo Wop (that thing)&quot; is another example of a song that started out great, with an intriguing choir and horn arrangment, then had to develop into this rapping stuff that is smug and unenthusiastic in delivery and very unpleasant to listen to.  Which leads into my next assessment.  Lauryn Hill is not very likable.  This album doesn't really showcase her vulnerable side at all, and there is always a distance between the listener and artist, which there should never be on a &quot;soul&quot; album.  For these reasons, I rarely listen to this album, but I wouldn't say it's downright terrible.
B0000668IF|4.0|Well this cd is great, however if you are looking for a cd similer to play. This is not for you. Moby had decided to do more electic experimental music on this album. It is not bad, and the more I listen to it the better I think it is, just keep in mind that it is not the Moby we used to know for Play.
B000059XYL|3.0|When saw this movie with a big group of people, the reception was mixed.  My take is that it's as light and easy-to-swallow as a souffle.  It's fairly cute, occasionally clever, occasionally bad, never tries to reach for a level of dramatic depth, and succeeds within its own limitations.  The story is fairly hackneyed but painlessly rendered.  Violet (Piper Perabo) moves to New York to become a singer-songwriter, instead finding herself as a provacative bartender at the Coyote Ugly bar, whilst falling in love with an Australian fry cook (Adam Garcia).  I prefer this movie infinitely over other Jerry Bruckheimer creations.  It is much better than Flashdance, a similar-themed story.  <br />True the acting isn't Oscar-worthy and some of the dialogue falls flat, but what was this movie trying to do?  Entertain.  And it succeeds enormously.  <br />A guilty pleasure.<br />(extra note: this DVD provides one of the most entertaining commentary tracks with the cast doing a relay on each scene with joyful glee).
B00003Q43A|4.0|After the sucess of Stargate, director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin did the old \\"bigger is better\\" modus operandi with Independence Day. Upon it's release, critcs bemoaned the film's over-the-top jingionism, cheesy heroic antics and disaster movie cliche staples- \\"Oh, quick, save the dog before the giant fireball destroys the city!\\" And to be fair, the film did deserve it's critisism, but as a cheesy, sentimental sci fi action blockbuster, it's one of the best.<br />For all Will Smith's jibes and Bill Pullman's heroics, it's Jeff Goldblum who comes off as the main man, pulling the same shtick as in Jurassic Park (\\"Must go faster!\\"). The film does get very silly at times, but never takes itself too seriously, creating a feel-good tone that works well within the caveats of the genre. Emmerich's ham-fisted direction gets tiresome at times, with so many sci fi cliches, you start to wish someone had thrown in an original idea or two. But the film gets four stars for action, visuals and some well-timed humour.<br />The SFX utilised are astounding, with some truly breathtaking visuals, and that now-famous shot of the white house getting blown to smithereens by aliens! It's good-natured, brainless fun, that while predictable and silly, is still one impressive movie that is a must-have on DVD. The extras are great, with commentaries on the first disc, and on disc 2 a wealth of extras including that famous Superbowl trailer \\"Enjoy the Superbowl, it may be your last\\", tons of \\"making of\\" docos and lots more production info.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Just like wishing Barrys Sanders and Mark McGuire would come back... Willard did!!! The original Apocalypse was a movie to watch over and over. When \\"the making of\\" came out, I watched it just before each viewing of the movie. It was then that I realized how much more the original could be. Francis hits it right on with the additional footage. The story-line and characters are more developed and makes the original now seem like a \\"rush\\" up the river. THREE CHEERS (and four stars) for Francis!
1577311523|5.0|This book really and truly has changed my life. If I had one personal item to take to a deserted island, this book would be my choice.<br />I've read a lot of spiritually oriented books over the years, and I've gained much from them. After reading Eckhart's message in The Power of Now, I felt like \\"this is really *it*\\"; no need to look anymore. I still feel that way, and I think that it's been around two years since I first read it. The external search for truth is finally over for me. His audio tapes & CD's are also excellent, and are always surprisingly fresh and new.<br />I personally believe that Eckhart is one of a very few true masters to walk this Earth. Do yourself a favor and buy this book (& some of his tapes); you won't be sorry.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Hearing that the DVD of Harry Potter featured bonus scenes and additional insight into the making of the film, I chose to splurge on the DVD over the VHS version. Mind you, I did not own a DVD player when I ordered this film. The morning after my shipment arrived, I went to the store to purchase a DVD player and that night, we watched the movie. The quality of the DVD is wonderful and the sound is amazing (we hooked it up to our stereo speakers). The bonus features include a tour of Hogwarts as well as &quot;skits&quot; with the sorting hat and even web-interactive activities in which I have not yet particpated. All-in-all, this is a great way to watch the movie though the widescreen viewing makes my 20&quot; television seem even smaller. I suppose that is the only downside, now I need a TV that can hold its own with Harry Potter's DVD quality.
6304806442|5.0|Movies SHOULD make you think, and boy does this film do that!  \\"Trainspotting,\\" an uncompromising look into the lives of heroin addicts, is not for those with weak stomachs, or weak minds for that matter.  Is it anti-drug or pro-drug?  I don't know, but it sure turned me off from ever trying heroin.  <BR>Ewan McGregor's breakthrough role as Renton made him a star.  In this film, he is the dirtiest, skinniest, and most unattractive I have ever seen him.  But he's very good anyway.  He plays a young man with no ideals (until later) except having a good hit.  It's disturbing to watch what happens as he struggles to stay clean.  <BR>This is not a pretty picture.  This movie is sad, disgusting, and doesn't allow for sympathy for any characters except Renton only occasionally.  But it's engrossing.  You might be so appauled by what you see that you keep watching.  You might know someone who is a drug addict who struggles like these guys do and feel what they're going through in some fashion.  Or you might turn away from drugs altogether once you see the extreme of consequences.<BR>Warning: You may hate this movie.  You may be offended.  If you are, I won't think less of you.  But remember, America does have a drug culture too, and there are people like Renton and Sick Boy (my God, and even Begby) present in our society. Sometimes movies show us things about ourselves that we don't want to see.  It's one of the most difficult cinematic tasks, but I think this movie pulls it off.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I love this album!! Today I was kinda at lost at which CD I should buy - &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; or this disc. I decided on 18 and I was at awe of the album. In no way it's a part deux of Play. But a different album... with more guest vocals and a different aray of music. Some of my favorites are:<br />01. We Are All Made Of Stars - I love this song, it seems as though the album ver. is different than the one you see on MTV for the video.<br />02. In This World - I like the vocals on the song<br />03. Great Escape - This song is amazing, and the vocals done by Azure Ray are wonderful. With its softness and the music backing her are amazing.<br />04. One of These Mornings - Diane  McCaulley does excellent vocals and I love the effects that Moby did to her voice.<br />05. Sleep Alone - I read that this was the haunting track of 18 with it's feeling to 9-11. Perhaps it was written after that day, but I do think this song is sort of sad.<br />06. At Least We Tried - The title sounded like someone was sounding off defeat, I love Freedom Breemer's voice for the song - it's perfect for the words.<br />07. Harbour - It's by Sinéad O'Connor and sounds like something that belonged on her last album 'faith and courage' with the background music. I love her Irish sounding voice.<br />08. Look Back In - Sounds something of a track that should belong on a music soundtrack or in a movie. What type? Depends. One of those war movies like 'Black Hawk Down' but Moby doesn't really like war... or maybe even one of those Spy Thrillers with a neat remix but still captures the core of the song.
078322687X|5.0|This is quite possibly one of the finest movies ever made.  I felt every second of angst, every laugh, every tear of these characters.  John Hughes is not only known for writing gag movies like \\"Weird Science\\" and \\"National Lampoon's Vacation,\\" but he's famous for his journeys into the teenage psyche.  He knows how teenagers talk (or at least how they talked in 1985) and the kinds of pressures they deal with. <BR>John Bender (a brilliant Judd Nelson) is the badass.  His abusive past gives him a rough exterior but a fragile interior. Brian Johnson (Anthony Michael Hall) is the geek, dying to belong with the popular crowd but committed to being smart.  Claire Standish (Molly Ringwald), the prom queen every girl hated in high school, becomes aware of her own snobbery and learns how much she hurts others by being spoiled.  Emilio Estevez plays jock Andrew Clark who tries to please his old man by always being a winner.  Finally, Ally Sheedy does a wonderful job playing Allison Reynolds, a crazy outsider who just wants someone to pay attention to her. <BR>The language is raw, the emotions are real, and the camaraderie between the characters is one of those bonds that is never forgotten.  They learn that they have some things in common, most obviously a hatred for the principal and the school system.  If you are an adult, watch this film to remember what being young was like.  If you are a teenager, you can relate to the demons each character has inside.  If you're a kid, you're not supposed to be watching this movie.  You'll only understand it when you rediscover it at age 15.  That's what happened to me.  I've seen this movie so many times and it still hits me every viewing.
0613325419|4.0|I thought this would be a neat addition to the other Harry Potter books, and it is.  Just a little disappointed in the length (very short), but it has the same style of JK Rowling's writtings and was entertaining.
6305622914|5.0|\\"The Full Monty\\" is one of those rare films that gets comedy and drama JUST RIGHT!!  This is the story of Gaz, an unemployed former criminal who is trying to maintain his relationship with his son.  When his ex-wife seeks full custody, he must find a way to start raising his support money.  He gathers his mates and devises a scheme where they would put on a stripper show.  Hilarity ensues. <BR>Robert Carlyle is great in this movie, not nearly as severe and evil as his role as Begby in \\"Trainspotting.\\"  He demonstrates a softer side that allows the audience to root for him.  Mark Addy and Tom Wilkinson give strong performances as friends Dave and Gerald, respectively.  Dave struggles with his weight and his marriage while Gerald hopes to find a job quickly to pay his wife's credit card bills.  These are real life situations these men face.  It's all believable and human.  <BR>It's no wonder this film was among the five that year nominated for Best Picture.  Curses to \\"Titanic\\" for being such a big deal!  But the Oscars helped more people discover this relatively smaller picture (which I believe is only in terms of budget and gross) and now it has become a kind of cult favorite in the U.S.  <BR>One suggestion to American audiences: If you're going to watch the DVD, turn the subtitles on.  The accents are thick, so this will help you understand it.
B000001ZSF|5.0|This is an album containing music which has a very futuristic feel to it.  Chronologie 2 is very strident, Chronologie 3 has an atmospheric 'floating through space' feel about it, whilst Chronologie 4 is one of Jarre's finest ever pieces of music.  Whether you're thinking of evolution or outer space while you're listening to this CD, the music is filled with wonder and really does transport you to another universe.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|The first time I saw this film it was in a theatre with only ten other people in it.  I wasn't bothered, although now I wish more people had seen it.  I was able to view it with minimal distractions and I was glad.  It is one of the most remarkable movies I have ever seen.<BR>I will admit that I wasn't a fan of Baz Luhrman's take on &quot;Romeo and Juliet.&quot;  Guess why?  I thought it was too modern.  I threw that criticism aside and saw what I could only describe as a modern take on a turn-of-the-century Paris romance.  For some reason, I thought the remakes of many of today's best songs really fit the film.  This is a pop-clad, trippy, fantastic trip to the past.  Yet it holds on to something we can relate to.<BR>Ewan McGregor, my knight in shining armor, is wonderful.  He enveloped the character of Christian with the right amount of boyish charm and heartache (and sings quite well too!). Such a breakthrough for him. Needless to say, Nicole Kidman is gorgeous and perfect for the part of Satine.  She most certainly deserved her Golden Globe and her Oscar nod. John Leguizamo said it best when he called her &quot;a modern day Ann Margret.&quot;<BR>An underrated spectacular performance came from Jim Broadbent as the flamboyant Harry Zidler. He demonstrates a lot of power in this role that often gets ignored because it's supporting.<BR>Enjoy the lights, the costumes, the glamour, the music of this landmark cinematic achievement.  Don't forget: always believe in truth, freedom, beauty, and above all things, love.
B00004Z459|5.0|To who ever is reading this, Linkin Park is an incredibally talented band, They are not just another Rock_Rap Band, All of their songs ahve their own unique vibe to it, With Chetser's Powerful Voice and Mike's Rhyming Raping Skills together with Brad's Guitars, Pheonix's Bass, Rob's drumming and let's not for get Mr. Hahn's DJ Skills they deliver the most incredible Music on earth. YOU will never ever get tired of this CD and they can tell their message which all of us can relate to with out constantly using the F word like other bands, If you buy the CD you will not regret it. TRUST ME....
B000001FY9|5.0|The Chili Peppers had it right.  Bob Marley might be more popular and influential now, over 20 years after his death.  Like others have alluded to, have you ever met anyone who doesn't like Bob Marley?  He is the only artist I know who is beloved by all, a tricky thing in the fickle music biz.  Though \\"Songs of Freedom\\" is the ideal Marley, \\"Legend\\" is great for that one CD to take in your car.  It is THE soundtrack to summer road trips, and the way I got into this in 1984 when it was first released.  This CD might be the one CD that will someday pass the Eagles Greatest Hits as the best-selling CD in U.S. history.  You can give yourself no better present than this!!
B00005RFAI|3.0|I like this woman. Her videos are very nice too. I was kind of dissappointed because only 3 songs are worth the album but they are GREAT songs: Just like a pill, Don't let me get me and Get the party started
B000002H6C|5.0|Seem like hell for Metallica these years, but nothing is perfect, never was and never will. Only thing it mattered is the works they had demonstrated for this album, of all the albums this is the best. The reason metallica will endure for many many years entertaining us is just giving the release for the [things] we have to put up in our daily lives and that is great.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Let's be honest, this is a typical example of a stupid movie that just happens to be VERY entertaining. Reese is amazing and extremely funny. And what's up with the friend in the Beauty Parlor..I just laugh looking at the woman. Selma Blair is also very good here as well as in Cruel Intentions.
B000001A3H|5.0|I saw Kyuss open for Faith No More in a tiny club about ten years ago. These (then) little-known monolithic sonic sludgemasters gave the headliners a run for their money, catching the crowd completely off guard as they proceeded to bury us in undulating waves of crusty distortion and palpable bass damage. I bought this (then) newly-released cd the very next day and was not dissapointed:Kyuss managed the extremely difficult feat of adequately conveying the power of their live sound as much as is possible for an oh-so-analog band reproduced in a digital medium. These fellas deliver stoner/doom/crust/psych/grunge of the highest order, and have apparently achieved legendary status in the current retro stoner-rock underground. Kyuss, however, were definitely not a retro act. While the influence of early hard rock/metal is readily apparent, Kyuss delvered such an unqualified wallop that they stand as one of the most physically massive sounds I have experienced, even to this day(and after 10 years of death/black metal, industrial, hard techno, japanoise, noise rock, etc). Imagine Blue Cheer playing through instruments/amps owned by and tuned to the specifications of Napalm Death, with other touchstones including the Melvins, early Soundgarden, Amon Duul II's \\"Yeti\\" album, and a mid-day drive through Death Valley in a duststorm with the windows down. Crushing!
0440203856|5.0|Excellent, old fashion DS. One of her best books. Very entertaining and keeps you glued to the book
B00003CXI1|4.0|Having not read any of JK Rowling's books was apparently a blessing in terms of purely enjoying the film version of Book 1.  This is a thoroughly entertaining, richly layered film, with smart, supreme special effects, plenty of &quot;oohs and aahs&quot; and a nice mix of charming players, engaging plot devices and technical wizardry.  Few true Harry Potter fanatics have expressed satisfaction with the film, which apparently sticks so closely to its book source, it misses the magic these readers had themselves conjured up in their imagination.  As a result, a non-Potter-initiated viewer as myself was quickly swept away by the grandeur and illusion that unfolds on screen.  The young Radcliffe seems the perfect choice, though I hope he grows into the role as he himself grows up - some scenes are wooden, and his slightly crooked smile seems out of place at times.  His cohorts are equally engaging, though Hermoine's character is at times a challenge to enjoy.  Ron Weasly is more effective both as a character and in terms of the actor who plays him, as he gives him real humanity throughout.  A few scenes are simply awe-inspiring - Track 9 and 3/4 in London, playing quiddich in the air, the invisible cloak, the owl-delivery system at Hogwarts, and the 3-headed dog chose.  Maggie Smith is winning, but Robbie Coltraine steals the movie with his tender performance as Hagrid.  All in all, this is a strong start to what will hopefully become a classic on the order of the &quot;Wizard of Oz.&quot;  Don't judge Harry by his (book) cover - enjoy the thrilling film ride and you'll be glad you did.
B0000636UN|3.0|Sheryl is talanted, beautiful and has a very nice body for a woman her age. I loved her on the video. I have 3 of Sheryl's albums and regarding this one I have to say that I only loved one song: Soak up the sun. The rest is simply...OK
B000063JDE|1.0|If your taste runs towards the morose, then David Lynch's &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; is for you.  Unfortunately, there is little in this widely acclaimed film that makes it watchable or enjoyable.  It's a depressing exercise in non-humanity, and is better left on the shelf.  The director shocks us into thinking his characters have a real raison d'etre, when in fact there is little to explain why they behave the way they do.  A waste of talent, time and critical support.
0380789035|4.0|At 628 pages, `American Gods' is a giant jellybean bag of a book with a tendency to sprawl all over the place. The premise of the book is fascinating: Every wave of settlers to America brought their own Gods with them, and when belief in these Gods died, the Gods lived on, making a living as best as they can. Shadow, a released convict, finds himself a pawn in a game played by the mightiest of the Norse pantheon, Mr Wednesday. He finds himself being dragged all over the USA, meeting the surviving Gods living in reduced circumstances, as Mr Wednesday tries to gather them all together to fight the new Gods of the Internet, the motor vehicle, and the rest of modern technology. Sadly, the end is a little anti-climatic. The apocalyptic war that is promised throughout the book peters out with a whimper rather than a bang. However, if the end disappoints, the telling of the story doesn't. Gaiman takes the reader on a fascinating journey, with lots of interesting asides that add to the narrative rather than deflect from it. The writing is both vivid and elusive. Gaiman is a one-off original. I'm off to check his other writings.
6303140157|5.0|I liked this inspirational movie. Whoopie did a good job turning the kids around and making a success story out of a mischevious set of kids who really had hidden talent. This movie has alot of humorous parts and a few emotional scenes. I highly reccomend this to anyone, especially to the kids. One Love.
038533558X|5.0|this book, as his last, is certainly suspenseful. Is certainly exciting. Is certainly quite well written. Is certainly interesting. And has certainly got some very real characters, feeling some very real emotions. <br />There is not a lot else that can be said, really. <br />I'm sure you know the plot, i shant summarise it. <br />On hearing what it would be, i was afraid that it would be far too much like &quot;Tell No One&quot; but luckily HC has managed to keep himself out of that rut, and produce a book which is distinct, fresh, and bears only very very small similarities to Tell No One. He suceeds in making the plot very different in its execution, although it holds a similar style. <br />There are many many great twists. Right until the final 100 pages, it is impossible to see how any of it all connects together, or will make sense. It all seems completely impossible. Yet, Harlan Coben is able to provide an eloquent solution which satisfies, and explains. Well done.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I am a big Incubus fan, and when Morning View came out, I was so excited! This is absolutely an INCREDIBLE CD! What I love so much about it is the fact that no two songs sound alike. The lyrics are wonderful! To be honest I need a dictionary to look up some of the words. He has a great vocabulary! Brandon Boyd (the lead singer) has a beautiful voice and everyone in the band does a great job of making every song work. I would definately reccomend this CD for everyone!!! I don't think it is quite as hard as their previous albums, but they have got a good mix of calm songs, hard songs, and just right songs. There's something for everyone here! BUY IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!
0380729407|5.0|I had to write to say do NOT listen to the many reviews of this book describing it as empty, dated, lacking creativity, etc. If you're familiar with Bradbury at all, this book will live up to your expectations of his typical high quality of writing. If you are not familiar with Bradbury, I'd personally say start with something closer to F451, Martian Chronicles, or some short stories to get a feel for Bradbury, but regardless of when you read this book, you'll be impressed. Bradbury creates suspense throughout the book, in fact, the only reason I read this book so quickly was because I simply could not put it down! There's no way to describe the magic bradbury creates, please, do yourself a favor and read this and every other Bradbury story you can get your hands on!
B00005YXZH|3.0|I do not understand the critical acclaim this album is receiving. Having listened to Wilco from the beginning of its existence, and Uncle Tupelo before then, I saw great potential in Jeff Tweedy and hoped he would grow as an artist. Sadly, YHF is very disappointing.  While its artistic attempts are very clear, it fails to stand up musically.  Using hackneyed studio techniques to obscure Wilco's charming simplicity - once treated as a point of pride, now treated as an obstacle - the album takes you on a repetitive, pretentious journey. While many are comparing this album to the Beatles' 'Sgt. Peppers', or The Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds', I think it unfair to attribute Wilco's YHF with comparable importance when nothing new or daring appears on this album. Always trying to justify their artistic integrity to themselves, there is a rampant musical insecurity that runs within this half of the Uncle Tupelo dynasty. YHF destroys the natural emotion and energy Jeff Tweedy exudes, portraying a simpleton's idea of art instead of honestly sharing his music with us. On the positive side, his lyrics are courageous, severe and sad, by far Tweedy's strongest work as a lyricist. I only wish he could be so bold as a musician.
1587990717|5.0|The author ought to be congratulated for mounting a forceful attack on the conventional wisdom of using a so-called track record to corroborate financial acumen and investing genius, of which the irredeemably enamoured Wall Street and the mass media are the major exponents. The lucid prose makes the book at once perspicacious and sardonically humorous. From the Bayesian perspective, it is all but a philosophical impossibility to let the &quot;data speak for themselves&quot; when dealing with uncertainties.  One needs to have a prior, which is best elicited by the appreciation of the contingent nature of life, one of the infinite manifestations of which is the financial market.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Even though I haven't heard the full album yet, hearing it's one hit &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; was enough to convince me that this girl is going very, VERY far! The enchanting voice of Ms. Jones instantly gave me chills upon first listening, it's really one of those things that you can't help but love. Definitely worth your dollar!
B000063S6Z|3.0|Let's face it, there are some wonderful songs on Moby's newest release, \\"18\\", but there are some really crummy ones in addition.  It is not bad, but doesn't even compare to \\"Play,\\" Moby's 1999 masterpiece.  I would probably enjoy \\"18\\" much more if I hadn't heard \\"Play\\" first to compare it against.<br />In my mind, the only really outstanding tracks off of \\"18\\" are \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\", \\"Signs of Love\\", and \\"Fireworks.  Again, these don't come even close to any of Play's material, but are still very good.  If Moby released these three tracks with \\"Play\\" that would have been awesome!<br />A couple of the remaining tracks are just plain space fillers.  As for \\"Great Escape\\" I wasted four valuable minutes of my life listening to that song.  IT IS TERRIBLE!!!  As for \\"Jam for the Ladies,\\" it does not have the energy of \\"Bodyrock\\" from Play.  The idea is about the same for both tracks, but one is much better.<br />As for the rest of the tracks, they are good.  Not bad.  Not great.  Just good.  Most of them are fairly neutral.  I'm guessing that Moby just saved all that great energy for \\"Play\\" and just decided to make a couple extra bucks off of \\"18.\\"<br />As the great Neil Young said, \\"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\\"
B0000062FJ|5.0|Although I missed the 60's by nearly a decade, that didn't stop me from discovering the music that was rock. And what rock it was that I heard. From Santana to Janis Joplin to Stevie Wonder, rock and roll has always had a place in my life and in my heart, as it always will. And Santana's first album is one of several reasons why, especially with those 3 new bonus tracks at the end. Not to be missed!
0060277246|5.0|To all of the people that have read this book before, I would highly recommend this edition. Most people would agree that this is a very good story and it most likely takes them back to their childhood. When I first saw this edition, I knew that I had to have it. It reminded me of some of the best books that I had read as a child. From the opening of the cover to the last page, I was awestruck by the illustrations. They are great. There are very few books for this age group that have the quality that this book has. It is just beautiful. I look forward to the day that I can share this book with my children.
B00000J7J4|2.0|Call me a naysayer, pessimist, what you will, but I really have to agree with fellow &quot;party poopers&quot; who &quot;just like to ruin a good thing,&quot; or so they say, that Carlos has sold his soul to mainstream pop. Upon first hearing that Santana was signing onto pop label Arista, my immediate first response was &quot;Uh, Oh.&quot; And having pop producer Clive Davis on board didn't help things much, either. Don't get me wrong, this album has it's moments (such as his collabrations with Eric Clapton and the Dave Matthews Band), but for the most part, I would much rather remember Santana for &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; rather than for &quot;Smooth.&quot; It's okay, but the money's better well spent on Santana's first three albums.
0792836634|4.0|I got this flick from Blockbuster video and I have to admit this movie is suprisingly good.  I know a doll with a serial killer's soul is scary but throw in a knife and you got one of the smallest serial killers in movie history!!  This doll is one mean S.O.B. and not to be taken lightly.  I wish there was gore  but only when the doll got killed. Damn!  If I compared this to other movies, this movie is the most suprising I have ever seen to date.  if you want a good horror flick with a bit of a tickle, this movie is for you, people.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a great movie for all fans of anime and for those who want to know what its all about....even Ebert had to give this one a thumbs up....I recommend it to any one that would see it.
B00005NRNB|5.0|I love the new superbit collection dvds.  Criterion collection a vista are both doing a great job in creating movie viewing pleasure Through extras, picture and sound but superbit is coming back with some strong DVD's.  The sound is so strong and tight.  Utilization of every field of sound leds to an experience you will not forget.  I've watched this movie ten or more times before the superbit.  Now I haved added to this number greatly.  Wolfgang Peterson has made one of those few movies that make you happy for watching it.  Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman did a fantasic job with each character.  All I can say is watch it on the superbit and you can thank me later.
6304711875|5.0|This is a clever film!  All the characters are funny and very likable.  I was most impacted by Stu's performance (Matthew Lillard) he is so funny in mostly everything he does but this one was great!  I thought the actors/ actresses did and awsome job.  <BR>The basic idea of the story was captaviting and funny.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Yes I waited in a long line to watch Harry Potter at the movies, and I also bought the DVD and I am 25.  It is a great movie for everyone of any age.  Going to the movies was a great experience because kids were dressed up and ready and excited.  Now the DVD lives up to the fun.  Hours of extras are included as you navigate through a number of puzzles.  Once you complete the puzzles only then are the extras found.  The movie itself has a great feel.  Both picture and sound quality are excellent. I highly recommend Harry Potter.
B00006690F|4.0|Eminem's third album, The Eminem Show, lacks the amazing tracks of the Marshall Mathers LP, such as \\"Marshall Mathers,\\" \\"Criminal,\\" and \\"Stan.\\" However, this album is by far the MC's most consistent and actually  is the second best of his three albums.  The smash single \\"Without Me\\" is the most radio friendly track, while \\"Say What You Say\\" featuring Dr. Dre is an excellent response to Jermaine Dupri's boasting. \\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" and \\"White America,\\" though, are the album's two standout tracks. The former song puts an end to Eminem's feud with his mother Debbie Mathers, while the latter is a brilliant (and incredibly harsh) diatribe insulting American stereotypes and advocates of censorship such as Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. All in all, the album is well worth the price becuase of its incredible consistency-- THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS ON THIS ALBUM.
B00005RYKU|3.0|Glass House is alright.  It has many great twist and turns.  The problem is you can see them all.  After about forty minutes the movie became redundent.  Her plans were foiled over and over again.  A less than great plot left with a number of &quot;I knew that was going to happen or the movie would be over with.&quot;
B00003CXAY|5.0|These two films by Godfrey Reggio are absolute poetry in motion and music.  I have been waiting for their release on DVD since the format was introduced; I have literally worn out my VHS copy of 'Koyaanisqatsi'.  The only films of this type which come close to equalling the quality of these two films are the films of Ron Fricke (Baraka, for example [which I also recommend]).  I cannot recommend any films more highly.
B00005RHGL|5.0|This is one of the top 10 best DVD's to come out.  It is one of those few DVD's that deliver on the digital technology.  Picture quality is flawless. The picture rating on this DVD is GOLD.  Along with the picture comes a digital track that brings to your home the wild west.  Disc 2 has a varity of goodies like &quot;Making An Authentic Western,&quot; and &quot;The Gunfight At The O.K. Corral.&quot;  Please purchase this one for your collection. You will be satisfied by the amount of efforts that was placed upon this DVD by Vista Series.  Beyond the DVD the movie is one to watch over and over again.
0060926317|1.0|On first reading I thought Morgan's book was inspirational and contained a very positive message. As an Australian I was however concerned over some of the details of the book, that didn't quite add up to my knowledge of Aboriginal culture (allbeit limited). On further investigation I discovered the huge controversy that has surrounded this book, and Ms Morgans admission that it was a hoax. Does it matter if the details are incorrect. Yes it does. Because it is portraying an erroneous image of a nations indigenous people. The cross between Native American Indians and aboriginal mythology is obvious, and the disregard for the importance of secret men and womens business is against all aboriginal law. Legal campaigns have been mounted, and if one good thing has come out of this, it has galvanised the aboriginal community into action. <BR>A wall of shame has been established and this book is but yet another of many entries. Meanwhile Ms Morgan travels the world, giving lectures and pretending to be an authority on a culture that she has no knowledge of. <BR>Marlo May you hang your head in shame.
6300214540|4.0|I'm 15 and have just seen Top Gun for the first time.  It was a great movie.  It starts off with heartthrob Tom Cruise working his way through pilot school and hoping to be TOP GUN the best pilot.  Along the way he is faced with some competition.  He is also at work to impress the girl of his dreams.  Will Maverick (Cruise) win the girl and be Top Gun or will he be defeated?  I guess you'll have to watch this excellent film and see for yourself.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The soul and authenticity that's pouring out of his album &quot;Room For Squares&quot; is absolutely incredible.  Far from the main-stream and media-produced records, John Mayer's sound is truly refreshing and innovative.  The CD itself is brilliant(one of the best I've heard in ages), not to mention the &quot;aww-shucks&quot; and charismatic qualities of Mayer, which makes his fans adore him even more.  Also, the energy and heart that he puts in his shows is unbelievable.  It's no wonder that 96,000 fans showed up to catch his astonishing performance at Centennial Park in Atlanta Georgia a couple weeks ago, which was the largest gathering ever to take place in the park's history, surpassing the Olympics.  And there's definitely no doubt that Mayer will be making history of his own soon.  I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed with this album.  It is genuinely amazing.
6303109950|5.0|Tombstone is not your usual country western movie.  It has action, thrills, love and all the other elements of a great movie.  This is one of the few westerns that I can actually sit through and watch with enjoyment.  As soon as I purchace this mvoie I know I will find myself watching is over and over again!!
B00006690F|5.0|Eminem proves once again that he is or close to the best lyrical rapper in the game today.
B00000490M|5.0|Karate Kid is by far one of the best films ever produced.  The movie starts out with Daniel moving from New Jersey to California with his mom.  While trying to fit in at school and win a girls heart (Ali) Daniel learns that he must use karate.  He finds a friend in Mr. Myagi while he teaches Daniel the basics of martial arts.  Now Daniel must prove that he is truely the best around and nothing can keep him down and also earn some respect from his new peers.  THIS MOVIE IS GREAT FOR ANYONE!!  You'll love it!
0783226063|5.0|Though the book does not develop all the threads in this epic (as others have pointed out), the movie is faithful to Paul and as a whole did a great job of describing the characters and the universe of Arrakis.  <BR> <BR>Many found the movie confusing. My only answer to that is to read and re-read the books until you find yourself in the Dune universe. The movie makes perfect sense to one thus familiar. <BR> <BR>Imagine trying to understand the \\"Ten Commandments\\" without ever having grown up with the myths and legends of the 'Bible'. The movie would have been just as confusing. <BR> <BR>Great book, great movie!...
0780626478|1.0|Blast from the Past is one of the worst films I've ver seen.  I tried to watch is several time and it would not keep my attention it was so poor.  Finally i forced myself to watch the whole film and was dumbfounded at how Hollywood would actually allow this film to be produced.  Don't waste you time on this jumk!!
0140186395|5.0|This is the most interesting book I have ever read. Slow paced and somewhat unorganized, yet the book presents powerful and unique characters, making the book even more intriguing.  Adam and Charles and Aron and Caleb recreate the old Biblical story of Cain and Abel. Battling between the choice of good or evil, the characters allow themselves to shape their lives. Therefore, Timshel or thou mayest, the power of choice, is the most important underlying theme in this book. The choice helps characters to reflect oneself and to mature by recognizing their own mistakes. Read this book! I strongly recommend it.  And learn how to make right choices, which could change your life.
B00005JKED|4.0|The plot of this movie, while absolutely compelling, might have seemed too far-fetched if not for the brilliant performances of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.  Washington is utterly convincing as a cop gone bad; he truly deserved an Oscar for this role. Ethan Hawke, meanwhile, gives a tough, impressive performance as a young cop who gradually realizes his new boss (Washington) is irredeemably corrupted.  Not all the reviews for this movie were laudatory, but I urge you to watch it for yourself and make up your own mind.  One reviewer on this page complains that the movie is not suitable for viewers under age 18, and that it's too violent.  Well, of course it's not suitable for young viewers--that's why it's rated R.  And it's violent because it's realistically depicting violent parts of L.A.  If you can't take it, as Washington himself says in the film, \\"go back to the Valley.\\"  If you can, you'll probably be engrossed by \\"Training Day\\" and its fine actors.
0446678430|2.0|I loved Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and it definitely inspired my entire family, but I didn't get much out of RY,RR. It seems to be much of the same encouragement. I think one or the other would suffice. If you own Rich Dad, Poor Dad, just reread it.
B000002J1I|2.0|1978 was basically the beginning of the end of the prog rock scene. Bands were either running out of fresh ideas or record companies, who were really starting to tighten up to the point where sales were top priority, forced these bands to record more radio-friendly material at the expense of artistic creativity. The punk and disco scene at the time didn't help. 1978 wasn't a good year for prog. ELP gave us Love Beach, which is regarded, almost universally, as one of the worst albums from a prog band anywhere. Genesis released And Then There Were Three, which, at least isn't bad, but the creativity of the albums they did from 1970-1977 has been lost. Gentle Giant gave us Giant For a Day, which is considered an embarassment by the fans (I hadn't heard that one, but I'm familiar with this era of Gentle Giant as being rather straightforward and song-oriented because I do have 1977's The Missing Piece and 1980's Civilian). American Yes copycats Starcastle gave us Real to Reel which is regarded by their fans as a commercial and AOR disaster. What about the real Yes? Well they gave us Tormato, which I think was their worst 1970s album. It was albums like Tormato that gave more fuel to the fire by the punk rockers that prog rock was bloated, self-indulgent, and pretentious. I even admit that not every prog rock album out there is a gem, but I've had the best experience collecting prog over any other genre. I am not so bothered that the songs on Tormato are shorter (remember, their first two albums, from 1969-70, were decent enough and didn't have side-length epics and the songs were 3-7 minutes long). I am more bothered by the messy quality of the album. By this time, Rick Wakeman's trustworthy Mellotron and Minimoogs were gone, in favor of rather ugly, plastic-sounding synths, more '80s sounding than '70s. He was playing a Birotron, which was basically a Mellotron powered by 8-tracks, rather than the old tape rack. Many of the compositions just fall flat. There's \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\", which has a fine environmental message to the music, but the music just simply doesn't do justice. The worst one is \\"Circus of Heaven\\", which is perhaps the most unbearable song I have ever heard Yes done. Real cheesy, and add that with a circus pipe organ certainly doesn't help the situation. And near the end, Jon Anderson had his son do some spoken dialog. \\"Release, Release\\" is a poor attempt at Yes doing arena rock. It rocks, I can't deny that, but the lyrics are full of really bad AOR/stadium rock cliches. There several shorter songs, listenable enough, but nothing remarkable. But at least the album isn't a total washout. \\"On the Silent Wings Of Freedom\\" is a total prog rock masterpiece, and is truly worth it for this cut alone. If the album was full of great cuts like this one, I would have regarded this album as a classic. But the way things are, I just find this album messy. I think the album was more an attempt to please the record company than the fans. After all, the music lovers in charge of these companies had left, in favor of more faceless corporate suits and ties. Although many might disagree, I actually liked their following album, Drama, better, even though Anderson and Wakeman were gone. For me, Tormato is basically for Yes completists, and in my opinion, the stuff Yes did from 1971-1977 was their best era.
B00001OH7O|4.0|In contrast to David's more typical, livelier work with frequent heavy instrumental layers, Hunky Dory is generally mellow and relatively sparse instrumentally, occasionally marked by acoustic guitar and piano standing alone.  Still, it has one great rocker in &quot;Queen Bitch,&quot; with Mick Ronson's roaring guitar.  &quot;Changes&quot; is a solid pop standard.  David also does a characteristic melodramatic number (&quot;Life on Mars&quot;), which employs orchestral sounds, and it is one of the strongest tracks.  &quot;Kooks&quot; is often seen as a lightweight and inconsequential, but to me it is an amusing, catchy inclusion, and its lyrics focusing on David's son and school involve me more than the interesting ones contemplating Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol.  Indeed, the lyrics throughout Hunky Dory are eccentric, poetic, and intriguing, and the album's softer side helps hone one's focus on them, as does the good quality of the music. Hunky Dory offers a glimpse into the lighter side of David.
038533558X|4.0|I discovered this author with last year's &quot;Tell no one&quot; which then prompted me to go to the library and check out all the other books by the same author.  His style for the Myron Bolitar novels is less sinister and more witty, but all his books leave you in suspense and are very well plotted and written.  Not one of those books where you know the killer by chapter two!<BR>This new book, Gone for Good, is about the unravelling life of Will Klein who struggles to move beyond the fact that his beloved, elder bro, Ken, allegedly killed Will's first love.<BR>The book is dark, suspenseful and totally thrilling.  Each twist and turn leaves you reeling, gasping, and wanting more.<BR>I definitely recommend this book.  Coben has an amazing way of keeping the story going until the very last word!<BR>Enjoy..
B00000IAU3|4.0|But I couldn't quite give her 3 stars. I agree with the Amazon.com reviewer that she is a blend of Sarah McLachlan, Sinead O'Connor and Beth Orton but her lyrics are not as open as Sinead's and not as in depth and spiritual as Sarah's. Dido and her brother, Rollo (What were her parents thinking?) did a solid job producing and writing most of the album especially for a debut. <br />The best songs are \\"Here with Me\\", with its cinematic studio-produced orchestra, \\"Thank You\\", we've all heard it on the radio about a million times, \\"Honestly OK\\", which has a perfect match of techno and soft music, \\"Isobel\\", and \\"Slide\\". \\"My Life\\" is alright but it would have been better as complete jazz song instead of settling for just a jazz feel. I really like \\"Take My Hand\\" but the fast dance/techno beat distracts from what could have been a beautiful epic. They should have turned down the production level and opted for a live orchestra instead. Other than that, it's an overall good cd and Dido is a promising artist.
B00002Z88D|4.0|Although it's been done before, there is no problem with it being done again. If the idea keeps being repeated, it must be working, and in this album, it does. <br />BEAUTIFUL is a word that almost does it justice. The music is so big,  and the juxtapostion of soft and hard is interesting and at times breathtaking.<br />But like I say, So What? Who cares if it's been done before.<BR>My favorites are The Memory Remains, Call of the Ktulu, No Leaf Clover, Nothing Else Matters<br />Buy the CD, you have nothing to lose except a bit of money but you have the opportunity to gain 2 CDs of quality music.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Most of the songs are exactly like the versions sung in the film (&quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Your Song&quot;, &quot;El Tango de Roxanne&quot;). Some songs are better than the film versions with pop stars participating like the huge hit &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;. The only problem I had was with &quot;Come What May&quot; because instead of the dramatic, touching finale that it was in the film, they went with full blown production and turned it into a run-of-the-mill duet. This soundtrack is good as a companion to the movie not a replacement. The music in the film is the most exciting because of the story, acting, setting, etc. that goes along with it while you're watching the movie.
B000002J1X|4.0|&quot;Time And A Word&quot; is one of the most underrated Yes albums, made at a time when they were still young, fresh and ready to rock.  The jazz and classical influence becomes more prominent, although their sound was still formative and would fully gel on the next album, &quot;The Yes Album&quot;.  Nonetheless, there's some good stuff here and on a recent re-listen I found myself enjoying nearly every track.  The obvious weak point, noted by most reviewers, is the orchestra, which is added to most of the songs and does not quite mix with the group's basic sound.  This proved to be the case with all of the orchestral-rock albums released that year, a list that also included works by Deep Purple, The Nice and Pink Floyd.  All of those artists would soon learn how to best express themselves through the use of a wider array of keyboards, although on &quot;Time And A Word&quot; the string backing works OK on the ballad &quot;Clear Days&quot; and the anthemic title track.<br />Not surprisingly, the two best songs are those without the orchestra, and they point squarely to the sound devoloped for the upcoming &quot;Yes Album&quot;--&quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; is a strong, melodic pop-rock song with an uplifting chorus, while the slightly psychedelic &quot;Astral Traveller&quot; features the soon-to-be trademark &quot;cosmic&quot; lyrics and complex instrumental interplay that would make them famous.  &quot;Astral Traveller&quot; would even improve in live performance after Steve Howe joined the group, and is a song the band should reconsider adding to their live setlist (they have periodically reprised &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; and the title track over the years).<br />&quot;Time And A Word&quot; is upbeat, positive music that stands in stark contrast to the music being made by today's youth.  It was made by a band just coming out of the radical changes induced by the 60s and about to refine it into a classic progressive sound for the 70s.  As such, it is a worthwhile historical curiosity--and might surprise you with a few good tunes in the bargain.  You just can't beat the jazzy drumming, rumbling bass, hammond organ and clear-toned guitar stylings that marked their sound at this time, and of course if you like this you should love &quot;The Yes Album&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close To The Edge&quot;.
B00005T30L|5.0|The characters in this movie are so real in their actions and their views of the world, that you have to spot at least one person you know in real life who are like on of the characters. Enid is a continuation of Thora Birch's character in American Beauty as she and her best friend, Rebecca played Scarlett Johansson, snidely remark on fellow citizens, pop culture and their surroundings. The film injects humour, sarcasm and wit into everyday deeds such as summer school, jobs, and going to the video store. It sort of like &quot;High Fidelity&quot; with teenage girls. The girls are outsiders by choice and Enid would rather hang out with older recluses than to go against her morals by following the in crowd. My favorite line from the film is at the beginning where a girl who has been in an accident is giving a graduation speech and...well, you need to hear it for yourself. I highly recommend this movie.
B00005YW4H|5.0|How can some of these reviewers say that the music of Norah Jones is anything less than amazing?  Breathing, intonation....what is that?  That reminds me of Olympic diving commentators (who have never actually been in the water, mind you) who critique every little aspect of a seemingly perfect dive.  This music is unquestionably simple and jazzy and fantastic.  New to Jones's style of music, I had only heard a few of the songs when I bought the CD, but now I am glad to say that I am addicted.  I can't pick a favorite song because they are all so wonderful.  Get it...you won't be disappointed, regardless of what those other people are telling you.
0345404475|4.0|The only thing I didn't like was how fast I read it. Coming in at about 250 pages, its a quick read. Only took about 2 days to finish. Like other movies based on books, this book is alot better than the movie. The movie left out alot of things that would of been great to see on the big screen.<br />This is my first PKD book, but rest assure I'm on my way to buy some more of them.
0553212443|5.0|A few days back, I read in an article on Leo Tolstoy's \\"What is art?\\" that he quoted, as examples of the highest works of art, Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol\\" along with other works such as Friedrich Schiller's \\"The Robbers\\" , Victor Hugo's \\"Les Miserables\\" and Dickens' \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\". Since I've read these three - and since all of them are my favorites, I decided to hunt out all the books recommended by Tolstoy, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" being the first of those recommended, which I hadn't read before.<br />Believe me this short novel didn't let me down. I wouldn't call it as great as \\"Les Miserables\\" or \\"The Robbers\\", but it perfectly fits into Tolstoy's main criteria of a great work of art - that which :<BR>1.Flows from man's love for God and for man.<BR>2.Unites people in the common, universal feelings of mankind and in such a manner as to lead to the betterment of human society.<br />Tolstoy stressed on the moral content of a work of art - and on the emotional impact it makes on the reader - on its relevance and effectiveness in leading to a better world. <BR>Considering these points, \\"A Christmas carol\\" is certainly an excellent novel.<br />The theme of this novel, I'd put as: \\"A man's discovery of the joy in giving.\\"<br />Dickens', it seems, meant the novel to have a \\"social conscience\\" - exhorting the rich and amply endowed to look after the poor and wretched - to fight ignorance and want.<BR>But he achieves much more than this - <BR>1. This is a novel about the regeneration and rebirth of a man's soul - a man's return to innocence.<BR>2. This novel clearly shows that man is never beyond redemption -that it is never too late to make atonements for one's past misdeeds. As long as there is a will and a future - man can always strive for the achievement of higher values.<BR>3. Above all, this is (almost)the ONLY novel which radiates a sense of joy, benevolence and goodwill towards mankind which would endear it to any reader.<br />The way Dickens has poked fun at the wrong and the erroneous, blending this critical attitude with a cheerful, benign humor is an exceptional achievement in itself, for it avoids bitterness & unhealthy sarcasm - and, while the seriousness of the subject is maintained, makes the reader smile all the way from the begining to the end of the story.<br />The way in which he has captured the SPIRIT of Christmas is wonderful - I never knew that Dickens could write like this. Moreover, Dickens is not concerned with religious dogma or the scriptures or Christmas day as such - but has gone straight to the essence of the Christian philosophy and has attempted to show its beneficent consequences on men's lives. He has used this day as a medium for understanding and appreciating all that it stands for ; the wider moral and social principles are his concern - as should be, for any writer of stature.<br />I'd conclude this review by saying that it is my heartiest and most earnest wish and request to not just the readers of this review but to every person in this world - be a child, be full of benevolence, mutual respect and compassion that you may be joyful and radiate joy and laughter too, to all of you out there - make EVERY day of yours a merry Christmas - and may your life be full of the bliss and goodwill this day brings to men - as has been so beautifully brought out by this delightful novel.<br />MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
6305781427|5.0|I would have loved to have been there.  This concert's CD was my introduction to Yanni's wonderful compositions, especially the powerful &quot;Within Attraction&quot;, and so this DVD purchase was the next logical step.<br />The presentation, ambiance and emotion of the performances are wonderful, and I've watched selected pieces repeatedly.<br />The only detractor, which isn't a problem with the DVD, is the concert lighting itself.  Contiguous walls of the Acropolis are oftentimes illuminated with red against blue lighting.  This lighting effect, whether viewed on TV/video/DVD, comes across far too loud.<br />No such detractor, ultimately, can keep this concert from a 5 star rating.

B0000035E7|5.0|bleach is not nirvana's best work by any means, nor is kurt's songwriting as good as nevermind or in utero, but the album succeeds through its energy, its sincerity, and the adventurous nature of the songs.  kurt adds an element of originality to each song, and he wasnt afraid to go in different directions in his songwriting.  <BR>BLEW- IMO, this song is the real prelude to nevermind, in that it manages to be both heavy and melodic at the same time<BR>FLOYD THE BARBER- a very primitive, heavy song; they take a two chord riff and make it huge, i love kurt's scream at the end of the first chorus, this one has very good lyrics that tell a story in which the townsfolk in the andy griffith show are all deranged murderers<BR>ABOUT A GIRL- standout track that highlights kurt's natural pop songwriting ability<BR>SCHOOL- bleach's first big anthem; it only has 3 different lines, yet they are sung with the utmost passion, worked really well when played live<BR>LOVE BUZZ- cover of a 60's psychadelic pop song, a very good performance with a crazy noise solo<BR>PAPER CUTS- with its lurching rhythm, dissonant chord progression, and seriously frightening vocals, this is probably the most intense song on the record; this song has the most thought-out lyrics, and they are definitely the most disturbing; this track also shows kurt's versatility as a vocalist<BR>NEGATIVE CREEP- another one of bleach's big anthems, this is probably the 2nd most intense song on the album; in the first verse kurt sings in a gruff bark, but by the end of the second he's screaming at the top of his lungs<BR>SCOFF- has a great 70's type drumbeat during the verse; kurt sings the line &quot;gimme back my alcohol&quot; in a different voice practically each time<BR>SWAP MEET- sort of has a weird rhythm in the verses, the vocals are set against the guitars in a weird way that you dont expect  at the beginning<BR>MR. MUTSTACHE- one of the more upbeat songs on the record with great anti-hipster lyrics, love how they slow the main riff down to a crawl at the end<BR>SIFTING- has a macho zeppelin-like feel to it, very strange lyrics and a structure similar to scoff's<BR>BIG CHEESE- great intro guitar noise; the gruff, snarling vocals during the verses contrast with the mellow choruses, <BR>DOWNER- great energetic closer, kurt sings in a bizarre voice during the verses, indecipherable lyrics
6305657947|4.0|A sly little caper, &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; is visually lush, adventurous fun, with a strong performance by Rene Russo as the hard-shelled insurance investigator chasing Pierce Brosnan's suave art thief.  Faye Dunaway contributes an amusing cameo (she played the Russo role in the original film with Steve McQueen), and the music and art direction are outstanding.  &quot;Thomas Crown&quot; is light Friday-night entertainment that you just might want to watch again (and again!).
B00005RFAI|1.0|I bought this CD for my daughter's 8th birthday as she is a pink fan.  She hears one of the songs on the radio and really likes it.  Before I gave it to her, I opened it so I could see if the lyrics were included.  They were, and I was horrified.  I thought warning stickers were placed on CD's for language content.  In any case, if you're buying this for a child you should know the language in some of the songs is pretty low class.  I don't know about you, but I don't want my kid dropping the &quot;F&quot; word into conversation thinking that's acceptable because she heard it in a song.
B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel Washington contributes a powerhouse, Oscar-winning performance as Alonzo Harris, the crooked cop of Antoine Fuqua's \\"Training Day.\\"  He is, however, one of only many reasons to catch this film, an intelligent, thought-provoking study of morality and the line between good and evil.  Ethan Hawke, in an Oscar-nominated role, is effective as the conflicted rookie who finds himself in awe of Harris' power and street philosophy, while at the same time being reviled by his actions.  \\"Training Day\\" is gruesome, but worthwhile.  It'll cause you to think about it long after the credits end, as any good film should.
B0000640SA|5.0|Buy this DVD. <BR>Any reviewers who want to lead you to believe that you should not buy this version of the DVD do not have the brain capacity to understand the basic plot of the movie if they cannot comprehend the underlying simplicity of the DVD menus. Those who claim that they have wasted &quot;hours of their time&quot; simply trying to play this DVD..... i am speechless. I own both editions of Memento on DVD and the l.e is far superior. With the additional evaluation of such added materials such as production notes, sketches, theatrical trailers, hbo documentaries and much much more, the benefits derived from the l.e. supercede the 5 or 10 seconds it may take to use the new, improved, and super cool new menus. <BR>A great movie and wonderful edition, dont be fooled.
B00005QCYC|5.0|JP - The first one in the trilogy and the best. Great story of a park gone mad.<BR>TLW:JP - Sequel about man trying to control nature. Seeing T.rex in San Diego is wonderful.<BR>JP3 - The latest installment to the trilogy. Great action and suspense.<BR>Bonus disc has some nice info and stuff that JP fanatics will love. Hopefully there will be more movies added to this all in all great trilogy.
0452282152|5.0|This story is a captivating novel with everything I look for.  Romance, conspiracy, art; this is one of my favorite books and I recommend this to any teen-adult willing to put up a few days to read it.
0312243022|5.0|Michael Cunningham seamlessly blends the premise to \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" while adding in his own elements, creating a book that is both a pleasure to read while thought provoking. I had not read anything of his before, but was led to it after reading literature by Virginia Woolf. I was blown away not only by the images he was able to evoke, but by his ability to create a storyline that allows the reader to become hooked into it, no matter how distant the premise was. He manages to connect and relate the three women without using the usual and obviuos ploys. Highly recommended!
B00003CXAA|4.0|Part I: 5 stars<BR>Part II: 5 stars<BR>Part III: an overly generous 2 stars<br />Nothing needs to be said about the first two movies, except that this is one of those very rare instances in which the sequel may be even better than the original (the only other example that comes to mind being &quot;Superman II&quot; -- also written by Mario Puzo!).<br />But Part III!  Oh, is it bad.  Is it embarrassing.  I was prepared, too: I was all ready to watch a movie that wasn't going to live up but would be good on its own merits.  Instead I saw Part III.<br />I don't even want to talk about it.<br />The DVD Collection is worth getting anyway, but don't even bother watching Part III.  What a waste.  And of course that's the reason that you can't buy the movies individually: no one in his right mind would ever buy the third one on its own.  Buy the set, and then use the Part III DVD as a coaster.
0140288503|4.0|Black Hawk Down is an exhaustive and exhausting account of the disastrous end of the 1993 U.N. peacekeeping mission in Mogadishu, Somalia. Providing a concise political context for the mission, the book chronicles, minute by harrowing minute, the desperate attempts to rescue the Ranger and Delta Force soldiers trapped in the city.<br />Bowden does a remarkable job of painting the troops, their commanders, and the situation with precision and clarity, while also providing instructive Somalian viewpoints. If occasionally so over-detailed that it becomes difficult to follow, Black Hawk Down still manages the nearly impossible feat of recreating the chaotic battle as riveting and thought provoking narrative.
B00005T30L|2.0|I really didn't care much for this movie. First off, i cant imagine it is easy to make a movie based on a Graphic Novel.<br />I found the story to be very dull, and the main character (enid i think her name is) is extreemly annoying.  The movie, to me, is set around her feeling sorry for herself, and whinning a whole lot.<br />There are parts of the movie that i did like however.  I loved all the Art Class scenes i thought those were hilarious.<br />I give it two stars, because it wasnt the worst move i have ever seen, and like i said i did like the art class scenes.
B00005K3OT|3.0|This movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.  If you like midly funny movies you would like this one.  I watched it mainly because I am a huge Johnny Depp fan.  It wasn't one of the best movies I have seen but also not the worst.  I would say it was midly humorus. kinda bordering on blah.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|Hello? It's Star Wars. 'Nuff said.
6301247485|4.0|I watched this movie today for the first time since I originally saw it, back in'74. I think it plays better now than it did then - it had to really - back then, there was so much hype surrounding it that it was inevitable that one would come away from the theatre feeling a little disappointed. I was one of those people.<BR>Today, Redford is still impressive and Sam Waterston and Scott Wilson are outstanding. Sadly, Mia Farrow's Daisy is just as irritating as she ever was. But, is this Mia's fault, or Scott Fitzgerald's ? After all, aren't ALL his heroines eminently slap-able ???<br />The main problem with this video release is however, the deletion of most of Nelson Riddle's brilliant score. Riddle used Irving Berlin's song &quot;What'll I Do&quot; as his main theme and interpolated it (to great effect)throughout the movie. The movie was made long before the days of home video,DVD,etc. So, when Paramount wanted to release the movie on video, the Irving Berlin estate said &quot;Hang on a minute, we only licensed the song for theatrical release. Nobody said anything about a video release. If you want to use our song in your video, you have to pay us another zillion (I exagerate- but you get the idea!) dollars for the priviledge&quot;. Naturally, Paramount said &quot;No way !&quot;.<BR>That is why we have this bowdlerised video, and why we have no DVD, or CD release. Although in the latter case, there is the added complication of the soundtrack being released on the now defunct Paramount label. So, if you still have your original LP's and Cassette Tape copies of the Soundtrack, hang on to them. They are much sought after.<BR>If anyone from the Berlin/Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein organization reads this, please be a Sport and give us the original movie back..pretty please.<BR>In the meantime,enjoy what's left of this entertaining movie, but DO read the book. It's somewhat better !
B00005A0V0|4.0|In the Land of Grey and Pink seems to have a bit of an identity crisis. Don't get me wrong, its an excellent album, but its not what you would expect from a progressive rock group. Nine Feet Underground and Winter Wine definitely fall within the latter category and Golf Girl and Love to Love You is definetly catchy pop tunes. The title track falls somewhere inbetween. While I normally prefer progressive music, on this album the pop tunes really shine. Winter Wine is also an excellent song, but, as with many progressive tunes, you find that you like some parts of it more than others. In this case, the first half is far superior to the second. I normally like extended tracks, but Nine Feet Underground doesn't impress me that much. The title track grows on you but I think the surreal lyrics are much more interesting that the tune. Overall, its a good, if flawed album. It has some moments of brilliance and other moments of mediocrity.
0446677450|4.0|The storytelling can be long winded, but the ideas are valid.  Kiyosaki explores the way the rich THINK about money and how it works for them.  His explanation of assets (puts money in your pocket) and liabilities (takes money out or your pocket) was interesting and made me think. Financial education is the focus of this book, in terms of how money works and how the tax system in the United States &quot;directs&quot; how the rich play the money game.<br />Kiyosaki doesn't provide any &quot;how to&quot; advice, leaving that for his &quot;Investment&quot; book.  He pushes how one must change their thinking if they truly desire to become rich. This book was worth reading, but to achive any of this, it seems more reading is in order. :)
0399226907|5.0|This book has been a favorite of mine since childhood. I just purchased a copy in order to share some special memories with my baby. It is a super book written in a simple style about a very hungry caterpillar and teaches numbers and the lifecyle of a butterfly. The board book has holes in the pages to encourage the child to touch the book and count along.<br />This is a classic and it will always have a special place on my bookshelf.
0553381709|4.0|I was tough on Martin's 1st book, giving it only 3 stars.  Well, his 3rd effort had me reading 100 pages a day.  I couldn't put it down.<br />Martin has such a knack for making characters you can care about.  I find myself liking the Lannisters as much as I like the Starks, and there are not any characters whose fate I'm bored by.  (Unlike Robert Jordan, where I find I skip a lot of Nynaeve chapters :)).<br />Martin is also deft in his handling of a rather intricate plot.  His world is not as politically diverse as Jordan's, but I think the story benefits from this.  His pacing and timing are fabulous, and there was never a time I felt the plot dragging.  Martin is driving us toward a thundering climax, and he keeps us on our toes with his numerous clever twists.<br />Epic fantasy has suffered so much from the formulaic plots and paper-doll characters of many of the authors that it's been hard to stay with the genre.  Only a few authors have broken the mold; Jordan with his Wheel of Time, Tad Williams with Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, and Martin is well on his way with his Song of Ice and Fire.<br />There is only one thing that kept me from giving five stars for this book.  Martin's characters often use vulgar language and there are some moments of descriptive sexuality that I think are unnecessary.  Thus 4 stars instead of five.<br />The last caveat:  I'm sick of waiting for the next book to come out!  I've been waiting for Jordan's books since the 9th grade when I started reading them.  I'm 25 now.  Will I still be around to finish the series?<br />All that said, A Storm of Swords was a great read and highly recommended.
B00003CXI1|2.0|With the space limitation it would be impossible for me to tell everything that's wrong with the Harry Potter movie, but if you're a die-hard fan like me then I'm sure you already know. From bad special effects (the troll, the centaur), a disjointed screenplay (Why do H,H,and R first discover Fluffy in the apparent afternoon, but by the time they get back to the dormitory scurry off to bed?), choppy editing (That cut to the hut-on-the-rock scene is appalling and the music is overbearing throughout the film.), and bad directing (could *someone* have told Emma she didn't have to enunciate everything?!) the movie really could've of been much better.<BR>Of course the truth is that it's Harry so I can't help but at least liking it. The sets may've been quite good, I'll admit, but the spirit of the books just wasn't there. The movie is worth it only if you're a fan, but if you're just discovering Harry do focus on the books and not this mediocre bit of celluloid.<BR>On a related note, I've still not figured out how exactly to watch the extra footage, or even if it's on my DVD, though apparently it is, and I'm fed up with trying. I don't find it amusing that I have to work through a (very) poorly constructed \\"game\\" just to view extra footage.<br />All in all my advice is to go read the book (again and again)!
0788811355|3.0|I hate to sound flip about a movie that made such an impressive sweep of the Academy Awards, but this film could best be described as \\"The Elephant Man meets Lawrence of Arabia.\\" Perhaps I was expecting too much because of all the media hype and the awards.<br />The other thing that got hyped about the movie was the spectacular cinematography. I can only assume this was because of all the shots involving Kristen Scott Thomas's bare breasts.<br />For example, there are shots of Thomas's breasts with a Morrocan courtyard in the background, of her breasts with the Morrocan desert in the background, and of her breasts with a Moroccan interior in the background. I guess Morroco is so flat that Thomas's breasts are the only mountains to be seen in this vast expanse of desert.<br />I agree, Thomas has very nice breasts, and I would even say they are tastefully and even artfully presented in the movie, but this is not enough to qualify a movie as having great cinematography, either. Her breasts almost got enough play in the movie to deserve an extra screen credit by themselves.<br />However, not to completely bash the movie, there are some beautiful and even spectacular shots of the Morrocan landscape (or wherever it got filmed), and the complex story line with its flashbacks backward and forward in time is not without interest. Ralph Fiennes and Binoche gave fine performances, especially Fiennes, who really deserved the Academy award more than Binoche, but I thought Thomas was somewhat miscast in her role.<br />The movie is also too long and drags in too many places. Overrall I expected more from a movie that got so much hype and media attention--no doubt that should have been a warning to me. But the movie wasn't bad. I give it high marks for cinematography and some of the acting, but overall I can't rate it higher than about three and a half stars.
B00005YW4H|3.0|...but don't stay too long or else you'll drift into la la land...<br />Norah Jone's debut album, COME AWAY WITH ME is definitely overrated and overhipped by critics and fans alike but the voice is what makes it half acceptable. It's silky smooth yet jadded and rough; relaxing yet strong and steamy. She can be compared to the likes of Eva Cassidy and Billie Holiday but that's a little over the top, if you ask me, despite my praises of her gorgeous voice. She's destined for great things (which is a little prediction of mine) but she's honestly no different from any other jazz or blues singer I've heard in my years, which makes her an unlikely candidate for becoming a legend. Songs like \\"Nightingale\\" (which is a soothingly lulling songs) and \\"Shoot The Moon\\" (a soultry song to possess your hearing) show her true promise with delicate guitar/piano playing and contemporary jazz beats that are utterly breathtaking. As I write this review I'm actually listening to those two songs on repeat, and despite the fact that I've played them about 6 times through now I'm still not tired of them...<br />Everyone keeps raving about her re-make of Hank William's \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" but I honestly don't fathom the fuss. It's dullfully boring and I don't even think that I'd want to listen to it to help induce me to sleep. I've never before heard the original version but I'm hoping that it's better than this...<br />The whole album is very meditative and subtle but that's where it loses its edge and starts its tragic downfall. The songs pretty much sound the same with no real depth or range, and that's where it loses my interest and patience. I don't mean to entirely diss this album but I'm speaking the truth (in my own opinion) and it's really not worth the money. Buy it used if you have to but first consider something by Diana Krall before spending your hard-earned cash on this (not horrible album) but tiresomely bland album. An upbeat song or two would have probably saved this dreamy concoction from becoming average, but there's always a next time so hopefully she'll then losen up a little. This isn't entirely jazz so she should fuse some more influences into this coffee-house soundscape that's unfortunately repetitive.y concoction from becoming average, but there's always a next time so hopefully she'll then losen up a little.

B00005JKJA|1.0|I give this 1 star only because there is no option to give it a big round zero.  I admit I should have been forewarned when the description stated nudity was involved, but I foolishly tried it anyway.  As I discovered, the words \\"nudity\\" and \\"language\\" and \\"violence\\", etc. did not prepare me for what I was going to see.  The only reason I watched it to the end was because I kept waiting to see what the punch line was.  Never got it--until later when I realized it was nothing more than an expose of the evils and corruptions of man, who seem to be portrayed as victims who cannot escape being pulled down into and doomed by corruption.  How absolutely hideous, and sad.  No sense of morality or goodness or beauty or love or even a purpose, not even one of those more and more often lost attributes of a good story. Nothing even in the remotest sense of the word redeeming.  Even fun was missing.<br />All these reviewers who see hidden meanings to be fathomed by those who are intelligent enough don't mention the utter depravity.  Yes, that is my opinion just as they have their opinions, and I guess anyone can put any interpretation he dreams up on anything.  The way I see it is that if Lynch's point was not to portray man \\"helplessly\\" falling into his own garbage, then he was simply dumping HIS garbage on the unsuspecting public.  I give him credit for one thing only:  his ability to keep one strung along in the hopes of a resolution.  <br />Now, regarding the plot itself, making connections must be a foreign concept to Lynch.  Most, if not all, events that take place are not connected to anything and are never resolved. A glaring example is the two women, one who has lost her memory after escaping death and the other who ends up dead, or was dead all along. As for the characters, I would not want to imagine that anyone like any of them could exist even in someone's mind.  But I have not seen the darkest corners of the world.  The dark corners of my own world are plenty darkenough for me.<br />The reviewer who said it doesn't take being intellectual to understand this movie was exactly right.  It just takes the realization that you are being pulled into hell. Lynch's game-playing is sick.  To those who want to be twisted and turned and manipulated, I recommend a movie like \\"The Game\\".  That involves a joke that could even be considered cruel, but at least it's entertaining and does not end with the sunk feeling that you're in hell and can't escape.  It has a point to it, and it is even fun to watch.  These concepts most of all escape Lynch in Mulholland Drive.
B000002KYK|1.0|This imitation soundtrack is awful.  I was mislead, as I thought this was the real thing.  Not until I read the fine print/understood the marketing doublespeak did I realize this is just a bad cover.  There are 2 songs on here that sound like something from the movie.  The rest sounds like something from somewhere else.  Save your money and buy the real thing.  Vangelis had nothing to do with this.
B00006690F|4.0|THERE ARE VERY POWERFUL AND MEANINGFUL SONGS ON EMIMEM'S NEWEST EFFORT. EVERYONE SHOULD LISTEN TO HOW STRONG THESE LYRIC'S ARE. THERE IS NOTHING SLIM OR SHADY HERE, JUST HONESTY. I'M LOOKING FOWARD TO HIS FILM \\"8 MILE\\"  IF IT'S HALF AS DEEP AS THIS ALBUM, IT WILL BE WORTH MY TIME AND MONEY. THE FILM STARS EMIMEM, BRITTANY MURPHY, AND KIM BASINGER FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER. THERE IS AN EXCLUSIVE DVD THAT COMES WITH THE CD THAT HAS THE TRAILER FOR \\"8 MILE\\" ON IT PLUS OTHER RARE LIVE PERFORMANCES. YES, THE MUSIC HERE IS VERY DEEP. HOWEVER THE ARTIST APPROACHES HIS MATERIAL WITH A COMIC POINT OF VIEW. IF YOU NEED TO BE PUT IN YOUR PLACE, HE'LL PUT YOU THERE WITH EASE. OF COURSE THIS ALBUM IS NOT SUGGESTED FOR KIDS, BUT THEY'LL GET THIER HANDS ON IT ANYWAY.
0767853636|4.0|This was such a great movie. I was a child when this came out and at 21 I still enjoy watching it. It has an all-star cast: Carol Burnett (playing a comical, alcoholic Miss Hannigan), Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry, just to name a few. The music is also very catchy and entertaining. This is a great film for children, families and even adults who want to feel like a kid again and it is also by far the best version of \\"Annie\\" to have ever been released!
B00006690G|5.0|This album has it all...the regular Eminem ...talkin disses, Eminem singin, Dr Dre, D-12 and great lyrics. Ever since I have had this CD, it hasn't stoped playing. I personally think that this album is better than his previous 2 solo LP's, the D-12 album and his underground albums also. Below is my track rating (1-5):<br />Curtains Up (Skit): 1 (very short intro)<BR>White America: 5 (expresses Eminem's surprise because of how people feel the same as he does)<BR>Business: 5 (Great song)<BR>Cleanin Out My Closet: 4<BR>Square Dance: 4.5<BR>The Kiss (Skit): 2<BR>Soldier: 5<BR>Say Goodbye To Hollywood: 4.5<BR>Drips: 4<BR>Without Me: 5 (the single, great, like his others)<BR>Paul Rosenberg (Skit): 1<BR>Sing For The Moment: 5<BR>Superman: 5<BR>Hailie's Song: 5++ (EMINEM SINGS!)<BR>Steve Berman (Skit): 1<BR>When The Music Stops: 5<BR>Say What You Say: 5<BR>Till I Collapse: 5<BR>My Dad's Gone Crazy: 5++ (features Hailie)<BR>Curtains Close (Skit): 1
B00005LB9O|3.0|Travis have often been accused of being \\"Radiohead Lite\\", something I don't really have a problem with. I loved The Man Who. It had gorgeous melodies and some real standout songs. This album, however, feels a lot more mellow than their last. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, but most of these songs are forgettable. I do like how the songs flow together really well and how the majority of the tracks connect to the next track. However, this is more background music that anything else. Most of the songs have few distinctive qualities to them and there are not many I feel really stand out.<BR>\\"Afterglow\\" is the best song on this album and my favorite Travis song ever. I'm not totally sure what it is about the song exactly, but it alone is worth the price of the CD. \\"Flowers in the Window\\" is a good song, but can sound a bit worn out after a while. \\"Follow the Light,\\" \\"Sing,\\" \\"The Humpty Dumpty Love Song,\\" and the two hidden tracks are also some of the better songs on the album. And, while they're definetely not known for their great lyrics, \\"Last Train\\" is a really well written song with, I think, some of the best lyrics I've ever heard by them. <BR>My least favorite Travis CD, but that doesn't mean it's bad; just that it's not very memorable.
038533558X|5.0|Eleven years ago, Will Klein's older brother, Ken, disappeared after the rape and murder of a neighborhood girl, Julie, whom Will had once loved.  The police closed the case, sure Ken had done it and gone on the run.  In the Klein family, however, they were sure he was both innocent and dead.  Then, after the death of his mother, Will finds among her effects a 2-year-old photograph of Ken.  Shortly afterwards, Will's girlfriend, Sheila Rogers, disappears suddenly and without a trace.  After Sheila's body is found on a Nebraska roadside, Will travels from New York to attend the funeral in her Midwest home town.  He is shocked to the core when he looks into the casket and realizes he has never seen this woman in his life.  The FBI says her fingerprints belong to Sheila Rogers, so who and where is the Sheila Rogers Will was in love with?<br />There are more twists and turns in this story than you can shake a stick at as it races along at warp speed.  Just when you think you've figured something out, the author throws another curve ball at you, all the way to the final scene.  I tried to read it slowly, and savor it, and make it last, but it was impossible.  This one is a true page-turner.
B00005RYLE|5.0|They're dead.  And they're evil.  They're evil dead.  Pretty well says it all.<br />Bruce Campbell and friends spend a weekend in an out-of-the-way backwoods cabin, where they discover strange artifacts, a black magic grimoire, and a tape-recording by an anthropologist afraid of what he's found.  The anthropologist reads chants from the book onto the tape...and all hell breaks loose.<br />This is the movie Night of the Living Dead wanted to be, and wasn't.  It's the ultimate zombie picture.  Its low-key, low-budget approach works brilliantly.  The suspense has never been bettered, and never lets up.  The film starts out very slowly and quietly, building to fever pitch, and when it jumps out and says \\"boo,\\" it does so to great effect.  It also manages to engage the emotions in ways you wouldn't expect.  Despite the fact that you know it's a movie, it still leaves you feeling terrified and wrung-out, long before the ambiguously unsettling finale.  In addition to the really gruesome decomposition effects, there's an incredible scene in which one of the young women at the cabin is high-speed tracked through the woods, to be overtaken and raped by...a tree.<br />Not for the squeamish, but definitely for zombie-film lovers, and those that enjoy really nail-biting, grimacing horror.
B0000640SA|5.0|This was an amazing movie.  I didn't have a clue what it was about when I bought it.  After watching it, all I have to say is genius.  This movie isn't for the faint of heart.  If you have no attention span, don't buy this movie.  But if you love a movie that challenges you, get this movie.
B00005A1PR|5.0|this cd helped me out when i was very sad and depressed. it made me feel better about myself and helped me see things a bit clearer
B00000DGUG|2.0|So many people loved this album, but I just don't see it. The music is dull and sparse, containing no memorable hooks, and the lyrics just ramble on and on, with no real rhyme. How could this same woman have written Jagged Little Pill only...oh, yeah, and why did she wait so long to release a follow-up? By this point, the world just did not care anymore. And what's with the cover art?<br />The only songs I like are &quot;Unsent&quot; and &quot;One,&quot; but even those don't affect me like any of the tracks on Jagged Little Pill. I kind of wish she'd left out some of these songs and put in &quot;Uninvited&quot; and &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino.&quot; But oh well...hopefully, some of these tunes will come into their own when Alanis performs them in concert. She's awesome to see live, go check her out if you get the chance!
B00004U2A1|5.0|This sequel is virtually identical to its predecessor, even repeating many of the same scenes, yet is different in many regards.  The cinematography is terrific, the production itself really gorgeous:  the film is incredibly colorful, the sets, props and camerawork couldn't be better, and the makeups are as unsettling as those in the first film.<br />The sequel has more of a plot, not that it matters, and actually manages a few very funny bits  -  such as Bruce Campbell's hand acquiring a life of its own, being chopped from his body, and running around behind the walls to occasionally peek out of a mousehole and flip him off, or a mounted deer head on the wall that mockingly laughs at him.  The funniest  -  and perhaps most gruesome  -  thing in the movie is a possessed, grotesquely overweight woman in the cellar, who screeches out, \\"I'll swallow your soul!  I'll swallow your soul!\\" before being bloodily despatched by Campbell.<br />Like the first film, this one ends on an ambiguously unsettling note, but a different one this time  -  which unfortunately set up the silly sequel, Army of Darkness.  Appropriately enough, Evil Dead II is a bridge between the first movie and the third, showing brief moments of the humor that would run rampant in the following film, but more often hewing to the horrific carnage and tense melodrama of the first.<br />You don't have to have seen The Evil Dead to enjoy this movie.  And you don't have to see them in order.  They're both terrific.
0553210246|5.0|Having never read Hardy before, I picked this book at random off a list provided by my Western Civilization teacher.  I can't help but attribute my choice to destiny; this is quite possibly the best book I've ever read, written by the single greatest English author in history.  While some other reviewers have classified his descriptive passages as somewhat dull, I thought they were rather intoxicating; I don't know how one could not enjoy the superbly vivid style Hardy employs.  It's impossible to really describe his writing to one who hasn't read it.<br />The plot in Mayor of Casterbridge is compelling throughout.  I read somewhere that the book was originally published a few chapters at a time in a literary magazine, and this is quite evident, as every many sections seem individually complete with rising action, climax, resolution, etc.  Hardy still manages to integrate these individual sections without flaw and create a wonderful composition of the life of Henchard.  As everyone else has testified, the conclusion of the book is moving beyond description- without a doubt the most affective book I've ever read.  Be forewarned: this is a book that will surely leave the reader in a depressed and brooding state.  Going by Kafka's standard, that a book should be &quot;like a suicide... an axe for the frozen sea within us&quot;, The Mayor of Casterbridge is surely one of just a handful of the great books in English literature.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I have heard nothing but rave reviews of this CD-and as an open-minded music fan I decided to give it a shot. I listened to the entire CD, waiting and waiting for it to start to be wonderful, and that time just never came. Maybe this is one of those CDs that needs a few listens, but the fact is there are way too many other CDs I would rather listen to than this one, so I may never know. As for (seemingly) everyone else in the world who loves this CD and can't get over its brilliance and greatness, I'm happy for you, but I honestly can't see the merits of this album.
0385335482|4.0|Confessions Of A Shop-a-holic reminded me a lot of Bridget Jones' Diary. Becky and Bridget are a lot alike: flaky, funny British women who end up getting their guy. But Bridget is more introspective and reflects on what she's done wrong, and she isn't manipulative like Becky. Also, I couldn't really relate to the character's problem of shopping addiction, because I hate shopping! Especially for clothes. Total misery. But a good point is that a lot of other women (I guess I'm not a typical female) will be able to relate to it.<br />Even though I couldn't relate to her compulsive shopping, this book did get some genuine laughs and cringes from me. Sophie Kinsella has a way of putting you inside the story, so you feel as though you're watching the action.<br />On the downside, Confessions was predictable at times and the light-hearted, fast-paced tone got old. But I would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice distraction book to read, and it really is quite funny. :)
B000002HJD|5.0|Jim Morrison, there is few other's with as much of a mind altering perspective as his.Jim Morrison was a god, a human completely passive at heart allowing anything to happen,and envite anything to happen,  A human of complete expression and love for others. An artist with everything to prove and noone who could stand in his way, He had a alot to prove to the world.And i believe he had more, I believe as he saw the direction of the world, death was the only retreat. American Prayer is of the best of the best, it is true art. Listen as Jim along with his band take you on a tour into Jim's mind. A valuable unique experience. American Prayer is an excellent compilation.
B000002KB8|5.0|Black Sabbath has always been a great influence to the community at large now in the rock music world, and even though now it isn't used quite too properly by many bands, their first album is still, to me, the most rewarding despite so many other immitations and re-toolings.  While the title song itself isn't one of the band's best songs, all the others are way up on the list, inparticular The Wizard, NIB and Wicked World.  For those wanting a repeat listen, or for younger people wanting to dabble in the dark rock region, with a heavy blues mix, disappointment is not in sight in this LP's presence.
B000007MVX|5.0|In 1973 those of us who trekked across Britain to see Tull on tour play this album live were amazed and puzzled. The same concept as &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; but totally different. Was there ever such an introspective album as this (only the &quot;Hare who Lost His Spectacles&quot; being anything like a &quot;performance&quot;)?<br />However we knew that this album never deserved the total and hysterical panning and scorn that the British music press heaped on it at the time (showing that music journalists at least in the UK can't grapple with anything more technically-challenging than &quot;Ballroom Blitz&quot; or &quot;Puppy Love&quot;!).<br />Listening to this album 20 years later, bearing in mind how much music has evolved, you start to realise that this is one of those records that is a milestone of British music and set a standard that few other bands or albums have reached. If it had been released in 1993, the music press would have gone wild!<br />Definitely a precursor for much of rock music that followed it, and it hasn't dated a day.<br />If you don't have this in your music collection, why not?
B00005QXDD|1.0|This is another one of those albums in which the  popularity of it baffles me.  Pretty much every song is the same and is overflowing to the brim with Black's annoying theatrical caterwauling.  As if this wasn't bad enough we also have to hear painfully unfunny lame attempts at comedy between the songs which sounds like they were pulled up at random out of Black's head and since him and his buddy were so stoned, they thought it was the most brilliant and comedically genius thing in the universe.  <br />Mr. Blacks acting was amusing at first in films like Hi-Fidelity, but now he's proven that his comedy is a one note schtick and people are just laughing at him because they remind him of the fat stoner they knew in highschool.  I guess the only plus side of the album is that some of the guitar work is fun to listen to, especially if you're learning how to play the guitar and want to realize how easy it is to write [bad] music.  <BR>Is this the future of comedy?  I hope not.  If you're looking for a funny cd, pick up something by Denis Leary, quite possibly the last great comedian we've had, and now he's busy acting. Please come back and make another cd, Denis.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I've waited decades for this movie and it was worth the wait!<BR>Spider-Man is the greatest comic book movie ever made!<BR>I'm going as far to say that it is as good as Superman 1&2 and Batman!!! (And that's some praise...)<BR>I'm absolutely amazed by how well this movie has been made - full congratulations to everybody involved -<BR>I'm truly \\"web\\"-smacked!!<BR>The entire cast was perfect, the effects were awesome and the whole thing was just a perfect tribute to the<BR>classic comic-book character... I just can't wait for the sequel!!<BR>But before that, I'm hoping to see this movie a few more times at the cinema!...
B00003CXA2|5.0|&quot;FORREST GUMP&quot;(One of my favorite movies) is an uplifting, heartwarming, and heartbreaking, experience, where you see the whole wide world through the eyes of a man who's never seen it before, and hardly understands it.<BR>Through my opinion, &quot;FORREST GUMP&quot; deserved every Oscar it won(Except for one). Tom Hanks(With his back-to-back Oscars) had been amazingly convincing(What, with his accent and all), but I found it nearly absurd that he was chosen over the even more amazingly convincing, Morgan Freeman, in &quot;THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION&quot;(Also one of my favorite movies). While watching this epic for the first time I laughed and cried, nearly at the same time. This movie is awe-inspiring, and though it is PG-13, I wouldn't reccomend this to a kid 10 or under.<BR>The special features on the DVD look interesting and I might buy it someday on DVD, but for now, I'm sticking with what I originally had, the VHS.
B000066NW0|5.0|I heard the single Complicated one time and decided to buy the CD, and for a spur of the moment decision, it was a darn good one.  Avril's Cd is amazing and every song is worth the 15 dollars.  I havn't listened to any other music for the past 2 days with the exception of a Behind the Music episode on Queen.  Her music is real and her voice is strong.  Every song has its own feel and emotion.  I definatly recommend purchasing this album so add it to your cart and click the checkout button, you won't regret it.
014028009X|5.0|I thought this book was great!  It was a quick read and very entertaining.  There were time when I felt sorry for Bridget and other times I wanted to slap some sense into her!! ...
0140177396|5.0|I should have read this book in the 9th grade, but like most of my fellow students, I ended up skimming the book and tossing it in the corner after the final exam. Steinbeck just was not relevant to me at that age. Actually, no literature was relevant. I firmly believe that for some teenagers, a lack of life experience makes the reading of literature an exercise in futility. Of course, this doesn't stop its being assigned, much to the consternation of millions of kids (many of whom are more suited to rap videos and other mind-numbing pap). Literature is a capricious thing; you will either learn to love it, and approach it on your own terms, or hate it and ignore it for life.<br />That being said, this is a book I wished I had read years ago. One of the things I am learning to appreciate about Steinbeck is his ability to convey multi-dimensional messages with prose that is the height of simplicity. There is no fat on his literary bones. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is such a book. Themes of friendship, oppression, and duty jockey for position in this simple tale about two itinerant laborers (one a simpleton; the other his caretaker) drifting through California looking for their slice of the American dream. I don't think it is necessary to go into further detail about the story. Many have read it, and those who have not won't benefit from a detailed description. Heck, the book is short enough that any details thrown out in this review might spoil it for the uninitiated.<br />The introduction to the edition I read made one good point (the rest of the introduction was cutesy-wootsy to the point of nausea) that I had not noticed about the book: \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was an attempt by Steinbeck to see if he could craft a novel that closely resembled a play. When read with this in mind the story does resemble a work made for the stage; there are few set pieces in the story, but an enormous amount of dialogue. It is no wonder there are several stage and film versions of this book floating around.<br />Finally, this book is depressing. There is no happy ending here, as death and danger stalk the pages of the story. I would be lying if I said I was not affected by some of the events in the book. I did not burst out crying, but I did feel gloomy and a little cranky after I finished reading. If you are attempting Steinbeck, you will have to visit this little novella at some point.around.<br />Finally, this book is depressing.

B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is a wonderful movie.  A bit of romance, and rekindling of family ties makes this a fantastic movie to watch to uplift spirits.  The cast is absolutely enchanting and are a joy to watch. Juliette Binoche portrays a free spirited woman who arrives in a rustic French town and touches the lives of the individuals as well as her new village.  Her interactions with the people are amusing and and meaningful as she tends to give them a bit of her free spirit and set the people free of the chains that have kept them from living their lives fully.  Is this a high drama intellectual film, no.  This will entertain you.  The DVD is packed with all sorts of information, interviews, and the making of the film.  This is a what a DVD is meant to be.
B000066F6H|4.0|With all that hype surrounding The Strokes as the next big thing and the comparisons to the Stooges etc. it was inevitable that another band arrive with a realease that was similar or at least in same vain.<br />This..however..IS the next big thing.  There are quite a few bands out now that have a very old school punk edge and I suppose you could classify them as 'emo' (whatever that really means anyway?) but they have it RIGHT.  <br />These Swedes sound like they were weaned on Iggy, Dead Kennedy's and all the godfathers of punk.  <br />If you like punk and you like it raw and as it should be..get this, you won't be sorry.<br />The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it, as alot of  punk does, becomes monotonous after awhile.  <br />Like this CD as I do, it's still not the Stooges, but that's a good thing.
B00003CXI1|4.0|There is no need is describing what a wonderful movie this is.  The DVD quality is excellent, but the interface for the special features is difficult at best.  They advertise never before scenes on TV, but it must take a wave of the Nimbus 2000 to find just those scenes on the DVD.  It took my family 2 nights to try to find these before we gave up.  Very frustrating.  Excellent movie though :)  My feelings are this, this is a children's related movie, but it takes magic to work your way around the DVD.
B00003CXI1|3.0|The movie version of this much loved book series if very pleasing and full of good actors and fun characters.  If you loved reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\", you'll love this movie.  I think Daniel Radcliffe is charming as the loveable Harry and Emma Watson is perfect as Hermione.  That being said, I have to say that the second disc of this 2 dvd set is a nightmare.  Whoever thought that fans would love being tortured with extremely vague directions and almost non existent clues to finding the deleted scenes, etc., should be fired.  I hope Warner Brothers will think over their concept for the dvd for the second movie.  My roommates and I have tried to find all the supposed options and haven't yet been able to decipher any clues.  A friend rented the VHS version and it had two of the deleted scenes.  We were hoping all the deleted scenes would be on the VHS but even it is a disappointment.  One would think that Warner Brothers would have rewarded the fans of this phenomenonally popular series with a dvd that would be fun and easy---especially since kids are gonna be wanting this dvd.  If adults can't figure out the annoyingly hidden clues, I doubt very serious if young Harry Potter fans will be able to either.  Buy the dvd for the movie, which as I have said before, is fun and charming.  But if you are looking for all the extras, be prepared to be extremely frustrated.  I would love to have given the dvd 5 stars---as far as I'm concerned, the movie is 5 stars.  However, given the jumbled mess of the second dvd, I'm only giving it 3 stars.  Note to Warner Bros.---get your act together and give us a better dvd next time!
0679420266|5.0|I have read many of the 284 reviews written before mine, and feel it is important that readers understand what it is that they are reading.<br />First, and foremost, Camus is an existentialist.  As the Encyclopædia Britannica states &quot;...Existentialism does not leave man with nothing to do. Once the nullity of the existential possibilities is recognized, man cannot but resign himself to Being, which, in one of its new manifestations in the world or beyond it, conducts him to a new epoch.&quot;  Thus in its most basic form existentialism is an investigation into Being--how one lives--how one should live.<br />Second, &quot;The Stranger&quot; is not written as Camus sees life, but rather as a critique against his contemporaries, e.g Jean-Paul Sartre, many of whom see life as absurd or pointless.  Do not mistake Meursault's unemotional amoral living as the &quot;Being&quot; of Camus.  Why would Camus argue for such an absurdity when he argues against suicide in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;?  (Sisyphus living perhaps the most absurd of all existences.)<br />Third, and final, Matthew Ward's translation is superb.  Do not be misled by other reviewers that have perhaps not compared translations side by side--Mr. Ward's translation is true to the style of the original--a TRANSLATION rather than a TRANSLITERATION.<br />In conclusion, if one approaches this translation of &quot;The Stranger&quot; with an understanding of existentialism, Camus, and the translation, I believe a full appreciation for this philosophical masterpiece will be gained.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Bland... This album represents everything that is wrong with popular music today. When you're trying to emulate Dave Matthews, you know you're in trouble.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Wonderful DVD, but finding the deleted scenes wasn't fun.  Here's how:<br />1. On the Opening screen on Disc two, select Diagon Alley (Hedwig) <br />2. Put the selector thingy on Gringotts, then press down selecting the key, click to get to the gringotts area then select the Galleon, Sickle, and Knut and click <br />3. Now you should be back at the main page for diagon alley, go to ollivander's and have fun selecting your wand (not sure if its the same for every DVD) <br />4. Go back to the main screen and select the wand and click, getting to the classrooms <br />5. Select Transfiguration (the cat), then hit down to select the owls on the torch, then hit up to select the H on a Shield. Click <br />6. At Fluffy, select the Flute and click <br />7. At the Keys, select the Silver one in the middle with a bent wing (its the only one that is completely over the door in the background) <br />8. At the Bottles (which was not in the Movie) select the round one with the yellow liquid <br />9. Select the Red stone in the mirror to get to the cut scenes(only seven, but i bet theres more)
B00005Y228|5.0|Join the fever! Kylie's newest album FEVER is one of the catchiest albums I've heard in a long while! It's a combination of 80s pop mixed with techno and other genres, which creates and irresistible mix of pop and dance, and will make you want to head out on the dancefloor. FEVER is the album which brought Kylie back to the US, after 14 years, with the worldwide smash Cant Get You Out Of My Head. However, that is just the beginning of the best. More More More, Love At First Sight, Give It To me, Burning Up and Fever are all great songs. Overall its a great fun album to listen to, so go out and get it, and get ready to party!

B00005OWIU|4.0|I thought that this music was very relaxing.  It always puts me to sleep at night.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had no interest in Harry Potter when the books came out.  My sister did, however, and I heard all these strange words: Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Voldemort, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Diagon Alley, Nimbus 2000, Qudditch???  Umm... yeah... sounds... interesting.  So, I avoided the books.  Yet, for some unkown reason, I went along with my family to see the theatrical release.  In a single word, it was excellant.  Great acting.  Interesting storyline.  Excellant movie. I watched it 5 times.  After my first viewing, I had already started reading the books.  And of course, I had a copy of the DVD pre-ordered.<br />Now, for some thoughts on the DVD.  I am not going to get into the differences between the book and the movie.  Many forget that the movie is based on the book.  As such, I regard the two as seperate entities.  The movie covered much of the important parts in the book.  All of the cast was great.  I am glad that Chris Columbus got the directing part over Speilburg.  Columbus picked some very talented, British actors and actresses to fill the roles.  My favorite actress in the movie was Maggie Smith.  The storyline was very interesting and the sights were simply amazing.  Columbus did a great job in bringing the world of Harry Potter to life.  <br />My only dislike about the DVD is the poor accompaniment of additional features.  There was little commetary and the deleted scenes were very difficult to find.  I had to go to the message board ...to find that out (It was also disapointing to find 7 relatively short deleted scenes after all that work too).  And finally, I wanted more information about the making of the movie, interviews with the cast, and sneak previews of Chamber of Secrets.  Despite these dislikes, I still give five stars to the DVD for containing one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
B000002VCQ|3.0|Well. This was Whitneys debut album. Yes its her most sucesful LP. (if you dont count the Bodyguar soundtrack). To me this is just an average album because I am no Whitney fans it lacks originality it seems to be missing very much lyrically and the only thing which helps the LP is whitneys voice which is probably the only talent this Whitney Houston has (she doesnt write,compose,produced and is a terrible actress and a spokeswoman and not really a great peformer). But if you are a Whitney fan and fan of 80s R&amp;B buy it.
0380817683|5.0|I ususally can only be found reading my textbooks for school (I am a painting major at UCF), but when I started this book on a vacation I spent every free moment reading it!  It was just catchy and humorous.  Not exactly a deep novel, but was a light-hearted approch to a serious subject, addiction.  I read the entire book almost without stopping.  I found it easy to relate to the characters and there seemed to be someone from my life that was similar to the characters in the book.  A great read for a beach day or plane ride.  Last Chance Saloon by Keyes is delightful as well.
B000006U44|5.0|This album is so good. It includes one of the best compositions ever and the lyrics are excellent and Kates Bush voice is beautiful. Do I need to say more. Buy it.
B00000JCOV|5.0|On their debue album, Slipknot violently rip through 14 tracks with sheer aggression. This , their debue is a sonic pipe bomb:<BR>a ballistic hybrid of Techno ,Hip - Hop ,  Industrial and Metal. The album is driven by furious tribal percussion , topped off with blistering double bass drumming. Colliding head on with the furious percussive onslaught are piledriving speed - metal guitars and wicked sound manipulation. Also vocalist Corey Taylor has some of the most unique pipes in metal , spewing forth lyrics of revenge and anti-establishment rhetoric through a throaty roar all his own(and at times powerful melodic singing).Slipknots debue album is a landmark for originality ,intensity and sheer unhinged emotion.A violent endorphin rush that will flawlessly knock you to the floor! Slipknot are 9 men poised for world domination!!!!<br />Dig this?<BR>then check out: <BR>CHIMAIRA - PASS OUT OF EXSISTANCE.<BR>SLAYER - REIGN IN BLOOD.<BR>SOULFLY - SOULFLY.
B0000683DH|1.0|The so-called \\"directors cut\\" of Star Trek:The Wrath Of Khan is just the same film with an extra 3 minutes added on.And worse still,they didn't fix up the sub-standard Eden Cave waterfall effect which is badly over-exposed.At the time,an ILM effects man stated that they simply \\"didn't have the time to get it right\\".Well,now they had the time,but nothing was done.I still remember my Daily News review in 1982 stating \\"but with the Eden Cave effect,they(ILM)fail dismally\\"....right now it's basically the same as the previous DVD with an extra disc with interviews.Save your money if you have the first one.<br />This film could be so much better if Paramount did what they did with the first film and release it with better special effects,or at the very least correct the bad ones.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|When I saw this on TV when it first came out, I was completely blown away. Every element in the classic Western was there-the cattle drive, the renegade Indian, the corrupted cowboy, the [prostitute] with the heart of gold. . . And most of all, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert  Duvall in the roles of theit lives! It sounds like a collection of bad cliches, but it's not. If you like Westerns, forget modern slop like \\"Tombstone\\" and the Clint Eastwood films. This made-for-TV film tells the story of the American West and the tragic story of the death of the Frontier. Listen carefully to what Colonel Call is told when he comes back to Lonesome Dove at the end.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|About a year ago I stumbled on the trailer for this movie .... Up to that time I had heard the name Angelina Jolie, but I had never seen her, and I didn't have a clue as to who Lara Croft was. As soon as it was released, I went to see it and, in spite of some of the negative reviews shown here, I really liked it. It is an \\"Indiana Jones\\" with a female lead. That's bad? Boys and girls this is a fantasy adventure. Don't over-analyze it. The acting is good, the effects are good and, overall, it is very entertaining. Leave it at that, buy the movie and enjoy! I introduced Lara Croft to my six and three year old grandsons and they enjoyed \\"Tomb Raider\\". So now there are three fans in my family. I see that there are several very negative reviews that have been posted subsequent to mine and I am not sure why. I still (as of September 25, 2002) think this is a fun movie and, every so often, I watch it again. My grandsons and I are looking forward to TOMB RAIDER 2 in 2003.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I have seen the movie at movie theater. I like it very much, wish there are more like the book I read.    However, true that 2nd disk does giving trouble for people who do not know what to look for. Most people around me did not read the book or know how to solve/play the game. The company should have leave all 7 never before-seen-before scenes in the movie than on 2nd disk. OR They can make dvd with no game and dvd with game so that we can pick what we want.    Last of all, I am very disappointed that all 7 scenes do not have English subtitle! No closed caption/English subtitle for me to know what they were saying. I am deaf. I have found almost all of my dvd movies does not put closed caption/English subtitle for special features. They should. Any movie maker company should do that. It is not fair for me to \\"suffer\\" with lot of guesswork for 7 sceness- trying to imagine what they were saying.    All DVD movies I have said \\"closed caption\\" They did not appear on my tv or anyone's tv! I tried with different system and different tv. No such luck. I wish they should be clear if closed caption is English subtitle then PLEASE mark it clear! I personally doubt regular closed caption works at all. Three of movies I have with no English subtitle- they were labeled with closed caption- NONE! Totally waste my time with any movie's special features-\\"blind sound(voices, etc)\\"(don't know what to call it) for me.      UPDATE: And finally, 2011, I recently found out HP4 movie for PSP... I am so shock that it has NO CLOSED CAPTION NOR ENGLISH SUBTITLE!!! Seriously?!?!? I am deaf and I do really want to be able to enjoy the movie on my PSP (region 1) It is not fair for deaf people. I wish they would made all HP movie 1-7 with english subtitle for deaf (SHD) it is important for us to be able to watch/enjoy and understand the story. Please somebody do it for us. Thanks.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I feel after many months of waiting for a Resident Evil movie and firing Romero from the project (would have been better) they came out with a decent and watchable movie. The movie follows the early beginnings of the games goes mostly to the prequel game though called Resident Evil zero (gamecube). The costumes and effects were done well and kept to the dark nature of the game. It comes down to being one of the best video game movies released yet. I mean what did it have a fight against Tombraider? but thats another story. The movie is well acted but they lose too much of the search party too early in. I mean 4 members 30 minutes into the movie that was overkill. All in all the movie was well worth the wait of almost 2 years of hype.
B000063USY|1.0|Ohhh yes.  I knew I had seen this movie before.  But the first time it was surfing.  The main actor's voice even sounded like Keano Reeves.
6305252521|5.0|This is Jim Carrey's best movie in my opinion. In this movie Carrey isnt character acting and making a goof of himself. I mean I love Jim Carrey movies but it was a nice change to see him play this part. Jim Carrey stars as Truman Burbank, a man whose entire life has been a tv show and he doesnt know it. Only when he falls in love with a castmate who mysteriously gets sent to Fiji just before she can tell him the truth, does he realize that he is trapped in a community of actors. I loved this movie. Its a must have for those who really love Jim Carrey's work and would love to see him in a wonderful role.
B000002H33|5.0|If you are looking for the best heavy metal album of all time, then look no further, man.  Brilliant lyrics, and lightning quick, out-of-this-world musicianship make this album stand tall above the rest of this musical genre, even just ever so slightly over \\"Justice\\" and \\"Ride The Lightning\\".  When you hear Lars Ulrich's insanely fast drumming, James Hetfield's mind-bending rhythm guitar, Kirk Hammett's super-sonic guitar solo's, and Cliff Burton's magical bass, you begin to ask yourself, \\"How in the heck do they play that fast?\\"  All 8 songs are primo, but my fav is 'Damage Inc.'  Kirk Hammett pulls off possibly the fastest guitar solo of all time on that song.  I'm a guitar player, so I can appreciate how great and fast these guys play.  If you want to hear 'REAL' heavy metal, then you need to do yourself a favor and get this one.  No offense to people who likes  Kid Rock, Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit, but these 'newer' bands can't hold a candle to Metallica, especially Metallica's older stuff like this.  Simply put, \\"Master Of Puppets\\" is the best of the best. If you don't have it, you know the drill.  ROCK ON!!!
B00004STUL|5.0|This movie is amazing. The explosion scenes are amazing. But you know Michael Bay always had to go out with a bang. The plot isnt that good, but Lawrence and Smith make you forget all about it. They are so hilarious. These two are incredible on the screen together. I recommend this movie to people who just want a thrill ride full of laughter and not much of a plot.
0804102988|5.0|I have been fortunate enough to have visited the Salisbury Plain area, including Salisbury Cathedral, and Stonehenge.  Actually, I bought my copy at the Stonehenge site, but was not able to read it until my return home.  The cathedral is as awesome in reality as Mr. Rutherfurd describes in his book.  The stone walls, St. Ann's Gate, Old Sarum, Stonehenge, and even the unique sundial on the side of the house he mentions are actually to be seen today.  The book brings the area to life in a way, I never imagined it could.  I am ready to return to the area with a renewed interest and appreciation for its rich history.  I again want to gaze on the Cathedral with a clearer understanding of the sacrifice, energy, and passion involved to create such a beautiful edifice in the first place.  I took a particularly nice photo of the Cathedral, and when I look at the gorgeously graceful spire,  I can better appreciate the amazing engineering feat it is, thanks to the care Mr. Rutherfurd has taken to describe the stones and its masons in living color.  I thank him, and look forward to letting his novel London give me a similar experience of historical London.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This movie is a classic in the world of indie films. Actually the best of the best. Kevin Smith is a film making wonderboy. This movie is extremely funny. It follows the day of Dante Hicks, a guy who gets called into work at the Quick Stop Groceries in Jersey and complains all day to his friend Randall about how he wasnt suppose to be there today. But I think the best part of this movie is the fact that Walt Flannigan and Scott Mosier play about five different people in the movie. Its entertaining to try and see who they will be next. And of course this movie is the beginning to the Jersey Trilogy and the beginning of the best duo to come along since the Odd Couple, Jay and Silent Bob. You cant call yourself a Kevin Smith fan if you do not own this dvd, so go now...hurry press add to cart and own this movie! Plus the alternate ending, music video and commentary are good extras.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I don't know. Maybe I'm getting old, but I like an album with textures, thought, and musical integrity. I gave up on waiting for Bon Jovi to become the Beatles years ago...oh, the horror! Not long after that era, I began to listen to bands like Pavement, Guided by Voices, and Uncle Tupelo. I found the independent bands really focused on the music and lyrics, and they meant something. They meant something to me as well, whether or not it was what the bands intended. It didn't matter anyway. The music of Uncle Tupelo (later to become Wilco and Son Volt) was like nothing I've ever listened to before, except maybe Robert Johnson recordings. The lyrics were about life, the music was rooted in America, like the smell of fresh clothes hanging outside all day in the sun. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot breaths life into contemporary America. Like a couch cover gives new meaning to that old comfortable sofa, Wilco gives the music we grew up hating, learned to endure, and slowly started to love a coat of new paint. I can't help but feel these songs mean something deeper, but I think it is more about emotion and feeling, and less about intellectual stimulation. YHF is a beautiful homage to TV dinners, mangey dogs, and out-of-date prescriptions in the back of the medicine cabinet (whatever that means). I'm rambling. Buy the album. Listen to it for awhile. I think you'll hear what I'm talking about. Maybe. It's an album that will last.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is just what its suppose to be. Its filled with fast cars, hot guys and tough chicks. The story line reminds me Point Break. Ya know the whole cop going undercover to find the crooks and getting in tangled in their lives so much he doesnt want to let it go. But I loved Point Break and I loved The Fast and the Furious. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are exceptionally hot and and Michelle Rodriguez does what she does best...acts like a tough chica who can hang just as well as the guys. I recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for an adrenalin ride of fun.
0553573403|5.0|This is quality, stop searching through the thousands of books which look and sound the same, this series is what you need.  I am incredibly picky because most fantasy books are basically the same, thank goodness I read this one.  You will NOT regret it.
B000002L68|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks ever made. No wonder it won an Oscar. This is Prince's greatest creation. After this cd he has never quite been the same. Songs like When Doves Cry and the beautiful Purple Rain are etched in the minds of everyone. If you dont own this cd think about it, arent those songs still dancing in your head? Then go for it! You have nothing to lose and so much to gain by owning this musical masterpiece. I enjoy listening to this cd even now. So let his purple majesty take you on a trip through the Purple Rain.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Normally I shy away from Sci Fi due to the usual goop and robot insect creatures, so I waited forever to see this movie. Keanu Reeves really got me hooked on the story. He is perfect as the software techie/hacker who moves from virtual reality to reality (they say).<br /><br />The fear of machines taking over the world is exploited to the max. Humans are not only used as a power source, they are bred for the job. Each living in their own virtual reality, while being hooked up to serve the planet. Anyway, that is a small part of the movie, although disturbing.<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) is drawn into his own destiny through a phone call and phones become an intrical part of the story as the way the characters move back into a state of reality, where their bodies are hooked up ready for their minds to be programmed with the newest information at a minutes notice.<br /><br />Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is trying to save the planet from the machine takeover and is convinced Neo is the \\"one.\\" Near the end of the movie, Keanu gets into some real power positions that are highly attractive.<br /><br />He knows how the world should be, how it deserves to be, and everywhere he turns, he is faced with the fact that there is something wrong with his world. In fact, he is not in the real world, but in a virtual type reality that controls his life.<br /><br />In order to conquer this world, he has to start to believe he can. During this fight for what he believes is right, the special effects really capture your attention.<br /><br />I was pretty fascinated with all the concepts involved. It was not only intellectually fulfilling, but there is a ton of suspense.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B00003CXI1|5.0|J.K. Rowling's mega-bestseller receives an excellent film treatment from director Chris Columbus, although the film falls just shy of true masterpiece status.<br />You'd have to have lived in a cave in Afghnistan not to know the plot: Harry Potter lives a miserable existence in the cupboard under the staircase at the home of his Aunt and Uncle Dursley, and their spoiled rotten son Dudley.  But just as Harry turns 11, he is accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his hidden heritage as a wizard is revealed, a heritage of fame throughout the world witches and wizards, a heritage with powerful enemies and unexpected dangers.<br />Columbus does an outstanding job of re-creating Rowling's world onto the screen.  Daniel Radcliffe is excellent as Harry, and the supporting cast is stellar, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Richard Harris as Hogwarts' Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick, Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, and Alan Rickman as the sinister Professor Snape.<br />However, the movie's greatest flaw comes from its overly faithful adherence to the book.  Out of sheer necessity, some scenes have been cut, but the movie sticks to the book like glue.  This provides a limiting factor, as books and films are different media, following different rules.  For instance, Peter Jackson made sensible changes on &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, by not being as slavish to that book, resulting in an improved film.<br />Ironically, one of biggest bones to pick with this film is the elimination of a scene near the end of the film, where Hermione is denied a scene of physical courage that was in the book.<br />Still, the widescreen version is a classic, with a wonderful score by John Williams.  The DVD features are interesting, although a bit lacking, and are nothing special.  It's also a pain to have to unlock the deleted scenes which are contained on the second disc.<br />But, to paraphrase The Bard, &quot;The film's the thing.&quot;  And this is a film no family should be without.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is an intimate, sweet collection of tracks. The production is superb and the performances have character. My two favorite tracks are Come With Me and Nightingale (which Norah wrote herself). Nice work Norah. Can't wait for the next album.
B000008GEF|4.0|this is a great album. one more great song on it and i could hail it as another superior masterpiece to any other albums of the time, but there are some slow songs on it that just aren't MY style, not saying they aren't easy to enjoy for the ballad fan. the songs on here i DO like a whole lot are: living in the material world, sue me sue you blues, give me love (give me peace on earth), don't let me wait too long, the lord loves the one that loves the lord, and try some buy some (i'm not sure why i love this one), and be here now is actually good although slow. I like the acoustic guitar on that one. it's good though, and george proves his greatness yet again on this one.... BUY IT!
0441003257|5.0|This is one of the better books I have had the pleasure to read.  The characters bring the philosophical concepts of religious and historical beliefs into a different light.<br />The only part of the book that slows the reader down is &quot;young Adam.&quot;  I wish these two great writers would have done something different with that.<br />Other than that, I will and have most certainly recommended this book.  Not only is it hilarious, but it does offer, and even forces,the reader to think about established teachings and ideas.
B00005JKMQ|1.0|I feel sorry for Muhammed Ali.  It must be tough being a charismatic, interesting person, and having your life displayed in such a terrible fashion as this movie presents.  I get the feeling most critics really wanted to like this movie going in, and were afraid to talk about how bad it really was.  It opens with an incredibly boring ten minute musical, and progresses to get even worse.  If you can stomach more than 30 minutes of this travesty, you're more of a masochist than I.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yes, the playing around in the studio with different sounds to fill the holes and gaps reeks of artsy pretenciousness, but it works! Why? Great story writing and musical mastery. 'Iam trying to break your heart' works well with its enriched sounds that are very 'Enoish', 'Kamera' is more upbeat Wilco, 'War on War' continues with the poppiness,'Heavy metal drummer' is really a dancy beat/rootsy song, etc... Yankee Hotel Foxtrot continues the enrichment of american music in the same vein that a.m.,and being there did (with the exception of the misstep of summer teeth). This is good stuff.  Can't wait for the reissues of early uncle tupelo!
B000002J1B|4.0|Sound Chaser is the true Gate to Delirium. Once your perception of this song changes from \\"What is this noise?!\\" to \\"Ohmygod, this is brilliant!!\\", you can never come back.<br />This is Yes' best album.  It could have earned 5/5 if it weren't for the relatively boring \\"To Be Over.\\"
B00004Z3AV|5.0|I have owned this triple 'Platinum' Album for some months now, already being a big fan of Queen, I couldn't believe my luck when I found this album. Disc one most obviously contains all of queens most popular hits, from the marvelous Bohemian Rhapsody to the Banging We will Rock You.<br />Disc Two contains yet more hits, including 'Its a kinda magic' and Under Pressure.<br />Disc Three contains tracks that are queen, but either covered, or sung with other artists, such as Show Must go on, Somebody to love and Another one bites the dust. There are also a couple of the bands solo outings, such as: Living on my own and driven by you.<br />I recommend you to add this sraight to your basket immedietly, whether you are a long standing fan or a new comer to the unique sound that is Queen !!
B00005JKCF|4.0|Some of my friends which are comic book artists say this is the best comic-book adaptation ever, or even a masterpiece. I wouldn't go that far. Although it's better than all Superman movies and recent Batman disasters, it still is what it is: CGI mayhem with some character development (wow!) and few nice scenes for kids. It's too lightweight even for X-men (which I liked very much), not to compare it to darkness of Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns. <br />The script is solid, and waiting for the sequel will be like waiting for the next NBA basketball season - you know it's coming, but it all depends if you like the basketball.<br />For me, CGI Spidey flying without control was a plus, CGI spidey fighting was a minus. If it was a bit more character driven (like X-Men) and a little darker, it would be fantastic. This is compromise for the kids (an understandable one) so it is pretty darn good.<br />So, Green Goblin is dead. Bring the Son of Green Goblin plus antoher great villain and you'll be on our way for Spidey No.3!<br />Go, web, go!
0345413377|4.0|Avid readers have been waiting year after year for the third and final book in Philip Pullman's trilogy \\"His Dark Materials.\\"    It's finally out in bookstores - and it's no disappointment.  Lyra Silvertounge and Will Parry, two young children whose remarkable adventures began in The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, meet again in The Amber Spyglass.  Will carries the Subtle Knife, a mysterious object which can cut into different worlds, while Lyra possesses the Golden Compass, or alethiometer, which can tell the future, past, and present.  With the help of the armored bear Iorek Byrnison, two tiny Gallevespian spies and many others, Lyra and Will venture into a world that no living people have been in before and come out alive - the world of the dead.  Meanwhile, Dr. Mary Malone is building an Amber Spyglass in the land of mulefa, which allows her to see Dust, a substance that gives the world it's life.  For some unexplained reason, Dust is draining from the world, and plants and trees are dying.  And while all this is happening, assassins are hunting Mary and the children down.<br /> The Amber Spyglass is a book that many will find hard to put down.  Philip Pullman takes the reader on a journey through the universe, introducing many strange and unusual characters: witches, mulefa, armored bears, tiny people, dæmons, and angels.  Although these are characters that no human being would expect to see here on earth, Philip Pullman made them entirely believable.  Even so, I thought The Amber Spyglass was a bit hard to \\"get into,\\" or become interested in.  However, around chapter four, I became addicted to this book.  Overall, I would give this book 4.5 stars out of 5.  For anyone who needs a good book, The Amber Spyglass is the one to get!
B00004STPT|5.0|This CD is amazingly beautiful. I love the theme song and that was the main reason I bought the CD, but the whole disc is wonderful! Hans Zimmer has donw an excellent job,as always. Don't waste any time, if you love movie soundtracks, go buy this now. You will not regret it at all!
B000003S2M|1.0|i want to be able to hear the music before i buy it!
B000066NW0|4.0|This CD... hmmm... well, the music is great pop, and the lyrics are simple and catchy, but there are some idiosyncrasies.  It kind of bothers me that Avril, even though she sort of rubs your face in the whole &quot;I don't believe in labels&quot; thing, is always emphasizing the differences between &quot;skaters&quot; and &quot;preps&quot;... it's just sort of hypocritical, I think.  Oh, and on TV and stuff... why is it necessary for her to proclaim that she is a &quot;skater punk&quot; every other sentence?  I think she has some identity issues.<br />But, oh, well, it's all in good fun, right?<BR>Buy this CD, it's awesome and fun.
0440219078|5.0|This is a superb book. I have read and re-read it many times, and loved it every time.<br />The book also forces you to think about things that most people don't think about that much, and to re-analzye certain common philosophical assumptions.<br />I think that everyone should read this book at least once in their life.<br />The biggest problem that I had with this book is the rather unsatisfactory ending; the story's resolution is suggested, but nothing is stated. Personally, I would have liked the story to have continued a little longer so as to find out what had happened later.
6305508550|5.0|This is one of the most comforting movies I know. When you get home from Dilbertland, and the world seems insane, pop this movie in and laugh at someone having it truly rough. It's cheaper than hypnotherapy.<br />I feel so strongly about the healing nature of this film, I will often purchase a copy and send it to a friend when they describe a particularly brain fryingly stupid day in corporate America.<br />And it's also a great quote movie. Watch it and the next day you'll be walking around saying, \\"Why should I? He's the one that sucks.\\"<br />The DVD itself is light on features, but regardless, you'll want this movie on hand for emergencies. Let someone else fill out the TPS reports, and enjoy.
0312243022|1.0|Words cannot describe how much this book annoyed me. I cannot fathom how it possibly won two major awards ... I guess that just goes to show that the award committees are only human, and are capable of error as much as anyone.<br />To begin, I still have a headache from having the theme dropped onto my head like so many anvils, all throughout the book. This book is about Hours! The hours! The passing of time! The fading of beauty! The transcience of beauty! The passing THROUGH time from virility to death! About this painful passage through time and how do we survive all these hours?! Do you get it? Can you understand? Do I need to mention hours again? If Mr. Cunningham thinks his readers are so dumb as to need to have this pounded into our heads again and again and again, then perhaps he needs to write for children.<br />Furthermore, I do not agree with those who say the characters are all so well developed. There was no differentiation between the three main characters; they all spoke with the same morbid, self-absorbed voice. And, I suspect if we were to meet Mr. Cunningham, we'd find that to be his own morbid, self-absorbed voice.<br />Maybe this is a book only a pessimist can love. Some reviewers have said that anyone who has been through a depression will feel the ring of truth to this book - that's malarky. This book isn't about depression. It feels like a book written by a pessimist who is trying to write about optimism. It comes across as completely [misleading]. This book comes across as the literary equivalent of someone who wears nothing but gothic black, trying to convince us that everyone in the world dresses the same way.<br />I could go on but mostly, I'm just glad it's such a quick read, and didn't take up more of my time. If you have a morbid, pessimisitic personality, give it a try. You might love it. But if you are a person who is capable of TRULY seeing beauty in the world - even, gasp!, in aging, in the passing of time - then run, don't walk, away from this book!!
B00004STPT|4.0|It's good, even though I only mainly listen to the tracks number 3 and 13, truly energetic and military-like.
630264366X|4.0|What Would Jesus Do (WWJD) in Nazi occupied Rome? Gregory Peck as Fr. O'Flaherty answers this question the best he can, despite tacit opposition from the Pope himself, by helping to spirit escaped allied POWs and Jews out from under the noses of the Gestapo. Christopher Plummer plays the SS colonel who \\"owns\\" Rome (an interesting contrast with his role as Baron von Trapp in The Sound of Music). Peck stays on his toes, continuously exploring ways of outwitting the growing Nazi oppression. <br />Although not overtly religious--well, it's hard to set a story in the Vatican without being religious! While the movie doesn't explore spirituality in depth (nor does it seek to proselytize), it does paint several ethical dilemmas. <br />A powerful story, one I'd like to see on DVD, with background material. Worthy of a documentary as well. Almost hard to believe that a movie about a Jesuit member of the Holy Order (ie the Inquisition) could be this riveting. It is. <br />(If you'd like to discuss this movie or review in greater detail, please click on the \\"about me\\" link above and drop me an email. Thanks!)
0780619609|5.0|I watched Ninja Turtles while I was growing up so it didn't matter how bad the movie might have been, I would still enjoy it. I thought this one was pretty funny, especially with Vanilla Ice in it. It may not have been a great movie with oscar winning performances, but for any turtles fan, it was definitely worth watching.
B000002U9L|5.0|It doesn't get any cuter than a 2-year-old who does the &quot;you remind me of the babe&quot; dialog with you! She watched the DVD and she was hooked.  We know have labyrinth wallpaper and sounds on the computer.  And more recently this wonderful soundtrack!  My personal favorite is Underground, that is an AWESOME song.  My daughter, of course, likes Dance Magic.  The whole soundtrack is great, buy it!  What are you waiting for?
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay manages this and more in their debut album, Parachutes. Lightly strummed acoustic guitars and lightly pinged symbols accompany the soft beautifully sung vocals turns Parachutes into an almost orchestral album, with all instruments working together to support the cause. As so many young, talented artists such as John Mayer have sold out their music to MTV on their debuts , Coldplay remains true to form. Highlights of this album include Everything's Not Lost, and Trouble. This music is perhaps universal as I listened to primarily jazz before buying this album. Buy Parachutes, you won't be dissapointed.
0679777547|4.0|People who call this book anti-climatic aren't over-exaggerating in the slightest. \\"The Club Dumas\\" -- while it can be appreciated for it's nuances and fine imagery (not to mention the meticulous detail the author *painstakingly* researched to have such a complete history and knowledge of bookmaking and binding) makes it a bit of a treasure. True, it has a lot of \\"common\\" crime-novel cliches, and even goes so far as to illuminate someone who may or may not be the devil (it's a tricky thing to decide) as a main character.<br />Despite it being rather musty to the eye of some readers, this book hold in it's pages something remarkable; true writer's talent. Arturo Perez-Reverte is a fantastically wonderful writer, who's wit manages to more than survive the English translation (by Sonia Soto). I have more than once put down this book and blinked a few times, trying to digest an odd bit of dialog here, or some vague but fascinating imagery there.<br />The manuscript reflects how much of a book enthusiast Perez-Reverte really must be. His attention to detail (I can't stress this enough, how amazing it is and how subtly it can slip by you, unless you pay attention) and his careful construction of the nearly-hidden plot is brilliantly done. <br />Would I recommend this book? Of course, but only to people who truly like to *read*.
B000002G8H|5.0|I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Clapton in concert shortly after this album came out. It was sensational to say the least, and I felt that I was actually \\"in the same room\\" with Slowhand himself. There is not a song on the album that is bad, in fact, I believe he was at the peak of his career, not to say he has ever come down just yet, but this surely is his best work so far. No collection of guitar greats should be without this masterpiece, and it truly is \\"Wonderful Tonight\\"
B000066JES|5.0|I was really skeptical with this album before I heard it due to the knowledge that it would feature patriotic material which I was really sick of. I thought it would be sappy and fake like all the  9/11 tribute-like crap, which I couldn't see Manowar doing from the start. But no. The patriotic  songs on this album are straight from the heart and is beaming with honor and pride. The rest of the album is full with fighting and Viking lore, which is a big plus in my book. I also thought that Eric Adams' voice was starting to break up on Louder than Hell, but his vocals are as great and powerful as ever. This album stole the podium from Triumph of Steel as not only my favorite Manowar album, but the greatest album ever!
B000063JDE|5.0|One of the first things I looked for in this dvd was the infamous deleted scene in the bar where a topless woman strikes a match and lights her, um, sensitive areas on fire.  The deleted scenes couldn't be found so stills are put to music.  That is the only complaint about the entire package.  There is a very entertaining review by Siskel and Ebert included, a great documentary about the film, and hidden extras.  As for the film itself, it definately isn't for everyone.  For those who enjoy Lynch, this is one of his better films if not his best.  The plot is more linear than Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, though that's not necessarily a good thing to fans of Lynch's more recent work.  Basically, this is the film where Lynch's obsession with darkness lying under the surface of innocence manifested itself.  Everything, from the super saturated colors to the deliberately fake looking robin signifying hope, contributes to this beautifully horrifying comedy about growing into manhood and discovering the world for what it really is.  I can't recommend this film strongly enough, though I must say if you haven't seen it yet you should rent it before buying it.
0395510600|5.0|I got to read the book by my cousin because she introduced the book to me and after I read the book, I thought that it was the most greatest and interesting book I have ever read. <BR>     The book was about two girls named AnneMarie and Ellen Rosen. Ellen and her family were Jewish and this was during the Holocaust, which was when the Nazis were invading the Jewish people, so when Ellen's parents went to hide in a safer country, Ellen went to go live with AnneMarie and her family and disguised herself as AnneMarie's other sister, who died long ago. It took place in Denmark during the 1940s. <BR>     I liked the book because it had alot of meaning to me. I read the book over and over because I thought that it was a marvelous and fabulous book. I recommend this book to everyone because it teaches you what life was back then and what two friends meant to each other. The friendship between Ellen and AnneMarie was strong and was close enough to hold them together through the Holocaust.
0385334176|2.0|This is not among Vonnegut's best.  The plot rambles, the jokes aren't very funny, and above all it's pretty depressing, and lacks meaning.  I would recommend Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, but this one is best left unread.
B000007RV5|5.0|When Limp Bizkit first debuted this cd, I bought it and loved it,because my 2 favorite types of music were and still are rap and metal, this cd is hardcore, its loud in your face,and catchy, the riffs are amazing, and only on this cd does Fred Durst sound like a lead singer of a metal band with rap influences, instead of trying to actually be a rapper, because he is definetly not. This is the only LB cd I have, I bought Signifigant Other, but I sold it, because it wasnt a rock cd, it was Fred Durst trying to rap. This is Limp Bizkits best cd.

He unwittingly uncovers and becomes a part of a conspiracy that he has to try to decipher while trying to stay alive. GREAT FLICK! Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, and Max von Sydow are great!

6301963717|5.0|Simpley fantastic. This movie is a masterpiece for the Coen brothers. The picture is visually stunning. The costumes and the atmosphere are wonderful. This movie is a throw back to old gangster movies and a different time. Albert Finney, John Turturro and Gabriel Bryne fill out this cast of quirky characters. The dialouge is well written and fun. Turturro gives an amazing performance as the sleazy Bernie Bernbaum. Gabriel Bryne is perfect as the cynical man behind the man. And Albert Finney is my personal favorite as Leo, an old time Boss of the cities political machine. Don't forget Steve Buschemi as Mink and The Dane. One of my personal favorites.
B000050XEI|3.0|Regretably, it's beginning to look like it.  This album is far too short (34 minutes) and all the tracks remind me of her earlier works.  Which is a shame, because each of her earlier albums were distinctive and unique.What puzzles me is why the new tracks &quot;Only If&quot; and &quot;Paint The Sky With Stars&quot; were not included.  These two tracks (found on Best of Enya) are brilliant enough to have made this CD worth buying. I reccommend you buy Best of Enya and leave this one be.
B0000640SA|5.0|After watching Memento after it became available to domestic theaters, I became an instant fan.  Its witty cinematography combined with the philosophical perception of reality made this movie a masterpiece &quot;in my mind&quot;.  I found myself among the few lucky fans having procrastinated the original dvd, and I can saftely say my patience greatly rewarded.  This DVD immediatly had an appeal to me with its Psychiatric Report design, and the mental evaluation menu system.  For the easily destracted, you should fell comfort in knowing the first cd is incredibly easy to function, and is not at all time consuming.  However, Disc 2 does involve deductive logic; some questions relating directly to the movie, others are more subjective.  Its not the content of the questions which can cause a hasel, but more the amount you have to answer in order to unlock the goodies.  However, I love this DVD and feel extremely comfortable with its design and creativity.  I strongly suggest this DVD to anyone who prefers originality over practicality.
