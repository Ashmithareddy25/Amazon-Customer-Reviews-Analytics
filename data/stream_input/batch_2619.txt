B008220D7S|1.0|Despite containing 2 discs and a &#34;digital copy&#34; the &#34;Unrated&#34; version of the film is not to be found on this set. I don't even own a Blu-Ray player but I bought this one believeing the cover that there was an unrated version of the film contained here. The BluRay apparently contains a link to the unrated verison for download or something like that.... completely useless to me. Deceptive packaging, over-packaging, waste plastic, useless discs... this kind of crap is destroying our planet for no reason. I love the movie, but this set gets an &#34;F&#34; from me.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|Great graphics --- but doesn't do any good if it cannot be played off-line.  Kids cannot play the game in the car or \\"anywhere.\\"  Need a version that can be played off-line.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book is simply nowhere near Gaiman's usual standard. I could barely make it through the first half of the book. It picks up toward the middle but the damage is done and overall it's not a satisfying read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I don't mind waiting for timers and still find plenty to do in the downtime! Not having to spend real money on things just to progress is really nice!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was a very gripping examination of a parent's mind in the crisis that precipitated the plot.  I was quite surprised by the conclusion; the clues were there, but I didn't see them coming
0321701763|5.0|Nice quality with glossy pages and plenty of pictures. Used it in class and at the end of semester sold it for almost what I paid.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|This isn't the first time Disney has had its fingers in the amazing books of Baum. Back in 1985 it released Return to Oz, based on two of the author's books. That movie was too dark (ahead of its time) for common audience sensibilities, but I thought it was pretty well crafted.<br />Now Disney takes a fresh approach to the origins of the wizard, carefully avoiding any legal issues while blending this with the original MGM Wizard of Oz very neatly.<br />The carefully crafted &#34;Aha!&#34; moments work well. The movie's 3D effects seem to me to be well done, if just a little intrusive.<br />Its success will surely lead to more exploits of this newly-discovered wizard and the magical world he inhabits.<br />This will be a permanent part of my personal library.
B0000DJYOX|5.0|This is truly one of the best albums ever made by the stones.<br />If your looking to buy a stones album, start off with this one, let it bleed, sticky fingers, exile on main street, or some girls.<br />I call them the fabulous five cause they are the best.<br />I would reccomend this to anyone who likes good music.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a very fun, clever puzzle game. The levels were not too hard, and I found myself smiling at some of the solutions. The one downside is that there are only 10 levels and none of them take very long. I finished the entire game very quickly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game it makes you think, I even had to pull in help on one level because I was stuck for so long. Totally a fun game.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Finished it. I really liked it. I wish he would have wrote more in certain areas, but I enjoyed the different point of views from so many characters.
B008JFUPFI|1.0|Superman is considered the first and the greatest Super hero ever created. The Man of Steel is a horrible movie and is nothing like the comic character we all know and love. At the begging when Russell Crowe was flying around on a dragon it was so stupid. Come on this is a superman movie, not some stupid harry potter avatar fantasy crap. The planet krypton in this movie was awful and looked like red planet from a star wars movie. What happened to the beautiful place with crystals? The Kryptonian council looked incredibly stupid wearing gold and looking like Egyptian pharaohs instead of the traditional white robes with their family crest on them. If there were spaceships and dragons only in this new version on Krypton, why didn't the kryptonians just fly away on there ships when the planet started to rumble and explode? They should have also never had zod stab and kill jor-el at the beginning, it changed the greatness of seeing Jorel and Lara together as the only survivor of krypton took off in the sky in his rocket. In the movie they then skipped the whole story of Kal-el landing on earth and the Kent's finding him in a field. This film has tons of flash backs when he was a kid that are really short and you don't get that much information, they were ok, but since there were so much of them it drives you a little crazy. They should have done some sequences in order. The Kent parents did not really show at all any love an compassion like they were meant to do. I hated how instead of having the dramatic sad event when Johnathan has a heart attack, they had him disappear in the twister because he didn't want Clark to save him and expose himself in front of the other people. Come on Clark exposed his secret 1 or 2 times before that. Anyone who had the ability would reveal there powers in order to save their father. Having Lois find out that this person with powers is Clark Kent even before he was superman ruined the whole movie. This is not how it should have been done.During the scene when a hologram Jor-el kept popping up and opening and closing doors on the spaceship was totally lame. I thought that the kryptonian suites were ridiculously stupid and they looked like mini transformers.<br />As he became superman the character wasn't special, and he didn't portray who superman really is. The Last hour of the movie was really terrible and full of a bunch of crazy s***! Boom boom! Fighting, and they totally wrecked the whole city. For a long time they are standing and fighting in front of a Sear's building, and it just seems like we got nothing going here let's advertise Sear's so we can get some customers to our stores. In this film it is all dark and gloomy like they were trying to make a dark knight movie which was a total disaster. Pretty much everyone except his parents hated him whether he was Clark Kent or Superman. Even Lois lane didn't like him as either Clark or as superman. She and Supes had a big lame kiss at the end that didn't really fit because she shows no liking of him. The Lois lane in the comics and movies goes crazy over superman and is madly attracted but not in this one Oh did I mention they only called him Superman once or twice!I found the new suite to be okay but I didn't love it. If you compare the suite with the ones in the Spider man movies, it is the same thing with the colors and scaly fabric, take off the spider and put on an S. I am not hung up on the original superman movies and do think that some parts are boring, but the first two were good examples of what superman stands for. What they should have done with the Man of Steel was recreated the original superman movie up to the point were he becomes superman and than created what ever movie they wanted but no crap. They could have even still used the same suit and the same actors but actually made a wonderful memorable movie like they did a long time for the older generation. What can you expect about the movie is that this is not the beloved superman we have always known, the story is mostly completely told backwards and there is no kryptonite, fortress of solitude, lex luthor, and jimmy olsen. There is also is no love, passion, and or some one to look up too. Finally this is just not a good movie. Man of steel is essentially so jam-packed and busy that it's an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, a war movie, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other. This is a really messed up superhero movie using the superman characters, but this is not Superman we have known for 75 years. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster the creators of superman have watched this movie from heaven and are completely ashamed of what has become of their 75 year old superhero that they had created.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome read! What a thrilling, and exciting book series. The main characters intrigue you, and bring you into their drama as it unfolds. A MUST read.
B0015442YU|2.0|I am glad that I got this as a free premium through Amazon Prime - I'd be very unhappy if I had actually PAID for it...<br />I love all of Thomas Harris' books, and the movie &#34;Silence of the Lambs,&#34; but this was really bad / didn't even pretend to follow the book except in the most general way.<br />I understand that a movie can not possibly include all of the detail that the original book had, but this is ludicrous.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so addictive.  I couldn't put it down once i started playing.  I can't wait for updates so i can keep playing
0679809015|5.0|This product is perfect entertainment to throw in a diaper bag!  It is a small book that has a lot of pages and a lot of flaps for the little one to open.  My two year old now can make the animal noise for each animal and still loves the book.  A definite MUST for travel!  Plus, you can't beat the price!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|Want to go on vacation without leaving your home? well...this CD is your ticket to an Island paradise destination. It 's a calming collaboration of a gifted man's music to share!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I just never seemed to get into this book.  Not that it was bad, but I expected it to be better.  I finished it and was glad when it ended ..
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is  a great tool to keep with your knife.  Have used it to sharpen two knives.  Easy to used and has places for ceramic sharpener as well as a file sharpener.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I have to admit, I am not a 30 Rock fan or a liberal, and I did enjoy this book until I felt like Fey started explaining her career choices.  Do I think her impression of Palin was uncanny, yes - did I find it offensive, not really?  I felt like she was pandering to both sides of the political aisle with all of the explaining (read: excuses).  I enjoyed hearing about her personal life, and the obstacles she had to overcome (greek hips, for one - I feel ya sister)... but when she &#34;made it&#34; at the end, I don't know, I wasn't nearly as interested and I didn't find it as funny as I think she intended it to be.<br /><br />Good book & i'd recommend...especially for the &#60;$10 price tag.
B003WMA7BU|5.0|I saw the movie first (usually I read first then watch) and then read this. Absolutely loved them both, but the books are always better.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Very fun to play. Everyone goes to this game and we laughs when playing. The picture is amazing. Fun for all ages
B00BN2CY7G|2.0|Snooze fest.  Bon Jovi fan but this is a snoozer.  Maybe the lyrics and storytelling is here but by the time the singing starts I'm already bored.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I think the whole series of diary of a wimpy kid is the funniest series in the world I also hope other readers enjoy it. Written by my child.
B00ATPVA78|5.0|The storyline and graphics were outstanding. I could not put the game down due to the suspense. The interactive elements and puzzles are a challenge.
B00005K424|5.0|This is a great game. Very fun. Educational. Easy to play fast and slow. Great for two people. Lots of strategy
B006MW3UZW|5.0|There is not one detail overlooked in this outstanding series. It is historically correct and the acting is superb, especially Maggie Smith's.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I got this on Amazon even though it said it was not compatible with either of my devices (Kindle Fire and Galaxy Tab 10.0 2) since I though I would take a chance it would work on the Galaxy Tab tablet.  After all, it was free.  When I tried to download to the Galaxy Tab, Amazon would not allow the download because the game was not 'compatible' with my device.  I went to Google Play and found the game there for free only Google Play said it was compatible on my Samsung SII phone AND my Samsung Galaxy Tab tablet.  I downloaded it from there and it works just fine on the Tab.  Not sure why there is a difference in getting it from Amazon versus Google Play, but it is a great game and worth playing.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I had so much hope for this movie! Being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series, I was really hoping for more exciting action especially given the length of the movie. To my disappointment it wasn't as great as I wanted it to be :(<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars only because of my love for the series and my childhood love for the Hobbit.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Watch out, this game is addicting... Connecting the dots without overlapping the pipes can be tricky! Give. It a try!
1881273873|4.0|This was a good read. As a single person, it does help to understand what your language is and how to appeal to someone with another language. It certainly helps to make dating much easier, knowing the other person's language.  I'd definitely recommend this book.
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|I didn't like this movie much, but my husband did.  It's pretty graphic and goofy.  I will give it a plus for creativity, but I don't recommend it unless you are majorly into zombies.
B00CFOGCAG|3.0|I really enjoyed this game, it's got just the right combination of mindless button-mashing and smart timing and skill, with a fun sense of humor and a great feeling of satisfaction, punching your way through all your problems.  Unfortunately, it seemed to really dislike actually functioning, and would often quit unexpectedly after a good run, eliminating all my progress.  Repeatedly punching your way through the exact same goals gets tiring really quickly.
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This is a good movie and worth paying to see.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it, and I recommend it!
B0058HDT2G|5.0|I really love her. My selly~ This album is really good. And the Deluxe Edition has 4 more tracks. So I recommand this verson~
B005M5OSBK|5.0|Pink Martini brings a breath of fresh air to the world of music. To say they are innovative is an understatement. Their repitoire includes virtually music from virtually every continent. The arrangements are fresh and illustrate the highly competent orchestra members.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the greatest game! Of all the time it is a great thing of the time.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Absolutely  one of the best mafia movies of all time. Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci do an amazing job on screen bringing these characters to life.
B000O5B4C4|5.0|This movie is very good! Michael Douglas makes the perfect villian, and makes you like and fear him at the same time.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|If you ever wondered what happened to Peter Pan and the gang when you finished with the story? Well wonder no more. This is a great, and under-appreciated movie starring Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and Bob Hoskins, all fine performances. I have watched this for many years, and now get to watch it with my young Children, and I still shed a tear or two.......
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a really fun game! You get to surf on top of trains and you get to see different locations.
B00847KFDS|3.0|Having said that, this album is going to take a little getting used to for me because I'm so used to John's version of these songs.  Most of the artists he's chosen here I have great respect for - but they're not John - and so I am glad I have this album, but it makes me realize how much I am totally satisfied with the original version by him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this great very much it's fun emerging cool and horse's I love horse's so I love this game I think you should l d play if
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great action, great scenery, overall well put together.  Like always, Bond takes it back to what matters, the old school.
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|It is an amazingly fun game to play, but you only get to play about 2 missions then you have to pay 4$!!!  For the rest of the missions.  So it's a great game to try, but don't get addicted, or you will HAVE TO PAY!
B00CLH1PHM|4.0|It is Oscar night and people all around the globe - fans and Hollywood A-Listers alike - wait with baited breath for the ceremony to begin. Tonight, Sir Michael Brookes, one of the most admired and courteous actors ever to grace Hollywood, is nominated for two Academy Awards. If he wins both the 'Best Actor' and 'Best Supporting Actor' Awards, Sir Michael will have an unprecedented six Academy Awards to his name...<br /><br />Meanwhile, sitting alone in his dingy London flat, is Terry Sparkes - Sir Michael's biggest fan and a fellow actor. As Terry watches the ceremony, he is completely unaware that this evening's telecast will change his life forever.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story very much. There was a twist to it that I wasn't expecting. I give the story an A! I'm looking forward to reading Duncan Whitehead's next book some time soon.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Downloaded and then nothing happened, the app is there but the game doesn't play... It didn't work for me, I have a kindle fire
B008JFUMDS|5.0|Loved Now You See Me!!  Bravo Ed Solomon for really good writing and a clever story!!  Superb cast and acting and a very fun time at the show!!
B005KELW26|5.0|I love it.  It is hard enough to protect my kindle fire, it sits up straight so I have my hands free while at work on break eating a snack and reading at the same time. I love this one better than the other one I had bought. Will replace it with the same kind again if needed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Have many books from King, like the rest this book keeps me reading all night. Cannot put it down. Great reading.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My dad ALWAYS plays this game.So I wanted to try it.It is amazing! You should try it!<br />What I think about it:amazing cool amazing!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I really enjoy using this calculator. It has all you will ever need in a calculator, it is very helpful to me.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Challenging game. I enjoy it so far. Why do these have a minimum word count? Makes no sense to me.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Lies all Lies! Angry birds REO is not available without ads! If you pay for it you will still get ads! This is the largest ad generator in the Angry Birds Line!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun game. Simple instructions and playthrough is smooth. Nice graphics. I would definately recommend this game for kids or horse lovers.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This alarm clock is really great.  Eye appealing, easy to use and offers great features.  I just wish there were more than three alarm settings with the free version... otherwise I love it!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|walking into the new duels of the planeswalker fully ready to play the new sealed campaign on my note 2 and I am stunned on how beautiful it looks and how much fun it is. here's to playing sealed all the time
B0084FMCI6|4.0|Nice looking, fairly comfortable. Only problem is with the heel strap at times causes a bit if friction. In general, very good though!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent book, hard to put down.  Surprising ending.  As with all John Grisham books, just makes you want to get into another book right away.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I'm not sure if I would enjoy these books more if I were younger, or if they were written better. I am an adult in my mid 20s so it could be both I suppose. Regardless, I have purchased and read all but the last two because it IS interesting enough to come back for me, curious what might happen next. Its not a bad price for a light read.
B0035LJY6C|3.0|everything you member from the 90s and more. Was a good watch and glad amazon had it available on insta
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|Game isn't challenging or even very entertaining. Probably best suited for entertaining a young child, not recommended for adults looking for an engaging game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. Its fun and is very challenging to me. Once you start playing this game you get addicted to it! Its awesome! :) :) ^&bull;^ ^&deg;^ &lt;3
B002BVQU5A|5.0|This is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen in a long time!  It is a very simple story-line, unclouded by explicit scenes or excessive foul language( I recall mainly one badly offensive curse word).  And Johnny Depp's performance is so natural.  It's a really great movie, that will certainly touch your heart!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|o my God this game is way better than I imagined. the graffics are amazing. the ocean etc. so life like. super addicting. no crazy ads. FREE they don't try to sell you everything under the sun. you can choose between tilt or touch controls. I use touch. works for me. I have this on my kindle fire and onmy samsung galaxy s2.
B00CFITJKW|5.0|I think that the flight simulator is the best app I have ever played. I can't stop playing it. This game is the best app ever.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|An interesting sequel to Phantom of the Opera. It's kind of nice to catch up with the characters, you know?
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is an awesome album and Adele at her best. I think it is a collection of her best works to date.<br />This is a purchase that would be considered money well spent and you can not beat the fact that about<br />30 seconds after you pay you have the music to enjoy listening to, it's a win win, buy, listen, and enjoy.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|If you try to update an it says PARSE ERROR don't uninstall this app it can be fixed. If you uninstall then reinstall you start at square one. It isn't an amazon issue it is Google changing your app setting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Had to watch an episode a day to catch up. Couldn't stop watching & went on immediately to season 3. A must see!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Peter Jackson has a way with this material. The way he brought in other source material to tell a broader story than just the one in the Hobbit was masterful. With new characters, heros to root for and villains to hate, the film moves at a good pace and leads naturally to the sequel. If you enjoyed the Lord of the Rings series then this is a must watch.
145210655X|5.0|Very clever!  My kids loved it, and even more so when I used a Darth Vader voice on the movie lines!
B006VJMZXY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this page turner .... story was plausible and riveting - didn't want to put the book down, totally engrossing. Very interesting knowing that this story is based on historical facts.
B005IML464|5.0|I purchased this set to get the Symphonies 1-9, the other 8 CDs are basically a bonus. The symphony recordings may not be the most highly-rated ones conducted by Karajan but all the other music included more than makes up for it.<br /><br />Pros - Great value for your money, a few recordings included that aren't often seen (ex. Missa Solemnis), a fine selection of overtures and concertos.<br /><br />Cons - minimalist packaging (CDs in sleeves in a box), 1970's recordings not quite up to other Karajan cycles.<br /><br />Summary - This is a great set for a casual classical listener. An audiophile may want to look at the 1963 Karajan-Beethoven symphony cycle instead.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|This movie quite simply made my day. Not for the children, this movie includes gore, cursing, incredibly beautiful people, more gore, nudity, sex, and a little bit more gore. Nothing fancy or refined here, just a fun hack & slash movie. Loved it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and not so hard you want to tear your hair out. Also a good game for kids, to get their minds going.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Our youngest grandchild requested this movie to watch on our recent trip to Disney World.  We had all seen it before, but the girls enjoyed watching it again.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I love the file cabinet style packaging.  So far, we've only watched the first DVD but found no problems with it.
1932735410|4.0|i like it.  hope the questions are more like the real exam.  wish the disk had more than 25 questions.  oh well, that is how they make money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A challenging game for those who like puzzle solving.  It makes you think!  I've played some other games of this type but eventually gave them up as they became so difficult.  But this has just enough of a difficulty level to keep it I teresting but not impossible.
B00BZBP44K|5.0|Ben Kingsley does a great job.  This show does a great job of protraying the difficulties and successes of Gandhi.  The man lived an amazing life and had insights into life that few people ever will.  I think everyone could learn from his example.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Loved this movie! It is a great family movie with amazing animation. Disney has once again made a movie that will be around for generations :)
B000002AD0|4.0|i have been a fan of santana since i was a teenager in the early 70's. i met a kid from venezuela who listened to santana all the time and turned me on to their cool mix of latin percussion and rock and roll. at the time i wasn't aware they had been playing around the west coast for years. this cd is an early version of the santana blues band and sounds great. they quickly became one of bill grahams favorite bands and played with many of the famous west coast bands of the time. i guess you could say the rest is history !! if you want to hear what they sounded like in 1968 get this cd because the whole show is outstanding !! another reviewer downgraded this cd because it does not compare favorably to woodstock ;;;; well that came later , this is a year earlier and gives a fine glimpse into how the band evolved over and through this exciting time in their history. if you are a fan you will enjoy it because it's different and fun to hear these early years. cheers !!!
B004WGIXX4|2.0|That kinda sums it hope. Would not advise anyone I like to rent or view. Bad Boring waste of time
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is hauntingly interesting, could not put the book down. Could not stop thinking about the characters in the book. Khaled Hosseini is an amazing writer and will look for his next book.
B000V6984M|4.0|The original (non-remastered) version of Slippery When Wet by Bon Jovi was far better than the remastered copy.  Some things are just better left alone.  It's like listening to a remastered copy of a 1950s piece of music.  It was supposed to have pops and crackles from the wear and tear of the record changer (remember, back then they were stacked and played as groups causing faint crackles from the rubbing together while spinning).  Had I never heard this or had the piece not brought back memories, it would be great in the new format.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love Game of Thrones because unless you have read the book is very difficult to know what is going to happen next on the series. I avoided watching Game of Thrones the first two seasons because i thought it was this all fantasy world with magicians but I decided to give Game of Thrones a chance because i thought it was and &#34;epic&#34; TV show. I am glad i decided to watch the first episode of season three because  the storyline was great and so I got hooked right from the start and decided to watch the series right from the beginning.Even though is not what i was expecting when I decided to star watching Game of Thrones believe these series is great.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a fabulous story which was  both moving and personally fulfilling. As one who loves fast cars and dogs(I do believe I have an Enzo living in my house)), this story  brought  me back to my younger days of journeying  to formula races and longing to own a red Ferrari!  Oh,  the sound of that motor!!! The tears flowed many times throughout this wonderful story.  KUDOS to the author!
B004LROUNG|2.0|Although I have quite a few dollars to spend, neither my Kindle nor my Android phone are able to download this book. Keeps on telling me it will download but it won't happen. Have even called in to get my gift card account as the primary payer but with no resolution to the problem. Ruben Zamorano
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Finally, something somewhat interesting to listen to. People are hardly ever ready for that. And finally, Mr. West might actually start proving he's as godalmightycool as he says he is. Win.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Jewel Legends: Tree of Life is a very fun game to play.  It got me hooked!  When I finished one level, it's hard not to continue onto the next and so forth!
B006YTTVHO|1.0|I read through a portion of this book thinking it would offer some good advice but very soon lost interest.
0920668372|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my son who is now 19 and it remains one of my favorite children books.
030758836X|5.0|This book touches on so many emotions; love, hate, terror, manipulation, revenge, lust, justification, presumption. It is a puzzle within a puzzle, not a traditional who-done it. The ending was a surprise, and after I reflected on it a while, a good one, because it could spawn another great story from this one.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Good game<br />On my tablet it will not resize to fit screen and I can't use power ups so half the fun is taken away<br />Using archos carbon
B00005T7I1|5.0|Brings the cartoons to life in Sondheim music, Madonna crooning, color galore, great editing, Cast of Giants!  Can't go wrong for entertainment.

0545265355|5.0|A thrilling book series for any one who enjoys post apocalyptic fiction. I would recommend this to any one who is interested in the twilight series. well written and easy reads. Well done!
1932735410|4.0|Project Management is a complicated and hard subject.  This book takes a different approach from the PMI Handbook which I think will help most people.  The more ways you learn something, the more likely it is to stick.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Was kind of bored with this book...definitely not as good as the last. Hope the next book to come out is better

0786838655|5.0|The Percy Jackson series is one of my all time favorite series. Though written for middle school aged children, the books appeal to children, teenagers, young adults, and not so young adults. They are, quite simply, amazing. The characters are more lifelike than just about any other author's I can think of (Lindsay Buroker being another excellent example). Percy's narration is clever, hilarious, snarky, and maintains a very realistic voice for an early teens boy. The world building is interesting, unique, and thorough without being overwhelming or tedious. The plots are well executed and you see characters develop (and not just physically) throughout the series.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it: Percy and most of the rest of the demigod children are ADHD and Dyslexic. Riordan takes these challenges and turns them into advantages in Percy's new reality. I love that - a reminder that not all of us are wired the same way, and that can be a good thing. Also, in a later series, one of the demigods is lactose intolerant. Represent!<br /><br />Something you see quite often with book series written for this age group is that the themes and characters become more mature and darker as the series progresses. Here there is a little bit of that, but not nearly as much as, say, Harry Potter. A child who can handle the first book emotionally will be able to handle the last book as well, which is not necessarily the case with the Harry Potter series. The bottom line is that I cannot think of anything negative to say about these books. Some books you just read with a big smile on your face, and for me, the Percy Jackson and the Olympians books are way at the top of that list.<br /><br />**Review originally posted at Lector's Books**
030758836X|3.0|When I started this book I was very excited. A new murder mystery plot with a young NYC couple. The beginning was great! The middle dragged a bit. Towards the end, there was a great plot twist. And I thought wow what a great twist to end the book. However the twist did not come to full fruition. It left me disappointed and just plain angry! Angry at the characters and at the author. It did leave a great Segway to a second book.
B0017VG69U|5.0|its star trek you can never go wrong, I have all 3 and enjoy them all . season 2 is my favorite..
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Classic Gaiman. If you like Gaiman, you'll probably love this. If not, then probably not. And, if you've never read Gaiman then I recommend trying him with this short and brilliant novel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app. In my opinion it is a better app than the weather channel app. It is more accurate and easier to get radar on.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|The acting is good, the story line is wonderful and presented a way that makes you totally understand the characters.  We watch it over and over at our house.  Well worth the money and time.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|I would think anyone would like this CD. It is very moving.. strong and tells the story very well.Excelent.<br />Waiting for the movie.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|a very enjoyable CD good songs good orchestration good voice it is nice to see a veteran still top notch
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I concur with most of the reviews on this page:  The music and performance on 'Queensryche' are absolutely top-notch and a true return toform.  'Queensryche' genuinely harkens back to the 'Rage for Order' album in its vibe and performance.  Additionally, James 'Jimbo' Barton's recording, production, and mixing suit the album very well -- it was a wise decision to bring back the producer of such landmark albums as 'Operation:Mindcrime', 'Empire', and 'Promised Land'.  New vocalist Todd La Torre proves to be more than worthy.<br /><br />My real problem with 'Queensryche' lies not in the content or mixing, but in the mastering.  Unfortunately this album has been brick-walled to the point that it is difficult to listen to.  The song 'Redemption' suffers the worst, but the problems are present from start to finish.  On some songs, the mastering is so hot that you can only hear a wall of noise with distortion-laden vocals on top.<br /><br />Make no mistake -- 'Queensryche' has the potential to be album of the year for 2013.  I just sincerely hope that the album gets a remaster that gives justice to the content.  Thanks for reading my review.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Blood Song is easily one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. This book held my interest the whole way through and I cannot wait for the next installment. You will not be disappointed.
B0030V0PEW|3.0|Dr Gawande presents an essential concept.  Using the viewpoint of his profession makes it easier to grasp the importance of checklist to focus a team into an efficient system.  Had an aviator presented the same idea it would be too easy to disregard - we expect that in them. To learn of the benefits of checklists in medicine and finance makes it clear they can be applied effectively in many more situations
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|There's nothing else like it on TV today! Great look and feel and tons of suspense. Emmy worthy cast and writing.
0321701763|5.0|Very good book for a new learner! I will recommend it. you will be amazed of what you will learn with it. Buy It $
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this game so many different options to play. the thing good is its free but the games are not hard and you don't have to pass the game to go on to open more games.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My son can't get enough of this video.  The animation is fantastic and the story is great.  The minifig it comes with is a great bonus as well!
0425263924|4.0|I liked this installment of the Crossfire series & am thrilled there will be 5 books instead of 3. After the tension, drama & separation in Reflected in You Gideon and Eva needed time to recover and some happiness. There was plot in this story (Eva's parents, Nathan's bracelet, Megumi, Cary & his love life, NTM the Gideon & Eva stuff).<br /><br />I've never read a book by Sylvia Day that I didn't like, this one included. I think some people are just impossible to please. If you don't like the book, get your money back. Day isn't hurting for readers! She knocked DAN BROWN out the #1 UK best seller list in 3 weeks! There are a million books in the world, go read something else if you don't like these.
B0074PNCRM|3.0|Teenage 'love' between 2 dying cancer victims. the plot was too predictable, the characters not quite believable. But I did finish the book, mostly when I get bored I don't.
B009L32R5I|5.0|Steve gained momentum from the previous Revisted album. The re-recordings bring back memories from the original Genesis and solo tracks. The 12 string acoustics to Entangled and Supper's Ready are my highlights. Well done Steve.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Excellent continuation in the series. Juicy, sexy and great story line.<br />Not fond of the drop-off ending...I am excited for more!
B00BIQU1K4|5.0|Who would have thunk it? Steven Wilson and Alan Parsons - Two creative forces on the same project (no pun intended). I took the album title too literally as a sequel to Tales of Mystery and Imagination. I predict this album will earn a Grammy nomination for best surround sound. Congrats!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I received my CD about 5 days ago and I have listened to over and over again.<br />With each listen you hear something new and it is fantastic from beginning to end.<br />I still have not picked a favorite cause there is not one bad song on the Cd.<br />Its been a long wait to finally hear music that is simply amazing again.<br />I indeed have fallen in love with Queensryche all over again.<br />Way to go guys you have succeeded in bringing Queensryche back to the sound<br />that had been missing for years.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|It is a very astonishing book - family saga - and tragedy. Very well written and very delicately put into a novel. The whole tragedy of this family goes under your skin. You can feel the sadness, the happiness and the poetic message through the whole book. I highly recommend it. Congratulations to Khaled Hosseini<br />Thea Pijpers
B003YFIUW8|5.0|VERY GOOD. Story told as a child would see things. Somewhat forgotten in everyday life. Kept me reading to see what happens.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|the book helped with what I was looking for but could be,better with visual representations  of the words<br />the book was ok
B00CWY76CC|5.0|mind working keeps u thinking and cant wait to see the next level.  please hurry and make more of these f.me n my grandaughter. so we can play more together
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I take this with me on my kindle and on my phone.  It's a great tool to set the mood for writing or meditating
B0091REZMW|5.0|I'm addicted to finding the hidden objects and the quests definitely add to the fun! wish there were more ways to get diamonds or speed up energy...
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Bluffing is a lot of fun, and the rounds are fast so getting kicked out isn't that bad. Super fast to finish and fast moving. Nice little filler.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Full of expletives. That is the only thing consistent througout the movie. Did not catch that from the preview or the description.
193700788X|5.0|I was delighted with \\"Dead Ever After\\" and thought it was a fitting conclusion for the Sookie Stackhouse series. Obviously, it didn't appeal to those fans who preferred a different ending. But then, such fans are NOT the author. This is NOT a communal work. Charlaine Harris tied all the loose strings together by bringing back characters from the earlier books. And like old friends, it was a pleasure seeing many of them one last time. But she also brings back some unexpected villains, who all get their comeuppance in one way or another. And Sookie herself gets the possibility of a lifetime of happiness at last.
1594744769|4.0|This was a good read for many ages. Not a very lengthy read, but nice for a weekend of leisure.
B0058O84G0|4.0|I learned about he first world war in history class a long time ago. History was written by the people who came out victorious and using the opportunity to clear themselves of any possible blame. Follett shows clearly that there was a lot more to it and that outdated feudal thinking lay at the basis of it all. It is also clear, that the vindictive peace at the same time made WW II almost a foregone conclusion.
0399226907|4.0|My two year old grandson likes this book a lot.  His Daddy, who owned the original, found the small size and the coloration of the illustrations disappointing.  Since the original is not available this is the next best thing and the board book format is good for little hands.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|The chosen way of telling the story allows the reader an insight from various angles. That is extremely interesting, but at the same time it is somewhat unbelievable that so few people play such a critical role.
0738702994|5.0|Great info on how to do a card reading, and how to interpret the cards.  Very beautiful cards by the way!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I first got into Queensryche with \\"Empire\\". I loved \\"Empire\\" and I thought the band hit its pinnacle with \\"Promised Land\\". They had commercial elements but at the same time stood apart in the songwriting department. Enough prog and enough chunk was left to impress me greatly. I got into the earlier albums later but \\"Empire\\" and \\"Promised\\" will always be my favorites. Then the decline started and it was not pretty from what I've read. I bought \\"Hear in the now Frontier\\" the day it came out...and I've never bought another Queensryche album since. I heard bits and pieces from following albums but nothing that resembled the QR that I liked so I just never bothered. Then like just about everyone else I heard about the band imploding but honestly didn't care all that much since the band had been off my radar for over a decade. I found the stories of financial abuse as well as physical abuse to be fascinating but I really wasn't all that interested in new music. Then I heard \\"Redemption\\" and was an old fan brought back all over again. Could the QR of old really come back after one bad album after another? Could this new guy really replace \\"The Voice\\" Geoff Tate? The answer surprised me as I'm sure it will surprise many of you....yes. A very simple yes. The band hasn't sounded this good since \\"Promised Land\\". Let's dive in shall we?<br /><br />The album opens with \\"X2\\" an instrumental, ambient piece. Brilliant, exciting...a great way to kick start the new QR.<br /><br />\\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\" is the first proper track and it's a Hell raiser. Military style drums open to the dual guitar harmonies that we grew to love and grew to miss over the last decade. Instead of strutting out Todd and his piercing high notes, we're treated to a somewhat restrained but brilliant performance. A puzzling way to start an album with such a mellow opener but wait....the band has some surprises in store...read on...<br /><br />\\"Spore\\" An almost sci fi feeling song. Very proggish and experimental. One of my favorites easily. In a word, brilliant.<br /><br />\\"In This Light\\" VERY reminiscent of the Empire album. Powerful and catchy. Has a great chorus. This SHOULD be the first official single from the album as it has \\"hit\\" written all over it.<br /><br />\\"Redemption\\" The first song the new QR introduced us to a while back. It's got it all, the dual guitars, thumping bass, drumming as only Scott can deliver and of course the beast TODD.<br /><br />\\"Vindication\\". Todd really shows off his pipes on this one. Amazing chorus. The rest of the song really reminds me of a VERY heavy Rush. Odd beats but very catchy, another of my favorites.<br /><br />\\"Midnight Lullaby\\". Another instrumental, mood piece. Creepy...something I'd expect to hear from the group Nox Arcana.<br /><br />\\"A Word Without\\". YES, a Promised Land era sounding song. Very mature but very dark. Todd kills it on this one. Beautiful orchestration. My favorite on the album.<br /><br />\\"Don't Look Back\\". Another barn burner song. Not a good song to listen to while driving unless you enjoy getting speeding tickets.<br /><br />\\"Fallout\\". This is another song that's been out for a while. Excellent song, strong dual vocals, guitars, killer lead. Catchy...love it.<br /><br />\\"Open Road\\". The last song on the album (sniffles). A power ballad. Beautiful vocals and guitar harmonies. A great way to end the album.<br /><br />Let's address some other things. The production.......flawless. Jimbo really brought back the QR that's been gone for a long time now. Drums, guitars, bass and vocals are all absolute perfection. I wish this new version of QR all the best in the world. I never thought I'd witness such an amazing rebirth but here it is. As for Geoff.....I was a fan for many years and still am. I wish him nothing but the best with his career. Sometimes divorces are messy but necessary and this was one of them. Toddryche has come out stronger for it. One other complaint I've heard has been the albums length. Ithink a shorter album was necessary for a few reasons. As a reintroduction, shorter songs work much better. Radio play will also be a factor so shorter songs are a great idea. I like shorter albums better. It's short, sweet and leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />One other thing I feel compelled to write about is Todd. Comparisons will be endless between him and Geoff. Here are my thoughts. Todd is brilliant, period. Skilled, the man can hit the highs as well as the lows but he never comes across as arrogant and his performance is never flash over substance. He really is the best thing that could have happened to QR. Yes, he resembles Geoff in many ways but he brings an element to QR that is neither derivative nor cheesy. He brings something that has been lacking for far too long...class.<br /><br />To summarize the album... Brilliant. Amazing. An almost impossible comeback from a band that's been musically dead for over a decade. QR is back and the future's never been brighter. Welcome to the fold Todd and welcome back QR. If you're like me and you fell away after \\"Here In The Now Frontier\\"...then do yourself a favor and pick this up. The band from the 80's didn't just come back. This is the new and improved QR that brought all the elements that made them great and updated them for a new age. Highly recommended.think a shorter album was necessary for a few reasons.

B0018RFLQ2|4.0|Well written and well acted.  It works as a film as well as a learning tool for kids about what in life is truely important.  Winning comes from within.  Its not just about awards and accolades but about enjoying what you do and not letting the competition change who you are or who you want to be.  There will always be competition in life and you should be prepared to compete,and give your best effort.  But don't lose sight that there is more to life than always winning.
B0086700CM|5.0|it was easy to pick up and addicting to play. I LOVE IT!!!!!! I totally recommend it to gamers of all ages.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Funny, Smart, Sweet and action packed.  A perfect family film.  A great cast of older actors showing why they are still big name stars.
B00005JKGO|5.0|Like all the best of Fellini the twee hours really allow his themes and imagry to carry the story along in a surreal yet familiar setting. Not to mention the glorious B&W cinematography and Anouk Aimee and Anita Ekberg.
0679805273|5.0|Bought for my sons graduation. Had all the guests at his party sign it, turned out super cute. Thx for super fast shipping, item was as described! Thank you
B006IR6NH8|3.0|It is what it is. Takes a little time to setup for different games, and does an OK job of control, considering it floats in air. It has a slight lag time and deadband not as adjustable as I would like. Not very good for serious racing games. OK for tooling around in games like TDU2.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Awesome gift for any Dr. Who fan! Super fast shipping and item was as described my daughter loved getting this for her birthday Thank you
B005H9B44A|5.0|What a fun show to watch! There was plenty of suspense and action (and a little humor) to make it interesting. Nothing obnoxious in it to keep me from watching it with my family.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed book two of this series the most. However, although book three depressed and frustrated me.... it was absolutely necessary to finish the series. I always wish for fairy tail endings, but the best part of these books is the shocking and frustratingly real, post traumatic stress disorder that<br />would inevitably follow being a participant in these \\"games\\" ... a fantastically shocking and inspiring trillogy.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Love it, very addictive, tried to put it down but kept going back. One of my favorite games, wish they had more like it. Maybe an recreation vehicle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is an awesome book about a girl who can not stay out of trouble but give the rebels a chance to end the hunger games!!!!!!
B003Y2XI8W|5.0|I just found this album and it speaks to my soul. I love music that has a story to it. This band is going to be big. Skip a dinner out and buy this album.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|I bought this Cardholder just have a way to get organized ... simply, and this is it. I love being able to just shove it in a pocket and go.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|if the new star trek movies is anything like this one then i', going to have to a bigger dvd case for the updated movies in this series thank you for the fast service
1609611543|5.0|Mind boggling.  Logical.  Life changing.  I dropped wheat cold-turkey and my food cravings are gone!  Beautifully written and easy to read.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love the show its epic! Each season gets better and better.  I can't wait for season 3 to come out.
B00821OX98|5.0|Hoping this series continues for a long time. Best I've seen in a long time. Wish there were more episodes per season!!
0756697875|5.0|My son is OBSESSED with Batman and we purchased this for him for his Birthday.  Very detailed, shows every Lego set ever made for Batman and even the year they were released.  Not an easy read for a kid though, so you may have to sit down with them and read it to them. Also, little fingers tend to turn pages quickly and we had a few pages rip on us because of that.  And added bonus, it comes with a Lego Batman figure.  Hours of entertainment.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still interesting and some stellar acting even though things are getting a little predictable.  The final scene of the last episode is a little disappointing.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|I purchased this movie for my 10 year old daughter because she was so obsessed with the trilogy book series. The movie however was unlike the books in some ways and not nearly as entertaining and suspenseful as the books.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I Love this game keeps me entertained for hours, but recently I could not get it on my kindle fire it kept saying to download again and could not download it again. so came on my computer to do so is Amazon having problems or is it just me? as I have not been able to get the other games that I have downloaded at an earlier date,
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who is currently obsessed with The Hunger Games.  I did not intend to keep as a Collector, so we took her out of the box.  Very detailed.  She has her bow and arrow and even the Mockingjay pin on her jacket.  I love that the doll still looks like Barbie and that they didn't try to make her look like the actress from the movie.  I'm not sure if Barbie Collector has made any other characters but if they have, I want them.  Excellent quality that you can expect from the Barbie line.  She also came with a stand to hold her and is completely bendable in her arms, wrists and knees.
B00821PCJS|5.0|A great drama that is all about the relationships that form under difficult circumstances. I'm hooked and can't get enough.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Love the present day spin that BBC has put on a great detective!  And the actors in the series are perfect for the roles!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard but challenging enough to keep interest. Like the variety of puzzles to be solved in each of the rooms.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|My first time to read Michael Connelly, saw the movie Lincoln Lawyer which was adapted from his writing so I thought I'd give him a whirl to see if I liked his books. Was not disapponted. Will read more.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been playing magic for many years. This is a perfect portable version of the game. Can't beat that promo either.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|The movie was very good, enjoyed the twist with the storyline. Great movie to watch with the family.  Will watch it again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun and addictive game!!!  recommend downloading and figuring out the challenges!!! great that this game is free!! ;)
0812983459|1.0|This book was described as being about hope.  It being the story of a journey, I assumed there would be progress, growth.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much hope or growth.  Harold started out dull and weak and at the end of his pilgrimage he was still drab and spineless.  He didn't learn anything.  The pilgrimage itself was disappointing: the people he met along the way weren't inspiring, they were annoying.  Can't imagine why it's called \\"an international bestseller\\".
B00CM9JKQM|1.0|What's wrong with people? Like every one else, I was really excited to finally hear GOOD music from this band again. They went on and on about having Jimbo and how it was gonna sound good and this and that, but the truth is that it sounds awful. This album sounds like the recent crap that Rick Rubin produced for Slayer. It's offensively loud, it distorts, it crackles, it's fuzzy... Remember those big choruses? Now they sound like quashed white noise. It's a shame because the songs are actually pretty good. If you're the kind of person that listens to music the right way (good stereo, not freakin' iPhone or computer speakers), you'll be sorely disappointed. If you're one of those dummies who doesn't know how to pay attention to anything, have at it. You ears will thank you later on in life.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|the first one they did was awesome. the next one was good but not as good as the first. this one is just about as good as the first album. a good purchase.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game! I have a hard time putting it down. It starts off real easy, then gets somewhat challenging on some levels but not impossible.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Erotic and a storyline that hooks you from the start - I can't wait to see where Sylvia Day takes us next.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I love the story line and the characters are all strong and you just never see the next curve coming.  I would like to see more shows like this on Amazon Instant.
B003G4W49C|5.0|the ending is a surprise and the writing is excellent.  for those who like space fight and learning about possible future schooling this is a must read book.  i hope the author writes a continuation along this line of reasoning.
B00000634J|4.0|I LOVE the song Imagine but not familiar with other songs. Surprised more don't click with me. I'm going through a divorce right now so a lot of the songs I had to skip after hearing the beginning about love.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|it seemed dull and clunky... it certainly wasn't lively.  I was very disappointed because I usually love this type of game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addicting game. Very fun.. fun for all. Couldn't put it down till I figured it all out. I recommend this game
B005IQ39AY|2.0|I thought this would be right up my alley and was terribly disappointed.  it just seemed annoying and boring.  couldn't wait to get rid of it
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My sister is crazy 4my little pony app, she is addicted to it ,I'm not I don't like it but she seems to enjoy it so I give it 5 stars.The thing I love about it is the money ,wise choice to add money :D
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I loved JT's first two albums. None of the tracks on this album caught my attention. In fact, I found most of them completely tedious. I listened to the first three tracks in my car during a ride and was already so disenchanted that I didn't try to listen to the rest of the album until several weeks later. Once I did, I continued to find myself underwhelmed. I haven't even listened to the rest of it. Did JT just throw this one together to attempt to satisfy fans? If you're totally fanatical, maybe you'll find a way to appreciate this album. I feel JT has done excellent work elsewhere, but I found 20/20 boring and sometimes grating.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|They just get better with age! This team sooo rocks!! I can watch them over and over! I love it!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|it keeps my kids busy. I love all the birds. it is easy but fun. it comes in 3 other games.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoyed this! can't wait for more levels. did have to google a walk thru to help on some levels, but thoroughly enjoyed this!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have only played a few levels of this game, but the levels are just challenging enough to be fun and short enough to play on a quick break.  I can see how this could get addictive!
B0015DWJX2|3.0|This book is an ok read, although not anything that held my attention for very long. It tended to be a little boring at times. I ordered the book since I will be visiting the Channel Islands in the future and I wanted a snapshot of that area. It did not fill that requirement as the book was more centered on the people of the island and their experiences during and after WWII.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|A beautifully told story of two siblings, of how their lives take such different paths and the people who influence their paths.  Another Khalid Hosseini masterpiece.
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I have been trying for 2 days to download and authorize this app with no success.  I had viber on my old android and had no problems.  Very frustrating!  I give up!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game.  It is so addictive.  Being a puzzle person this is right up my ally.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles.
B000FBFMFW|5.0|And to think I almost didn't get these books because I thought characters named after virtues was silly!<br /><br />I love Robin Hobbs books, but the Farseer trilogy onward are amazing.  If you don't meet FitzChilvary, Verity, Patience, Burrich, The Fool and Nighteyes you will be missing treasures!<br /><br />THE Liveship Traders books are not necessary to read these books, but if you do read them first you will have a much more in-depth understanding of them.<br /><br />I can only say read them you will never forget them.
B001POXA02|5.0|Excellent watch that I added a new band too . I really liked it and told friends about it Shipping was fine even when I used a sub contractor
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh at his typical best!  Nice songs exhibiting the full range of his amazing talent.  Good listening while driving or meditating.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I don't use for I-pad but I do have a Tablet that needs 2.0 Amp power and that what I'm using with. Plus I'm charging my Cell phone Samsung S II with out any problem.<br />The only complain I have that there is no LED's in for charging. I have one that when is plug in is red but when start charging is yellow and when finished charging it goes back to red. This way I know All is OK with this one the only way to know is on the device only. But is still good and have power to charge both devices. The other reviews that show 2 stars or 1 star they don't know what they doing. (NOT THE ONES THAT DO HAVE BAD ONE OR BROKEN ONE - this can happen to any one)
1577314808|5.0|This is a good book to read, and wherever I have been in public with it, it has generated conversation. It seems everyone else is reading it too at the moment.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love the graphics, easy game to play, storyline is good. You will need to use the zoom feature a lot but overall great game.
0061673730|5.0|A captivating book that will keep you thinking long after you've finished reading it. Well worth the time spent reading it.<br /><br />I am enjoying reading this book with the Bonsai Tree I have just purchased.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed the book very much so I would say more like 4 and 1/2 stars.  It is written in a different fashion than I was expecting but it was very enjoyable.  I am curious to see hiow this translates into a film.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|If you are considering reading this book, you've read the first two and know that the writing is no great shakes. The series is to literature as cotton candy is to food, and this book is even more empty than the others. That doesn't mean it's not worth your money. The story and characters are as engaging and fun as they are one-dimensional. The big problem with \\"Entwined with You\\" is that its story line is a pretty bland continuation of the former book, without any real climax, tension, or conclusion. It's basically a teaser for the next one which makes me feel a bit cheated, both financially and emotionally. I wish Sylvia Day had made like Stephanie Meyer and written the conclusion in one long book (referring to book four of the Twilight series here), focusing on her fans' happiness rather than her publishers'.
B008602KQI|4.0|Obviously the book is better but overall it was a good movie. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job portraying Katniss!
B0094K1MH2|1.0|We went in thinking any Steven Spielberg movie would be great, but soon learned it is a kid's cartoon. Turned it off at three minutes.

B005PK57IK|5.0|Good plot, great characters, usually gripping courtroom dramas.  An enjoyable series - wish I'd discovered it earlier.  Think it probably has something for everyone.

B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I think they have made a grave mistake in killing off Matthew. I think it is a cheap literary plot twister that is trite and overused:it just tells me that they are running out of ideas. I was quite fond of the actor and will miss him and his character. I have no desire to seek out the fourth season, if in deed, there will be one. Very poor choice on many levels. Now I understand why Connan Doyle had to resurrect Holmes. Will Matthew survive his injuries? Is he not dead just in a many episodes coma? Will any one care at this point? Very 'cheap shot&#34; at creativity. Shame on you all. I don't want to go to Scotland again, either.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like it, but it was interestings, and had both survival and family love.  I liked that.  I bought it for my mother and myself.

B007REV4T8|3.0|And yet, &#34;okay&#34; is well below par for a James Bond movie.  Film quality was fine.  Packaging was fine.  It arrived in a timely manner.  I don't know who wrote it, produced it, or directed it.  And I don't care.  The raw material was there.  Daniel Craig has comported himself well through two previous Bond films, but this movie seemed determined to crush the Bond image into the ground.  I've recommended to my friends that they should definitely skip it.  I didn't even bother trading it in, I just threw it away.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was really worth the money.  The game made you think outside the box on the puzzles.  Very challenging.  GOOD graphics Also
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I am not a critic, I don't go out to movies anymore, and I'm not even a big fan of Ben Affleck.  But, I found this movie enormously rewarding and entertaining.  I suspect some literary license was taken to heighten the suspense and some facets were obviously glossed over to reduce embarrassment to the politicians involved, but overall the accounting merged well with my memory of events.  It wasn't an Oliver Stone movie, but I don't think it intended to be.  I have recommended the movie to most of my friends, and have even hosted a couple movie nights at my house because I was so excited to share the experience and observe the various reactions.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I have no words to describe this book. Stay with the people you care about the most. Stay and get your butt down in a chair and read the book.<br />Stay.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been a fan of the Magic 2012 &amp; 2013 installments for the PS3. When I heard that Magic 2014 was being released for Android I was thrilled. I've downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. The sound &amp; graphics are equally as crisp as they are on my PS3. So far I've only played the single player campaign, but have been impressed. Play control is simple and fluid. With the touchscreen it feels more like playing with paper cards than it does with the PS3 controller. Deck customization is limited, but for casual play this is not a problem and will even the playing field in online multiplayer. The free app includes the tutorials without sound if you want to try before you buy. The price to unlock the full version is $9.99 which is worth every cent. I can imagine that playing on a phone could be a challenge with the smaller display, but playing on a tablet is spectacular! I would highly recommend this to newbie and seasoned veteran alike!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|cute game but glitches and force closes alot on my kindle fire. besides that it is a very good game ..
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It's a Pulitzer prize winner.  Several parts were very disturbing, but it was a great book, very readable and brilliantly written.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome and cool!!!!! It is also amazing to !! But everyone that rates this zero needs to quit you understand stand me guy's !!!!! Hope u enjoy the game!!!!!:)
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Where to start?<br /><br />First of all - the poor cast. James Franco, Michelle Williams, Mila Kunis etc. All fabulous actors made to look like amateur b movie actors with the lack of direction and poor script.<br /><br />The story was awful and I felt that they thought they could get by with CGI fanciness. I just wanted to slap them all until they shut up and I had to take two breaks while watching it because it was basically obnoxious.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG this book was so great! I loved reading it from a mans point of view! I laughed and smirked during the whole book! Bring on a sequel :-)
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|I just got constantly annoyed at all the screaming. I felt like John Lithgow and Jason Segal were underused. Could have been better. Had some funny moments.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I watched this movie like once before I actually bought it, and I love it. It arrived quickly, and the story is just great. Emma Watson having a role in it was awesome also. The dvd played perfect, the case arrived without a scratch. Very happy that I bought this and added it to my dvd collection.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was very interesting but it can be a little scary or gross at parts. I liked the part when  katniss met Bonnie and twill. I didn't like the part when president snow announced the quarter quell though. I would recommend this book to my friends because they love to read. Also to my sister
1781162646|1.0|This is a great read until the next-to-last page. Then King fills that page with an attack on former vice-president Dick Cheney. Out of context, jumping out of the novel, he screams about the inhumanity of Dick Cheney getting a heart transplant, instead of someone more deserving (anyone else).<br /><br />What the hell does this have to do with the novel? I read a horror fiction novel to escape from reality, not to have the author jerk me out of the story with his political proclamations about evil Republicans.<br /><br />King's political views are nauseous to me, but I still read the guy because he's a great writer. But lately, he's clearly going overboard and naming his targets. It's not enough that he presents plots throughout all of his novels that all evil can be traced to white males and their inhumanity to blacks, their violent treatment of homosexuals, their vile abuse of women and children.<br /><br />In \\"Under the Dome\\" King sticks it to contemporary politicians every couple of hundred pages. He attacks Lindsey Graham, which is odd, because this particular senator is full-blooded RINO (Republican In Name Only). King also puts in new combinations of adjectives - \\"...He wore a Republican sneer...\\"<br /><br />Instead of a 5, you get a 0, for this next-to-last page flatulence, Mr. King.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The character development in this book might just be the best I have ever read. The plot is rich and I recommend this book to anyone bored with their current reading.
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King but sometimes even he goofs. In this novella he hits it out of the park.  Even though it is in paperback form I'd still advise buying it.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|This is the best of all the BETWEEN THE PLUMS books.  I am still not a fan of Diesel and the supernatural aspects but it was better than all the other ones.  This was the last book  until Nov for me on this series which makes me sad.  I am caught up!!!
B00AF46Q5Y|3.0|It is a big story, with people traveling every which way and disappearing and returning years later. Even the main characters -- I think they are the main characters -- do that, while the Barrington family black sheep Hugo does his dirty deeds on the home front. Harry Clifton may be the heir to the baronetcy as a Barrington, and he wants to marry his love, Emma Barrington, but is held back by the possibility he may be Hugo's illegitimate son. Emma has Harry's son anyway, while Harry gets lost on the high seas, after which Emma embarks on a search for him in America. Dont ask! It's an okay read if you don't mind not knowing how anyone looks and are merely given hints on their physical appearance. And there is an offhand reference to Harry's mother Maisie's past as a prostitute that is another blind turn. Apparently, this is the middle book of a trilogy and readers are expected to have read the first book and know about all that stuff.  Only I hadn't.<br /><br />The narrative is carried along mostly like a newspaper article with as much flavor.  I admired the speech at the end, though, given by Lord  Preston in Parliament. The language was luvverly and makes me suspect Jeffrey Archer is most at home writing in that fashion.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved loved loved every word of this book. And being told from the  male perspective was PERFECT!!  The banter.. The sex!! the SMEXYNESS!!  All of it made a total complete perfect BOOK.. I cannot wait for more from Ms Chase!!!

B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is free. I got up to level 10 four times and started over until I learned that diamonds are my currency and the coins are for opening rooms. If you run out of energy, don't buy anything Just wait oernight and your energy will be restored. By around level 20, I thought, Okay, I'll buy 90 diamonds for four bucks. Let's see if that changes my odds. It didn't, not really, but I was empowered for a short time because I had so many silly diamonds.<br /><br />I sometimes worry about the whole premise of this game, particularly when I begin to look at my kitchen - or my life - as something clickable. C'mon, disappear me and see what happens. In some ways, mystery manor is a solid story and you're the detective. But, bottom line, it's about money. How many diamonds are you willing to buy to get to the next level? And exactly what kind of weirdness does that level hold, anyway? I am lured by the graphics, by the kind of zen state you enter when you click away at various rooms and level. Right now, I'm ticked off because I don't think it's possible to go beyond a particular level without spending money. If that's the case, I'll go back to the beginning, way back to square one, and will use my diamonds and energy more judiciously, just as I should in my real daily life.<br /><br />Someone, a group, has spent a lot of time figuring out this game and illustrating it with intriguing environments. It's you against them, really, a lot like life. Whatever you do, do NOT go the bank.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|With the controversy surrounding the band firing former singer Geoff Tate and his formation of a separate Queensrÿche entity, fans have been left to either pick a side, or wait it out and see which band would come out on top.  That wait is now over.<br /><br />This album is the greatest work that Queensrÿche has produced since Promised Land in 1994.  It is an incredible and powerful return to the form that made Queensrÿche a powerhouse of heavy metal.  Tate's childishly named FU album sold a paltry 5,500 copies in it's first week.  We shall see what this album is able to sell in its first week, but if what I am seeing on Amazon is any indication, it's going to be huge.  I saw it change from '4 copies left' to 'in stock but will take an extra 1-2 days to ship'.  And now it's saying 'Ships in 6-12 days'.  What? Sold out already?  Of course it is.<br /><br />Thank you Queensrÿche, for delivering what the fans have been waiting for.

If you love to think, you'll love this book.
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|** After several listens, I could clearly hear the clipping and static that some others have mentioned. It doesn't ruin the album but it does subtract from what is otherwise a near perfect album. I changed my rating to 4 stars.**<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Here's the most important part of this review... Even if this CD were made by some random band that I had never heard of, after the first listen I would be wondering \\"who is this? This kicks ass!\\"<br /><br />With all of the crazy stuff that's been going on with Queensryche over the past year or so, you would expect them to put out some rushed, half assed collection of songs that had either been sitting on the shelf or written by outside writers. But instead, somehow inbetween shows, they went into the studio and got to work creating not only their best CD in years but one of their best CDs EVER.<br /><br />The unexpected thing about these songs is that although they don't sound like rip offs of older songs, they sound almost like new companion pieces to other albums. Certain songs have a darkness to them that are clear reminders of Promised Land. Other sections are very reminiscent of Rage For Order (and I don't say that lightly... RFO is a masterpiece of atmosphere and complexity.) \\"In This Light\\" has the catchiest chorus of anything since Empire, it grabbed me the first time that I heard the teaser for this album. But there's a sense of urgency to \\"Fallout\\" and \\"Don't Look Back\\" that although may remind some of very early Queensryche, it also sounds like something from a completely new band. I don't know what to compare \\"Vindication\\" to, but it's a high point of the album. That bass line jumps at you and the angelic chorus is the perfect counterpoint to the relentless heaviness of the song.<br /><br />If you haven't heard the streamed version of this album, well... where have you been? The band was cool enough to invite you to hear the whole damn thing for FREE. But even then, I thought that every song was fantastic... EXCEPT the first teaser track \\"Redemption.\\" The chorus is perfect but the bridge is just clumsy and slows down the whole momentum of the song. I thought that the song was okay until I heard the rest of the CD. Everything else here is MUCH better.<br /><br />Two things that surprised me. First, the lyrics are very well written (isn't that supposed to be why they needed Geoff so much?)  At first listen \\"A World Without\\" just sounds like a moody dark track, but when you read the lyrics you begin to understand the powerful subject matter. They don't dumb it down, you have to put together the pieces and visualize each line before it becomes clear. Once you do, \\"Midnight Lullaby\\" isn't just an interlude, it's a necessary introduction to the story that you're about to hear. Secondly, Scott has become a MONSTER drummer. He's always been great, but there are so many flourishes and fills here and there that truly take every song to another level. It's not to the point that it gets in the way of the other instruments, it's just enough to make you say \\"Holy crap, how many hands does this guy have??\\"<br /><br />As for Todd, I'll admit, when I saw the first You Tube videos of his performances, I wasn't blown away. I mean let's face it, vintage Geoff Tate is a hard act to follow. But then I saw a quote from Michael Sweet, basically vouching for Todd's vocal abilities. If the voice of Stryper is impressed, then I had to have an open mind. Todd shines on this CD. On certain songs he sounds amazingly close to Geoff Tate (the chorus of \\"Don't Look Back\\" sounds like American Soldier era Tate), but on other tracks, he most definitely brings something else to the table. He sounds better ever time that I hear him. And the fact that he writes lyrics, and they are better than the crap that Tate has been spewing out lately, is just icing on the cake. He's a good fit for the band.<br /><br />Speaking of song writing, there's one last thing that needs to be addressed. Ever since Tate was kicked out of this band, there's been an ongoing controversy about who had written the classic Queensryche songs. Everyone knows that Chris Degarmo was a major piece that will forever be missed, but for anyone that's doubting the input of Michael, Ed and Scott, here's an excerpt from the November 1990 issue of Guitar World magazine. Chris DeGarmo is discussing the origin of the song \\"Resistance\\" from Empire:<br /><br />\\"Michael had a real cool, aggressive piece of music. He played this thing for me and I helped arrange it... It only took a second for Scott 'One Take' Rockenfield to blaze off his track.... We communicate very thoroughly on song ideas before we record them.\\"<br /><br />Queensryche is a band. When you read the song writing credits in the liner notes, that's mainly the people that are responsible for the lyrics and melody. If you think that Geoff Tate was writing Scott's drum parts on Mindcrime, listen to the drums on Tate's \\"F.U\\" album verses the drums on this CD. Then listen to the bass lines. Then listen to the guitars. There's a reason why Tate recently stated that he doesn't \\"know what the Queensryche signature sound is.\\"<br /><br />Mister Tate, THIS is the signature Queensryche sound. It's a damn shame that you couldn't be a part of it. But I think that the rest of the band just reassured us that we'll be fine without you.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is awesome and very addicting.  You can play solo or multiplayer online.  It is definately worth the download!  Give it a try.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|This isn't just better than Tate's Queensryche (not a difficult feat), it's not just good for having a new singer, etc.  It is a good--great, actually--Queensryche album (period)!  If this is the new Queensryche, keep giving me more!  Can't wait to catch them on tour!  (By the way, I got a cool patch with my CD.  Not sure if this is a limited time thing or not, but it was a cool extra.)

B005DJREJS|5.0|I dislike that this series portrayed the adults as oblivious, and the counselor's inappropriateness made me cringe.  The creator was after all influenced by John Hughes.  However, I love the dialogue and the realistic portrayal of the angsts and joys of adolescence.  And eventually the adults as also the teenagers evolve, making them less of caricatures.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a child with my parents and loving it.  Michael Jordan was really and still is such a icon.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love games that provide puzzles to solve. This one gets to be more difficult with each level but it's not just more of the same. You have to look for clues and solve problems and puzzles. It's not easy! I hope when new levels come out it doesn't just keep getting harder. OK if the clues are there to learn as you go.<br /><br />Find clues and solve puzzles. It's not easy! It challenges you to look at things creatively. Each level gets more difficult. I hope the new levels that come out continue to challenge in creative ways.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Fun game with good graphics, smooth game play, and easy interface makes the time go by. Addictive and at times challenging, I definitely recommend this game.

Yes, THE ACTIVIST is described as being a young adult novel, but, even as an adult, (retired teacher) I was caught up in the political and human issues tackled by Theo and delighted with his methods for addressing them.

B004PGO25O|4.0|Very tight book, no excess words.  Are you ready to face your dragon?  That's a metaphor that describes &#34;doing your work&#34;.  My take away is that success and failure mean much less than finishing a project and shipping it to the world.  Even if the work fails, you have faced and killed the dragon inside yourself who said &#34;you can't do this&#34; &#34; everyone will hate this&#34; &#34;have another beer buddy and watch some tv&#34;....if you fought through all of that (and more) and released some work into the world...then win lose or draw, you have grown stronger, and you will know how to slay the dragon next time.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was just about right. Not too easy, not too hard. I will be waiting for the update. Enjoy!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game to be very fun and exciting. It really takes some thought to make it through.<br />I can't wait for more rooms.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love it, love, love, love Radio Active!! There is only one song the album that I don't care for, everything else is great!!
1878424319|5.0|Theresa Morgan<br /><br />Once you get into this book and the style of Don's writing you can walk away with some valuable life lessons and really begin to improve the way you think and your life becomes better !!! I have highly recommended this book to many and have given it as a gift.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game it's pretty awesome. My four kids, husband, and I all play it and have such a blast.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Can't go wrong watching this one. There is a reason why this one is considered one of the all-time best classics.  Great acting from Bogart and Bergman, along with excellent character actors.  The script creates an excellent blend of drama and some witty humor.  While in some cases, a great cast doesn't guarantee a good movie, this one does,  The plot and setting are excellent, and the acting makes it a classic.  Great movie.
B001AKTZPA|4.0|So I have always had the best of for CCR.  I figured to start getting the records and this one is pretty good.  the two addtional live songs are really good.  give you a perspective on how they were live.  the product arrived on time and in good condition.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I don't know why, but she loves it!  She likes the animals.  She likes the music.  She has liked it since birth and is 8 months old now and still loves to look at it.  In fact, it is part of her bedtime routine. I bought it used for $10, but after seeing how much she loves it, I think that it is actually worth $50.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A little too sexual but I must admit, I couldn't put it down. I read the first one, then couldn't wait to get started on the second book. I loved all the characters. It took me a bit longer to order the final book but I'm so glad I finally did. I won't give away the ending but must say how much I appreciate that there was closure for everyone. I thoroughly loved the ending. I will miss Christian and Ana.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I feel that the suggested applications are very doable and have changed my life.  I started out with the Secret and the Power.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is very very challenging game ever and that is why I like this game and tat is the only reason
B008JGSM6G|5.0|In 4th grade I was on my teachers phone and she showed me the game I was in love.  I have never played a better game I showed it to my mother and she was in love with it in seconds she would  not even let me have my kindle because she loved it so much it's not much of a game I mean all u do is connect some dots but I still think it's really fun that's why I give this game 5 stars :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|ppl on kindle fire have to goto app updates to update this app it dose not self update. so plz don't go like ima let this app update it's self.<br />just go to app update kindle fire users
B001I999C2|5.0|Drumline is a must for any kid thinking of becoming a band geek.  It stirs the spirit and makes you feel so good.<br />It is great for anyone who loves to hear precision drums.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. Can not wait to play some more levels. It gets harder as you go up but it's fun to figure out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome upgrade, about time. looking forward to more and perhaps accessories that can do things like a whip to swing from trees or other uses for coins.
B005CX53RU|5.0|This is the genuine article not an aftermarket battery. It performs perfectly as it is the exact same as the original. Very pleased!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Makes you think and more involved then just a simple puzzle game. Good story for a change and the graphics are well done.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Good movie...very intense.  I can understand why Naomi Watts received a nomination for this film.  The actor who plays her oldest son deserved one, too.
1457514508|4.0|My thoughts:<br />At under 200 pages this book could easily deceive the would be reader into thinking that it's a quick, mindless read, but this little book packs a BIG story.  This book is filled with mystery and misdirection rolled into what appears to be common, every day happenings in a small neighborhood called Gordonston.  There is so much going on within the pages that you really have to be on your toes not to miss the details.  Irony, steeped in nuance and subtlety, make up an interesting, original and fairly complicated storyline.<br />The characters are creative and well done.  The connections between and around the characters are brilliantly planned and strategically eluded to until the whole thing comes together in an expertly crafted, ingenious ending.<br />Well worth a read! Don't let the \\"skinny book\\" look fool you.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was a great movie that had some scary, creepy moments, but also had a solid plot. Some of the scenes remind me of the The Ring and The Grudge due to the creepy way the characters move. A very good movie with a good ending.Highly recommend it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|All I can say is WOW with this headset.  I bought this a replacement to some older surround sound headphones that I had that cost much more than these.  The wireless feature is wonderful, and the range is more than enough.  I tested out playing music and walked all around my house (2-Story) and had no issues at all, probably could mow the grass with these on!<br /><br />Packaging was great, and the software is easy to use.  There is plenty of cord length to plug into your tower and set on your desk, with plenty more to use the headphones while plugged in if your battery is running low.  The auto mute on the mic is great when the boom is lifted up, makes having side conversations easy without having to use push-to-talk.  There is also a mute button on the side along with volume control.  Have not decided what I am going to program to the 3 extra buttons, but they do control music player from the box.<br /><br />Sound quality is great, crisp and clear.  Bass control is very nice also.  Like having a full theater on your head.  I nice feature is that the ear cup part actually rotates, my old set did not do this and they ended up cracking due to the stress.  The fit is very comfortable and snug.<br /><br />Very satisfied and would recommend for anyone, not just for gaming.
B00CHRB9RM|4.0|The remastering on the original album is excellent, and the disc of jams/outtakes is fun. As for the live material, nowhere in the booklet does it mention that four of the tracks were already released on the 1976 double live album, \\"Wipe The Windows, Check The Oil, Dollar Gas.\\" Yes, that album is out of print, but still, those four tracks are already out there. It is great to have the rest of that concert.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is the best horse app ever! And is 100  percent  free. It's almost like a real horse and the horse never dies!
159463176X|2.0|Having read Khaled Hosseini's first two books I guess I expected more. \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is one of my favorite books I've ever read. The story is rich and the characters he creates are instantly engaging. I was sorely disappointed by his newest \\"And The Mountains Echoed\\" The story is fragmented and meandering, it jumps around from place to place and character to character. There are points that I see his brilliance in using words to create incredible images but I think it gets lost in characters that I couldn't care less about. He is a wonderful wordsmith but I think he lost his way with this book. If you haven't read is first two books do yourself a favor, skip this one and read either of them. They are incredibly better that this one.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|Actually my school requires me to read this book it was great. I love to read a book now. Even though i am foreigner i love how they apporach case.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My 7 yr old son and I love this game. It can be quite challenging at times but it is pretty darn amazing! I would give it two thumbs up but I am too busy trying not to get torpedoed by the submarines!
B00026ZG10|5.0|it seems like True Lies sort of got swept under the rug as far as 90s action movies goes.  It's not Arnold's most well-known movie (not even close) but it's one of his best, if not THE best Arnold movie.  Certain scenes are utterly hilarious (basically anything involving Bill Paxton's character, who is one of my favorite cinema characters of all time, not joking), and the action scenes are just incredible.  If you haven't seen it yet, buy it now.
B0061QD88S|5.0|This 1955 movie stands up to the test of time and is a lot of fun to watch.  The story of Lady and the Tramp is touching, raucous, exciting and energizing.  The characters are enjoyable and well developed, and you find yourself rooting for them as they make their way through the story.  It's a Disney flick, and everything turns out all right, but there are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep it exciting, and you can't be sure of the ending until you get there.  The evil Siamese cats are a hoot, and Lady's dog friends are loyal and stick with her to the end.  This movie depicts a world where motor cars are something new, around the turn of the 20th century, and yet it is as clear and comprehensible as a story set in the present day.  I haven't seen Lady and the Tramp 2, but it's on my list, and I'm hoping the Disney crew got it right.  The songs in this movie are entertaining and topical, and the sound quality is first rate.  The video quality is also very high; I was worried that it would be showing its age, but it doesn't.  This movie could have been made last year.  I think this flick is a winner for young children and is a good time for adults as well.  I bought this movie as a present for my goddaughter and will be giving it to her in a few months as a gift of classical animation to complement all her Studio Ghibli movies.  Kudos to Disney for preserving this classic movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|OMG! this show will have you begging for more. Its not scary at all, comfortable enough for the entire family to enjoy together. Every episode is so suspenseful and addicting. For those who aren't cable subscribers but are members of Netflix will only be disappointed to know that Netflix only offers Season 1 and 2. Amazon offers the 3rd Season for a reasonable price and the instant video is so simple you'll be able to view in just seconds! I highly recommend watching this show and if you're like me and you just cant wait until Netflix decides to offer Season 3, no worries just subscribe to Amazon :)
0345452585|5.0|This is now my third book by Jonathan Kellerman and it is my favorite.  It had a great plot that offered intrigue and suspense.  The two main characters were loveable and you couldn't help but cheer for them.<br /><br />Add to this the members of the conspiracy club, all of whom added another layer to the book.<br /><br />A quick read - perfect for a summer read on the beach.<br /><br />Diana Young #1 Amazon Best-selling author Financial Fitness for Beginners.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game has the prettiest makeup but what I don't like is that you have to pay for the dresses and the makeup and everything else
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this app so much it has me wondering what I have to do or find next. Y<br />ou should love this app too.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Love the dictionary so helpful! they need to have  a easier way to  look up words faster then i would use it more! :) and the word alexis amd dyllan need to be add
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I've been following, with much interest, James blog (www.jamesaltucher.com) for about two years now, and when he launch this book a couple of weeks back I immediately went and bought it on Amazon (also James smart marketing campaign had something to do with it).<br /><br />James writes in a very conversational way, which creates a very fluid reading experience. Also he presents his, sometimes very unconventional, ideas in a clear fashion. It truly is a pleasure to read his blog, and this book is no different.<br /><br />In Choose Yourself, James approaches in a very straight forward way several of the main issues that we face in today's world. Issues like employment, education, the fear of failure ... Occasionally he present what can easily be consider a more extreme views, that I personally don't agree at 100%. Yet James always shows real insight in to the issues, frequently illustrates then with his own personal experiences, and clearly shows that he is a man of his own mind, that he doesn't go with the crowd, and that he has truly spent time thinking about the issues and arriving at his own conclusions.<br /><br />It is an extremely interesting book, very easy to read, and that i sincerely recommend to everyone regardless of their background and of what they are presently doing with their lives.<br /><br />On just a small final note, i would add that the last quarter of the book, is a little bit more fragmented and sometimes one feels that he is really reading a blog. Not that there is anything wrong with that, it is just that some people might feel put off by this. Which they shouldn't has the content is still very interesting.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Just got this game its rated a 5 im ma go nd play sum more nd get to learnin more thx
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful, ambiguous, funny. A story about several levels of  suffering, and the saving graces of  spunk, kindness, love, metaphor and imagination. Pi's father lets him witness the cruelty of the way things are --- nature red in tooth and claw. Pi's mother teaches him the gorgeousness of 'it all&#34;  as embedded in the legends or stories of several of the the Hindu gods.  Pi is able to draw on these perspectives when stranded in a lifeboat at sea for many days.  As a student of Buddhism, I find some of the key concepts familiar..eg., to live involves suffering, I do not know enough about Hinduism to really make this comment, but Shiva's dance of  the wheel of  creation and destruction is 'in' this film.  The young actor makes Pi appealing, the adult actor is on target , and also I like it that he is not classically handsome. It is worth seeing a second time.  I have not read the book.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|My granddaughter loves the Disney movies.  I ordered this for her as a gift, she was happy and so was her mom.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book captivated me from beginning to end and I would recommend it to ANYONE! I love being able to read about the culture and history of Kabul through the eyes of natives.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|My granddaughter absolutely loves this movie, she just turned 4 and watches it everyday.. she says thank you mema for buying me hipahontas... thanks
B009YP9L7U|4.0|An ideal book for holiday reading.  Easy to get into, right from page one and I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00BN3EE1O|4.0|This movie kept me watching until the very end.  The ending was a big surprise.  It is worth a &#34;watch.&#34;
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I saw the film Pollyanna and hoped that the book Pollyana Grows Up would be worth a read, which it certainly was.  Easy to read and enjoyable.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|Six interweaving stories in which the predecessor inspires the next person to something higher with a seventh that entails the prologue and epilogue.<br /><br />I knew this was woven too well and had to be based on a novel or something similar and sure enough that was the case (a novel of the same title by David Mitchell). It even ran out of funding at one point but all the people were so enthusiastic they took cuts and pressed on from what the Wiki claims.<br /><br />I liked how actors and actresses played several roles (male and female of varying ages) and some of them I didn't recognize until the end credits rolled. The star-studded cast included: Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and a host of others.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving plays the pessimistic voice that \\"It will never work\\" just as Elrond to his daughter in LORD OF THE RINGS. I found that quite amusing.<br /><br />Tom Hanks plays a villain in one of the story angles which was a nice change and nothing I have ever seen him do as he's always the \\"good guy\\".<br /><br />Reincarnation themes and spirituality connecting humanity's souls are prevalent.<br /><br />I agree with film critic Roger Ebert that this was quite an ambitious film. It took me by surprise quite nicely. The Golden Globes nominated it for Best Original Score and the Academy Awards nominated it for Best Visual Effects.<br /><br />The budget was a bit over $100M and it cleared a bit over $130M at the Box Office. Casual viewers may have to struggle with the film before \\"getting it\\" and appreciating its nuances.<br /><br />SOUND/MUSIC: A minus to A; CINEMATOGRAPHY/CGI: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; SCI FI FOCUSES/THEMES: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of June 2013 (will be watching a second time before I return the DVD).

B000NSJ4Q0|5.0|I shoot Fashion Photography, and you never know when the lighting is going to be poor. The additional power and refresh rate allows me to shoot while my competition is changing batteries. Don't miss that perfect shot...
B000FC12ZA|5.0|An essential reading on the journey to enlightenment! This is a story about the roots of who we are and the core of our consciousness.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is really more of a psychological study of how a group of politically-motivated elders manipulate a generation of gifted children (including Ender) to become &#34;fodder&#34; in an intergalactic war.  It's not the traditional &#34;zoom and shoot&#34; scenario with spaceship battles and attacking aliens - altho that's always lurking in the background.  And at the end, you're not sure WHO the bad guys are.  It will be interesting to see how they translate it into a movie (Jul 2013).
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Simple and free. Can be frustrating but addictive. I am going to keep playing &amp; playing &amp; playing. Oh my Oh my ooh fuzz 20?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Like the characters, plot, bit of history of the aristocrats in England, and the workings and behavior of this type of family to support the local town. Very interesting!
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Reminds me of being at my grandparents house when I was a child.  They used to read it to my all of the time.  I'm so glad I downloaded it so I can read it to my children!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Works great, I like that you can mix and match to create just the right melody. and the price can't be beat!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I enjoyed this TV series immensly when it first ran.  My family was enjoying it once again when it was offered for streaming from Netflix.  Then it was offered as a special deal from Amazon at a big dicount so we snapped it up.  Anybody who likes good characters, well acted, well written dialogue in a drama should get this series.
006114665X|2.0|WELL RESEARECHED  BUT RESEARCH so complete that consideration of war starting doesn't take place until almost 500 pages into the book  jminster
B00CFQN12Q|2.0|I knew it would be the same thing but bought it anyway.  Why did I not wait till it was free on Netflix or in Amazon Prime?
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game!! Wish there were more levels. Levels get harder but the ideas carry over from one level to the next.
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|I don't even like Tom Cruise.  There are lot's of reasons not to like him.  The movie is good though and he was very funny in Rock of Ages.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|The graphics at the very beginning look like a ps1 game.  I did however, struggle on to see if this movie was worth it.  It is overall an alright movie, with decent acting and special effects.  Most of the events in the movie are extremely predictable. Although what wasn't predictable was the part when you thought it was going to end and it continued for another 45 minutes.  It really reminded me of THE DARK KNIGHT when it did that.<br />at any rate, this might be a good one for teenagers but its hard to really love this movie as an adult.<br />I recommend hansel and gretel and snow white and the huntsman
B00340LM8C|5.0|I am bias.  Grace Kelly amazing and always liked Grant in anything.  He is who George Clooney hopes to be when he grows up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've played a lot of games like this for example ( survival craft ) but none are close to being as fun as this one
B00BHMEOP2|1.0|Hollywood takes parts of what they want from history and tells a story that leaves out why the hostages were there so long.  If Carter was not so weak those hostages would never have needed help.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love the game fun and easy to play will get many hours of enjoyment from it.. keeps the mind sharp..
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Easy read with global prospective and interesting view points. Great book, don't bother with the movie, or at least read the book first.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I LOVED this app. It works great for downloading your favorite YouTube videos and watching them with no wifi. I . LOVE FREEdom YouTube Downloader!!!!!!!

082300659X|5.0|I make my students watch a section of the CD in my drawing class. They say it helped them very much, and relieves me of taking up a lot of class time with a demonstration. Juliette is a beautiful artist and she knows classical drawing inside and out. I would not hesitate to recommend this book highly...some will think it too technical, but my feeling is that if you want to learn, learn to do it right from the start. Drawing is not easy, and it takes a lot of practice and work. If you want to learn it, you have a great tool here.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Lots of conclusions here. Fun past time read and would recommend it for those who follow the Game of Thrones.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great I like how you can create your own character and I like how you name the friend I named it after friend I'm only on level three and it is awesome!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game on it  every day. Much better than temple run and a good pickup for a free app.
B004BDC9F6|5.0|What can I say, if you like Bryan Adams you just can't go wrong purchasing this.  I like that I could just download it to my kindle.
B0038P80CO|4.0|This movie surprised me. The sci-fi action/thriller genre is loaded with shallow movies packed with action and special effects but not much substance. While the acting varies (the leads are great, the extras not so much), this movie shocked, thrilled, and delighted with a twist I simply didn't see coming at the end.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This app is ok I mean its fun but you die to easy I can not pass level one you know what I hate this app uh
0756405890|5.0|This is a truly amazing fantasy novel. It's hard to describe it without you actually reading it. While it is fantasy, it takes a very different approach than other books. The story has all of the elements of intrigue and excitement but is told in a way that is comfortable and moving. The universe is vast but unlike many novels where the characters are all carbon copy cliches, this one paints a vivid picture that comes alive through the pages. It's been awhile since I have had a book, even one that I enjoyed, that I had trouble putting down. I devoured this book over the course of several days and could not wait to pick up the sequel which is equally great.
B003L8GPT8|5.0|Good musical record of my youth. The quality is excellent. Listening to music with pleasure. Deep Purple is one of my favorite rock bands.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|The characters were interesting, there were no boring parts, another good addition to the Avengers collection.  Looking forward to more.
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|I expected it to be better.  It received great reviews.  This is the first book I read by Sylvia Plath.  For me it was an ok read.
B0080Z5IB8|5.0|I read this book in high school and I found it to be a fantastic book, but a total chore to read.  The pages are large and have small print, that combined with all the sub-script (forgot the correct term) items at the bottom of the pages made it take forever to get through each page.<br /><br />That said, the story is great!  The book ends about half way through the book, and the rest of the book is extra material to give you more information on the characters.<br /><br />I have been waiting for years now for a kindle edition to be released, every now and then this book will show up on amazon but then it disappears.  I wish they would hurry up and make a kindle edition where I can make the text bigger read it quickly.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|After being reeled in with the obvious conflict, the book ends with major action.  For some reason, I didn't feel the excitement though.  It was as if too much was squeezed into the last page, like a high school student who just realized he reached the necessary word count and so quickly closes.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|I loved Contagion, so I was looking forward to this movie.  Tatum, and Jude law are both awesome.<br /><br />I found this movie to be just ok.  The whole middle bit of the movie was rather irritating to watch.  At the end I felt a little better about the movie, but overall I just feel kinda bleh about it.<br /><br />Check it out if you liked Contagion and a good drama, but don't expect much.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I liked the book. I enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns much more. The problem I had with this book was that it jumped around a bit too much for my liking. I lost track of certain people and it was a bit confusing. I want to think it was my fault because I had gaps of time when I did not read it. I still believe this was a very rich book and very deep. I may need to start taking notes to keep track of the story better.

B00B29J0I6|3.0|Cute game, amusing concept, but not as engaging as I'd hoped when I heard &#34;physics based game&#34;.  Worth checking out, and my 4 yr old son enjoys it.
B000V63CI0|4.0|Fantastic album really, I remember Chris Evans on Virgin raving about it. Such a shame I already had most of the songs on Steinmans solo album produced after Meatloaf allegedly spat the dummy when recording what was to be BOOH2 way back.<br />Taking nothing from Steinman's production, it is so good and so recognisable you can forgive him when he uses the chorus line from 'Stark Raving Love' in Bonnie Tylers 'Holding Out For A Hero'.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|No foreign govt.  could be this dumb.  If I were from North or South Korea I would<br />be insulted.  They are like cartoon characters.  I have no respect for the people<br />who voted this book a prize winner.  The story was so confusing you could not tell who<br />is who or make sense of it.  I hated it.  I forced myself to finish it.
B0000046MM|1.0|This is a great CD if you like instrumental guitar music.  Paco De Lucia is so wicked talented and I love listening to his music.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|This is one of those CDs that you can listen to over and over and never get tired of it.  It's ZBB at their best, both lyrically and musically, and has a great mix of musical styles.  From upbeat and fun songs like Knee Deep or Make This Day, to the hauntingly beautiful Colder Weather, this CD has it all.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|If you liked The Help you will love the<br />Kitchen House. It is engaging from the very first page. I couldn't put the book down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each episode is better than the last!  It is hard to watch just one.  Just when you think you know what's going to happen, the ending credits pop up and you're left waiting for the next episode.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Not terribly engaging. Technically improbable. Good character development. Yet another story without an ending, made for serialization. But, not a complete waste of time.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I would read this again. I loved it very much and wish I could find more books that are like this one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read straight through Wool, then right through Shift, and I've already pre-ordered &#34;Dust&#34;. I can't wait for more...<br /><br />Just. Read. It.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It nail the way things were back then. we need more true history like this book. Not the North and the South but excellent.
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|i love this movie because it shows that the indivdual can and will win against<br />the collective and is very relevant to todays society where the government thinks<br />it knows best and the individual is a tool of the govern. amd that what is true is<br />that the constitution of the united states of america's basic principle is indiviualism<br />not collectiivism,and that principle is man's inalienable right which means it can not<br />be taken away from him.<br />  steve levycky
B00B19DW0E|5.0|this movie is glorious and unabashed; it simply embraces the best of the 80's action genre.  it is A # 1!
B00BVYKWJI|3.0|Entertaining but not a must see. Jeremy Irons is the whole show but not his best work.  Seems very cartoonish
B005HED08I|4.0|Great sound and clean video<br />Watched via internet and enjoyed being able to pause and pick up where I left off
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading all three of the books It's a good read and I can't wait to see the movies.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Thought it was good little surprises here there but too violent for little kids. 12 & older it is fine
B001E45XT4|3.0|Had them for about nine months, the output of the right ear is now significantly lower. Plantronics replaced them with the [[ASIN:B00B1KJWE8 Plantronics GameCom 380.]]<br /><br />Pros: Good quality. Feel pretty reliable. Retractable mic. Look like they block out all sounds so if you have a bothersome roommate, it should be a great deterrent.<br /><br />Cons: Not the best for eyeglass wearers. Ears will become stuffy and you'll start to sweat after about an hour. The ear pads like to collect dust. Great if you are going for the air traffic controller look.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|A different way a lot of action giants very scary loved the way it began made Jack older which gave a little romance.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Hands Free at last!  Automatically switches on and turns the blue tooth on my cell phone on as I enter my car and turns off as I leave it. For once a bluetooth that unburdens me and doesn't have the phone call go to the car when I am 10 feet away from it.  two small things I don't care for:  It talks some messages about battery condition and autodialing that are not loud and clear enough to understand, and second it seems to randomly dial phone numbers when I first power it up.  I do not use the voice command feature, as I do not call out when driving, but I do take a great many calls in very efficiently.
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS HERE!!!!MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION. Great for kindle fire. LOVE THE NEW SURVIVAL MODE. THERE ARE EVEN MOBS. GET IT. ME AND MY SISTER LOVE IT.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved how the character seemed like he was talking directly to the reader. Yes, he was arrogant, but I think it worked for the subject. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i really like games that are quick and it's very fun because you get into the game alot i didn't want to stop playing the game!:)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know its a little bit of money but its great I love it it just got a new update great its got animals now GREAT app I reccomend it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|If you like Temple Run, you will love Subway Surfers! I was rather surprised when I realized that these two games are so much alike. I did really enjoy this game, though. Great for kindle fire. No glitches. Very fun!!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|Very informative with lots of bits of info I had never read or heard before & I'm fairly well read on the subject.
B001BKTEZA|1.0|I think he is a boring writer. He spends too much tine on describing inconsequential details. Steinbeck spends a lot of time on his pet issues which do not further the plot. The book ended abruptly and left many aspects of the story unresolved.
B00BWJ6JO4|3.0|Unnessesarily long fight scenes, shallow character development and flat storytelling kinda killed this prequel. Let's hope the next one finishes with more bite.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|A new way of presenting zombies. Not through a conventional story tell, but through interviews. Makes it a frenetic, breath taking book. Really good analysis of a world destroyed by an unstoppable disease. I red, before WWZ, Max Brook's Zombie Survival Guide and I simply love the way he is able to bring you into the story. The main character of the story becomes you. Really entertaining and well written. I suggest both books.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|Then book was good and the story flowed well but I felt it lacked depth. Something is missing that keeps the book from springing to life like a Sanderson novel.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is my first rate ever &amp; for a reason! This game is just too freaken awesome! I just have to let people know that this game is a must! Download it for shark chomping fun lol!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book had me spellbound.  I couldn't put it down!! Healthcare has come a long way since Henrietta's time, thanks to her!
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|This soundtrack is the perfect companion to the game Last of Us. I was so taken by the mix of acting, game play and this lovely soundtrack. The music ties everything together and is poignant and relevant. Beautiful.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Oz The Great and Powerful is written in a very over the top way where the characters outright declare major plot points and motivations.  The dialog floats somewhere between being incredibly earnest and a parody of fairytale storytelling.  But aside from Rachel Weis, who is kind of decent, the actors lack the gusto to sell such precious presentation.  Mila Kunis in particular sounds out of place with her husky voiced faux New Yorker affect.  Here she's expected to portray a quintessentially naive girl turning into the epically evil Wicked Witch, and as you might expect she fails at both.  Aside from those human performances, the film has several highly annoying CGI characters who look and sound like the rejects from some straight to video Shrek sequel.  In general this is a very messy production.  There's no clear tone to it, the comedy is awful, and there's not even much of a story arc.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Over produced , plot too drawn out, over acted, wonderful cast, good props I could only watch it once but good action!
B0019O6IWU|5.0|While I disagree with the explanatory framework Rosenberg brings, the practicality of what he recommends is powerful indeed.<br /><br />Many of the ideas are ancient, like the Buddhist notion of non-judgemental awareness, and he gives good practical examples of how to bring this mode of being into reality in everyday life.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read
0345525558|4.0|There were a few wacky parts in this book, but all in allI love the story. Lots of redemption for all the characters and a very sad look at our child services in this country,
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I love this movie. It is a great movie about witches and humans falling in love. I hope they come out with another movie from the series of books.
B00CIHXUG4|5.0|5 stars for the album but....I assumed that the big square picture was the cover of the album jacket. nope. This is a picture disc only with a plastic clear sleeve. no cardboard album jacket. Maybe it's just me but that's half the fun of having purchased an \\"album\\"...was so you could admire the cardboard jacket while the actual album spins on the turntable. not in this case. I got the CD also. Thankfully, the CD came with a nice traditional booklet, it wasn't just the CD inside a clear jewel case (which would have been the CD equivalent of what I got with the album).
B002G01EPC|4.0|Like all figurarts figures it is incredibly detailed and extremely posable.<br />Only complaint is I have found the crossed arms addition can be slightly difficult to get to sit just right with the cape.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Way to go lads, another brilliant album! On the first listen through my favorite songs are &#34;As Loke Falls&#34; - top song, &#34;Shape Shifter&#34; - energetic Loke beard magic, &#34;Under Siege&#34; - epic song with a Ted solo!;), &#34;We Shall Destroy&#34; - gets me ready for the attack. I can see some of the other songs growing on me the more that I listen and appreciate them. However, the song &#34;Hel&#34; was a bit different and weird, still good, but not the usual AA style. Anyway, I'll be seeing them in July \m/  &#60;in a Johan growl&#62; Yeeeaaahhhh!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I don't usually rate games, since the snob in me really doesn't approve of such petty time-wasters, but this little app is perfect for waiting rooms and DMV lines.
B000XO2R22|4.0|I liked Sea Change very much. I know it was a post-break up album, but it showed a softer side of Beck. Great for Sunday mornings when you just need to chill out.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a great story! I'm very glad I read it! It makes you appreciate all your relationships in life!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fascinating characters. Not an 'action' book I would say. But somehow builds quickly and quietly till you're feeling trapped in the silo yourself...
B001CDWFPC|1.0|I was so excited to buy this study bible for my Kindle, especially at the price of $4.99! One slight problem though, it didn't work. It froze within the first couple navigations every time I ran it. I tried it many times, really hoping it would work, but had to return it. If they get rid of the glitches I would re-purchase.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is great, and really reliable. It always works and never shuts down like the web always did. I love this app on my Kindle Fire!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Although I really enjoyed Ford's earlier novels, &#34;Canada&#34; does not reach the heights of his previous ones.  Each sentence is carefully crafted, however, a feature I like because of its conversational manner. Still, I had to read it twice in two weeks, because I couldn't remember the characters or plot after the first reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Perfect for long car rides my 5 year old daughter loves it and thinks its funny when the character gets smashed or falls
0393343405|5.0|Part detective story and part inspirational, &#34;Swerve&#34; is  a wonderful book to read, right before you read Ramez Naam's &#34;The Infinite Resource: The Power of Ideas on a Finite Planet.&#34;  Taking the long view, Greenblatt goes 'way back in time to detail the discoveries of Lucretius (in particular his discovery of the atom) and his philosophy. Our lives today are threaded through by the thoughts of this great man whose ideas lay dormant for so long.  A must-read for all thinking people!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first gaming mouse I've ever used, and while I am not aware of what much more expensive rivals can offer, I can't imagine what more they could.  This baby has 9 buttons, an ADJUSTABLE lighted logo (as in, you can change it to any color you want - so freaking cool!) and the optional weighting system that makes it feel solid.  Certainly worth $39.99, and with Anker's incredibly helpful support team, you have almost no risk in buying it and seeing for yourself.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It has worked very nicley for me for the few days I used it. :) FINALLY! most of em just bring u to the website.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I got the pre-order a week or so ago and I have to say thank you! This is the sound and style that made me a fan from the beginning and this is the best music from Queensryche in ages.  Vocals are killer too!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Drew Barrymore did an outstanding job as always. I felt the movie kept my interest and told the story of how the media and a community came together to help save a family of whales.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I love Duels and raced home so I could play. Sadly it is broken and will not install.<br />Kindle HD
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche has done the impossible. Successfully fire one of the greatest and most iconic singers in all of metal and release an album that makes you forget that he even exists. But this isn't about Tate, this is about Queensryche and they have done an absolute stellar job of proving who rightfully deserves the Queensryche name.<br /><br />Nearly every song on the album is memorable and well-written and is a must-buy for anyone who is a fan of Queensryche. Every member's performance is top-notch and my only complaint is that the album is too short.<br /><br />5/5
B00CL68NOG|3.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was quite fun to see Barbara Streisand in a new comedy. It reminded me of the great comedies she was in in the 70's. Seth Rogan was wonderful, as always. I gave the movie only 3 stars because I thought the writing could have been a bit better.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show. Really enjoy the characters! My son told me about it and he was right. Looking forward to watching the next season.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I saw Emelie on Jay Leno and thought, I had to have her CD! I am so glad I did. She has a wonderful voice, and I enjoy every single song on it. I am so happy I bought this, it's been a great addition to the concert hall (aka automobile!).
B004XISI4A|5.0|I want to get to the end *now*, and I never want to get to the end of this book! And I hope this book series never ends. The TV series are good, but as always, the books are far better.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This series is great. I was already a Sherlock Holmes fan before checking this series out, and I have been thrilled with these updated versions of the stories. If you did not know, these &#34;episodes&#34; are really 90-minute movies, not hour or so long shows. It really gives the writers a lot of time to work with, all to the better. I think &#34;A Scandal in Belgravia&#34; is my favorite. It is a treat to watch, wonderfully acted, so darn funny! This series is a clever, imaginative homage to Sir AC Doyle's originals, and I can't wait for season 3!
B00785P2QC|5.0|really fun game you should get it. forsure. makes time fly fast. g5 makes some really fun games. one of my favorite game company
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|awesome game it is so awesome to get insane air and do about four flips! On the moon you get insane air time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how you can get a feel of having your own horse totally love it. and I know you will too.
B0042KA5EK|2.0|I was looking for something to watch while I did some boring work.  This did not work out.  Acting was rather boring.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This site is very user friendly and has complete weather information.  I would highly recommend this download to everyone with a Kindle.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoy this game. She is a horse lover and its fun taking care of horses together. :)
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome I play it all the time. After playing the first one I knew this had to be good. Actual WW2 firearms AWESOME!!
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|Not up to the usual performance. Predictable outcome usual action shootouts bad guys die hero wins.Carried the series of Die Hard one too many.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|The sound quality is amazing and I would highly recommend this album as opposed to the CD or MP3 of the same.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It was a Book Club selection.  All members agreed that it was light reading, with some members more critical of the content, calling it &#34;Contrite,&#34;  I thought it was a different perspective (the dog's) of difficult family/personal issues.  Also, learned more about professional car racing.
0689878451|5.0|This sweet and true tale gives emphasis on the love between the penguins and the love for their child, not on the gender of their love or any other labels bar a loving family.  Brilliant book that normalizes that every family is different and equal.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I like this movie alot. I wonder if they are going to make a part 2. I'm sure there could be a great part 2.
0767802624|5.0|MIB has always been a favorite movie of mine and it needs 11 more words to prove it to me.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Amon Amarth has once again delivered a powerhouse of an album!  My wife and I had been waiting a loooong time for this to come out.  We are just fascinated with the way Amon Amarth brings to life the Viking Lore.  The title track is awesome, with a fast galloping beat and strong death growls.  I can almost feel the hooves of my horse beneath me as I ride into Battle.  Tracks 9 and 10 are amazing Metal Slabs of Power and Strength.  If you listen to any type of metal music this should be required hearing.  Now come... put on your chainmail, unsheathe your sword, get on your horse and ride into the fray!  Incredible.  Just incredible!  Can't wait to see them in concert.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Best show ever. Season 6 was not the best of Dexter but Season 7 totally made up for it! Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Very strange pricing...<br /><br />Audio CD from Amazon comes with AutoRip, which instantly give you all 13 tracks in Amazon Cloud Player, and is cheaper than buying MP3 album.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Love it! I recommend purchasing the entire set. Once you watch the first movie you become addicted! All the characters are awesome!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Leave it to the Brits to make us wanna go back in time - historical track is interesting and characters are fun - plots are great - gotta watch from the beginning though
0470449764|2.0|Was hoping for additional problems etc, but its the same material as The Official Guide for GMAT Review. No need to buy both
B003TSEL7S|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read<br />I like the series and the books Rick duodenum writes now
0470449756|2.0|I was hoping for additional practice aside from the Official Guide for GMAT Review, but this just copies the same material from the Verbal section of the Official Guide for GMAT Review
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This is a great thinking and puzzle solving game. It reminds me of the 100 floors game but I like this game better. My only problem with it is that I wish there were more levels.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|While the plot line is really unbelievable, the story is compelling as Walt transforms.<br /><br />A good lesson in the dichotomy of the human experience.
125000098X|5.0|I've always enjoyed all of Archer's novels and this is no exception.  Awaiting the next installment.  Pick up the first in the series and GET STARTED!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Love the series.  Great acting and imaginative storylines.<br /><br />I will anxiously await how the story plays out in the final season.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I picked this up day one at Best Buy for the added bonus track.  I played this entire 12 songs probably 7-8x all day long.  It gets better and better each time.  Ozzy's vocals are well performed, he sounds younger, fresher, and lively, compared to his past couple of solo records (Scream, Black Rain, Down to Earth).  Iommi hasn't lost a beat, keeping his chops fresh with Heaven and Hell and his Iommi projects in between reunion tours.  Geezer is holding the bottom end up well, and lyrically came up with some awesome songs and subjects.  Sonically I like the album, I play it loud, and it's just a rip fest musically.  Kinda goes back to their roots, but maybe just the first album where they had yet established that groundbreaking sound.  But it's 21st century Sabbath to my ears, fresh, new, progressive, and just glad it was made!  Long live Sabbath, hopefully their is more in the canon for another album, but if this is it, it's one heck of an ending...cheers
B008CLI4N4|5.0|An interesting fantasy series.  The acting is solid and the general plotline is fun to watch unfold.<br /><br />Middle earth....where are the hobbits?
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Didn't see it in theaters but decided to rent it to watch on the plane. Action, suspense, and Tom Cruise - overall I really liked this movie and will most likely buy it!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|While the plot line is really unbelievable, the story is compelling as Walt transforms.<br /><br />A good lesson in the dichotomy of the human experience.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked how this book went into different characters point if views I would of liked to see some more characters point of views in it. Maybe Julian's or Auggie's Mom or Dad's. But overall very good i loved it!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|While the plot line is really unbelievable, the story is compelling as Walt transforms.<br /><br />A good lesson in the dichotomy of the human experience.
1905113153|5.0|I have had this book for some time now, but I didn't have the time to devote to practice: but now  I'm doing it and I really love learning all the techniques.
B005FQ2H8W|4.0|I love the story.  The presentation could have been much better, but for the time it was decent.<br /><br />I would love to see a remake with todays FX capabilities.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Chicken foot is a must have for any guitar blues fan!! It has incredible guitar solos and vocals by Hagar...I'll Definatly buy more.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|After visiting Lana'i this winter, we wanted some music that reflected the old Hawaiian experience we enjoyed.  This CD continues to satisfy and brings back wonderful memories of our trip.  We loved the movie, too, and it's fun calling up those key moments in the film enhanced by the music.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This has got to be one of the most addictive games available. I can't seem to put it down.  Lots of choices for character, upgrades in armor, potions, and excellent graphics. Works great on my Kindle Fire, but I wish I had a physical control for movement...
B0088ETCHW|5.0|A very comprehensive book that meets the expectations. I have read several books on this subject and believe me this is the one!
B00B29J0I6|4.0|I thought it was adorable. I really don't play games on devices much because I'm middle-aged and I find them complicated and frustrating; I know there are middle-aged folks out there who love to game, but I still like the old-school games, like Tetris. This was like a combination of Tetris and Angry Birds, so it was only challenging enough to keep me interested while not being so complicated that I'd give up. THAT'S exactly what I was looking for. My 9 year old quickly zoomed through all the levels, but he still loved it. My 14 and 16 year olds didn't care for it. Cute and simple.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|One of the few films that you will watch that will really make you think about your own life.  Rent this movie.
B00634GHJA|4.0|a quick app using wifi to get photos or to send them, the only drawback is haing to enter that code EVERYtime you do go to say a desk top , if that step could be omited, I would rate it a 10 star, love it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can I say!  What a great way to wrap up a wonderful love story.  I am so glad I read these series.
B007JNWJMI|5.0|Love this app, so easy to use and the effects arre really cool, love the ease and simplicity to achieve the results, it is fun to use and able to transfer the edited photo to my desktop or email it,  the pictures also print out nice, once on my desktop I save them as a bmp file ,
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not wait to start book two.  Did not disappoint.  Could not put it down.  I will be sad when I am done with book 3
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Best investment i ever made! If you are a West Wing fan, pick up this collection. You will not be sorry!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What a great book.  Tore through it in a day!  Can't wait to start book two.  Must read! Keep it up James!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Didn't know what to expect. Thanks for the wild ride! I felt as though I was right there with the dad on his emotional carnival ride. This book kept me guessing and surprised.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Wow! I did not expect to fall in love with this story, but I did. Sparks captivated my curiosity about Katie. Her past was so dark from her abusive husband and she manages to get away. Fleeing to small town she finds a family that helps her heal and saves her life. She is a woman I find myself cheering for. Please read this book for it is truly a story of strength.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|My kids downloaded this.  It is being removed from my kindle.  Audible neck snaps make my stomach turn.  Shame on the creator.
B008602KQI|4.0|Solid start to the series. It's not a fantastic movie on its own but it lays a solid foundation for the series.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|Big fan of his and love this movie.  Plan on buying it one of these days.  Happy with my purchase, thank you.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I had to read this book for my school summer reading. I thought it would've been very boring, but this was the most exciting book I have ever read. You never know what will happen next. At the end, you don't know what Vera is going to do. The whole book is so surprising, but so exciting. In would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Not only did this DVD show up on time and in great condition, I really loved this movie.  I will be ordering from them again, and any DEpp fan would love this.  :^)
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Great little app for jotting down notes or keeping track of little things and reminders.  Functions pretty easily and is easy to use.
B004X75RK4|4.0|Love this movie, love Ryan, and I adore Sandra.  It's a cute movie.  I am happy with my purchase, will buy it on DVD eventually.  I like my Amazon Prime account.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Angry Birds with a twist.  The addition of &#34;Space&#34; makes for other challenges.  Cute app if you are looking to waste some time.
B0095EMOTM|1.0|It was like I was playing my initial cd. I wasted my money on this one. :( Have lost the faith on David's music.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Just what it seems.  Lots of running and jumping and sliding.  Can be challenging.  Hard to hold and control sometimes, but it's just the learning curve.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|great kindle fire app, i just have to get off my butt and use it.  My daughter loves it and tries the  workout but it get harder after a while so she gives up too easily.  It totally serves it's purpose.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|I enjoyed this funny, imaginative story.  Just the kind of light reading to follow a heavy read.  I will watch for more of the same.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|In a previous review of the Beatles Mono box set, I stated a preference for mono over stereo, as this is how the Beatles intended their music to be heard, up to, but not necessarily including, \\"The White Album\\". For months I have been debating on purchasing the Apple USB. I finally broke down and bought one, in used, like new, condition here on Amazon. It arrived today, and I have been playing select tracks using the FLAC files. After obtaining the necessary software to be able to play the FLAC files, I discovered a noticeable difference between the regular Stereo Box Set and the FLAC files, just a little bit sharper, brighter, and clearer. I only wish there were mono FLAC files for at least the first 4 albums and most of the first part of \\"Past Masters\\". But, with this sound quality, I can tolerate the flaws on the stereo masters. If you are a True Beatles Follower, as I am, and have just about everything, go get one of these approximately 30,000 little jewels that are on the planet and disappearing fast, and going up in price with each passing month, even for used ones, GET ONE SOON! I was skeptical about plunking down a little over $220.00 for a used one. But I'm happy I did. It's AWESOME!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|it sounds like a good game to play on the kindle.so I will play this game and see for myself how good this game is.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire has always been one of my favorite classic games. I would like to see the other versions of it also offered on the kindle though.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great series! Kirk and Spock will always trump any other series of Star Trek! The blu ray version brings out all the great effects of these old films!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Finally the album that QR fans have been waiting for since Promised Land.  Awesome effort guys!! I cannot wait for the next release.  Standout tracks: Spore, In this Light, Redemption, A World Without, Dont Look Back, Open Road
0307970299|5.0|This book is fabulous.  Strayed is an outstanding writer, and you can visualize every step.  Love all the characters she meets on the road.  Love the steps back into time as she reflects on her errant ways.  Highly recommend this book! Its also very motivational to me, to live boldly, and set goals that stretch you.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Was one of the best books I've ever read! I'd recommend it to anybody who loves a nice and relaxing read.
B007L24T52|5.0|All the Baldacci books make good reading and the man character is equal to the action. Can't wait until the next one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is awesome and very challenging .It is very entertaining and I love .Sure its confusing but that's what the game is going for so it's doing its job.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I will always give Gideon Cross 5 stars.  I loved this book and feel people are not giving it a chance.  I love the chemistry between Eva and Gideon.  They would both do anything for each other.  I've seen reviews where people have indicated that there was BDSM in this book.  He restrained her once which is hardly BDSM.  Actually I thought it was hot.  I just don't understand what people think.  So she's making a 4th book, who cares...you don't rate a book based on that.  She leaves you hanging at the end.  Well hello, thats what a cliffhanger is when theres another book in the making.  People need to relax and enjoy
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have had this game for awhile. I have it on my kindle and I have a connection to Facebook. It's a great game to play along with your friends.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a very good game,it has amazing graphics and music and plus you get to talk yo your team mates.I reconmend this game to any fanatsy/stratagey lover
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This was my favorite movie of 2012.  The quality of the effects is excellent and the theme is wonderful.  The movie was so interesting that I researched the story and found that the theme is predation.  To me it meant something different.  Every bad action, causes another bad action, and every good action also cascades.  The movie was inspiring that good and evil will cycles together on and on.  Interesting story, very good acting, directions and dialogue.
B004PIKPTY|1.0|Bought this unit, but not even 2 months later the control box started giving problems and the one speaker started to malfunction and cut out at random intervals. Termaltake should really take this off the market. One of the worst products if ever had. One star is an overrating for this product. Should get 0 stars.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I bought the first three seasons of this show as they came out, and was terribly disappointed by the fact that they were 2-sided DVDs. It's almost impossible to keep those clean and in good condition, and no matter how much I paid attention I was always getting the wrong side when I tried to watch episodes.<br /><br />The complete series set has single-side DVDs, which as far as I'm concerned makes up for the fact that I already owned almost half of the series all on its own. Add to that the beautiful packaging and the pilot script book and episode guide book that goes along with it, and it's definitely a truly COMPLETE series set. My only complaint is that the glue on the front of the series box dried up and the bottom part flops open, but when it's closed with the magnetic seal it's not an issue. I'll probably reglue it myself at some point.
B003ELY7PG|4.0|Tim Ferriss started it with the Four Hour Work Week. Jason Fried emphasises and adds to the concept that there's business, and then there's smart business.<br /><br />Rework is a fantastic tool for anyone operating their own business to explore how to do things better, more efficiently, and ultimately achieve better results for your clients/customers, and more time doing what you love. (Because isn't that why you got into business in the first place?)<br /><br />A very easy read with a conversational tone and pointing to some great resources, this book is a great read for anyone just getting started in business... or who needs a bit of a kick-along to do business a little better.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I think they sort of took the easy way out towards the end, but at least is was a fun easy.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Best news source ever!  Multiple news articles about almost any interest from technology to food or music and many more.  Direct access to Facebook and Twitter. All in one place.<br />THIS A MUST HAVE APP !!!
B004I744AS|5.0|I have tried several dictionaries...this one is by far the easiest to use.  I love all the trivia on the main page...the definition challenges...the horoscope...I could go on and on...try it!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I liked most of the story lines.  Over all a good season.  Don't care for the Q stories at all.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|It's a shame this show was cancelled after only one season. It has adventure, humor, space... What more could you ask for??
B008220C56|5.0|With all the negative reviews out there, I felt obligated to post a review since I completely disagree.  First, I have read the book.  I have also watched other movie versions including the one with Vivian Leigh and the one with Greta Garbo.  If you watch the movie expecting and wanting it to be how it played out in your head while you were reading it, I could see how you might be frustrated or disappointed.  To put it simply, this version is artsy.  What it says with visuals is as important to the story as the dialogue.  I felt like I was being whirled through the movie (as compared to the slower pace of reading the book) but it still felt detailed and complete.  I actually liked it better the second time I watched it because I was less focused on the dialogue and more on the visuals.  And I'm not just talking about the set and the way it was filmed as if it were on a stage.  I'm talking about the mannerisms, the verbal nuances and the body language that communicated what a movie version of the book doesn't have time to say.<br /><br />If you love Kiera Knightley, Pride and Predjudice, Shakespeare in Love, Atonement, The Age of Innocence, House of Mirth, Jude the Obscure .... oh, the list goes on and one, then give this movie a try.  It also helps if you've read the book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It does not matter if you are a believer in God or not. This is not a religious book. It does not talk about bible or church. More than that...
B009CWWFD2|4.0|Mr. Archer has a wonderful, exciting way of developing his characters.  This book is no exception.<br /><br />The ending was not quite as good as many of his other books but the way he weaves his story lines makes you not want to put the book down.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a wonderful addition to my Kindle.  When a summer  storm or winter snowfall is in the forecast I am relieved to see the radar and forcast to know how close it is to our home.  Also,  Thanks for the update.  Wanda G.
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|If your a fan of Stone Sour or Corey Taylor its a great album.  Lyrically the songs have deeper meanings, so well worth listening to a few times.
0061120073|5.0|Great condition, no marks, rips or tears. Bought this for my 13 yr old daughter its a classic that everyone should read. Love love love!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its really fun you can feed and groom your horse and you can compete in different competitions but you'll need some training first. :)<br />You can also have friends and request friends and meet people that you wanna meet and its really fun.
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Good warm hearted and fun read slow to start but we'll worth the effort a real enjoyable read one worth repeating
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic read, I enjoyed every page and thank these brave men & women for their service to our country and others
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The title says it all. Books 1&2 are better. I felt the pace was too slow for the first half. Maybe it's because there was such a long wait for this book to be released or maybe the author is dragging her series out to make more money. Either way this read is ok. Not horrible but not the best. I will still buy the next book in the series, but seriously. She doesn't need to write anymore than one book to wrap this series up. If the writing and story line isn't better paced in book 4, it will be hard to persuade me to buy any other books in this series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this app very entertaining!  It keeps me busy trying to figure out the  puzzles!  Lots of fun!  I love playing it!
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game it's awesome Heidi buried using hd$dogalso Couric civic click stick Clifford suffix xoxox during check copies xoxox studies
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age offer an old fashioned bluesy Zepplinesque beat with the newer rock sounds of today. I'm an old rocker that really enjoys seeing and listenoing to the younger crowd of great hard rock musicians.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|About one of every three darts goes where you want it.  The rest fade off to the right or left.  Jamming is a problem.  Jams will scuff or tear your darts.  The condition of your darts will deteriorate quickly using the clips anyhow.  Don't buy any nerf dart gun with a clip system. Its nothing but trouble.  The only redeeming quality of this gun is the quick reloads.  Of course, this means sinking more money to buy clips, expanding your already poor purchase.  You can just fire so many darts, you might get lucky and score a hit.  Get a smaller dart gun, like the Maverick.
B000GJPL1S|5.0|After all these years it's still a great movie to watch. The amazon streaming worked perfectly. I didn't have any problems viewing the movie.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This game was uber fun, but I beat it in a day. I wish there were more levels. I have a kildle fire and it was hard to move the guy.
B00843TZJ2|5.0|Saw them on this tour, and was (and still am) amazed at the resurgence of Stills. He has learned how to deal with the decline in his voice, and Crosby and Nash seemed at peace with adjusting their harmonies a little to compensate. As good a concert as when they were in their prime. I can't seem to get the CD's out of my player.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I like these kind of games so I thought it was fun enough. It was working smoothly at first but now that I have finished the game and am going back through to build my castle it is freezing up bad.
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|It's been a long time since I last played FreeCell. Really enjoyed this app'. No particular bells and whistles, just an honest, clean game. A good game to keep the mind active and alert
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is so much fun i can not stop playing this game you should get rhis game. i love it
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I'm a senior not quite ready for retirement, in good health, and looking to remain in prime health a few years or so longer. This app' offers me some easy exercises, and a simple routine in which to optimize the benefits. Never too old to get on the exercise bandwagon. Looking forward to continued good health.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was a enjoyable read and great introduction to an interesting new world.  I was able to finish this easily on a 10 hour roadtrip.  I already downloaded the second book to my Kindle and am planning on starting it tonight.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot. It has all the things you love about studio ghibli and more. The animation is beautiful. The story is heartwarming and the characters are loveable.<br />I will say that the entire shebang is a little more fantastical than other ghibli films, but that only adds to the immersive universe that studio ghibli has created.<br />BUY THIS NOW.
B006GLM5EQ|2.0|This was not at all what I was expecting.  I don't think I lasted much more than 15 minutes.  I felt that the acting was stilted.  The plot seemed to be focused on the most sexual aspects of the books and very little on the story line.  Anna Paquin was not a good choice for the main character.  Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone who was a big fan of the books or anyone else for that matter.  I was so very disappointed
B003MC5N28|5.0|I read this book book before and I read it again and it doesn't amaze me how wonderful this book is
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the sight.  My son told me to be prepared to be addicted and I am.It is better than watching TV. I think I will cancel some magazine subscriptions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a high paced action game. You really don't have to use real life money, because you can get so many coins. Awsome just awsome.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I think this was a well made and fitting pre-quel to the original Wizard of Oz, though I also felt compelled to now go find a copy of &#34;Wicked&#34; and see how that lines up with both movies and the rest of Baum's Oz universe.<br /><br />Oz the Great and Powerful, is amusing and witty, but seemingly aimed at a more juvenile audience but was none the less enjoyable to watch. I did think it was a bit heavy on CGI for the back grounds/ scenery, though beautifully done.<br /><br />I had no issues with streaming the video using a Sony set top media center, we paused to make popcorn in the middle and had no issues resuming the movie. Though I will say trying to rent a movie from my Android tablet is a bit frustrating, if I purchase the rental from the STB, it works smoothly
030758836X|1.0|Passed the book on to a young woman I know who reads A LOT and MIGHT like it, told her to throw it away if she can't make it past the first few chapters. I only read because it was a book club book, only one gal in the club liked it.  Most of us didn't even finish it.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Just please go ahead and Die hard already.  I hope this movie is a 'hand off&#34; and Jr will be taking over the story line with the occasional cameo by Sr, thus opening the series to broader competition with James Bond, Bourne and the like.<br /><br />Over all the car stunts, while visually exciting, are just too over the top and break the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />A Good Day to Die Hard did a good job of blending a bonding movie with action, but it was 90+/- minutes of &#34;Uh uh&#34;
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a fantastic length for a cord and it is not thin. It has some weight to the cord so you know it will last. You definitely will want more once you try the first one.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|You would never think that Dexter Morgan could get out of this one...but yet, this is JUST Season 2!! Watch out for the NA Sponsor, Lila, she is a fun one. (The sex scenes are WAY HOT.) And Sgt. Doakes is so suspicious of Dexter...it just continues through this season. The Finale will BLOW YOU AWAY!
B001LX2J22|4.0|Not as good as Silence of the Lambs, but still a good movie. I liked it the second time around much more so that the first viewing.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like it, but after playing it twice I wont let me back in. I have no idea how to get back in. not a thing on Imangi Studios.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Fantastic show! Thanks to Amazon Prime, I can watch it over and over! I loved every episode and especially enjoyed the character development throughout the season. Great acting and I cannot wait for Season 2!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great book, relatively easy to read but still thoughtful and deep. Opened my eyes to move  than I thought going in.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|This is a very good release. The songs sound fresh and the band obviously rejuvenated with the new singer. Regardless of what \\"camp\\" you reside in, as a lover of music it is crystal clear to me that this release easily out shines FU in every way. Great job guys! You take the prize!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over!  I love Gru, the girls, and the minions.  Also, Pharrell's songs are the best.  His songs make this movie perfect.  I hope Despicable Me 2 is just as good.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Yep, has the fantasy component and a background story. Very good movie that should appeal to all.<br /><br />There's nothing more to say but a good movie to have in a collection.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A really wonderful picture that the whole family can enjoy.  Watched it with my grand daughter and I know both of us will remember it forever!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a quality program that I really enjoy. Definitely start at the beginning with Season 1. Beautiful photography, scenery, costumes, etc. Bravo!
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|been listening to the album on stream, and this is one of those few cases where i have it free and decided to buy it anyways. its just that good. gotta support real HIP HOP. cole is an emcee. most of these other cats are just rapping
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|Fun way to amuse yourself when you have a few minutes on your hands.  If it had music, it would be even better!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have a new book boyfriend and his name is Travis!!! This story had me from start to finish. I even held my breath during one of the tense moments of this story. Travis was just one of those characters you do not forget nor do you want to forget. There was some loving in this book that I would rate NC-17. But nothing to intense! I did buy walking disaster just to read Travis' side if the story as well! Both books are awesome!!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|I know nothing of the book so am not going to comment on that aspect.  The young man is funny and appealing, but the gal is rather dull and lifeless most of the time.  Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson save the day in this story of a caster/witch and a teenage guy who falls for her.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|I rarely buy a CD where I thoroughly enjoy every song on the album, and All The Little Lights was just one of these CDs.  I just happened to catch a small bit of Feather on the Clyde while watching a TV series (an admittedly silly, but in this case very effective, way to be introduced to great music) and after a little searching, happened upon this disc.  The lyrics are sometimes haunting, sometimes funny, but always moving and enjoyable.  Easily one of the best album purchases I've made in a while.  After a little more digging, I bought Mike's other albums and found his next closest concert to me.  I'm looking forward to the live experience.
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|I am a fan of Giacchino including Speed Racer, the first Star Trek film and the Incredibles; one day if they are smart, they will ask him to score one of the Bond films. This most recent soundtrack builds on themes and music from the first Star Trek film he scored and gives consistency to the second film as well as being a fun listen with a lot of exciting cuts. Bravo.
0891903313|5.0|I know there is some controversy over which translation version is the most accurate, something I only became aware of when I was trying to find the book I loved so much as a child.  I don't have much to say on which is most accurate, but I will say that this version, translated by Katherine Woods, is *my* Little Prince, and the one that stuck with me so much.  It took some searching but I finally found my hardback copy and I couldn't be happier.  This is a much loved addition to my personal library.  I first read this story as a child and it made an impression that followed me into adulthood.  A unique, far-fetched story with so much meaning and depth.<br /><br />\\"Men have forgotten this truth,\\" said the fox. \\"But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.\\"
B00942G4UA|5.0|My husband & I both watched this together! I watched it a few years ago so I really needed him to watch it as well so we might be thinking about our food in a closer, similar view. We were both pretty shocked on ALL of it! We were even amazed at the governments and the politicians who are VERY involved in this huge business industry of our country! Many people involved with/working for Monsanto, also work in the white house as they decide how marketing the processed food continues! This is really unbelievable that our food industry is not about making us feel better at all. It is about Making Money using chemicals & preservatives & GMO to get the attention of our taste buds! The administration of President Bush, Clinton & probably Obama is very unfortunate as they are all &#34;IN&#34; on promoting the manufacturing of continued processed foods, hormone induced & mistreated animals, and really how disgusting all of this really is. The narrator was right about there being a veil between the public & manufacturing process!!!
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|This movie continues the series with John McClain trying to help his estranged son.  Watch as John takes his Boy Scout antics abroad and the demolition and mayhem that follow.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I put a battery in my garage door opener, and now it works again.  Even if they don't last 1/2 as long as other batteries, who cares?  I got 5 for less than the price of 1.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love Pinterest so much but when I'm on my kindle fire for Pinterest, it glitches a lot!! When I'm trying to pin/edit/delete something, it closes the app constantly, saying that it has to force close, which gets really annoying!!! This is the only major problem with Pinterest for the fire, but otherwise, it's a really great app! But please fix this, it's been like this for the last 2 updates!!!!
1476733953|2.0|This book is boring, I can't get in to it. It's really slow and seems like a rip off of many 80's post apocalyptic scenarios. I have to give props to the author for even writing it and for all the acclaim it has recieved, but it just isn't something I'm in to, but you can't like everything so this is one of those for me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and provides a good challenge for your brain! It is very addicting as you finish each level and move on to another level which is a little bit harder.  Always exciting to figure out the puzzle!
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|I am a die hard fan,  I have all of the movies,  but this movie was lame,  about 1/3 of dialog is in russian, granted, it was made in russia,  BUT I DON'T SPEAK RUSSIAN, so I never knew what the F they where talkin about.  I could see some of frist part in russian, then it should have gone to english.  Action was OK, but--- sure a lot of CGI in this movie
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I purchased this after watching the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman.&#34;  Rodriguez's story is one of the most uplifting ones you will ever know.  Have tickets to his October 10 performance at Radio City Music Hall.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|I think this was a good movie,  good story, good cast,  I watched it twice in a row.<br />wasn't sure what kind of movie this was going to be, this is an all age viewable movie<br />hope they make more of these.
B00985E3UG|5.0|As a mother of two sons and now a grandmother, I read with disgust how the food industry markets their products to us.  I wish I had known about the dangers of processed foods when I was raising my kids.  At this point, I can resolve to eliminate as many processed foods as possible from my diet.  Having grown up on a farm, I should have known to &#34;keep it simple.&#34;  I highly recommend the book.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|bought this for my son's bday.  he has played both Lego Batman games and was so excited to see the movie - He loved it!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I bought this book after my friend told me how incredible each individual story was. I couldn't put it down. Read this book in 2 nights. Loved it.
B0018RFLN0|3.0|This is a good movie, but it's old. A classic you could say. I am watching all the Mission Impossibles in order so I had to start with one.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept me interested, because I wanted to know the outcome.  I love a twist in the plot , and this definitely had one.  I was a little disappointed in the abrupt ending.
B000IKQK7E|4.0|This movie is a classic funny movie. It is not something most young people have seen, but all should. Yeah
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has created a great story line with the Harry Bosch series. He is a tough guy but is always using his braqin to solve complicated murders. I hope he never retires.
0739384171|5.0|You definately need to read the books in this trilogy in their order, as this book takes up where the first ended and also references events in the first book.  I loved both so far and look forward to the last one (even though the author died before it was published).
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Nothing as a real CD at home!!! She is a real good singer, this is a really good gift for a girl.. amazing songs
B002AWX6UM|5.0|A story that people need to hear. This book is written in an eloquent and succinct style that drives home the message of the uselessness of war.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Got this for my 2 year old for his birthday party and love it! We have had it a few weeks now and no problems!! It was a hit with the kids and the parents at his party. I was worried about the reviews but decided to take a chance and I'm glad I did! I only wish that the back small pool didn't have a drain hole so that you can't fill it too high. I thought the slide not having stairs or anything would be an issue, but turns out its not at all. Love the little toys it comes with, especially the relaxing turtle! The instructions for the pool are very generic but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to blow it up. Very nice size, great that it has drain plugs, love the sprinkler. Overall, fantastic!!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|If you haven't read this book, what are you waiting for?<br />This acclaimed work by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons is just incredible. There's not much more to say than that. Read it. Re-read it. Everytime you do, you'll find something new.
1451696191|5.0|Not a fan of movie book covers, but everything was fine with the order. It is such a great book!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I miss the days when you could listen to an album from beginning to end and enjoy the entire thing because it flows so well.  The entire album feels like it was designed to flow perfectly from the order of the songs and of course the quality.  I know Layne was the best, but this new AIC rocks major ass!  Yes, its a different band from the early 90s, but it's very good.  I can't believe I didn't get this CD sooner.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Not a bad movie had some funny parts in it. Some parts were not to funny though and like half of them you saw in the previews

B00CDT41RY|4.0|Didn't like the nasty blood splatter. Was a little extreme. But otherwise, really liked it. Didn't even notice that it was 2 hours and 46 minutes long!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|There is a reason Star Trek remains popular.  Great characters, a good sense of humor, bad sets, and some pretty progressive sci-fi for its time made the tv series a part of the American vocabulary.  Episodes like \\"the trouble with tribbles\\" from season 2 are great for kids and adults alike.  In fact, I'm a lot more comfortable watching Star Trek reruns with my kids than most new TV series, and they enjoy them just as much, if not more, than most prime-time shows.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Always been a big fan since the original episodes.  I like the different modern twist they have done with the show.
0670023329|5.0|It is hard to believe as we sit in our comfortable homes...the hardships in these camps in North Korea continue to house families. Their hardships...ignored by the rest of the world. One cannot imagine the ultimate control by this brutal nation.... This story must continue to be told...over and over again. Please...stay informed.
B003L77G8I|5.0|I love this show. Every episode keeps you interested and wanting more.  If you like quirky crime dramas then this show is for you.  The chemistry between the main characters is more than captivating, It makes you want to keep watching :)
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|Fun offbeat movie. Well done. Some funny parts that make you chuckle. Not going to win any awards but was cute and entertaining.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this show. Every episode keeps you interested and wanting more.  If you like quirky crime dramas then this show is for you.  The chemistry between the main characters is more than captivating, It makes you want to keep watching :)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read this book in one day...all the while concerned that it would end too soon.  The descriptions in this book are so vivid that its almost like watching a movie.  Can't wait for the next book in the series.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love this show. Every episode keeps you interested and wanting more.  If you like quirky crime dramas then this show is for you.  The chemistry between the main characters is more than captivating, It makes you want to keep watching :)
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|There's a nice mix of intensity and melody in the \\"Pacific Rim\\" score.  The guitar is used quite frequently, something I love in movie scores because it is somewhat uncommon.  The first few tracks on the album capture your interest immediately and place you in that world, and then fortunately the rest of the album continues to provide a quality music experience.<br /><br />I have become a fan of composer Ramin Djawadi over the last few years, I particularly enjoy his work on \\"Game of Thrones\\".  He has become very good at infusing epic action movies with emotion and heart.  I think he was the right person to score \\"Pacific Rim\\".  In some ways, this score reminds me of Djawadi's work on the first \\"Iron Man\\" film - and that's a good thing.<br /><br />I'm very excited to see the movie, especially after hearing this score (which I think will work well based on the imagery I've seen from the movie).  This soundtrack is worth a purchase, and its definitely something that you could listen to multiple times.<br /><br />FAVORITE TRACKS<br />[1] Pacific Rim<br />[2] Gipsy Danger<br />[3] Canceling the Apocalypse<br />[7] Mako
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really fun game. Great graphics.  I am so glad this is on kindle fire. Awesome game!!! It might be more fun on ipad
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|This is the original House of Cards, and is it great!  We have loaned out our copy to relatives, and they are amazed!  If you haven't seen this, you must as it is so good!  No one is more of a villain then F.U!  What a treat.  I wish all t.v. shows could be this good!

B000EXDS5M|4.0|This adventure-buddy story with those two terrific actors is great fun. I still like The Sting Better, but this continues to be entertaining.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|The writing style was fairly juvenile and the whole experience was straight-up fantasy, but without any deeper points to make. Tolkien this is not, nor the chronicles of Narnia. The story itself was entertaining and epic, but the characters were not only difficult to engage with, the heroine came off as quite (and unnecessarily) thick sometimes. The male hero was about as likable as Anakin Skywalker in the second star wars prequel, and the secondary characters were one-dimensional and unbelievable. This might be something you'd want to read if you'd spent the last month or so reading classic literature or technical writing, and really just wanted a story that was easy to read and offered an escape, without actually demanding any brain power on your end. I won't be reading the sequel. The real question is, will the movie be better than the book?
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|The \\"Hobbit\\" was a wonderful story, full of humor and adventure.  Why did the director choose not to tell it?  After watching LOTR I was certain PJ would not get it right.  My worst fears were exceeded.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fun, with substance. Great for kids & adults. Avoids literary devices, and concentrates on showing philosophical ideas through the story itself, without sermonizing. Great ending too.
B000KIPT30|5.0|This product is a steal. Although it is a little awkward on desk but at $20 I can't complain. Behringer makes high value at low cost products and this is one of them. Low Noise floor. Great headphone preamps for project studio.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read something so unique, poignant, and gripping. This is not only a great story, but a literary masterwork, and you won't really notice how amazingly it's written because you'll be too busy devouring the story. In terms of descriptive writing, this book creates amazing atmosphere (and atmosphere is an important part of the book) and emotional tension, without resorting to any hackneyed ploys of writing. The characters are compelling and mysterious, and you learn more about them slowly, as they themselves slowly learn more and more about what's going on in the story. Read this book yourself, read it to your childern, lend it to your friends and co-workers. It's a gem.<br /><br />I sincerely hope this is turned into a six-hour miniseries by either BBC or HBO. I kind of wanted to start re-reading the book as soon as I'd finished it, and was so sorry it was over when I finished it in bed at 3:30am. Congratulations Ms Morgenstern, you are truly accomplished as a writer, and I hope we see more from you, and that you make piles of money!

1476734941|5.0|I found it easier to do without than to constantly count calories. When I bought the book, I had already been dieting and exercising for a year. It seems the method prescribed in this book got my weight loss started again. I fast (with 500 calories) three days a week and lose two pounds. This is better than my previous results on other diets.
B00785P2QC|1.0|No duh a tablet game that takes its frustrating slow pace to try and con money from you and blackmails you to post good things about it. Cant mobile gaming do better.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Of course it was the fairytale, but imaginative detail and realism made it much better than a cartoon. Young teens loved it, but I would judge it too scary for children under eleven. Most older teens and adults would appreciate the cinematic effects and even the story line.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who would of thought PBS to have a hit series. Love this show, makes me wish I lived back in those days.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|No monsters, vampires or zombies in this one - just a little time travel. Aside from that, it's vintage Stephen King; great writing, thought-provoking concept, memorable characters. I bought the Kindle version for my husband, because he needs to make the font extra-large these days. I still prefer an old-school hardcover novel - even the ones from Stephen King, all 900 pages of them. They make an excellent emergency doorstop!
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|This app is great. It gives you a selection of older guns as opposed to the original weaphones, which is all modern guns. I just think it needs more pistols.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Still love this show, but they cranked up the gore factor a hair this season and it's not for the squeamish - especially the episode about the guy with the leg amputation obsession... but hey, if a little blood bothered you, you probably wouldn't have made it through the first seven seasons, right?
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Awsome i really love it try it this app and u will see but sometimes run slow they have to fix it that
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|A little buggy but overall just as fun and entertaining as the other versions. Always fun feeding the little guy.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if not for the fact that I started it several months ago and put it down to read something else.  However, once I picked it up again, I couldn't put it down.  So many different plot twists I stayed up all night to finish it.  Unlike anything I've read before!  I recommended Gone Girl to my bookclub for this months selection, so I am anxious to see if they enjoyed it as much as I.
B00008GKEG|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best-told story of The Beatles ever produced. It has lots of unseen footage, great interviews with the surviving members, lots of original song sessions, many private home movies, and is just jam-packed full of Beatles information that most people don't know. A bonus is that there is a performance of two unreleased John Lennon songs - &#34;Free as a Bird&#34; and &#34;Real Love&#34;. Highly recommended.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|Normally a Sci-Fi buff, I completley missed this series when it was on TV (something about work scedules and other programs the rest of the family watched).  Now I'm thoroughly enjoying watching 2-3 episodes a week, commercial free!  The storylines are sometimes a bit transparent, but the interaction between the main characters is really great and often surprising.  A good show if you don't get too wrapped up in the technical details.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Alarm clock for a kindle fire? I didn't think it was going to be good but it is amazing for travel or at home
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series.  The background scenery is amazing.  I truly feel like I am there.  The storylines keep me on the edge of my seat wondering what will happen next.  It is a bit dramatic, but that adds to the enjoyment.  I love imagining what life would have been like to live in a gorgeous mansion like this.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I'm not sure why this book is filed away as 'Young Adult' in North America. It is a wonderful book. I must applaud Zusak - he took a subject that could be profoundly dark - that is profoundly dark, and at the end made me happy that I had read the book and experienced it all. I'm hesitant to talk too much about the plot for fear of spoilers, even though the author himself tells you throughout what is going to happen. Evidence of his mastery is the fact that even when you know what is going to happen it is a shock and a tragedy.<br /><br />Just read it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games and this game has that and more!  It gives you all kinds of bad guys to banish, quests to complete and rewards to be had!!  Plus play with all your friends on facebook and more!!  Lots of fun and something new around every corner!!

0670026557|5.0|While some may take a cursory glance at the premise of this book and discount it as an expounding version of the adage 'Give and thou shalt receive' they'd be doing themselves a disservice as this book goes much further than that.  It sets out to scientifically and logically prove that giving into our need to create meaning in our lives is directly tied to helping others.<br /><br />For far too long I have kept different mindsets for my professional and personal life.  At work, I admit that I've functioned more as a 'matcher', having a tendency to give to those who have given to me or have the potential to give to me in the future, but in my personal life I get to breathe a sign of relief and let distrust and rigid reciprocity fall by the way-side.  I give freely, expecting nothing in return or special recognition for good deeds.  The longer I maintained these opposing mindsets the more frustration they created in my life.  I've been seeking a different way to live and build meaningful relationships and that's what led me to this book.<br /><br />Adam Grant confidently states that being a giver is not a weakness or character flaw that needs to be trained away or (in my case) suppressed.  In fact, he provides numerous real life examples and scientific experiments to prove that people who actively give--those that integrate giving as a way of life have achieved the highest levels of financial and professional success.  This is so contrary to our societal beliefs that he gently and rationally counters many of the arguments skeptics would have with this claim throughout the book.  I'm convinced and I know that I will be all the better because of the impact this book has had on my life.<br /><br />Thanks, Adam for writing a truly liberating and revolutionary book!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love how this book connected with the the audience and told you of a young boy's struggle to fit in .I highly recommend this sad but happy story .

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|It's obvious since 1994's Promise Land that Queensryche have been in an alternative, straight ahead rock sort of slump. And when Degarmo left that just made things ten times worse by putting Tate(r) at the helm. Tate began chain smoking after Operation Mindcrime and he crippled his voice down through the years and it shows. A real shame for a former hero of mine, and many others. Now it sounds like a frog is living in his larynx and will never pop out. Also if he wasn't such a jerk people wouldn't mind either, but enough about that bald egomaniac. This album is spectacular in every way shape and form. Except for the fact they leaving you wanting more, because of the short length of the tracks and album overall. Which is small potatoes.<br /><br />Todd La Torre was a great, and actually very strange choice. He was originally a drummer for 24 years, and also played various other instruments but was never \\"really\\" in a signed band. He was only with Crimson Glory for not even 3 years and didn't even record with them. So this is his first studio vocal effort. And he does a superb job. Getting James \\"Jimbo\\" Barton back, who produced Empire, Mindcrime, and Promise Land was a brilliant idea, for getting that good old Queensryche sound back again. The first song \\"Where Dreams Go To Die\\", harkens of old Rage For Order Days, then skews off into the days of \\"Empire\\" with it's catchy chorus and great guitars. Most songs follow suit and all have great catchy choruses that stick in your head, which is what music needs today. No matter what kind it is.<br /><br />Spore is a brilliant song with definitely has the Rage for Order vibe to it, \\"In This Light\\" is a great ballad type track that really shows off the diversity of La Torre's pipes, and proves he's every bit of the singer Geoff \\"Jester\\" Tate once was. Redemption is as Empire as you can get, and really sounds like a bonus track from that album, and if it was 1990, would be all over the air waves. To bad we don't live in that great time period anymore. Vindication is a great Mindcrime type song is which La Torre talks about conquering all, and that they did. The great underrated track to me is \\"A World Without\\", which gives La Torre a chance to sing in that low Tate type voice we all \\"use\\" to know and love, and now we can again. This song resembles the actual song \\"Promised Land\\", only about 4 minutes shorter. And has a great moody, dark vibe about it. This song actually gets stuck in my head more than any other. For some odd reason. Don't Look Back, (and they won't), is a great straight forward fast Mindcrime type song, that much resembles \\"The Needle Lies\\", \\"Speak\\", and \\"Spreading The Disease\\", and does one kick A#$ job at it. I must say the songs are produced just like they were back then.<br /><br />If there is a weak track it would probably be \\"Fallout\\", which is still a good song, with a great chorus and Empire type vibe. Not close to bad, but just not my personal favorite. The last song, being the major ballad of course is Open Road. This song is a beauty, and has all the great making of the future and past of Queensryche. Many people might consider La Torre a clone but he does have is own sound, and variety of singing. Also a lot of dynamics. He also brings back the aggression on many tracks that hasn't been there in 25 years. And I honestly don't see how Rockenfield and the gang put up with it for so long. They couldn't have been happy. Now after all these years we have back a new a refreshed/charged band that sounds like they did nearly 30 years ago. Also i shouldn't neglect to mention that in an interview i listened to La Torre said they are working on their next album already! So that's what they are doing with all the new material they said was just laying around. I'm ready for more of this, and longer songs, which i'm sure we all are. This is a great taste of what's to come. And even though we live in a world where hight range vocalists are not \\"in style\\", that doesn't matter. I believe the next album will hit even harder. And they will legally get the name, which they so deserve. Your days are over Geoff, go join Hetfield in the retirement home. Not because you guys are old but because you turned into self absorbed money grubbing freaks. These guys are keeping it real, and now success is theirs for the taking. ;o)<br /><br />Minus one star for wanting MORE!!! ha

B009XIXVU6|4.0|After reading Hosseini's first two novels I was excited to read his latest book.  One of the things I like best about his writing is that he seems to have several story lines running at once, but in the end they all weave together to make a very satisfying conclusion.  His strong female characters also add to the tale.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I havewanted this game for two years now and I finnally got it because of my gift card. it is soo fun and worth seven dollars. there is no regret in buying it is awesome
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I love Queensryche's music.  Well, to be specific, I love Queensryche's music from their self titled EP through Promised Land.  Each CD since that I've purchased by them, I've been able to find at least a couple of solid songs but I've steadily grown disillusioned by their direction.  Hear in the Now Frontier, Tribe, and even American Soldier had a lot of good things going for them, but Q2K was weak and Operation Mindcrime 2 just didn't work well for me except for a couple of songs.  I couldn't even bring myself to try Dedicated to Chaos after hearing samples and reading the reviews.<br /><br />And then came the split.  I assumed I would never hear music similar to that on their earlier albums, but I was wrong.  I did listen to samples from Geoff Tate's version of the band, but he sounded sloppy, tired and uninterested.  So I didn't pick up that CD.<br /><br />I also heard Redemption and while I liked it better, I wasn't sold on it... Then I started hearing more samples, and more complete songs.  I liked what I heard, so I purchased the deluxe digipack from the official website (not Amazon).  I received it a week ago and have been wanting to write a review here since.<br /><br />It has stayed in my car's CD player ever since putting it there (after one spin on my home stereo system), and that's VERY rare for me these days.  I buy a lot of music and almost never listen to any CD twice in a row, let alone 5-6 times.  Part of it is because I'm just happy to have a solid slab of good metal songs from Queensryche again, but part of it is because this is a really good album.  It's not Operation Mindcrime (5 stars for me), or even Rage for Order (4.5 stars for me), and so it gets a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />The album as a whole reminds me most of Empire.  There are a lot of catchy songs, with great hooks and good choruses.  Initially I attempted to classify each song as \\"Which album could it most likely be found on?\\" but with each listen, it gets harder to do so as they all feel like an organic part of Queensryche, the new self titled album.  There are hard and fast songs (Vindication, Don't Look Back, and Fallout).  There are a couple of slower, complex songs (A World Without, Open Road), and a couple of solid rockers (In This Light, Spore, Where Dreams Go to Die).  Oddly, Redemption feels like my least favorite song on the album, but it's still pretty good.<br /><br />Todd LaTorre definitely pulls off the \\"young Geoff Tate\\" vibe, and that's a good thing.  Maybe Geoff Tate is less than praiseworthy these days both for actions he's taken, and for a declining voice, but go back and listen to early Queensryche.  The man had a beautiful voice for metal, and an amazing range.  Todd could almost make you feel like you're listening to the next Queensryche CD after Promised Land with no change in singer.  There are some moments where he has a slightly different style, but the perfection in the vocals - not an out of step or strained moment in spite of the vocals being very challenging at times - is very early Queensryche in feel.<br /><br />As a bonus, there are three live songs by the new incarnation of the band, which are a lot of fun.<br /><br />I really want to give it 5 stars, but I try to reserve those ratings for the true classics, and this is just a step below.  It is, however, a spectacular return to form by a band I've really missed the past few years.

B002ZG99A4|4.0|This movie is just as terrible as it is amazing. There is just something incredibly entertaining about getting so many action stars crammed into a single film and watching them blow crap up and toss catch phrases around like grenades. Solid action and fight scenes, little story plot. Pretty much just a fun movie to watch when you feel like watching stuff blow up and guns roar.

B008JFUPK8|4.0|There is much to like in MAN OF STEEL, the latest effort to re-make the one-time comic book icon into a national hero. Nowadays, it's not enough to have an action movie; in order to humanize a comic book icon it's important but to give the hero a strong sense of introspection, a psychological neediness. MAN OF STEEL lands somewhere in between: it's the story of a man who is not quite a superstar, and a hero who is not quite ready for prime time.<br /><br />Directed by Zack Snyder, MoS achieves its greatest successes in the first half of the film, having wisely decided to condense our hero's upbringing into only those certain new elements. Most already know the overall story: born on a crumbling Krypton doomed by overzealous energy demands, the infant Kal-El is sent to Earth by his scientist parents, Jor-El and Lara (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer). Whereas other films have concentrated on our super tadpole's upbringing by Kansan farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who instill in him humble middle-American values, MAN OF STEEL chooses not to relate any more of his story than is necessary to develop the plot. It's a wise move that makes the movie less top heavy, leaving us to glean only those elements necessary to this incarnation - it's only a shame they didn't follow this practice at the end, too.  More on that later.<br /><br />Henry Cavill is an interesting choice for Superman - the first non-American to play the part, he projects almost the opposite image in each of his personages. While I found him to be a virile, bold Clark - as comfortable holding up collapsing derricks as he is lifting buses - he projected a smiling calm as Superman, fitting in the suit as if his highly pumped pecs and abs were born to it...which, as it turns out, they were.  He's certainly credible as Superman, but I found him to be more interesting as Clark; that is, the pre-Superman Clark, when there was no disguise to dilute him. As Clark he was troubled, searching, and three-dimensional, and not only in the pay-four-extra-dollars-for-your-ticket kind. He seemed to lose that dimension when he divided himself: like a lobotomized patient, he was only half as interesting anymore.<br /><br />Yet still, the movie is compelling and enjoyable...certainly more enjoyable than [[ASIN:B000LB4DWO Superman Returns]], the Bryan Singer-directed movie starring Brandon Routh, I found myself liking MAN OF STEEL even while it tried to wow us with action scenes at the end that were a little too dependent upon the same stunts done endlessly: I mean, how many times do we have to see them knock each other through buildings?<br /><br />I don't know if the problem with the movie's third act was solely Superman's; I liked the concept behind a world having to come to term with this new alien in their midst. But there was simply something missing once they did so: having accepted Superman, it seemed the drama was replaced by bad guys, super-fisticuffs and exploding buildings.<br /><br />You see, our bad guys this time around are General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his fellow renegades, who led a revolt against Jor-El and the council because of their foolish raping of the planet's natural resources (sound familiar, anyone?). Banished to the Phantom Zone until Krypton's explosion frees them, they spend the next three decades searching for Kal-El, whom they believed to carry enough coded genetic information to re-animate their race. They decide to use Earth as a giant nursery upon which to recreate their species, wiping out all existing humans in the process.<br /><br />Part of the problem was that their conclusion chose the weakest elements of their story to promote. For instance, right from the beginning I thought General Zod's rebellion had legs; certainly, the council's actions DID destroy their planet...but now that Krypton was no more, his plan to destroy our race was simply too easy to dislike; their hope to recruit Kal-El/Clark could have have been interesting if they hadn't made Shannon's Zod so one-dimensional and unlikeable. Kal/Clark had spent the whole early film trying to find out why he was, in effect, a freak...couldn't Zod and his ilk have given him a more compelling choice to make in this regard? Shannon's a terrific actor - see [[ASIN:B006HGXGWU Take Shelter]] if you have any doubt. He would have quite ably handled a better script.<br /><br />Another problem for me - a BIG one - concerned a late-movie decision Superman was forced to make; it should have been more psychologically difficult for him, and other than a mighty shout the issue was over. Nothing more. This should have been another area of EXTREME importance to the myth, yet it was passed over like toppings on a pizza.<br /><br />These things said, I enjoyed the movie overall. Snyder has directed his movie capably, lending itself a proper air of fresh excitement. Indeed, there was even a sense of discovery here, and a palpable feeling of true franchise value. There were several Easter Eggs for the observant: LexCorp was written on the side of several trucks, and there was at least one mention of Wayne Enterprises. And the movie always kept a sense of fun: as Superman is sent crashing into a just-constructed wall, the OSHA sign there drops the 1 and 6 from \\"106 Days Without an Accident,\\" leaving just the 0. And there's a sign in a soda shop proclaiming \\"Go Smallville Spartans.\\" The tie-in? One of Zack Snyder's previous films was...[[ASIN:B000V39KDO 300]]. Go Spartans, indeed.<br /><br />While there were a few weak choices in writing, there were some particularly interesting ones concerning Lois. Ably acted by Amy Adams (check that alliteration!), she was no femme fatale, but a capable and loyal partner of not only Superman but also Clark the Reporter. While she needed a rescue now and then, she is the most capable Lois I've seen since Noel Neill, back in the days of black and white television of my youth. She not only gives the series a smart compass, but she will also likely serve as a \\"sidekick,\\" given this movie's script. I do believe that the core of this enterprise is a solid one, capable of leading the franchise onward. Other than those misplaced early steps, it looks like the movie is on solid footing.een interesting if they hadn't made Shannon's Zod so one-dimensional and unlikeable. Kal/Clark had spent the whole early film trying to find out why he was, in effect, a freak...couldn't Zod and his ilk have given him a more compelling choice to make in this regard? Shannon's a terrific actor - see [[ASIN:B006HGXGWU Take Shelter]] if you have any doubt. He would have quite ably handled a better script.<br /><br />Another problem for me - a BIG one - concerned a late-movie decision Superman was forced to make; it should have been more psychologically difficult for him, and other than a mighty shout the issue was over. Nothing more. This should have been another area of EXTREME importance to the myth, yet it was passed over like toppings on a pizza.<br /><br />These things said, I enjoyed the movie overall. Snyder has directed his movie capably, lending itself a proper air of fresh excitement. Indeed, there was even a sense of discovery here, and a palpable feeling of true franchise value. There were several Easter Eggs for the observant: LexCorp was written on the side of several trucks, and there was at least one mention of Wayne Enterprises. And the movie always kept a sense of fun: as Superman is sent crashing into a just-constructed wall, the OSHA sign there drops the 1 and 6 from \\"106 Days Without an Accident,\\" leaving just the 0.

0345529057|5.0|What a great story. watched the first three seasons on HBO and decided to start reading the books. only half way through the first book but it is great. Its a very nice box set especially for the price. I would recommend this box set to anyone that likes the show and to people that have not.
0062082353|5.0|This is an outstanding read.  If you enjoy military books and especially if you enjoy books about the Navy (SEALS) or Special Warfare, this is a book for you to read.  Most of the book details the numerous deployments that Chris Kyle was assigned to in Iraq.  He was part of the USMC push to take back Fallujah, the US Army push to take control of Ramadi, and the US Army actions in Sadr City.  A majority of the book talks about the details actions and his thoughts on what he did in these locations and some others while in Iraq.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the author's thoughts on what he did, why he did it, and what he thought about it.  The US lost a TRUE WARRIOR when Chris Kyle was killed in Texas by a former Marine who was suffering from PTSD.  Chris Kyle and a friend were trying to help this younger Marine get through and over his PTSD when something terrible happened.  Rest in Peace Chris Kyle...you are now with the Lord Jesus in a much better place where your outstanding skills as a Sniper are no longer needed.  You saved many lives and will be remembered always.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I bought this season for my boyfriends birthday and he loves it.  The packaging is different like people have said but for $30.00 less I really don't see it as a big deal and either did my boyfriend who buys every season he likes.  Its the exact same content and does have the list of shows on the back (even though its not attached).  Not a big deal!  Its very worth the price!  Even though I have to watch the show all the time now lol
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I&lt;3 this game<br />I love horses yet my horse is up at the ranch for the summer. It's sad not being able to ride him but I guess this can substitute .... I love the game
B005USZML4|5.0|This book had me hooked from the beginning. It is very well written and thought out. It pulled me in. This is now one of my favorites.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Love this movie and can't wait for the sequel!  Saw it at the movies and love adding it to my movie collection.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in years.  I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy it.  It was so well written that I could imagine myself in the midst of all that was going on. Kudos for a wonderful story!<br />Connie Clark
B008JFUUQ2|4.0|I decided that I had to get this after my roommate showed it to me and I just loved it. very fun to sing along with.
1401923127|5.0|WONDERFUL AND THOUGHT STIMULATING BOOK....on how the environment impacts us at the cellular level. He presents the biology in down to earth terms and then connects with the emotional and spiritual aspects. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this GAME! Can't get enough. a work out for the brain. always something new :) will keep u entertained for hours.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I gave this book 5Stars because just like all the Lee Child's books this one stands out.  I would recommend this book to all my friends thank for all you do .
B004W1GCNC|5.0|So many have Panned this as a poor effort to replace a beloved series but I for one say how sad BBC stopped it before it could take off yes its wonderful to see Rose again and see the inside of a great or nay minor house as it tries to weather the storms of life war and personal choices and yet its still heartwarming and touching I just wish they kept it going
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I started watching this as a fan of Damian Lewis.  Initially I was content to take my time getting through the series.  However, by the end of the third episode, I was so hooked that I couldnt watch the episodes available quick enough.  This show is very intense and actually quite frightening how it relates to current world situations.  I am dismayed that I am not able to watch the next season yet, and it will be even longer before I get to see season three!!  But I highly recommend it.  Damian is fantastic in his role.  You cant tell from one minute to the next if he is the good guy or not!!  Claire Danes does a great job as the CIA agent on the case.  Always love seeing Mandy Patinkin and the rest of the cast, especially Morena Baccarin are perfect!!
0875428940|5.0|would recommended to everyone i know the cards are nice n bright comes with a booklet thats very helpful i give it a 10+
0394721772|5.0|What an excellent book to have in any kitchen. The recipes are easy to read, understand, and put inot use.  Easy enough for an 11 year old to use.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|It was worth watching this movie.  It was an interesting prequel to The Wizard of OZ.  It started out a little slow in the beginning.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|This novel is used in our eighth grade curriculum for the mystery unit.  It has a slow start, and many characters to analyze, but the overall plot is suspenseful.
B004QKK9O2|5.0|What a story, and I too have started reading Great Expectations again just to get all the tie ins.  I haven't read Dickens since high school, but I need to know now all the references, and then I'll probably read this book again.  I have to admit that the thing that lead me to the book is that I'm a huge fan of Hugh Laurie, and I know he played Mr. Watts in the not yet released movie.  I saw the preview, and had to find out the \\"real story\\" behind it.  Now that I've read the book and will have completed GE by the time of it's release, I can't wait to see it on the big screen.  The preview of the forthcoming movie is on You Tube in case anyone else is interested.  This is a wonderful book, enjoy it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it but kinda silly to not make it with more levels before releasing it. hope its not one of those games that never updates.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|very fun game. I thought some levels were challenging! great way to burn some time. I would reccommend it to a friend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and addictive! Every level is a challenge but not too tough. Gives your brain a good workout. Lots of fun.
0470913029|5.0|An easy way to diet without actually denying yourself too much.  The premiser is that if we eat as our ancestors ate we eat in a healthier manner and avoid all that makes us put on weight.  In short , heavy carbs, such as wheat, corn and all grains are out  but are substituted by seeds and nuts. Same for legumes and sugars, the latter sustituted by honey, maple syrup etc.  It is easy to follow and very tasty.  Recipes are included and there is a wide variety of them on the internet..<br /><br />A very pleasurable way to eat healthy and lose some weight.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This review is strictly focused on the music, not on the CD product.<br /><br />This is an infectious album with an eclectic set of collaborators.  Every song tells a different story, and the music is constructed in such a way as to perfectly deliver each message while remaining very infectious.  Who cares if it includes &#34;Get Lucky&#34;? Such a popular single is a small fish in a big pond, and it approaches and passes by just like every other gem on the album.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase, or at least an honest listen. Just borrow a copy from one of your cool friends. If they're cool, they have this album. Seriously.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The storyline and costumes, the era, all well done. Anyone who enjoys historical slice of life stories would love this.
B005C7MVC6|5.0|The Pitchfork review does this album great justice. Please don't lynch me for saying that.<br /><br />This album is amazing.  Hauntingly beautiful music, cryptic lyrics, and the voice of an angel rising above or burrowing beneath it all.  Absolutely moving.<br /><br />http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15551-bon-iver/
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Never read the book, but the movie was great. Can't wait for the next one to come out. Watched it for free with Primemember
B005ERX1Z0|4.0|Was hoping for remastered picture and sound, c'est la vie? Guess thats not happening.  Still a fun movie to watch
B009186JYI|3.0|There were so many interviews with everyday people on the of Ireland and not much concert footage.  The only concert version was the Stones being attached during their third song.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Clever fun! This game has challenging puzzles and holds interest throughout the whole game! Highly recommended!I played for something like 4 hours! Fun and awesome!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The story plays out in a lovely English mansion about an artisocratic family who faces problems with their staff and problems with individuals in the family. It is well written, and will keep you magnetized intil you've seen every episode.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is a great movie. We actually rented it first and then a month later purchased the digital version! MUST SEE!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have never been so addicted to a book until now! Forget finding time, I made time for book 2 because the author gets you hooked on what's to come. The intrigue of Grey's shades of darkness keeps you wanting more. Its like a mystery thriller meets romance novel. Ana's subconscious & inner goddess are like additional characters as entertaining as the story line.<br />I'm afraid to read book 3 as I don't want the suspense, the intrigue, the blossoming romance & exploration of Grey's dark side to end.  I pray for a book 4, the screen play, something. E L James don't leave your readers this way!!!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I have this on repeat in the office and the car.  I never get tired of the songs.  She is an incredible artist.
0783229364|4.0|I grew up on Michael J. Fox, I like this movie and Back II the Furture. He is a great actor of comedy.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|I love it. It is action packed, but not much nasty.  It is funny at the same time.  Can't wait for part two.
B009R659L8|4.0|I have always enjoyed reading her books..this new one is as good as I remember her earlier books.<br />I would and have recommended this book to my friends.
B008D37J6O|1.0|HD Player (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008D37J6O/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title) failed to play flac files. I get static on one title, the other title had static on left and slow (about quarter speed) distorted on right.  Both play fine on my computer.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|I love this movie, always have and will. This movie is great for Entertainment, it is funny and it has some good battles scenes
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love these books, all of them, one, two and three and yes, if there is a 4th book, I will read that one too.  The first two books pull you in and give you the roller coaster effect of passion, lust and love. The third book doesn't quite take you as high on that roller coaster but that is okay, it shows that both Eva and Gideon are learning more about each other, to trust their actions a little bit more (most of the time) and that the outsiders who want so badly for this couple to fail have no or little power over their relationship.  Don't get me wrong, there is still the \\"OH NO\\" throughout the book that makes you want to get to the next page quickly but you are pleasantly surprised when Eva doesn't run out the door and sticks around to try and solve whatever issue needs attention.  Their need for each other is over the top at times but honestly, that is the pull for me to read these books...a lot of us want or desire a relationship that is a little bit of a fantasy and when we don't have that in our own lives, we get our fix through fictional characters such as Eva and Gideon.<br /><br />If I had taken the suggestions of many of the reviewers, I probably would not have read this book.  They made it sound like book three was more about Corinne and Megumi...not so !  But when a book is several parts thick, the authour has to bring in new characters or make current, somewhat insignificant characters more significant, it's just what has to happen but by no means is this book any less about Eva and Gideon and their drive and desire to be all that the other needs and wants.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it but please, please, please!  Don't take the other reviewers word for it either.  Buy the book, read it, and make up your own mind as to whether the \\"Most Likely\\" book four will be on your future \\"TO READ\\" list.
B0041VXGRS|5.0|I already know how to make cakepops, but I prefer the one that is baked through the babycakes machine. This book is great for design ideas and it did help me consider the option of customizing the shape and appearance of a cakepop. This is really fun to read.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I saw the movie and had to read the book. Not my usual read at all but I found I did not want to put it down. A very good read indeed.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Myles Kennedy's vocals are beautifully haunting, and when they're mixed with Slash's guitar style the experience is golden. Music doesn't get much better.
B000002KIK|4.0|I enjoyed this CD as it seemed Black Sabbath grew a little and played rock and roll instead of the same old bass sludge we have heard for so long. My guess is they also were tired of the same old stuff and wanted to grow.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|One of the mostly detailed interactive stories I have ever come across. My daughter was totally enchanted from start to finish. I wish there were more to the story. I do not want to give too much away, there are some tricks to using the book that take time to figure out - be patient. FYI - This story is NOT for younger children (under 5) , my daughter is almost 7 and thought there were a few scary images but nothing too bad.. I do hope they make more!
B004JMSIRC|5.0|My whole family loves this movie! We especially like the background story of how Tony Stark became Iron Man. Great entertainment!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My wife read this book as well as the other two in the trilogy and said that it was really a great book .
B000PMG16U|4.0|I purchased all of the Star Wars movies to introduce them to my son. While the prequel trilogy was not my favorite, he loved them. Episode 1 particularly appealed to him because of young Anakin Skywalker.
B00847KFDS|5.0|When I first read about this CD...I thought \\"Ohh Crap this is going to just be crap....\\"...but hey it's John Fogerty .so I had to buy it....BOY i'm so glad I did ...this album is a refreshing take on some classic music.<br />jF has created another masterpiece....He found the perfect way to blend some amazing artists with some of his classic songs.<br />I had so many doubts about the cast of players I hesitated so much even putting it into the cD player...Now the darn disc just isn't coming out.  I love this CD!
B000067FP8|5.0|This movie was as funny as I remember it from the theater years ago.  I wish they would come up with a modern day Gremlins.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works great.  easy to download. easy to use.<br />Did not expect to get such a great Item for so little money.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|This album is good, but I don't like it as much as some of their other albums.  There are some defiantly rockin' songs on here but others are just ok.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like the fact that I am challenged to think yet I don't have to strain my brain that badly. I am pleased :-)
B0090YHSFC|5.0|The kids love this, it is great for hand/eye coordination....  with the fast thinking and hand motion... great game, i like it too
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The story could have been written in less than one book; the rest was just filler fluff.  I kept wondering what the hype was all about; although the managed to use &#34;filler fluff&#34; to make a lot of money.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It is a very fun game to play anytime of the day and it doesn't give you notifications and that is a very good because it doesn't clog your devise with messages.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Great game. Love it. Could not stop playing. I like all of Rio games. Bring on more. Love it. Love it.....
B009JZTOG8|5.0|There is not a lot on tv these days, that is why we have cancelled our cable and now watch on Amazon.  Once A Upon a Time is great family viewing and perfect for all ages.  Some scenes may be a bit scary for the very young but we do highly recommend this series.  We watch with our 8 year old son and he loves it.  So do we.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in a very long time. Hazel is very relatable and understood, and you cannot help but fall in love with Augustus. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that has characters that you grow to love when you first read about them.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game is awesome. It is a thinking person's game. It gets better with every floor. I'm glad I found this game.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I am a Black American and I am engaged to a Nigerian. Although fiction, this book gave me a look into the Nigerian Culture. Also was interesting seeing the experience of a Nigerian as well as other Africans', assimilation into American and England culture. And the struggles of immigration.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was a really addicting sequel to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. I was extremely pleased with how this book turned out!
0761169253|4.0|An interesting slant on writing and living!  Well worth a read and adding to a home reference library!  I've followed some suggestions already.
B0063M22QO|4.0|ok, but need more options of different varieties of the game.  It was a little hard to view the pieces.
0307887960|5.0|If I had known weight loss would be this easy I would have done it years ago.  If my next blood draw is as good as the last one, my doctor will take me off cholestoral lowering medication completely. For now I take it three days per week and I feel fantastic. I went from size 12 to size 8.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was a fun game and I'm glad I have it. I want them to get more levels to play for even more fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun but lots of ads.  puzzles are fairly easy to do,  nice way to pass time and game is quick.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|Found this just in time for my nieces bday who loves monster high. When she opened the box , I kept thinking that there was something about the belt and her hair that led me to believe she might glow . So we put her under the light for a few seconds and then shut out the lights. Her belt and hair didn't glow, but her eyes did ! To be honest, it was kind of freaky. I had to keep telling my niece that she's good and takes away bad dreams. Still, I thought it was cool<br />Her hair is kind of dry looking- guess she doesn't get any moisture under the bed :) every time my niece brushed her hair, pieces came out so my sister finally coaxed her to let poor Twyla's scalp have a rest. She is a smaller doll but she's cute. Other than the dream thing , don't really see how she's the daughter of the boogeyman. The other dolls all seem to have better inspiration re their monster roots do its a shame that this one was kind of lacking. Wait for the cheaper price- dont pay over retail.
B003TGMFG4|5.0|Could not put this book down. Saw the movie first and read everything I could find about this young man...this book answered all my unanswered questions. The author did a great job with this story!
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This was a good read ... the characters are well developed and although I expected a sad ending, I found it very satisfactory.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|i was totaly satisfied with my order. Great music by Darius. plan to get more of his music. Saw one of his shows, loved it.
B006INDGFE|1.0|Since when is drugging your friends supposed to be funny?  I am sure this movie made money, but it is pretty pathetic.

B00CXL6XP0|4.0|Michael Wilton, Scott Rockenfield, and Eddie Jackson have gone on record several times and said they have a ton of unused material they have written over the years that has yet to see the light of day.  A quick listen to Scott and Whip's \\"mosh pit demos\\" proves that they aren't bluffing.  And yet, rather than use some of that already-written material, when Michael, Scott, and Eddie entered the studio to write Queensryche's latest self-titled album with returning guitarist Parker Lundgren and new vocalist Todd LaTorre, they instead chose to use only new material the five musicians wrote together specifically for the new album sessions.  This decision definitely makes a statement, but it is also incredibly risky.<br /><br />The risk paid off.<br /><br />Everything about the classic Queensryche sound that fans have come to know and love over the years--things that have been conspicuously absent for several albums--are back.  But instead of sounding like tired retreads, the songs have a freshness and originality to them that is very satisfying.  In short, the songs sound huge and complex.  Even the songs with very straightforward, standard arrangements have a depth and complexity to them that rings of Queensryche of old.  The complex, multi-layered guitars are back.  The relentless, driving rhythm section is back.  The little sonic nuances that add texture and atmosphere are back.  The vocal harmonies that give added dimension and emotion to the vocals are back.  The thoughtful and thought-provoking lyrics that make the listener think without telling him or her what to think are (finally!) back.  All the things a lot of long-time fans missed that made Queensryche a truly unique band are back.<br /><br />But, as I mentioned above, Queensryche is much, MUCH more than simply a nostalgia trip.  Yes, the core sound of the band has finally returned.  Let's not forget that 3 of the 4 members who actually wrote the MUSIC of Queensryche (not just the lyrics and vocal melodies) are present.  And with Parker Lundgren and Todd LaTorre joining the songwriting team, the band has two talented musicians who are both fans of classic Queensryche and who have made themselves students of what made that classic Queensryche sound.  The flip-side is that the songs sound modern and bring plenty of new energy to the table without sacrificing what made the band great in the first place.<br /><br />A few comments about the performances on the album.  Michael and Parker really did a fantastic job of blending catchy riffs, huge open chords, and harmonized solos that immediately let the listener know that this is indeed a Queensryche album.  But perhaps the stars of the album are the rhythm section of Eddie and Scott.  The two are absolutely locked in.  The drumming is intense and creative, and Eddie's bass sound is huge and \\"in your face.\\"  Rather than sit back on the songs, the rhythm section truly drives the songs and gives them huge punch and energy.<br /><br />But what about LaTorre?  Does he live up to the hype?  As someone who thought Geoff Tate was an integral, irreplaceable fixture of Queensryche, I have to say:  yes, he absolutely does.  Many may accuse Todd of being a Tate clone.  And to be fair, there are times when it is uncanny how much he sounds like Tate, right down to his vocal phrasing and enunciation.  But while Todd is able to pay respect and homage to the signature vocal sound of Queensryche, he brings plenty new to the table as well, and there are many places on the album where his own style shines through.  What is clear to this fan is that Todd clearly gets that people want to hear a certain style of vocals when they listen to Queensryche, and he delivers that style in exemplary form and truly pays respect to Queensryche's legacy.  But at the same time, he is not merely an imitator.  He sounds genuine, powerful, and passionate about the vocals he is singing, and it is clear that he is not merely the \\"hired gun\\" replacement singer, but is a fan of the music and is committed to not only pay homage to the Queensryche sound, but also just as committed to take it to new places.  I completely understand the sentiment of many who just somehow find it impossible to identify with a band without Geoff Tate as \\"Queensryche.\\"  Replacing a singer, especially one with such a distinctive voice and style as Tate, can often make a band somehow feel like a cheap imitation rather than the real thing.  But after hearing LaTorre with Queensryche, any doubts I may have had have completely vanished.  I hope those else out there with similar doubts will give the new Queensryche an open-minded listen and a chance to make a similar impression.<br /><br />It should be obvious that I am incredibly impressed by this album.  This is easily the best complete collection of songs the band has done since Chris DeGarmo departed in the late `90s.  Given what the band has done since then, I honestly did not expect to like this album as much as I do.  It is solid from start to finish.  But it is not perfect, hence my rating of 4 stars.  It is a huge step in the right direction, and I am a very happy, satisfied Queensryche fan for the first time in over a decade.  And even the minor flaws do not take away from that.  The only real criticism I have is that the album is short.  That is true both in terms of album length and song length.  Some of the songs just feel like they needed a bit more space to breath and a bit more time to develop.  Had some of the songs been extended a bit, this could be a near-perfect album.  But still, it exceeded expectations, as far as I am concerned.  And the stellar performances on the three live bonus tracks on the special edition make up for the album feeling a bit short as a whole.<br /><br />A quick note on production:  The mix is EXCELLENT.  There is so much balance, and every instrument gets its own time to shine in any given song.  The mastering, on the other hand, leaves a bit to be desired.  The album is mastered very hot, which makes for a very loud and sometimes distorted sound that detracts a bit from an otherwise spectacular sounding album.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a true return-to-form.  Given their history, as well as the tumult of recent events, Queensryche had a lot to prove.  This album shows that they are clearly headed in the right direction and, for the first time in a long time, makes me anxious to see what they do next.s a fan of the music and is committed to not only pay homage to the Queensryche sound, but also just as committed to take it to new places.

It is a huge step in the right direction, and I am a very happy, satisfied Queensryche fan for the first time in over a decade.  And even the minor flaws do not take away from that.  The only real criticism I have is that the album is short.  That is true both in terms of album length and song length.  Some of the songs just feel like they needed a bit more space to breath and a bit more time to develop.  Had some of the songs been extended a bit, this could be a near-perfect album.  But still, it exceeded expectations, as far as I am concerned.  And the stellar performances on the three live bonus tracks on the special edition make up for the album feeling a bit short as a whole.<br /><br />A quick note on production:  The mix is EXCELLENT.  There is so much balance, and every instrument gets its own time to shine in any given song.  The mastering, on the other hand, leaves a bit to be desired.  The album is mastered very hot, which makes for a very loud and sometimes distorted sound that detracts a bit from an otherwise spectacular sounding album.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a true return-to-form.  Given their history, as well as the tumult of recent events, Queensryche had a lot to prove.  This album shows that they are clearly headed in the right direction and, for the first time in a long time, makes me anxious to see what they do next.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, fun. Requires thought, needs more or levels though. Completed the game a.k.a. all of the whole, maybe 10 levels, in less than a day.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right level of difficultly to keep you entertained. One of the best free games that I have downloaded.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|...you can call it that. I love Neil Gaiman's writing. He's a really GOOD writer in an era where there aren't many, and his stories are wonderful. This one was just too short...Somewhere in between a short story and a novel... The author mentioned that it started out as a short story. I'm thinking he didn't expand on it enough to really call it a novel... but, great story anyway.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a very well constructed game. It keeps you hooked and for the kids is a great mental challenge! The only thing missing is more floors...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Only dislike is there are no instructions on how to play...or I missed them. There aren't any hints either. It is a game that makes you think a little.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|It's really quite simple.  If you were EVER a fan, if Queensryche was EVER important to you, you need to buy this CD.  Queensryche is back!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Very interesting book! I could not put it down! Amazing how many facts the author could unearth!  I would recommend!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|Returning to change my review to 4* as I have received my new mouse and used it for a little while. I moved to this mouse from a logitech mx518 and so far I like the change (mx518 has lasted me many years, just wanted to try something new). Overall this mouse is pretty good for the money, high dps, good feel, awesome customization of the lighting on it, and pretty good software for the mouse.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that this game is really fun and mysterious I think that there should be<br />hints and should have more improvements
B00BBIAB0Y|5.0|Sometimes a writer amazes me and then I have to acknowledge him/her as not just a writer but an AUTHOR. THIS WAS AS GOOD as a book gets'
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I really liked how they set up Wizard of Oz by giving us the background of all the characters. The imagery was excellent and the story was very good. The only thing I cannot get past is the innuendo (it was actually a bit more obvious than this) of Oz sleeping with all these women. This is supposed to be a story for kids but this threw me.
0374531269|5.0|Should be required reading for all middle-schoolers, especially boys. And their parents. And Christians. As the world becomes more dangerous, we should all be aware of the depths of depravity we are all capable of, given the choices and options this boy had. What is the right response? Christians should consider whether the constant diet of sugar-coated Jesus presented at church and Sunday school is actually preparing us to deal with this world - or the people who actually experience these things. How do we welcome them here and present Christ to those who don't think they've experienced Him? Excellent thought-provoking issues. I admire Ishmael immensely.

B005LUJWMG|4.0|I can remember the Iranian Revolution, when the Shah was deposed and Bakthiar took over, so it was most interesting to get a more detailed picture of the situation as it unfolded.<br /><br />Ken Follett, as always, writes very well and keeps the plot moving along.
B006PAZMMK|5.0|I bought it for one song, but I like all of them now. If you are into gaming you should look up osu. It is a DDR for the mouse and keyboard. Some of the songs here are used in it.

B00CHRB9RM|5.0|The timing is perfect for the 40th anniversary release of the Allman Brother's album \\"Brothers And Sisters\\". Rounder Record's retrospective of Duane Allman has been a huge success, Gregg Allman's bio \\"My Cross To Bear\\" has gotten rave reviews, as well as his latest solo outing \\"Low Country Blues\\". With \\"Brothers And Sisters\\", we can revisit the many contributions of Dickie Betts-the man who truly stepped up after the deaths of Duane and bassist Berry Oakley.<br /><br />For a short time in late 1971-early 1972, the brothers carried on as a five piece band after Duane's death. Hiring another guitarist to replace Duane was out of the question, so Alabama pianist Chuck Leavell was brought on board. This was a gamble, but a brilliant move. Betts carried the burden as the only guitarist in a band heralded for its twin guitar attack. Chuck's piano gave the band a jazzier direction and harmonized with Bett's lead lines beautifully.<br /><br />The brothers were recording Brothers And Sisters\\" when tragedy again struck-Berry Oakley was killed in a motorcycle crash similar to Duane's on November 11, 1972. Again the band moved forward, recruiting Lamar Williams, an old friend of drummer Jaimoe who impressed everyone during his audition.<br /><br />\\"Brothers And Sisters\\" was recorded chronologically-\\"Wasted Words\\" and \\"Ramblin' Man\\" are the only two tracks from the original release to feature Oakley. On the remastered edition, the bass is heard to much greater advantage. Although \\"Brothers And Sisters\\" is far and away the best selling of the Brother's albums, quite a few listeners found the original mix to be \\"muddy\\". The improvement is evident on Bett's compositions \\"Southbound\\" and the instrumental \\"Jessica\\", while the tandem drumming of Jaimoe and Butch Trucks stands out in \\"Come And Go Blues\\" and \\"Southbound\\".<br /><br />The previously unreleased tracks have some real surprises-\\"Southbound\\" is an instrumental outtake featuring the nimble piano of Leavell. On this track, one really appreciates the seldom recognized beauty of Bett's rhythm playing. \\"One Way Out\\" is an instrumental rehearsal where Oakley's bass takes off as a lead instrument. \\"Double Cross\\" is a Gregg Allman outtake which would wind up a year later on \\"The Gregg Allman Tour\\" double LP.<br /><br />\\"A Minor Jam\\" is just that-the band jams in minor key. What makes this cut interesting is the guitar of Les Dudek, studio guitarist who plays behind Betts on \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and \\"Jessica\\". He sounds remarkably like Betts, and his call and response with Leavell is engaging. Chuck would pursue this sound a few years down the road with Sea Level.<br /><br />The third and fourth discs were recorded at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom on September 26, 1973, and broadcast on KSAN, the city's album oriented radio station. The band features several cuts from the just released \\"Brothers And Sisters\\", including \\"Wasted Words\\", \\"Ramblin' Man\\", \\"Come And Go Blues\\" and \\"Southbound\\". The Brothers have played Willie Cobb's' \\"You Don't Love Me\\" many times over the years, usually incorporating another song into the performance; here they segue into the traditional \\"Amazing Grace\\". Without taking a breath, Betts leads the band into \\"Les Bres in A Minor\\", another Betts instrumental from \\"Eat A Peach\\".<br /><br />It's hard to imagine \\"Blue Sky\\" with only one guitarist, but Betts pulls it off with the great piano of Leavell and Gregg's organ and harmonizing vocals. \\"Trouble No More\\" is as strong as the version on \\"Fillmore East\\", and the obligatory \\"Whipping Post\\"retains its dark flavor with the help of William's foreboding bass.<br /><br />Of the seven original tracks on \\"Brothers And Sisters\\", four were penned by Betts; he also wrote \\"Les Bres\\" and \\"Blue Sky\\". Hopefully, his contributions will be appreciated with this 40th anniversary set. Sadly, Lamar Williams passed from lung cancer in 1981 (thought to be from Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam), but the other musicians on this album can beproud of the music they made-and continue to make. Bouquets for the living.proud of the music they made-and continue to make. Bouquets for the living.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I feel that this app showed easy and simple game play that was fun and engaging<br />the houses look very realistic
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Watched this with my babies after not seeing it for years.  It was still fantastic.  Even better graphics than I remembered.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This has been the best series of books after Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I read it so very fast. It is the epitomy of a womans fantasy.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|If is a good game than makes you think. It also test your memory. I thought it was going to be childish but it Isis not.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I did enjoy this well written book  ,makes you think about relationships and how things  that we have no control over shape our lives.<br />This book is very thought provoking ,but not difficult to read. We are often quick to judge others but unless we have been in their shoes we have no right to judge .
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Hadn't really heard anything about this movie. Watched it. Laughed a lot. Loved it. Would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes silly comedies.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Same format as his previous blockbusters, but in a different location. Why fix what is not broken?<br />However, I learned a lot about the history and the landmark sites in Washington and the links between American History and the Freemasons, things that I did not know before, even though I have visited Washington D.C. many times before.
0307950654|2.0|This book, I must say, was quite, quite boring and it repeated various bits of background information over and over, perhaps in hope of reaching a suitable book length. I would have expected better from a writer as skilled as P.D. James.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really fun game ! was not too hard,  or too easy! I would recommend this to anyone that likes to think a little and likes to solve puzzles!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I am so grateful the mono disks were not compressed like crazy.  I can crank the volume up past eleven and the sound gets better and better.  No ear fatigue as the dynamics allow the songs to breathe and punch the way the Beatles intended.  Highly recommended to those who like to hear their Beatles LOUD!

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Like so many other fans of Queensryche their last two efforts with Tate are beyond disappointing.  They're just flat out terrible and Tate has lost his voice which is sad because his voice was one of the things that turned me onto to Queensryche.  But these days he bottoms out and it just makes listening to anything he puts out not worth doing so.  I would venture to say that if 'Frequncy Unknown' or 'Dedicated to Chaos' were released during the eighties would QR be where they are today?  With that said, I was anticipating this release like so many others and think it's a worthwhile effort.  As in some fans who killed this for the production value I knocked off one star just for the lack of time on this release.  But it can be argued that quality can make up for that.  Point taken because whereas 'Frequency Unknown' clocks in at 64 minutes (that includes the bonus tracks) and this release only at 35 minutes, the difference is night and day as to which album wins.  Hands down this release brings a little bit back to the Queensryche that fans know and have listened to faithfully over the years.  As so many have already said there really isn't a bad track here so I won't bother going track by track other than to say that when you listen to this compared to Tate's version of Queensryche and their release this year you won't feel like you're listening to fingernails running down the chalkboard.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was lucky enough to win this in a contest, who doesn't like free?? Instead of being  written from the female POV it was written from the male POV. And he was so funny! Even my daughter caught me smiling while I was reading this. I have over 1300 books on my Kindle and this one ranks in the top 5! I highly recommend this book!
B009CF3MEK|5.0|Awesome story, awesome acting. Love this movie,  Cannot wait to see latest remake to see how it compares this is a great love story
B009JZTP4Y|4.0|As a trekkie, I can appreciate what this movie had to offer.  Yes, the special effects are not close to what we have today, but the story and the characters will always be timeless.<br /><br />Live long and prosper.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Can't believe this show is on NBC. This is one of the smartest and best shows on television. Everthing about this show is top notch. From the actors to the sound track...excellent.
B0094K20FK|4.0|Being a trekkie I remembered when the bugs came out of Chekhov's ear.  I did not want to go to sleep let alone go camping.  After watching this again, I remembered the chills I got from that scene.  Also, this movie has one of Captain Kirk's most epic lines:<br /><br />KHAAAAAAAN!!!!<br /><br />Live long and prosper.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|With one of George R.R books it seems when you start you always need to have More! I love these books and will read the next one for sure.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Is one of my favorite movies and although I am able, through my prime membership, to see it for free, I also wanted my own copy to share with family members and think it is a worthwhile purchase as everyone loves this movie as do I.

1594204217|5.0|I don't agree with Pollan when it comes to food politics, but that didn't make much difference when it came to this book. COOKED may turn out to be his masterpiece.<br /><br />Pollan's ideas have become so politicized that many of us tend to ignore or overlook Pollan as a writer. And the guy is GOOD. REALLY REALLY GOOD. This is a fine work of art. Gorgeous prose, thoughtful analysis (again, I mostly don't agree).<br /><br />I'm not sure there's a better writer working in the US today (of either fiction or non-fiction).
B000I9VZJ8|5.0|I Got this for my teenage daughter. She loved it! So' this went over well! It got here on time and was in good condition too
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Lots of fun! This App has successfully guessed every character, celebrity and famous person I challenged it with.  It's worth its price.
B00144VBBS|5.0|I can't stand Toby Keith. But my husband loves his music. He was happy with my purchase for him though!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Being a Sherlock Holmes fan made me a little skeptical of this new series. The characters and plots, set in contemporary London, were identifiable with Doyle's books, yet added new dimensions and their own quirkiness. I could watch the series several more times and still enjoy it.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The movie was funny and entertaining for the whole family.  We were unable to make it to the movie theater when this was out and we wanted to see it.  It was enjoyable.  Truly a family movie.
B008JB4XX2|5.0|A friend has been showing me a lot of classic rock and metal from the 80s including Whitesnake. Some of the other reviews compared Eclipse to this them, so I decided to give them a shot. I disagree that they sound like Whitesnake, at least not vocally. If I were to compare them to anything, it would be Dragonforce without the guitar solos. Everything blends nicely and I've enjoyed listening to the entire album several times over. Standout tracks are definitely Ain't Dead Yet and Battlegrounds. I would recommend this cd to anyone that likes solid anthem rock. Hope they take a tour through the northwest so I can see them live.
B000J2BRQU|4.0|The movie is good and gives you the background for the Tokyo character that appears in the next few movies.  I enjoyed it.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I'm honestly not as prepared to write this review as I hoped I would be.<br /><br />I've given this album close to 12 listens at this very moment, and while I like it very, very much, it feels to me that they have had to take several small steps back in the progression of their sound to take a giant step into their future.  This is not a bad thing though, as it helps this band to remember where they came from.<br /><br />The musical arrangements have become more complex again, which is something that I've been dying to hear for a long time.  Over the course of the last 10 years I've listened to bands like Dream Theater, Kamelot, To-Mera, and Leaves' Eyes and often thought \\"This is the musical path that Queensryche should be on.\\"<br /><br />And here they are in 2013, taking some serious steps toward joining their progressive/symphonic metal contemporaries.  It's a fine return to form, no doubt, but it leaves you wanting more.  Just as you feel yourself getting seriously into the meat of the song, it comes to an abrupt end, as if the ends are rushed just a little.  If these songs had a bit more time to marinate, they could have been the most juicy pieces of music ever added to their catalog.<br /><br />That's not to say these aren't good songs.  These are VERY GOOD songs.  The album rocks, and flows, and has peaks and valleys, and a sonic landscape that is not easily traversed, but by the time you have, it feels like it was an easy climb.<br /><br />It's great to hear top notch production here again, with all the instruments standing out on their own.  This has been missing for a while in the muddy mixes of the last few albums.  But even more noticeably present is the passion in which these songs are being performed.  These guys are hungry again, and it shows in the music.  How bad do they want it?  Pretty badly I would say.  Some favorites on this album would definitely be \\"Where Dreams Go to Die\\", \\"Spore\\", and \\"In this Light\\".  \\"A World Without\\" is sure to become the next fan favorite ballad, and the first single \\"Fallout\\" is sure to become a memorable anthem in their setlist for years to come.<br /><br />All in all, this album will rock your face off.  Give it a spin, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The Good:  Where Dreams Go to Die, Spore, In This Light, A World Without, Open Road<br />The Bad: (not saying there's a bad track on here, it's just my way of categorizing) Fallout, Don't Look Back, X2, Midnight Lullaby<br />The Ugly: (same principle applies) Redemption, Vindication.<br /><br />8.5 out of 10<br /><br />I'm Rik Johnston and I approve this message, even though I am tired as hell...

B000XUBFE2|5.0|An interesting perspective on WW II Germany. I loved the characters and enjoyed the different &#34;voices&#34; that came through in the writing style. Wonderful book!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|My son and I loved this movie! Rented it, then bought it... I had to have it! Although, I wish there was a discount for purchasing movies after you've already rented them!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed the writing style. Some characters were developed completely and in depth but were left in a dead-end story line. When lives did cross paths, however, the connections were interesting. I appreciated the message of how women were treated differently depending on location/circumstances/etc. A very good story, but I thought there were some holes in the plot that left me wondering what happened.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Almost all of Webber's work is genius... and I'm sick about not being able  to see his Love Never Dies Sequel.I saw the previews on my laptop, but it won't work on my regular player.

B003K15INU|4.0|Love the book, very insightful. What is up with all the typos? Seriously, I have found this to be true for several digital books, but this one was horrible. The cost of  these books is much too high for the consumer to be happy with the purchase. Whomever is responsible please get it together.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is a love story of many complexities between two young people, Chris and Emily, whose families have been neighbors all their lives.  Jodi Picoult interweaves the personalities of both sets of parents while telling us the story of their offspring who cannot conceive of life (or death) without the other being there.
B00195BM3Y|5.0|Nice collection / re-mix of this classic LP.  The live show (although&#60; not up to the best sound quality) is nice for historical event.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I began streaming this last week because I just never had the time to watch when it first aired.  Many of my friends have raved about  and I wanted to find out why.  Big mistake.  I am now completely out of control, to the point where it's  'just one more episode and then I'll quit'.  It's worse than sitting down with a quart of Ben & Jerry's and thinking you'll just have a few spoonfuls. This is one of the best TV series I have ever seen.  The plots are compelling and the characters are multi dimensional and believable.  Most of the episodes I've seen so far (I'm on season 2 right now) have had well-constructed, lucid plots with an adroit blend of tension, humor, and pathos  The writing is tight and the acting superb.  At first I could not figure out Alicia but she's becoming clearer to me now and I like the fact that nothing is black and white, it's quite gray - the way people and situations are in the real world. It's a good sign when a viewer keeps thinking about these characters and trying to guess what the writers are going to do to keep the law firm tension thread going.  It's difficult  to put together a network TV show that stays fresh, doesn't insult the intelligence of the more discriminating viewers, yet keeps enough people tuned in to make money and please the network and sponsors.  I hope it lasts.
B008NAFDF6|5.0|Replaced my tiny/dying 8gb SSD drive in my Acer Aspire One ZG5 with this.  The Bios recognized this drive immediately on bootup and it works great!  Brought new life to my 6 year old netbook.  Installed Ubuntu and it runs like new.
1451627289|4.0|What a page turner.  Best book by King that I have read (although I have only read about 10 or so of his novels).  This book is easily one of the top 20 books I have ever read.<br /><br />There are plenty of detailed plot descriptions in the other posts, so I won't go into that in my post.  What I will do is list the highs and lows from my point of view.<br /><br />Great beginning...the book grabs you from the start with the revelation that a time portal exists in the pantry of a man's diner.<br />Great middle...a fine description of life in another era, complete with sock hops, friday night football, and illicit love affairs.<br />Detailed description and discussion of the 18 months prior to the Kennedy assassination (this can be a high or a low depending upon your own personal preference).<br /><br />I'm torn about the ending (Partial spoiler to follow...).  I didn't particularly like it, which is why I rated the book 4 stars instead of 5 (I would have voted 4 and a half stars if that was available).  King I feel painted himself into a corner with the ending - he says as much himself in his afterward where he credits his son with the idea for the ending.  He constructed the story in such a manner that Jake the central character has to choose between the woman he loves and saving Kennedy's life.  This is a no-win situation and leads to a less than desireable outcome from my point of view.  I have no idea whether King did this on purpose or it just worked out that way.

It is a must buy if you are a comic book fan or love the comic style art.
B00A861QMM|4.0|the developer needs to shorten the storyline and/or stop it from dimming when it's talking. other than that, i like where during the hidden object scenes you have to do something with the things you find.if you like games that require thinking, then this is a decent game to play.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I know some critics gave less than glowing reviews of this film, but of the critical reviews I've read it seems to me that most of the problems people had with the movie boiled down to it not being the same Superman that we all knew and loved from the Richard Donner/Christoper Reeve era. Don't get me wrong I loved the and still love Superman I and II from \\"back in the day\\", but I also really loved this new take on the character and his origins and the films more complex and serious themes. The Donner/Reeves movies were wonderful, but they were set very much in a comic book world and limited by the special effects of their day. This movie is set in a world meant to be very much like our own - less black and white with more shades of gray. Superman is not the \\"big blue boyscout\\" that some reviewers feel he must be, but the character wants to be that and is striving toward that and is learning as he goes. I expect in a Man of Steel II we'll see a Superman much more sure of himself and much more certain of who he his and what he wants to be to the world. As for this movie, it's full of great performances all around, with the obvious standouts, being Michael Shannon as Zod, Amy Adams as Lois and Henry Cavill in the title role. All three bring something impressive and new to the characters they're portraying. Zod is the bad guy of course, but his motivations are ones you can understand if not agree with and Lois is much more than a mere love interest or damsel in distress. Superman himself - well, he's not Superman yet really - this is his journey to become that and Cavill portrays that conflict, doubt, pain and triumph so very well. My favorite surprise of the film was Jor-El played by Russel Crow. His Jor-El is so much more active and a driver of the plot, I won't give anything away, but he was a real hero in his own right. The action in ths movie is incredible, simply the best superpowered combat ever seen on screen and, while fairly bloodless, is nontheless sometimesbrutal in its intensity. As to the music, I alwasy loved the John Wiliams theme from the old movies and I did miss a big, distinctive theme at the opening of this movie, but Hans Zimmer's score for Man of Steel is simply brilliant. It's at times quiet, at times brooding and at times relentless in it's power. The use of percussion is incredible. Overall, I would call this a great movie, a visually stunning re-birth of an iconic character and an experience not to be missed by fans of superhero, action and sci-fi. All this great stuff being said this movie is not for little kids, it's rated PG-13 for a reason, and while all kids are different, I think parents should hold off on letting kids under 10 watch this and even 10 and older kids should watch it only w/ a parent present to answer questions and explain the context of events.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The movie is amazing!!! there is lots of warfare action and awesome animated effects. there are many different kinds of monsters such as dragons, goblins, trolls, wolves and of course golem is back!!! nice to see Frodo too. great movie rent it and enjoy the long journey.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I would really like to use this app. But it is a real energy hog. An alarm clock that takes more power at night then my GPS and drains my battery if its not plugged in is not a useful alarm clock
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I can't quit playing this game it's fantastic! It's so.addictive. I really do recommend this app.  Use it to let time fly. !
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great acting, great writing, never a dull moment. I have never seen it on TV and was glad I found it on Amazon Instant.  Luckily I had an Amazon Prime membership so it was free.
B000FA675C|4.0|I think Leonardo would be very proud of Dan Brown's intense and intriguing novel. Very well written, the scenery was detailed, the plot intense! Perfect example of a perfect book!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait to see Season 4! I didn't think I would like the series, but I'm hooked. The characters are each very interesting.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Thai is a pretty good game, considering you can spawn whatever you want. You can change the emotions, size, and even looks of everything. The only thing I wish they would change is the spawn limit to things. I sometimes want to build an army of zombies or something, but can't because you can only spawn a certain number of items.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I liked it because it had a smaller clock face. The small button on the side of the watch, however, is very hard to push out & in. Also, the time stops every once in a while, usually every or every other night (very late).<br />I, therefore, can't recommend it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is fantastic. I am so happy, it is a great buy and is never boring. I have made a cool place and love it, it feels like I am running a whole city.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I got this album when they did a $.99 special for the whole album. I like almost every song on the album and would have enjoyed it just as much if I had paid full price.
B00BXKOMT6|4.0|There's a lot to recommend about Anthony Ryan's Blood Song. In most respects it's a traditional fantasy novel that respects the genre's conventions, but's it's well-written and engaging and it has an interesting perspective that gives it a little bit of an edge and sets it apart from most works of this kind.<br /><br />Even if the early part of the book seems to be fairly standard plotting, there's an underlying unease about the situation then that keeps you involved. This is as it should be since the \\"blood song\\" of the title is indeed a guiding sense of warning that keeps the young Vaelin Al Sorna alive throughout the difficult years of his training as a warrior in the service of the Sixth Order, defenders of the Faith and the United Realm of King Janus. The first part of the book then goes through the standard template of apprenticeship, the honing of Vaelin's skills through tests and bonding with fellow warriors, but in addition to being well told, you do get a sense of other elements of the wider problems in and beyond the Realm that will undoubtedly come into play once we get to the world outside.<br /><br />Even that seems fairly familiar territory, with war being on the horizon and conflict not only with foreign states, but also with Deniers of the Faith and from mysterious agencies that use the power of the Dark, Vaelin seeming to play a part in a Destiny that has been foretold in ancient books. It doesn't take too long however to recognise that it's not all peace, love and goodness under the rule of King Janus, that the expected divisions between the forces of Good and Evil aren't that clear and that Vaelin - known now as Hope Killer - might not even be on the side of Right.<br /><br />It's this kind of touch that makes all the difference. How often do we really get to see and understand the working of the \\"forces of darkness\\" from an insider's perspective? It's the way that it's told however that really counts, Anthony Ryan building up credible characterisation that takes into account the usual motivations of greed and ambition but also how fear, personality, power and the weight of history have a part to play in the shaping of Destiny. It's not just all about some ancient prophesy then, or the wielding of mysterious powers, but Blood Song becomes a question over how much power we have over our own destiny. And that's interesting.
1476733953|5.0|Words cannot fully express the extent to which I enjoyed this book! I was sucked in from the first paragraph and it held me thoroughly all the way through its considerable length. I do enjoy an author who is not afraid to kill off a few characters, and this author definitely held the ability to surprise me at some of the twists and turns.<br /><br />I fell completely for the characters in this book and really look forward to starting Dust to find out what happens next. I would not even hesitate to recommend this excellent saga to anyone else. Thoroughly entertaining, brilliantly thought out and written with a flair that I don't find that often these days.<br /><br />Delighted to have stumbled across this author and I wish him all the best for the future!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I had heard so many opinions about this book on the Internet that my enjoyment of Ms Harris previous Sookie books that I wanted to read it my self and form my own opinion.  I did not enjoy it at all, it was a fast read which is about all I can say positive about it.  Ms Harris appeared to be in a big rush to free herself from this series, yes she tied up some story arcs but they seemed all very unimportant to me.  I suppose I can not blame her for wanting a new departure after all she was living with Sookie and friends for a long time and just did not have any more to give to the series.  Unfortunately, it is not tied up into a nice package for me.  Sorry Ms Harris but I won't speak for others but you let me down.  I feel very much the same about the Harper Connelly series.  I felt very much like Ms Harris just could not muster up the energy to continue both series.  I hope that Ms Hamilton will not take Anita over the edge as well.
B00241YHMU|5.0|5star movie .my family and I have enjoyed this movie several times.its one of our go to movies .when we can't get outside.d.l.

B00005O3VC|5.0|I liked the sword fighting. One knight kept cutting off the other knight's arms et legs. It was super funny et everyone here laughed et laughed. It is funny every time you watch it.
B009O2XY12|5.0|enjoyable game - able to win alot without buying more lives or bubbles - and you get more lives quicker than other games
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I never read the book, although I always meant to.  Great movie!  I could watch it again, and that says alot.  Thought provoking, but not in a mind numbing way.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|Rescuing Roby the robot was attempted on my Samsung Galaxy tab 2 as well as on the original Kindle Fire and I am pleased to share with Amazon community that this game is cute and entertaining to play. There is no rush, there is no timers pure simple puzzle solving game-play based on laws of physics. The graphics quality is very good and so are the characters. The game-play even-though seems simple but quite challenging at times. After few trial and errors you can get the robot into it's crate and move on to the next level. The music is appropriate for the game but you can also turn it off and keep only the sound effects on. Overall for less than a dollar it is a worthy puzzle game to have.<br /><br />Recommended!
B003D0E3FM|5.0|This movie was made in 1957, so I expected it to be a bit hokey.  Quite a surprise, it was very good.  Worth a watch, the music is the only hokey part.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is awesome plus if your bored and you can play it with a friend you can play it anywhere you don't have to have internet go play it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a great series.  The ending was a surprise, but good.  Thank you Suzanne Collins for the gift of getting lost in a good book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not so easy it's boring and not so hard it's frustrating. Good placement of clues. Not bad for a free app.

B00CTXBO9M|5.0|If you just need ways to pass the time for your children or even for you, buy this game. This game even gives more themes than advertised. Perfect for long car rides.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|I guess I should give it five stars but the villain was just a little too nutty to believe. IK who expects reality from a Bond movie. Great action scenes and good dialog. This crop of Bond Girls is pretty lovely too.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is one of three weather apps I have on my Kindle but the first one I go to when a storm starts brewing in our part of the world. I like the radar best of the three.

0240815807|4.0|It's a great book for those who run a project studio. The chapter about monitoring could be boring, the author thought the same, but it's basic to understand the next chapters.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is the album fans have been DYING for!! Queensryche is back with a vengeance!!  The band has reclaimed their sound and unleashed their BRILLIANCE once again!! THANK YOU QUEENSRYCHE!!!

B0063M22QO|4.0|Easy to play, great game!  Would recommend to anyone who loves puzzle games!  Has different levels and games to keep you entertained for hours
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've grown up playing card games like this. I love this app.<br />I actually originally purchased this as a iPhone app. When I saw<br />The MobilityWare was the maker of this app for my kindle fire,<br />I felt safe with my downloading of this app.
B0064W67IM|5.0|As I have read some of the later volumes, I really appreciated this prelude. Very nice panels, drawings and interesting storyline.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is a great game and highly addictive. Most of all its lots and lots of fun.<br />I highly recommend this game. Great for people who like the &#34;jewel&#34; games.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Great app for kids and adults. This app is a great time waster before you know it you will have spent hours on it. Most realistic hair app out there.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|A typical Ken Follett story. Well researched, highly believable and easy reading. Just the thing to take on holiday, as long as your holiday is not too long..
B006LSZECO|3.0|worth reading but nothing special; I expected the book to be much better than it was after reading the reviews
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love this game. I have been playing it for two weeks. During that time I have had 2 problems that customer services has never seen and are being researched (quests that are done but no credit given). Just when you get everyone healed you are given 5 more sickoos. There is no way to heal these people (I make medicine all day) without using real money. If these people die you lose morale. I can only imagine how frustrating this game is for those not able to constantly be on it doing all the missions (10) minimum working at a time. I wanted a game, NOT A GAME JOB. I'll give it a couple days and then if it doesn't improve I will delete it. Can't someone make a game that is fun without making it a JOB????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? UPDATE: I went back to my game and had 2 MORE SICK PEOPLE (7 in 24hours) AFTER 10 MINUTES BEING OFF GAME!!!!!!!!!!!! DELETED GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|From Black Sabbath to Van Halen to Alice in Chains, the number of bands that have successfully replaced an iconic singer is a who's who list of rock's elite. Queensrÿche hope to join that distinguished group with new vocalist Todd La Torre and if their latest self-titled release is any indication, they are well on their way.<br /><br />Making his recording debut for Queensrÿche in place of former singer Geoff Tate, La Torre captures the operatic vocal style and emotion that made the Seattle quintet one of the most distinct metal acts of the 1980s and 1990s. La Torre delivers a dynamic vocal performance not heard on a Queensrÿche album since 1994's Promised Land.<br /><br />The 11 tracks on Queensrÿche's self-titled record revisit the guitar-driven sound of 1988's Operation: Mindcrime and 1990's Empire, but also keep one foot firmly grounded in modern hard rock and heavy metal style. The result is a record that makes Queensrÿche sound relevant and vibrant for arguably the first time in decades.<br /><br />Back are the harmonized, aggressive guitar solos, huge choruses and memorable vocal melodies. Scott Rockenfield hits the drums like he's 20 years old again, notably in \\"Spore,\\" a tune that harkens back to the Rage for Order era of the band with its progressive time changes. Not to be outdone, Michael Wilton comes out swinging with a slate of headbanging guitar riffs, particularly in \\"Redemption\\" and \\"Vindication.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't Look Back\\" features soaring power metal wails by La Torre, while \\"Open Road\\" and \\"A World Without\\" showcase the singer's gut wrenching and cathartic delivery. Now also Queensrÿche's primary lyricist, La Torre draws inspiration from personal experiences and observations of the band's ugly split with Tate. The lyrics are thought-provoking and show an equal amount of angst and reflection that do justice to the group's legacy.<br /><br />Not to be overlooked are the contributions of bassist Eddie Jackson and guitarist Parker Lundgren. Lundgren wrote most of \\"Where Dreams Go to Die,\\" a riveting four-minute ride. Jackson shows he's got more to offer than just a bass groove, co-writing music and lyrics for the ballad \\"In This Light,\\" and the uptempo \\"Fallout.\\"<br /><br />While there's a lot to like in Queensrÿche's latest offering, the short running time of the album's standard edition is a little disappointing. Clocking in at just over 35 minutes, it's sure to be a point of debate for fans that grew up listening to music during the CD era of much longer recordings and attention spans.<br /><br />The length aside, Queensrÿche's self-titled album sits far ahead of the band's output since the mid-1990s and compares favorably with its most popular and seminal works. If you left Queensrÿche for dead in recent years, this record is the resurrection you've been waiting for from one of the forefathers of progressive hard rock and metal.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I always love these and cant wait for more! they really keep you on your toes and thinking!<br />will play others like it too!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you like zombie films. You should really enjoy this. A great tv series. My wife and I are buying all the seasons.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is a Christmas present for my granddaughter. I am starting a Disney movie collection for her. We all love Disney movies and was so glad to find it at Amazon for her.

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|This show could easily have lasted another 10 years.  Love this show.  Watch it and you'll understand.  No more words.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|After a few listens of the online stream of the new Queensryche self-titled album the week before its release, I was all prepared to give it a respectable four-star rating as a respectable return to form by a band that hadn't put out even a halfway decent album since the Clinton administration. I rarely give five stars on Amazon, since that implies perfection, and there's very little that's perfect in this world.<br /><br />Something funny happened on the way to that four-star review, however. Every listen brings something new and a bigger smile to my face, and I can't get these damned songs out of my head. There isn't a single weak moment on this album. You know what that means? Five stars. Yep, I'm going all the way with this one.<br /><br />This is the return of the Queensryche music that I knew and loved so very much in the '80s and early '90s. I'd almost forgotten how much this band meant to me as a young man. It's back. They're back.<br /><br />Geoff Tate is not missed a bit by this listener. Not just because his voice and attitude went south years ago, but because his replacement is awesome. The fact is that Todd LaTorre is a great singer in his own right. If he were in any other band besides Queensryche, the metal community would be pissing its collective pants in awe at how good this guy is. He's stepped into the most difficult singing gig in metal and nailed it. Not just his voice, but his writing skills and obvious love for this music shine through. He might not have quite the smoothness in his voice or ridiculous level of control that Tate had in his twenties, but Todd brings more versatility and an aggression that sits very well in the heavier end of the Queensryche style, which Tate never had. And he's only going to get better in the years ahead.<br /><br />Yeah, Queensryche 2013 is short even by LP standards. Yeah, it sounds like it was mastered by a deaf guy (a smear on the beautiful production job by James Barton). Forget all that. These songs and performances are easily up to par with the best of Queensryche's past. If you love Queensryche, you'll love this album. Buy it!
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This movie of Hansel and Gretel is great.  It's a total new look to the fairy tale of witches and children.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There are multiple levels, so that keeps the game itself going, but each level is relatively quick, which is good when you have a very short time to play something.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I love Nora's book and this was no exception.  This one had a few twists & turns and you could see the characters in your mind.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|beautifully written; wonderful story; couldn't put it down; highly recommended; a story of family relationships, a story of poverty and war, and a story of the place of women in some societies
B004J4XGN6|5.0|I only wish I could have read this book 5 years ago as I was starting my business. We could have saved so much money and been so much further ahead.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined with you is the third installment of the Crossfire series. At the start of this installment we find Eva has found out that Gideon killed Nathan in order to protect her and she  is conflicted about her feelings about everything that happened. She was forced to leave Gideon and go back to her own home because the police are still watching them and she doesn't want them to know that she has gone to Gideon to find out if he really did kill Nathan.<br /> Eva desperately wants to be with Gideon, but she is not sure what Gideon's motivation was for doing what he did and if he even wants anything to do with her anymore.<br />I was very conflicted on how I felt about this book I was so excited when I was coming out and I really wanted to like it, and for the most part I liked the storyline, but the problem was there wasn't much of a storyline. Things really didn't get started until two thirds through the book. Don't get me wrong I love a hot steamy book but there comes a point when I'm like, \\"seriously!\\" It really  became too much and I kept wondering when were we going to get some sort of storyline, some actual forward motion.  I know this was originally supposed to be the final book in the trilogy but was somehow extended out for three additional books and so I feel like this was made into a filler book instead of an actual book because we really didn't get anything of substance, and then there were all these extra crazy storylines that were added like \\"The Italian Mafia\\",  disappearances of random people, and incidental pregnancy of characters that didn't necessarily need to be storylines that are now storylines because they have extra books coming out. Does that make sense? I have to say I'm a huge fan of Sylvia Day and the Crossfire Series, however this book left me very disappointed and wanting a whole lot more. I felt like this story dragged and there was no forward motion of the plot until the end of the book really. I also felt that the ending of this bookjust really stopped mid scene and in a really awkward moment. I kept flipping Pages thinking is this really where it's going end? It really wasn't even a cliffhanger moment, it was just the middle of a scene, and was kind of an odd place.<br />Like I said I'm a huge Fan of the Sylvia Day and of the Crossfire Series and Yes I had high expectations for this book, But this went way beyond disappointment from my higher expectations and I really felt like this was just a filler book until she could get to the next book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my daughter loves it! it can be a little complicated young from tab to tab but over all its a good game.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a cool puzzle game. Didn't want to to end. Cannot wait till there are more levels. You must get this game. I'm telling you it's really fun. A puzzle game involving a box and its fun.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|I'm not going to go into full detail of each song but in short, all I can say is WOW!!!! This is the comeback album of Rock N Roll history!!!! Every song on this album reminds me of the days when Queensryche could do no wrong. The dual guitars are back, the pounding drums, the thumping bass and a singer who has easily filled the deep shoes left by the ouster of Geoff Tate. I have been a die hard fan of Queensryche since 1986. Every album was epic up until Hear In The Now Frontier. It seemed like each album afterwards with the exception of American Soldier was a decline. I stood behind the band through thick and thin but more and more people were leaving or didn't even know they were still around. Tate basically hired his family and friends and everything had to be done his way. The rest of the band decided enough is enough and I assure you it was the RYCHE decision to dismiss Tate. Now whats left of the Queensryche fan base can enjoy everything that made us fans in the first place. This album will certainly gain many new Queensryche fans as well as bring back many of the people who left throughout the years. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and go buy this album, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. GREAT JOB Scott, Whip, Eddie, Parker, and of course our new frontman Todd!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome the only thing that I don't like is the realms you cant make a realms server or nothing I hope you can fix that bescause me and my friends love Mcpherson and we want to play even when we at home so plz fix
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|have one problem it takes ages to get the stars to work<br />other wise its a great game  keeps the brain alert.

0345803485|1.0|How much can a middle aged British wife learn about BDSM after happening across BDSM porn one day on the internet? This book is the fruit of that discovery and someone happening across a just as poorly written blog.<br /><br />Her BDSM fantasies would have been better kept for the weekly date night fantasies with her husband than being put on paper.<br /><br />Utterly dreadful.

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I never have watched anything more than once - at least on purpose - but I'm glad I ordered this collection to watch during this summer void of TV shows.  This series has some great writers which apparently abandoned all their jobs at any studio after this show ended.  While it definitely leans toward the left thinking population, many of the events and situations are timeless and non-partisan.  Makes you want to send a copy to every legislator in the US.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Nabbed me from the start!  The story line was an emotional roller coaster and well worth the ride. The characters are well developed and believable. I didn't want it to end.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It has been a long time since an author has made me cry within the first few pages of their book. Neil's way of describing people, places and things has always made his stories come alive for me. If you have enjoyed his other works in the past, you won't be disappointed.
B000I8HIR2|2.0|Waste of money and time.  This movie is too long and doesn't make sense if you are not familiar with the game version.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It has been years since I read a John Grisham book -- the last being The Partner because I just didn't think they were as good as the earlier books.  Picked this one up based on good reviews.  I will say it kept me interested, a few twist and turns.  It doesn't bother me that much of it is implausible -- I think that can make certain books fun.  My issue in only giving a 3 vs. a better rating is that while the characters are interesting they are not all the likeable to me, and I wasn't too into the revenge factor with this one.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Preview was so much better than the movie. The movie was slow and not scary at all. They ruined it by showing &#34;mama&#34; who was ridiculous.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I love this series! Martin does a great job of building the story lines and characters cant wait to read the rest of the books
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Funny light romantic comedy. I love the character \\"Emma\\" the actress did a superb job.  If only the series did not end.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragons Story is a well executed app by design, guaranteed to engage both those who are looking to not spend any money, and those who are willing to drop some dough to alleviate their impatience. The art is extremely varied, the game mechanics are strong, and the draw to return regularly is there, if you enjoy this type of game. Be aware, this is a game intended to play out over the course of many months, with daily input on the order of 10 min - 1 hour.<br /><br />Note: The Kindle versions of this game do need updating to make this game more stable. As I understand it, this patch has been released on Android platforms, but is awaiting approval from Amazon before release. I have not removed any stars due to this being on Amazon.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I was alreay a big QOTSA fan, but this one is about as good as thier self titled album. Even my 10 year-old kid who thinks my taste in music sucks, likes it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Unlike the other reviewers, i happened to think this game was very hard to the point where YouTube was my best friend at times. It is fun to figure out how to get out of these mysterious rooms and let me tell you, the people who created this game need hi fives because it was very creative and if any of you are ever in situations like<br /> these... i do apologize. But seriously, buy this game and sit and think and figure out if you can escape!!!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|Overall, this has been a good buy. With a GoPro, this stabilization (combined with a little bit of Final Cut Pro X stabilization) makes a flawless video in any case. The trouble is combining things. DSLR, audio recorder, LED light, and monopod all together and this product loses it's stabilizing effect, and turns into a great video mount. It's also hard to zoom and focus while keeping it still.<br /><br />Best uses: small cameras in motion<br />Also: video mount with attachments
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is quite interesting,but it would be better if the items were easier to find. For example, the vet clinic didn't appear until it became a goal and two of my animals had already died.  Would be a better  if the player could rotate the position of the buildings. It would make the appear more realistic.
B00355L2TU|4.0|I love this quick workout. It's about 20 minutes long, so it can be fit into any schedule, and, I believe that the most people should be able to do the exercises as none are very strenuous on the body and joints. That does not mean that everyone is going to get through the whole workout the first time. Believe me, I did not , but after a week straight, I was able to.<br />I also like the workout because it only requires you and a pair of hand weights.<br />I have seen an overall improvement in my body in 2 weeks, doing this workout everyday, but 2, but must say, my inner thighs look great!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Bring on part 3..I didn't want this to end. I enjoy Ken's style of story telling..it draws you in and takes you for the ride. It was easy to picture this story in my mind. Love it! Love it! Love it!..Thank you Ken Follett...  :)
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The way it was written made you never want to put it down even my gt had a hard time pulling me away from it so I would sneak out on my back patio and read it late at night
0988178532|4.0|First off, let me say that I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to start reading Outview. The premise was interesting and I enjoy thrillers. This one was on a list of books recommended because of other books I'd read, so I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Right out of the gate I was pretty hooked on the character of Nate. Telling the story from his perspective is perfect. I won't give anything away here, but you really get to know, and like, Nate.<br /><br />Every so often, the New Age mysticism angle came off incredibly preachy and, honestly, a bit over the top. If this is Sci-Fi - let's keep it that way. If this is a Gaia-centered dogma piece designed to show us how we're injuring the Earth... it gets to be a bit much at times. That's the only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5. But - even with that one caveat - I loved reading this book. Considering how much I get a little nauseated by the Gaia story and human evil being the primary source of all destruction threatening, well, everything, the fact that I can look past it and enjoy the story is a tribute to the writer.<br /><br />If you see this as a Fantasy novel set in the modern day where certain people tap into powers and strength they never realized they had, you will thoroughly enjoy this. If you try too hard to ground this in a modern-day reality, you may find your credulity stretched too thin and find it difficult to suspend disbelief enough to really enjoy the book. So, go into it knowing this is a Sci-Fi/Fantasy Adventure novel and you will have a blast.<br /><br />Legg makes his characters believable and grounded. Nate and his group of friends are fun to get to know. Looking forward to reading Outin.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|The mixture of her voice and his guitar is incredible. Great job on the Al Kooper classic&#34; Love you more than you'll ever know&#34;
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I stumbled across her music on YouTube. I had just seen a skit by Key and Peele on Dubstep, which I hadn't heard of before so I started looking up Dubstep music. I have to admit that I didn't really find Dubstep music to my particular liking; however, Lindsey Stirling has done a wonderful job combining her violin playing with upbeat sounds. I suggest checking out her videos on YouTube, as well.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|same with this one i watched them all for ireland didnt have any problems playing them in the ps3 lol
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|My wife is Swedish and we watched the Swedish versions before they made this one. I really liked the originals and was worried that Hollywood would Americanize this film too much, losing a lot of the story. I have to say though that I was pleasantly surprised by this version. It is very similar to the Swedish versions, and Daniel Craig does an amazing job in it. This is one of the few American films that does its foreign counterpart justice.
B001XCWPAM|5.0|didnt get a chance to watch this one yet. but i suppose its going to be the same as the other ones

B0000074FL|3.0|Ah, the Renegade album. Snowy White entering the band for 1980's Chinatown made for a good fit and the record had an overall rocking feel. Songs that just didn't let up in energy at all. It was an underrated album for sure. But the follow up finds the band trying to recapture that with mixed results. Renegade is almost universally panned as the bands creative nadir. There might be some truth to that, but it's still a decent album with some worthwhile songs on it. Starting out with Angel Of Death, it's a minor fan favorite but has only become one with time. It opens with keyboards...obviously at that point people were probably thinking \\"keyboards on a Thin Lizzy album??\\"...they were supposed to be the greatest guitar band ever. Most critics probably based their entire review of the record based on that alone. But the guitar takes over the song and the synths are really only there for background ambiance. The lyrics are obviously ripped off from Sympathy For The Devil but the riff is still pretty good and heavy so what was the problem here?<br /><br />The title track finds the band in subdued mood. Going for another mini epic, the tune 6 minutes in length is obviously about misunderstood youth, it actually sounds a bit like Dire Straits. It's a nice song, has a mellow feel overall but it does have some good heavy riffs here and there. Like Chinatown, the production here is polished but where as that album found a good balance, Renegade's sound goes a little too far. It does sound a little too clean. The Pressure Will Blow brings the more straight ahead rock back albeit with some underpinning keyboard work, but the guitar work is okay as well. Snowy White just doesn't sound as dedicated here and wasn't a good fit for the band. Leave This Town for the first time finally finds the band locking into a solid rock groove, fast paced and Phil sounds inspired here, its a highlight for 80's Lizzy no doubt. No One Told Him has another okay riff, with a more pop sound to it. Nowonto other territory...Fats. This track has some odd jazz influenced playing going on thats lyrically a tribute to Fats Domino. It's okay, but it's not very memorable and also follows the more subdued nature that neuters a lot of this album. Mexican Blood continues the diversity, adding obvious spanish guitar influences. The main riff is pretty good and this one works a lot better than Fats. These attempts at different styles probably scared away a lot of the bands fans at the time but it was apparent Phil was trying to introduce outside elements into the Lizzy sound. But was it really that big a surprise? If you listened to his 2 solo albums, the first of which Solo In Soho was recorded and released right during the Chinatown/Renegade era, you'll find even more diverse songs than on this album. So Phil really wasn't just a hard rocker but the bands brand was just that, and 30 some odd years later it's easy to see this in perspective but at the time a typical fan hearing the powerhouse rock style the band pioneered didn't want to hear Mexican Blood and Fats. It's Getting Dangerous returns to the usual fast tempo rock but the song has yet another subdued feel to it thematically. It's a minor highlight. The best song here is easily Hollywood (Down On Your Luck). It actually reminds you of the Lizzy of old with a pretty good inspired rocking riff and an overall fun driving feel that is infectious and will have you singing along. It was obviously chosen as the single.<br /><br />Renegade definitely suffers from uninspired playing and ideas. Yeah Phil and Scott were heavy into drug use here but still, Snowy White doesn't add very much and it was clear he wasn't right for the band at all. He exited soon after of course. Leaving the final album Thunder And Lightning to be done with John Sykes and would find them re energized with their best set of songs in a few years. Renegade isn't a terrible album by any means and although it does have some fans who do defend it, if you have any worries about picking it up, dont. The songs are all pretty good while they're on they just dont feature their best set of riffs. Time has actually been kind to it.
125000098X|4.0|Generally like all this author's offeerings. Only problem was the difficlulty in following the English colloquy and usage of idioms that made it somewht difficult to follow.  Storyline was great, though.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|it is fun and creative<br />also it is one of the games where you get a lot for your money
B0050KEVO6|5.0|the only thing i would change here is that there would be background music and you could get points by combining things to get hints
1623360277|5.0|It started with Forks over Knives, and reading the China Study. My wife and I have spent the last year slowly modifying our diets. I still had lingering questions...how bad is oil? Can I eat lots of bread? What about salt and alcohol? Reading The Starch Solution has been extremely informative and has helped us make more of the changes that will insure a lifetime of excellent health. This book is readable even by those without a scientific background. Dr. McDougall, thank you for your pioneering work and the significant contributions you've made to clarifying exactly what a healthy diet consists of.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It is great for an alarm clock, it just should have more capabilities and stuff like more clock designs and stuff.
0765325950|4.0|This writer always delights my son so I sent it to him for a surprise &#34;package in the mail&#34; sort of thing.  He really loved it and is a loyal, and avid Robert Jordan fan. I asked what he thought about this particular book and his enthusiasm was delightful but he didn't specify any particular thing. He has been reading this series since the first one was a new release and I know I'll send him more as they come along.
B007N85POS|5.0|this game is as fun as minecraft or burn the city and it can get really addicting. the only thing that i would change is that you would be able to gain points to buy things in a virtual store, not with real money.
B005QMOZOO|4.0|Charming, exciting, clever, funny and hard to put down. A lovely novel that will be remembered for its charming characters. Quite a believable plot.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|this game is as fun as the original angry birds game. still addicting and sometimes annoying and frustrating. still very fun, though
159463176X|2.0|I really felt like this novel paled in comparison to Hosseini's other two books, both of which i read without putting down as they were that compelling and emotionally engaging.  this one started off promising, and i did become invested in the relationship between pari and abdullah.  however, it quickly devolves into a hard-to-follow jumble of stories, and i found myself trying to remember who everyone was and how it was all connected.  i really felt like i was missing something, but kept reading in the hopes that something at the end would tie everything together.  unfortunaltey i was very disappointed.  the ending was lackluster, and left me wishing that he would have at least ended with the same narrator he started with, abdullah.  overall, some of the writing is beautiful, as i have come to expect from this author.  however the fragmented nature of the story, and the unnecessary sections about characters i had little to no interest in and felt they did little to advance the plot or give greater background to other characters, made me come away feeling confused and underwhelmed.  i was so looking forward to this book, i am sad to say it did not live up to his previous efforts.
B0097K21YW|5.0|This game is great in the way that it is similar to angry birds games and that it is all about trajectory and things like that.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I liked it a lot and it was very interesting movie even though I do not like this kind of movie. I enjoyed it a lot
B002XHNMVM|5.0|This book has to be read by every person around the world. I am waiting to read a new one of Ken.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Wonderful tribute to the Bond series. The contrast between the beauty of the cinematography and the darkness of the events parallels Bond's impeccable charisma and style and the terrible tasks he does for his country. Looking forward to 50 more years of Bond.
B001VU1NJ0|5.0|This is a  great movies that has a lot of twists to it that keeps you on your toes. Great acting as well.

B0091REZMW|5.0|good hidden object game. if you like hidden object games give it a try.  I'm addicted to them so I love it
B009NG1Q96|4.0|Enjoyed this book and can't wait for the last one. It was nice to read a good book that was also clean and not full of obscenities and sex scenes.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|great game for girls or boys.  hey, boys like to whack that hair down to nothing too!  although I have noticed that all the boys in my family have (after the thrill of having bald models was over!) left the models with lots of long curly hair!  The girls like to experiment with the colors, lengths, curls, etc.  great fun for the &#34;tween&#34; girls!
B0012QVJXS|3.0|I once thought the Superman movie was pretty good -- and maybe it's just been a few too many years from the time I originally saw the movie -- but now, it's a bit dated and corny. The films starts out well enough, but soon degrades into a silly love story between the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and Lois Lane.  Oh well, just call me &#34;jaded&#34;!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you use ebay, you may well benefit from this app.  It sends notifications to your smartphone about auction status, and alerts you if you have sold or won an item.  You can check on payments made, and do many things you would usually do from a desktop or laptop computer.  Necessary tool if you're an ebayer.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read Hopeless by Colleen Hoover, and enjoyed her writing so much that I decided to continue with her other books. Slammed is a must-read. I do not want to ruin any of the details for those of you who do choose to read it, but make sure you don't make any plans if you do, because you will not be able to put the book down!
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I'm not sure I ever would have thought of Michael Connelly as a short story author. There's something about his books that almost seems to demand a long-form narrative: the rich environmental details, the willingness to follow the often slow pace that police investigations really take, the gift for exploring his characters - all of these things seem to point toward novel length tales. And yet, this trio of short pieces are generally solid pieces of work, even if they don't quite come to life as well as his novels do. One part of that, I think, is their lack of contemporary setting; one of the things that makes Connelly's books so remarkable is the way they almost always seem to reflect their times, and these short stories feel more disposable, less anchored in time. That doesn't make the tales any less involving or the crime stories any less engaging, however. Whether it's a look at how the police investigate a possible suicide, a long-closed case that continues to haunt Harry Bosch, or a look at a clever way through an interrogation that's going nowhere, each of the stories is still involving and well-told, to say nothing of the way they all have that feeling of inside knowledge and awareness of how police work really unfolds. Suicide Run isn't going to be on the top of my Connelly list, but it's still enjoyable work from the great crime author, and it's a good way to spend a few hours, especially if you're just wanting a quick fix from one of the essential modern crime authors.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Very good character development and plot. Seemed to really ramble with characters thoughts a little too much. I found myself skipping over parts just to get to the end. Storyline would have flowed much better and would have been a smoother read if a bit more editing had been done.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|We just watched this as a family, and we all laughed and laughed - me, my husband, and our 3- and 4-year-old boys alike. I've honestly never seen them laugh so much at any movie. That being said, there's a lot of slapstick humor with the Minions hitting, launching, and generally hurting each other. Not ten minutes after this movie was over, my 4-year-old chose to try some of those \\"jokes\\" out on his brother. I was suddenly less amused. But if your kids are a little older and better at separating movies from real life, it's a hoot, and I recommend it.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|This was a great movie. It kept your attention all the way threw and left you wanting more. I can't wait for the second one to come out. I just got the books to start reading
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Gangster Squad doesn't feel like it's inspired by true events. It feels like a predictable, Hollywood gangster yarn. Good performances help make it entertaining.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Really love this app I use it everyday now I can't even sleep without it. It helps me relax .
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|Hoffman and Williams never let you down.  Children liked the music, monologue and action scenes.  As well as the the thought that there is always a child inside each one of us.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My kids and I had a great time together solving this great game. We can't wait for the next room!
B008D36INE|2.0|Lost by title, The movie dragged a long, The characters were boring, They did not evoke interest. There were no plot.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|There are ever increasing 3D movies out there, and this one which first showed in theaters back in 2001 or so does not hang with the current crop.  Still, if you can get it for less than 12$, it isn't a bad addition, it just won't be featured movie when you want to show off the power of 3D
0345529057|5.0|Can't wait for HBO's 10 show series once a year - What an addictive story.  This book set is perfect.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is so fun I have been waiting for a game kind of like clue it works really good and is a great time waster
B00CWY76CC|4.0|the game is ok. one of the better ones. I okay a level or two before bed. so far I have no issues with it.
B009CWWFD2|2.0|Reads like an unfinished book, worst Archer ever and I've read them all.  He's usually so gifted in his storytelling.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|Chocolat is a movie that wrestles with some themes most central to the human condition, such as &#34;sin&#34; vs. goodness, freedom, attachments, and tradition. It inspires the viewer to contemplate some powerful truths in very beautiful ways.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|I am only 25% of the way into this book but I knew in the first chapter it is a tour de force of newly revised WWI scholarship.  Clark simply takes us to a whole new level of understanding, challenging conventional wisdom--especially the one-dimensional analysis of German motivations, intentions and responsibility in the lead up to WWI at the turn of the last century.  The Balkan analysis also provides a colorful education and deep background that is useful in light of the more recent dissolution of Yugoslavia and the development of Serbian political culture.  Exceedingly well written and easy to read, while never skimping on the complexity of this dramatic inflection point of world history.  Perhaps I will find some flaws as I continue the book, but nothing yet.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This collection of pure auditory pleasure is well worth the price. I can listen to this collection over and over and over and over without it getting old. RIP Freddie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not able to put the book down.  Very captivating. I just kept picking up the book to find out what was happening. Definitely a good read.
1596680199|5.0|This was a gift and really looks like it will be helpful.  It was well appreciated and has plenty of good ideas.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I recommend it to everyone I know. You don't need to be a dog lover or an animal lover to love this story.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana's voice is lush and her arrangements are superb.  A singer knows, it's all in the delivery, and Diana can really deliver the lyrics with passion.
0553386794|5.0|This book started out slow for me. I had a hard time getting into it. I kept at it, and when the many characters and scenes began making sense to me, I couldn't put the book down. Despite my early misgivings, this turned out to be one of the best books I've ever read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really great little app! Interesting challenge without being unsolvable. Hope I don`t finish it for a while.  Nice not to be solicited to purchase something every five minutes.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I gave this 5 stars because I liked the movie a lot. But, it's not a documentary. It's based on a true story, which means that there are some thing in it that are true and some that are a fabrication of Hollywood.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love Angry birds friends as I can play it both on my kindle and facebook with my friends and also there a different challanges each week.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Fun flick for a night at home or a girls night. Great backstory on the wizard and how he came to Oz.
B00742BVW8|5.0|This is a great story, with great actors. The cinematography was amazing. I believe it was nominated for an Academy award for the cinematography.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show was very interesting, and I couldn't stop watching it! It kept me at the edge of my seat.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I find this show a great escape. Good characters and depicts the world on the stage and all the associated drama as well as the hard work put in by the talented professionals in the field.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|After﻿ Earth. All I can say about this movie is that an experiment in giving your spoiled stupid no talented kid a movie to star in. Will and Jaden performs SUCKED. Could going down as the worst movie ever made, All thanks to Will Smith. Thank God, I saw this movie for free and didn't pay to see it. Now I want my 100 mins back, what a waste of﻿ time and film. When will Hollywood learn not to cast Jaden in any movie. After Earth is an Epic bomb and a failure.
014312336X|4.0|This book covers a time period and long forgotten Peking.  It reveals a great deal about SAVING FACE, but it's not about Chinese doing that, rather foreign legations in China.  The book is well researched and written and the subject is fascinating.  It had a compelling start, but I thought it too heavy on details midway thru (the unofficial murder investigation) but it hums to a fine finish and one is so glad to know the story and value its' telling. The modern Beijing still has a number of surviving hutongs.  You'll want to go visit the Fox Tower scene once you've finished the book. BRAVO Paul French.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this, it's not to easy and not to hard also at first I thought it was like 100 floors but its not you get a whole room to explore, there is only levels 1-8 so I think there will be more levels to come, overall its a great fun game.
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Saw his performance on SNL and it seemed to be pretty good so I thought, what the heck.... I will give the Yeezus a shot.<br />However, I bought this and was very disappointed.<br /><br />Its like Kanye has a hard time rhyming or something. Well, more specifically writing good rhymes.<br />There are some of the worst lyrics ever 'rapped'. Nothing original, nothing anyone could really support.<br />More typical crap we heard a million times from every rapper. B*tches, clubs, drinking...<br />Arent you getting married soon, and now have a daughter Kanye??<br />Are you really eating Asian girls in a sexual way (better Amazon?)-(\\"Im in it\\" reference)<br />And I think to sum it up, listen to the \\"Im in it\\" song. This shows how 'great' Kanye really is. WEAK LYRICS, WEAK MUSIC.<br /><br />I wish I would have never bought this, or supported Kanye in any kind of way.<br /><br />From now on when I think of Kanye, I think \\"chach\\"!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|I love the genre, but this book just didn't work for me. It felt very disjointed and as soon as I started to care about the story or a character, the narrator moved on to a new interview. It took me several months to force myself to finish the book.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I've always been a fan of survival movies, and this is in a different league altogether.<br /><br />The dream like atmosphere, which brings out the element of fiction in a remarkable way.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|This is a good ap, but hard to set up.  I have to do it at least 5 times before it finally worked.  I would put in my locations, and then they would go away or go back to something that I didn't want there.  Now that it is set up it works great.
B00007E8O5|5.0|Great double CD.  Apparently, this is the whole set of music Jerry Cantrell wanted to release but record company wouldn't release a double CD, therefore, \\"Degradation Trip\\" the shortened version of the double CD was first released.  This is not the first CD of D/T with the new songs tacked on at the end, this is the order in which J/C originally wanted this released.  Excellent riffs and great vocals by Cantrell.  Songs seem to be reflective of things that happened in his life, how he sees things on numerous topics, and all are assured to keep your undivided attention.  A variety of different types of Rock N Roll, hard, medium, and soft.  Many songs are in a storytelling format.  If you're an Alice in  Chains fan, you'll also love this CD by Cantrell.  Many songs could pass for AIC.  I'm thrilled with double CD even though I had the first single CD already.  Purchased at Amazon because this CD is from  2002(?) and I couldn't find it in the stores once I found out there was a double CD.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is somewhat like Temple Run. I like it and play it very often. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because everything you can buy with the fake currency is overpriced. Other than that the app is great.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|You have no idea how useful the extra 8 buttons are. As an avid league player (and shoutcaster / coach / mentor / streamer), as well as general FPS/RTS PC gamer in general, the extra buttons are the difference between having a good gaming experience and having a GREAT gaming experience. Sure, Razer does try to improve on their gaming accessories, but the Nostromo doesn't even bother to stack up with the G13. With the highest level of support from both the games themselves and the Logitech people (they release profiles for games so you can always stay up-to-date and optimized with the latest and greatest recommended layouts), you really can't lose with this product.<br /><br />The Nostromo has some flaws to it, mainly lying in the actual design implementation and button layouts. The buttons are too far apart, your wrists are crooked in a weird way, and not having an LCD with stuff on it can be frustrating for those who don't have the money to fork out for a Razer Blade.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-- Cheaper than the Nostromo<br />-- LCD screen bonus, with programmability and customizability based on desktop app<br />-- Constant updates (~1 per month)<br />-- Internal storage for button layouts (32MB -- more than enough for all of your fav. games)<br />-- Easy swapping between layouts for specific characters / playstyles (3 layouts available per profile)<br />-- On-the-fly programming with on-screen prompts and feedback based on overlapping keys / macros, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-- Doesn't make toast<br />-- Doesn't guarantee a win - just makes you a better player.<br /><br />By comparison, the Nostromo doesn't have an LCD screen, has most of the Razer support dropped due to low numbers of traction, and doesn't hold the macros if you unplug it from one computer and plug it into another.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really enjoyed it! Not sure about some of the colors but I figured it out!  Great game looking forward to the other levels...
0061353248|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to think, or likes to think they know everything!<br />The reason I say this is because this book takes the traditional viewpoint of behavioural economics and turns it on its head. The weirdest things ever - and the most irrational decisions humans can make, are in this book. Without spoiling anything, just think of it this way (as said in the preface of the book itself): Humans are irrational creatures, but not only that, we're PREDICTABLY so. We follow patterns for patterns sake, regardless of what common sense or logic dictates. That's what makes humans so brilliant, yet so stupid!<br /><br />It explains cheating, dishonesty, and other &#34;undesirable&#34; behaviour in all aspects too, so hats off to explaining inner tendencies of humans that most people don't want to touch on. I'm very glad I picked up this book. As a computer scientist, logician, and polymath, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants a different and more intriguing outlook on human behaviour.
B003QSMC18|5.0|I love this movie. Took me a few times watching, then I was hooked. The music is so fun and the characters are eccentric. Makes you  wish New Orleans could go back in time.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Simply put, Tate can't sing anymore. LaTorre can. Tate tried to ruin the band. He wanted to branch out and pretty much flip off heavy metal. He should have done that with solo work. It is clear the guys in Queesnryche (LaTorre version) know what fans want and are still able to deliver. This is an amazing album without tarnishing the Queensryche legacy. I will go so far as to say it ranks as their third best behind Rage for Order(1) and Operation:Mindcrime (2). Yes, this is better than Empire and destroys Promised Land and everything after.  The guitars scream, Rockenfeld's drums are a bit high in the mix but his playing is his best in over a decade. And sorry Geoff but LaTorre is the guy now. A great find by your old band mates. Other than the intro, there is not a bad song on the thing. The album far exceeds my expectations and it might even be the best album of the year so far. Welcome back guys and DO NOT bring Tate back.

B00DAXYNEI|5.0|Kevin Spacey is well cast and superb in this character.  One or two &#34;slow&#34; episodes, but for the most part this show is compelling entertainment that leaves you wishing for more.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|First of all, let me start by saying that I found the game was put together extremely well.  The graphics, sounds, storyline, etc, were amazing.  Instead of you, the detective, searching for a missing child in a spooky amusement park, you must search for her mother.  I found this to be a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />I give the overall quality of this game 5 stars.<br /><br />There is, however, one disappointment for me.  Before I explain my disappointment, please understand that I ALWAYS thoroughly check into the price of games.  It seemed to me that I checked every nook and cranny to find out how much the full version would cost me before downloading.  Most times when reviewers complain about being mislead, it irritates me because usually in the game description, it will tell you that you can purchase digital content in this app with real money, which indicates that if you downloaded the free version you will have to pay to continue on.  That didn't happen here.  Therefore, it appears this was truly a misleading situation, and was disappointing to find you need to pay 4.99 to continue.<br /><br />That being said, I wouldn't mind paying that much for this game, I just would've like to have been informed ahead of time.  As indicated earlier, this game was put together well, and when I can afford to pay for the full version, I will.<br /><br />G5 developers, please put the free AND paid icons in the game store, so consumers are well-defined. I think it wouldn't scare away your customers.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|I've always enjoyed thrillers and this is a great one. The climax is quite unexpected and it keeps you guessing.<br />I would highly recommend reading it.<br />John Grishan is one of my favourite authors and this book has all the right ingredients to make it a difficult one to put down till you reach the end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. it has been challenging, but level nine seems to freeze when you click on the cabinet next to the guitar. The game then jumps scenes to the pink chair and stops. Nothing then works and I have to exit out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't wait for new levels!  Fast and challenging but not so hard that you need hints.  Definitely a good buy!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Very engrossing story, extremely well written.  Good characters and even better action.  Hope there is a sequel and that it is out soon.
0345803493|3.0|Not sour grapes, although it may seem like it.<br /><br />I have been writing BDSM stories for years and years but never thought they were marketable to the general public. Perhaps mine are not, because they are actually REALISTIC, whereas these books ... not so much. If someone is truly into that lifestyle they are not going to be the pushover that Mr. Grey is, so easily and so quickly. I found his &#34;issues&#34; to be lacking. They were also laid out way too easily, no real struggles or covering up occurred as would in real life.<br /><br />There was no suspense here; for example when Grey's helicopter goes down, we had about 3 pages of him missing, equaling to about 5 hours of time. Not really enough to get worked up over at all.<br /><br />Generally this series is lacking in a lot of elements. However, something must be right for a bestseller status and I admire the fact that E.L. elevated the idea of &#34;kinky f***ery&#34; and taken it out of the closet and into the collective consciousness of our society.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Want more rooms. Not too hard but a Lot of fun for kids as well as adults.  Want to see more.

B000U6BT40|4.0|Funny and quirky first episode of Eureka. Unexpected events, funny dialogue and a nice set in beautiful surroundings. Sometimes the acting is a little overdone, but that might improve in future episodes.
B007U1FEJE|4.0|It's amazing to see the contortions people are putting themselves through, picking through meaningless minutiae, as they overanalyze this wonderful album. This is the Beach Boys, for pete's sake; it's not that complicated. I have nearly 10 hours of their music on iTunes and the simple fact is, when the whole lot is played randomly on shuffle, these new songs mix in seamlessly and harmoniously with the rest. Each is as enjoyable as (or, in some cases, more enjoyable than) much of the group's previous work. Highly recommended.
B00005AAFS|4.0|I am not usually one for gothic or metal rock but this album is excellent. Great production, great instrumental, and he has a great voice although I don't know german. I have to say I am loving listening to this, great in the car too. Well done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that I can choose my favorite version, but it is a little cumbersome to me when I am accustomed to just flipping to the verses I want to read.  It is always available to look up something or just read it.
1623420148|5.0|I read about five books a week and let me tell this was not only the best book I read the week I read it was the best book I've read in the last three months. Hands down already see this boom being in my top five for the year and were only halfway through. The main character is cocky, conceived, full of himself and feels like he's god gift to women. And he'll be one of your favorite book boyfriends for the rest of your life j don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it but I will say that it's a character you that you find horrible yet you find yourself attracted to him. He tells it like is from a man's pointing view and that is refreshing. I found myself laughing out loud, more than once. Be prepared to make a fool if yourself while you read this book. I only hope that you love it as much as I did.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Terrific book. Lends some humanity to German pilots who fought with a measure of dignity and respect for their opponents (their term) about which I knew almost nothing. However, to pick on a fine point, in a book in which the author uses language beautifully, he uses dove for the past tense of dive. He also refers to a radio man who preferred his tubes and transistors. I don't think they existed in the same radio.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I love this movie. Considering the emotion wrapped into the first half and no one really talks, wow! Just wow!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I just watched this movie and it was soooooooo cute.  I laughed and cried. My little one is about to turn one and we are ttc again. It reminded me of all the joys and nightmares of pregna and trying to get pregnant. The actors were great.
B00005JNS0|1.0|My son LOVES this movie, so much that he wore out the previous DVD. Went on Amazon to get a replacement. Purchased from the default seller which I didn't even notice was not Amazon.<br /><br />I was suspicious when the DVD came with a note that basically said to contact the seller if I had a problem, implying that I should not contact Amazon.<br />The reasons I believe the DVD is a fake:<br /> - No white security strip on the packaging<br /> - Case feels flimsy compared to most DVDs<br /> - Code to register DVD did not work, said it had already been used<br /> - The printing on the packaging and the DVD itself all seems slightly off, not as crisp as you would expect.<br /> - The code on the inner circle of the DVD says \\"CARS D9-A\\", real Disney DVDs have a 6-digit code and more, confirmed by comparing to our worn out copy.<br /><br />Amazon refunded me, I will use that money to make sure I purchase from Amazon.com directly.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Awesome best game ever. I have over twenty games by far the the best one, better yet it's free. Best game ever.
B005LAIISU|5.0|I live this movie, great sound and picture. It is as good as the others before. And very funny like the others
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Another wonderful book from this author!!!!  His books not only have a great story, but also you learn a lot about how life is like in the Middle East...
B00932A4XE|2.0|I didn't watch this, but my wife thought it was ok. I can only guess that I would not have been entertained.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Secret Daughter is well written. The book gives a person insight into two different cultures and countries.  It also gives important detail about the lives of different cultures and how they differ due to different beliefs.  I enjoyed the book very much, it was hard to put down.  I wished the two families could have met, but maybe the Author thought best for this ending.  A great read for book clubs.
0385349947|3.0|It was a decent read. Considering what I was expecting with all the RAVE reviews and hype that surrounded the book's launch, it was more of pleasant conversation than feminist anthem. I like Sandberg's message that women are not a monolithic group and must claim their own power. In the end I was left wondering why she wrote the book- was it just a right of passage in her own success or a mission to inspire and empower women in new ways? If the latter, the book is a BIG disappointment!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|GOOD STREAMING. NO problems. Good movie to watch. I would recommend this one to all who ask me about it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Beautifully written.  A love story like no other. Our book club had one of its best discussions. Stirred many opinions and effected everyone differently.  Jojo Moyes is an author with a great future.
0062255657|4.0|Just finished The Ocean at the End of the Lane, and for boundless stretches of time throughout the day I have been submerging and resurfacing in the slippery lagoon between reality and fiction--often I would open my eyes into my sunlit bedroom and wonder if this was truly the real world.<br /><br />While at first I was hesitant about the narrative voice Gaiman chose to use in this novel, the seven-year-old protagonist was portrayed to the letter; unexpectedly simple coming from Gaiman's commanding Sandman and emotional Tristan from Stardust. And yet, by chapter four I found myself enraptured and enslaved by this wonderful book. I simply could not put it down for fear that the narrative would change, that a page would mysteriously go missing--for that was how frail the boundary between reality and fantasy became.<br /><br />The narrative reads much like a combination of Charles de Lint's \\"Forests of the Heart\\" with the poetic flightiness of Terry Windlings's \\"The Wood Wife\\". I find that this novel is a unique addition to Gaiman's wide repertoire of work; falling into place with the unifying theme of the proximity between the magical world and the human world and the delicate balance that keeps them apart.<br /><br />At its core, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, is a novel about the probable impossible; the utter truth that nothing is truly beyond belief. It is a novel of selfless sacrifice, both from Lettie Hempstock and our seven-year-old nameless narrator. It is a story of fear and the courage it takes to overcome your nightmares in order to discover your true worth. It is a novel that makes you think twice about the innocence of a child (as the opening quotation so adequately points out); and makes you realize that children are merely little adults who can reason, argue, and sacrifice to the same degree we (adults) can. Children can even be wiser than adults, as the narrator points out:<br /><br />\\"Adults follow paths. Children explore. Adults are content to walk the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurred to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath the rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.\\" (56)<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any reader who wants to be moved by a narrative without a moving narrator. It is difficult to describe the way the narrator undergoes conflict and yet remains oblivious to his internal transformations (if a result of magic or confining, unimaginative maturity is up to the reader). But what is certain is that Gaiman's novel will change you, the reader.<br /><br />\\"A story matters, I suspect, to the extend that the people in the story change. But I was seven when all of these things happened, and I was the same person at the end of it that I was at he beginning, wasn't I? (170)the same way, hundreds of times, or thousands; perhaps it never occurred to adults to step off the paths, to creep beneath the rhododendrons, to find the spaces between fences.\\" (56)<br /><br />I would recommend this book to any reader who wants to be moved by a narrative without a moving narrator.

B0060MYK7G|5.0|I thought it was one of the best productions ever made for TV. Really disappointed that it wasn't continued! :(
B003EV6DBM|5.0|I love all of the Doctor Who episodes.  I am a late comer to the experience (Christopher) but I have all the most recent episodes and specials available so far.  Keep them coming!
1936608898|5.0|This book has changed the way I look at food, think about food, cook food and shop for food.  I am healthier, happier and I know I will live longer.  Thank you!
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Forced, predictable, and, at times, silly. Dialogue is stiff and grows increasingly absurd. Steer clear if you like complex and believable characters. Oh, and endings.<br /><br />UPDATED 09/20/13: Finally remembered to come back and update this entry. For some reason, Amazon did not post my review when I initially posted it at 3 stars but instantly posted it when I gave it 5 stars, despite that the text was exactly the same. I have upgraded to 4 stars, since reading several other novels since then and realizing it's a far better read than most, but far from perfect.
0380807343|5.0|I read this book last year, even though I'm well over the age of it's target audience, but I loved it. It's delightfully creepy and intriguing with a protagonist that you want to root for. She's able to figure out things on her own and learn from her mistakes. It's a great book for readers of any age.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great acting, real headlines and the reality that not all politicians are bad people.  We were able to get a glimpse of how necessary and yet flawed our political system is and will always be, even when we try to fix it.
0312853254|5.0|As a close follower of ANYTHING Ender Wiggin, I quickly read Speaker for the Dead right after I finished Ender's Game. It's much different than Ender's Game and a much more adult story than I was expecting. That doesn't make it any less incredible. It's a great story that appeals to my inner anthropology geek.<br /><br />-Kris Noel<br />[[ASIN:098269718X Lionhead (Volume 1)]]<br />[[ASIN:1625530064 The Serenity Compound]]
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|the only good part was the Korean girl scenes.  The rest quite boring. The part on the island with Halle Berry being this modern woman was useless.<br />I've put it in twice and still haven't made it all the way thru without falling asleep.<br />Glad I bought this on sale.
