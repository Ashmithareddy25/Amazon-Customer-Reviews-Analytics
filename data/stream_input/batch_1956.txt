B0086700CM|5.0|I loved this app it was very fun and there is a secret to it too get the app and try to figure it out
B005VPRETE|5.0|Very well made and fun to put together.  Lego brand toys are still the standard for building sets for all ages.
B005XLN97M|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old daughter for xmas and she absolutely loves it even my twins that are 4 keep playing with it
B0084AZXKK|5.0|What can I say about this &#34;classic&#34; that has not been said before. This is a must read for all.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary and I was a bit shocked that such things are going on in America.  The natural gas wells that have already been drilled in the U.S. will contribute to the literal firestorm that is coming on this country.  After Christ returns an angel will blow his trumpet and some of the world will be destroyed by fire.  Maybe the U.S. will be;  only God knows.  We need to get ready for Christ's return or our names will not be written in the Lamb's book of life and we will be thrown into the lake of fire.  Christ is King!  Josh Fox does take Christ's name in vain in this documentary, so be warned.
1612680011|5.0|Great stories, interesting and educational. Been hooked on rich dad books ever since. Thanks Rich dad series for all your help.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was absolutly great. I could not put it down, fast read and kept you wanting more. The ups and downs between Abby and Travis was awesome and kept you intrigued as to what would happen next. THe book left me wanting more and I cannot wait until Walking Disaster comes out.
B008YI91HS|5.0|After hearing her brother boast of this movie, my youngest daughter has now become of the age that she could watch it.<br />And she was on the edge of her seat the whole time. This is the best dinosaur movie ever!<br />My family love, love loves Jurassic Park!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love this game. It is so challenging and makes you think. I find myself playing this every chance I get
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very well written story about some difficult topics. The writer brings this story to full circle about a boy and a girl, a man and a woman and their search for love, peace and hope.
B004JHYRDQ|5.0|Asimov sets up a basic detective story but delivers his philosophy and message to humanity in a subtle and well written closing. Can't wait to read robot dreams!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is an amazing writer! This book kept me on the edge of my seat.<br />I simply couldn't put it down
B0096BIENY|5.0|They just keep getting better and better. Even the songs from other albums are even better. I could listen to this all the time.
B008476HBM|5.0|I found Pride and Prejudice to be captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed examining the many rules of etiquette from that period and marveled at the established social boundaries, comparing then and now.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie is amazing and the DVD came as if it was bought from a store brand new. No problems at all :)
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Sometimes the history gets stuck describing too many details about the cat's life and details that doesn't make any sense. But I understand that she is not a writer,she is a victim. The editorial didn't help the book at all
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Enjoyed this flick with grandma, grandpa, wifey and my boys. Total Action Out the Proverbial Wazoo!!!  Needed a single malt to take off the movie induced tension - good stuff!
0375869026|5.0|I read this book in a day- on the bus, in my lunch break, every spare second I got until it was finished.  I literally couldn't put it down and when it was over I felt bereft.<br /><br />I cried almost the whole way through- especially the horrible moment on Halloween, and through Via's struggle as she tries to balance her desire to fit in and be normal with her intense love and need to protect Auggie.<br /><br />Auggie is a truly lovable character, funny, believable and sweet.  His naivety is just enough to make his home-school background believable without making him shallow or silly. You really feel like you are walking with him as he slinks through the school corridors, cringing with him as an unsuspecting student or teacher sees his face for the first time, and pretends not to notice.  He's very self-aware, understanding all the details that make people treat him differently right down to the way he has to eat (\\"like a tortoise\\") and yet still faces each day with outstanding courage and humour that I don't think I could show.<br /><br />Whilst this in some ways is an immensely sad book highlighting some of the prejudices children like Auggie face (one mother photoshops his face out of the school picture and circulates the edited version.  Auggie shrugs it off), it's also an uplifting story.  Auggie might be \\"ugly\\" on the outside, but he has the love and support of a wonderful family, which some of the crueler, more attractive kids don't have.  It also expresses how, no matter how strange you look on the outside, inner beauty and bravery can overcome it and win the respect of everyone who matters.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Game play was very smooth and fluid. There's tons of deck and game play options. I've uninstalled this game, however, because of intrusive video advertising. There needs to be controls that set what type of advertising is allowed. I play games like solitaire to pass the time, often in quiet situations and do not enjoy the mad scramble to turn obnoxious videos off.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This may be subjective but this little thing allows you to pump up the music higher without having the music sound like noise. For $19, this is well worth it for me. My only complaint is that you can't charge while playing, as you get interference noise.<br /><br />**added 1/9/13<br />When used with iPhone5, it makes intermittent interference noises. Not compatible apparently. So now I'm using it with my PC and iPhone4 at home. Not a deal breaker for its price.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is amazing and the DVD came as if it was bought from a store brand new. No problems at all :)
B005LAII08|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I love the music, the story and all the characters. This is one of my son's favorite Disney movies too. I think it's one of the best new Disney princesses yet!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Bought this for my Grand daughter and she was delighted and loves every minute of it and it came quite fast was really surprised.
B009LHFYNG|5.0|This is by far the most comprehensive neuroscience textbook, fantastic to review the basics and beyond. Well written and keeps to its promise of linking cellular and molecular processes as the brickstones for the mind.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|Hard to control on Kindle Fire HD.  Cube goes in a direction other than the one you're moving to, which causes me to fall off the edge.  Makes the game very frustrating to play.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Ignore the bad reviews on this case. People are so whiny. This functions perfectly fine, and is light. It's durable and affordable too.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|These movies were a bought after Christmas, and I am very pleased to say that they arrived very fast.  Great service!
140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom's style of writing is unique, easy to read, and keeps  wanting to keep on reading the book , whether you have the time then or not.  This book had good incites to living, changes that can be made for the better in one's life; looking for the best in people.  A very intriguing book.
0345803485|5.0|Great book, read all three! Where is Christian Grey is all I have to say LOL, I read it over the weekend.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read. Started reading and couldn't put it down. Surprises up until the very end. Amazing.
B005KPDAN4|1.0|While the show is good, the streaming is not adequate.  It pauses and buffers routinely and I have a 50Mb/s connection downstream in Charlotte, NC.  Netflix, Hulu on my PC and my Apple TV stream flawlessly.
B00846REIS|5.0|I absolutely love this book! The characters are amazing. I've read it twice and plan on reading it a million times more!!!!!!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I received this movie very quickly.  It was in good order as it was described.  I already watched the movie and it was good.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the graphics. Very good picture. Also step by step instructions are very informative. Enjoying the game very much.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Bourne Legacy was one of the best Borne movies in my opinion.  First movie I have rented from Amazon and it was very easy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I love this game so addictive. I can't stop playing it I play it everyday and I can't wait for what happens next.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game, but can be addicting.  I enjoy trying to go as fast as I can to see how many puzzles I can solve in a minute.  It keeps my brain going.
B006RXQ3GO|5.0|Best movie ever. I love the actors and the jokes in the movie are hilarious. It is like a modern fairy tale love story.
B005LAII6C|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from ParaNorman. You have  boy who sees and speaks to dead people. His older sister is the typical older sister who is embarrassed by her brother's oddities. He's picked on at school and pretty much a loner until one kid decides to friend him.<br />The movie progresses through a story in which the boy has to save his town and along the way convinces people he's not crazy or imaginative.<br />Overall, the movie was good and I got some laughs out of it. The humor isn't so highbrow that kids (mine are 12 and 14) won't get it. It's definitely a movie I'd buy again.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Was not as exciting as the first book, but it was still good. I  still would recommend this book to a friend.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Adults and children alike will like this newest installment of Ice Age!  It is fun and has a new twist on the series with fresh talent.  The overall message of family unity stays consistent with the previous installments, which this mom can appreciate.
B001BANK32|5.0|By far one of the best Stephen king books. This is a great book to read if.you are new to the author
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. It is really a life changing read. It offers insight into religion and the difference between faith and worship.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! THIS AUTHOR WILL FLOOR YOU WITH HER WORDS... What a roller coaster!!! Thank you so much for your books Colleen!! You are truly an amazing author!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the challenge of connecting the dots.  Sometimes it's not the route you expect but the challenge is there for all ages to enjoy!
B0002BO05S|5.0|Max Von Sydow gives an excellent portrayal of Jesus Christ. One of the better movies made and well worth watching.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this after I lost the original charger my Kindle Fire (First Generation) came with.  It charges it quickly and the cord is much longer than the original charger.  Highly recommend!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The writers have taken these well known fairy tails to an all new level.  Watching it on netflix and waiting for the next season to be available.
B0081SPK0I|4.0|It's just like the arcade game I remember playing in the 80s.  All it needs is a steering wheel and it would be just like the arcade version.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! THIS AUTHOR WILL FLOOR YOU WITH HER WORDS... What a roller coaster!!! Thank you so much for your books Colleen!! You are truly an amazing author!!!
B000FC146C|5.0|This was a true piece of art.  The best book I have ever read.  A lot better than the mini series.  The mini series did not do it justice.
B000AM6MM8|5.0|A great movie to watch. Set in the Middle Ages, the film portrays life in the time. It's a long movie but worth the time.
886613077X|4.0|So somehow the top 2 reviews on here both say \\"one day per page,\\" when in fact they put 7 days on 2 pages.  Unsure what the deal is here...<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Small, lots of info in the book.  Pocket in the back is very neat for 1-2 normal size cards.  Sturdy cover.  Elastic to keep shut and ribbon to keep place are all nice.  There are many things in the book other than the days such as conversions, common dates, notes section, '13-'14 weekly calendars etc.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />It appears the sizes and reviews of the Moleskine products are mixed up on this site so please read product specs.  This planner literally fits on the palm of my hand, which was smaller than I expected when ordering.  For the price I might have just sprung for something bigger.  Probably won't fit more than 1-3 events on each day, and nothing too detailed, about 1\\" X 3\\" for each day and 1\\" X 1\\" space for Sat/Sun.<br /><br />Just be sure what you're ordering from the company, check the specs.  If you haven't had one of these before maybe even physically mark out on a piece of paper what the dimensions are so you aren't surprised when this arrives.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Great boredom buster when waiting for an appointment or just to help your mind unwind from the day.  Might even hep keep your brain limber.  Strategy required.
1400052181|5.0|I love to learn something new and this book taught me so much about cells, cancer, science, disclosure (or lack of), etc. This is a book that everyone should read, and we should all know who Henrietta Lacks was. Well done.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|too complicated and NO instructions about playingTitle of game UNO.The help guide on my Kindle Fire HD leaves a lot to desire
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Good read for first time erotic fiction, loved all three books with the battle off wills between Grey and Ana
B000A1GXTQ|5.0|An excellent example of Alfred Hitchcock's exprtise as a director. This is one of his earlier films and it is great watching.
B005VOXPAM|5.0|was just what we hoped for.  well made and heavy construction for fun play for 3 year old great buy
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is so fun. The results are always different. There is so many different ways that things turn out
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl was intriguiging. This &#34;who dunnit&#34; was awesome. I would recommend this to anyone who likes screwed up people.:)
B009VSW15Y|3.0|OK I don't understand a camera that only takes pictures of who is holding it.I guess there is a reason.
B008BM9L72|5.0|read all three, good sexual chemestry. Loved the battle of wills with Grey and Ana, but was put off with all the swearing.
B002VJ0576|5.0|One of the better interpretations of the Sherlock Holmes genre. I enjoyed this movie a great deal and recommend it.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Will Smith is always great! loved it! hope they keep making more. I would love that! I gave it 5 stars
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using the Logitech MX518 gaming mouse for a few years now and the mouse is getting a little worn. I figured I would try this mouse from Anker as it promised a ton of features with a low price point. The main reason I was looking forward to this mouse was the 9 programmable buttons which the MX518 does not have.<br />First thing I noticed when I first used the mouse is that it's really light, almost too light. I threw in all the weight tuning cartridges and it still did not weigh as much as the MX518 I'm used to. Not a big issue, but something I will have to get used to.<br />Once I got the software installed, it did not take long for me to learn the in's and out's of configuring the mouse. Anker makes the software really easy to navigate.  No issues there.<br /><br />After using the mouse for about two weeks, I can honestly say it is time to retire the MX518 and move to the Anker.<br />The mouse feels solid and with so many buttons to configure, this is the ideal mouse for gaming.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Configurable DPI, anywhere from 200-8000 DPI!<br />9 buttons to configure as you wish<br />Anker software is easy to use<br />Configurable LED light<br />Braided USB cord<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very light mouse (but adjustable with tuning cartridges)<br />The middle mouse button LED and indicator LEDs do not change color. Only the Anker symbol is configurable.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Such a fun book. It kept my attention. Didn't know what was going to happen next. Loved, loved, loved it.
0345803485|1.0|I wish there was a score below one star. I am not an English native speaker, but English in this book was somewhere in between bad, worse, and the worst. The whole book is a direct offense to the readers who went to school.<br />And the plot? The history will judge writers like this, for telling our teenagers to better look for a rich, handsome, and pilot-pianist-business with Bberry (sic!) male, to graduate without learning how to put a few sentences together (in English), and, at 21, to remain completely clueless about your body (and, mind).<br />I am only writing this review to help prospective readers decide not to read this book. It is depressing to see that so many people liked this book, but, hey, so many people out there also like dog fights, reality shows, and fox news. It is just depressing!
030758836X|1.0|I started to read this book so excited! I thought that this book would be one of my favorites, until it ended. OMG such a frustrating end! We all know that the perfect crime doesn't exist. This \\"Gone girl\\" apparently thought about EVERY detail to screw her husband and suddenly ALL turns to perfection to screw poor Desi. I think that this is the perfect story for a psycho... with such a crappy ending! Don't waste your time reading this!
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Steve Buscemi is great as a 1920s gangster in New Jersey. An HBO series that shows how the gangster world operated back then.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Doesn't give the back-story of Thomas and Trina but a story of two other teens instead. It was a good story, just not what I was expecting.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than Dexter. Never thought I would get this entangled with a serial killer, but he's great
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Enjoyed this, especially  the friendships that developed. The book kept my attention so that I didn't want to quit reading.
B008XG1X18|4.0|they don't mess with layout much, and it crashes some but getting better as it gains popularity. overall one of my favorite apps
B002SAUCBC|4.0|I read reviews on this book and they described the horror of the story, etc.  However, it's certainly not horror on the level of IT or some of King's other works.  I did enjoy it, as I believe any King fan would.  However, don't expect one of his true horror stories.<br /><br />Steve
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This HBO show is a great rendition of life in the gangster world of the 1930's. A show worth watching.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Purchased as gift - my son loves the cd and he also downloaded the mp3.  Packaged arrived on time for the holidays
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A little slow to start with but got better about a third of the way through still liked the story
0671449028|5.0|This book, along with a few other Amazon purchases are my 2 year old's treasures. We have to hide them sometimes, or she'll make you read to her endlessly. I love the way she was quickly captivated.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|the book is pretty interesting. i dont usually like journal styled books but its relly caught my attention and im enjoying cant wait to finish it!
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Loved the movie. Went to halloween horror night which had a house for silent hill. Then had to buy the movie.
0765325950|5.0|Just wait: the kindle version will be sold on online soon via amazon, to the masses. I just got my digital mobi format today time stamp 4PST!
B000I9U9A4|4.0|A movie about a very hard way of life in very harsh conditions. Life isn't always fair, and this movie definitely shows that, however I doubt the conditions on a ship during this time period were as good as depicted in this movie. With that being understood, it WAS a good movie. Russell Crowe was super.
B0086700CM|5.0|Do you have a few seconds to waste while you're on hold? Or maybe in line at the bank?  This is just the game its quick and easy.
0399226907|5.0|My daughter loves the very hungry caterpillar. This definitely played a part in her love for books and reading. The book is durable and colorful. I'd recommend it.
0307454568|5.0|great book and with a lot of action.  i don't want to say to much, but if you liked the movie the girl with the dragon tattoo you are going to love the trilogy.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Just the ending for this fab trilogy.  Did not fail with action, sexual tension and imagination.  Well worth the read of the full set.  Would love to read the set again but from Christian's view like the last few pages...
1452110581|2.0|There are a few laugh-out-loud cat poems in this book, but overall it's not as funny as I expected.  If you want a truly funny cat book, try &#34;How to Tell If Your Cat is Plotting to Kill You.&#34;  Way more entertaining.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I love the superheroes! Even the bad guy ... he did an excellent job. The aliens however, were not even close to being believable. Other than that, I really enjoyed the movie.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|I found the movie to be very predictable. I thought from the previews that this movie would have me on the edge of my seat with all of the action, but this never happened.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very fast moving and hard to put down. Grisham as always, is a great writer.  Had a good ending. Don S
0307949508|5.0|great book and with a lot of action.  i don't want to say to much, but if you liked the movie the girl with the dragon tattoo you are going to love the trilogy.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I waited til after my study to read this and was well worth the wait.  Thought some of the book was very intense and other bits quite slow but well worth the read...bring on the next one
B005FISBV2|5.0|I don't. Have show time so this is how I keep up with the series. And I am never disappointed with Dexter.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|great movie i usually do not watch a movie repeatedly but i did on this one. very suspenceful and always keeps you on the edge. you will never guess the ending
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I definitely recommend picking up this movie.  Especially if your a Seth McFarlan fan.  It was hilarious and I am not afraid to admit I watched it several times over.  Great movie!
0156034565|4.0|&#34;Salmon Fishing  in the Yemenis  a very interesting book.  I wanted to read the book after seeing the movie.<br />It was an enjoyable read.
0307949486|5.0|great book and with a lot of action.  i don't want to say to much, but if you liked the movie the girl with the dragon tattoo you are going to love the trilogy.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Well worth the wait and full of heart stopping action.  Made me blush, laugh and cry well worth the read.  Look forward to the last in the series.
B004HYDM0A|3.0|love the tv show, wanted to see the documentary...was soso.  should have told more about angela and the whole story involved.  didn't make much sense.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I give it a five star because of its cute story of a man and his dog. I just hate that these stories the dog dies...but other than that I really like it.
B004KD5TQI|2.0|I loved \\"Sucker Punch\\"; but this review is not about the film...but the soundtrack. Let me say this, for those of you who dug the way the music complimented the sureal cinimatography and effects of the movie...this is not the case on the disc for your car (or home) stereo.<br /><br />Something is missing. Or maybe added. Forced even. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this item, expecting to be blown away and jamming to some kick'n tunes as I shot down the highway only to be utterly disapointed. I found myself flipping song to song after giving each a minute or so only to find myself continually \\"looking for the good stuff I remember\\"...I hardly found any.<br /><br />At tops, maybe 3-4 tracks were worthy of a ride in the car. I listened to the entire disc at home several times w/o interuption and just felt like the energy that seemed to bleed out of the TV screen while the film was playing was lost with only the music.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. None of these songs are bad. Some are down right beautiful and will have you entranced...but it was not what I was looking for; it was not for me. So if you thought the movie was baddass; and the soundtrack was banging...that it would rock your soundsystem and fuel a nice spirited drive then pick up something else and spare yourself the irritation of trying to find out who to \\"re-gift\\" this lemon to.
B006LSZECO|3.0|&#34;Gone Girl A Novel  I was disappointed by the ending. It was building and building and then it just ended.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|i started this book thinking it was going to be a great holiday read full of lots of gee-whiz stories of drug taking, the 60s, and wild times on the road with the 'keef n mick' show. well it was all these things and a lot more i didn't expect... and i am not even particularly a stones fan: it is well written; keith comes across as both more intelligent and more self-aware than expected; he was open about people he had meet and  his relationships without any sense of dishing dirt or settling scores, he seems to be able to see and balance the good with the bad in relationships he has had; and, and this comes from a non-guitar playing reader, there is a lot of really interesting stuff about music and guitar playing. (my sister's boyfriend was very impressed that i knew what a 'lick' was - thanks keith!) one thing that really stands out is Keith's passion for music. Of course this could just be a good story - i don't care about the money or drugs or sex, its always been about the music - but it comes across as genuine especially as keith doesn't try to hide his appetites for the former.<br /><br />one thing he doesn't cover in any detail is his current marriage, which seems a fair trade for the interesting social history that is the life of Keith Richards. highly recommended for anyone with any interest in popular culture since the 60s.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was really into this novel, and disappointed with the end, although how else could it end? I would (and have) certainly recommend this book .
B00A757EFW|3.0|GAME IS FUN AND BRINGS BACK GOOD MEMORIES BUT IS HARD TO CONTROL MOVEMENT OF PAC-MAN.  HE DOSEN'T ALWAYS GO DIRECTION YOU WANT HIM TO.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|wish there was another book after this one, the last chapter leaves you wanting more. Mr. Grey is taunting with your emotions at the end.
0385344333|3.0|I have lovee reading all the previous Jack Reacher novels. This one was a little slow for my mind. My husband loved it though. I found the story a little too soft. The beginning and the end are the best parts. I'll still buy the next Reacher novel.<br /><br />CB<br /><br />p.s. Why did they choose Tom Cruise to be Reacher??????? He is totally NOT how I picture tall, large Reacher. Hmmmmm
B000007XUQ|5.0|Every year I've heard the Carpenter's Christmas songs on the radio.  I love their Christmas music.  My sister does too so I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my sister.  She was thrilled and played the CD's till early January.  The Carpenters have a wonderful sound and Karen's voice is angelic.  If I could have only one Christmas album this would be it!<br /><br />3 years in a row I've ordered this CD (not just from Amazon) and later got an e-mail telling me it was no longer available. This year I ordered it again expecting to get the same response (not available). Two days later I received it!  I couldn't believe it.  I guess they finally re-released it.  Thanks so much Amazon!<br /><br />This was a Christmas gift for my sister
B00AF6B22E|4.0|Not since American Gangster have I seen a Washington film I found moving in a way I found Flight moving. Do not read on the story and go watch the film like I did and you will guaranteed a very interesting experience. Though Flight is maybe 15 minutes too long, I felt those extra minutes added to it's message about substance abuse. But do not for one moment think this film deals with just that, it deals with a pilot possessed. I am so happy I got to watch it and this is easily one of the best films to have released this year.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Tracey Thorn is new to me, but I am going to watch for her in the future. I like her singing and her music.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put the book down since I started reading. I found my self turning all electronic devices and enjoying reading again. Very romantic with suspense, the way the book is narrated it makes you dream about the place where it happened
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great quality. fast delivery. no issues with iteam. A + + + + + + + + + + +
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I had this DVD but I must have lent it out. I can't live without it, so I had to get another copy. I love this movie-!!
B003K5ZQGU|5.0|Watch this over and over, still love it. Emily Blunt is amazing and perfect for this role. I have never seen the guy before but he was awesome. Learn a little history, make a new favorite movie - two for one.
B005LAIIKI|3.0|This film had some gruesome amazing action, it has some good dialogues, it doesn't have any defining moments like Death Proof or Kill Bill did. I feel Tarantino has changed something over the course of his last two films, I think he has started the subject matter of recreating period a tad too seriously. Foxx is amazing, Waltz is very good too but the film overall felt a little blase in the end because I was expecting to watch the film I waited for all year.<br /><br />Django is not a bad film, it just tries too hard to be good at whatever it is trying to insinuate.  Samuel Jackson was annoying and Leonardo's character truly made me uncomfortable. A lot of talk of black and white which is always a welcome discussion but overall, Django Unchained will probably not be in my top 10 films of the year. Way many better films.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|When I saw that they were regrinding Total Recall I knew that I would not like this movie as Arnold cannot be duplicated especially by Colin Farrell (I thought). Was I ever wrong! This movie is at least as good and in some ways better than the first vehicle. Farrell does a very good job of selling the brainwashed and confused hero and makes you believe that he may never accept who he was. His action scenes are, well, really kickin' Add in Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale and, well, what can I say... you sold me! The CGI is first rate and the story though science fiction is remotely plausible. I did not think Beckinsale could be such a b-tch but she brings it in her fight scenes with her \\"hubby\\". This movie was criticized for no character development... snivel and whine, who cares!? Is this really what action adventure is about? Bring on the firepower and exploding robot parts. This was a wild ride so throw in and enjoy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book I thought was going to be a simple love story. I was definitely wrong. The story is crazy.  The connections that are made throughout the book are great. Holder and sky are perfect for each other.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It's an easy read. sometimes it gets boring. fast delivery. no ther issues. c+ + + + + + +
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game. The hardest part is  waiting for more coins. That takes a lot of time but the game is so fun I can't stop. Recommended for any person who is bored.
1423140605|5.0|Xmas Gift; Good!  The cost vs. in stores was/is great and the book is highly regarded and my son loves it, no complaints = happy kid!
B005LAIH54|5.0|It is much much better than the first movie Clash of the Titans 1st.. I love both movies.. Rooting for Perseus!!!!!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I haven't used my Ultraviolet copy, so I can't comment on that, but I don't get why people are giving the film itself a one-star rating.<br /><br />If you've seen Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and you haven't seen this, do it. It's the perfect ending to the trilogy, and I feel like everything just came together. Yeah, it's slower than The Dark Knight, but it's just building and building to the end, and I promise, it's worth it.<br />As a huge Batman fan, I wasn't disappointed with this(or the whole trilogy). Don't listen to people who say they don't like it because they &#34;couldn't understand Bane.&#34; You'll miss a word or two the first time, but you'll wanna see it again, and the second time, his voice is really clear.<br /><br />Definitely get it, but when you go to watch it, set aside some extra time because I was emotionally drained after every time I watched it.<br />If this doesn't win anything at the Academy Awards, I give up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a good book because there was some romance and also there was some action so that is y I liked the book
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Game is a blast - me, my 12 year old, my little one, my Aunt, parents, neices, everyone loves this game.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Had this app for my Kindle Fire. Once the update came, my Kindle froze and stopped working. Fix this problem!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  It is rather lengthy, but it puts history in perspective.  I would recommend this read!  Enjoy!!
B002ZG977Y|4.0|Learning about Perseus that he had no idea who his real parents were until events came!!! He found out the whole truth about his birth and who he was..  Watch this movie Clash of the Titans first before you watch next movie Wrath of the Titans.. ROOTING FOR PERSEUS (Sam Worthington, Actor)!!!!
B004X60QE2|5.0|Pleased with the video quality and sound.  Had not seen this season, and I do like it.  Subsequent seasons are better in terms of plot and character development, but this is an entertaining dvd and a must for Eurekans.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Some thing to learn might expand your vocabulary<br /><br />This was the first time since I've seen a lot of people who has been a lot nice
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are so many twists and turns that you literally have to continue to read until you are at the end of the book.
B007S3S8HO|1.0|Got this for my five year old grandson.  It was way too difficult for him and they ended up returning it to a store.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book if you want to get back into reading again. It's also great that they have all the books available for the Kindle
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game of strategery so much fun to play. Just be careful it can be addicting and take up a lot of timenin your day
B000ID37KO|5.0|I have seen this movie numerous times and love it!  Scary and clever for the times.  Tippi Hedren is Melanie Griffith's mom and this was her debut movie I think.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really liked the book and most of the ideas presented.  I could have done w/out the more graphic description of the killing/death of the animals.
B008N1V11U|5.0|Batman is a video game about Bane taking over Gothem City and trying to burn it to ashes. This is an Epic game and this game is worth the money paid for it by far! I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did. In the first level you are batman and you battle Bane and loose. He inprisons him and locks you away. Next your Bruce Wayne in casual clothing trying to escape. Then the story gets a whole lot better. Tip! always head for the bat symbol on your mini map that will lead you to your next mission
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show and all the characters - always keeps me interested and I never fall asleep a good gauge as to the quality of the show for me.
B005LAII1C|5.0|The product arrived only a couple days after pre-ordering. Looks great on the TV would pre-order again. . . .
0545265355|5.0|I haven't raced through a series of books so fast since Harry Potter. Buying all three at once enabled me to pick the second book up as soon as I'd finished the first one. Awesome, fast-past stories with a good lesson about the evils of too much power.<br /><br />Only caveat: Don't go in expecting great literature. The Hunger Games can't be (and shouldn't be) compared to the Great Books. Just appreciated for what they are.
B006TVQU6C|4.0|This is a very nice &#34;budget&#34; case. It incorporates many features found in more expensive cases.<br /><br />Pro:<br />  Fan design allows for good airflow.<br />  Tool-less entry and plenty of thumb screws<br />  No sharp edges<br />  plenty of room for a standard desktop computer. Not sure I would do SLI in it.<br />  No Budget PSU with it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  It has none of the features you would find in a computer case 2x the cost.<br />  No budget PSU with it.<br /><br />I liked it enough for the price I bought a 2nd one. For my personal desktop I will still spend a bit more. Then again I am still using a 14 year old solid aluminum Xlaser 3 thermaltake case.
0525478817|5.0|This is a lovely book with a compellingly readable story line, likable, believable, heart-breakingly smart and funny characters and an emotional tug that makes you think more deeply about life and its meaning. What more could anyone want? Perfect for teens but also great for adults.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Memorable yet easy and relaxing to read.The sort of book you pass on without qualms.At the top of its class.
0857680986|5.0|This book is just as informative as it seemed from the other reviews. I recommend it for anyone looking to learn figure drawing in a proper manner, or for anyone who needs to fill in the gaps in their drawing knowledge, and don't have access to a good studio program.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved that I was able to read the book on the Kindle and didn't have to miss a beat between books.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I'm not a &#34;have to have a laugh a minute&#34; guy and I like comedies that build to a good line and have a plot to them, but this was in a league of its own. It seemed like 15-20 mintues would go by with nothing happening. The acting was fantastic as you'd expect, but I was mostly waiting for the ending.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This was recommended by several friends as a funny movie. It did have some funny moments but overall it was a bit boring. It definately wasn't in the same league as &#34;Weekend at Bernie's&#34;.
B000AGTPUU|2.0|I got this movie because we take our daughter to the Polar Express train ride (in Boston, MA area) for two years now, and she loves the experience. The movie clips I saw were very child friendly even though the animated characters are a bit weird... When we started watching the movie we only made it to the point where the boy goes to the top of the train to look for the conductor and the girl.. The scary guy made us turn off the move! This is NOT for a 4 year old for sure!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It lets me now how much battery i have without having to click on top right and going to more options. My kindle is laggy so it helps alot
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this book really compliments the first Fifty Shades of Gray. This was a great twist that I had not expected.
B003X897D2|5.0|Coltrane may be at his best here.  I've only recently begun listening to him, and I can't understand why I waited so long.  His music is the definition of &#34;jazz&#34; as far as I'm concerned.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Like many parents this past Holiday season, I spent a few months trying to track one of these Lego Minecraft sets down for my 11 year old son. I wasn't going to pay the ridiculously inflated prices some 3rd party sellers were trying to get for it. Lego's are already not cheap at their standard retail price, so to multiply that several times over was just too much. There are sites online with alert tools that constantly check the product pages of most of the large online stores to monitor when they come back into stock. Then those sites can set of an alarm on your computer or text message you to let you know the item is in stock. That was about the only way anyone was managing to land on of these this past Christmas. I got lucky and a few days before Christmas one of the stores got them in and I was able to order one. It came one Christmas Eve and it made it under the tree for Christmas morning. My son loves Minecraft and had no idea they even made a Minecraft Lego set. He immediately fell in love with it and despite getting other gifts that cost significantly more, it was by far his favorite.<br /><br />It is a small set, so this is another reason to not pay over inflated prices. If you pay ($$$) for it, you'll probably be disappointed when your box arrives and it's not much larger than a large soup bowl. However this small size doesn't seem to bother the Minecraft fans, and my son was no different. Inside there is an included booklet with directions on how to put the set together, and all the colors of the Lego's match the exact same colors you find in the online game. While it varies on the age of the person putting it together, it takes from 30 minutes to an hour to put it together. Adults could probably do it more quickly. If you can track one of these down at a reasonable price, it will be well loved by the Minecraft fan in your life.
0765325950|1.0|I love this series, I also love ebooks. Quite an unfortunate decision on the part of TOR. Waiting until April is ridiculous for a format that a large portion of people use.
B00992CF6W|3.0|You cant make rollercosters I hats walking.I got so mad when you have a big house. and you have to walk.
0785162348|5.0|As a young 15 year old girl who is completely and utterly obsessed with the 'art of...' books i was excited to finally get this for christmas. When it arrived with 'the art of Captain america: the first avenger' i was pleasantly surprised by it. Firstly, it had a slip-case. A HARDCOVER slipcase. I loved this, soooo much. I normally have to treat these books like glass objects because i'm worried that i'll brake something but i love that it comes with a slipcase.<br />Secondly, it is SO thick. I was expecting a nail thick book with some pretty pictures but this was like the bible thick. I Love it. it's packed full of some really awesome information and i literally have no complaints.<br />So people that are looking to buy it. BUY IT!
B003DDKAT2|4.0|This wasn't as good as the book it's based off but it has brand Pitt who remains a hot god, so it gets four stars.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|Not a bad movie, but it's all been said before.  Characters and plot were predictable, I didn't really like any of them.
B005EVVESM|4.0|I absolutely love Maroon 5. The way that Adam sings is soft and smooth like butter! No better way to say it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoyed this video, it was good quality I just wish it had been included with prime membership, maybe soon it will be.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Warning this game can be addictive. Fun to play if you have a while to play or just a few minutes. I don't play many games and this one is great because it's so easy to fuigure out.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This would be a fun game if you could stay connected to redeem your win. uninstalled from my Games list
B005LAII80|4.0|My review score is based on the set and what you get, not the movie itself. There are other rating places more fitting for that like IMDB though i will say how i feel about the movie later.<br /><br />Of the features, the disk only lists it as 3d. The disk has both the 3d and the 2d versions which is nice. I love to get 3d but hate to watch it with the glasses on every time i want to see it. I was hesitant on buying this but there is a 2d version so have no fear.<br /><br />The 3d in the movie itself wasn't the greatest. My son wasn't sure if it was even 3d at first, though it was. There were no big points where anything jumped out at you. It seemed just to be a 'basic' 3d i guess i would call it. I have seen others use a scale, which measures how far things seem to leap out of the screen. This had depth, not nothing that wowed me. Still it was nice to have some dimension to what we saw and i liked it more than a 2d version.<br /><br />The movie comes with Ultra-Violet which tends to get a bad rap. I have the Flixster app on my ipad so i can stream the movie from anywhere and not use up space which i love. It goes without saying you can stream it from any other internet device like a pc. I personally like it because you can't lose the copy and it's always available. You can even download the movie straight from Flixster onto your device, just like an iTunes copy. The quality of the movie streamed is great and appears to be HD, not SD.<br /><br />It also comes with an iTunes copy is HD also. I bought Avengers and iTunes gave me the SD definition which i wasn't too happy with. This copy looks great, though i will probably never use it as it takes up a lot of space. Its still nice to have. I have to note that the iTunes version also has the special features included in the download.<br /><br />The bonus features are sorely lacking. There are only five features, and each only run for about two minutes. They don't get into much of anything. Because there was so little, i was disappointed, though i usually don't watch special features.<br /><br />A DVD copy would have been nice, but wasn't given. I probably wouldn't use it but maybe lend it out. I think this is why they didn't offer it. It's not a deal breaker.<br /><br />The insert in it is just a leaflet with the code for the digital copy and a cover for the movie. There's no pamphlets or any extras. There is a case cover that's nice.<br /><br />Personally i liked the movie, but not as much as the 90's carnation and i didn't like the color scheme on this one so much. Overall it was a good flick though. Urban did a good job, but was too robotic in his movements, like Robocop. He was trying too hard to be tough, unlike Stallone who was full of energy. It had lots of action and was fairly engrossing throughout. The story was good, and any fan of the old movie or the comics will most likely like it.<br /><br />For the price, its a good set.was disappointed, though i usually don't watch special features.<br /><br />A DVD copy would have been nice, but wasn't given.

B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love the game but some of the screens are very small.  It is often hard to see the figures on the small screens.
B002Q1YDLI|2.0|People's personalities don't change completely.  your great love of shopping doesn't just stop.  Just seemed unbelieveable and dumb.  Worked too hard for a happy ending.
B001ECQ75A|1.0|This disc was described in my player as disc 1 of 3, of the 3D Blu-Ray edition.  NOT the same as the packaging.  It does not play in any version of media player on my computer, as it is &#34;protected content.&#34;  Disappointing and sent back immediately.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Very interesting personal account and demons faced and conquered. I would recommend to any metal fan.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|well made. I thought the graphics were nice and the ease in which I was able to play the game was fantastic.  I did not need the tutorial for this game-but I have played many games like these
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I have had this game for a few years, originally getting this on the Wii, and now on android. The game is pretty fun. The premise is there is a select number of goo balls. You stretch them to make a goo path to an exit, using up goo balls as you go while trying not to using up too many. It gets fairly complicated which makes it fun and makes you think. This is easy enough for children around 10 years old to do and do it well. My daughter who is 7 and isn't good at it, still has fun making a mess of the goo.<br /><br />It isn't a game where you have a screen full on levels where you earn 1-3 stars, which i do not like. It has a map that you travel along on your journey. There are four seasons in the game, which overall takes a full year in the world of goo. There are 48 levels overall which makes it a fairly quick game to bet. There is an under story by a corporation within the world that is the bad guy which the story unravels as you go.<br /><br />For 99 cents, its a good game, though not much replay value. For free, you can't go wrong. Personally, it's not my type of game, but it's still good.
0061353248|3.0|A lesser book than Freakonomics or any of Malcolm Gladwell's books, but Ariely still provides many interesting examples of how we often make decisions in an irrational way.  The author uses this fact to try and encourage legislation to protect us from ourselves.  This is unfortunate.  He then states that we should learn that we do not always make the best decisions for ourselves and that we should be aware of those things that make our decision process hazy.  This is a much more \\"rational\\" conclusion.  It has been many years since I sat in an economics class, but I believe Ariely makes a huge mistake when he states that modern economic theory states people will make rational choices in the marketplace.  My understanding is that people will make the best choices for themselves, based on their view of the cost and benefit.  This is why some people are OK with spending $100 on a pair of sneakers and others think that is foolish.  If your perceived value of owning that pair of sneakers makes the price worth it, then you will buy them.  My wife and I may spend $100 going to the theater and experiencing no buyer's remorse, but our neighbor may believe we were unwise and should have spent $15 going to a movie instead.  This is not a question of rationality but a question of what each of us values.  If the government is brought in to legislate what is a good purchase and what is a bad purchase, we will all be using exorbitant priced solar energy, buying inferior American made cars and eating unhealthy food based on the lobbying-influenced food pyramid.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I'd rank the Kill Order as my favorite book of the series. I loved them all, but the characters in the Kill Order were more endearing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is the perfect game to pass time on long trips or just to relax. It only has one ad in the beginning. No problem  for a wonderful Free Game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|The format, new or old, always works well and is easy on my eyes. It's easy to navigate and always reliable no matter which device I use to access my account. Good job, Yahoo! Keep up the consistency.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|This game is highly addicting! Each session is nicely paced, and it take a lot of strategy to beat each level.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|of course it's a romantic comedy but throw in Baseball, Clint and JT and its very watchable for guys! Except for the part where the Braves get better . . .
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Hey....it's a free app with an option for music upgrade.  Perfect for travel!  Give it a shot...no brainer!<br />Give it try.
1401322786|5.0|This is my second Mitch Albom book.  The first was The five people you meet in heaven.  Loved that one too.  This is a very thought provoking story about time and love.  If I would have had an entire day, I could have finished this book in one sitting.  It took 4 days of reading moderately.  Would highly recommend this book.  Next stop, Tuesdays with Morrie!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|What I like: The game is easy and the quests can be accomplished with peanuts or coins.<br /><br />What I don't like: Most of the quests take some waiting time so when you do that you can do you play another game or leave the device you're using. This is what you would expect in the king of game.<br /><br />Summary: It's fun but take patience. I advise the parents that the game has things you can purchase with money.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Works great. Must have. Every device needs this app. Why would you not choose this one? Works well on my iPhone AND my Kindle Fire.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I hesitated on buying this one because the top review had said the pace was too slow for them. In my opinion, the pace was great. Maybe not as much action as other books out there, but I don't feel that took away from the book at all.<br />Read the preview, see for yourself!
0679729895|5.0|I was notified when it shipped (with tracking info) and it arrived promptly after I had ordered it. Couldn't ask for more! Book was for son, so I can't review it!

B000SGSU58|5.0|Connelly's writings are a real treat to read.  He just keeps upping the bar on every time a new book comes out.
B0091REZMW|4.0|great game!!! its better than other free games I have bought so far it doesn't end. yet there is always something else to do or. look for
B005LAII8K|5.0|To break it down to you, this movie is (Total Recall 2012) meets (In Time 2012) -Justin Timberlake, all in one. This combination of similar ideas makes for a very interesting movie.  A-list actor Bruce Willis gave a very good performance which helps to anchor the movie. This movie was very well made and surprisingly good. The storyline is a new concept, which is produced very well and with a very nice ending. The romance and bedroom scenes are well done; they leave you with just enough to use your imagination without offending anyone. That’s the mark of seasoned producer, and I really appreciate that. The cinematography is stunning. Acting, wardrobe, and props are very good. The CGI effects are to A-list standards, very good. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie, it keeps you on edge and holds your interest all the way through. This is quality entertainment. I recommend purchase on Blue Ray. Thank you.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|was a good movie but the price was to much,could have gone to red box and got it for a buck!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I enjoy playing against random people but have had problems with some people and want to stop the game. cant fig out how 2!! help!<br />a
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it and if David beckon ls reading this I will freak and I love this game too very good for kids
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark and twisted, but oh so hard to put down.  Loved this as much as Gone Girl, the title my book club read, my first novel by Gillian Flynn.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Well, my children liked it, there is some lesson to it too...So I would recommend it to any child! God bless!
B009AMALGM|5.0|This movie is very scary and creepy. The cinematography has improved, acting; sets, props and effects are all very good for this type of movie. The producers have learned a lot and have made improvements. The sound quality it very good. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie. So without giving too much away, overall it's great and I will give it a solid (5) star! However... I still believe that Paranormal (3) is the BEST ever in all the series. They really got it right in that one. As for movie (4), I must say I was also mildly impressed. My hats off to the producers. Well done guys! Maintain the standard of movie (3), and you guys will always hit a home run every time! I highly recommend this movie, so buy on Blue Ray. Thank you.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|very well made movie,kept you wondering what was going to happen next,best one I seen yet...would reccomend to see this one.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Saw it in theater, once or twice at home after, and then decided to buy it for my boyfriend. It's that great.
B00755MHXG|4.0|This book exposed my odd behaviour around people who are different! What a courageous little boy and a wonderful, supportive family! I would recommend this to other readers.
B005LAII80|5.0|I never review movies because I'm very critical about anything and everything that I don't like but I just had to say that this was a GREAT movie.. I don't care for superhero movies but this movie totally blew me away.. The action is almost non stop, the actors did a great job and just because there wasn't a big name movie \\"star\\", did not take away from the movie at all.. I can't believe this movie didn't do well in the theaters but that just shows that people don't really care about the movies but the big names that are associated with them.. Don't have much to say about the 3D since I never cared for it and thought it was a gimmick which is slowly going away.. First time I have ever bought a Blu Ray right after it was released but this movie deserves to be seen in HD..
B009ZQI41C|5.0|I have been reluctant to watch this show for some time, but since I ran out of episodes of Lark Rise to Candleford I decided to give it a chance.  I didn't realize it was set in the early 1900s which is my most favorite period. I am so addicted to this show. I absolutely love it!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|How could this movie not appeal, with so many delightful British actors sharing their talents? If you already know them and love them, then this movie is for you.
1449410243|4.0|This book is fantasticly hilarious. If you have ever seen the antics of the average cat, you will certainly relate to these comics.<br />My only complaint is that many of the comics in the book were used on the Oatmeal's website, so only about half is new material to me. This is the only thing stopping me from rating 5 stars.<br />Given, Inman's offensive style is not for everyone, so be forewarned that there is language and some content may be offensive.<br />It makes a great coffee table book. Guests can't get enough of the hilarity!<br />As a bonus, there is a poster included, which was of little use to me, but is a nice touch nonetheless.<br />If you like funnies and cats, I would definitely recommend this book!
B003MX6QPU|4.0|Clever and great acting by Gordon-Levitt and zany Deschanel.  Not your average 'young love' movie. Entertaining and emotional characters grab your interest immediately.
1451695195|5.0|It's fascinating to me that a neurosurgeon would go beyond the five senses to experience the spiritual! What a great book, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. It's a strong testimony to the fact that we are so much more than what we think we are!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very fun game. I am still playing it all the way through. I' d very much liKe more free games along these lines.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg Allman has created one of the best modern blues albums of lately,interestingly with old blues songs that he makes his own.A bit reserved,but totally emotional blues singer,Gregg has made one of those rare albums that stand up over and over as a testimony to the blues,as such,and as a blues record to enjoy seven days of the week.Please note that the rock-blues mode of the Allman Brothers Band is totally absent - this is a hard-core blues record!
B004478GNI|5.0|I bought this for my nephew for Christmas and he loved it. I helped him put it together and I was really cool when we were done building it. I personally think the Star Wars Legos are really cool and fun to put together, and they make a good gift for any little kid.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Purchased as a gift. The set has 5 discs. I really bought this set for the movies, not the special features as other reviewers have noted. For me, this fits the bill perfectly. The ultraviolet copies were a bonus for me. Packaging is nice. Go Batman!
B003DRWX9I|4.0|This has been on loop in my studio for a couple days now and I have been able to absorb it a bit better. What can you say about Slash, he is just ....well....cool and a very gifted artist. I appreciate what he brings to the table here. I believe his collaborations bring out the best in the vocal artists he works with.  WOW Fergie....who knew? I'd buy an entire album full of this collaboration,  I think this genre' fits her well.<br />Myles is great here as always, he just has such chops There are some real standouts and only one, not so much for me. I am not a Kid Rock fan or really never was gravitated towards Adam Levine's work but those are 2 great pieces here. Ian Astbury kicks some butt, and my idol Chris Cornell, who I speak of with total bias because he is so gifted, has a stand-out to me. Iggy is great and Rocco Deluca's piece is really one of my favorites. Heck Ozzy is even here and gives a solid classical Ozzy piece.<br />I hope Slash continues to do this. I'll buy them as long as they come out. These collaborations give the finished  work such great diversity. To me, this makes an album more enjoyable, interesting, with much more longevity.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I really love this game its cute.,and engaging.the color<br />is bright an fun real nice buy.everyone should play at lest once for pure fun .
B007FH9GA6|3.0|I found this movie harder to follow than the Swedish version. It seemed like a copy of that movie with extra frills for Americans. It was a while after I finished the book so that may have also influenced my ability to track action.  The best thing was that computer entries were in English so I could understand what was on the screens.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Lots of action with Ironman, Thor, Black Widow, the Hulk, etc. Its a great movie if you are into superhero type movies.
0307593525|5.0|Already had one set - this set is for a gift to future son-in-law, an executive chef in Santiago, Chile.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Most of the book is taken up by many vague and totally irrelevant stories relating to events in his life.  The relatively small section describing the shooting of Bin Laden is interesting but doesn't really shed any new facts on the event.<br />Totally regret buying this book.
0765325950|1.0|I have been a fan of the wheel of time since I was in middle school, purchasing every book as soon as they came out. I have since switched to reading all of my books on my Kindle IPad app. What in the world would make TOR make me wait 4 freak'n additional months cuz I don't want to lug around a huge heavy book???? All I have to say is Way to push the limits of lameness :-/
B002PMPTIO|4.0|I wouldn't consider myself a true Trekky, however I did grow up watching the original series, and movies with my dad. This movie did manage to bring back some of the nostalgia of watching the originals for the first time.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a good book for tho see who like romance & action I can't wait to start the next one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great continuation of the story from book one. The ending will leave you wanting more. You will HAVE to read the third one.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep does a great job. We already have one, and bought two more for gifts - in town, and out.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Overal good CG; good action scenes. Would have been better if the original story line was kept -still good SCIFI movie
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|If you love ANIME and CARS this is the perfect movie for you... AWESOME animation, nice plot and GREAT MUSIC :D
0307592731|1.0|I find is so fascinating that she has more sadness about watching her mother's horse die then having an abortion. Its amazing how person can be self involved.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is lots of fun. It 's easy to learn yet not easy to put down. Not recommend for vehicles.
0545265355|5.0|This set is extremely nice. I purchased it as a gift. I already owned the books on my kindle, but bought this set for an 8th grader. When it came in, I was surprised at how nice it looked. The books are hardback and in a very sturdy looking box. Great for someone who may want to re-read the books several times or let others borrow the set.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great book!!  Couldn't put the book down, I even found myself taking little breaks at work to get a little reading in...had to know what was coming next!!  Can't wait for the next one(!!!)
B0067QPVD2|5.0|This also was a gift.  I've seen this movie and found it very entertaining.  Excellent sci-fi.....this was a pre-quel to the older version of The Thing.  It followed the story line and was a interesting ending.
B0076DELIG|3.0|A quick read, not one of his best but entertaining.  I would rate it as a cloudy day on the beach read.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|This narrative went on, and on....and on. The repetition was exceedingly tiresome, and the outcome was predictable. By the end of the book, I didn't much care what happened to anybody. Obviously I would not recommend it.
B005H29GSI|4.0|we still have fun making the pictures on the cards with the blocks and knocking them down.  my 6 year old loved the game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After book two, I needed a little break from this series, so I read a couple other books in-between. When I picked up with this one, it was just as great as the others. Great ending to the love story.
B0073LWEXK|2.0|Seems like I spent more time wonder what I was supposed to do instead of enjoying the game. Perhaps it was the small format.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This movie was one of the funniest dvd I've seen this and last year.  It has a wacky sense of humor.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh.  Good job to all who worked on this movie.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I love this series.  Its my favorite show of all time.  By far.<br />Well worth it.  Cant wait for Season 5.
B002361MLA|5.0|Enlightening, liberating, and insightful.  Requires several reads to comprehend the deep meanings. Could bring peace in your mind. Highly recommended.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|The game is very entertaining...if you want a game that gives you a fight...this tennis game is the one for you! This game works wonderfully with my Kindle Fire HD. Worth the money...most definitely.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Another family Christmas tradition. (Well,<br />at least among the guys).  A must for<br />your 'Holiday' viewing.  Great movie<br />and score.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Easy to use and it does what I need it to do. They want me to write more about it, but I'm not sure what else to say. How about it's easy to use, works flawlessly, and that's enough words to satisfy them.<br /><br />Ta da!
B005LAII80|5.0|Far, far, far better than the Stallone version. This movie restores the anti-hero to what he should be. An excellent flick, with good writing and direction, it knows what it is and it does it well. Everyone should have a copy of this on blu-ray to show off to their friends.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I love this series.  Its my favorite show of all time.  By far.<br />Well worth it.  Cant wait for Season 5.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|He has a way of interpreting music, especially oldies from a bygone era, put a new spin on it, and make the music reach out and grab you.
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love all these movies i think number 5 is the works but its still really good which says alot about the series its a must buy.
B008476HBM|5.0|Its been my favorite book for last 25 years. It is one of the books that keeps feeling new everytime I read it.
B005VT42BS|4.0|Is an excellent tool. It sees every network in the area and gives excellent information about each one. Highly recommended.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|I saw the movie first a couple of years ago and really enjoyed it.  The characters are changed somewhat in the book, but you get a much better idea of how the characters are thinking.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie again so I can compare the two more thoroughly.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all of the work by Preston & Child and been captivated by the Inspector Pendergast caracter in the books. This book answered a lot of questions and put missing pieces of the puzzle together from previous books. This is a fast read and very entertaining, you just have to be careful and not stay up all night,as I did,reading it.<br /><br />If you like action, adventure, mystery, intrigue you will like this book. Preston & Chid have scored again with this book. I would also recommend all the other Preston & Child books and the books they have written independently of each other.
B002UNXSBS|5.0|Benny and Joon<br />thanks for helping us find the movie we wanted..bought it for our granddaughter she loved the film
0140157352|5.0|This was my cheapest text book I have ever boughten in my whole entire college life! ONE PENNY! Great read, I would read it again outside of class.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Very insightful book. Taking a look into someone's life event that is this dramatic was scary. I can not even begin to imagine. God bless
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Easy to see all my emails, easy to send emails with and without pictures. It did not take very long to figure out how to do everything I wanted to do.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I could hardly wait for this to come out.  Some of the music mentioned in the books I was familiar with but some of it was rather obscure.  It added to the enjoyment of the book to hear the music.  If the movies are ever made the sound track should be terrific.
B007704HO6|5.0|This sometimes laugh out loud funny and true life tale of a street performer then vendor of &#34;The Big Issue&#34; magazine is a tale for all cat lovers.  You will absolutely fall in love with Bob, a street smart orange tabby who takes his owner in &#34;Paw&#34; and assists him on his path to recovery from drug addiction.  I loved this story.  It is gritty and true of London streets today and how very often people can simply fall through the cracks of our  society.  I do believe this cat was most instrumental in helping his owner survive and not only prosper but even flourish.  Please read his story.  You will  not be disappointed.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I had a hard time following the story line. Grisham seemed to be jumping all over the place. It may have been because I was reading other material along with it and so I found it difficult to get back into the story. Thank you
B008M87GJK|5.0|I have subscribed to 2 other news sources and am unimpressed for different reasons.  BBC, however is amazing in that it has many stories to choose from, they are easy to see and choose.  Each story is easy to get to and the ap works beautifully without getting hung up or going off on its own.  The stories are long and well done, not brief little overviews.  You can learn as much from the BBC stories as many newspaper stores.  Maybe more.  If I had a complaint, it might be that there is more there to read than I had wished to know.  Try it and see!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Some people gave it horrible reviews but the girl friend and I started watching it with low expectations but were very please by the time we were done watching it. Very funny
B009VSW15Y|4.0|So far I am having fun learning how to take pictures and send them to friends and family.  It does not bother me the camera is one way as it is easy to set up the shots. Appears user friendly.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I own both the original Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" (16GB model) and can confirm that this app will be upside down on the Kindle Fire HD but works fine and is right side up on the original Kindle Fire 7\\". I originally bought the app on my new Kindle Fire HD 3 days ago and was disappointed to see that the home screen and entire game was flipped upside down. No matter what I tried, between redownloading from cloud to turning the device off and on nothing worked. I realized when I bought the app it was checked off for both my Kindle's for download. I then dusted off my original Kindle Fire that I haven't used in over a month since the release of the new HD model and low and behold the app worked perfectly right side up on the original.<br /><br />As for the game it's awesome. For $1.29 I got my money's worth and had some geniune scares. I made it to the 5th letter before I got Slendered...man. I actually like playing on the 7\\" screen because the game's graphics are nothing special although the audio would be better and much creepier with the dolby sound of the HD model.<br /><br />Highly recommended app. 4 out of 5 stars only due to the upside down glitch. Also, I'm not sure if the 7\\" HD model will work as I don't own that version. However, for $1.29 I would take the risk of seeing if it does work on the 7\\" HD model and if it doesn't it's only $1.29 and hopefully they'll fix this issue soon.<br /><br />Update 1/14<br /><br />The app now works perfect on my Kindle Fire HD. Not sure what was done though as I didn't download any patch or update for my Kindle. Either way it looks like they fixed it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I made my Mother cry when she opened it as a present so that pretty much says it all. The book, pictures and music box really add to the quality of this product. I even bought one for myself. Great classic musical and fun to watch again in high def.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|Product gives a nice variety of options. I was impressed with the amount of diverse applications.  One thing I did not find so impressive was the ease of use :/. Knowing my general way around apps,  I found this to be a little.more challenging than I would want. I spent a fair amount of time getting to know the product and then customizing the product for me. I would not recommend this for beginners, as it is a bit complicated. Other than that I would recommend this product as a nice product.
0765325950|1.0|I have been waiting years for this book, but unless the publisher immediately releases to ereaders, I will never buy this book.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Great music, great artist, great cd. I don't buy many cds, but bought this as a Christmas gift and couldn't be happier.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Very satisfied at how quickly I received this item and in great shape.  Unable to locate locally so glad to be able to order it.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I think that there is a place for silliness and humor in movies, but I just grew a bit tired of the rude and crude approach to humor that is characteristic of Seth Macfarlane's offerings. At his best he is a subversive and spot on satirist. At his worst (which is often) he is tiresome and boorish. I do not believe that it takes much cleverness or creativity to produce such a movie. There is not 2 hours of material here that constitutes a movie. Not the best investment of an adult's time.
B0092QITO2|4.0|I ordered it and was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived. The only reason why I dropped a star is that the case was broken due to shipping :( Take the good with the bad. A nice movie that smashes a couple different movies together for an epic adventure. Extended edition was exciting to watch with the added footage.
B005HSL626|5.0|my teen age grand daughte and my grandson that is 4 had a good time playing it,so it is ok for anyone
B007N8RULO|4.0|Great game. Ads only show up inbetween each game, so not too bad for being free. Crashes on the  publisher's loading screen sometimes.
B003MAQM6Q|3.0|I don't know why there was so much noise about this movie, I'm big into movies like this but I thought it was average at best.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It was a great read, the story unique and different, I really enjoyed and could not wait to finish once started.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Maybe it's just the romantic geek in me, but I love this movie! Time travel, worm holes, space time continuum all wrapped up in a dramatic thriller!
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Such an awesome and classic movie for all those Star Wars spoof fans. Shipping was great and quality is great as would be expected with blu ray and it being converted up.
B008ASLNN2|2.0|The quality of the video was very poor. The movie was very entertaining but we did not enjoy as much due to the poor video quality.
B003ASLJS6|4.0|As is typical with Eastwood's magic, this is a very good story about a man being called to something greater than self and, at the right time, stepping up. At bear minimum a good afternoon watch.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|These movies look great! It was cool seeing the additional footage on Aliens. I had never seen it before. Definitely worth the money.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Cd had good packaging. It was a good price for cd. My dad loves it, happy I got it for him.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I first saw/heard Susan Cain speak about introversion on TED.com, [...]. Her 19 minute speech has truly changed my life. Hearing Susan speak about introversion made me realize that there is NOTHING wrong with me NOT wanting to go out on Friday nights or for choosing to sit in all weekend long.. (literally ALL weekend) just be alone. This book really opened my eyes to introversion. I started doing research about introversion and I found out that there are SO many others out there like me and this has helped me to finally feel GOOD about myself. I bought this ebook before she was even done speaking! I stopped reading the book I was reading and started this book. I was actually at work and I decided to take my lunch early and I just stared reading. Not only has Susan's insight opened my mind, it has also helped me to be more outgoing. I realize now that my introversion is not a crutch, but a gift! I make a conscience decisions to be outgoing and speak up more than I ever did before. I can't recommend this book enough!
B005K17RU0|5.0|It is amazing app for kindle fire hd. It is working very well in this version. I recommend it for everyone.
B008GOG98Y|4.0|The video quality was not as good as expected but otherwise the movie was very enjoyable. I had seen this movie about 5 years ago but still enjoyed it.
B000002KHF|4.0|If the current situation of our country would let you believe that white men have no soul...listen to this album and become a believer.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game that fills in spare time. It's challenging and will test your patience if you are desperate to get it out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I was worried with the bad reviews on this game. You don't have too buy every main pony people! But yes you can spend a bunch of money on it. But you don't have too do that stuff. Just play the free way.  Its a lot of fun. Right now I'm at level 15 or 16. forget witch but its a ton of fun! You can get apple bloom and applejack and big macintosh for bit coins! Those are the free stuff you use too buy stuff. At the beginning it will ask you to use a few gems. You have to buy these if you run out so just wait the 30 seconds and it will let you keep the gem! That's a trick I learned. You start with twilight sparkle my favorote pony! hope. this helped.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The Kindle app really came in handy when I opened my Kindle holder to find that the battery was dead! No worries! I simply turned on my phone and started reading on where I'd left off on my Kindle.
1451695195|2.0|I was excited to read this book.  Unfortunately, I am halfway through and I have little to no desire to continue reading.  There is very little about heaven in this book.  What he has written seems a bit far fetched as well.  I have also found that this doctor has some malpractice cases and I am left wondering if he wrote this book for profits.  How is it too that if you do not have a functioning brain and you have a NDE that you would even remember it? I will finish this book to see if my view changes but I am doubtful.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This story reads in a way that keeps you side by side with each moment.  And has an addicting flow that keeps you reading. I really  enjoyed this book. And now I'm going to start book 2!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wonderful exciting nail biter and very arousing with a romantic twist. Couldn't put the book down. Can't wait to read book three
B0060MYM7O|1.0|Seeing this listing for bluray include dvd and digital copies is beyond annoying.  Not only am I not paying extra for things I don't want and will not use,  I have no desire to have enlarged packaging to fit all the extra and unnecessary discs.
B003ZIXO0C|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to this disc.  And the TV screen is showing a warm burning fireplace scene.  It is awesome.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|The  book is amazing. Worth your time. It keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire time. At some point  you are not sure who you are rooting for! The author does an amazing job of blurring the lines.
B000W4E3OS|4.0|For those just starting to discover Scriabin this CD set is a very affordable way to be introduced to the bulk of Scriabin's works (besides solo piano works, Scriabin only made a few orchestral works and a concerto). The pianist here provides a very competent, albeit rather bland reading of most of the works, so if you are looking for a definitive performance you might want to look to Horowitz or Gilels.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|Badly written, verbose, with a dull denouement and too much attention to iphones and other electronics. Maybe they should stop trying to publish two of these things a year. &#34;I am guessing&#34; (to use KS's language) that the editors didn't have time to look over what the assistants, or ghost writers, or whoever, wrote on this one.
1451627289|4.0|One of the saddest days in my personal life, November 22, 1963 came alive all over again for me with this interesting time travel piece.  It was a real page turner (even though I didn't care for the ending).
B001C4CI8U|4.0|Recently got amazon prime and was looking for something 'free' to watch. Came across Fringe, which I had always knew exsisted but never watched, and I'm hooked! I know the SERIES finale is airing this month, and I'm only halfway through the first season, but I'm excited to see where the show goes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|In all honesty, this book broke me. I came out of it stronger though. Every time that story regained my trust, it dropped a bomb on my head and absolutely shattered me. Bravo, to Mr. Green, for concocting such a masterpiece of wit, cleverness, poetry, death, life, and all the intricacies of what it means to be human and to suffer for it. Hazel is the ideal heroine, terminally ill, lonely and unhappy, but she presses on in life- for herself, her family, and all others around her- even though death is constantly looming in the shadows. She finds a new reason to fight to live in Augustus, the attractive boy she meets that happens to be hilarious, terribly clever, and a cancer survivor currently in remission. It's extremely hard to not to love and feel for each character on a person level, as there is something relatable squeezed into every one of their personalities. Hazel, funny, smart, with a love of reading poetry but not for writing it. Augustus, clever, charming, seemingly fearless but underneath he is frightened he'll become sick again. Hazel's Parents, easily worried, very protective (which is understandable in this circumstance), loyal, and the father is just a touch more on the emotional side than you would come to expect. I have absolutely no complaints. Green's style of writing is truly remarkable, he portrayed the thoughts and conversations of the teens that were the main of the story incredibly well, almost as if he was that age when he wrote it. The plot of the story was so incredibly thought out, everything fit, you were never confused to what was happening or how something happened, you never had a chance to guess what was coming next because you were too entranced in what you were comprehending right that second. That, was one of the huge reasons this book was so heartbreaking. It is exactly like life. You never know what happens on the next page, or even in the next sentence, because you're to busy living to anticipate it. I would suggest reading thiswith a box of tissues close by, you'll need it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|There are so many horrible ads in this program that it makes the game unplayable. I'd honestly rather play this with a deck of cards.
014050639X|5.0|I love this book! I am 30 now, but i still have it memorized from when I was a kid. I sent it to my niece for Christmas in the hopes that she will love it, too!
B004FEJ3VY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my grandson.  He loves playing with it and the many others that he has.  Would recommend highly and is a toy that they play with for hours!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|So many friends have been talking about this series, so now I finally know why. I'm not all the way through Season 1 yet, but can't wait to be able to finish it and Season 2 so I can start watching Season 3 on PBS.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|one of the better games i have ever played on a mobile device. works great on my kindle fire hd
B0055MBQOM|5.0|When looking at the different calibration devices, this one stood out because it could:<br />- calibrate multiple displays connected to the same computer<br />- calibrate those displays to match each other<br />- calibrate the displays on ALL of the computers you own<br />- use the ambient light sensor to control your calibrations over time<br /><br />Those first three points are a major win, and makes this a much better deal than any other calibration system out there.<br /><br />I have now calibrated 4 displays, and my colors look better than ever.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Only complaint is that for the charging port to be accessible when the book is closed, the kindle has to be inserted backwards.  However, this means you can't support it for viewing properly.  I have adjusted, and it's really pretty nice and protective.  Looks much better than the picture too.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Amazing book! Rick Riordan is an amazing author. I must say, I love how detailed he is in his books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A yoyo of emotions making me want to kick Gideon to the curb, then haul him back in a lose myself in his protective embrace. At times I wanted to strangle them both, yelling at them to get on with it and be honest with one another. I kept hitting my finger hard on my kindle to turn the page, needing obsessively to see what would pull these two apart or bring them together next. I was hanging on by a thread, hoping all these emotions would eventually let me breathe. The author finally did that, gave me an anchor to hold onto. I loved this book more than the first. Can't wait for the next in the series!<br />Thank you Sylvia Day for a rockin' read!<br />Oh and I read this book in 24hrs, that says something!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Different type of book but really enjoyed it!  I'm excited to see how the movie will translate!! Easy but  enjoyable read.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Great story with plenty of imagination.  The story line is very creative and the story could be our future?  I hope not.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I've been using AmazonBasics products for a while now and the HDMI cables are absolutely fantastic. A fraction of the price of needlessly overpriced and over engineered competitors, these do the same exact job as any other HDMI cable.  For the last two years I've had a harman/kardon receiver connected to my 50&#34; Samsung LED TV, AT&T U-verse cable, sony blueray player, Apple TV, and XBOX all using these cables and have never had an issue with any of them.
0788859544|5.0|I loved sharing this movie with a second generation member of my family, my grand-daughter. She adored all of the characters in the film, especially, Ariel.The quality of the film was great because of the coloring,sound,and the animation as a whole.<br />It is nice to know that people have access to movies of this nature-where children can enjoy their short childhood fantasies through films with loved ones. I will order other films of this type in the near future.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just amazing I love mythology the way Rick Riordan  puts it together with fiction is amazing I never thought he would be able to make this series.so.successfully
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book very suspenseful was very glad I ended up reading it! I can't wait to read the next one!
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This book was really good. The book did not have a single thing that made it young adult as in inappropriate.It may of had one curse word but that was it! It was a really great book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very easy to use, contains multiple versions for each cross reference and has an offline version that usually works pretty well..
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I might have given this film two stars for at least being pretty to look at, but I deducted one for the damage this did to the series.  It's one thing if you're going to make a bad film that's more style than substance, with characters behaving frustratingly irrationally and 'science' so shoddy and lazy (e.g. &#34;we're half a billion miles from earth&#34;) that I question whether anyone involved actually enjoys the genre. It's another thing entirely to make a bad film that retroactively alters the plot of another beloved classic. If you loved the Alien saga but thought it needed to be less interesting and more Christian, this is the film for you.
B004EKCNMA|2.0|I loved the movie.  I may even purchase it for next Christmas.  It did not stream well though and eventually cut off all together towards the end.  Very disappointing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. Thoroughly kept my attention. I found it easy to read and enjoyment.  I will make sure to recommend it to my friends.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Really well written but not the ending I wanted. It was unfortunate all the characters that were let go. Not the ending that was expected.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I've been watching the show and have been listening them talk about the comic on the Talking Dead and had to see for my self. The comic blew my mind. The ending was the biggest surprise. I was not thinking that would happen. It's a most read book. The kindle fire also made the reading experience better.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Not a good movie.  Boring plot, overdevelopment of noninteresting characters makes movie drag, only action scenes are simple gratuitous bloody violence.  Not worth a rental.  Found myself wanting the end of the movie about half way through, but held on to the end to see if it would get better.  It didn't.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Highly recommend this workout.  It is only 20 minutes.  Tough but as long as you keep doing it - you will see results.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|This was a gift and the recipient loved it with no complaints.  It was requested so I assume there was knowledge about it from the beginning.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is awesome I can't believe I got this game wow it's so great.  You should really get this awesome game
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game. But I won't continue if I have to later pay for a game that was FREE. And I won't bother my friends with it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the wimpy kid series but out of all of the books I choose this one to read.I love every thing about it. I also recommend this book for everyone.
0756405890|5.0|This book was the single most absorbing and entertaining thing I've read in my entire life. I've read it 3 times, and just typing this review makes me want to read it again. More than just telling a story, Rothfuss does an incredible job of creating a world with many cultures, superstitions, sterotypes, sayings, religions, folk lore, and even nursery rhymes. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire is least predictable in terms of plot details of the three books of the Hunger Games trilogy. It's gripping and suspenseful. It's pace is quick and even and the plots has many twists and turns and over all it's just a fun read.
0765325950|4.0|Ignore those one-star reviews complaining about Kindle and e-book editions.  Those people are whining like a bunch of Aes Sedai.  Just buy the hardcover like we've all been doing since the Eye of the World.
B000FC1192|5.0|Coraline was a very original thriller with a mind-bending twist.  I had read The Graveyard Book,(also by<br />Neil Gaiman) and I really liked it.  All in all Coraline was a very good book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Once I started it, it was hard to put down.  Well written and of course quite detailed.  Could have had a better ending, but good scifi, that is very close ot reality actually.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Awesome book. A must read. I have enjoyed reading all of Mitch Alvin books. Looking forward to the next one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen out did herself this time ! I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat but I reallllllly loved Hopeless !!!! I loved the characters and I am going to recommend this book to all my friends !
B009CCBCU4|3.0|Good Read<br />This book was easy to read.  The mechanics of good writing were fine.  There were few errors. I will read the next book in this series after I study the history of Mexico more.  I gave this book three stars because the Highlander boy and the Lowlander boy did not mature in the five year period this book covered.  They matured physically but not mentally, despite many events that would cause young warriors to grow in wisdom.  They were interesting characters set in an interesting place.  I recommend the book to readers who love historical fiction.  This book was a free read from the author.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|After reading this book which I liked a lot. I recommend it for anyone that ever felt felt like an outcast. Because Charlie is a sweet yet damaged kid. (Who is bi-sexual)  and will do anything t just be in the same room as anyone. Because he just wants a friend. Or someone to look at. Which is pathetic yet he does it with flair. Not a must read. But a good filler book that I recommend.
B000YJ6736|4.0|I almost stopped reading this but went on. I am glad I did. It has a lot of life's lessons in it. It was very haunting but really beautiful. No one is perfect and true love hard to come by. It's a real quick read too. Have never read any of the author's books before but am adding him to my list to check out.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|I thought the animation quality was phenomenal and the story line very cute.  My little girl (and boy for that matter) were enthralled.  Great story for kids.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Readers should note that this is 2 books in one. There is the story of poor man who makes the most of life. Then there is the history of France. The long chapters which tell the history of France are interspered in the first story. Both are good.  You may skip one and find the other interesting on its own.
B0086700CM|5.0|GREAT GAME - LOADS OF FUN.  ONCE YOU START CANNOT PUT IT DOWN! JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GAME
1250006341|5.0|This book is just what my wife wanted.<br />Pictures.<br />Back stories.<br />Information about the era.<br /><br />I will be her hero for months!<br /><br />Buy it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the book, already finished reading it and love the fact that I can down load it directly to my ipad Kindle app.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|I've been a big Dark Knight fan ever since I read the original series by Miller decades? ago.  I still have my originals.  To see this animated was really fun.  Can't wait to share it with my son once he's old enough.  A bit too dark for him right now at the tender age of 6 :-)
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was okay, not in love with the writing style.<br />  Want to find out what happens next. I think she uses the word inner goddess way too many times. It was just ok for me.
B0091QS88K|5.0|I played this a couple of times, but it was too easy for my age.  My little sisters LOVE this game and play it ALL the time.  They are 3 and 6.  It is easy to follow, fun making the shakes and you can use any flavor even tho it always shows blueberry.  Also you can wash the tables and dishes.  I would DEFINATELY recommend this to the younger ages.  As for the older kids...I would recommend Diner Dash it is much more fun and more challenging.
B00079ZACM|4.0|The product received was fine but was secondary to my original hope to find the original in black & white. The DVD was wonderful, it was delivered quickly and without any drama. The seller was wonderful.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|This is one of the few CDs that I recommend to all of my friends, regardless of their taste in music.  The music is amazing,the lyrics are incredible, and I love his voice.  What more can you ask for?  And to there isn't a \\"clunker\\" on the whole album.  Highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book to follow hunger games, I can't wait to see the how the movie turns out. One of my favorites  :)
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I have been so excited to have this and the self title album of Halestorm. I enjoy singing myself to the music as I can almost sound like Lizy's voice. Except for the screaming (well it's not really screaming). I enjoy just trainting my voice to sound better then what I used to have it as. This is a wonderful, awesome, successful female vocalist I have heard for a long time. :D ROCK ON SISTER!!!
B000654OUG|5.0|Excellent box set...very satisfied with the quality of the DVD's and sound.  I enjoyed this set very much and recommend it to anyone who loves Mitsuko Uchida.
B000ICM5O4|5.0|Excelente remasterização, a qualidade está muito superior ao primeiro cd, a equalização ficou fiel ao original. O tema do Rocky  brilhantemente executado, é um cd legal de ouvir, não é enjoativo.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A nicely written piece that keeps the pace interesting throughout, and it does inspire one to look at time differently.  It is not as powerful as Tuesdays with Morrie as it lacks the texture, but the fictional aspect of the story makes it a nice piece to read in between our busy days filled with work-emails, news, social media updates, etc.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A lot of fun, hard to put down once you get started playing this game. My entire family plays it.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|Fun book to read. Dont have to think too hard. Not a lot of twists but enough to keep the reader engaged.
B000DZ6VAK|3.0|These DVDS offer excellent listening opportunities and I loved them EXCEPT for the fact that one of the DVD's was damaged.  I was very annoyed with this but loved the rest of the set that I did not bother to send it back.  Luckily the disk damaged was not an important part of the concerto series or otherwise the whole thing would have been returned.  That the is problem with ordering unseen products on the internet...you never know what you are getting.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I enjoyed this book and was looking forward to some conclusion of some of the story lines within these 5 books but I was disappointed.  I just wish something or someone had some type of conclusion to their story...especially if it takes George 4 or 5 years to complete the next book in this series.<br />[[ASIN:0002247399 A Dance with Dragons]]
B004LROUW2|4.0|As a new Murakami reader, I first find this a bit hard to push through, until I got to about 1/3 of it.  His way of telling different sub-stories and how they all link back together was very artful.  The one thing I would hope for is that there wouldn't be so many lose ends as the story ends on what happens to the key characters, but still left me wondering about what happens to the other people.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|We three quit playing both the free and pay versions in frustration over bugs, delays, lost transmissions and poor screen response. Sure, it's free, but if it dumps your picture into outer space, it's frustrating.<br /><br />I hope the people who make this do a better job of pre-launch polishing. Also, the items to draw are pulled from current pop culture very often. This is more of an adult game and we don't care about Justin Timberlake or his ilk. If you are going to dumb it down and pander, make an adult version that works well and it will sell.<br /><br />This is a game that many people try and quit, mostly because it doesn't meet minimum standards.
B00992CF6W|4.0|only if it was free, I would play! it all day long!<br />  {}  {}<br />  (^.^)<br />  &lt;  &gt;<br />  ^  ^<br />(I'm not a girl)
B007BFSYMS|5.0|If u are like me and wake easily at the slightest sound, than this app is for u. I've used a white sound machine for yrs and was so excited to try this one for my tablet. It works great. I have slept through some of the loudest thunderstorms. Great app.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the very best shows on TV today.  Catch Season 1 and 2 on DVD from Amazon to get up to speed to season 3 that just started airing on PBS
B002HL3PN4|5.0|Great casting. Important plot points from the book are hit in the movie. It really stayed with me after watching.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I think it did a great job of addressing problems with older couples.<br />Plenty of good humor throughout the movie.
B00886XQO0|4.0|I use them mostly whilst playing online games on my Playstation3 and the sound I hear through them is just awesome; you can hear each and every footstep within range and also the exact direction it comes from whilst playing first person shooters(like black ops II). The only problem I've got is that they won't connect to my smart  phone through bluetooth and I've seen that there are quite a few smart phones they won't connect to, but the fact is that I bought them for gaming and they work amazing for that, so I'm completely satisfied!
B009NPA3MS|4.0|Love this first album.  Something new, fresh, relavent. I really look forward to what this guy has to offer in the future.  Love the guitar, the voice, the whole package.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Did not contradict the general views of<br />others' NDEs.  His perspective was unique<br />as depicted in scientific terms and was<br />very convincing..
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game. You can never go wrong with solitary.<br />It's fun and quick to play when you want something to do but not a lot of time on your hands. I also like that if I have to do something at that moment I can just close my kindle and come back to it later.
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a great book. I loved it. the only problem with it is I couldn't find another book with John Puller in it that I had not already read. I want to know why Robert is in jail for treason. If anybody knows which Baldacci book this is in please let me know.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|This is a wonderful read. It is the book that made me interested in Australia and I have now written a term paper and given a speech about various aspects of Australian people and politics respectively. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in Australia or who likes humorous writing that also has gives a lot of useful and insightful information.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My fiance loved the attractive case and the fact this movie came with digital edition + blu ray. He's a big movie fan!
B0002HYHSW|5.0|I love games that are made of wood.  Haba is a well known company in Germany.  They have great fantastic games.  I got this one for my 3 year old and she loves it.  Great for developing fine motor and reasoning skills.

B004SDEP38|5.0|Great tool to permit greater use of Excel files created on PC but used on iPad or Nexus 7.  Main and full well worth the cost for the full package.
B0083VP2KQ|3.0|I got the 3d version of this and though the effects were excellent, the narrative content was basically a march of death, one kill after another.  Interesting for awhile but eventually it just seemed to make these animals out to be mindless eating machines with identical pointy tails, and slightly different sized teeth.<br /><br />There was a short respite in the relentless drum beat of dining where a herd of Ceratopsians drowned crossing a river (for once, not eaten) but the narration took special care to say \\"wholesale slaughter occurred\\" at least six times, and follow their sinking carcasses down into the deep.<br />The movie ended with the ever famous asteroid heading for the Gulf of Mexico, where we got the pleasure of watching ALL of them keel over, choke whither and die.<br /><br />Did they do anything but kill and fight off being killed?  Surely this is only a very small part of their day.... but then maybe thats what the public craves.  As for me I was looking for a little more variety and depth.  Might try Dinotasia or Giants of Patagonia.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book , it grabs your attention and holds on . I  always love Nicholas sparks books , the man is a wonderful writer .
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber should have rested on the laurels of the Phantom. This sequell has ruined my all time favorite musical. To me the love story had been about Raoul & Christine and love conquers all. In this sequel it turns out that the Phantom really was nothing more than a Pedophile and a stalker. Christine had gotten pregnant by the Phantom then passed the child off as Raouls who had become a drunken gambler and had lost his fortune.Meg Ghiry meanwhile had prostituted herself to help the phantom get back on his feet. Overall a huge disappontment
030758836X|4.0|This book started off great! It grabbed me right away and I switched back and forth between liking and not liking Nick and Amy. The big disappointment came at the end of the book. What a horrible way to end the story!!! It basically wasn't even an ending, it kind of just stopped. I'm actually pissed off about how the story ended, feels like I read the book for nothing but to be left mad at the end. I almost thought I was missing pages, no way the author would end the story this way?!! It seems like she got tired of writing the book and just gave up. If you decide to read it, be prepared to be left waiting at the end for something more.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Upgraded my phone and lost the app. This is a great app as i've found some great new music and artists.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I purchased the Anker Astro2 Dual USB 8400 mAH battery pack on January 4th and was marked shipped on January 6th.  It took 2 days (arrived today, January 8th) from the 6th to arrive, so I'm really happy it got here so quick, even with Amazon's Free Super Saver Shipping deal, which takes 5 to 8 business days, according to Amazon.<br /><br />Flaslight review:  The Flashlight works well enough if you need one.  It's not the brightest I've seen, but I've used lights that weren't as bright.<br /><br />Now for the actual review for the battery itself:<br /><br />I used the supplied cable & tip versus my own cable.  I only tested my Google Nexus 7 at this point.  Using Google's cable, it will charge under the 2 amp port, but not at a rate of 2 amps.  Using Anker's supplied cable, it charged much faster than using Google's cable on the charger.  I heard someone else mention that before receiving the Anker Astro in the mail, so I'm not really surprised by that.  There is one thing I was a bit surprised by though:  I may have faulty cables, but if I simply move my Nexus or Anker, my Nexus easily stops charging until I put the cable in a position that will keep the Nexus charging up.  Using the Google cable, I haven't notice any disconnections.  I don't know if it's just the Nexus, I have yet to try another device.  I will update once I use enough of my PSP battery power to see if the same thing happens since the PSP model I have also needs 2 amps to charge.<br /><br />Edit 01/09/13<br /><br />After testing it more, it's working just fine.  Only time I seem to notice a weakness is when using the Anker micro usb tip to charge my Nexus or using it to connect to my computer for the Anker battery to charge.  When using the PSP tip, I didn't really notice any problems.  When I charged my Nexus, I just let it stand in one position while charging it rather than moving it any amount while it's charging.  Used about half of the battery yesterday after charging the Anker up all the way,my Nexus 7 was at around 65% of a battery charge and took an hour and a half to charge up all the way with the Anker.
B008VVT51U|5.0|Although the theme may not be realistic, that does not seem to matter.  The film is extremely entertaining, and the settings are very exotic and characteristic of India.  The characters are well-drawn and mirror the feelings and experiences of retirees who come from the British culture.  The acting is moving and convincing, perhaps because the roles are played by well-known or talented actors.  The adjustment factor, including the pain of the unfamiliar, is starkly expressed.  I enjoyed the film.[[ASIN:B005S9EJ14 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel]]
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I bought this app so I could take notes on the multitude of pdfs I use in graduate school. I LOVE it. I use it nearly every day. You can write comments and then all of the comments are compiled in a list. Click on the comment then it brings you to that page. Awesome feature.
B007SGM084|5.0|This was a really great read.  Got the trilogy, it really held my attention.  I could not wait to go back to reading whenever I took a break.
B009VL299E|5.0|This is a great dvd, the first disc is over 2 hours of songs, the second disc has 40 minutes worth of bonus songs. Although they play mostly songs off the Death Magnetic album they do throw in alot of old stuff which is great. This is a awesome dvd and you can see how these guys are now rock/metal legends now, love em or hate em. If you're a Metallica fan I recommend this dvd.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|I saw the movie trailer for this book and was intrigued.  It was a great story of overcoming obstacles in life.  I would recommend this book!
B008476HBM|5.0|It is a work of art. How I have fallen in love with these characters!! The interactions between Lizzy and Darcy are so endearing. The language is beautiful!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|I thought the movie lacked action and took too long to get to the little action they had. I figure when you watch a BAtman movie you expect some fight scenes and cool gadgets but this movie lacked both. Batman wasn't even batman for most of the movie. Overall, I wish I waited for the free instant video instead of paying for it, but  I did save $2 by renting the movie through Amazon instead of my cable carrier so I was not too unhappy, but wait for the DVD.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was incredible. I read it in less than 24 hours because I literally couldn't put it down. Worth the money!

B000NU2CY4|5.0|This movie is outstanding! I already owned the regular widescreen and I wanted to get the blu-ray transfer. The quality is great and the sound is also great. I wont spoil it for those who have not purchased this version, but the footage that was added was a excellent and it helps you see further into the characters; some scene make more sense with the added footage.<br /><br />Overall a great product and I highly recommend this movie!
B001OQCV2E|5.0|love this movie, great action, actors and effects, I'd seen the movie some time ago on a rental and had thought about getting it, went to a big box store to get out of the bargain bin, the employee said they had 3 copies in the bin some place and i had to dig for them, an hours later ... nothing, went home and ordered it from Amazon, got the movie a day early, even though it was sent via Fedex i got if from USPS, which worked for me.<br /><br />worth the buy even though we really know how 2012 actually ended ... lol

0765325950|2.0|I started reading The Wheel of Time when I was 11. I read The Eye of the World on the bus to summer camp.<br /><br />I'm 32 now, and I want to be able to say, what a triumph! It was Worth it! I feel fulfilled!<br />But that's not the truth.<br /><br />This was devestating to grind through. It was too long, too many battles, basically going over the same things over and over again. (at least that's how it felt... How many did I read Trolloc Corpses, and \\"outnumbered?\\")<br />Ugggggg....<br /><br />The end was so abrupt. You spend 885 pages going over a 'war' and have 20 or so pages of wrap up. I feel like I've been a house wife raising four kids for 20 years and my partner just told me he's running away with his secretary and he's going to make sure I don't get anything.<br /><br />But, if your actually considering reading this book, it's because like me, you've been paying attention to this story for at least a decade. And you aren't going to skip it because of a few bad reviews. You don't have a choice. I know I didn't.<br /> Just don't get your hopes up, and maybe you will still find some enjoyment in this.<br /><br />I think I smiled 3 times during the whole ordeal. They were all at moments of self sacrifice on behalf of key characters.<br />I give this book enthusiastic two thumbs down. And I've invested so much of my life in it, I still can't give it 1 star.<br />On the plus side, the waiting is OVER.<br /><br />I must also say that this whole 1 star ebook nonsense makes me feel sick.<br />The Dark One seems to have won over our hearts already if this is what we've come to.<br /><br />Blood and bloody ashes, what a disappointment this has been!

0062206281|5.0|Brilliant. Another magical novel from one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />PRISONER OF HEAVEN is the third book in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books library, which includes The Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game.  The books can be read in any order, as they compliment one another, but none is needed to understand the others.  That being said, I do wish I had re-read the other two books before diving into this one.<br /><br />Before I get started on my review, I feel I must say a little something about the my experience with Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n's books.  All of them, each and every one, are among my favorite books of all time.  They offer everything - rich characters, vivid locations, heart-pounding mysteries, and they are all centered around the love of books.  If you have yet to discover this author, do not hesitate!<br /><br />PRISONER OF HEAVEN opens at Sempere & Sons bookshop in 1957 Barcelona. A mysterious man comes into the store asking for Ferm&iacute;n , Daniel Sempere's closest friend.  The man buys the most expensive book in the shop without asking for change, entering an inscription for Fermin, thus opening up the dark and troubled secrets of 1939, the Prison of Montjuic Castle, an imprisoned writer, and Daniel Sempere's own mother.<br /><br />Readers are taken on a journey to unlocking the long-buried secrets of The Prisoner of Heaven, a character whom readers of The Angel's Game already know. Fans will enjoy the interweaving characters, stories and the living, breathing setting of Barcelona we have grown to love through Zaf&oacute;n's other books. New readers will also be offered the gift of a simply amazing book.<br /><br />When THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN arrived at the bookshop (of course I had pre-ordered a book from one of my favorite authors) the first thing that struck me was how short it was.  Coming in under 300 pages, this companion was half the size of the other two in the set.  For this reason, I was worried it might not be quite as epic as I had hoped.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Really good fun read, he's a great storyteller. I'd recommend this to anyone thinking about running in barefoot or minimalist shoes. Don't expect logic and a reasoned argument for barefoot running, but instead a great tale about some amusing characters that do.

0812993292|5.0|It's the journey, not the destination. Take this journey with Harold Fry.<br /><br />Harold's retired life in a small English village is little more than similar days running into one another.  His wife usually tells him what to do, and how he did it wrong.  He notices his wife's pain in not seeing their son, but he never talks to her about it.  Not much changes until one day he gets a brief, typed letter from Queenie, a woman he used to work with twenty years ago.  She writes to tell him goodbye, as she is reaching the end of her battle with cancer.  Harold writes a brief, but friendly, note in return.  When he goes out to the post box to mail his letter, he decides to walk a little farther to the next one.  Before long, he decides that he isn't going to mail his letter, he is going to bring it to Queenie himself.  So, Harold Fry sets off on a six hundred mile walk to say goodbye, with nothing more than the clothes on his back and the yachting shoes on his feet.<br /><br />Something in this novel made me think of Forrest Gump or Olive Kitteridge.  Simple, beautiful, and touching, this story is full of human moments that many of us take for granted.<br /><br />It's as much about Harold Fry, his flaws and his self-discovery, as it is about the different people he meets on his journey.  He inherently believes in the good of people, and very rarely do they disappoint him.  I couldn't help but see myself as a cynic, as I have long since lost my faith in humanity.  Harold reminded me that there is good in people, even when they aren't necessarily making the right choices.<br /><br />Probably my favorite part of the story is that of Harold's wife, Maureen. She has her own journey, and her own awakening, without which I'm sure the novel wouldn't be complete.<br /><br />This was not an action-packed thriller, or a sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat courtroom drama, but there was something about this book that called to me and I couldn't put it down.  The writing was was extraordinary.<br /><br />I did gasp at one point...and I wouldn't dare tell you why.<br /><br />There are several people I know who are going to love this book as much as I did...I think I might just walk it over to them.nary.<br /><br />I did gasp at one point...and I wouldn't dare tell you why.<br /><br />There are several people I know who are going to love this book as much as I did...I think I might just walk it over to them.

B0064NTZKI|5.0|Woody Allen is almost certainly the greatest modern filmaker.  This DVD, based mainly on Woody's words is a excellant doorway into the man and artist..  I found it entertaining and absorbing..  If you like any of Woody's films or are a devoted fan  this title is a must have.

0143119680|4.0|If you love a great vampire love story, but could do without the teen angst, you'll love DISCOVERY OF WITCHES, the first book in the All Souls Trilogy!<br /><br />Witches, vampires and daemons...oh MY!  Historian Dr. Diana Bishop is determined to live her life as an ordinary human and not as one of the famous Bishop witches, descended from Bridget Bishop, the first witch burned at the stake during the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.  Unfortunately, magic seems to find her anyway while at Oxford's Bodleian Library.<br /><br />Diana opens a manuscript which was believed to be lost, since its last sighting was over one hundred years ago.  She feels magic in the manuscript, but ignores it and sends it back, thinking that she is sending away the magic that lurks within the pages.<br /><br />\\"Even at a safe distance, this manuscript was challenging me - threatening the walls I'd erected to separate my career as a scholar from my birthright as the last of the Bishop witches.\\"<br /><br />Only, it's too late.  She has attracted the attention of all the creatures in Oxford, and beyond, including the attention of Matthew Clairmont, who happens to be a geneticist and a vampire.  Matthew is a very old vampire with a long history and a small, interesting family. Enter the vampire, his family, their history, and a love of wines.<br /><br />Let me talk about Diana a bit.  She is a historian, which is highly convenient considering how old Matthew Clairmont is.  Even though she has her weaknesses, and has blocked out her powers her whole life, she's tough, and I like that.  One of the wonderful things about Diana's profession is her love of libraries and books, which Harkness puts into words for her readers:<br /><br />\\"The smell of the library always lifted my spirits - that peculiar combination of old stone, dust, woodworm, and paper made properly from rags.\\"<br /><br />This was only one sentence among a hundred describing the sights, sounds, and smells of the various libraries that Diana visits throughout the book.  I don't want to ruin any of the plot by telling you any more.<br /><br />In fact, soon after the first 100 pages, I stopped taking notes on people, place, or favorite passages.  The first hundred or so pages were interesting, but it wasn't until I hit a certain point that the book sucked me in.  The investment of those first chapters paid off.<br /><br />Vampire love story?  Really?  Yes, really.  Deborah Harkness creeps very close to the line where style and substance meets cheesy cliche, but she does not cross it.  There is one particular conversation toward the end of the book that made me groan aloud, as it reminded me of another, ridiculous, storyline I had read a few years ago.  Luckily for us, the author saves us from the nausea and keeps A DISCOVERY OF WITCHES from turning into a gooey mess.<br /><br />This book has been described as the \\"grown up's\\" Twilight.  Let me be clear about one thing - there is nothing profane about it..  Instead, there are complex discussions of historical people and places, strategy and logic, as well as genetics and biochemistry.  Somehow, it is not at all boring, I promise.  Not once did I find myself wanting to skim over the science.

0761163808|5.0|This was the talk of christmas in my family.  I don't know how they did it but as you turn the pages the animals look like the are alive and moving.  The family and extended family couldn't get enough of this book.  Really a great gift.
B00000IZOR|3.0|A family friend suggested getting our 14-month old daughter a &#34;pull toy&#34; for Christmas.  When I stumbled upon this, I thought I had the perfect gift.  But when we actually opened it on Christmas day, I realized that there had been some changes, likely in the name of safety.  The phone cord is now so short that you have to pick up both the phone and the handset to be able to hold it to your ear.  I'm sure they did it because it was a strangulation risk, but it kind of makes the toy difficult to use.  I wish I had gotten her a toy cell phone instead.

0761171703|4.0|This book makes me happy.<br /><br />Expecting the unexpected.  In his new book, DANCERS AMONG US, Photographer Jordan Matter takes dancers and puts them into ordinary situations, making the scenes beautiful and extraordinary - on a beach, at a construction site, in a library, or at a Subway platform.<br /><br />There is something about dance that evokes a strong emotional response from me, so I can't tell you how many times I have flipped through this book and smiled, laughed, and even teared up.  I have such an appreciation for this art form- its movement, its strength, and its poetry.  Yet Jordan Matter takes dance to another level by his still photographs.  Not only are the photographs beautiful, but they all seem to move!<br /><br />For anyone who loves dance, anyone who loves photography, or anyone who wants to see ordinary things through an artist's eyes, DANCERS AMONG US is a wonderful book.  I know there will be wrapped copies under the tree this Christmas!<br /><br />Gorgeous!

0307956350|3.0|Lukewarm...<br /><br />I loved the premise of THE EXPATS.  Woman turns away from the spy world to enjoy the normal life she has created with her husband and children, only to find out that the spy world has followed her.<br /><br />The books I like, but don't love are the hardest to review.  First off, let me say that this was an enjoyable book and one that makes for good discussion.  The pages turned quickly, and there was a good amount of suspense, the reader never knowing who to trust, or what was lurking behind the next corner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when it comes to breaking a book apart - the characters, the predictability, the inconsistencies, I could very easily be all over this one.  I don't want to pull it apart, though, because I did like it.  I just didn't love it.<br /><br />Probably the toughest thing for me, which many people won't care about at all, is the flawed heroine.  I wanted her to be fierce.  I wanted her to kick some ass.  I wanted her to be smarter and quicker and stronger than everyone around her, putting to task her own skills as a spy.  Alas, this is not the character Chris Pavone wrote.  Kate didn't want to see the truth.  She wanted so badly to keep her past hidden and safe that she didn't act on those doubts tugging at her.  I get that, but her one big spy scene, she made a rookie mistake!  You can make her flawed, Mr. Pavone, but don't make her incompetent.  And was there an error of convenience to let her get away with it or was she actually caught?<br /><br />The range of responses THE EXPATS has been receiving makes this a good Book Club candidate.  I guarantee you that no two readers will have the same opinion of Kate, her family, her friends, or the story itself.  Lukewarm for me, sure, but go find out for yourself...then, grab a glass of wine and come talk to me.<br /><br />It might not have been one of my favorites, but there are enough readers gushing over THE EXPATS, you should go give it a try.

B005LAII80|5.0|When I watched Dredd 3D in theaters when it was released I wasn't quite sure what to expect - I hadn't seen a single trailer, heard nothing about movie or it's director or stars other than quite a few positive reviews from RottenTomatoes. The movie blew me away in it's sheer greatness: the hard industrial soundtrack, the gritty realistic violence, the cinematography, and the 3D visuals are truly awesome especially during the \\"slo-mo\\" shootouts.<br /><br />Whereas The Dark Knight Rises, Amazing Spider-Man and The Avengers were big budget crowd pleasers (and there's nothing wrong with that as they are quality films) I found that Dredd holds nothing back and is easily my favorite comic book film adaptation of 2012. I picked up the 3D Blu-Ray yesterday and it's just as fantastic of an experience at home as it was on the big screen. Don't hesitate, buy this film - you won't be disappointed.
B008B0QH5S|3.0|With \\"Elysium,\\" the Pet Shop Boys take a lighter approach to the grooves. This is a very tranquil album, comparable to \\"Release\\" from 2002. Maturity has crept into the oeuvre, letting the tempos slow down for the most part while the introspective lyrics take their precious time working their way into your consciousness. Songs like \\"Invisible\\" or \\"Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin\\" carefully dissect the duo's often ironic worldview.<br /><br />The Boys don't completely stay in midtempo land. The short but biting \\"Your Early Stuff\\" is reminiscent of \\"Yesterday When I Was Mad,\\" about a chance meeting with a casual fan who asks ridiculous questions and asks about the management that rips you off when you're a pop star. There's the danceable \\"A Face Like That\\" and the funny \\"Ego Music\\" where Neil Tennant declares \\"I am my own demographic\\" over a dance beat. There's also the Olympic anthem, \\"Winning,\\" which is triumphant without being histrionic.<br /><br />The lighter touch to most of the songs is something of a hindrance to the album overall, as \\"Elysium\\" takes several listens to take hold. Like the underrated \\"Bilingual\\" and again, \\"Release,\\" the album seems like a holding pattern. Fans will be pleased, but casual listeners may find it too bland to take.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag is roomy, but not really convenient. I had a sling bag, it feels heavy over time, but it was very convenient, you sling you get the camera, after finish your shoots, put it back for protection. This one is much bigger, can put a lot lenses that I don't have, but I'll have to take it off, take the camera out, and put it on, but the camera should be on my neck all the time to a point that I feel really no use of it for a time. Don't know how to make it easier to use.

1439152802|4.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's books and been to several of her personal appearances. Ms. Morton is engaging, personable and attractive and I would say the same about her books. The Secret Keeper is no exception. Like each of the other books, the story is told with interrupted narrative that switches between time periods and often between points of view. She uses this device well to reveal her puzzle in pieces to the reader. It can be tedious and it can be engaging. Usually in her books, it is engaging. The twist in the Secret Keeper is not terribly surprising, but I think that is because she did a good job of building up to the reveal and making it tie things together. Her books have an excellent sense of time and place. Here the story is in England, alternating between London during the blitz in WWII and present day settings in London, Oxford and the countryside. Ms. Morton is Australian and there is often some connection to Australia in her books. The connection here is small. I understand that there are so many Anglophiles that an English setting may help sales, but I would love to have her write a novel where the primary setting is Australia. The Australian bits are often my favorite parts. Some books change your life, some books change the world, some books are offensive and some are just bad. Her books are none of those. They are however entertaining, well written, and worth reading. If you consider that for a $9 movie ticket you get roughly two hours of entertainment, the price of the book is an excellent value for the hours that you can enjoy reading  the story. My book group has been meeting for almost 25 years. The Secret Keeper is the kind of book that many of us will read and enjoy, but it will not be a book group selection for us because there is not enough to talk about.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Very interesting. Needed to be longer.  The game was half over when I was asked to pay. But overall enjoyed it.

B0054YIQK8|5.0|The best rendition of Carmen that I have ever seen. Julia Migenes is superb, the recording is breathtaking. Highly recommend.
0374214913|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was an Amazon recommendation to me and I doubt that I would have heard of it otherwise. Mr. Penumbra's 24 hour Bookstore is not enjoyable so much because of the plot. That is hard for me to say, because I can be a very plot-driven reader. The charm is in the quirkiness of the characters, the settings and the plot. My best description is that it is a cross between Coupland's Microserfs and Julia Stuart's books such as The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise, the Matchmaker of Perigord,  and the Pigeon Pie Mystery. Sounds weird and there is nothing that these books really have in common except a light touch, likeable characters, and quirkiness that is attractive and not just strange. I don't know these people and I don't live in their world, but Mr. Sloan makes me believe them, care about them and enjoy spending time with them. I will be definitely be watching for another of his books. My book group has been meeting for almost 25 years. Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore is the kind of book that a handful of us will read and enjoy, but it will not be a book group selection for us because there is not enough to talk about. It was a good use of time and money in comparison to the entertainment value.

B000002UDG|5.0|Paul McCartney is one particular artist that has NOT issued an endless stream of compilation albums. \\"Wings Greatest\\", \\"All The Best\\", and \\"Wingspan\\" are it for the western market.  Each release has pretty much made the prior release obsolete.  If you are looking for a quick, inexpensive primer to the world of McCartney then \\"All The Best\\" is the CD for you.<br /><br />It is a straight up pop singles collection of his highest charting work.  Despite it's mid-80s release date, it wisely omits most of the sub-par material of the early 80s and focused on the Wings-era material.  Personally and despite it's number one status, I would have loved to see \\"Say Say Say\\" switched out with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\".  I think most reviewers here would agree.<br /><br />All in all if you are shopping for this collection, then you aren't a fan with all the albums already.  You are someone curious about getting into his music or are just a casual listener.  Most likely once you start listening to the CD you will realize that you already know the vast majority of these songs and remember hearing them on the radio way back when.  You will be pleased with your purchase.<br /><br />If however, you have some coin in your pocket or would like a more immersive introduction, then \\"Wingspan\\" is for you.<br /><br />As a side note to music history buffs:  The original concept for this album was going to be a 2 disc set, one of hits and one of unreleased music to date.  McCartney had been working on this concept for years polishing up old left-over Wings tracks.  It was to be called \\"Hot Hits/Cold Cuts\\"  The Cold Cuts half of the album has been floating around for decades in various forms as bootlegs.  All the work over the years on the cold cut tracks have created several versions of the songs in various stages of completion and overdubbing.  Alas the project was scrapped and just \\"All The Best\\" was released.  As for the cold cuts, most have very slowly trickled out in subsequent years:  B-sides tothe \\"Put It There\\" single, \\"The In-Laws\\" soundtrack, and the posthumus \\"Wild Prarie\\" to name a few.  I can only image that the songs will be properly resurrected in some way for the Archives Collection project.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and the acting by the main characters were great.  The plot isn't as complicated as Memento or Inception (2 great movies), and it moves along as a nice pace with lots of violent scenes.  I think you will enjoy the movie more if you try not to think to hard, and just go for the ride.  I think the main idea of the movie is about a guy who had a sinful lifestyle (killing people, and doing drugs), and how in the end he redeemed himself for the sake of a love between Mom and son which may change the course of history for the better.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|Maybe better.  Bought along with documentary, MR. MOJO RISIN: THE STORY OF LA WOMAN, which I had just seen on SMITHSONIAN NETWORK.  Crammed full of music, archival footage, and present-day retrospective by remaining band members and other participants - provides a whole new vantage point as listener.<br /><br />I ended up giving the DVD and CD to nephew, affectionate of everything 1960's.  Will buy both again for myself.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am still thinking about this book over 24 hours after finishing it. I feel like I will continue to think about it for months, if not years, because I have been \\"that\\" affected by it. I am still at a loss as to what I should feel but I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone. It is thought provoking and will make you question what you would do in the same situation, which I hope you never find yourself in. I saw this book reviewed in People magazine and decided to give it a shot. After reading the free preview, I just had to know what happens and several hours later I had finished it. This is well worth the emotional roller coaster ride that I am still on. Touching story, maybe a tad predictable but I got so pulled in that it didn't matter. The multiple view points were interesting and I do wish we had more from Will's point of view although that might have just shattered me. I was in tears multiple times already. I will definitely check out other books from this author and I can't believe it's only January and I might just have read the best book of the year already.
B009UMTMKS|4.0|This is a great piece of work. Very usefull foor consultants. A practical approach that we can explain to our customers.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|I just got this movie today in mail and i'm watching right now. Wonderful color and sound for a blu-ray. For anyone who has this on dvd I say yes on getting it for blu-ray. And I got a great price for it also. I just can't get over how clear the picture and color is. I'm so glad I upgraded to blu-ray. You just can't go wrong on getting this.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Sorry for not rating this earlier. Everything went as it should, fast shipping and DVD plays with no problems. Thank you very much.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Some time travel movies tend to confuse, but this one a simple premise.  Future you comes back in time to stop something in the current you's time.  The ending is not the choice I would have made, but understand that some would do it differently.  Very good movie.  Good acting, good plot.
1451696191|5.0|My best friend Evan gave me this book when I was 17. I'm now 25, almost 26. It has been - and will remain - one of my favorites.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the style of Mr. Chbosky's writing. Perhaps it was Charlie's voice. Perhaps it was the fact that all of those horrible things Charlie had been through were curled up inside of me - I'd been through them, too. And I got better. He got better.<br /><br />It's funny how one book hits you and sticks with you. I've read it close to 50 times (if not more), and just this past Sunday, my boyfriend and I watched the movie. When Mr. Anderson (Charlie's English teacher) said 'We accept the love we think we deserve,' I burst into tears.<br /><br />It might be a little too 'adult' for younger readers, and it might deal with some touchy subjects - but for those people that are shocked and appalled, well... worse things happen everyday. To actual people. Stephen Chbosky isn't overly graphic about what happened to Charlie. He sort of skirts it, while dropping enough hints so that someone with knowledge of these issues will know what he's talking about.<br /><br />Here comes the cheesy, cliche part - Awesome book! Incredible book! You'll enjoy reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower.
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of the best or the best of Vince Flynn.  He usually has a slow start and then builds up to a fast ending.  This time it was a faster start and a successful climax to a great tale.  Current history.
0525952926|5.0|While the series (so far) is not as gripping, or as well written, as &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; and &#34;World Without End&#34; it is still a wonderful and engrossing read.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I believe it to be one of the best of the Ice Age series. My 4 1/2 year old great-great niece watched it for the 1st time and we had to see it again. She really liked Granny and Precious!
0739366408|3.0|Interesting idea, and angle on the &#34;zombie&#34; universe. But I had a hard time listening too it, since the voice actors sounded too much like &#34;just reading a script&#34; instead of letting it flow, as if it had actually happened too them. Get a used copy, and then pass it on. I listened too it once, and I don't think I'll &#34;pick up this book&#34; again. It's just o.k., for me.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I was not sure what to expect, but very enjoyable from start to finish.  Be sure to watch it soon.
0670023329|5.0|Read this book in two days and it's mind blowing that these events actually happened. And we're not talking about 1945, WWII era events which are synonymous with gulags and concentration camps...we're talking about as recently as 2002. 10 years ago! And I'm sure as I did, you'll have to pause while reading and remind yourself that this isn't fiction.<br /><br />Won't go over too much about the book as other reviewers have already done so. However it truly is a must read. One of my favorite parts of the book is toward the ends where the author is drawing comparisons between North and South Korea...and just how really different they are.<br /><br />I'll say no more other than, get the book.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Horrible, I rented this on a recommendation and now I will never get back that hour and 47 minutes.  Complete waste of my time.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Can't tell u in detail but movie was really good so I had to get it as a gift for a great friend
1451695195|5.0|I heard the arthur talk on T V and was very interested. I am a great believer of life after death and wanted to read his experience. I gave 3 of the books for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them. The book was Proof of Heaven.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I bought this item for my husband who was waiting and waiting for the Trilogy to be released. He LOVED it! It's perfect for any Batman fan and/ or as a present. Great buy!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|one of the best books ever i just loved it i give it ten out of ten bram stoker live on
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Awesome game. Fun to waste a lot of time. Definitely worth the 99 cents. Kill my battery daily bc of playing.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app is a great way to pass the time. Better than cut the rope and it's FREE !!  This is definitely a &quot;must have&quot;.
0765325950|1.0|A good comparison of not publishing in ebook format is &#34;withholding of newer drugs, by drug companies till patents of the older drugs run out&#34;. Definitely not buying the paper format. I waited till  patiently till January despite knowing Sanderson had finished the book back in July 2012, I can wait till April.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is awesome but I cant play with other people around the world and plz plz plz plz plz plz plz
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It seemed like it would be fun and turned out I couldn't put my tab down. Once I got the hang of manipulating my plague, it was over. Well worth the buck I paid. Recommend to everyone.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Great read, the perspective is astonishingly fresh and the writing is well able to incite laughter, indignation and anger as intended. Great story and you will not be sorry you picked it up
B004SB60OC|5.0|this is the perfect gift for a person who love new different type of music and of course Christina have a lovely voice.
B002C949KE|4.0|I really enjoyed the lesson of human behavior that are taught in this book. To see how our biases, preconditioning, atmosphere, expectation, and past experiences can affect the way we perceive a situation was enlightening. One tone of the book that I did not enjoy was the typical academic approach towards business and recent events such as the mortgage crisis. This book focuses on corporate greed as the sole cause, when the issue is much more complex than that...Mr. Ariely's biases shine brightly when he discusses this issue. Overall though, this was a book worth reading, and one that I am putting into practice in order to better understand, communicate, and function in the world around me.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The lorax is a decent movie for kids that parents will also enjoy. Cute funny cute funny cute funny. Watch.
0399157565|4.0|In her 20th outing, Scarpetta receives an email containing a .jpg of a severed human ear, which is revealed to be that of a missing paleontologist, Emma Shubert. This disappearance is then tied to a woman's body pulled from a waterway after having been attached to a huge leatherback turtle.<br /><br />The title is a reference to Shubert's profession, as she was digging in a \\"bone bed\\" where the remains of several rare dinosaurs were found. Between the brief description of the dinosaurs and the large leatherback turtle that shows up in another chapter, this feels really forced and contrived. Cornwell has always done good research and it shows again here, as we get information ranging from dinosaur trivia to forensic details on chemicals needed to freeze a human body, nautical knots, bowling movies, and Twitter accounts. I liked Cornwell's characterizations here, as Scarpetta seems to be returning to her no-nonsense, in control, medical examiner persona; however, this persona is often at odds with Marino and Lucy.<br /><br />My chief complaint is that this book feels like a retread of other Scarpetta novels. The killer's backstory is a nice return to form (especially given the werewolf novels, which in my opinion drove the series over the rails). However, several \\"we've seen this before\\" themes occur:<br />1. Scarpetta is betrayed by an employee (seen in \\"Cruel and Unusual\\" and \\"Port Mortuary\\") and she doesn't understand why.<br />2. Marino and/or Lucy is unstable (seen in pretty much every book)<br />3. Scarpetta is attacked by the killer (seen in almost every book, including \\"Postmortem\\" and \\"Body of Evidence\\")<br />4. A colleague, especially a female colleague, has it in for Scarpetta (see the Diane Bray storyline in \\"Black Notice\\"); here, it's a female FBI agent as well as an attorney and, briefly, the doctor who examines the leatherback turtle.<br />5. Lucy hacks into something she shouldn't (seen in every novel since \\"Postmortem\\" when Scarpettta though she had reformatted her hard drive)<br /><br />What I did find different is that Scarpetta is now seeing herself as a \\"trophy\\" by younger men, including a new pathologist, Dr. Luke Zenner, the nephew of Scarpetta's late friend, Anna Zenner. This comes in stark contrast to earlier novels where Scarpetta downplays her looks. Here it seems as though she is going through a midlife crisis. While Scarpetta is courageous as always (when the killer attacks her, she attacks right back with a scalpel), this book doesn't feel like a return to form for the author. I contrast this with the novels of Marcia Muller, whos PI Sharon McCone has seen well over 20 novels and is still going strong, without all the emotional baggage that Cornwell's characters haven't unpacked yet.eformatted her hard drive)<br /><br />What I did find different is that Scarpetta is now seeing herself as a \\"trophy\\" by younger men, including a new pathologist, Dr. Luke Zenner, the nephew of Scarpetta's late friend, Anna Zenner.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|She has a classic voice. Totally enjoyable, can be played frequently without getting tired of it. It's a good purchase.
B00867GHS8|5.0|If you love Disney movies like I love Disney movies this is a must buy (for the kids). wink wink ......
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|If you want to watch a very funny movie that is very much a senseless and inmature film about a guy who grows up with a talking Teddy bear then this is the movie. What makes the movie is how the Teddy bear transforms your viewpoint of what a Teddy bear would be like if it could talk and come alive and grow up with you into adulthood. Some of the movie was terribly over blown with trying to be dramatic and make this a romantic comedy which I found that to be more of a stretch for the movie then anything. Take this movie at face value as a funny movie about what your favorite stuffed animal would do if it came alive and became the dirty teddy bear of your adult life.
030758836X|3.0|From the reviews, I was probably expecting too much and ended up being disappointed.  But I do really love Amy's diary entries.  Gillian Flynn understands psychology and people very well.  The diary entry about men and \\"the Cool Girl\\" was something I think a lot of us know but have never heard anyone actually say out loud.  Bravo for that! \\"That night at the Brooklyn party, I was playing the girl who was in style, a girl a man like Nick wants: The Cool Girl.  Men always say that as the defining compliment, don't they?  She's a cool girl.  Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she's hosting the world's biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot.  Hot and understanding...  Men actually think this girl exists.  Maybe they're fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl.  For a long time, Cool Girl offended me.  I used to see men -- friends, coworkers, strangers -- giddy over these awful pretender women, and I'd want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who'd like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them.  I'd want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The bitch doesn't really love chili dogs that much -- no one loves chili dogs that much.\\"  There are parts of this book I will probably copy and reread, but much of it is overrated.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Rodriguez has a haunting style - intense lyrics and a voice that captivates. His songs stay in memory well after hearing them. Both this album and Searching for Sugar man are well worth purchasing.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved the Dark Knight Trilogy and I loved the price even more. I cost less than the Dark Knight Rises Bluray. So I got it even though I already owned the previous two movies. 5 stars all the way on price alone
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Take all your great movie fighting hero's and throw them into a situation to save the world and you have a good time shoot em up movie. I like the first Expendables and #2 is just as good although the plot is nothing to brag about. This is the movie for those of us who grew up on watching Sly,Arnold, Bruce save the day only this time they do it together as a group. Who cares that the plot kind of sucks and it makes no sense at times at how many times they can shoot their gun without reloading. Its kind of like watching Call of Duty with your favorite movie characters and setting ammo to unlimited.You can't possibly lose with those odds. Chuck Norris seemed out of place in the movie but he called himself the Lone Wolf so I guess it was appropriate.<br />I liked how they placed some mild humor into the fighting and it made sense if you watched any of these guys movies over the years. &#34;I'll Be Back&#34;  was classic Arnold. I don't think they should make a Expendables 3 that would be over kill.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A bit slower to get into the action than the first book but it definitely picks up and has a surprise ending.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is a fun book to read; it's so easy to get caught up in it- highly imaginative. I was surprised at the believability of the characters!
B00867GKIK|5.0|Another Disney classic and a must own for any one who loves everything that is Disney. The 3D is a great add feature and dont take away from the movie as most 3D movies seem so gimmicky and not needed.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I hate to say it,, but I love Kristen Stewart, other than being beautiful, she is a damned fine actress, as were all involved in this movie. I truly enjoyed it, the videography was as good as it gets and it was all simply a perfect package. Great movie is an understatement, I am not certain why it didn't receive as much publicity upon first being brought out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|While the characters were terribly flawed as human beings, you could not stop reading the book to see what turns the plot would take.  Was a really good read.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Can't say enough good things about Rodriguez. What a shame he only now is recognized in his home country. He should become a household name.
B008518MOW|5.0|If you,re a fan of Will Smith and the MIB series this is a must own. This movie really ties Jays and K's life together perfectly. And  if you own a 3D TV (really who in this day in age dont) this will be a great addition to your collection of 3D Blu rays.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Really like this game. It is great for practicing simple logic--it is very addicting and you can pick up anywhere and play! This is a fun app!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have had so much fun with this story line.  I would easily have paid triple the price for this app. The graphics on my KFHD are spectacular! I truly feel like I am a detective in this story.  I just can't seem to put my Kindle down!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I love his edgy music. He finally is getting the recognition he deserved many years ago. Great instrumentals, too - good for walking, jogging, listening to lyrics.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|I already owned the blu-ray version and got the 3D version N E ways. I know a lot of people out there hate on Mr Smith, and thought this movie was lame and I couldn't argue with you. But hey I like Will and this was one of his ok movies for me and 3D made it a must own for me.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This Dr. is certainly multi talented and has written the first book on this subject that held my interest. An excellent story teller<br />making facts interesting as well. Hat is off to Dr. Alexander.  the descriptive words used to explain a difficult subject were right on.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|The only thing I don't like about the Kindle Facebook app is the main news feed only partially loads. It shows the top few stories, and then the rest are like, thumbnail versions or something. Other than that, everything is good.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed how the story unfolded as told by both characters with the retelling and Amy's diary. I am only 75% into it.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|mc4 is a big difference from mc3.  my only issues so far are when you are low ranked side balancing doesn't seem to work well in all modes.  many times I was stuck fighting level 30-50 players at level 5.  don't stand a chance.  they should work on limiting what levels can play eachother
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This cd, along with the two others I have now ordered makes me serene and happy...They sothe me for sleep or first thing in the morning or when Im traveling!!  Very enjoyable music!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have very strong faith. I have for as long as I can remember. And this is the coolest Bible I have ever seen. I can get tons of different versions, NIV, KJV, ESV, all that stuff. Great, great app.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I didn't want to like this album. In fact, I was ashamed for even purchasing it. There as no way I was going to like anybody from American Idol. I draw the line at Kelly Clarkson. There hasn't been a winner since who I actually believed it.That is until now. Phillip Phillips can best be described as an amazing beautiful baby brought into the world by Dave Matthews and Jason Mraz. He knows how to capture the essence of love in the most beautiful possible way. This album will be in permanent rotation for the year.
0345529057|4.0|You can't beat this item for the price.  I haven't run into the issues of pages missing or being out of order, but I'm only one book into the series, so time will tell.<br /><br />The font is small though, have good eyes or good glasses.
0446580848|4.0|Great read, then leaves the reader without an ending after developing Several miniplots during the book. I felt like the whole last chapter was rushed thru for printing, as if it were going to miss a printing deadline.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is strangely addictive. And I can't help but make Bruce Lee type noises when I play it. YAH! HI-YA! WAH!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the program.  However, I thought I could access all the episodes of Season 3 of Downton Abbey.  Amazon apparently sells the DVD for Season 3.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I bought this to try on my old Bose Sound Dock. This was the original Sound Dock that worked with my older iPod but, when I got the iPod Touch it just said \\"Charging is not supported with this accessory.\\" The dockStubz worked perfectly. I can now once again listen to my music through the Bose Sound Dock.
B001HN6918|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 was a Christmas gift for a child.  The children loved the movie and have watched it over and over.

B005CA4SJW|5.0|A good price on this one. Plenty of undeads getting killed. Great entertainment. Your guide to survival among the walking dead.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Great read - starts fast and keeps moving - great foundation for future stories.  I have always enjoyed this series and this book does not disappoint.
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This is a fun game but it freezes up a lot and you lose some of your progress and must repeat some of your accomplishments. It's also too easy to accidentally spend your medals.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|I discovered this game on my Droid 2. I now have it on my Droid 3 and now, my Kindle. I can't get enough.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|If I could only have one study bible, this is the one to own. Easy navigation. If you are a Christian thirsting for knowledge, get this for your Kindle. A great price, too. This is a great companion to my Kindle HCSB study bible.
B0090SI42Y|2.0|I am a huge kung fu, Wutang, and Tarantino fan. The plot of this film is just awful. The action sequences are hard to follow. The characters and the acting are bad and unrealistic. This film falls short in pretty much every avenue, even the editing and the music were bad. I gave it an extra star for some satisfying moments, but overall it was terrible.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Right from the start it hooked me.  It's a totally fun and creative game.  I haven't had any problems with the app.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is great. I play it regularly before I go to bed. It's like giving my brain a work out.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|Horribly boring story line and way too much story.  Needs more brain work to do instead of listing to these chatty characters blab on and on and on.  Good graphics though and very colorful screen shots.
B000MQPU7U|5.0|A realistic movie about male friendship and tragic love.  it a movie that will stand the test of time. It has  a great plot. i already had the VHS Tape version.  I wanted a digital version for my computer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is to mojang I think the app is great and all but it is missing something to make this game more worth ur while u should make an update for the app and what i mean is by making it a little more like the pc and xbox version cause in creative mode i found i could not blow up tnt AND one thing we the fans would probably like is if u made the maps bigger and like in the xbox.version put houses and have a couple things already built. And here is something for the xbox alot of people including me dont have or cannot get xbox live so if its possible could u make card's specifically for us people to get the game for our xbox like a little update is what im trying to say. Ill have more opinions and advice in the future thank u
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I tweet all the time. This app is the official twitter app from Twitter, and as far as I'm concerned, it's the best for twitter users.
B00942S4OY|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter for x-mas. She was so excited.  I have heard no other music since. She listens to this all the time. She is one happy girl.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Christmas gift for daughter. she loved it.  the cover was great and the picures !  good price for the set
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so interesting.  I enjoy the variety of the site so much.  I do have some trouble navigating the site, but that will just get better with practice.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|fun little game that keeps you trying for hours. fun for all ages. from 5 to 500 years old. good job
B004J64QSI|5.0|I was touched by the quality of the voices and the moved to tears numerous times by the emotion that these gifted people delivered. I came back and ordered more copies for my daughters and my sister. I have heard nothing but praise from them. If there were 10 stars to pick I would have done so for this product.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a great book. The only reason I did not give five states it was a little slow in places.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I play this game on my PC often, but it is more difficult to play on the small Kindle screen.  It is just something you must learn how to play in a different way.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Thought I would try since it was free and now I am hooked. Can't wait to play each morning when my coin count is at full regeneration.
0765325950|5.0|This is to balance out the bull crap 1 star reviews because babies couldn't read this on their Kindle.  I hate writing a review on something that I haven't even read...but the overwhelming amount of 1 stars from people doing just that requires me to respond in kind.<br /><br />Good day.
0634086782|5.0|It's a great book for all levels of musicians. It covers essential material to better oneself. Definitely worth more than the price.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|My kids think this is the greatest game ever.  I play for awhile, but don't seem to have the intensity for it like the younger generation.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|From the first second I finished the first chapter I was hooked. It drew me in wanting to know what was going to happen and if he would find her. Absolutely great book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I chose this rating because of the personal political bashing that the author has taken. The story would have been more authentic had he left out the Obama bashing. As a U.S. citizen i learned many things about the workings and processes of the Navy Seals. I just hope people who may want to harm us and our country did not read this book and learn some of the things that I learned. Knowledge is power.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It was a great movie, and a great holiday gift to give. Love the purchase.  Thanks I am very pleased
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|The author lays out his thesis in the first chapter.  Then the remainder of the book is providing examples of one nation after another and explaining what initially appears to be exceptions.  This is a comprehensive and well written book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very interesting and it really kept me reading. I will consider reading the other titles in this series.
143911000X|5.0|I gave this item a rating of five because of the reaction I received from the person I gifted this to.<br />This product is very difficult to find so when I discovered the book was on amazon, I was in shock!<br />Thank you amazon for caring this book.

B0072A3OGS|5.0|Bought this for my son, at his request.  He loves this group and says it's an excellent CD.  Product wise it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  As for the actual music you will have to trust my son's opinion :)
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's voice is so beautiful and love the collection of songs.  This is much better than her last one. My kids loved it too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is such a great story, told with many details and twists that I couldn't stop reading... and I'm not much of a reader. I laughed, was shocked and cried... it's a beautiful story. Can't wait to read more!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is quite unremarkable how sparks can keep your attention! I absolutely loved it! I just might read it again!!! :)
B005721W9O|5.0|Even though this movie is old, it is still funny.  Tim Allen is still a great comedic actor!  The film is also appropriate for the family.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!!  Twists and turns were surprising and interesting.  I've recommended this book to so many people, and they have all agreed.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I found that it was easy to use and fast.  Since I play Solitaire on the computer I found that this was even easier. I know that I will use it often especially while in a waiting room or at the airport.

B006O6F932|4.0|Not of great quality...kind of leans when set up.  My daughter adores it!  Played with it all Christmas day...made it worth the cost.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Another GREAT book by Philippa Gregory!  Loved this, and I'm searching for other books by her that I have missed.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|In 1978 Enzo Castellano made a movie called Inglorious Bastards. In 1968 Sergio Leone made a paen to Westerns, called Once upon a Time in the West. In that same year, McLaglen made The Devil's Brigade. In 1960 John Wayne made The Alamo. These are a good enough start if you desire something approaching a full appreciation of Tarantino's sixth film, Inglorious Basterds.<br /><br />Tarantino changes spellings as a veil: here he is using an \\"e\\". He uses Enzo as himself in a cameo. The opening score is nothing less than \\"The Green Fields of Summer\\", of John Wayne's own version of \\"The Alamo\\". It is used to great effect against the wide screen, black background and yellow block font. We are now framed for action.<br /><br />The opening script announces two things: Firstly, we are only in a fairy tale, albeit one from the Brothers Grimm. \\"Once upon a time\\"... it begins, as does many a tale. Secondly, this opening script moves quickly to the little house on the prairie where Leone did his homage to (at least twelve) American Westerns. We see a father and his children with a menacing intrusion in gray; rats in the milk again, but motorized. The Nazi Colonel allows one Jew to escape. She foreshadows, more like mirrors, the habit of the Tennessee Lieutenant who release a lone Nazi, granted life to broadcast and to amplify the infamy of the Apache Resistance.<br /><br />We are not in a World War II movie, not yet. We are in the Western for the first two of the five chapters of classical dramatic form. The music is now that of Sergio Leone's faithful composer, Ennio Morricone. The stark guitar is his trademark spaghetti western of Clint Eastwood's journeyman years. What do we hear but the unmistakable quotations from Beethoven's Fur Elise in a second theme. Not bad at all.  But he does have Brad Pitt as Lieutenant. Aldo Raine, which is a more or less thinly veiled reference to Aldo Ray for his movies like Battle Cry.  My last memory of him is in one of the last of the John Wayne movies, The Green Berets. He is either Muldoon or McDaniel; they are hard to keep straight.  In another direction, Tarantino found that German actors, good as they are, had real trouble coping with his writing style.  It is unnatural and written for poetic effect in phrasing and cadence.  He found a fine Viennese actor, Christoph Waltz, to play Colonel Landa.<br /><br />So Morricone and his \\"Dopo La Condenna\\", from the 1954 \\"Battle of Algiers\\", is the music for us to meet the Apache Resistance. The American Lieutenant sports a big red flint knap shoulder patch of the infamous Devil's Brigade. They were the First Special Service Force, formed from the superbly trained Canadian-American Commandos. This man is no slouch. Soon, you see the Bear Jew, Apache style, using his baseball bat as a war club to pound his enemy into bony jelly, as happened to Custer's savage crew. Boots are yanked off as a further indignity, true to history. Scalping is depicted in a relatively dainty fashion.<br /><br />By Chapter three, we have left Tarantino's Western homage behind to focus on the movies of Europe in those days. First we see the marquee in Paris being stripped of Leni Riefenstahl. Leni was Hitler's darling and the only one Goebels could not get around. Later, we are treated to one of the best Hitler impersonations you will ever see. Then we see WB Pabst (the joke here is that Pabst was a German director who fled to Warner Brothers when Hitler popped up). And Pierre Fresnay film \\"L'assassin Habile ... au 21\\" about a serial killer, as Tarantino is never, ever heavy-handed in telegraphing where he is going. Mike Meyers cartoons for us the classic British wry senior officer in the map room briefing the cocky young pup as Churchill looks on.<br /><br />Operation Kino unifies the Basterds with the little girl who escaped in the fairy tale climax. We are in yet another Tarantino time warp as Kino was founded in 1977, and had the good sense to make available to our scrappy writer/director many of the films that formed his cinematic sensibilities with the great catalogues of classic European film. From here on, we are in a new homage, this one to the great WWII films of the 1960's. Pulp Fiction stars Harvey Keitel appears as the disembodied voice on the phone at the end, while Samuel L. Jackson narrates. That is as far as I can take you. I leave you baited for a deliciously trademark Tarantino moment of absurdity: Hitler asks one of his guards for a stick of gum.ector many of the films that formed his cinematic sensibilities with the great catalogues of classic European film.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me, and when I finally decided to read it, I couldn't put it down. I felt like I could really relate to Charlie even though I have never experienced the sane things. A must read!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so glad I read this trilogy! I could hardly put it down. Can't wait for the movies to come out!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I must say, it has been a challenge finding a good PNR series, when comparing to such as BDB, IAD, Guardians of the Underworld, etc. But HOLY TOLEDO, BATMAN!! I was hooked to Dragon Bound and the Elder Races Series from the first couple of chapters.<br /><br />Ms. Harrison's writing style is descriptive, while being engaging; it flows easily through each scene and chapter with a smoothness that doesn't just draw you in, so much as seduce you into feeling everything that the characters are feeling. The plot line is exciting, there's tons of edge-of-your-seat action, scenes sensual enough that my husband looked at me funny and asked \\"Why are you breathing so weird?\\", an uber-alpha Elder that made my toes curl, and a heroine that I fell in love with.<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to getting the rest of the books in this series. If they are anything like this one, Ms. Harrison just joined JR Ward, Kresley Cole, Gena Showalter and a few select others as a favorite in \\"My Book.\\"
B007OTZ654|5.0|A remastered Ziggy Stardust finally done right. It sounds great. I'm not sure what took the label so long to get it right, this is not rocket science.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|I didn't really think it was as great. I felt no emotion whatsoever throughout the novel but I liked the plot. Chris McCandless life is interesting and his journey is quite ironic.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Mamma Mia the movie was great I've looked at it several times and went and seen it on broadway. Love it
B0084HJE0S|3.0|This is really just an overview.  Not much else but since it was free I cannot knock it too much
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book with a horrific and  compelling story.  Rich in detail, and multi layered, with an authenticity that can come only from the witness's point of view.  It is one of the best books I have read in a long time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As a fellow traveler or Dr Alexander, having had an NDE when I was 17, I appreciate both the story he tells and his struggles to tell it.  This is a beautiful, heartwarming book I recommend to all.

B0052CK5PQ|4.0|I love the way Caitlin Moran used the experiences of her life to express the importance of feminism. I laughed out loud in various spots and many points resonated with me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Get past the first 75 pages ( if you have any question) then you will be on the edge of your seat until the end of the book.  Cleverly written this book is a master piece of suspense and an intricate weaving of events.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This novel was diverting; it held my attention for the few days I was reading it, but I had a hard time believing in it fully.  It was as if the author couldn't decide between writing a novel about a girl who's a spy and a spy novel--a piece of genre fiction with its own rules for credibility and immediacy.  I couldn't like it too much as a spy novel:  there wasn't enough suspense and not enough at stake, really, for the narrator/protagonist.  And I couldn't like it too much as a novel because I couldn't sufficiently believe in the narrator.  I'm not English, but still I doubt there's a woman who only thinks of her father as The Bishop.  On the other hand, Ian McEwan's a fine writer; the narrator's voice was otherwise natural and idiomatic.  I liked hearing about her romantic and sexual encounters from a believable, intelligent woman.  But I didn't buy everything she said and didn't say about the men she met and how she felt about them.  I'll be glad when Ian McEwan goes back to realistic fiction.
B0012NO316|3.0|God, I love them both...iconic & magnetic....their attraction & their tempestuousity! So, I ordered this thing...I was bored and the night facing me was as long and bleak as a midwest trainride under cover of darkness (having never been on a train in the midwest, i am only guessing here...)...I get the feeling that really this was just Dick and Liz doing their thing. There was a comfort-zone here that had me feeling like a trespasser...like this was them. The film left me feeling soiled on a spiritual level....twas an interesting storyline that was probably a pioneering effort in it's day...yet, here it failed, it frayed, it uncoiled & the energies of both she and he, which should have ebbed & abated, were just a messy force of modernistic acting for their time period.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|I am so delighted with the camera.  I got it for my 9 year old grandson and since he is such a LEGO lover this was just &#34;over the top&#34;.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I appreciate having. the option of choosing how I will use my available battery time. This APP is a great idea;<br />THANKYOU
B006QQQ5SI|5.0|We watched this with our two boys, aged 11 and 8. They found the story line funny and compelling. The scenery is great and if you or anyone has an interest in birds, there's  lots of great shots of rare species throughout.
B0090EHVMC|1.0|My son ordered this one for my grandson...this shameful remake is an abomination! If you liked The Grinch remake, you'll love the new Lorax. If you are completely bewildered as to why anyone would touch and alter perfection, you will be as appalled as I was...it is akin to turning Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue into a rap song.<br />Grody man, grody.
B0069P0DU2|5.0|My brother had this on his wish list for Christmas. He's a huge Star Wars fan. Easy enough gift that I know he wants.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I love the family dinamics in this trilogy. I can't wait to read the final book. I hope it is not too far off.
0765325950|1.0|I'd pay the full price but I want my digital version! What where they thinking?  I guess il. Just wait.
1419705849|5.0|My 10 year old daughter loves this series she read it Christmas Day.  Wish i could trade them in for the next copy.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Good action and reasonable effects for a Sci Fi flick. Seemed like the &#34;I Robot&#34; movie was an influence in this version.<br /><br />There are better movies out there and a lot worse. But for light entertainment this was not bad.
B007HO392S|5.0|This is my favorite of all her cds! There are some 'dark' songs on there compared to her other albums and its great to see her branching out!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is so intriguing and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. You will not put it down until you reach the end.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|Awesome very addicting game.  I play it on my Motorazr and my Kindle fire.  It glitches a bit on my Kindle and will shut down every once in a while but nothing drastic
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Good acting and lots of action. A good bad guy makes any movie where there is a &#34;good vs evil&#34; thing going on better and this film had this.  Downey was good in the role of Sherlock again.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Loved Adam's new Cd. He is such a talented singer. He's doing pretty good for not winning Idol. Now he needs to travel with Queen in the USA.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is not only a superb show but amazon has done a fantastic job at brining it to those of us that want to watch it on our ipads.
B003BD236C|5.0|Tense, believable, well acted tale of the Cold War and failure of a highly complicated computerized system. Henry Fonda's great.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|This film could have been much better. The story line seemed a little simple and the acting was not the best.
B009O36EO0|5.0|From the moment I first heard a live performance of \\"In My Head\\" on YouTube, it was love at first listen! I had to find more and I was so pleased to find that her entire debut album is just as fantastic with very few weak links. This CD will now be overplayed in my home, office and car until I burn myself out on it. Right now the track \\"Sidewalk\\" is on bloody repeat. haha I'm officially obsessed with both her and her music. Hopefully this gets a stateside release soon so that my fellow countrymen can truly know what an amazing, natural vocal talent sounds like! Buy this now and additional copies for every friend and family member!!
B008J34466|3.0|Oh, Pink....I had such high hopes for your latest album! With all that's gone on in your life over the last few years, I was sure you were really going to open up and take things to the next level. Instead, we get a schizophrenic hodge-podge that, much like 2003's TRY THIS, is much more about image over content.<br />  And that image is really starting to wear thin, looking like last night's make-up in the harsh morning glare. Instead of a maturing woman who's coming into her own as a wife, mother and artist, we have someone who's straddling the fence between vacuous party girl, romantic mess and casual observer of life.<br />  The biggest disappointment is the whole good-time girl image. Amid casual hook-ups, one night stands and drunken pick-ups, Pink just goes her merry way, sounding sillier and sadder as she dances along. What may have worked ~ and even been cute! ~ in her 20's is looking more and more pathetic now that she's in her 30's. Where, oh, where, is the woman/artist who wrote \\"Dear Mr. President\\", \\"Sober\\" and \\"Glitter In The Air?\\" Pretty much nowhere to be found on THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE, that's for sure! In fact, as much as it pains me to say it, Pink has devolved into the very thing she rallied against on 2006's I'M NOT DEAD....one of those \\"Stupid Girls.\\" And that's beyond sad.<br />  Things start off with the bloated, busy \\"Are We All We Are.\\" An album needs a great \\"Wow!\\" moment to kick things off....\\"Are We All We Are\\" is NOT that moment.<br />  Far better is the first single, \\"Blow Me (One Last Kiss).\\" A tight arrangement, powerful vocal and smart lyrics (\\"White knuckles/And sweaty palms from hangin' on too tight\\") all come together here. Now, if only things had blossomed from here....!<br />  \\"Try\\" is a step in the right direction. Pink shows a real honesty and vulnerability here, stripping herself of all pretense. Add a killer vocal to the mix and you have one of TRUTH's true stand out cuts.<br />  Almost as strong is \\"Just Give Me A Reason\\", but there's something about the arrangement that just seems...rehashed. Maybe if they had just stuck with the basic piano/bass/strings. Nice enough, though.<br />  There's also a \\"been-there-done-that\\" vibe to much of \\"True Love\\", but the song is so dang infectious, well, you end up not caring! (I love the little vocal flourishes, from the whispered \\"romance\\" to the giddy \\"You can do it babe!\\").<br />  \\"How Come You're Not Here\\" is one of those cuts that just rings false...and repeatative. O.K., we get it...the relationship has it's ups and downs ~ what relationship doesn't?!? Add an arrangement that sounds like Pink is TRYING to rock, and you have a real misfire.<br />  Even worse is \\"Slut Like You.\\" As I said earlier, this kind of silly, pointless waste of time may have worked five years ago, but now? The less said, the better. (If it had even been done tongue in cheek...!).<br />  Things do a 180 and completely rebound with the disc's killer title track. \\"The Truth About Love\\" has it all...humor, insight, emotion, tight instrumentation, an amazing lead vocal....and hand claps! THIS is the Pink I want to hear more of!<br />  Ditto \\"Beam Me Up.\\" Pink is one of the few new singers of the past decade or so who's voice can stand on it's own...I would have loved to have seen it backed by just the acoustic guitar here. But between the strong lyrics and spot-on vocal, this one is still a winner.<br />  Certainly not as pointless as \\"Slut Like You\\" (but nowhere near as worthwhile as \\"Try\\" \\"The Truth About Love\\" or \\"Beam Me Up\\"!), \\"Walk Of Shame\\" is, ultimately, a miss. Fun arrangement, though....shame it couldn't have been used on some stronger lyrical content.<br />  \\"Here Comes The Weekend\\" is just a noisy misstep that's trying too hard to be \\"hip\\" and \\"current\\" for it's own good. This is like Madonna trying to act like she's still one of the cool kids! And don't even get me started on how out of place Eminem sounds here! Ugh!!!<br />  The slump continues with \\"Where DidThe Beat Go?\\", which drones on and on and....! This isn't Pink....this is a desperate attempt at Rhianna/Beyonce/Fill In The Blank dance/pop radio-friendly pabulum. Another major low point for the disc.<br />  The standard disc wraps up with the gorgeous \\"The Great Escape.\\" Pink would be wise to work with co-writer and producer Dan Wilson again in the future...there's a grace and maturity here that is just stunning. THIS is what Pink the Artist is all about, versus Pink the Caricature. Abso-frickin'-lutely brilliant!<br />  The four tracks on the deluxe edition are just as strong, and could have EASILY replaced four of the weaker cuts off of the standard version. (Are they worth the $30.00+ that's being asked elsewhere?? Um..in a word, no).<br />  \\"My Signature Move\\" has a great doo-wop-meets-rock groove to it. Equal parts heart and humor, this cut is just a joy!<br />  There's a simple beauty to \\" Is This Thing On\\" that's both gut-wrenching AND intoxicating. This is REAL....this MATTERS. Once again...brilliant.<br />  But the disc's true core and heart is \\"Run.\\" The only song that overtly addresses her new role as Willow's Mom, Pink lays her emotions bare here, and we're all the better for it.<br />  \\"Good Old Days\\" wraps things up on an upbeat, positive note. Reflective and wise, this is a sweet little gem, as well as the perfect way to close things out.<br />  But that's one of the things that makes this all so sad....if the four bonus tracks had replaced, say, \\"Slut Like You\\", \\"Walk Of Shame\\", \\"Here Comes The Weekend\\" and \\"Where Did The Beat Go?\\", this would have been an absolute winner, a four, maybe even a five, star disc!<br />  Now, in closing...to all the Pink fan-atics who are going to jump on me (and this review) for hating on Pink...nothing could be further from the truth. I truly think she's one of the two or three most important artists to arrive on the music scene in the last decade. Truth be told, I think she could be the Carole King/Carly Simon/Stevie Nicks/Chrissie Hynde of her generation (Maturing doesn't mean not being rowdy and still rocking! Even in the liner notes, Pink herself says the old Pink is getting smaller and smaller all the time). Unfortunately, much of THE TRUTH ABOUT LOVE casts her more as a musical version of Lyndsey Lohan. And I find that unacceptable. Talent this great shouldn't be wasted.<br />  (As with all my reviews, I'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics. However, I'm also docking it half a star for only offering the deluxe version through one retailer).The Beat Go?\\", which drones on and on and....!

0765325950|3.0|I am really disappointed from the marketing decision of TOR to delay the ebook 4 months. This review is for the paper-only launch. I am not giving my money for paper anymore as I carry my books on my iPad. It's 2013 and ebook surpass the paper sales!!! I'm willing to give my $20 for the digital book (which makes MORE PROFIT FOR THE PUBLISHER), but it isn't there. Stupid or greedy?<br /><br />——————— Review Update ———————<br /><br />After reading the book, quite a while AFTER getting the e-book, I'd say it is a decent book that provides closure on the saga. It is not the way the previous books ended, or the general dynamics of the saga was going for. Somewhat flat or feeling of a &#34;rushed&#34; ending, just because we had to end the story. Anti-climactic in a sense.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was good. It's not a book I would pay full price for but it was good. Definitely something different.

B00340ESIS|3.0|Like all books written on the subject, this book has a dogmatic approach to storytelling that will repel some people.<br />However, it also contains useful hints and anecdotes that may help you craft a well paced story.<br />It's not quite as deep and philosophical as Campbell or McKee...but it's also way easier and a lot more fun to read.<br /><br />Buy it, read it, forget it.<br /><br />What you will remember of it when you write your story is what's important.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite movies, and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two extraordinary actors. The five star rating tells the truth, you are pretty much guaranteed to love this movie. Don't hesitate to purchase and watch now!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started out with just book 1 because I was collecting a bunch of free books. I read the first few pages and it seemed a bit confusing at first, so I set it aside for another time.<br /><br />When I finally decided to read further, I was thrust into this mysterious post apocalyptic world with characters that felt so real and constantly questioned their actions and weighed the different choices they had. The mystery and suspense of the first book kept me glued to the pages, and the ending was so amazing that I immediately went on to purchase the entire 1-5 series.<br /><br />The second book was a bit different from the first book, in that I felt its pacing slow down and it contained less action. It was still interesting in the sense that it set the mood of what it must be like to live in the silo, and it still had some interesting bits, but as a whole, this book didn't stand out as much as the others.<br /><br />The third book starts to pick up the action as the main character tries to unravel the truth. The author uses an interesting technique here where the reader already knows the answer to most of the questions being asked, since they were presented in the first book. I thought that this was making the book anti-climactic because I knew what was going to happen next, and sometimes it did, but other times, there would be an unexpected twist that shocked me and forced me to continue reading. It also helped convey the message of how restrictive information was because you witness how the past's information is lost and everything has to be relearned.<br /><br />The fourth and fifth books are just full of action. The story splits up and gets told from three different perspectives, each time ending with a cliffhanger. Every time I got to one of these cliffhangers, I wanted so badly to know what was going to happen next, and didn't care about this other story going on, until I realized that this other story would eventually merge into the larger storyline. These last two books were full of suspense, mystery, anticipation, and fear and just had me staying up, wanting to know how everything would end. I've never experienced that level of attachment from any other book.<br /><br />To wrap it up, I'm so happy to have found this series. It really deserves all these 5-star reviews because the writing is superb. I don't know what else to say other than it's an amazing book that I will remember for a long time and that it gets my highest recommendation.wo books were full of suspense, mystery, anticipation, and fear and just had me staying up, wanting to know how everything would end.

B00355L2TU|5.0|Her goal is to get you off the coach and get your butt in gear! She succeeded. Note: You may shed a tear! Lol
0765325950|5.0|Ignore all the whiny nerds complaining about the lack of an ebook on release, it's an inconvenience to some to be sure, but I feel they're doing a disservice to the book by giving it a poor review. This book is extremely good, and ties up the series nicely. I'm sure all WoT fans would've preferred to have Jordan pen the final volumes, but Sanderson did an admirable job. There are some turns of phrase by characters which seem off, and not nearly as much detail as Jordan may have included, but overall I'm not sure any other author could have done better.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I felt like I had a dysfunctional relationship with this book....it was so good and held my attention so much that I could not put it down! Great romance, I totally recommend this book.
B009CGGOT4|5.0|I love Russell Crowe movies and this one is right up there with his best. The Amazon prime viewership is fantastic; bottom line this is a great buy!!
034580404X|4.0|Well, it's exactly what you have heard about it. It's interesting to say the least. I would recommend this set vs buying each book individually.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this show!  The acting is really well done and the period costumes are to die for!  It sweeps you back into the early 1900's. Streaming by Amazon was excellent.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Small enough to take anywhere with you. Nice that it stands up so you don't have to hold it!! I want to buy one for my mom!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Young and old can appreciate Ender's personal doubts and fear. In his ability to triumph I found inspiration. Feel his pain and celebrate his victories...read Ender's Game!!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|Great artist, another great album! Fast shipping and a great price. What more could you ask for? I'm very pleased with my purchase.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Well presented, collector's item, good value. One of a kind. We will treasure this item for a long time with many hours of enjoyable viewing.
B002M9WW30|4.0|Got this on sale for $20 during the holidays and I'm glad I did. I went on a Rocky marathon and watched all the films in a few days. The transfers are pretty decent for the second half of the movies but the first half is not so great. Once you get around to Rocky III the video and sound start to improve slightly and Rocky Balboa is the best looking and sounding of the bunch.<br /><br />I've seen worse transfers out there so I can't complain too much considering how old some of the movies are. Not to mention, even at $40 you are still getting 6 fantastic movies on Blu-ray which is a steal if you think about it.<br /><br />If you are a boxing fan you can't go wrong with Rocky: The Undisputed Collection.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am completely hooked on this show and cannot wait for the next season to begin! Every episode leaves you wanting more'
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game. Recommended to many of my friends. Will certainly purchase the full version soon. Gonna try the Disney Brave Temple Run soon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is the best game to play when you have time on your hands,like at the doctors office or waiting for the train
B005QUQP76|5.0|I've owned the Corsair M60 mouse for about 8 months now and it's just been fantastic. I have more of a claw grip and I went through tons and tons of mice because they just never felt quite right in my hand. The M60 feels like it was made just for my hand the way it fits it perfectly. This is a very solid mouse and I would definitely buy another one if it was to break on me tomorrow!<br /><br />I love Corsair products and this is just another great product from them.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This story was beautifully woven, moving back and forth in time.  It provided an accurate history of the times.  Well worth the read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Read the book in two days, could not put it down.  Loved it.  Colleen Hoover is a great author.  Can't wait till her next book!
B004R13U6Y|1.0|This app forces me to login to the Amazon app store before it starts to open. In the middle of trying to get a document read, I'm forced to login to the Amazon store. I'm probably un installing it as it has no place on MY phone, I paid for it . Amazon did not.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loveeee Colleen's writing!!<br />Beautifully done!! already reading all her books!!<br />Can't wait for more of her books!!<br />Need to read!!
0765325950|5.0|Anyone who has followed this series will love this ending. Its a must read for every fan. I started in 2000, so its been 13 years for me, which has been about half of my life. This is probably the best fantasy series ever written. Thank you Robert Jordan for an epic series! Thank you Brandon Sanderson for taking on this huge project and treating it like it was your own. ANYONE who is giving it one 1 star for not having an e-book is WRONG! The review is FOR THE PLOT NOT FORMAT!
0345803493|5.0|If you can get passed all the xxx rated stuff. This book really has a great story line!<br />Christain Grey an Ana Steele never fail in keeping you wondering ;)
B0038KHTGC|4.0|First off, the CD was great and the actual disc was brand new. But the CD was conditioned as &#34;New&#34; and &#34;Factory Sealed&#34; yet when I got it, the CD case was cracked and the cover fell off. A little misleading, but at least the actual disc was brand new and without a crack. Perfect for the price, but not meant for a collection.
0061122416|5.0|The Alchemist should be read by everybody that at one point in their life looked at the sky<br />and wondered if there is more to life. This book helps you remember all the things<br />that you already know deep down about life, about yourself and your destiny. And it gives<br />you the courage to take that path you were meant to take. And when you do that all the Universe helps you:)<br />Thank you PAULO. You are an inspiration.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Saw it in the theater as well.  Don't normally watch movies twice especially in the same year.  This film was funny,<br />poignant, well acted & colorful (truly eye popping colorful).  Will watch it again.  Also, a great film in you have<br />lived in a foreign country or plan on retiring to one.  Definitely recommend it for future expats.
0765325950|1.0|Boo to the publishers that decided to delay the e-book. I take satisfaction knowing that there are a number of us who will deny you the additional profit you sought. Not that I wouldn't have bought it immediately in Kindle version - I would. But this is just bullying the series' loyal fans. One star in protest!
B0086700CM|5.0|Love it...<br />it's exciting and relaxing and challenging at the same time!!! Its really a lot of fun fun fun fun
B009VB97EY|1.0|I didn't care for this movie at all. I turned it off after about 30 minutes. Channing Tatum was so handsome but I just didn't like the movie.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Nothing too exciting to say about this other than my husband wanted it for Christmas and I got it for him. The price was right and it came quicky.
1423389263|5.0|Great start to a series and left me wanting more. PATRICK ROTHFUSS...when will you get the 3rd book out, I am waiting?
0765325950|1.0|I'm going to be honest, I'm not paying for the book now. I will most certainly read it, but I will not be buying it. Failing to release the ebook on the same day was a terrible decision. The really sad thing is, I would have paid cover price for the ebook which in the end would have saved TOR the price of printing.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie but i love all things Jane Austin. It was light hearted and sweet. I will watch it again.
1419835491|5.0|Purchased this to watch while I run on the treadmill. The series itself is enjoyable, but the boxed set really completes it! Well organized, well made, quality products through and through!
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|except doing exercises alone after looking at photos of the proper form, these are videos that show the moves so they are<br />easy to understand and copy. It &#34;feels&#34; like you have an exercise buddy.
B009AOFNU4|3.0|I've owned many steelseries products in the past and was never really impressed with their quality and even less impressed by their buggy software but I stuck with it because I was a zboard addict for so long, still cant play a FPS with anything that doesn't have butterfly keys on the PC.<br /><br />Now on to the pad........the first thing your gonna think when you open it is \\"I paid how much for this?\\"  Yes, it's pretty small, I'm only 5'4\\" and a pretty small guy, I feel like a giant with this thing, it gets pretty uncomfortable after about 10-15 minutes of knocking your knuckles together......I don't really think this was designed with adults in mind, I know it's portable but this is just so small.<br /><br /> The construction and build quality is surprisingly solid for a steel-series product, but then again their build quality faults usually don't start showing their face until you spend a good 50 hours with a product so much remains to be seen. The software was a shocking surprise as well.....it all worked correctly,both the windows software and the android, even dare I say felt \\"polished\\", another first for a steel series product. I just don't understand how they have justified the price, I believe it's simply because it's a niche' market and they know they can charge whatever they want.<br /><br /> That being said i bought it at $68.......still about 2x too much, $49 should be top of the line retail on this. I cant fault the controller, the buttons feel nice and solid, the analog sticks.....meh......no better quality than some knock off PS2 controller but far better than any other \\"android\\" pad, worse quality than a PSP's sticks though. All in all it's a great pad, better than most.......but it's priced twice as much as it should be and I don't think many people will be willing to overlook the tag.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|i thought MIB3 was as good as MIB1. I didn't really care for 2. I will always watch it when it is on.
B0039P1O4O|5.0|I'm a fan of the super tooth buddy! I've owned a super tooth in the past. The model that I used to own was an older version, but very similar to the super tooth 3.  Almost similar in size.  What's great about this buddy version is it's a little bit smaller than the versions that I've mentioned.  Even better, a lot more slimmer in design.  Very comparable to the width of an iPhone.  Safe to say, just as light as an iPhone or even lighter!  If you've never owned a super tooth you'll be really surprised on how loud this thing is.  It's pretty loud. But, in a very good way.<br /><br /> Currently, I have an iPhone 4S.  Pairing my phone and the super tooth was beyond easy!  Once your phone and the super tooth is paired together, your IPhone's internal hands free speaker becomes irrelevant. Again, this thing loud.  Don't want to over exaggerate, but if you were sitting in a conference room with several co workers on a conference call, you could literally put this thing in the middle of the table, hold a meeting and the person on the other end would be able to practically hear everything via this Bluetooth speaker.  This thing is great!  Better yet, this thing picks up voices with no problems.  Somewhat of a bonus, Siri is a plus with this speaker phone.  For whatever reason, the super tooth enhances the volume and pick up pattern of your voice into the iPhone.  I've noticed that usually when you use Siri only via the iPhone's internal speaker, the little microphone icon pops up and you can see the volume measurement at half. It's usually at half unless you've got the phone directly close to your mouth and the input of the sound from your voice is then increased. With the super tooth buddy, the measured iPhone mic volume virtually is measured to the top almost all the time.<br /><br />If you're looking for great hands-free speaker, this is possibly the one for you.  Simple and design, lightweight, and inexpensive.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|This book was okay.  I wanted to like Connor and Megan as a couple, but they really didn't mesh all that well to me.  The chemistry just didn't seem all that strong.  The author did try to give them chemistry, but it missed the mark for me.  We really didn't get to know them all that well either.  We did get a glimpse into their background, but not that much.  I wish the author would have given us some insight into the wedding night.  We kept hearing about all these things they talked about, but we had no clue what it was.  What was it that made them get married?  Megans friends were annoying.  Either make them nicer and more supportive or give Megan a backbone to stand up to them.  Who needs friends like that?  I finished the book, but I probably will never read it again.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Another feel good movie from Clint that is ranks right up there with the others. It's a little predictable but to the point of &#34;oh well, you seen one you've seen them all&#34;..
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I truely enjoyed this book. Its descriptions are so vivid that one can easily imagine the characters and th setting.
0765325950|5.0|I don't know why people are pissing on Jordan's grave with one star reviews over a delayed e-book release.  Sad people, may the dark one's touch hit them in their privates.
B000B7QCKE|5.0|The Yanni Live at the Acropolis which showcases his many talents for conducting and writing music. This is one of the most entertaining concerts you will ever see. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of Yanni's music.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|This bluray is well worth the money. Watching this show in 1080p is like seeing it for the first time again. The higher resolution makes it a pleasure to watch on modern HDTV's. This season of the show is where it really comes into it's own, and sets the pace for the rest of the series. Despite what other reviewers have said about the quality of the remastering, I can honestly say that I have not noticed any serious faults in the quality of this season vs the season 1 bluray. In terms of entertainment, this season is so much better than the first that I am just happy to be able to watch these episodes in 1080p, and I hope season 3 doesn't take too much longer to remaster.<br /><br />Also, there are some great extra features included that should please lots of the serious fans.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|This movie was garbage, really disappointed in the entire thing.  A trailer park trash mystery and nothing more.  If you really have nothing to do, then by all means rent this, do not buy it.<br /><br />The scene where the guys head is being pounded in with a can of pumpkin pie filling was the best.  Pick another flick.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the vibrant colors in Free Flow.  Takes a few tries to get into the groove but then you can fly through until the next level.  Each level gets progressively harder so you are always faced with a challenge!
B008OOYALE|4.0|It's really fun. I like it. but you need a lot of gold. and you can't get any unless someone sends you gold
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|We have a Kindle Fire. My 5yo DD loves this game. Pets are cute and she likes the mini-games. However, the only ways to add bling (without ACTUAL $$) is to watch Ice Age trailer. There is a glitch and you can't collect the bling after you watch. You can collect hearts by visiting Dream town and friends. They'll give you 3 hearts when you collect items...per town, per day. but it would take FORVER collecting them this way, unless you have tons of \\"friends\\" to visit. So, it's a huge time waste and battery waster for me. She gets frustrated b/c she wants to go further, but I won't buy the bling. It's OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive! Boo!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I find this game to be very amusing and the free edition is fine. I get ads and x out of them, oh well. It's cool because it has so many levels to beat so it's worth it to download and play!
B00APUQH0W|3.0|When I first saw trailers for this movie I wouldn't wait to see it. However I wasn't prepared for how slow the beginning was, or how sad it was
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good version of the game. If you like the old Windows version this is as close as you're gonna get for a free up.
1401232590|5.0|The Long Halloween is a all around spectacular book set in Frank Miller's year one universe. This book is a seriously rich complex story about batman in his early years. The premise of the story is that batman is trying to take down the gotham city mafia. However the case turns into a murder mystery. Things get hairy when he finds that even his closest allies become suspects and that he can trust no one. Also the artist's style is quite unique. The way he uses shadowing is quite amazing. So if you like batman, pick this one up. While you are at it, get dark victory & haunted knight as well. The three book are worth every cent.
0765325950|1.0|Roberts widow must be living in the same world of Fanatasy if she thinks this is acceptable.  Guess I'll wait for a friend to finish reading theirs rather than purchasing it on ebook.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I started reading Pendergast character books years ago, they are great. I also read books written by both authors Preston and Child.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!<br />Exciting from the first page to the last one.<br />A story that shows people do can change to the better due to unconditional love.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book feels has if the guys (Preston and Child) were trying to get this book out fast. But, as way the book was good. I have read all of their books and will each time they put out a new!
B003G93ZCM|5.0|I once had the pleasure of meeting Gene Cernan and found him to be very approachable and knowledgable. This book conveys all of those qualities and more.
B008PZ69T8|2.0|I've read all three of the 50 Shades books and am amazed that this author got by with copying so many lines from the Twilight series.  These books are fashioned after Twilight, minus the vampire theme and of course the kinky sex.  Some of the lines are verbatim from Twilight.  Christian is Edward (hair color, eyes, protective nature, etc., etc.,), and the list goes on.  EL James got rich off copying Stephanie Meyers.  The main difference being these books are very poorly written.  I was so bored by the third book I just wanted it to end.  I'm amazed that so many young women are falling for this crap; looking for \\"Christian\\" in the men they are dating.  STOP RIGHT THERE because he doesn't exist.  This is pure fantasy at it's worst. Absolutely laughable!

B0019N8P2W|5.0|When I saw the entire run of this show was on sell, I had to buy this product. I love the main character (Daria's) sense of humor. It brings back great memories when this show along with many other cartoons were airing on MTV. A great show that ended so soon.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading howl's moving castle. I was a little surprised by it, since I had only seen the movie and that was awhile ago. Anyway. I thought this book was delightful. Worth the read.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Fantastic DVD! Put it on your large HD screen and crank up the sound system and enjoy! This DVD seems to capture the magic of Led Zeppelin's reunion. I think the only way to top watching this DVD would be actually being one of the on-stage cameramen who filmed it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Keeps you interested and makes you fill like you are going back in time.  For Stephen King fans the reference to past books like IT make it better.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|I hadn't seen this delightful movie since I was a child, and really couldn't remember much of it.  My wife recommended it, and after looking at the cast list, I couldn't wait to see it.  This was a  wonderful choice.  The plot isn't complicated, and the few special effects are simple and basic for the time.  Remember when movie budgets were spent on scripts instead of flashy effects?  That's what you get here.  Pure, entertaining plot and great acting.
B005M2V2K8|5.0|My kids like the big eyes on this one.  The product seems to be well made, and my kids have definitely played rough with them.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Overall good story. Definitely a feel good story from a dark past. The emotions run high throughout the characters and get a little rhetorical, however the message is a beautiful one...worth checking out!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I don't like how you have to earn extra colors and designs.  I takes too long. Fun to play with kids.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Finished this book so fast - could not put it down. Had a lot of ups and downs and I had no idea what was  coming next. Loved it
B000TBGEZK|5.0|One of the greatest records of all time from one of the greatest bands of all time.  A must have.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Simply beautiful, easy to read, it was really hard to put the book down, I enjoyed, never read anything from this author
B008NR8YXC|5.0|Andras Schiff 's Bach is an unequaled joy. It looses nothing when recorded and when heard live is mesmerizing. This is a genius that every classical music lover must see at least once.
1401224792|3.0|Werewolves is a stand-alone one-off of the Fables series--and it has all the problems that one-offs usually have: unlike the complexly plotted ongoing series there's just not much story here. I read it in about 15 minutes tops and the storyline is simple enough that I'll never bother to read it again.<br /><br />I did enjoy Bigby's character,as I always do, so it earned 3 stars.
B001OGRNH2|4.0|This album is quite adventurous and fun. A must have for all music listeners who enjoy pushing new boundaries! -J
B00756GKBA|5.0|I love it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|ignore the critics.  it's a melodramatic but that's what it's supposed to be. the story. the acting and the beautiful filming keeps you coming back.  can't wait for season 3.
B00AC8ZIXO|4.0|Love Anything Halo.....Basic prelude to the Halo 4 gaming console game. Starts off a little slow, but for a fan of the Halo series it is a must.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a great read. Couldn't put it down! Keep tissues near by, you will most definitely be needing them!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The most analytical investigator mind I have ever witnessed.  Gathering clues others missed, he identifies the perps and pursues them when they are safely beyond the reach of the justice system.  Violent only when provoked, he warns before striking.  I think he is most people's definition of a real man.  He makes James Bond look like a wuss and most crime scene detectives like they need a seeing eye dog. Reacher should be be Attorney General of the United States.
0316069434|5.0|In the great style of Michael Connelly, this is another of his great books!  It seems my favorite authors are fading away, but Michael Connelly is still around, great and strong!
B00A3AU1U6|5.0|I was having trouble concentrating at work , being in a situation that required a lot of reading and diagramming at my desk<br /><br />I saw LUX on Amazon - being familiar with much of Eno's work - I chose this in particular because it was described as having been composed for an art installation piece.<br /><br />I played Lux on simple PC speakers - hardly any kind of sound system<br />but the effect on the &#34;sonic&#34; environment in the room was profound<br />It felt like a gel or &#34;self defined space&#34;  there were no longer any distractions and I could relax and work<br />(as a mtter of fact  an hour or so into the music I resolved some complicated issues that I had been struggling with)<br />some of Eno's earlier stuff like &#34;Discreet Music&#34; has a very strong Melody - that can distract or mezmerize you<br />when I was working - I did not &#34;Listen&#34; to LUX<br />it was more like heat or  even light in the room<br />the description &#34;sonic wallpaper&#34; doesn't do it justice<br /><br />So if you are looking for something to groove to or drive this is probably not the solution<br /><br />but for &#34;ambient&#34; environmental music - this is highly recommended<br />I really think Eno has perfected his craft in maturity
B009VB7P6G|4.0|A wonderful Move as usual to expect for a Disney movie. I would recomend this to anyone that is a movie watcher.

B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is a fun change of pace into the world of zombies. My family loves it and we watch it several times during the Halloween season if we get tired of just super scary movies.
B00002N9ER|5.0|very straightforward product, just make sure your holes are aligned perfectly before placing a maglite in place, some people have complained of the brackets breaking, but that is due to a mis- alignment of the brackets.

Ethan (the hero) He also seemed to be a bit of a rehash of the character from Run, as his basic personality was similar: Both fathers, both adulterers, both in a rocky relationship with the wife etc. Added to this is that Ethan is quite stubborn and bullish when a more subtle approach might really have worked better.<br /><br />The story centers around Ethan waking up in a small town, having learned he had a bad accident. He suffers amnesia and headaches. The residents are friendly at first, but Ethan just wants to leave and return home, and complete his mission- to locate some missing agents.<br /><br />Essential to the plot is that people aren't telling Ethan the truth. Ethan is told he is crazy, and treated poorly, as he tries to discover where he is, what is happening and how to leave. He is befriended by a mysterious girl, who helps him somewhat, and they attempt to escape. Throughout the story he suffers a few flashback from a prison torture session, which I mostly skipped.<br /><br />I thought the story was a slow starter but really picked up about ¼ through. You really want to know what is happening in Pines, and will root for Ethan to find out. Overall, I did like the book, although I wished for a more likeable hero, and I want to see what happens in Pines in the future!<br /><br />Spoilers....<br />* Even after reading this, some elements seemed wrong to me. For example, the overly violent townsfolk who are directed to kill Ethan seemed nightmarish and like something out of Lord of the Flies. I found it unrealistic and toonish and the explanation not sufficient for the level of cruelty displayed.<br /><br />* I felt it unbelievable that the female secret service agent wouldn't try to help him in some way, or his wife, wouldn't contact him, even though she is in the same town. Both weak, annoying women.<br /><br />* I thought the portrayal of the nurse as totally psycho and then as a relatively normal person difficult to reconcile.<br /><br />* I felt the townfolk's meaness and cruelty displayed towards the protagonist in his quest to find answers was a bit much, given that they too had been in his shoes at one time or another. A gentler approach might've been better in actually convincing him he was insane.<br /><br />* No good reason why the body of the secret service agent should simply have been left unattended in an empty house, when cleaning up the incident would've made more sense.<br /><br />* The wife bugged me. She was too co-dependent and the idea that any person might consider giving her own son some unknown sedative from a perfect stranger is too ridiculous. Her inability to assert herself or help her hubbie during his troubles seemed weak to me.<br /><br />* Loved the idea of the town of Pines, and would love a sequel.a relatively normal person difficult to reconcile.<br /><br />* I felt the townfolk's meaness and cruelty displayed towards the protagonist in his quest to find answers was a bit much, given that they too had been in his shoes at one time or another.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I gave this book as a gift and the person enjoyed it so much, she insisted I read it too.
3832793836|5.0|Given to my daughter for Christmas but we all have enjoyed it.  Different way to view the past and reflect on harder times.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Always enjoy his books, always !!<br />He has written many books over the years and he never fails to entertain.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I LOVE BATMAN MOVIES AND THE FACT THAT IT GOT ON TIME IT WAS NICLEY PACKED AND EVERYTHING AS DESCRIBED RELLY GOT ME SATISFIED
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love this series! I was a bit unsure at first. It actually took me a week to decide if I should buy this or not, but my curiosity got the better of me. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked! I look forward to reading more of your books!
B0035HKWM6|5.0|This is a great family movie to watch with or without the kids. It is a classic and is hilarious.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|Coldplay at the top of their game.  Watch out for the swearing on the 1st and 6th tracks.  I have kids in the car so want to keep the trash out their ears.  Otherwise a stunning production which covers a few venues but mostly shot in Paris with cuts to interviews and behind the scene stuff.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Keeps the time going by that's for sure. There are so many addicting games. I would recommend this app to everyone looking for a some random fun.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|The problem with anything that is considered entertainment these days is that everyone feels like they're an expert critic. Obviously this book has mixed reviews. However, I am giving this book two thumbs up and 5 stars! Why? Because I was entertained! I enjoyed every aspect of this book! I liked the extreme details and the historical background. I enjoyed the whirlwind romance. Impossible to find your soulmate in 3 weeks? Probably, but I liked the idea! The hopeless romantic in me couldn't resist! If that other girl from that other book can fall head over heels for a vampire why give this character guff about it? Because she is a scholar? Please! Its fiction...it's supposed to be outside the norm, especially if the characters are creatures and beings that don't exist! The point of fiction is to set reality aside for a little while and give your imagination  some exercise. I loved this story and look forward to reading the next book. Well done, Deborah!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I was so excited to see this movie based off of the previews.  Sadly I rented it on New Years Eve and was let down.  A lot of cussing and not to much that I saw as funny that wasn't already shown on the previews.
B007V65R54|5.0|Who knew probability could be so interesting? What you learn from this book will keep you grounded when the pundits practice magical thinking based on what they want to happen rather than on reality.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is a great main character. I wasn't thrilled with the first person style. But by the end of the book I was in love.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have installed and uninstalled this 7 times no.  It downloads the books, but when I click on the book to open it, it takes me back to the Kindle app. I've called them for help and all they can do is tell me to keep trying.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I'm not a fan of singing movies - but this one is LOL literally!  My kids were looking at me like I was nuts for laughing so much.  Loved it.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Edit-Original review below :<br /><br />I've made my feelings known. Took the kids to my brothers. Got there & was told they heard of a great movie we ALL were going to watch. Heard the name & I was like 'OH NO, I just saw that & it was terrible'. However, wanting them to form their own conclusion along with my kids & theirs (who had no idea I HATED THIS), we watched it. I kept my mouth shut the entire movie. My brother, sister in law, neices/nephews & my kids, along with 3 of the kids friends thought this was awful. The entire movie, all they did was rag on it & say it was 'STUPID' the entire flick. 'STUPID' was an adjective I used but never mentioned so I got quite a laugh hearing adults & 7 kids all use the same adjective, along with many more non flattering ones. & sorry to say, it was just as AWFUL watching it the 2nd time as it was the 1st. What really threw me was this is supposed to be a G rated 'family' flick, & I guess in theory it certainly is.....But needless to say us adults were quite off guard when the KIDS starting making comments about how the characters ALL LOOK STONED...Yep...KIDS made these comments!<br /><br />Anyway, just thought id edit this & add the above as not 1 of us liked this flick & ALL OF US thought it was HORRIBLE/STUPID...pick your most unflattering adjective & add it in....Even ALL the kids hated this.<br /><br />I know with movies everybody has different tastes but every now & then you see a flick leaving you wondering how anybody could have liked it. This is it!!! Again, I know everybody has different tastes & I respect the fact some liked or even loved this flick...but it still leaves me wondering how anybody could like this stupid tripe. IT WAS REALLY THAT BAD.....<br />--------------------------------------------<br />Saw this on tv. Saw it had 3.5 star rating which means excellent from my provider. Saw the reviews here which were pretty gapping. Not many 'in the middle'. Most are either 5 star or 1 star, meaning most either loved or hated it.<br /><br />Put me in the hated it camp.<br /><br />Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.<br /><br />I wont say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.<br /><br />This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen. While I fully understand everybody has different tastes, im still a bit shocked that anybody actually liked this ridiculous tripe.<br /><br />But please, watch it for yourself & form your own conclusion, as I did.<br /><br />But yep, If I tried listing everything I HATED about this flick, I'd be typing for hours. It was that HORRIBLE!!<br /><br />Glad some liked it, but for the life of me I cant comprehend why. One of the most boring & stupid flicks i've ever watched!oved or hated it.<br /><br />Put me in the hated it camp.<br /><br />Yes, I forced myself to watch it & although I kept wanting to turn it off, I gave in & watched it all.<br /><br />I wont say this is the worst movie I ever watched but its high on the list.<br /><br />This flick was simply one of the most absurdly boring & 'stupid' flicks I have ever seen.

0765325950|4.0|I would gladly pay the hardcover price for the ebook. Forcing people to do things a way they do not want to do them is a very poor business practice. This only encourages piracy and will not help sales.<br /><br />A good finish to the story nonetheless.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|Although I've seen all of the sequels, watching them again with my granddaughter after she finishes her homework makes it all worthwhile to watch again, she says it's hilarious. ..that's what she would do too!
B001LX2J22|5.0|I love Hannibel Lector .I also Love Anthony Hopkins.I love any movie that has Anthony Hopkins in it.I also got a good deal from amazon.com on my purchase.
1426308469|5.0|I bought it for my 2 1/2 yr old grandson who loves dinosaurs.  My daughter tells me he loves to listen and look at the pictures as she reads.  She also said that the parent info is really helpful, and it helps her explain things to him in a way he understands.
B009MZQQWA|2.0|I never was able to get sound through my roku box. I did manage to watch most of the movie by connecting my computer to my television. Of course I could not watch it in HD.
B00ARAO720|5.0|Living in the big Apple I find this film a bit unbelievable but exciting, and adventurous. It kept my attention.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|This app is ok because it doesn't always stick on the stickers or keep on my text...... they should really do something about it.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I received the first and second season of Vampire Diaries for Christmas and loved them. So I had to get season three and so far it has not disappointed.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I enjoyed binging on the several seasons of Walking Dead! I only wish that the Amazon Video connection were better. Not sure if its my TV, internet provider or Amazon Video provider, but sometimes it would stall or time out.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|When you have a house full with different ages and genders this is an \\"icebreaker \\"! Lots of fun. When the movie is over, you're on your own!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I only got this so FF6 could be remade too. There's been add ons but to completely redo it with today's technology without killing the story yeah
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Several parties using, or abusing, the system to achieve ends which may or may not be natural justice within the justice system. As events unfold, you're drawn deeper into an ever changing and more unlikely scenario, which Grisham makes quite plausible. A fascinating read.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Good sequel to Iron Man I, Good action Great sound Great 1080P video Downey is Great, so is Rourke a<br />must see movie.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Some things are best when left alone. Although modernized with updated technology and cinematography, the original with Arnold Schwarzenegger is a classic not to be tampered with.
0143038419|5.0|I gave it to my mom and told her to get through the first few chapters as fast as possible. Then you will be able to embark on a journey of your life-time. This seriously changed my outlook on life to a more positive way of dealing with truth, the unknown, God and meditation. I am a Christian and found this book to be very profound and enlightening.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Rated high due to the great image and sound quality of the 3 movies. We opened them up and spent the whole day watching the whole trilogy. There is a slight difference in the sound volume overall with the last one, Dark Knight Rises, though, as everything seemed louder, especially Bane's voice. But maybe it had more to do with how we had set up soundwise. With the first 2 movies, we didn't need to change anything. Overall, it's quite an experience to finally get this.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Want a fun adventure that doesn't make you cry like all the other pixar movies? Funny and easy going, great movie to put on multiple times in the background just to listen to the great accents!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I liked that it had maybe only one cuss word and no sex! Great action packed film and good acting! Great stunts too!
B003UESJ9M|3.0|The speed of sending the dvd was great.  It was here in less that 3 days.<br />The movie was ok but not great.  It was sad.  I ordered it because I bought &#34;Proud Country&#34;.  It had a happy ending and you could watch it again and again.  No so with Country Strong.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I have read Colleen Hoover's other books, Slammed and Point of Retreat and loved them, so I decided to give this one a try. I could NOT put it down. The story is excellent, a bit different from her other stories but I loved it none the less. I'm really really hoping she does a sequel!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|World of Goo is too fun! Graphics are great and levels are all different. Highly addicting! Everyone in my family enjoys it too.
B009JBZH54|5.0|When I saw the packaging on this item i felt like \\"you get what pay for\\", but when I opened I was surprise with how well was constructed... Great price great product great movies!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so addicting. I love the graphics and all the different animals. I would recommend this game to all of my friends and family.

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I am very happy that my seven year old daughter loves the book.  She is reading the kindle edition and is highly engaged.  Her confidence in her ability to read a chapter book has skyrocketed.  I found lots to smile about too, as we read some parts of the book together.  It's a fun read for kids and grown ups.
B008J34466|5.0|I have always loved p!nk and this album is no execption!!  It is a must buy if you are a fan!<br />Keep it up it is fab!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Works as intended (which is great).<br /><br />The stock fan/heatsink that comes with this chip is absolute crap, but you probably already knew it would be since you are building your own computer.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|free flow is addicting fun for all ages. puzzles vary in complexity and difficulty in all board sizes. you can even buy more puzzles to keep the fun going.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Thank you for E BaY And kindle for giving it to me and the world they have so many things.

B00936A0RU|5.0|I loved this movie and since its a true story made it even better.It has some history in it.I thought Tom Hardy was great!!!
0143120530|3.0|When I first read the reviews of this book, I was really excited and thought maybe I can use a better memory - so my expectations was that how Joshua actually went about training from zero to 100. I started reading the book and found it having information on how the brain works, memory works, case studies of patients with best and worst memory etc.    I really liked the fresh take on memory and how to improve it. BUT the book keeps going on and on about how he interacted with his mentor how he did things without never really going in to the details of how to actually train your memory using the techniques he learned and small hurdles he went through (not even a pointer to the resources he used except Ad Herennium)    If you want this book to know about the memory techniques, the only techniques he talks about are memory palace and Major system, nothing more. if you have no idea about memory training and want to know basics of the world of memory, then this book would be a good start. If you want to know the actual memory techniques and methods you are better off with other websites(like [...]) and books.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I got this for my wife and she has been in TV dream world since.  She said this is the funnest gift I have ever bought her.  We were married in 1989
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book from start to finish. Could really identify with charlie and feeling alone and just needing someone to understand you.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Really a super cute christmas flick. loved the creativity. Would highly recommend this film and even buy it when I can.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  We went and saw the broadway show itself and she has been singing the songs from the show since.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, I couldn't not stop reading. You feel so connected to the characters, and can feel their emotions throughout the story
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is entertaining fun and addicting if you are looking for a fun game you should get subway surfer!!!
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|It gets the job done.  I thought it would be a bit bigger, but no sweat, its small size is actually quite a benefit.  It is not the most sturdiest thing ever, but gets the job done.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|Started to watch it but it is full of witchcraft and sorcery among other things so we opted not to watch this movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book is a must read! I couldn't put it down.  It's very interesting and thought-provoking.  It makes you wonder how well you really know someone and how would you react if your child was accused of such things.  Highly recommmend!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I liked it just that I'm only ten and my parents cant even figure out why it reset and I lost my coins and my highscore too plus i lost all my characters and mine didn't update to the new York version is it because its a kindle fire. I don't know but also wouldn't something pop up asking me if I wanted to update I don't know but I'm really upset please give me any Information by replying to this also if your wondrong ive had this game since it came out
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|But motions are simple (up, down, left, right, tap and double tap), no real &#34;flick and swoosh&#34;-ing. But I'm happy with it.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown's story is nothing short of incredible. One of the most inspiring tales I have ever read. Endless respect to a true hero.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian points out tips that have worked for me.  If your looking for a good work out that wont kill ya this is the one.
0316789720|5.0|My five year old and I both enjoyed replicating the little drawings from this classic book.  It was very rewarding for my daughter to be able to combine simple shapes and make a recognizable drawing.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Supernatural is still an excellent show and episode 1 with  Castiel (Misha Collins) allowing Sam, Dean and Bobby to live while warning them not to interfere in his business is excellent.  Death (guest star Julian Richings) is an incredible actor.  Great show.
B0014JKJHK|3.0|I like that they are light, cheap, and comfortable fit, but I found them to not breathe well enough for my liking -- by the end of the day my feet have been quite sweaty even with thin socks on.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I'm not surprised that I fell in love with the score. Shore just has a way with music and he captures every note so we can hear it. I love this score and I am excited for the next 2 that will come out later.
0316789798|5.0|All the Ed Emberley books are great for combining simple shapes to make cute drawings.  There are a ton of animals in this one!
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|love the story, the music was abit disappointing, of course after phamtom that would be hard to surpass. the story answered questions left from the phantom
B00A757EFW|5.0|I put this on my daughters kindle fire for me and I love playing it.  It was one of my favorite games in the....uhhhhhh.....70's!  I have to practice more since I was used to a joy stick!
141659521X|3.0|For some reason Vince is not getting better. I have bought all his books, and find the earlier one's were better. Still a decent read, but just okay.  He needs another block buster.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I've seen the stage play twice and the anniversary specials including this one, several times. I never tire of it.  I love the music and the actors.  If you like the music and the movie, you will lBove this too.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|absolutely the best. music and story and this edition is the best Loved seeing the older phantoms and of course, sarah brightman.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|When the Kindle Micro USB cable wire flaked off in pieces and I was going on vacation with 5 recently downloaded books, Amazon came to my rescue.  Within 3 days I had my new wire courtesy of Amazon.  Thank you, Amazon.
0385535147|5.0|This is really a fun book. A really great read. One of best books I have read in quite a while. What a concoction this was. Very entertaining to say the least. One of his best books.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I was expecting more of a first person novel, but this has a good flow to it. Shows you a much broader picture.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is great. I bought it for my 9 yr old son along with the kindle. If it can hold up to him, it has to be a descent product.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Movie sequels are rarely as good as the originals and this one is no exception.  This was such a great series with Bale playing Batman, that it's hard to fault them.  But this story was one of summing things up and ending the story so much so, it didn't quite have the same feel as the first two.  So, it's a very good movie... just not as good as one or two.
B007TK77QE|4.0|This was fabulous and very intriguing.  I did find a ittlle long winded and laborious through the middle but it redeemed itself with a fascinating and exciting finish.
B005D7ECMM|5.0|This product is lovely! The box is very attractive -- it is heavy and textured and includes a reprint of the 1962 booklet &#34;The Legend of Lawrence&#34; -- and the video is well-formatted. I purchased this as a Christmas present for myself, and I am so happy with it!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  Yes it is slow to the average viewer, but that was the film's intention.  Sometimes less is more.  There was so much tension throughout the movie, even in the \\"slow parts\\" where there was virtually no dialogue.  The cherry on top was the soundtrack.  Every song played in the movie fit the scene during the song perfectly!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|But not classic lit. She tells a good story, and I have huge respect for that. But the prose is a little automated. Still, worth curling up with.
B002NEFL8W|5.0|This Grip Fits PERFECT! i have not taken it off my camera since i put it on. i feels great in my hand and i love being able to use two batteries. LOVE IT! worth the price!
B009PK9SB8|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and it works perfectly! He loves the BacPac and he's never had any trouble with it.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|In my mind, ESV stands for Extra Special Version.  It's easy to read, easy to understand, the maps and commentaries are terrific.  They tell you about biblical resources, reasons and options with regard specific verse-by-verse translation; as well as the reason the particular verse translation was chosen.  I've given several of these as gifts...and they are always well received.  My first copy was a gift from the pastor of our church....it is; Extra Special.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|So fun to read, detailing my history as a kid of the 80's. Still, I've suggested it for people of all ages. An easy read, an engaging and not unrealistic tale, and ultimately a feel good kinda thing. Grab it, read it, no harm done!
B005LAII8A|5.0|Looper is a great movie but you have to pay attention and think during it.  At the same time though it is pointed out that you should not over think the time travel aspects.  The creator has said this many times and the characters also say it.  If you think time travel works a certain way and are not willing to think differently then you might not like this but unless you have traveled through time yourself you have no idea how it works anyways...  Great action, actors, very bloody and dark.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had tremendous diffuculty separating myself from this book.  When I had to stop,  you know, to take care of the little things,  such as parenting my two young children and making a living, this book was screaming out for some attention!  Some heavy subject matter but unfortunately it's all too common in todays world and actually made me feel more deeply for these characters.  Very well executed and delivered!
B009RH973I|3.0|I am a little disappointed with the stand; not particularly sturdy.Otherwise, the case is okay. Cover is adequate for protection.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I have the original Kindle and when my cord started falling apart I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement for free. Very pleased.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun characters from Stephanie Plum mystery series. Katherine Heygl is entertaining as she transforms from ditsy to strong female bounty hunter,
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is more than I bargained for. It is not only relaxing to listen to, but it is fun to set up. It is very intuitive to use and the sounds work well together. I only would change one thing and that would be to make some of the loops a little longer so it isn't so obvious that they are loops.
B0091LS07E|5.0|THIS PARTICULAR ARTIST WAS ONE MY SISTER HAD PLACED ON HER CHRISTMAS WISH LIST.  SHE REALLY LIKES THE CD. HOPEFULLY I WILL GET TO HEAR IT.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is classic hippie music.  I like it a lot.  I also like the fact that you can understand what he is saying and there is none of that \\"shadowing\\" music over top of it that distorts the sound.
B008ENA74E|5.0|Good information about Goldman Sachs - its interview processes; internal workings; how it changed over time and why everybody hates it now!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|the descriptiom is too short and simple.  It is scify but credible.  The science behind is credible.  what I liked the most was the wit.  For the majority of the book is 1st person talk in the form of log entries and they are entertaining.  I would love to see this converted into a mini series.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SISTER.  SHE REALLY LIKES THE CE.  I HOPE I CAN HEAR IT SOON ALSO.
0765325950|5.0|IT STAYS WITH THE STORY. KEEPS YOU ON YOUR SEAT. I ENJOYED THE COMPLETE  STORY. JUST LOOKING F0RWARD TO ANY OTHER TO READ. AND I AM SURE YOU WILL AS WELL.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Captivating, I can't believe I missed this in public television.  I can't wait for season 3.  Why can't we make classy shows in our country.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Wonderful FUN watch!!! Brought back many GOOD childhood memories. It was fun to share with yet another generation of kids.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|I GOT THIS AS A GIFT FOR ONE OF MY NEICES FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT.  SHE HAD WANTED A COPY OF THIS MOVIE IN BLU-RAY.  SHE LOVES IT.
0765325950|1.0|I agree with my fellow 1 star peeps.  Hardcover only is lame.  I'll wait until April or find a scanned copy.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|I bought this record as a present and it was phenomenally well-received. The record came in pristine condition, booklet, packaging, record and all. Plus, of course, the music on it was the best part!
B009LGO88E|5.0|At first, I had to thank all the people who sells product for Japan, I really love Japanese stuff.<br /><br />This product works excellent with Nintendo 3DS XL NTSC-USA version, just be sure your system firmware is updated.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Really good book. Someone recommended it to me and I'm glad I took their advice. This is definitely a read-again coming from someone who wouldn't read a book twice in his lifetime.
B00170MYIS|4.0|This was a great purchase for me i was able to use my camera again.  Previous products were to expensive, this was a reasonable replacement for my battery.
B005LAII80|5.0|Awesome movie. No unnecessary filler, just grisly, brutal action. Dredd is an awesome character, and I hope that we will be able to see more of him.
B004PKOKSO|5.0|Long a John Scofield fan, this recent work beautifully illustrates this fine artists evolution. It is thoughtful, introspective and a joy to listen to no matter your mood. From gray overcast days to spirited drives on back country roads, this work never disappoints. Brilliant gathering of musicians too with Larry Goldsmith on piano and organ, Scott Colley on bass and the ever amazing, innovative and always tasteful in the moment Brian Blade on drums. I'm from the Beatles generation, heavily oriented towards guitar; with that it rarely gets any better than John Scofield.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love it is so good warning very addicting start with 40coins  giant coins are good definitely get this game love it
1594487154|4.0|This is a profound book of wisdom for me and I need more time to fully digest it. But I think that readers should be warned that some of Dan Pink's ideas may not be good and some may be dangerous.<br /><br />(The author does not mention that any sales experts reviewed the text, before it was printed)<br /><br />First of all, the book cover bothers me: \\"DANIEL H.PINK To Sell is Human\\". The first impression I get is that this is an autobiography. The author places his name at the top, in big letters. The real title is in small letters. Why?<br /><br />It seems to me, that first and foremost, selling is not about the seller, but the buyer. But we think so often of salespeople with big egos. Does Dan Pink have a big ego? I hope not.<br /><br />I think selling and persuasion are firstly about serving others. Pink waits until the very last page of the book to suggest that you ask:<br />========================================================<br />1) If the person you're selling to agrees to buy, will his or her life improve?<br />2) When your interaction is over, will the world be a better place than when you began?<br />========================================================<br /><br />Perhaps, in future editions, Pink will revise and enlarge on these profound ideas, and put the subject of selling in front of his name and the service idea at the beginning, not at the end.<br /><br />\\"A little knowledge/learning is a dangerous thing\\"<br /><br />Buy the book. It may change your life. But READER BEWARE!
B001NLKT60|5.0|I read this book based on reviews I had read, not knowing if the raves were just hype. They were not. Other than the hard to pronounce names of places and people the book was a real page turner. I was also pleased to see that the movie followed the book very closely, which is not always rhe case.
0062101897|5.0|Bought a Christmas gift for my son, who's a devout Potter fan and had talked about getting it for his Potter collection
0425263908|5.0|Love this book! Literally read in one sitting, I just couldn't stop. Can't wait for the new book to come out! I <3 Gideon
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Very accurate for its kind. I timed it on my 3rd day and it was late 5s in 24 hours ( my other '5' rushes 10 to 15s ). It is high quality, and has quite unusual look going against some trends. Power reserve is about 12 to 20 hours.<br />Pros:<br />Cheap, well made, automatic, Seiko<br />Cons:<br /> Strap is going to wear out, can't think about anything else...<br /><br />I am happy with my purchase.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Same review as The Girl Who Played With Fire. I made a comment about the movie but this is the book that has been made into a movie. I look forward the the movie made from this book.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Bought as Christmas gift for my son, who has now spread his enjoyment of the series to his mom and me.  We watched both seasons with him, and were all prepped for 3rd season debut last Sunday (Jan. 6)
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I have been watching this series from the beginning and it's always entertaining.  My favorite character is Abbey and it's always a treat to watch her in each episode.
B009POCG0Y|4.0|This is one movie that I'm still trying to wrap my brain around. Talk about a dysfunctional family! This one is one for the books. Matthew McConaughey is great as Joe, the contract killer who also happens to be a Cop. Enter a young man who has run out of ways and ideas to get money he owes drug dealers. So he comes up with a scheme to kill his mother, the initial cause of his trouble, for the insurance money. But he needs help...he goes to his father who is more upset that he is not the benificiary to the insurance money even though he is married to someone else. The sister is the innocent in all but even she cannot claim full innocence since she goes along with the scheme mainly because her &#34;slow&#34; mental capacity is due to her mother. But they have no money up front to give Joe, so he takes her as a retainer fee. What evolves from there is truely one for the psychology books as they try to get the insurance money, save the sister from Joe and survive the hate they have for one another. McConaughey is great as Joe and a credit to his acting ability as he portrays a very cold,calculating and sick killer. His scene in the kitchen with the stepmother and fried chicken leg is intense and will leave you holding your breath especially as they begin turning on each other. This is not a movie for everyone as I believe one reviewer stated and definately not your typical murder for hire movie. There is nudity which could have been left out without harming the plot line but other than that, this is one movie that will probably not win awards but is worth seeing. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 was the ending. It left me seriously cursing the director but does not detract from the movie itself, just leaves you to find your own conclusion.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Can't wait for the next one , very exciting movie.<br />Watched it with low expectations , but this movie surprised me if anyone gives below a 4 they don't know what a good movie is.
B009PAETCG|1.0|My son played this game for less then two minutes and hasn't looked back since. You have one option ( surprise) or you have to upgrade$. Whateva
B009GESJH2|5.0|As Always Kid Rock delivers!!!  Love this CD, and Love Kid Rock! Highly recommend this CD to all people, Kid Rock~ ROCKS
B004QKK9O2|2.0|The prose, for me, is difficult and frustrating. It's affected tone distracts from what could be a beautiful story and the beautiful voice of a curious young girl, experiencing Dickens's 'Great Expectations' in the midst of civil and domestic strife. A quarter of the way through the book, I had little hope of the prose becoming more likeable, so I hoped the plot and indefatigable characters of this Matilda and Pip would stand on their own, and they did somewhat.<br /><br />See my full book reviews at LitBeetle.com!
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I loved this movie. I feel to enjoy it though, one must really like the bank Pink Floyd otherwise I understand if one didn't like it. Outstanding if you like Pink Floyd.
B0086700CM|4.0|I played this on my phone and loved it so I decided to download it for my daughter on her kindle but it keeps crashing and apparently its not the only have having this issue.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really enjoy this solitaire game. Works great on my kindle fire. Very fun! Only drawback is the ads that pop up before each game. However you can easily skip past them and continue on to your game, so they don't annoy me too much. It's just too bad they have to be there.
B001VEHZZ2|3.0|Hamid delivers haunting conflict in the narrator with near-perfect precision. He has obviously structured the narrative with the utmost care. I found, however, Changez's addressal of the unseen, unheard, unnamed American character annoying, affected--a thinly veiled lesson that, while evoking powerful questions in me as I read, mostly annoyed. Much of the plot I found predictable, but Hamid's mastery of craftedness is evident and often times beautiful, if not in the prose and plot, then in the entrancing, intimidatingly real mind he presents in Changez and in the arc of Changez's metamorphosis.<br /><br />Check out my full-length book reviews at LitBeetle.com!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is so much fun and i enjoy it lots. recomend it to everyone. it helps me to relax  before bedtme.
B00A0SLTCU|5.0|worth every penny... Good story, great speciql effects.. The fall is cool... I would recommend this movie to any sci fi , action movie goer.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love my cloud player and have been using it since its humble beginnings. It has come a long way and only gets better. Online editing of metadata helps to fix my music collection and keep things organized. Their music is reasonably priced most of the time in comparison to other MP3 vendors out there too. My only minor complaint is on the recent device limits set. I have several android devices, which I think is probably making me more of an exception. Regardless, five as a device limit causes me to pick and choose more often than I like. Ten would be a better number.
1451695187|5.0|What in interesting journey though this neurosurgen's near death esperience. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in this subject.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game.  When will the new update be available for the kindle fire?  I play it on my phone but get very frustrated when it freezes.  Hurry with the update for the kindle fire.  Thanks
1419705849|5.0|My son loves these books and was pretty pumped when he saw it. It was a christmas gift and it got here quickly.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is a great album for Michael Buble. I have grown to like him more over the years and this Christmas album was no disappointment! This is great for holiday parties, singing along and jamming in your car. I even heard a few of the songs from this album in store soundtracks this year. He is an artist that all kinds of music lovers can appreciate.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I enjoyed this intense thriller. It reminded me of Stieg Larssons style of writing. I know I will be reading the next Harry Hole novel.
0316017930|5.0|The book arrived today in great condition and I was more than pleased with the packaging of it. I cant wait to start reading this book :)
1400052173|5.0|The book came in pretty good condition and I wasn't sure I would enjoy reading because it is required for school. But I am engulfed and must admit, enjoying it.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is my first album purchase for Mumford & Sons. I have heard a few of their other songs from other albums and already liked them well enough, before I bought this album. I was really impressed with the instrumentation and the pure sound that they produced. This is definitely worth owning!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|pretty cool app. like it a lot. i like that u can fall asleep to the white noise if u want &amp; also gives temerature
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Another great angry birds, makes me laugh with the Star Wars theme. New birds, new levels, and it is free!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|My four year old loves this game! He has already won all the levels and he's still playing it. I like playing it as well. It's just a great game with a cool concept and it's not very often that I find a game that my son and I both enjoy.
B005LAII80|5.0|I hated the first Dredd. I loved this one. I am disappointed that I did not see this new Dredd at an IMAX 3D Theater now that I know how good this movie is. I never write Amazon reviews either, I just felt that like myself, there are too many who ignored the movie who would be pleasantly surprised upon watching it.<br /><br />This movie is what it is, and it knows it -- pure action. Don't expect a hidden subplot, surprise characters or twists. Dredd and his rookie, Anderson, are trapped in a giant mega project called Peach Trees. Upon being trapped, an hour of badassery follows; gun fights, gore and a soundtrack to match.<br /><br />Big TV, 3D Glasses, and 5.1 surround cranked up are highly recommended.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I've always had a fondness for Historical Romances, and I've especially loved this book as it has a twist, vampires! I really did enjoy this book but there is really to much sexual tension between Honoria and Blade. At first she truly doesn't know what to make of it:<br />  \\"Unlikely.\\" She gave him a reserved look as she seated herself. \\"you want something from me.\\"<br />  \\"A gentleman never professes 'is desires to a lady,\\" he admitted. \\"It ain't polite.\\"<br />  A healthy flush of color touched her cheeks. \\"You're quite right of course. But a gentleman should never admit to having such desires in the first instance.\\"<br />Of course as they get to know each other the sexual tension grows, and so doesn't the bluntness from Blade. \\"Do you want to touch me? Is that what's got your heart poundin' in your ears and your breath thick in your throat?\\" A little smile touched his lips. \\"I'll let you, you know. You can run those pretty little fingers all over me if you want. Or that sweet little mouth if you'd prefer.\\" He took a step closer. \\"Do you want a taste o' me Honor? Do you want to lick the sweat from me body, taste the salt o'me skin?\\" Gosh Blade is Oh My God! That man is HOT!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing. Kept you on the edge of your seat. You read twists in the story you would've never seen coming! Simply amazing
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I love this cd it makes my heart swell with memories of my family that have passed away, & still remembered
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I wasn't expecting a very good story when I started reading this book. After what everyone has said after reading it, I was expecting something way different. I fell in love with it and cannot wait to read the next one. Great and different read.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I was hoping for a lot more action out of this flick. Most of the time it was boring. The general idea of the plot is cool, but it wasn't developed enough.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I personally couldn't have been more happier about this book and the outcome of it. I feel as if I can totally relate -- being that I'm a senior in high school myself like much of Charlie's friends. It's going to be a bittersweet time in my life when I have to go. Mainly because I have to leave the ones I love behind that I cherish so much! But on the other note, I will be moving on. I will continue to be living my life, and hopefully \\"participating\\"! Lol. (I say that because I'm a thinker as well...but I don't do it as much as Charlie does throughout this book). I love this book, and I'm going to watch the movie soon! This is a must read for everyone! My favorite book of all time!
B008PUXMP2|5.0|So soulful. Also with the trilogy you can see the transition. Award winning, you can hear her feelings through her music.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I liked it.  Am waiting for the next series to come out in the spring in a bundle.<br />Hurry spring.
B005LAII80|5.0|i've never read the comics (though i might be interested to after seeing this), but i've seen the tragedy that is the Stallone/Schneider film and this new film completely wipes that other one away. i can see the light now. don't go in expecting something with great dramatic weight, this is essentially one long chase scene but in a good way. super fun 80's style action, kind of on the gory side so look out if that doesn't jive with you too well. feels like paul verheoven directed this in between robocop and total recall and would make a solid triple feature with those films. check it out!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this rating because I don't like this book.I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you like dictionaries. I'm probably not going to read this book again.
B005LAII80|5.0|Just watched Dredd on Blu Ray in 2d, I was really disappointed I didn't see this in theaters when it was out (btw never saw \\"Judge Dredd\\" I refused too ha!) First off, people complain Hollywood won't make any good violent action films, well here ya go! and its original!  Yes, its similar in plot to \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" but that's just cause they are both trapped in a building.  My expectations were very very high for this, when I saw the original stills I thought it looked cheap and really really low budget!!!  However, to my surprise and seems like everyone else's, the movie is great!! It gets straight to the point, the plot is simple and its a great 80's action flick!!  Watching in 2D was great, but this movie makes me want to get a 3D TV!!!  I hate 3D but I can only imagine how amazing this film would look!  The slow motion is not over done! COUGH \\"300\\" COUGH and its not dragged out and the writers didn't go for some huge crazy plot!  Dredd and a rookie must go investigate a crime scene, and then it all goes down hill from there!!  Full of action!!!<br />My only gripe is the quality of the blu-ray, I was hoping for a more crystal screen, was a little grainy to me, but I get it that it was made to look dirty and I know the budget wasn't the highest, Karl Urban gained a lot of points in my book!  You never see his full face, and he pulls of a great job just with his voice!!<br />Its a shame! I doubt there will be a sequel, but there should be!!  This gave me the good fun shoot em up memories of other films as of late, especially Punisher: War Zone, just not as cheesy, well not at all as cheesy!  But the action is great in that as well!!!  Go buy this so they make another!!
1250027624|5.0|The book &#34;The Chronicles of Downton Abbey: A New Era&#34; by Jessica Fellowes was a Christmas gift for my sister. who is one of the many Americans in love with the TV series!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book and I would recommend this book to anyone. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK IT IS AMAZING!!!
B000SUKPKM|5.0|Never get tired of listening to Slide- and absolutely loved them in concert! Johnny R. is the best, and is so nice to his fans :-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This may be the scariest read ever for me.  Like a box of CrackerJack:  you don't know what's coming, but you know it's a prize.  And a surprise!  I'm reminded of my ex.  That's the only downside to this one.
B000FC10WU|5.0|It kept me guessing from start to finish.  I thought I knew but of course I was wrong. I have always loved reading Agatha<br />Christie books.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for in a calculator. Love the large size, handles everything I need it for and best of all~it was FREE!
0307949486|5.0|I bought the Kindle version of the book when it was on sale for $1.99. I'm glad it was on sale because I might not have read it otherwise, and I really enjoyed the book. I thought it started out very slowly, but I wasn't going to judge the entire book based on the first few pages. Do keep reading, even though it starts out slowly!! I kept reading and reading, and at some point, I became so hooked that it was torture to put it down so I could sleep. As soon as I finished reading the first one, I immediately bought books two and three; I sense a few sleepless nights in my future.
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|If you are a fan of adventure stories, stories of survival under trying circumstances or of man against adversity, this is a not to be missed story. From the moment that I started reading, it had me in its grip. What a story!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it. It is very addicting. Wrote very well. I can not wait to read the next two books!
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|For people who like suspense and twists and turns in a movie, I would definitely recommend this movie. I definitely enjoyed it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Very good price, every fan of star wars must have this, even the older episodes looks great in BR you need have one of this
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app everybody should have :)<br />I think the link to other applications makes it wonderful :)
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Why are you reading the reviews?? Best show, watch  now you won't regret it. Watch the first season first though, it might be slower paced but builds up to second season
1465001107|5.0|This is a great calendar and the pictures of Michael are wonderful, but I was a little disappointed by the size of some of the photos. I expected better since this is supposed to be approved by the estate of Michael Jackson. Aside from this, this calendar is still a great way to remember Michael every day, every month of the 2013 year. R.I.P. Michael! Gone, but not forgotten!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Great story about human emotion could have used a few more exciting areas. Very sad how children were treated in orphanages.
1451648537|5.0|Really easy to read and pictures in the book really gave a nice insight to the life of Mr. Jobs. If you use his products, might as well learn a bit about him too
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Definitely easier than original angry birds, so it makes it more fun and not so intimidating. That being said, kids would be more likely to play this vs. the original
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I liked this book because it's really funny funny and its a good children's book out of 1out of 10 I give it a ...10!!!!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I love that they released this in a hard copy. I bought this one for a friend that isn't able to hook her ps3 up to wifi, yet wanted to play this game. The bonus content is also really cool.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|For me words can not describe this music. Having been to their last tour  in Tampa, dragging my wife along this brings back memories for both of us. She was never a fan until this show but she is now and big time.<br /><br />Reading many of these reviews at the lower star level I have to ask myself, is  anything perfect? Did you buy it to watch or listen ? Rarely do I watch any concert, it's the music and memories that are important. Rather than the negatives look for the positive thing. It's outstanding as far as music goes and brings back a ton of memories.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Couldn't stop reading even at the books end, but the spare writing caused the story to fall short of it's potential.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|this game is addicting! plays real well on the kindle. it can also get challenging which keeps it from getting boring. you should try this game if your like me you&quot;ll love it.
B008M36EEI|4.0|No a bad Movie,  Well acted great original story and clean ending.  decent date movie if your looking for something fun and light.
B005LAII80|2.0|What do you get if you combined the movies, Raid: Redemption, Punisher: War Zone, The Dark Knight with Raul Julia from, Street Fighter, you get, DREDD!?!<br /><br />Okay, so I've never read the Dredd comics (2000AD) but I have seen lots of the artwork from said comics and know that Dredd is suppose to be a big, brutish, lug of a guy, encased in a suit that he barely fits into (one of the things they got right with Stallone in the original version) but what we get in this incarnation is Karl Urban (of Xena, Doom, Pathfinder) who, although a pretty fit guy, looks like a sickly person wearing an outfit that was meant to be worn by a guy twice his size (thus the Raul Julia refference, as he WAS sick when he was making the movie, Street Fighter, and he looked it, with his overtly large costume threatening to consume him at every turn) not to mention the ill fitting of his iconic helmet and the fact that unlike Peter Weller in Robocop, his mouth and chin just don't stand out as good from under the helmet, making him look too small for the thing (once again, Stallone looked pretty good in the helmet).<br /><br />As for the story, if you've seen, Raid: Redemption, or the last half of, The Punisher: War Zone, then you've basically seen this film; good guys go into a large story, tenement building to get to the bad guy(s) at the top, and have to fight their way through throngs of heavily armed henchmen sent by said bad guy(s) to kill them, and all manner of kayos ensues (heck, the baddies from both War Zone and Dredd have bad facial scars that help to define who they are and why they're doing some of the bad stuff that they're doing).<br /><br />As for the, Dark Knight reference, it's in regards to the fact that the futuristic cities in both, look more like the downtown of most major metropolitan city, just with a few taller CGI created buildings seen in the distance (another thing the Stallone movie got right, as the comics show Mega City 1, as this multi-teared, Vegas like basterdization, with massive buildings, atop massive buildings, atop massive buildings all decked out in glass, neon and grime).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie per say, it's just that it's not the definitive Judge Dredd movie that the critics were touting it as being, feeling more like a very small scale indie film that was given a bigger budget after the fact, meaning that the script is pretty basic, the effects are added in, after the fact embellishments (that look cool for the most part, but aren't necessary to the story, what little story we get).<br /><br />Karl Urban is a good actor, but was (in my opinion) miscast in this role (Jason Statham might have been a better choice or even, The Rock could have given the character the iconic profile that is Dredd) and the film plays more like you're watching a HD video game with a basic story plot to move along the action and carnage, but little in the way of character depth or real character development to be found.basterdization, with massive buildings, atop massive buildings, atop massive buildings all decked out in glass, neon and grime).<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie per say, it's just that it's not the definitive Judge Dredd movie that the critics were touting it as being, feeling more like a very small scale indie film that was given a bigger budget after the fact, meaning that the script is pretty basic, the effects are added in, after the fact embellishments (that look cool for the most part, but aren't necessary to the story, what little story we get).<br /><br />Karl Urban is a good actor, but was (in my opinion) miscast in this role (Jason Statham might have been a better choice or even, The Rock could have given the character the iconic profile that is Dredd) and the film plays more like you're watching a HD video game with a basic story plot to move along the action and carnage, but little in the way of character depth or real character development to be found.
0545265355|5.0|Amazing series and I hate it took me this long to read it! Cannot wait for the movies to see how they end up
B00026WU64|5.0|This is only his second studio album...yet it sounds so different from his first; not in a bad way though.  I sort of gives you the idea that his future albums would be unique in their own ways...and how they were.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this book in less than three days; so bloody exhilarating! The characters truly came to life and you began to really empathize with all of them. If you're a Harry Potter fan i would recommend this book!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I think this is one of the best books I have ever read, along with HBO series, it is superb.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun but energy doesn't last long when you get to higher levels and don't like that in order to visit the hunting room you have to buy bullets each timeI
B001N1DPDE|2.0|Ordered this knife and instantly returned it. Was so dull when it arrived! couldnt cut paper/cardboard. The overall feel of it to me was just awkward. Thick handles and just didnt feel comfortable in the hand. Got a lot of heft to it though and if you take the time to sharpen it [or maybe yours comes sharp] It could be a good knife for its intended purpose. Personally I didnt like it.
B007R3B4RG|4.0|One of the most unexpected releases I ran across last year was Joey Ramone’s<br />second posthumously released album, …Ya Know?. I was unaware that another<br />album would be released following 2002’s Don’t Worry About Me, but alas, here<br />we are. The albums are quite similar in sound, but I find …Ya Know? much more<br />satisfying on every level. Generally speaking, it’s a better, more well-rounded<br />rock ‘n roll album.<br /><br />There are a plethora of guest musicians on the album; everyone from Joan Jett<br />and Richie Ramone to Bun E. Carlos of Cheap Trick and Steven Van Zandt of Bruce<br />Springsteen and the E Street Band. The entire album is solid, but songs like “Rock ‘n<br />Roll is the Answer,” “Going Nowhere Fast,” “Party Line” and “New York City” truly<br />let you appreciate the influential icon in a different way than one might through his<br />work with the Ramones. Speaking of the Ramones, …Ya Know? features<br />re-workings of the Ramones’ “Merry Christmas (I Don’t Want to Fight Tonight)” and<br />“Life’s a Gas.”<br /><br />If you’re a fan of the Ramones, Joey’s first solo album or straightforward rock and<br />roll, you’ll enjoy this. Even in death, Joey does not disappoint.

B00A7ZXH4O|4.0|I like Rihanna- she has a crossover style to her- meaning she can make any genre like her.  Her style is versatile
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is really fun for the whole family! with the aspect of getting to save the lose animals and being able to crossbreed is very cool
0596000480|5.0|I used through chapter 12, after that I was all set for what I needed. If you are going to commit teh entiure thing with self study, good luck! LOL
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book had me hooked from start to finish!<br />Kate Morton is an accomplished storyteller. I love the way she expertly weaves this inspiring tale as she skillfully transitions between past and present. you'll love the surprise ending!
B006M4RN3U|3.0|Like all albums there are only one to two songs that you will like and the rest well ok. Same with this album.  I'm glad I got it though. the disc was in good condition and it was shipped quickly considering it was Xmas holiday. Thank you.
0345803493|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to others.  I read the series of all three books.  I think the second one, Fifty Shades Darker, puts people, situations,  and the storyline in perspective.  It seems to set straight some of the things in the first book.  I thought the series was well written, and would love to read more books by E.L. James.
B001GQACGE|3.0|Only two songs are good the rest waste of time.  I got a good deal on it so it's ok. The disc was in good shape, fast shipping, good price. Thanks.
1401322786|5.0|If you are a Mitch Albom fan, this book is a must,  I only wish we had more authors like Mr. Albom.  I highly recommend The Time Keeper, as well as any other Mitch Albom books.
B000AM2L1O|4.0|Her mother said the doll is beautiful and god quality and the child loves it.  Based on her reaction, would recommend this purchase
B007J4T2G8|3.0|after hearing friends talk about this book and well the rest of the world i thought well i need to check it out. i mean i haven't been much of a reader and i need to start and get back into it. why not start with a gaurenteed hit. i really wasn't into it that much. i felt like she was manipulated and abused in a way. not physically. but emotionally. he would come in and make her feel good and then leave and she would cry and feel a lone and he would return make her feel good and then leave again idk just not for me. any way i guess read it and decided just not what i thought when i heard about it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. it is a keeper once  you start you won't stop. and its free it's a fast game so you won't get bored
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think everyone should use this. its awesome. its easy to use its fun to use. I really love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was as exciting as Hunger Games.  Can hardly wait for the third book, Mockingjay!!!!! Fun to read. Great.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|If you have not watched this movie yet, you are missing out on some amazing acting.  It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  This is about black women who endured in the 50's working as maids and caregivers of children in other people's homes.  It is about a group of women who decided that the injustice of how they were treated needed to end and what they did about it.  Most of America may not have even understood or known about the problem nor was anyone willing to tell the rest of the country about it.  It's about women who decided to publish their stories in a book to try to end injustices.  This is so much more than just a movie because it is the not too distant past that is reflected here and it wasn't especially pretty but most of the world turned a blind eye to what happened except for one woman who inspired others to write about their treatment.  It has moments where you will laugh and cry, then cheer these people for their courage.  It is truly about some very brave women and it will inspire you.
B009VB97EY|3.0|If you are expecting the quality of a Steven Soderbergh film, it was was very disappointing. The plot was thin at best, the characters poorly developed. However, if you're looking for a movie filled with Channing Tatum and his very impressive dancing ability, that is exactly what you will get.
B0079R8IYW|5.0|One of the best gift choices I have recently made. My husband is NOT easy to buy for, but this was a great idea and he loves it. Thanks for the brownie points!
B00013AXEE|5.0|Not only is this the best book on writing, it is also an interesting read from an author who understands his craft well enough to explain what works and why in a compelling way.
B000022TSH|5.0|A masterpiece with a don't-see-it-coming ending.  Great performances by a stellar cast, including a young Jack Nicholson.  I wanted this one for years.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love how I can get both written and audio readings in different versions in this app! But, it is lengthier than needs because this ap does not read selected verses only entire chapters ( except psalms. and proverbs, of course). So, I repeat a lot of the readings at the beginning. Oh well, I just tell myself that, maybe,  God intends me to hold these readings more closely.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I am a thirteen year old and love this app this is the best calculator app for kindle fire great
0375842209|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet. I loved this book; it is rich in history and it took me weeks to get over missing the characters. It is so well written; at no time during the read did I NOT have a perfect visual of where the characters where and what their surroundings looked and felt like.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I accidentally bought The Forgotten before this book since I saw so many advertisements for it on the subway. The Forgotten was great! 5 stars! I decided to buy this one since the 2nd book was really good. Zero Day was really good. I give it 4/5 stars because it becomes so technical at the end with the whole plutonium/uranium talk that I felt Baldacci was just trying to fill in pages. Other than that. Great book. Great Series!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all the books in this trilogy. Makes very Interesting reading. Fun way to pass time. Excellent work James.
0393080269|4.0|My husband loved his Christmas present even though received a little late. Will use this company again if ever the opportunitiy.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book talks about a lot of aspects that teens deal with every day: trying to fit in, finding that group of friends that you can be yourself with, dealing with family life, and falling in love. however, there are certain parts of the story that some might find rather disturbing or have to great of a description.<br />  Overall, this is a book worth reading and would definitely be a must-read for all teenagers.
0140131558|5.0|Spellbinding. Totally sucked me in. Auster is my new favorite, taking over top spot from Delillo. Moon Palace is fascinating, but City of Glass is outstanding, mysterious.
B008IZYW3U|5.0|I love the collaboration. I'm glad they reworked it to give us this beautiful music. I think Freddy would be smiling.
0893860468|5.0|Great, great book!! Must read for anyone serious about spiritual progress. Highly recommend this book as a treasure forever. May the Lord bless you in your search!!
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Brilliant as always, love the whole book, could not put it down.Might even read it again and I never do that. The descriptions of the journeys through the Black Isle and surrounding areas were so clear I felt like I was there. When is the next one Ian??
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Wonderful renditions of some classic songs done in typical Amy Winehouse style.  A natural talent with such a wonderful gift, sad to think there will be no more from her.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I found this book one of the most informative books i have read on the subject of wheat and gluten and the debilitating effect on human health.I now understand why I have been suffering from autoimmune issues. Even though the author comes from a medical background he uses terms which are easy to understand and simple. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in learning how to  improve the long term general health of themselves and their family.
B00979CS50|5.0|This is classic Neil, some of the songs are long but all the more enjoyable for it.  This cd more than makes up for some of his more recent releases.
B00821BLX4|5.0|Fit is like OEM well because it is OEM. I am using it with the HOYA filters set. An extra nice suprise was the OEM Dust cap that was included.
B004GEB9UQ|3.0|I bought this book when I was diagnosed with UC and doctor recommended giving the diet a try. I read through the book, and the points the author uses make alot of sense and are really biologically true. I really wanted to give the diet a shot and I tried but I had a hard time with how restrictive it was. I think that purchasing extra recipie books are important to have with this book. The book itself does include recipies but in my case I feel that more variety was needed. I'm not a huge meat eater, and when I do have meat I like it lean white meat. This book LOVES meat, and alot of different kinds of animal parts so there were alot of things I couldnt bring myself to make or try. It's also alot of work and a big lifestyle change. That being said, I still am playing with the notion of trying to incorporate it more into my life because I do think that ingeneral it has some good points but I think its best done on a gradual level. I know that other reviewers have hot alot of success with the diet so it's not completely off the plate for me.
0765325950|1.0|That one wasn't available on Kindle, either!<br /><br />The lack of ebook availability is very last century. I can't help but feel that this is a money grab more than anything else.
B00447G2PM|5.0|I enjoy movie any shows the ocean and al it has to offer. I highly recommend it to everyone to watch.
B008M721MS|3.0|so far, I don't know how to sign on to skype on my kindle fire.  need someone to skype me so I can find out how to use the app.  is there any type of instructions that I can find on my kindle or computer to show me how to use it.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|This is a awesome movie to watch at anytime and anywhere. I would recommend it to all to watch once in their lifetime.
B004QL7K8E|4.0|this movie has alot of energy in it, highly recomend it to anyone! so much music and hard partying teens, makes you wanna be in the movie
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|I love this movie and to see it in 3D was great. II highly recommend it to for all ages.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|i highly recommend this to anyone! please download it if you like downloading youtube vidoes on your phone or other items
B004XZ99LO|5.0|This was a great movie but a little too short and I wish they would have shown more moves in 3D.
B000HT3JNY|5.0|i first saw this movie in the movie theaters, made me cry at the end, bought it on blu ray, did the same damn thing!
B00475BUVM|5.0|This was a very good classic to watch at anytime. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to all ages.
B000EZ7ZXQ|4.0|im sad that the regular dvd had more special features than the blu ray version, i loved watching the music videos and such on the regular dvd, this one is just blah but good
B002ZG98UK|5.0|This was a great movie, the special events were outstanding. It was like you were in the movies with the actors.
B005544V6A|4.0|Most of the new stuff on TV seem to have the same plot line: inhuman abilities to learn and recognize, and a need to save the world from some dastardly villian.<br /><br />Suits is a little bit different. The superhuman part is still there, but it is more of a &#34;normal superhuman&#34;.  The plotline is good, varied, with slight dramatic overtones, but overall has a light hearted character.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|I needed Adobe Flash Player 9 or higher.  I couldn't find it so I tried this one.  It did not work.
1593157134|5.0|Darren Hardy, the publisher of Success, is an amazing and very wise individual. The Compound Effect had been recommended to me when it first was published but I kind of brushed it off till a friend of mine referred to The Compound Effect as the major turning point in his life. This book will lay out how it is not the big events, whether good or bad, that shape our life substantially, but rather it is the little consistencies that create us who we are. You don't become overweight, unhealthy or rich in one day (even though some wish they could, ha ha). It become by the little consistencies every day. It is definitely a book to buy, because you will find yourself turning back to it when you start to find yourself off track. It's an easy read and only 150 pages long (nice sized words and spacing on the pages are easy on the eyes). It my first recommendation to anyone who is looking for a life change. No better way to start off 2013 than to purchase this book!
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I needed Adobe Flash Player 9 or higher.  I couldn't find it for the Kindle so I just downloaded the adobe reader.  Didn't work for what I needed for, but I'm thinking it will come in handy at some point.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down the three books in this series are a must read
B0057MFA42|5.0|I am from Brazil and I bought this blu ray one week ago. There´s not any problem with the sincronized sound with the image anymore. The sincronized is perfect now. This is an excelent blu ray and a must have from the nirvana fans. Good image and sound!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish this book never ended. I don't know what I will do with my free time now. Seriously. No idea.
B008PWUTJC|5.0|The case is as nice as advertised. The Kindle Touch fits perfectly and the Velcro straps stay closed. It's probably weird to say, but it's sporty and perfect for the guy in your life.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have really enjoyed the puzzles. They are fun and I do not have to worry about losing any pieces!
B006885LZM|5.0|I love it even more than I loved &#34;Band of Brothers.&#34;  The production values are just as good but there is more scale in the story than just one company's experience.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A classmate of mine told me about John Green and this book, saying it is a piece of great modern literature. I never thought that I would agree with him for the first time.<br />Green' s work is just amazing, and I think everyone in the whole wide world should read it. Really.<br />Hazel's narration of the so-called oblivion to the letter of Augustus to Van Houten is just WOW.<br />It's simply just a life-changing story about 2 people who have cancer, who falls into the warm and embracing hands of that extraordinary, stupid thing called love.
B003B2H3MC|5.0|It is the 9th-Century and Vikings from the north are attacking everything Christian. Overthrown, the good King of Scandia flees to Britain where his son Prince Valiant (Robert Wagner) trains to give his all to the legendary Round Table.<br />A knight of the table round should be invincible, succeed where a less fantastic man would fail. But before Valiant can prove himself worthy of knighthood, he must first do battle with a traitor who covets King Arthur's throne.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|This was a great book and felt so realistic.<br />The beginning, middle and end were well timed and thought out and all the characters fantastic.<br />If I had one criticism, it would be that Mr DeMille overused Corey's smart remarks and they became too frequent. The good thing about The Lion was that you imagined him thinking the smart one-liners - he didn't have to say them in every conversation. BUT apart from that, it was another amazing book in the Corey series and I will be waiting for the next.<br /><br />P.S. Where is my Mr John Corey???
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a very cute book and very enjoyable to read. I would not recommend it for young adults because of sexual content. I am married and felt that I should not be reading some parts but other than that it was a good book.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Liked the pictures and the way Greg Heffley describes things. Jeff Kinney is a really great writer. I like his books.
B009FBX5M0|2.0|This does not include the theme song by adele. All songs are instrumental, and sound basically the same. This was not what I was expecting as the soundtrack to skyfall.
B008602KQI|5.0|good read for all ages from pre teen to adult ....can't wait for the movie<br />will buy the other ones too
0374533571|5.0|SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK BY MICHAEL QUICK<br /><br />This is a great read for those who have experienced any kind of emotional break and attempts to come back to gain clarity and closure.<br />Pat Peoples had such a break and experienced amnesia --just as well he didn't remember til the end of the book. All through the book he sees his life as a movie that has or must have a happy ending. Life doesn't always happen that way. He thinks getting back with his wife Nikki is going to be the answer needed for his happiness and wellness.<br />Enter Tiffany with her own issues. Tiffany is a widow trying to move on after her husbands tragic death. Pat and Tiffany form a friendship out of need. Let's just say there is a silver lining just not the one they planned on.<br /><br />Brilliantly and poignantly written to demonstrate the reality of mental illness and how people are viewed. There is strife between Pat and his family. They are trying to protect him but it just causes more trouble. Anyone who has suffered a break will really relate to this book and hopefully give those who haven't a better understanding. Football fans will love it too --especially Eagles fans.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Simply not believable during many parts. I understand all about poetic license but a woman who climaxes as she is losing her virginity?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun and highly addictive! You will get hooked playing and before you know it hours have passed! Highly recommend this game.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Must get some of the expansion packs to fully enjoy the more advanced levels of play, once you learn the rules.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I hear of book with a large following, I usually have some trepidation about reading it. Fortunately, this book delivered.
0307704076|3.0|There are much better business/self help, books/authors out there, just look around.  Get your hand on a Tony Robbin's series and this seems like kindergarten compared to graduate school.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|The one thing I think is better about the xbox over the playstation is the controller, so when I saw this one and read the decent reviews, I decided to try it out. It's not good. It fits great in my hands, just like the xbox controller, but it lacks too much in precision and responsiveness. I you're thinking about buying this controller, wait for an improved version (a much improved one) and just get used to the playstation controller.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|takes me back to my childhood. I love playing this game with my 5 year old. Just make sure parental locks are on otherwise kids could accidentally spend real money.
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy is a fantastic book filled with realistic, rich characters, but with a few glaring flaws. From the beginning the book is a little dry, and I admit that I had to force myself through it on more than one occasion. But the reward for that is a deeper understanding of what it means to be a writer and what it means to be human. None of the characters in this book are necessarily likeable, but they are relatable. You can relate to Gavin's desire to say the things he wants, but also his inability to actually do anything about it. You can relate to the awkward sexual adolescence of Andrew, and the heart breaking dissatisfaction that Dr. Jawanda feels for Suckvinder. I've heard a lot of complaints about how dark this book is, but there was nothing portrayed in this book that I hadn't either experienced first hand or heard about growing up. Yes, the things that are spoken of in this book are horrible, but to pretend as if they don't happen is naïve and unfair to Ms. Rowling as an author. It is obvious that she might have been trying a little too hard to write an adult novel, but if she had written anything less it would have been compared too closely to Harry Potter. The Casual Vacancy is a master piece in itself. Once you're introduced to the actual meat of the characters it's hard to put down, and you're left wondering how much you have in common with these people, and what that means for you. It makes you re-examine and also reaffirms what we tend to think of people. It describes a small town (much like my own) so well, that I felt like I had also grown up in Pagford. Yes, this book had a weak ending. And yes, it was a bit morbid and dark, but for her first novel since Harry Potter I was more than impressed and It has quickly become one of my favorite books.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the most wonderful book series to come along in a long time.....absolutely amazing!!!! I just fell in love with the characters and their story and couldn't put them down..... wonderful and left me begging for more!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for the next episode. Love being able to get them early.  It is totally worth it. I have already told all my friends to watch it this way.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Loved this book! It was a great read that never got dull. Can't wait for the next one! Great cliff hanger.
1433523922|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift.  It is being used ALL the time, so glad that this was on Amazon, the price was also great.
B003J27WFW|4.0|I do not enjoy it as much as i though i would it was kinda funny, it would be good if they did a movie.
B00AHG9KYE|3.0|Just an OK story, it didn't fire my imagination like &#34;2001 Space Odessey&#34; did.  I like the main character, it's just that this kind of story needs to be seen on the big screen, not in a book format.!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app delivers precisely what is needed without added fluff or unnecessary complications.  It has a large display and buttons easy to see and operate.  Love it!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|So great to see these 2 characters come back, and continue the STNG stories.  Really good character development, and storyline.  Not what I expected from the Gorn, in a good way...!!
B000MQQMMW|4.0|This is a rare find. I was one of the people that BMG screwed out of the lunch box and bonus dvd. I have the dvd set and it's great.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great continuation to the movie &#34;Hunger Games&#34;.!!!  Love the characters, and their development....!!!! Who would have guessed that Suzanne Collins would make this story &#34;Catch Fire&#34; for me.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|My wife and I really like this show....we are bummed we caught up and have to wait for season 3 to start. We recommend it.
1568363931|5.0|I love this book!<br />I just started getting into making bento and this is a great book with lots of easy recipes that don't require hard to obtain Japanese ingredients.
B007MDB548|5.0|It was a gift to my grandchildren and they loved it.  It was worth the money.  When you have 10 grandchildren it nice to find things that they like.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never cried so hard to a book. Augustus and hazel will forever be stuck in my mind. The love they shared was Turkey beautiful.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This is a great CD.  Of course, I am a big fan of Maroon 5, so it's a given that I would like whatever CD they made.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a CLASSIC and never gets old!! I can remamber playing this on my HUGE desktop computer in 1995. Now its in the palm of my hand:)
1476715904|5.0|OMG I started this book at 8:30 pm and read it to the very last word at 12:38 am.  I have seen this book for a long time, but I have always avoided YA books (books involving 17-21 year olds).  My first experience with Colleen Hoover and a YA book was \\"Hopeless\\" and OMG.. that book was equally awesome!!<br />Ms. Hoover definitely has a style..similar H's and h's between the 2 books (Hopeless and Slammed) but I like it and it works.  Every single word she uses adds value and meaning to her books.<br />I quickly downloaded and started reading Book 2 in the series before work and CANNOT WAIT until I get off to finish it off...before midnight I hope!
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|There are no words to encompass the how amazing this book is.<br />Like every book by Cassandra Clare, with each page comes starting events and emotions.<br />Its leaves you waiting in suspense, cheering with glee, laughing till you cry, crying till you need a tissue, angry till you wish one of her characters were real so you could slap them and so deeply in love that you wish her character was real so you could hug them.<br />Mystery. Romance. Action. Humour. Adventure. This novel has everything. On top of the amazing story line its written wonderfully, raising the novel to (what I personally believe) be one of the greatest novels of all time.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|There is no need for surmising, for the item description clearly states that the season denouement - 'A Journey To The Highlands' - is inclusive, which was the 2012 Christmas Special. Enjoy the third season in its entireity.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is the best book I ever read. I've read all of Ricks book they are the best! Peace
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|it works great, does clean up my tablet very well, files I didn't even know It had downloaded with some apps
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This Must Buy CD for those who love instrumentals with a creative twist. Jon Schmidt and Steve Sharp Nelson (way kool name btw) are wonderfully talented.<br /><br />I was introduced to Cello Wars by my nephew on Youtube and now I am hooked on The  Piano Guys! Cello Wars is a wonderful tribute to Stars Wars music with unique arrangement! Love Rolling in the Deep, Beethoven's 5/Secrets, and Love Story Meets Viva La Vida, also. The mashups are exceptional well done.<br /><br />It is amazing that how Steven Sharp Nelson can play his cello as a percussion instrument.<br /><br />I would love to see The Piano Guys at \\"Live\\" concert.
B004A7QOUE|5.0|Love this video!<br />I used to work out 4-5 times per week but have been very inactive since baby #1 in 2011. This is a great video to prepare me for a VBAC without overdoing it. Other prenatal workout videos seem too slow or whimsical for me. Love her fast pace and variety in movement. I'm motivated to work up to doing the whole 40 minutes without needing to pause for a rest. Haven't tried it yet, but her partner workout looks like it could be an unique bonding tool for me and my spouse.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Enjoyed this slowly paced, well acted and beautifully filmed gem. Like The Others and The Orphanage of these modern day films , The Woman in Black serves up a well crafted take on the haunted house with Daniel Radcliffe lifting this movie up to a Hammer film worthy of its past works.  Its not great by any means but its well worth checking out, the eerie settings, the dilapidated house and the exceptional cinematograpy are especially well done and add in some chilling scenes with the dead children and the lady in black and a twised ending leaves you uneasy. There are a few stand out performances from a local sympathetic couple and  local towns people who want only to get rid of the intruder in their mist. It wasn't how many chills and scares they could deliver but how well they could tell this spooky odd story and let it get under your skin, these kinds of movies needs to slowly take shape,a genuinely scarey story,  well done Hammer.
B0068THAGY|1.0|Lousy story line, boring movie on the whole. I think it was trying to be E.T. but failed miserably. Too dark, awful sound, awful everything! Ugh ...I'm so angry right now that this movie passed through the ranks and made its way to my eyes. Its right up there (or should I say down there) with Lady In the Water.
B00328G4XY|5.0|I first bought Electric Ladyland in 1970, just before learning that Jimi Hendrix had died.  This has always been among my favorite albums, and still is.  I have bought it twice as LP (American, and the English nude cover), once as an 8-track tape, and three times on CD.<br /><br />I don't hear a huge difference between the last two CD remasters, as others have reported.  I was interested in the video, and for determining whether I could hear a difference.  Overall, my previous edition was good enough, and I did not need to buy this edition, but it's still a great album that could only be rated five stars.<br /><br />I have always been curious about the reversed and slowed-down voice at the beginning of \\"...And the Gods Made Love\\" opening track, so I used Adobe Audition to find out.  Edit the sample, reverse it, and adjust the pitch and speed, and, remarkably, a previously unheard bit of Hendrix emerges.  It's quite clearly Jimi's voice in some studio chatter, saying words like (as close as I can tell): \\"...stay there for a second? ... yeah, stuff like that... ok, one more time.\\"  (It isn't really the word \\"stuff\\", but if I used the word I heard, which starts with the same letter, Amazon would not let me post this.)<br /><br />I guess my favorite part of the album is the blues jam around \\"Voodoo Child\\", especially because it features other favorite musicians Steve Winwood and Jack Cassidy, among others.  Overall, this is Jimi's album more than the Experience.  I imagine him alone in the studio experimenting to get just the sound he wants.  And later, with the band, saying after every take, \\"ok one more time\\" in an attempt to make it absolutely perfect.

B005IQZB14|5.0|If you are a hiker, like wilderness journal/diary/memoir writing, are planning on taking a hike, or just like to read about spiritual journeys ---then you'll appreciate \\"Strayed' s\\" book. If you don't have any of those things in common with her,or are not even remotely considering a hike, this is a good story-well told and holds up as a travelogue and very well written overview of the kinds of things long distance hikers experience. It should not be taken as an all knowing guide book, that is not her intention. It is simply her story about her experiences and should be taken at face-value, it would do her an injustice if anyone should critique her work for being too light in the technical details, or too spacey to be serious. Yet, of course, it's  more than just a free-spirit's romp in the woods, it holds up as a true adventure tale. I appreciated this as I've done most of the AT, and have been an avid woods walker all<br />my life. Things ring true, are universal to all kinds of hiking. Strayed is best when<br />weaving her life story into her trail story; this is done with great care, yet she never beats you up with too many maudlin or melodramatic hankie wringing passages. The best thing I can think of---- I'd love to swap experiences over coffee, but would be happy to share the trail with her, anytime.

But once your there, it hooks you and your fate is cast....you must read on.  The Secret Keeper is that type of book.  It was a mystery that was at the heart of this book, and it took until the end of the book to realize what the mystery was.  And it was a total surprise...
B006LSZECO|4.0|I got this book to take on a vacation with the in-laws and I couldn't put it down.  The suspense!  The twists and turns!  The unbelievably messed-up narrators!  It is really a good escape (which is just what I needed sometimes on this trip).  I know a lot of people didn't care for the ending, and I would like to have seen some sort of retribution (I thought maybe Boney would come through, but alas, it didn't happen), but I am OK with the ending.  I can picture the future, when Nick does something wrong that throws Amy into another sociopathic state, but this time he's ready for her and has a few surprises of his own. Or Jacqueline finds proof of some sort and goes after Amy...<br /><br />The one thin part of the novel for me happened when Amy was so blind and stupid while hiding out at the cabins. For someone who so carefully thought everything out, her mistakes in picking her &#34;friends&#34; and dealing with that whole situation were glaring.  How could she perform so flawlessly in many other aspects of her plan and fail so miserably while in hiding?  It led me to believe that she would ultimately be caught and exposed.  The fact that she got away with everything after that was a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />But I liked the book overall and have recommended it to several friends.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Best hidden object game I´ve played on my Kindle. The story logic is loopy is spots, but hints are useful. Just buy it outright.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|the game is free but it is awsome. no problems and i really find it helps me to relax just playing it.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Other than the 'S' word every 20 seconds this was an entertaining movie.  If you've seen the Arnold Schwarzenegger version you'll pretty much be a step ahead of the story.  If you haven't seen it you'll probably find this somewhat entertaining.  Good special effects, good acting, decent story ... it's worth a rental.
0307730697|5.0|Excellent book. Adam Brown is an American Hero. Well written incredible story. Talks a lot about his problems andhow it was only after he came to be a Christian that he was able to overcome, and even than he still struggled. We need more men that cared about there families like Adam did. Very inspiring.
B0036MDNN0|5.0|The tiny dino was a little unusual and that is the reason I ordered him. There was more dino's than the most popular ones and he is one to prove it. He is very well painted and designed.
