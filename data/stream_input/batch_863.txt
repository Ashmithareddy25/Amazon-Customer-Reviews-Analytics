B000062XGB|5.0|This is my favorite movie and I've watched it a hundred times. The dvd was in great shape.
B001M5UDGS|3.0|Got the dvd based on the reviews and in hopes that I might like it...BUT I didn't laugh one time.  The only thing that I've liked of Joss Whedon's work has been Firefly and the movie Sirenity So if this describes you then maybe you should save yourself the money and try to watch it free on the internet.  Yes, the songs were catchy and the actors did great but I wouldn't give it the high reviews that it's been getting...As for Firefly fans...the only other tv show that reminds me of Firefly is the animation tv shows Trigun and Cowboy Bebop...its got the cowboy honor, drama, comedy, and spaceships.  If anyone can think of other shows like Firefly please post a reply comment.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Baz Luhrmann needed to re-think his overly long epic of life in Australia during WW II: The first hour of this  165 minute film comes across as caricature with Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman being introduced as rather overblown, preposterous characters about whom the audience could care less.  But then suddenly the mood changes, the film becomes tender and real and issues of importance are treated well and presto! - an entirely different film is on the screen.  It would be interesting to see this film edited by a major editor who could comb away the extraneous silliness of the beginning and make this film far more dramatic and solid.<br /><br />Though the film begins in 1939 and continues into 1941, it feels like an old American Western flick with cattle drives, and rancher disputes and the development of a classy Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman)  from England traveling to her husband's ranch in Australia to face the failing of her inheritance, becoming involved with the politics of her competitor, finding support from her household of Aborigines who manage her ranch with the able assistance of a rowdy Drover (Hugh Jackman).  One important key element in the film is the emphasis on half breed children (half Aborigine, half Caucasian) who are called creamies and who are shunned by both sides of their inherited genes.  One lad Nullah (Brandon Walter) feels he has no one who cares for him outside of a kindly spirit grandfather King George (David Gulpilil) who gives him support from the shadows of the hills of the Aboriginal land.  The interesting part of the film is the manner in which this young boy pulls the other characters together, even during the Japanese invasion in 1941.  At this point the film becomes an epic worth watching and one accompanied by warmth and tenderness as evil is destroyed and the milk of human kindness rises.<br /><br />Once out of their caricature beginnings, Kidman and Jackman (and Walter) give fine performances.  They are aided by some fine effects from cinematographer Mandy Walker and by a musical score by David Hirschfelder that mixes excerpts from 'Somewhere over the rainbow' with Bach's Hunt cantata BWV 208 ('Sheep may safely graze') and of course the wondrously emotional Nimrod from Elgar's 'Enigma Variations'.  There are elements of information about racism and greed that are treated well.  And by the time this lengthy film is over the audience is left satisfied.  So 5 stars for the second part of this movie and 2 - 3 stars for the first hour  gives if a 4 star overall rating.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Excellent short workout. No excuses now about not having enough time. After almost 30 days, I've worked up to level 3 - which is really hard and I considered myself in pretty good shape when I started. I'm definitely not \\"shredded\\" but that's probably because I'm not on a strict diet plan either. I have seen some changes in muscle definition and I've lost a few pounds. 80% of weight loss is tied to diet anyway, but this is very good way to get the heart rate up and tighten up.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Woody Allen's \\"Vicki Cristina Barcelona\\" is a frustrating mix of a movie.  On the surface, it is smart (Woody Allen, after all), beautifully shot in one of the world's most gorgeous locations - Barcelona and the surrounding Spanish countryside - and filled with talented, glorious actors.    But ultimately, the movie has an emptiness at its core that rankles - namely, why are these people so unhappy?    The story revolves around two ladies who just don't know how good they have it.  If you are beautiful, rich, and able to \\"live well,\\" you should be thankful and able to suck the marrow out of life.  And yet Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) perpetually frown and quibble with life's minor details as they spend the summer in Barcelona (for free!) as they crash at a friend's spectacular villa.    Most of us would feel as if we'd won the Lottery of Life to spend a summer like this.  Things get even better when gorgeous artist Juan Gonzalo (Javier Bardem) propositions the duo with a sex romp - coming from him, it's charming rather than sleazy.  This ultimately leads to romantic crises for both Vicky as she cheats on her hum-drum fiance with Juan and Cristina as she gets involved in a love triangle with Juan and his ex-wife, Maria (Penelope Cruz, in her Oscar-winning role).     Throughout the movie, you want to scream at these beautiful people living beautiful lives - why aren't you happy????  Things are just too good to be believed - nobody seems to lack for funds, nobody has a bad job, and everybody is a cover model.  The nagging unreality of it all ultimately undermines the movie's ruminations on life, happiness, and relationships.    Imagine, if you will, you strive to be a bohemian artist in Europe.  You find yourself living in a villa with Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, developing your art and having sex with two of the most beautiful people alive (as a friend of mine said, the scenes with Bardem and Cruz had both her straight and lesbian friends throwing [.........] at the screen).  How on earth could you ever conclude, \\"this is not enough for me\\"?  Yet it happens in this movie.    I really, really wanted to love this movie, and while I can admire its craft - can I be the location scouter for Woody's next movie, or help light the sets? - the fact that these people are so far removed from any real universe neuters the movie.  The blame lies not with the actors - they are each radiant and talented - but with the yawning void of self-centered narcissism inside each character.  When Vicki and Cristina waltz off in the final scene, all I could say was \\"good riddance.\\"

B000005RS0|5.0|The 1980's. Considered to be a completely disposable era in music, yet so many classic albums have come out of that decade - Purple Rain, Like A Prayer, Thriller, Rhythm Nation, and Private Dancer. Today, Tina still performs to packed venues singing her big hits from this album, and for good reason - this is one of the fiercest albums ever made.    By now, we all know about Tina's escape from Ike Turner, descent into obscurity, and how Private Dancer made her one of the biggest comeback stories ever, so I won't go into all that. We all know how What's Love Got To Do With It became her first and only #1 single in the US and propelled her into legendary status. We all know how the album was certified 5X platinum, making it her most successful album ever. We all know how she won three Grammy awards that year in the categories of pop and rock. I need not go into all that, although I guess I am. Heh.    Private Dancer shows Tina's diverse talents. Musical styles such as reggae (What's Love) to rock (Better Be Good To Me, Steel Claw), R&B (Let's Stay Together, without its success Private Dancer never would have happened, I Can't Stand The Rain, and Show Some Respect), pop (Private Dancer, Help), and New Wave (1984) are represented here, and Tina masters them all with her soulful sexual raspy vocal delivery.    The incredible thing about this spectacular record is how quickly it was assembled once Let's Stay Together burned up the R&B charts and dance clubs. From start to finish, the album took four weeks to make - two weeks to choose and record the ten songs (well, nine if you lived in America in 1984 - Help was a Europe-only release until the album was released on CD) that would be on the album, and another two to finish the album masters. I can think of worse albums that took months, even years to make, and this fantastic smash success was done within a month.    To celebrate EMI's 100th anniversary, many of its most successful albums were reissued in digitally remastered form with bonus tracks, and Private Dancer was one of those albums, and the only album from Tina to receive such a release. All ten of the original album tracks are here, sounding spectacular. But that's only half the story. This release of the album includes four songs recorded before the rushed Private Dancer sessions. These songs, with the exception of one had only previously been available as the b-sides to 45 RPM singles released from the album - I Wrote A Letter was the b-side to Let's Stay Together, Rock 'N' Roll Widow was the b-side to Help, Don't Rush The Good Things was the b-side to What's Love, and When I Was Young was the b-side to Better Be Good To Me. (When I Was Young was included on her box set The Collected Recordings, along with her live cover of Prince's Let's Pretend We're Married, which was the b-side to I Can't Stand The Rain and Show Some Respect. The b-side to Private Dancer, Keep Your Hands Off My Baby, has yet to be released on CD.) In addition, three 12'' extended versions have been included, although I'm told they're slightly shortened - What's Love, Be Good, and The Rain. Their inclusion along with the b-sides is absolutely welcome here.    If you love Tina and/or love the Private Dancer album and you've not yet picked up this album, absolutely do so. It's worth every penny to have this album in sparkling digitally remastered sound with a generous helping of bonus tracks. It's one of the handful of classic timeless albums to come from a decade generally considered to completely forgettable and disposable.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|... Okay, okay, the twits are not bad looking, but I learned long ago, the hard way, that looks aren't everything. I could, if I wanted to start a fight in the comment thread, propose that Woody Allen intended us to take his two escapees from \\"Friends\\" as a biting satire of the airy-fairy mentality of young American women of a certain generation. From that perspective, I'd call VCB a great movie, or at least \\"not bad at all.\\" Honestly, though, I can't say that I would have chosen to spend almost two hours \\"in the company\\" of that pair of vacuities! Hey, here's this product of American education, this tall willowy walking proof that at least 'one woman IS an island,' who is majoring in \\"Catalan Soul\\" or some such recreational pretense of learning, who can't speak Spanish at all! Not even as much Spanish as a Guatemalan gardener speaks English after a month in Scarsdale! That's Vicky. Then there's Christina. I'd believe the portrayal of Christina if only she had 'cutter' scars on her arms.<br /><br />The tour guide isn't Javier Bardem, if that's what you're thinking. It's that mealy-mouthed narrator! That twangy American accent, let's suppose generously, is part of the satire, which is intended to remind of of the pedagogical films shown in American foreign language classes. Oh, you think it was a stylish touch of cinema, do you? &iexcl;Que noci&oacute;n tan ingenua!<br /><br />As for Bardem, well... Woody Allen's projections and wishful self-images have gotten tedious long since, but perhaps this time he's over-reached.<br /><br />I've lived in Spain, by the way, in the university city of Salamanca. I found nothing very evocative or realistic about the sketches of Spain in this film, from the few scenes involving Spaniards other than as passing pedestrians, to the living spaces of the characters, to the travelogue photography of Barcelona and Oviedo.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that I like less and less the more I think of it. It was watchable, in a desultory way, given that I'd paid for it, but if I'd been watching it alone, I would have turned it off in favor of a book.d been watching it alone, I would have turned it off in favor of a book.

B001KVAMM4|5.0|The DVD is the complete length of all three performances. The cameras captured the details of the instrument playing with clear pictures. You can see how Mutter effortlessly danced her fingers and touched the strings. All three artiest's face and body expressions are less emotional. That's what I like. Masur is the same style. He does not jump up and down or distorts his face.    The sound recordings are all perfect. I felt like sitting between the violin and cello when I listened to the piano trio.    My preference on the violin concertor is Cho-Liang Lin's version. The violin is sweet and more feminine. Anne Akiko Meyers is also my favorite.    I recommend Trio Wanderer's piano trios (harmonia mundi) if you enjoy op.49. Op.66 Trio No. 2 is a master piece. I play this CD when I drove to work and I cut the commute time in half.

B0000258CK|5.0|This landmark album from the 70's is one that my older sister owned and played endlessly, using seemingly to tap into an innermost emotional well that only teen-aged girls seem to possess. I just remember that I thought every single song was great and how personal \\"Tapestry\\" sounded to my young ears. Now, almost 40 years later, that weird jumble of teen hormones having long dissipated and my sister well into adulthood, I cam listen to Carole King with an experienced heart and mind, and it holds up as a classic from the era.<br /><br />\\"Tapestry\\" was one of the first albums of the singer/songwriter era that held together as an entity, and now rings pure as a dozen songs that meld into a seamless whole. King had already honed her skills as an ace commercial songwriter with husband Gerry Goffin, and this was her coming out party. As such, the twelve songs on \\"Tapestry\\" run the gamut of the confessional \\"It's Too Late\\" to the committal \\"You've Got a Friend\\" to emancipation (\\"Natural Woman\\"). It's a testament to the staying power of \\"Tapestry\\" that half of this album became hits for Carole and others (especially James Taylor's classic version of \\"Friend\\"), and the others are almost instantly recognizable.<br /><br />It was that identifiable quality that raised \\"Tapestry\\" and, by association, King as a solo artist. It also opened doors for the likes of Carly Simon, Joan Armatrading and Taylor.

B000EWBKK8|4.0|B. Merritt already wrote an excellent review on the story, so I'm not gonna go into that. Instead, I'm going to touch the fact that this movie, sadly, lost all of its bonus content during the transition from DVD to Blu-ray.    Granted, the bonus content wasn't exactly mind-blowing either, but the clips of the cast and crew talking about this production were still very nice. Since this is actually my favorite movie, and considering the massive space that a Blu-ray disc has, I assumed that along with the improved HD video and audio quality, there might be more extra material. Unfortunately, not only is there no such added content, but the bonus content found in the DVD version of the film, has all been completely removed. All of it. 100% gone.    Instead, the only ''bonus'' content is a trailer of a few Lionsgate movies coming to Blu-ray. Wow, how thrilling...    I didn't rate this with 5 stars, due to the fact that they removed the bonus content that had already been included in the DVD, which is stupid, since a DVD can store much, much, much less space.
0810993139|5.0|According to a 3/3/2009 Washington Post article, Jeff Kinney had adults in mind when he first created the concept of this book.  Instead, it was picked up by the children's books division of Harry N. Abrams, Inc. to become a big hit with the preteen set.  DIARY OF A WIMPY KID has especially hit the funny bone of fourth graders.<br /><br />The book is composed in the manner of handwritten journal entries in print (or whatever one calls the opposite of cursive).  Interspersed between the short journal entries are hand drawn pictures that provide the punch line to the vignettes.  Typical set-up: \\"They don't come right out and tell you if you're in the Gifted group or the Easy group, but you can figure it out right away by looking at the covers of the books they hand out\\" (p. 13).  This is followed by a hilarious sketch of two book covers.<br /><br /> The stories are written from the perspective of Greg Heffley, a middle-school boy who is pretty much average in all things except, maybe, self-awareness, in which he usually scores high.  Greg has a best friend, Rowley, whose overly protective parents have contributed to his, well, dorkiness.  Greg feels superior to his friend, but not always deservedly so.<br /><br />Greg is the typical awkward adolescent of much literature about and for that age group, with the additional knowingness of his situation.  It's quite transparently the story of prepubescence through the eyes of an adult who keenly remembers what it was like.<br /><br />DIARY OF A WIMPY KID will be much enjoyed by the ten-year old, if there are indeed still ten-year olds out there who haven't yet read it.  Many adults, too, will enjoy breezing through it on a lazy day.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|There's only one word to describe how this movie makes me feel: enchanted. It's the kind of movie that restores one's faith in art and magic, because it turns an improbable story into a veritable tale of hope, honor, and love. Forget about plot holes or the ultimate impossibility of some of those events showed in the movie actually happening. Because this film calls for more than just suspension of disbelief. It calls for a restoration of optimism and hope. It's for the cynicals and nihilists of the world who believe in nothing and trust no one. It's a must see.
B001QD7SF0|2.0|Ok, I really liked The Rising, it's one of my favorite Springsteen CD's.  But after Devils and Dust, Magic, and Working on a Dream that's 3 strikes for this producer O'Brien.  As many others have written the sound mix is horrible, I can't believe Bruce allowed this out the door with his name on it.    Go back and listen to Born to Run or Darkness where you can actually pick out the instruments and they sound great.  Either The Boss is really getting sloppy in his old age, or this producer has gotta go.
B001C08RHA|5.0|When I was a teenager, I read both Marvel and DC Comics.  My favorite heroes were respectively Iron Man and Batman.  I have yet to see Dark Knight yet, but from what I hear, Iron Man is the more positive, feel good side.<br /><br />The best summer movies are ones that wow you with special effects but also have performances that captivate you, and this one has that.  Sometimes a movie is overloaded with star power to draw you in; with this movie, the stars were selected because of their talent.  When I saw this movie in the theater, the only actor I expected to see was Robert Downey, who was as good as the film critics said he was.  Believe it or not, I didn't recognize Gwyneth Paltrow, though she caught my attention with her excellent performance of Pepper Potts.<br /><br />In the novel \\"Moonraker\\" by Ian Fleming, the villain told James Bond that if a man is bald and grows a mustache, even his mother wouldn't recognize him.  What does that have to do with \\"Iron Man\\"?  Jeff Bridges proves the point in this movie.  I did not recognize one of my favorite actors.  Again, his talent gave life to the role of Obadiah Stane.<br /><br />I have, as I grew up, stopped keeping up with the comics though I am usually interested in the Marvel movies.  When I was a teenager, Tony Stark was captured and became Iron Man in Vietnam.  I learned that the story changed twice since then, and the movie follows the current version of Iron Man's origin.<br /><br />This movie can be considered a little slow in its development.  The real action is at the beginning and towards the end.  This is where the casting helped pull the movie off, because I was kept interested by the portrayals of the actors.<br /><br />Of course, Stan Lee makes a cameo.  There were a couple of hints of what might come in a sequel (Terrence Howard's character eyeing an armor suit and the mention of SHIELD) that would leave a non-Marvel fan scratching his head and wondering what that was about, which I felt was a chink in the armor of this movie.  Also, I felt the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)  These negative elements won't stop you from enjoying the movie.the movie sputtered in its final minutes.  (The editorial review loved the ending -- I didn't.)

B001IF252C|3.0|Update (Firmware 1.03):  Since my original review Apple has replaced this adapter with new firmware revisions, currently on 1.03.  I replaced my 1.01 adapter with the new one and all flickering issues are gone.  I've improved the rating to 3/5 instead of 5/5 because it took Apple a long time to resolve the issue and I discovered the firmware update by accident.  If you're buying new you should receive v1.03.  In order to check in Lion go to About this Mac (Apple sign top left)-> More Info -> System Report -> Graphics & Displays.  Under the display you should see the \\"Adapter Type\\" which maps to Apple Mini Display Port and Adapter Firmware Version that maps to the version of your adapter.       Original review (Firmware 1.01)  I have a brand new Mac Mini(2009) with NVidia graphics card and am using this Dual-link adapter to connect to a 30\\" Apple Cinema Display.  Since the first day I've had the adapter I've been plagued with screen flickering.  The display will black out and come back on every 15-40 minutes while the system is in use.  While this is not necessarily a show-stopper it does frustrate me.  I purchased the base Mini because I thought it would run my 30\\" Display out of the box but of course the Apple store folks informed me that the Dual-link adapter is required.  Considering that the adapter costs 1/6 the price of the whole Mini I'd expect it to work perfectly like other Apple products I've purchased in the past. I'm not the only one with problems, check the reviews for this piece on apple.com.  Apple, you've got to fix this!!!

B001E5CH0G|5.0|I really loved this movie and have owned it on DVD and Blu-Ray. It just doesn't dissapoint, Will Ferrell is truly committed to his role as an elf. It's one of those movies where the whole thing is consistently funny, not one where the only funny bits showed up in the trailer. It's a great film for the whole family, and my family watches it year round!

B000ATQYT2|4.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters when I was little. It one of those things where it's just not Christmas without it. I will note however, I only gave this movie four stars and was very sad to do this but I felt I had no choice. For anyone who can remember the movie from the theaters or VHS you will notice a song has been cut out. I knew about this before purchasing the film (the film-makers no longer owned the rights to the song is what I heard) and it wasn't the best song in the movie (when Scrooge's girlfriend is breaking up with him, the song name is \\"When love is gone\\") but it is still missed. On the whole though, still a great movie.
B000B5IPDI|4.0|Everything's been said about this great Tim Burton flick and the reason I'm writing this review is a bit different.    The RC1 release DOES NOT CONTAIN the senitype or the fridge magnet. The picture above is that of the RC3 South Korean release. The RC1 DVD only includes the illustrated book.    The RC1 disc still is a nice release but anyone who wants the fullblown luxury should look for the South Korean release. Unfortunately that one would be hard to get these days.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|First off this is a GREAT product. Of course it is not the absolute best but this is considered industry standard. Remember, this is mande for studio monitering so it is very..sensitive! Alot of people confuse bad sounds with bad recordings. This headphone was created to find those mistakes! Now I like to use these with my mp3 player. Sound is pure but does show inaccuracy of recordings. The corporate world creates songs that rely on enhanced bass and speaker/headphone \\"glitter\\". I prefer my sound to be as pure and natural as possible. This is a clean accurate bass. I am a bass player so I know a good bass. These have a great bass sound. Mids COULD be better sometimes, but I think it is more of a recording issue than listening issue. Highs are great. You couldn't ask for more in a headphone. If you want to hear your music on a true, entirely natural timbre and sound buy these right now. If you like enough bass to rattle your nads or just don't have a good ear then DONT. If these ever broke down on me, I would replace them within the week.

I wasn't disappointed in the HD quality of this collection. It's truly amazing, but isn't the whole point of a multi-layered, high-density, media like blu-ray to pack as much stuff on a disc as possible? If you already had the \\"Planet Earth: Diaries\\" ready to go, why on Earth would you leave them off? Having seen the \\"Diaries\\" on Netflix DVDs, I have to say, this series is incomplete without them. I'm so disappointed in the BBC for leaving them off. And I'm a little disappointed in Amazon for not telling me this isn't the \\"Complete\\" series.

Now I didn't lose 20 lbs..but I'm also not on a strict diet, I weigh about the same so I think I lost some pounds but because of all the muscle I've built I weigh the same.  Jillian says in the video that the workout replaces hours at the gym.. and she's right!  One of my friends told me she tried the video and was so sore, that she actually prefers to work out at the gym for an hour because she is less sore.  Well, I like to be sore, I feel like all my effort was worth it..   After doing the video so many times, I practically have every word memorized, so I just mute the sound and workout to my own music.    If you are looking for a quick workout that produces results, you will not be disappointed with this video.      I also mix this up with longer videos on the weekends when I have more time.. I bought Jillians other videos Blast Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones.  They are great as well.  I'd recommend anything with Jillian.

B001DHXT6G|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE ORIGINAL STAR TREK SHOW SERIES.  BUT THE REMASTERED DVD OF ALL THREE SEASONS JUST BLEW MY MIND!  THE ONLY DRAWBACK WAS EACH SHOW IS PLACED IN AIRDATE AND NOT BY EPISODE NUMBER.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LOVES STAR TREK AS MYSELF AND PURCHASE THIS ITEM.

B001R10BMS|4.0|Yes, the year was 1983 and Connery, Sean Connery, was back - back in action as James Bond, secret agent 007. Well, the movie, in and of itself, was certainly better than its official franchise competition \\"Octopussy.\\" However, it could have and should have been even better. A long and difficult project from the beginning, it had the good fortune to have Connery as its main attribute. And here he is in fine form looking much fitter, in fact, than he did in the 1971 \\"Diamonds Are Forever.\\" The initial half hour is a breeze that unfortunately the movie cannot sustain in its entirety. There are many fine moments interspersed thereafter but the overall translation of storyline to screen suffers a bit in the execution. Nice touches abound but definite improvements would have been welcome in the way of certain character portrayals along with tighter editing as the film progresses. As previously noted, the Michel Legrand score does not even approach the quality level of John Barry's work. However, with the exception of a few lame and inappropriate cues, it really is not all that terrible. An interesting note is that the original theme song (as sung by Phyllis Hyman) had to be shelved due to legal reasons. A very catchy and Bond-like tune, it is not available as a special feature in this re-release. Try an Amazon.com MP3 download if you are interested. Overall, \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is a fine entertainment that seems (now that the official franchise has eschewed many of its trademark trappings) more in sync than ever before with the entire series.
B000SEGMBO|3.0|I really wanted to purchase this book for my Kindle 2 so I could reference it wherever I go.  Unfortunately, the conversion to Kindle format made it much more difficult to read, mostly due to the fact that the code samples do not format correctly on the device.  I imagine that the book needs to be re-converted to make use of the fixed-width font capabilities that are present in the newer Kindle software.  Until they fix the formatting for Kindle, the print version is the only one I would recommend.
B00127RAJY|5.0|When you only have a short time to exercise this is the best DVD to do.  I always feel like I worked out for an hour and NO OTHER trainer pushes you or motivates you like Jillian.  There is something to her approach that helps me not to quite or slow down.  No other tape has done that for me. And I like that you progress through 3 different levels, it really help me see how strong I was becoming. I just bought her new tapes, I'll let you know how they are soon.
B00005JPY2|3.0|The biggest challenge for directors and screenplay writers --  who are forced to deal with significant source material -- is to make a movie that'll appeal to a broad audience while not alienating those fans who love what the film's based on; in this case, The Watchmen graphic novels/comics created by Alan Moore. Released via DC Comics in 1986 and 1987, the twelve book limited series quickly developed a cult following thanks to the truly graphic nature in which superheroes were depicted. Artist Dave Gibson and colorist John Higgins gave readers gritty images that swerved far beyond the comfort zone of most graphic novel fans, giving us heroes with flaws so grand it would make Penthouse and Pl@yboy Magazine editors blush.<br /><br />The film rights for WATCHMEN were snapped up in 1986 and several production companies, directors, screenplay artists and others attempted adaptations that were promptly shelved. Directors such as Terry Gilliam ([[ASIN:B000KB4898 Tideland]]), David Hayter ([[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men]]) and Darren Aronofsky ([[ASIN:B001TOD9VI The Wrestler]] and [[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain]]) were at different times slated to take on the film, but eventually backed out. Aronofsky I think was an interesting choice, specifically because I so enjoyed his visual take on The Fountain. But Gilliam deserves quite a bit of credit for saying something that rings truer than most. He said, \\"I'd direct the Watchmen if it could be made into a five hour miniseries.\\" Hmm. Considering the extensive source material, that probably wouldn't be a bad idea. And considering the length of this suck@r (163 minutes with an extended version that adds another twenty), one can't help but wonder what Gilliam would've done with it. But, instead, we got Zach Snyder (300) and a theatrical release this year (2009).<br /><br />Not taking anything away from Snyder, he did pretty well with what he got, which was an overstuffed script filled with some sketchy dialogue. But he also had some great visuals and an amazing musical score that really rocked the film on many different levels. The music came from so many sources that it boggles my mind. Nat King Cole. Bob Dylan. Simon & Garfunkel. Jimi Hendrix. And even KC and the Sunshine Band. All of the songs were well incorporated into the story and gave an added flavor to the scenes.<br /><br />One also MUST take note of the film's well-deserved R rating. The F-word is liberally sprinkled throughout, as is the act itself. One particularly steamy scene inside an aircraft reveals every inch of two prime characters, and I do mean EVERY INCH. Violence is rampant, just as it should've been, but parents might think -- this being a based on a \\"comic book\\" -- that it is relatively harmless, Spiderman-like action. Not so. Dismemberment. Superheroes shooting -- and killing -- pregnant women. Rape. All of these are predominantly in the film's forefront, showing us the deconstruction of the superhero mythos envisioned by the graphic novels' original artist, Alan Moore.<br /><br />While the films visual qualities, sound, and music are something for fans to cheer about, the terrible dialogue, rearend-numbing length, and confusing narration sequences pull the movie down quite a few notches. Initially seeming to be Rorschach's responsibility to narrate what's come before and after (Rorschach is a cop with a face only a psychologist could love and played very well by Jackie Earle Haley, [[ASIN:B000N3SU92 Little Children]]), the narration then jumps to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup, [[ASIN:B000MXPE7O The Good Shepherd]]) -- whom I've affectionately renamed Mr. Peni$ -- and back, and then back again to Rorschach. Since we're basically viewing the film via Rorschach's journal, I think sticking with him would've been the best and least confusing way to go.<br /><br />An example of the film's bad dialogue are just too easy to find: \\"I know who my father was,\\" and \\"It doesn't take a genius to see the world has problems,\\" and the lowly \\"Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon.\\"<br /><br />Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the teste$ to move forward and make this film. That, in itself, is nothing short of miraculous. But it doesn't negate the obstacles that could've made this a truly great film. Perhaps a trilogy would've been better?face of Armageddon.\\"    Even with these significant flaws, it's worth praising Zach Snyder for having the teste$ to move forward and make this film.

B0000508U6|4.0|Coldplay's Parachutes is a great body of work!! I would have given it 5-stars, but the sound quality of this CD needs improvement with a serious remastering. Coldplay is not a bass-heavy band, but most of the glaring flaws are in the lower frequencies. Some songs(#2!) sound horrible on transparent systems where they should be magical, it's such a shame because the music is soooo good. For new listeners/fans, I would not let these issues prevent a purchase. This album is brilliant, a classic...which further justifies the need for remastering. Coldplay, pleeeeeeease consider giving this classic the sound quality it deserves!!!
0465043550|5.0|How tall can you expect your children to grow and how rich can you expect them to become? To a parent these are obviously different questions but a statistician will answer both the same way, using a model called the normal (or Gaussian) distribution. It turns out the Gaussian is a good predictor of human height. True it breaks down at extreme values, but it correctly predicts that a very small number of people will be taller than say eight feet tall.<br /><br />On the other hand the Gaussian is a very poor predictor of human wealth or of any financial process. Despite its poor performance, financial analysts have built all modern financial models on the Gaussian. Mandelbrot didn't exactly predict the current economic downturn (nor does he claim to) but he has been saying for decades that the way we build portfolios is fundamentally flawed because of the reliance on the Gaussian.<br /><br />The first part of the book makes the case that the current financial models are flawed. Mandelbrot offers ample evidence refuting the hypothesis that market prices vary following a Gaussian random walk.<br /><br />The second part examines alternative models. Mandelbrot looks at historical cotton prices, at the water level of the Nile river, and at various market bubbles in history. He points out that they are better modeled using a power law than a normal distribution and describes the mechanics of these distributions.<br /><br />The last part looks at the implications. If markets do not follow a nice well-behaved Gaussian, how do they behave?<br /><br />* Markets are turbulent.<br />* Markets are very risky.<br />* Timing matters.<br />* Prices leap abruptly, they don't glide.<br />* Markets work the same way in all places and in all ages.<br />* Bubbles are inevitable.<br />* Markets lie.<br /><br />The book concludes with proposals for future research and how to fund that research.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyo
B000001FA4|4.0|The Unforgettable Fire was perhaps U2's most important record, as it marked the band's first transition towards megastardom.  After providing the world with 3 impressive records, and arguably 2 masterpieces in Boy and War, U2 did not rest on its laurels but embarked on an ambitious journey with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois to create their first experimental record that opened the way to the Joshua Tree and everything else.    Eno and Lanois found The Edge to be the perfect outlet for their love of ambient experimentation. Edge developed an amazing wall of sound with the guitar, using lush texturing of guitar overdubs, drones, chorus effects, echo, suspended chords, added 7ths and 9ths, and fine tuning his melodic sense while Adam Clayton provided the critical backing (and chord changes, since Edge doesn't often play full chords).  Bono found an outlet for his inner soul singer and Larry Mullen Jr. found that he could also play along with synthesizers, keyboards and electronic drum effects.    However, while Eno and Lanois stimulated U2's creativity, the downside is that the record sometimes frustrates the raw anthemic power of U2.  In addition, though Eno/Lanois have helped U2 produce their best records, they always seem to leave great songs on the cutting room floor.  The most egregious example was the band's decision to leave 'Sweetest Thing' off The Joshua Tree (which the band admits was a big mistake).   On The Unforgettable Fire, the omissions were even more egregious.    The first 6 songs on this record rank with any 6 that U2 has ever done.  Pride in the Name of Love is probably the best song U2 has ever written.  A Sort of Homecoming, Wire, The Unforgettable Fire, Promenade, 4th of July, Bad, and MLK are also compelling tracks that have stood the test of time.  However, the record falls apart somewhat on tracks like Indian Summer Sky and Elvis Presley and America.  Furthermore, the true value of the songs was not realized until U2's amazing concerttour, in which they re-worked many of the layered tracks for the live stage, and came up with some incredible arrangements.  The live versions of A Sort of Homecoming and Bad, in particular, trounce the versions on the original record.  Those tracks were so good that the Wide Awake in America EP became a hot seller and helped people appreciate The Unforgettable Fire and widen the fan base.    There were also several great tracks that were left off the original record - The Three Sunrises, Love Comes Tumbling (both of which are on the Wide Awake in America EP), Boomerang, and Sixty Seconds to Kingdom Come.  Each of these tracks is far superior to either Indian Summer Sky or Elvis Presley in America, and if they had been added to the original release, this record would have been regarded as a near masterpiece.    So if you are downloading a version of the record to your ipod, this is what it should look like (in my opinion):    A Sort of Homecoming (Live Version)  Pride (In the Name of Love)  Wire  The Unforgettable Fire  Promenade  4th of July  Bad (Live Version)  Love Comes Tumbling  The Three Sunrises  Boomerang  Sixty Seconds to Kingdom Come  MLK  A Sort of Homecoming (recorded version)  Bad (recorded version)

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great movie, not for the weak hearted or children.  A man, with the ability to go after his daughter and her kidnappers, does just that.  What parent couldn't identify with that?  Taken has just enough story build up to interest you in the characters and give a basic idea of the family dynamic, before all hell breaks loose. It may not have perfect character development to those looking for deep and involved stories, but just the right amount for Taken.  You will be rooting for the character, period.  Once it is started, the action is non stop...realistic action and reactions, with some very satisfying moments I might add.  Without spoiling anything, as a whole it is probably not too realistic (although its a very nice thought), taken part by part very well done.
B001OST0LW|4.0|Many people hate Batman & Robin. I hate it.    Instead of Batman & Robin, GET THIS!    It is so much better, you don't have to worry about forgetting what the plot was like in Batman & Robin, two decent villains, the Riddler played the ridicously funny Jim Carrey, Two-Face played by Tommy Lee Jones.    Robin is introduced in the movie. He is a little annoying sometimes but still makes a good sidekick.    Two-Face: This Two-Face is a LOT less scarier than the one in The Dark Knight (incredibly awsome movie). He flips coins to determine the fate of his victims.    Riddler: He worked at Wayne Enterprises, but had his invention rejected, so he started leaving Riddles to Bruce Wayne, and tries to kill Batman for rejecting (he used a mind control device to find out Bruce Wayne is Batman).    Chase Meridian: Someone who meets Bruce Wayne, and tries to help Batman and Robin stop Two-Face and the Riddler    Also, Val Kilmer plays a GREAT Batman, a lot better than George Clooney, but not as great as Michael Keaton.    It is a little campy, just like Batman & Robin. Batman and Batman Returns were very dark compared to this movie. You really don't need this movie to know that Tim Burton's Batman films were  dark!    Still, it's a good movie with a good cast: Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, Jim Carrey, Nicole Kidman, Chris O'Donnell, Michal Gough, and Pat Hingle.    Definately buy this over Batman & Robin, but make sure to also buy Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Begins, and MAKE SURE to buy the best Batman film, THE DARK KNIGHT!

B001P5Q6F2|5.0|I've been listening to this kind of music and to almost all of its subgenres for as long as I can remember. My favourite bands are Pantera, Machine Head, Metallica, Mastodon, In Flames, Sepultura, The Haunted, Nevermore and of course Lamb Of God. Lamb of God are currently I think on the peak of their career. After creating astonishing albums like As The Palaces Burn and Ashes Of The Wake they were due to create their best album ever sometime. And Wrath certainly is that album - maybe even the best metal album along with a really few others. In Wrath LOG demonstrate an outstanding creativity with their playing being flawless. Their best riffs are in this album and certainly it is a GIANT step forward. I liked Sacrament, but apart from a few tracks the predecessor of Wrath draws its power mostly from the gloomy atmosphere that is evident on the entire ambum, rather than by some truly genuine ideas and riffs. It is a great album, but nevertheless it could have been produced by a number of other bands as well. With Wrath LOG really take their music to next level: 11 tracks that are equally impressive (okay maybe Set To Fail is a bit weak compared to the others) and all in all, an album that will remain unsurpassed. I've never listened to an album before that would make such a positive impression on me from the first rehearsal. This album is Set To Rule..

B000WGWQG8|4.0|First, I will admit I have not read the book on which this HBO series is based, so I am unable to make a fair comparison, as others have done. However, I found the story and characters to be quite engaging, even enthralling, to the point where I stayed up one night and watched the last five episodes on the DVDs. I simply had to keep watching. The acting is excellent (check out David Morse as George Washington -- amazing!) as are the settings -- early America was dirty, bleak and life was difficult, which is superbly portrayed. It is true there are historical inaccuracies in the story, which occurs in virtually all video and film productions converted from the written word.<br /><br />The one grotesque flaw in an otherwise highly recommended DVD set is the totally inappropriate, and inexplicable, use of camera techniques, hence my 4 vs. 5 star rating. What is that about -- the tilted scenes, 45 degree angles, even one scene shot upside down? Quite unnecessary in a series about early America -- more useful in a contemporary documentary, although I still wouldn't like such techniques. Perhaps it's what the artsy film schools are teaching these days.<br /><br />If you can stand watching the tilting scene shots, I do recommend this DVD series. It might even encourage you to read further about the foundation and principles on which this country was created. If so, that alone warrants your viewing of this remarkable series.

Writing math problems that kids can get a hang of. And several successful ad campaigns.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed all of Malcolm Gladwell's books, then you will enjoy this.

B001E75QGG|1.0|I never thought it would happen.  At the end of the first three Indy flicks, it was always the same: My buddy would turn to me and say, \\"One more time?\\"  And I'd say, \\"Oh, yeah.\\"  And we got in line for the next showing.  At the end of this one, when the credits rolled, I muttered, \\"Thank Christ.\\"  And my buddy, who fights to love movies with characters he's loved since we were kids replied, \\"No kidding.\\"  Well, he didn't actually say, \\"Kidding.\\"   I couldn't believe it--I was actually thinking at many points in this long-awaited craptacular, \\"Isn't this thing over yet?\\"  The first five minutes rocked, the rest was just, plain, BAD.  Shia LaBeouf, who was great in Holes, Transformers and is a great actor, was just annoying with his pseudo-Fonzie impersonation.   I was waiting for him to spit on his fist, hit the juke box, and have it play Rock Around The Clock.  C'mon!  The surroundings could have been better. Having Jones in that Malt Shop surrounded by Greasers and College kids didn't just make him look out of place, it made him look old.  This is Harrison Ford we're talking about.  You could still see him punching a Nazi out!  Karen Allen and the character she was reprising was totally mishandled in this movie. I was psyched that she was coming back as the head-strong, opinionated, Marion, who seemed like the female version of Indian Jones.  What do we get?  Marion: The Thorazine Mom.  It came off like half the time she didn't know what dimension she was in.  The Nuclear Refrigerator thing?  I'll let it ride.  It's indiana Jones, after all.  The tree-top driving?  No. Sorry.  The monkeys?  Okay, which writer ran out of ideas?  The Boris and Natasha Russians?  Could we get any more cliche?  I'm sorry, but this was all wrong. I mean, they could have had Indiana older, back in school teaching. Then have something like a group of SS officers who splintered and ran after Berlin fell trying to recover an artifact that would bring back the rise of the Nazi Party, or something like that.  Not Russians who, when they talked, you were just waiting for them to demand, \\"Bring me Moose and Squirrel!\\"  Then the ending...  I actually sat in my seat saying, \\"You've got to be kidding me.\\"  If you haven't seen it, and are dying to, watch it on OnDemand.  Or wait for Cable.  The only upside to this is now Temple of Doom isn't the worst one in the series anymore.  I'm glad this came out before the recession.  If I'd spent seven dollars on this garbage now, I would have been more ticked off than I already was.
B001EO2UKO|1.0|What a great disappointment to see that once such a creative artist is now back just for money!    There's nothing, I mean nothing, good about this shallow release. It is filled with a loss of inspiration and many annoying ways to say what we all already know about love.     I am not sure what made the Editor describe this album as a superlative version of Dido -- and it makes me wonder if the Editor is actually capable of doing their job well.    If you love Dido's previous releases, do not even think about getting this one. This is her version of Apollo 13 -- she must be very lucky that she managed to make her trip home at all!

1846140064|1.0|Mrs. Moyo tries to convince her readers that Africa is poor, not in spite of, but because of the aid it receives. She suggests that the international capital markets, investments from countries like China, trade and local funds are better mechanisms to generate funds for African development. Her message is extreme, her story not always consistent and certainly not convincing. She would have benefited if she had consulted a less political, more professional treatise on the (non) effectiveness and harmful effects of development aid by George Riddel (Does Foreign Aid Really Work?). Her remarks on the growth agenda are 'journalistic' at best. Dani Rodrick \\"One economies, many recipies\\" does a much better job. Finally she hardly delves into the political economy of African societies, which seems to be the most essential element in this discussion. I recommend 'Africa Works' of Chabal and Daloz. In summary, intellectually challenged, but nonetheless a book that will grab the attention because of its message and especially the messenger.
0307269752|4.0|This is a book I almost gave up.  I listened to it on audio, and a few hours in I felt like I was still listening to background and set-up and was anxious for the story to get started.  Thankfully, once it got rolling it was a snowball I couldn't stop. Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander are very interesting characters... very alike in some ways, polar opposites in others.  I spent a great deal of time wondering how their stories would be tied together, and I wasn't disappointed when they eventually were. The mystery of Harriet's disappearance was also very interesting, and the whole story is nothing you would ever expect when the investigation begins. I just had a couple of problems with it... the author tends to refer to everyone by their last name, which is much harder for me to follow.  For some reason, I just don't remember last names as well as first names, so every time someone was mentioned that we hadn't heard of in a while, I had to think for a minute about who they were talking about.  Also, there's a bit of a loose end with the Harriet investigation that I was expecting to be tied up that never was. I was expecting a small twist that never came.<br /><br />Overall, I quite enjoyed this and look forward to reading the next two (assuming the third makes it through translation to English). The ending to this one was sad in a way I didn't expect, and I'm anxious to see what it means for Blomkvist and Salander. If you start reading this and struggle a bit through the beginning, just stick it out... It gets so much better!
0670020478|5.0|As for many others, I've discovered Sir Robinson's work through his amazing talk at TED (google it, it's free and inspiring). Since then, I've sought out any opportunity to hear him speak and have never been disappointed. As for \\"The Element\\", well, it is now my favorite gift for all of my friends and my family.<br /><br />Finding your \\"Element\\" is about finding that magic intersection of your passions and what you're innately good at. We commonly refer to people in this state as \\"in the zone\\", a highly creative and fulfilling state where time flies and \\"work\\" takes on a complete different meaning. Unfortunately, as Sir Robinson points out, our schools and pedagogical methods which were designed for the industrial age often stifle our creativity, and hence most people never discover their \\"element\\". A big portion of the book is spent on the analysis of our educational systems, and for that reason, you'll find many reviewers recommending the book to the teachers. However, to target the educators is to miss the fact that each and every one of us has an enormous impact on the lives of everybody around us: friends, family, and children.<br /><br />The messages in this book are nothing short of inspiring. \\"The Element\\" will help you discover your passions and become a better mentor to your friends and your family. Highly recommended.
031606792X|2.0|The books in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series were my absolute favorite books ever written. The previous books, especially Twilight, kept me hungry for more, and I could hardly put the books down. I began Breaking Dawn with the same level of enthusism. I enjoyed the beginning of the novel, when Bella and Edward were married. The imagery was amazing, and it was almost as if I were at their wedding.         However, i found that the remainer of the book lacked interest. That is because the one question I had been waiting to be answered since almost the very beginning, \\"Is Bella going to be with Edward? or Jacob?\\", had already been answered. By Bella and Edward marrying at the opening of Breaking Dawn, I had less interest for reading the remainder of the book.         In addition, it seemed as if Meyer elongated many sections of Breaking Dawn. There were more details than I felt were necessary, and therefore it was not holding my attention and did not make me want to continue reading. If she had shortened certain parts and kept the book at a fast pace as the other 3 had been, Breaking Dawn could have been a much better book.        Meyer's audience consists of generally teens, and the other books contained many elements that teens could relate to. But in Breaking Dawn, the topics were mainly about happenings after marriage, something most teens could not relate to. While the book was interesting, I feel as if Meyer did not think about her audience as much in this last addition. Overall, I enjoyed the beginning of the book very much, but slowly I began to lose interest as I continued further into the book.

B00005JPY2|4.0|I had a blast watching it. And now, the complaints.<br /><br />Some of the scenes lacked the impact of the graphic novel, strangely enough. The chief standout was the bar scene where Blake gets cut. The damage to his face has been greatly minimized, as though it were a mere scratch, and his words to Jon are devoid of emotional impact. This is the case for many scenes, where it seems the actors are rushing through their lines - a beat or two is sadly missing. This is evident, for example, when Daniel says, \\"What do you expect? The comedian is dead\\" (perhaps I paraphrase).<br /><br />There are some inspired shots, such as when we see Blake's tear navigating the rivulets of his face.<br /><br />The great Plot has been slightly changed, but to no great detriment. There are perhaps a few more left-wing jabs, but the thoughtful viewer will see that the entire constitutes a right-wing cautionary tale about \\"smarter\\" men making decisions for \\"the little people,\\" and how far they are willing to go - to sacrifice (others) - to create a Utopia. There are also jabs at our coddling of evil. So there's plenty to be enjoyed (and frowned at) by viewers of almost all political leanings.<br /><br />The action that has been added all works for the good of the movie, although some of the violence is gratuitiously graphic, albeit in keeping with the graphic novel.<br /><br />All in all, an entertaining translation to screen. The sad thing is that many viewers will not ask the big question - is that the only way to bring about peace in a world of fallen beings? To create false crises, such as global cooling (in the 70's), then warming (80's to 90's? I dunno), then, when the earth started cooling in 2001 (search on \\"Climategate\\"), \\"climate change\\" instead? Perhaps this will be a wake-up call to search for the true meaning of man - the call to be something grander and nobler than the butt of a practical joke, rooted in the realization that our deepest longings are not just chemical illusions borne of atomic accidents, but are for something true and worthwhile that can only be found in Someone greater than ourselves.r something true and worthwhile that can only be found in Someone greater than ourselves.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|This kind of filmmaking confuses audiences with fragile egos. It reduces critics to what they are; critics. If you can watch a movie without picking it apart like a pizza, you have an excellent chance of having a great time. If you can derive pleasure from art, without guilt, there are a variety of films to enjoy and this is a great one. Content aside, Luhrmann has his own style, and a lot of it.
B000HWZ4A2|3.0|Three stars for the comedic value alone!  I saw this recently on TCM ... I had almost forgotten the army of straw men the old atheist and &#34;anti-government&#34; Social Security beneficiary-when-she-needed-it Ayn Rand sacrificed here.  Anyone who takes &#34;objectivism&#34; seriously never moved on from those keen bull sessions in the freshman dorm.  Like, say, Paul Ryan.  But the best part of &#34;The Fountainhead&#34; is watching Patricia Neal go all weak in the knees for Cooper, with his big steely drill and rock-hard integrity!  My favorite part was when she nearly threw the poor dumpy Italian workman out of her room when he came to &#34;fix her fireplace&#34; instead of old (really old) Roark, whom she was expecting.  It's okay, though, cuz he dropped by a bit later and basically raped her.  The speechifying ... the simplistic nonsense ... the straw 'arguments' ... the absurdities ... just a festival of laughs.  The only sobering thing is that so many Republican goobers take this stuff seriously, and foist it on the rest of us.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|I very much enjoyed the way Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris played off each other in A History of Violence.  So when Ed Harris created his own well written and told western, Appaloosa, they brought back the chemistry they had before but this time as friends instead of ex-friends.    This is a buddy movie that breaks all the cliches and finally brings turns and twists that build and yet complete the way they really should.

B001G9F9IW|5.0|I just love Vicky Cristina Barcelona.  First viewed in the theater and then I bought as soon as it was available.  The acting is superb and the scenery of Barcelona is just absolutely beautiful; felt like I was actually there. The cinematography is outstanding!  It is also one of the better moves I have seen in years, and I sometimes think movies just are not that great anymore. However, this is no action movie and the dialog is very important.  My husband did not like the movie - so I have to assume it is more of a \\"chick flick,\\" although I am sure many males would also appreciate this one.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I watched this series on DVD and thought it was fantastic with a really good picture and great sound but the Blu-ray version just blew me away. This is one of the best Blu-rays out there; the picture quality is amazing with all the gritty and dirty scenes and the sound is phenomenal. There is also a great new feature, a picture-in-picture commentary with the soldiers that the mini-series portrays that is very good.

B000W4KT64|5.0|John Waters has a cameo in this upbeat, spirited, revamped musical version of his 1988 screen play.   Via the direction of Adam Shankman (who also makes a cameo appearance), wer are introduced to a hefty, but very self assured teenager named Tracy Turnblad (a sunny Nikki Blonsky, displaying a lot of verve in her premiere film role) as she prepares for school in her working class neighborhood. Despite her run-down surroundings, she is filled with infectious optimism as she expresses her desire to appear  on the \\"Corny Collins ( James Marsden) Show\\", a dance program for teens. It is a good morning in her 1962 Baltimore indeed!   She endures strife from her teacher Miss Wimsey (Jayne Eastwood, who appeared with co-star, Queen Latifah in 2002's \\"Chicago\\") for everything from the size of her fashionable bouffant ( which isn't that high) to tardiness, and enjoys the company of her lollipop-sucking best friend, Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), the child of an incarcerated  father and an overly religious mother, Prudy ( Allison Janney); Penny believes   in Tracey and is content to follow her lead. In turn, she gradually develops her own self assertiveness despite her mother's constraints on her life.   Among the so-called \\"Nicest Kids in Town\\"--the Council members on Tracy's favorite program, are lead singer, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), and Elvis wanna-be, and his not-so-nice Amber Von Tussle(Brittny Snow), the daughter of WYTZ's station manager, Velma Von Tussle( Michelle Pfeiffer).The latter torments Tracy in school as well, and we see how the expression \\"Like mother, like daughter\\" applies as both bully co-workers and Council members into giving Amber, who, at best, is a mediocre dancer, the lion's share of the spotlight, and relegating  R&B dic jockey Motormouth Maybelle( Queen Latifah) and the African American dancers only to appearances on the show's \\"Negro Day\\", the last Tuesday of every month.   Periodic musical song-and dance man, Christopher Walken plays Tracy's  father, Wilber, who encourages her ambitions, whereas her mother, Edna (John Travolta, continuing the tradition of playing Mrs. Turnblad as a man in drag, but still showing those trademark dance moves), an introverted laundress, takes the opposite stance.    When Council Member Brenda(Casie Silver) gets in the family way,and must take a leave of absence from the show, Tracy skips morning classes (accompanied by Penny)to audition for the opening. Despite her aptitude with the dance moves, Velma rejects her because of her girth and support of desegregation, despite Corny's approval of her views. Tardiness results in her being placed in detention, where she is exposed to new dance moves by Maybelle' son,Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), who, along with other Negro Day dancers, practice their moves in detention hall because those in power have no interest in educating them. A subsequent encounter with Link makes Tracy envision a future with him. In the meantime, her newly-acquired dance moves win her a cherished place on the show when she displays them at a record hop hosted by Corny.   Conflict between Velma and Maybelle aries when Negro Day performers, the Dynamites perform the same song as the white Council members, despite the fact the the Dynamites wrote it. Velma decides to cancel Negro Day.   A plus-sized women's clothing saleman, Mr. Pinky ( Jerry Stiller) offers Tracy a job as his spokesgirl, and Tracy urges her reluctant mother to come out of her shell and be her agent.   The Von Tusselle's become more malicious as Tracy's poularity increases and she provs to be a contender for the title of Miss Teenage Hairspray, and for Link's heart. Amber anonymously reports Tracy's trip to Maybelle's recordshop platter party. When Edna goes to collect her dsughter, the equally hefty Maybelle  inspires Edna to adopt a more positive self-image.   In the meantime, Velma tries to seduce Wilbur as he works in his joke shop, attempting to make Edna angry enough to withdraw Tracy from the show. Edna catches them together and is devastated, but it is soon established that Wilbur did not submit to Velma's advances, and the couple gradually make up. In their song, \\"You're Timeless to Me\\", an attentive listener can her starins of \\"La Vie en Rose\\" near the end.   In an attempt to reinstate Negro Day, Maybelle, Seaweed, and the other black dancers, decide to march of the station, and at great risk, Tracy joins them. The high solemnity of this scene is encapsulated in Maybelle's soulful ballad, \\"I Know Where I've Been\\" , whose lyrics, \\"There's a road we've been traveling . Lost so many on the way. But the riches will be plenty--worth the price we had to pay..\\" have a certain power and profundity deeply felt in 2009.    A confrontation with a police blockade results in the arrests of the demonstrators, and Tracy's flight to Penny's house. Prudy punishes Penny for hiding Tracy in their fall-out shelter. But Seaweed and his friends, bailed out by Wilbur, help the girl's escape  and Seaweed and Penny reveal their mutual feelings for each other.   Link acknowledges his feelings for Tracy at the Turnblad's house.   Once safe, Tracy calls home to establish a plan of action, resulting in a spectacular finale at the Miss Teenage Hairspray Pageant, during which Maybelle's daughter, Inez (Taylor Parks), steals the show.   Paul Dooley plays Mr. Spritzer, the owner of the Ultra Clutch Hairspray company, who initially denounces Tracy's desegregationist views as Communistic, but find her to be great for capitalism when she boosts his sales.Ricki Lake, the orginal Tracy Turnblad, cameos as a talent agent, Marissa Jaret Winokur, who orginated the role on Broad way sings at the end, proving this film to be fraught with nostaligia in more ways than one.   Viewers will be treated to a musical as brave and triumpahnt as its plump heroine, and a good time should be had by all!
0316017922|5.0|This book is full of ideas that I have not seen put together compellingly elsewhere, and that can be useful in so many ways and fields, ..education, business, child rearing, personal development, and so on.    So many of the negative reviewers of this book appear not to have read it thoroughly, some are complaining about missed points that were definitely in the book.  This book should not be 'skimmed'! It probably bears re-reading.    You don't have to be a 10,000 hour practicer to see the benefit of that idea, among many others in the book.     For those who complain that the book is not cohesive, perhaps you are expecting  to be force fed the connections, it does challenge the reader to put 2 + 2 together themselves.     So great these ideas are out there. Go Malcolm, Go Malcolm!
B001DTUU7A|5.0|A great Dr. Seuss movie, far better than \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\\"  The digital copy is a great added feature to this blu ray.  I have loaded the movie onto my ipod and it can be accessed for, \\"children please be quiet\\" situations.  Digital copy is a must have.  Make sure you keep the insert.  Over all the movie is very kid friendly with no violence to speak of or inappropriate language that I can recall. Amazing visually and I found it quite clever too.
037571457X|5.0|At first when I opened this book I was completely skeptical.  The first thought that crossed my mind was, \\"Really?

It is witty, whole-hearted, and sincere.<br />This book is great for bookclubs, ungrateful teenagers, women, friends, anyone wishing to understand Iran, etc.<br />Makes a great gift.  I found it to be more compelling than the film.
B000007NYS|5.0|I bought this CD way back in the late 80's. Might have been when Mary Chapin Carpenter told David Letterman that when Lucinda was on he'd better be nice to her - or else! It's one of my top 5 albums of all time. I can't get enough of it. Hard to believe the disc still plays. I love every single one of these songs, and Lucinda's delivery is so passionate and real that I don't like the versions other singers have done of her songs.<br /><br />I love a lot of her other songs as well, but this one has a special place in my heart. I'm so glad to see her get some of the recognition she deserves for Car Wheels and others.
0061122416|5.0|This book will be many different things to people.  For some it may be a mystical cautionary tale, for others it will be an explanation of human behavior.  This story is universal, and will evoke a spectrum of reactions from readers.  It defies culture, gender, and conventional wisdom.<br /><br />This book is a necessary read for book clubs, classroom discussion, and personal growth.  It is chock-full of symbolism, literary elements, and one-liners- allowing readers to benefit in a different way each time they reread this text.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I grew up listening to ABBA and always loved the songs. Now I own this movie and the first time I watched I sang along to all the songs! I've had people tell me that the plot was cheesey.. Well I disagree! I LOVED this movie!   In fact I have watched it over and over! To me it's right up there with The Sound Of Music! I mean come on, who can honestly say that Mama Mia is not better than The Music Man?! Musicals are meant to be fun and this is truly fun, funny and romantic all at once.     Peirce Brosnan and Meryl Streep make a great couple and for those of who can understand the kind of relationship between these two characters Mama Mia is AMAZING!!!!
0312539517|3.0|Archer's fictionalized story of George Mallory and his attempt to summit Everest was an enjoyable read. Having read most of Archer's novels, this book lacks some of the detail I liked in other novels (As the Crow Flies and Kane & Abel) about the main character's life and relationships. Archer rushed a bit through the story of George and his wife, but I think this was an attempt to keep up the pace of the novel. It did, however, reawaken my fascinating with mountain climbing and the sheer self-will so many posses to overcome weather of ice, snow, and severe wind to summit incredible heights. While its not the best Archer book, it is worth a read that will be fun and quick paced.
B001ILHY2C|5.0|I think Jason Statham has acting talent, he just usally takes roles that don't let him use it.  Movies like the [[ASIN:B0019EXZYE The Bank Job [Blu-ray] + Digital Copy]] is where he gets to act.  Films like Death Race is where he gets to fight.  That being said, he is very skilled at action and martial arts.  This film is a guilty pleasure; nothing more, nothing less.  For me, Paul W.S Anderson is a hit or miss director. Part of what makes this film a hit for me is less fake CGI; and, more practical effects.  Death Race moves along at a very fast pace, which is essental for a popcorn filck; it does not give you time to look at the flaws.  There is a ton of brutal violence and car crashs; with some gore. The title, Death  Race, says it all.  Slow motion is used often; and, there are qute a few big explosions before all is said and done.  The strongest acting is done by two of the supporting cast members; Ian McShane and Joan Allen, but the real stars are the cars and the guns.  It's your basic story of a man wrongly accused and imprisond; who has to fight for his freedom.  The plot is full of cliches; but, is still very fun to watch.  On to the Blu-ray...the picture quility is very good; and, the audio is excellent.  You can hear shell casings falling all around you; and, it has a very powerful sound track.  The extras leave you wanting more; but, the few you get are cool.  Both the theatrical cut and extended version of the film are included via seemless branching.
B000068TPN|5.0|Awesome!  I enjoyed reading the book more, but this is another amazing movie that pretty much did the book justice.  A true story of some brave and amazing American heroes.
1416550518|5.0|This book was great! I throughly enjoyed the historical aspect of her writing as well as the suspense that she wove into each chapter. If you like books with shocking endings, then this is a must read!
045122499X|5.0|Read his book \\"The Pillars Of The Earth\\" first.Don't let the size scare you. \\"World Without End\\" follows after his first one.  It clearly tells you what life was like in 1300\\"s. It is not one you can easily put down.   I enjoyed both books very much.I know it took a very long time to write these books, but I sincerely wish he will do another.
1591391105|4.0|I was preparing for a cross-country move from work at one level in one type of non-profit organization to work at a higher level in another type of NPO.<br /><br />This book gave concrete suggestions for ways to prepare for my transition, as well as to manage the various elements of the transition now that I'm in the middle of it.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to other management-level professionals making transitions between jobs, positions, or companies (or all of the above, as in my case). I would also recommend reading it a week or two before you begin your new job - there's much advice for the first few days in the position, so if you wait until your first week on the job to read this, you'll miss out on some of its value.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|If you love Stravinsky or the Copland/Bartok/Shostakovich/etc variant of 20th century music, you must buy this for the sheer price performance.  If not, buy it anyway and listen to the pieces in chronological order, progressing to the next piece only when the current piece makes sense to your ear.  (Skip the [very early] Symphony in E-flat, and be prepared for a few clunkers.)  Be ravished.
0380820846|5.0|I read the novel before this installment. Personally, I like to read books in a series, and I've enjoyed several of the Bridgerton books. I especially liked this one. It was well developed, and I, too, was surprised to find out just who the writer of the gossip sheet was. Never suspected a thing! They can probably be read out of order, but I prefer order. It makes more sense to me that way. Love your romance books, Julia!
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Alanis Morissette, you don't get better than that. Its been so long since a CD you wondered what was happening. Now I like country, blue grass, and rock and roll, and I guess at it she bridges a piece of rock and roll, but not really. Her songs are way past normal stuff of rock. It doesn't have deep down (soul?)in it. Anyway, for CD buyers out there, you need to buy this CD, and study it! Soon you'll feel that this CD is just...Really Cool.<br /><br />Gif
B000084T18|5.0|This is in my opinion the best rap album of the decade. It is a masterpiece and a MUST have for any hip-hop fan.

B0017ZB8M6|4.0|Over the summer of 2008, I had the pleasure of interning at a very prominant radio station in central Massachusetts; one that played Katy Perry's \\"I Kissed A Girl\\" seemingly nonstop.  Because of that, I avoided buying the album at all costs.  One day though, almost on impulse, I purchased this debut album my Ms. Perry and overall, I was pleasently surprised by what I heard.  What I like most about her and her music though, is the fact that she's not mainstream, yet she is (if that makes any sense!) Anyway, here's my track by track review of \\"One Of The Boys.\\"    1. One Of The Boys - Kicking off the album with the title track was a very good move in my opinion for Katy.  In this track, she spells out things that make her more of a tom-boy than most women, yet she IS a woman and isn't ashamed of it.  Good vocal range showcased here, and very well produced and mixed.  4/5    2. I Kissed A Girl - The big hit single off the album.  This is the song that originally turned me off on the album after hearing it over and over.  Although it is clearly driven and produced to be a radio single, you have to admit, its pretty catchy.  Here, Perry begins to show her quirky ways in singing with mixed signals.  4/5    3. Waking Up In Vegas - I like this song.  The beginning shows some of what Katy can do in a sort of acapella way.  Albeit she again has the quirky feel to her, but the song has a very good tempo to keep things going.  Not the strongest, but good overall.  3.5/5    4. Thinking Of You - This is a ballad of sorts, and after what seems like a shaky beginning, this song is very, very good.  For a moment the quirkiness stops and Katy just sings.  This is one song where she seems to hold nothing back vocally and as a listener, you can really hear what she can do.  4.5/5    5. Mannequin - Again, a very strong vocal output from Perry on this track; in some ways stronger than the previous track.  This song also has a funny, and good message; people shouldn't be so fake.  Overall, mixed with her vocals and solid production, this could be a surprise gem on the disc.  4.5/5    6. Ur So Gay - This was the \\"official\\" first single off the album, released via the internet.  This is a very, very solid track.  Not only is it hilarious, the message is strong as it pokes fun at the scene of popular culture and all thats wrong with it.  Very good song.  5/5    7. Hot 'N Cold - The other big hit off the album following \\"..Kissed...\\" Again, one of those songs clearly made for radio, but still very strong.  I think its Perry's vocals on here that make the song standout.  A pretty solid rock anthem for the women as well.  5/5    8. If You Can Afford Me - Not the strongest outing by Perry on this track, but the harmonizing is done so well that any stumble is covered up very well.  Strong message and overall, not a bad song.  3.5/5    9. Lost - This is another song which I believe could be an under-rated gem.  A ballad-type tune, Perry again shows that she has the chops to run with the best.  The harmonizing is strong in this song as well, it almost has a haunting feel to it.  If I had to compare, I'd say almost Sarah McLaughlin-like.  Very good song.  5/5    10. Self Inflicted - I wasn't crazy about this song the first few times I listened; after awhile though it grows on you.  I don't agree with the placement on the album and believe it should have been put earlier.  To me there are elements where Katy seems to struggle with trying to get everything into this song and it seems cluttered.  Not bad, but definetly not the best.  3.5/5    11. I'm Still Breathing - Perry jups right back with a strong output here.  Again, a somewhat haunting track with a solid message.  What  like about this song is the overlapping vocals which harmonize very well.  Solid production throughout.  4.5/5    12. Fingerprints - This would have to be the only way Katy could end her debut album.  much in the same vein as \\"One of the Boys\\" this song is very catchy and has a solid message.  4/5    There you have it, a very solid outing for katy Perry.  Once you take a listen you'll see what I mean when I say that she's mainstream without being mainstream.  I like her, she's a very fresh face for a very saturated music industry where everyone seems to be carbon-copies of everyone else.  I highly recommend this album for anyone who likes music; and this is from a guy who's a metal head!
0399226907|5.0|My Granddaughter owns this book and I am really impressed at the reading it teaches!  She had completely memorized the entire book by age 2 and 1/2.  I highly recommend this book.  It is adorable and wonderfully illustrated.  You won't be disappointed.
0143038419|1.0|You have to really like someone to put up with their extended, detailed descriptions of self-discovery. Otherwise, they come across as hugely self-absorbed and self-centered. Despite Ms. Gilbert's proclamations throughout the book that she is extremely likeable, that she has many, many friends who find her likeable, and that even God finds her likeable...she comes across firmly in the `hugely self-absorbed' category to me. Some of her descriptions of people and places are funny and worthwhile, but mostly she's like listening to an annoying pseudo-friend who asks you `how you are' because they really only want to tell YOU how THEY are.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|The concert is amazing.. Queen at it's best.. plus the 1985 LIVE AID famous 17 minutes of QUEEN... Need I say more???<br /><br />  If you're a fan, buy it and enjoy, if not a fan, buy it AND LEARN and see history in the making!!!!
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Even though I think there is far too much sexual activity in the later seasons, I still love the show.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|This movie has grown on me over the years and has become one of my favorites in the realm of suspense and horror.  The Blu-Ray edition  helped take it to a new level with a much better improved sharpness and depth, though not as consistent as other Blu-Rays.  It has some moments when it doesn't have that 'wow-factor' that other Blu-Rays have, but again for this type of movie and the atmosphere it is great.  I am glad I purchased it on Blu-Ray.
1416562605|5.0|In this cynical `from rags to riches' story, Aravind Adiga brushes in big strokes a bleak picture of his homeland India. The outcome of the alternative `eat or get eaten up' does not depend there on what you can or what you know, but on what you can give or who you know. In one word, corruption (bribes) is the key factor: `To be called a murderer by the police! What a f... joke.'    The democratic process is fake: `A handful of men in this country have trained the remaining 99.9 per cent - as strong, as talented, as intelligent in every way - to exist in perpetual servitude; a servitude so strong that you can put the key of his emancipation in a man's hand and he will throw it back at you with a curse.'  The main character in this book is a `white tiger' and escapes his fate, because he `was corrupted from a sweet, innocent village fool into a citified fellow full of debauchery, depravity, and wickedness.'  He becomes a Bangalore entrepreneur `straight and crooked, mocking and believing, sly and sincere, at the same time'. His prerogative now is `to break the law of his land.'    In his colorful, hilarious, obscene, `straight from the heart' language, Aravind Adiga depicts a ferocious battle between religions, castes, races, nationalities, colonial forces, haves and have-nots in a human jungle without pity.    Highly recommended.
B001G1ACVY|3.0|This album isn't his best, but still enjoyable. I found too many of the tracks slow, almost sad. Coyotes and Butterfly are great, but none of the songs seem to allow him the creativity he's shown in the past. Where's the suburban white-boy rap?
B001E7OO2I|5.0|LOVE ME SOME JOHN LEGEND  - GREAT CD
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I love this CD and playing it brings back the fun of the movie. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that one of my favorite ABBA tunes, Chiquitita, has been left out. It's a charming part of the movie so why not on the soundtrack?
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|This film was so entertaining that I watched it twice and purchased the DVD and CD.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Mickey Rourke wears his soul on his skin.  I am an extremely passionate artist, that is what an authentic artist does.  The character Rourke plays might have come off like a cartoon character if a lessor actor had played the part but Rourke infused the role with so much depth, compassion; he comes across naked and raw, his soul on his skin and Darren Aronofsky  was clearly a genius as a director challenging Rourke to give a performance of a life time and perhaps life saving one at that.  The cinematography is excellent as well.  The men wearing lycra look like they take steriods yet they join Rourke adding compassion to this film that is deep rather than cartoon like.  I wish Janine was cast as the female lead and make up artists worked hard to make her look dowdy because I wanted a female lead that matched Rourke.  I wanted her body to tell her story the way Rourke's body does.  The end would have ripped that much more although I love the last scene and soundtrack was great too especially because these musical artists donated their music to support Rourke's well deserved comeback.  I do want to warn you two scenes were too bloody for me and I closed my eyes.  I had a chance meeting, a NYC moment with Darren Aronofsky, shook his hand and quietly congratulated him as if he had won The Oscar.  I said , Mickey Rourke wore his soul on his skin.
B001ASVXSE|5.0|For the money, you really can't do much better - this is simply a steal. This man was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. The recordings here are crystal clear and beautiful-I listen to the cds in six channel stereo mode on a Yamaha receiver - what a joy! 17 discs full of absolutely stunning, captivating music - full orchastra, trios, sonatas... a smorgasborg for the classical music lover.     I have listened to the cds from start to finish - honestly there is not a bad one in the package. True, I do have favorites, but I never felt while listening at any time that I needed to stop listening. My point is that all the music is enjoyable...all the music is pleasant to the ears.    Once again, 17 cds of beautifully rendered music for such a reasonable price - buy this boxed set - you'll thank me and the others who have made it a part of our collections - make it a part of your collection!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This is the best concert DVD that I have seen. The sound, the lights, the guests, it takes me back to my concert going days. This so good it can bring tears to your eyes. There's a lot of soul in this performance, and it comes through on this DVD.    I was fortunate enough to see Floyd twice, Carnegie Hall (who remembers \\"Dr. Squegee?\\"),and Roosevelt Stadium. It's good to see (most of ) them again. Buy it without regret.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Like others, I saw this movie when it first came out and found it confusing, lacking in logical flow, and basically a mess. I am well familiar with the period in question and felt very sad that the opportunity to shed a bit of light on historical events was missed so completely. I watched the Director's Cut last night and was stunned that this was the same movie. How could anyone in their right mind butcher a film so totally? Such a shame that for monetary reasons this film was  destroyed. Yes, it was \\"dramatized\\", yes, much \\"license\\" was taken with the characters responses to events, nobody Christian, Muslim, or Jew was ever that benevolent, thoughtful, or altruistic. But Baldwin and Saladin did exist and the peace they held in Jerusalem was real. Balian of Ibelin, Raynald of Chatillon, Guy of Lusignan, Sibylla of Jerusalem; all are true historical figures. It would behoove us all to know more about the history of not only the Middle East but of the world. Only then will we stop this madness of fighting the same bloody conflicts over and over and over.
B00005JPY2|4.0|It's five minutes until midnight on the Doomsday Clock. The Cold War between the US and Russia shows no sign of thawing. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) can no longer see the future and he believes the reason is nuclear holocaust.    One of the last masked superheroes takes a fall from his highrise apartment to the ground below. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) was a precarious mixture of good and evil and someone finally took him out while he was watching television.     The US government led by 5 term president, Richard M. Nixon (Robert Wisden) has outlawed masked heroes. Only Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is still on the streets trying to fight crime.  He's trying desperately to find the man who killed the Comedian, but none of his old co-horts seems to care.     This is just the setup for \\"The Watchmen\\" Spring 2009's predicted blockbuster.  The film, which runs at an impressive 163 minutes, is based on Alan Moore's acclaimed graphic novel.  The director, Zack Snyder, used a great deal of Dave Gibbons's original art as a storyboard for the film and it really does show.      Two of the most compelling actors in this story are Haley as the crusading Rorschach, who still believes in the superheroes and helping his own, and the Morgan, who plays an intense Comedian whose actions make one wonder why even Rorschach wouldn't be better off just walking away.     The CGI for this film is spectacular, but be warned, the action is quite real and not for the squeamish or very young. Violence against women and children is particularly rough, but faithful to what I remember from the originals.  I admit, seeing real actors conveying the story is quite a bit different than looking at one dimensional drawings and for me, the film had much more impact.     The music is some of the most evocative of the 60's, 70's and 80's, including \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen and \\"Sounds of Silence\\" by Simon and Garfunkel.     I can't speak to the faithfulness to the original work. I read the story back when they were still comics and CGI wasn't even a gleam in a geek's eye.  And yet, so many of the characters and thoughts from this novel have haunted me for years.      I will probably see the film again and will definitely purchase the soundtrack.  \\"Watchmen\\" is well worth 3 hours of your time and if you're like me, you will be thinking of the film for some time to come.    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
0930289234|5.0|I thought this book would be something only teenage boys would be interested in, but I was completely wrong. The Watchmen is one of the most creative and original graphic novels I've ever read. It's every bit as revolutionary and distinctive as Maus.<br /><br />The cast of superheroes have a variety of powers and very different temperaments and origins. The Comedian, whose death starts the events that lead to the tragic conclusion, is totally abhorrant but you like him anyway. Jon, the man made superbeing, is what we're used to in terms of superheros. Rorschach is self made and is as inflexible in his opinions and actions as Nite Owl is open to change and the opinions of his fellow Watchmen. Ozymandias is cut from the same cloth as Rorschach in terms of thinking that he knows everything. But Ozymandias actually does know everything.<br /><br />This book reads very quickly and the art is wonderful. The art very often conveys emotions and forecasts events that the dialogue just can't. If you've never read a graphic novel, The Watchman is a good starting place because it's so good. I wish all graphic novels were as good as this one.

0747593779|4.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is extremely well written, and has a plot that really keeps you guessing.  I enjoyed reading it more because of the style than because of all the horrible things that happen to Mariam.  At the same time, I loved the irony that is intrinsic to the action in the book -- for example, Haroun al Rashid was a great ruler, but Rasheed, the man Mariam marries, is not an agreeable person.  I wonn't spoil the book for you by telling you everything that happens.  Just read it, you won't regret it.
B00005221M|5.0|This was one of those movies I didn't expect that much when I first saw it so I was pleasantly surprised. Since then, it has skyrocketed to nearly the top on my list of all-time favorite films. I can't think of too many other adventure films that are better. Just a great, great movie.    It boasts an interesting story filled with intense characters, beautiful scenery, a fantastic score, good action and a nice romance. So....there is a lot to like about this Michael Mann-directed film.    The action scenes are quite realistic, and border on being almost too prevalent, to be fair. However, even if it may be a little too intense or frequent, the action is always interesting and varied, from all-out assaults to individual battles.    The story takes place in Eastern New York State but, in reality, was filmed in beautiful Smokey Mountain areas in Asheville, N.C. This movie looks spectacular and with an epic, sweeping soundtrack is quite a feast for the eyes and ears.  Boy, I hope a great Blu-Ray transfer is done on this film.    The eye candy includes a handsome leading couple: Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe. Wes Studi is mesmerizing as the \\"bad guy.\\" If you liked him in \\"Geronimo: An American Legend,\\" you'll like his work here.    If you are fairly young and only know Michael Mann through his crime movies like \\"Heat\\" or \\"Collateral,\\" please check this earlier film out. It could be Mann's best, which is saying a lot.

I went ahead and bought this blueray disc because I wanted to see Mariah in HD. I was impressed by the great superb video quality. Its just amazing to see Mariah specially in the opening song. Its just like having here right there in front of you singing looking soo beautiful and sexy.   What I like about this blueray and this concert is that you see a very mature, proffessional and yet very fun Mariah Carey. You get a taste of both new and old material in a refreshing way. You will have some fun with songs like \\"Its like that\\", \\"Dreamlover\\", \\"Shake it off\\", \\"Honey\\" and you will also even feel nostalgic with songs like \\"Dont forget about us\\", \\"My all\\", \\"One sweet day\\" and \\"We belong together\\".     Gp ahead buy this great concert, its worth it. Its Mariah Carey!!!
B001OQCV74|5.0|Don't worry about losing your buttons, worry about losing your eyes and having them replaced by buttons. Admittedly \\"Coraline\\" is not my cup of tea; I found it overly long, repetitive, and too downbeat, but I appreciated the brilliance, cleverness, originality, innovativeness, and great imaginative leaps taken in the movie. It has a touch of theater of the absurd, but also it had a touch of the Grimm Brothers' grim fairy tales.<br />The stop action photography used is fantastic.<br />You're never sure whether you are in a dream world or not because key things happen right after Coraline goes to bed.<br />Having your eyes removed and buttons sewn on is the worst thing that can happen to you in \\"Coraline\\" because you thereby lose your soul. Coraline lives in a gloomy old house along with tenants in the basement and a tenant on the top floor. The basement tenants are two old ladies who apparently were vaudeville performers, and there is a fantasy scene in a theater where we see them scantily clad as a trapeze act. They are funny, eccentric characters, but seem to me to be aimed at an older, more sophisticated audience than one for the kiddies.<br />There are all sorts of incredible creations (spooky spider things), and it is unquestionably a work of genius.<br />The upper floor tenant is a circus performer who trains mice who performs in a circus tent scene. There's a talking feral cat and a nice kindly boy Coraline's age in the movie.<br />Coraline's parents are self-absorbed yuppies who have no time for her. The mother never cooks a decent meal, and the father is too busy at his computer keyboard. Her second parents seem so nice, and the mother is a great cook (the corn on the cob looked delicious), but, as it turns out, they have buttons as surprises for her. Instead of losing her buttons, Coraline fears that she is going to lose her eyes and gain two control buttons that she doesn't want.<br /> This film has scary, creepy stuff, and a thematic melancholy that may be off-putting and tough sledding for young children. It's difficult to say who the audience is for this work. Kafka enthusiasts? Fans of Beckett, Genet, and Kurt Weill? Absurdists? Gloomy Guses?<br /> We see so much about dysfunctional families that we soon get to see the abnormal as the norm. Critics loved this movie, but the kids I saw were puzzled and made uneasy by it and yet ironically stayed glued to the screen.edding for young children.

0307269752|5.0|The reviews I read had me unsure whether I would enjoy this book, and I was surprised to find myself drawn in so immediately. It was so difficult to put this book down, and the story had me so engrossed that it entered my dreams.<br />I was sad to learn the author passed away, but am looking forward to the next two novels in this series.<br /><br />The plot moves a brisk pace, and I did not find its meanderings to be especially predictable, either (a few sexual situations aside).<br />I know NOTHING about Swedish life and even less about finance. Another author's detailed explanations of both could have easily bored or distracted me, but Larsson managed to make them interesting topics and even characters in their own right.<br /><br />The characters are all flawed and believable. The possible exception to this is Lisbeth. She is nearly impossible to relate to and little is explained about how she became the way she is. Somehow despite all this, she became the most 'real' character to me by the novel's end.<br /><br />I would place this novel is in a category with \\"The Thirteenth Tale,\\" \\"The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox,\\" and \\"The Historian.\\" It is a tense read, a deep and layered mystery. At times it is sexually-charged, at times disturbing, and often both at once. It is not an upsetting read however.. there is enough balance between the light and dark aspects of the story.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great thriller with dark overtones. Most readers won't let the sometimes ugly themes overwhelm the mystery and intrigue of the novel.

B0014KD46W|5.0|From 1986 to 1988, Steve Winwood rode a wave of popularity and critical acclaim.   The wave began with the release of 1986's \\"Back in the High Life\\" - which proved to be both a commercial and critical success.   The wave continued with the release of his popular 1987 greatest hits' album, \\"Chronicles\\" - and then spilled over into 1988 with his follow-up album \\"Roll With It\\".   In 1990, Winwood would release an album that I considered a masterpiece - \\"Refugees of the Heart\\".   However for some reason, the public did not embrace this album and it found its way to the CD bargain bins due to poor sales.  From \\"Refugees\\" up until 2008, Winwood would not enjoy the same level of success that he did during the 1986-1988 period.  In 2003, Winwood would bounce back with \\"About Time\\" - a Latin infused album that gave Winwood a bit of a bounce back.  However it would be five years later that Winwood would have his biggest success since that 1986-1988 period.    Sure, he got a boost from guest guitarist Eric Clapton, but this album is pure Winwood.  It proves that Winwood still hasn't lost his touch .  The release of \\"Nine Lives\\" would not only generate commercial sales, but in my opinion should have seriously garnered Winwood consideration for 2008 Album of the Year.    The one thing I truly liked about \\"Nine Lives\\" is that it is a throwback to Classic Rock and Winwood's early solo career and Traffic days..  Better yet, it proves that Classic Rock has not died.   Much of the credit goes to the outstanding guitar (with some help from Clapton) and bass work that just has the feel and elements of Classic Rock.  Combined that with some trademark Winwood Hammond Organ and some of the leftover Latin/Jazz infused work from his previous album it blends to make another Winwood masterpiece.  While many may not consider the Latin/Jazz infusion to be a Classic Rock, I disagree - namely because of the way Winwood incorporates the Hammond Organ and guitars into many of the songs, it will have a Classic Rock feel.    The title \\"Nine Lives\\" takes on two meanings - this is Winwood's ninth solo album and there are also nine songs on the album.  Here is a song by song synopsis of this collection.    \\"I'm Not Drowning\\":  One of the big complaints I have about today's Rock is the overuse of the acoustic guitar.  Yes this guitar uses the acoustic guitar, but it combines very well with some bass and unique percussion.  In a lot of ways the percussion is acoustic - but overall the music blends perfectly.   This song will soon catch on you quickly.  One other point this is a true \\"solo\\" song by Winwood as he plays all of the instruments    \\"Fly\\":  This is the longest song on the collection all of collection clocking in at 7:48.  This song has a near 1 1/2 minute instrumental to open up the song.  Some great use of the saxophone and whistles on this song.  This song probably doesn't resemble a classic rock song too much, but it's still very good.    \\"Raging Sea\\":  I love the way the bass sets the tempo on this song - it almost a funk sound to it.  This song sounds a lot like Winwood did early in his career.   Nice use of the Hammond Organ on this one.    \\"Dirty City\\":  This song is not only a great song, but it was one that really merited serious consideration for 2008 Record of the Year.   This is just a good bluesy guitar/Classic Rock (this is where Clapton makes his guest appearance) sounding song.   Great use of the Hammond Organ and percussion again.   Winwood's vocals are perfect for this song as well.  This song basically gives a clinic on instrumentation.  Shame on the Grammys for ignoring this track.    \\"We're All Looking\\":  This song doesn't have much of a guitar influence as the Hammond Organ is going to take center-stage.   This song also shows some of the \\"carry over\\" of the Latin influence from Winwood's previous album - \\"About Time\\".    \\"Hungry Man\\": This song also shows some Latin (to some extent a Latin Jazz) influences and Hammond organ.  I foundthis song to be another throwback song to Winwood's earlier solo days.  I also found this song to be a very catchy one.    \\"Secrets\\": This song also follows the Latin-infusion heard on the previous song.  This song also had some great guitar work combined with the Hammond Organ.   The highlight of this song is going to be the incorporation of some Flute work.    The result also sounds like a throwback Winwood song.    \\"At Times We Do Forget\\": This song also has more use of the Hammond Organ combined with some more Flute stuff.   This song didn't quite have as much of Latin feel, but it still very much had a Jazz infusion.    \\"Other Shore\\":  I found this to be a very smooth and mellow sound.  More use of the Flute and Saxophone on this track.   This was a very nice way to end the album.    The liner notes include the lyrics to all of the songs as well as musician credits.   Overall, this is one of the highlight albums of 2008.   I'm completely astonished than when Album of the Year nominations were handed out - that this album did not make this list. Overall this is one that I would highly recommend.
B00004U8JV|5.0|Had seen the movie with commercials on cable...and wanted it to complete the trilogy. Actually really enjoyed this one more than the third take.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|The movie begins as did most of its promotional advertising showing the Grimm Brothers being heroes.  Alas, they're frauds, charlatans who bilk money out of local people while the Grimms pretend to vanquish witches and anything the villages live in fear of. As just desserts the brothers are nabbed by a French General (Jonathan Pryce), but instead of punishing them, he uses them for his own designs. At this point my interest in the film waned considerably as Damon & Ledger appear to be nothing more than frightened mice (even appearing dressed as scullery maids while they are forced to scrub floors by the french soldiers). The ending does have a pay-off as Ledger eventually musters up the courage to save the day, but it took so long to get there, it was a waste time and my money and these days that's saying a lot!
B001N3OCV6|3.0|This soundtrack is pretty good and most of the songs are used well in the movie (especially All Along The Watchtower) but My Chemical Romance's cover of Desolation Row is one of the worst things I've ever heard. They should have used Dylan's original for the closing credits.
B000O77QD8|5.0|Excellent movie.  Brings home the fact that the military is really made up of a bunch of kids.  Thank God for those kids.  The movie is a bit fragmented and can be confusing if you haven't read the book.  I would suggest reading the book first
B002GTZSZU|5.0|I saw this movie several times in the past and could not pass up the opportunity to see if Blu-ray would contribute much.<br /><br />This is a unique approach to the life and contributions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is told through the filter of an acquaintances' Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) of who struggle with god. In addition, we seeing the movie of course may miss some of the play but being a movie we have replaced them with visions of Prague, where the movie was filmed.<br /><br />The only thing that can be a bit annoying to some people is the laughing style they gave Mozart (Tom Hulce) in this production.<br /><br />Be sure to watch the extra information where the different actors and the director tell about the trials and tribulations of getting a film crew in to Prague 1984 and having to deal with the secret police.<br /><br />Get a different view of the play in Midsomer Murders: The Death of a Hollow Man<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0013DS9NS Midsomer Murders: The Death of a Hollow Man]]
B00006I53S|3.0|I originally reviewed this as a consumer who had no idea about photography.  Now I have some knowledge and have upgraded to the 24-70 2.8, and this lens now sits as a in case my lens dies emergency.    Overall, for a beginner on a budget, this is a good lens.  Way better then any kit lens.  The zoom ring is loose and slides around very easily when you do not want it to. If you want a narrow depth of field (when only a small amount of the image is in focus) and you are on a budget, get the 50 1.8 lens instead.  But if you are looking for a good quality walk around lens this is great for a beginner or casual photog.    pros- good quality lens for price  cons- does not open up enough, loose zoom ring
0316143472|4.0|I have been hearing that I have to read Sedaris for some years now. Not a big listener of the radio I had no idea who he was. So when I found this available on audio, when I was looking for something light I finally decided to give him a try. And guess what?? I freaking love David Sedaris. I laughed out loud so many times while driving in my car that I am sure I scared more than one driver.<br /><br />This collection of essays was funny, sad, poignant, sweet, cute, and hysterical. One story after another with Sedaris doing the reading, it was just a great way to spend time in the car.  The scary thing is wondering who is watching you and taking notes- Sedaris bases his tales on people and events that he has observed, his notebook and pen always handy to jot down a few notes. The story entitled Solution to the Saturday Puzzle was one of the funniest I have ever heard and I wonder what the star of the piece, Becky the nasty plane seat-mate, thinks of it- if she has indeed ever seen it.<br /><br />The ending essays, which cover Sedaris' trip to Japan in order to quit smoking, run the gamut of emotions and were also among my favorite pieces. I just downloaded Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim to my Kindle. I want to compare the listening experience to the reading experience because I so enjoyed listening to Sedaris' rendition of his stories. I think I have found a new favorite, and that always makes me happy!
B000000H64|5.0|It's very simple.  I'm not really gonna go into the cd, it's landmark.  It would be foolish to compare them to Corey from Slipknot, for one of the songs... \\"Zero Signal\\" was on  the first Mortal Kombat movie.  Remember that?      Yeah.  Quite silly.    I am instead gonna sell the band to you.    Burton C. Bell:  To me, one of the greatest vocalists in metal.  He was a trained opera singer.  He can growl with the best of them, sing with the best of them.  Very multi-dimensional.  A great lyricist, too.  He captures the beauty of simplicity, I don't think I can think of another who can write like him, very simple... But manage to be very deep.    Dino:  Very distinctive sound, you know when you're listening to him... However, it wasn't all that... Simply put he's no longer in the band and he's been replaced by the bassist Christian Olde Webber... and well... Maybe if I didn't tell you, you wouldn't know    Christian Olde Webber:  Bassist, now guitarist.  Every bit as good as Dino.    Raymond Herra:  Let me put it to you this way.  One of my favorite things to point out when people listen to this cd is that the drummer is human.  The expression is priceless, because well... It sounds like a drum machine.  He sounds synthesized.  As in not human.  If a drummer doesn't sound human, how good is he?  That's pretty amazing if you ask me.  I saw them live, and I didn't know whether to crap or go blind.  One of the greatest drummers in metal.    PS:  I left that concert a bigger fan than when I walked in.  You know a band is good when it's like that.    Buy ANYTHING buy them ESPECIALLY this cd.  If you aren't hooked by the first track, then nothing is gonna do it for you.  You WILL find better songs on the cd, but I am a firm believer in starting by track 1 and going through.      One of their landmark songs is Replica, which is track 4.  Pisschrist is very legendary (an even better live experience) Body Hammer has one of the grooviest riffs, and Zero Signal... It's a brilliant song.    Words won't do it, you simply gotta give it a spin.  You'll thank me
630522885X|4.0|I saw the newly restaured print yesterday in Antwerp, on a big screen in the filmmuseum and it is certainly worth it, the colors are indeed very vivid and it was an unique chance to see this in the original cinemascope...I understand that this restauration is going to come out on dvd later this year..;and although that is not quite the same as seeing it in the cinema I can only recommend viewing it if you get the chance..;for me it was not quite the great masterpiece I had expected, the story is a little too coy, the lead actress a little too undercooled and although the script keeps announcing the famous scandals of Lola the action is too subdued and stilted to warrant more than a mild yawn in these slightly more demanding days. This woman ends up a freak show and I understand the criticisms on the heartlessness of fame and a public ambiguous morality but in the end this is the story of a 19th century gold digger who got what she deserved and even a little more...so this is a film of style over substance, beautiful colors, composition and camera work..lovely!
B0002OERI0|4.0|This wasn't a purchase for myself.  It was a gift for someone else.  I'm told that it arrived on-time and in good condition.  So, everyone is very happy!  Thanks!
B001AII4RM|3.0|You cannot have too many versions of a classic \\"Beowulf\\" handed down verbally for many years and eventually written around 700. It was suggested that the story when written down was by monks and may have been altered for their purpose. Some versions are too far in left field; yet other versions or views can enhance the story. This rendition was just downright fun to watch.<br /><br />Yep this is the old English story of heroes and monsters.  You may find a few differences as who was Grendel's father. In addition, Angelina Jolie gets to play a seductive mother.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie relies too much on the GCI gimmick (with a video game look)and many well-known actors.<br /><br />The version I watched is the director's cut and Blu-ray. Some good DVD extras help fill in the missing parts of the story.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000UYX4OK Beowulf & Grendel [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B001AQT12G The 13th Warrior [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:0393320979 Beowulf: A New Verse Translation (Bilingual Edition)]]
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I didn't have high expectations for this film, but was totally pleasantly surprised.  This was such a treat.  The acting was great, especially the talented Robert Deniro.  I highly recommed this film to people of all ages!
0920668364|1.0|As a new mother, I was given this book by a relative at a family function. After opening and reading it during a quiet moment while there, I was caught between laughter and horror (though I kept both reactions to myself) and quietly questioning the sanity of the person who gave it to us. When we got home, I shared this book with my husband, and then friends, who all had the exact same reaction. A very odd, disturbing tale of a mother who starts off fairly normal but slowly becomes the stalker of her own growing son (perhaps she was always doing this but ran out of outside targets? Hey, on that note, it never actually does mention what happened to the father...). I am at a loss as to how readers, and so many, are giving 5 stars to this paranoid, stifling tale but hey, to each his own? All I can say is that the day I find my MIL (a nice, sane lady BTW) climbing in our bedroom window to rock and cradle her son is the day I run off to call 911.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|You will think you're immune. You'll be sure you're too cool for this. You'll try to tell me this is another low-budget, over-hyped internet fluke. You may even convince yourself that you'll be able to take another shower without lapsing into an a capella \\"Brand New Day\\".    You're wrong.    This bizarre, eccentric, funny, odd, and oddly sweet musical has more plot in about 45 minutes than most movies have in 2 HOURS. Fun characters. Addictive songs. Great plot twists. Delightfully snarky sense of humor. A finale that'll knock you on your a**. AND the BEST last two notes in musical history. It's Joss Whedon at his best and in his element. No wonder it went viral.    So why get the DVD? DUH! Extras! \\"Commentary, the Musical\\" has as much snark and sass as the main event, and the actual commentary is like CliffsNotes for any aspiring filmmaker who wants to shoot a great film on a shoestring budget. Joss believes in putting art back in the hands of artists. If for no other reason than that, the man deserves your $10. The fact that this is one of the best things he and his crew have ever done (and that Neil Patrick Harris has an unexpectedly fantastic voice) is just bonus hang.    Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Learn the words. Sing along. Obsess over the awesomeness that is Whedon-esque Easter Eggs.     Cool is overrated anyway.
0060935464|4.0|This book starts of a little slow when the characters are being developed but gets much better as it gets into the meat of the matter. It is nicely written and the story line is very strong. It really captures racism back in the day and turns it into a compelling tale/reality...
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Outstanding,   Reminiscent of Fat of the Land with a new mega-man sounding twist, and the album is all energy.  Great album from top to bottom, no tracks worth skipping. Wall crumbling bass.  Top 4 have to be omen, thunder, take me to the hospital, warriors dance.    I had been a fan of a few tracks in between fat of the land and this, most definitely Spitfire, and First Warning, however this album is a gold mine. It took a good twice through the album to appreciate the genius of it. It doesnt feature a lot of long verses from flint or maxim (mostly short hooks) so that sways it a little more to the electronica/pop side of things rather than the electronica/punk side.  I use pop for lack of a better term, however, the word pop probably shouldnt even be used to describe it. This stuff will melt the face off of a britney spears fan.
B00005JPY2|5.0|Were there no comic of Watchmen in existence and this film had just appeared as is in it's current form it would  be hailed as a masterpiece. Sure this is just pure speculation on my part but my point is that the only way one can be critical of this film is to nit pick it against it's source material tit for tat. To go to the theater and sit and see it anew as a film while trying to \\"forget\\" the comic will bring about a wholly enjoyable moviegoing experience. Of course one can not forget the comic if you have read it. It's something many of us have read, absorbed and assimilated.<br /><br />As far as the comic goes I can not stand the coloring and to a lesser degree, the art. I do not care if you disagree with me on this point of if the art and it's coloring were also meant to be as they were to harken back to the comics the book itself was paralleling in it's alternate version of comic reality. As an artist myself I enjoyed art before words. I still buy my current comics and graphic novels first and foremost for the art. As a writer I understand the value of a good story but with graphic novels there needs to be a complete balance. The dated coloring and small paneled Watchmen comic do not and never did have the impact on me that this new film has. I always loved the comic and still have my original but my tastes have matured and the film has now become the new version of this story for me. I re-read it before seeing the film and found the film more powerful and visceral that the book ever was. When making a film of a book you had better have something to add to make the film more than the sum-total of the book. God does this film deliver.<br /><br />I go to movies because I enjoy them. I tend to go to films I am pretty sure I am going to like. I stay away from stuff I am sure to hate. Also, and this is important, I do not go to the movies to walk out and say what garbage something was. Sure I see garbage just like everyone else does, and sure it's subjective what one person likes and another hates. To want to go to see this film, watch it, come out and say it's utter garbage, well, there is no talking to you. If you enjoy the comic and hate this I am not sure what you wanted, or how you would have done it better. Every (important) scene from the book was there, acted well, shot well, uncluttered by Tom Cruise stars, and presented coherently telling the tale. And anyone arguing that it was too close is off base too.  Much was reinterpreted with contemporary values, contemporary cinema, and current and also timeless issues all in mind. Action scenes were not shot panel for panel but fleshed out in a way that made sense.<br /><br />This film was also made by someone who cares about such adaptations like no one else never has. Care and reverence has been given to this and 300 like no other comic to screen films ever have. Many people, throngs of people (mostly pro journalists) who never read the original when they were kids have skillfully grabbed a copy, quickly sifted through the WATCHMEN book they would have, or never desired to read on their own and have now written reviews as if they are experts on both the book and it's now younger son-- the film. You need to want to read the book and want to see and enjoy this film to be qualified to review it. Some stuffy journalist who hates all comic films and bows to Batman Begins and The Dark Night as some masterpiece simply because they were told it is one and also because Heath Ledger died are not the people I want to read reviews from.<br /><br />And if you never read the book and you tend not to like comic films, please, stay home. Save your pennies for what you like. This film is not for you.<br /><br />For any who are missing the cut parts, the missing comic, and more: DO NOT DESPAIR! These missing parts will be added. We live in a world where money, yes money, is the driving force behind many decisions. A 4 hour epic that could only play 3 or 4 times in a day is just not economically feasible. Zack Snyder has got your back, cares as you do and will be editing in missing scenes, and the comic, for a summer release and of course a DVD/ BLURAY release down the road. To all those that say a film does not read like a book and you can not skip around, wait for the DVD/BLURAY. Then you can skip to your hears content, pause, and hey... even rewind, just like a book. If you think all writing should no be done on the screen well steer clear of just about all movies out there.<br /><br />Now if after all this, you see the film and find it utter drivel garbage but still love the book, well there is no talking to you.  I can only wonder what floats your boat and what you would have made if given the chance. zack snyder sits alongside peter Jackson as someone who fully immerses himself into the art he is creating. This film has a soul that breathes loudly and will have a very long life. It will also help to change cinema, comics, and bring old stories that sit abandoned as screenplays, short stories, and comics to life on the big screen, if for only the simple reason because the studios see that this worked and other stories like and as brainy as it can work too.<br /><br />One final point I'd like to make is that if Alan Moore hates all graphic novel to cinema interpretations and will not even let his name go on his baby, how has this guy let each and every work he has created slip from his fingers and become films? Makes little sense. J. D. Sallinger and Bill Watterson sit at home quietly with their creations safely their own and have never relinquished control. There is no film of The Catcher in the Rye. There are no Calvin and Hobbes toys or animated shows.

1932907009|5.0|I bought this book after much back and forth on whether I should or not. I am glad I did.  I don't feel this is the definitive, end-all-be-all that some people seem to think it is but it is a good primer on structure - an area I always struggle with.  He gives you a beat sheet that is easy to stick to and explains his reasons for what he says.      This is an easy read.  I read it over a couple of days.  It's not overly complicated nor is it overly technical.  If you want a basic primer on structure, I recommend this book.
0143034901|5.0|This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time. It surpasses the two requirements I demand of great literature- it's extremely well-written and is very interesting.<br /><br />What Will Draw You In:<br />- This novel is an example of how the mystery genre done right; it's not a cheap \\"who dunnit\\" novel, but instead a carefully crafted web of lies, deceit, violence and passion.<br />- The love stories are romantic without being nauseating.<br />- The characters possess a great deal of depth and are well-developed.<br />- One must appreciate the \\"story within a story\\" framework that has been so carefully constructed.<br />- The novel's narrator, Daniel, allows the book to maintain a humorous tone.<br />- Anyone who loves books will be enthralled with the idea of such a place as the Cemetery of Lost Books, which is where Daniel finds book which truly changes his life.<br /><br />If You're Being Nit Picky<br />- It is a long novel, at over 500 pages<br />- The end if tied up a little too neatly, although that is a usual characteristic of the mystery genre.<br />- There's a recommendation from Stephen King on the back; don't let this scare you away.

0060589280|4.0|\\"Eleven Minutes\\" is the second book I have read by Paulo Coehlo. Although the beginning to middle was pretty fascinating and passionate, I still felt that the ending was too forced and quick. Overall, it was still an enjoyable read and something different. My rating: 3.5/5 stars.
B00005JPY2|5.0|This is a near faithful adaptation of the famous comic mini-series from the 80s. It's a very dense, nihilistic narrative, and the average movie goer who shows up expecting something like The Dark Knight or Spider-Man will be disappointed. This story is violent and dark.     It's also adapted from an arguably brilliant written piece of fiction, so the dialog in the movie will surely be interpreted as verbose or pretentious by the unfamiliar, unsuspecting audience member.     For hardcore fans, the ending has a significant change, but to some degree you can see it as an improvement from the original work. I think the filmmakers did an excellent job on this adaptation, though I think the average audience member who is unaware of the story may be alienated. Highly recommended for those wanting to experience something Hollywood typically doesn't offer to the masses: a smart piece of visual cinema.

1439102813|5.0|The book - Still Alice - is beautifully written, a heart-tugging story that takes us to the lonely and mystifying road of the Alzheimer's disease. it is a scary journey, though, and broad in scope, because it exposes us to the dark side of the brain landscape. And in the process, we find ourselves rooted for Alice Howland's speedy recovery with a sublimal candor and hopeless hope.   Lisa Genova's strenght lies in her uncanny dexterity to keep us hooked to this tale of human odyssey, leaving us at the end with a jolt of inspiring and soul-searching feeling that leaves no room for illusion, uncertainty, or mystification. As a new and powerful voice in literature, Ms. Genova rocks and succeeds with passion.
1591841666|4.0|Very short and easy to read book.  Lack of any supporting facts or research makes the book come across as a gross simplification, if not preachy.    It is basically, a simple concept explained on less than 80 pages.  Sometimes we do hit the hard times at work and in life. In most cases all you need is persevere and you'll be back on the right track in no time. This perseverance is what will separate you and the competition.  Knowing that a certain amount of perseverance is necessary to achieve perfection will allow one to evaluate whether the project in which one is about to engage is worth it.    Interesting advice provided on avoiding easy growth - if it is easy for you, it will be easy for others and competition will soon ensue.    Less one star for the lack of any kind of research...

0765350386|5.0|After reading Brandon Sanderson's debut, Elantris, I was compelled to read his other works. The first entry in the trilogy, Mistborn, has not disappointed in the least. In the Final Empire, you'll find a stirring tale of a broken world where humanity lives in constant fear, subjugated by the fallen hero from a desperate era. The cruelty of this mad emperor creates a new hero with one purpose - to destroy him. Brandon Sanderson is one of the most creative fantasy writers I have seen in a long time, and this book tackles class-warfare and reverses the traditional fantasy archetype of the Hero's Journey. If you enjoy fare a little bit more complicated than dragons and princesses, this book is for you.

0143038419|5.0|This was such a good book. I especially loved the ending. I really didn't want the book to end. I took my time reading it just to try and make it last.<br /><br />There are 3 books (or sections) to this novel, and I personally enjoyed book 3 because there were so many interesting characters that were fun and quirky. I really enjoyed Book 1 alot, but 3 was my fave. Even though there is no real ending to the story, it still feels like a happily-ever-after tale to me.<br /><br />And there are so many great and hilarious quotable lines in this book...too many to mention them all. Just make sure you have a pen and paper or a highlighter handy when you read this because you'll want to remember them.
B00005JPY2|4.0|This movie offers plenty to like and a little to dislike. On the liking side, it does a great job of adapting Moore's complex story to the big screen. Of course, a few things had to be sacrificed, but what came though seems true to the 1980s original. As a comics movie, you might expect a major effects-fest, and the CGI crew delivers brilliantly. Most of all, Moore's original vision of switchback plot twists and moral ambiguity comes through as jarringly as it did when the original mini-series came out, back in the 1980s.<br /><br />That's also what some viewers will dislike. The movie addresses complex issues that we still face, including war, crime against women, and deciding whether ends justify means. Like the real world, this doesn't supply easy answers. The viewer isn't supposed to come away certain that justice has been served or that the good guys won. That's where I find another incongruity. The story addresses deep issues, but does so with shallow characters.<br /><br />There's a lot more to say about Watchmen's place in graphic novel history, but this isn't the place for that discussion. It's a good story, but it aged. This movie brings that story to life beautifully, but carries those signs of age with it. Go ahead, enjoy this one (at least, the parts you're supposed to enjoy), but don't expect it to change the universe of comic book movies.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

1590171993|5.0|By now the readers of these reviews should have a good sense of what this novel is about: very little.  A sweet, shy farm boy goes off to college, switches from ag school to a&s, studying literature; he stays on to take a Ph.D., is hired by his school and begins a life of teaching.  He marries, ecstatically at first, but, soon, tragically, has a contretemps with his department head that lasts for twenty years, has an affair with a junior colleague, loses her under pressure from the embittered chairman and weak but friendly dean, settles in to a largely successful teaching career, sees his beloved daughter escape from his wife and home through unmarried pregnancy and eventually dies, as the one book that he has written falls from his hand into the silence.  This is not a million laughs.<br /><br />The novel as a form has been successful for a number of reasons.  First and foremost, the novel broke with the literature of the renaissance in demonstrating that the life (both interior and exterior) of an average individual (=a middle class individual) could be compelling and instructive.  This is, quintessentially, Stoner.  His simple, sad life is told in a compelling narrative that is extremely engaging and his emotional life is charted with the intensity of an action/adventure film.<br /><br />Thoreau said that all men lead lives of quiet desperation.  Certainly, the characters in Stoner all do.  The desperation is not, however, period-specific.  The narrative spans the period of two wars and the great depression but there is none of the alienation of high modernism or the existential angst that often marks the works of this period.  We are on the plains in central Missouri and life is hard enough without any European or Hollywood overtones.  Life itself is struggle and if Stoner is subjected to the punishments of his embittered, troll-like department head, he is spared service in combat as well as the life on the farm to which his father and mother eventually succumb.<br /><br />The book is very, very sad, but it has glimmering moments and Stoner's personal form of courage (which may not always serve his best interests) stands as a small but inspiring monument to the human spirit.  The most striking aspect of the novel, to me, is the absence of religious faith--whether as a force for hope and grace or as a force that fails in times of greatest need.  It is simply absent and its absence is not felt (as it is, e.g., in The Great Gatsby).  This strikes me as a curious but interesting aspect of a novel set in this place and at this time.  Bill Stoner could have used its help.  The world of the novel, however, is too stark for the introduction of religious, indeed, even vaguely 'spiritual' realities to intrude.  If Edward Hopper had set out to write a great novel of the midwest, it would look and sound exactly like this.  James Ellroy sometimes uses the phrase 'tragic realism' to describe certain forms of fiction.  Here it fits.  This is a very important book, but steel your mind for the experience before you embark upon it.very, very sad, but it has glimmering moments and Stoner's personal form of courage (which may not always serve his best interests) stands as a small but inspiring monument to the human spirit.

B000UGG39Q|5.0|\\"A great riff is something you know instinctively. It has energy, and attitude, and sex.\\" -- Jimmy Page.<br /><br />Even though it was initially intended to be just a part time side-project for vacationing members of Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Eyehategod, and Crowbar, New Orleans, Louisiana's Down actually evolved into a full-time project whose music was capable of standing on its own. It also became one of the more important heavy music groups of the Nineties. In fact, with their debut, 1995's \\"Nola,\\" and alongside the latter two of the aforementioned bands, Down more-or-less can be attributed with turning the music world on its ear, and being an integral part in spearheading that decade's Southern sludge/doom metal revival scene. This scene would go on to inspire a truly vast number of followers. (It would probably be safe to assume that pretty much any sludge/doom metal collective that has formed since the mid-Nineties sites \\"Nola\\" as one of their favorite records.)<br /><br />So, what have Phil and the gang (which is completed by the seminal two-headed guitar monster that is Pepper Keenan/Kirk Windstein, bassist Rex Brown, and Jimmy Bower on drums) been up to lately? Falling apart, mostly. Like most side-projects, Down was almost immediately put on hiatus in favor of the band members' respective day jobs. Thus, after the release of that iconic debut, fans didn't get to hear anything new from them until several years later. They finally did return in 2002 (we were left hanging for seven whole years!), but unfortunately didn't offer much to get excited about. The long-delayed and anticipated second full-length, \\"Down II: A Bustle In Your Hedgerow,\\" which was slapped together in a mere 28 days time, is widely thought of by metalheads as one of the biggest and most disappointing, awkward, and disjointed sophomore bombs in history.<br /><br />Couple that disc's negative reaction with its equally-as-disappointing sales figures, the fact that they were still taking heat following Pantera's official disbandment in 2003, and that their vocalist was still very much involved in a few other short-lived projects (i.e. Superjoint Ritual), and the gentlemen in Down had no choice but to basically and indefinitely dissolve. But the real sad part is that, for a while, things would only get worse if you were a guy named Phil. Following months of public feuding with him, former longtime Pantera bandmate and friend, guitarist \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott, was senselessly murdered in late 2004. And then, he could only watch as Hurricane Katrina (among the most tragic storms ever to hit the U.S.A.) struck and devastated his hometown the next year.<br /><br />On top of all that, when you add even more turmoil from a recent record label jump (from Elektra to Warner/Roadrunner), and Phil's sworn newfound sobriety, and the end result is one huge, convoluted mess. So who would have expected now would be a good time for another Down record? Well, actually it's the perfect time! True, many fans probably still have a bad taste in their mouths left from \\"A Bustle In Your Hedgerow\\", but 2007's \\"Over The Under\\" is ample proof that these guys can still make great music. In fact, in order to do so, they apparently just needed some fuel for their fire; and as a result, they have never sounded better or more inspired and full of life. Mr. Anselmo delivers a passionate and noteworthy performance complete with catchy, lung-stretching classic metal vocals (which land somewhere between James Hetfield, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne, his old self, and Deep Purple-era David Coverdale), and intelligent, heartfelt lyrics. (And yes, the rumormongers were correct in thinking \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell and Katrina were on his mind when writing lyrics -- for proof, see \\"I Scream\\", and \\"Mourn\\", and \\"On March the Saints\\" and \\"Beneath the Tides\\", respectively.)<br /><br />Everybody else sounds revitalized, too. Brown and Bower combine to form an excellent and very tight bottom-end; the former with good, meaty bass lines, and the latter with his rock-solid (yet too often unsung) drumming. But as is the case with any great sludge/doom opus, the real magic lies in the almighty guitar riffs. And by busting out one monstrous and eminently memorable riff after another with nimble genius, Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein turn in a performance worthy of David Copperfield. No, they might not exactly reinvent the kind of riff that is usually heard in doom metal, but there should be absolutely no debate that the ones heard on \\"Over The Under\\" are positively killer. (And they are easily among the finest this reviewer has heard in quite some time.) Sometimes the riffs are slow and plodding, sometimes mid-tempo, and sometimes downright blistering -- but they are always extremely dangerous, meaty, chunky, heavy, aggressive (but also sufficiently diverse and well-textured), headbangable, trance-inducing, and guaranteed to bounce around your head for a nice, long while, and become legendary at some point in the not-so-distant future. And, to reference the Jimmy Paige quote mentioned above, there isn't one riff on tap here that does not \\"instinctively\\" satisfy.<br /><br />Granted, due to its uncomfortable, drawn-out song lengths (these twelve tracks make for a solid hour of playing time, and several of them are easily among the longest in the group's discography), and the surprising (and almost startling) level of harmony/melody in Phil's vocals, some listeners are bound to initially feel a bit uncertain about the new album. But those who are wise enough to spend more, quality time with it (giving it at least more than one listen) will soon learn that, overall, this is the same old Down we've always known and love. The only difference this time around is just that they opted for a different (and more mature) songwriting approach. As a result, the songs have all the ingredients that made past efforts so great while simultaneously being more intricate and epic. And they may take a little longer to digest than what longtime fans are used to hearing from this New Orleans-based quintet; but your patience will pay off because, ultimately, they will also stick to your ribs longer.<br /><br />With that in mind, it is not all that unfitting for \\"Three Sons and One Star\\" to be the set opener because it confidently piledrives out of the speakers with a commanding bellow from the frontman of \\"The old dog has learned a new trick!\\" From there, the listener is launched into a ton of big, fat, mighty-heavy, chugging guitar and bass riffs, while the vocals echo and cascade on top. \\"Path,\\" with its really strong, Southern blues vibe (a la classic Corrosion of Conformity), excellent, crunching, dueling guitar licks, distorted, sludgy groove, forceful, banging drums, fairly ripping solo, catchy vocal refrain (which may get tattooed to your brain after only one listen), and cool, backing guitar harmonies, is a suitably strong follow-up. Following that comes \\"N.O.D.\\", a distinctly Seventies rock-esque and Thin Lizzy-influenced number backed by a lurching, made-for-headbanging groove, strategic tempo changes, wicked, shrieking vocals, and a bullying barrage of deft, buzzsaw picking.<br /><br />\\"I Scream\\" comes off as a cross between Eyehategod, Van Halen, Judas Priest, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Black Label Society, and vintage Pantera. Naturally, there is plenty of more killer riff work to go around here; but for the most part, \\"I Scream\\" is Philip Anselmo's show -- he expertly mixes a high, almost Rob Halford-worthy falsetto with supple, warm, burned-out crooning and accomplished proper singing to excellent effect. \\"On March The Saints,\\" which was released as \\"OTU\\"'s first single, finds the members of Down working together and as a team -- they move through it in near-perfect lock-step unison. Until around the mid-point, that is, because then the track tosses in an awesomely nasty breakdown, and the rest of it is a straightforward mosher with propulsive, chainsaw guitars and a hooky, circle-pit-ready chant-along vocal refrain. \\"Never Try\\" is a restrained, depressing, mournful, slow-burning brooder -- it could almost be said to be a power ballad with thought-provoking lyrics, and gobs of tasty, bluesy leads, and wailing melodic soloing that give the tune an epic feel.<br /><br />But fear not, because immediately that track is over, the metal returns in full-force. \\"Mourn\\" is an incredibly fierce, dense, and bruising tune/riff-fest that overflows with great, tight, beefy rhythms, and thundering, uber-juicy, bottom-heavy riffs that weigh a friggin' ton and a half, and recall the halcyon days of Crowbar and Soilent Green. Moving along, \\"Beneath the Tides\\" packs quite a lot of stuff, ideas, and breadth into just about three-minutes of time. It is highlighted by an excellent bass intro, huge, darkly pounding power chords, a heavy, rollicking, and propulsive main groove, and steady, pronounced, flowing bass grooves. And as an afterthought, a fine bit of nice guitar harmonies are added to the arrangements, as well. Track nine, \\"His Majesty the Desert,\\" is a surprisingly melodic interlude which boasts an abundance of moody atmosphere and pretty progressive parts that would not sound completely mismatched coming off of an Isis outing.<br /><br />But after that, and like always, Down thunder back even meaner and heavier than before.  \\"Pillamyd\\" is a huge standout track, and also quite possibly the album's biggest highpoint. Why, you ask? Because it begins with a catchy, machine-gun drum beat, and soon thereafter transforms into a bludgeoning, rip-roaring, head-ripping riff-monster. Indeed, this truly astounding collection of inventive, scorching, expansive, and brutally heavy riffage is living proof that Keenan and Windstein are nearly untouchable in the world of modern guitarists. Also included in \\"Pillamyd\\" is deft, booming drumming (including plenty of double bass work), cool, spoken-word parts, and really catchy, sing-along-choruses. In sum, at the beginning of the song, when Phil wails (in that distinctly Phil-esque voice that only he can do so gloriously) \\"Awww, yeah!\\", the listener can't help but whole-heartedly agree.<br /><br />Moving along, at around six-and-a-half minutes in length, \\"In the Thrall of It All\\" is an undeniable epic that evokes vintage Led Zeppelin and \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\"-era Black Sabbath. It is filled with strong guitar lines, and catchy, air-guitar-worthy \\"wah-wah\\" licks. Three excellent and technically-impressive solos come ripping through the mix here, also. Finally, \\"Nothing in Return (Walk Away)\\" rounds out the set, and does so on an strange, contemplative, and low-key (but no less strong or memorable) note. It is a very psychedelic, bluesy, and mournful piece that pushes the nine-minute mark, and is fueled by Seventies prog-style ambience complete with creative uses of ethereal, ringing Mellotron flourishes, and soft, echoing-out croons. Sure, ample chunky, Sabbath-y riffs crop up here and there, but most of \\"Nothing in Return\\" sounds not unlike Pink Floyd, \\"Houses of the Holy\\"-era Zepp., Pantera's 1996 cover of \\"Planet Caravan\\", Tool, Pelican, and (believe it or not!) some late Beatles stuff.<br /><br />Whether Down will ever surpass the level of excellence they first achieved so many years ago is still up in the air; and whether they can even match that excellence (especially without first having to go through so much tragedy) is also completely up for debate. But that is neither here nor there. The fact of the matter is that this is an excellent, arresting, meaningful, meticulous, well-rounded affair, and a very fulfilling and highly contagious listen. It also takes the prize for the best comeback of 2007, and it may darn well be the finest slab of doom and \\"true blue\\" metal released in recent memory.

B000HIVOI2|3.0|This is one of my favorite movies. When it first came out in theaters, I saw it multiple times, and I've owned it on VHS, laserdisc, multiple DVD versions, and now this Blu-ray edition. I was excited to see this movie get the Blu-ray treatment, too, until I watched it. While the menus are nice and very well done (other than the same 7 measures of music repeating every 20 seconds), it's quickly obvious the studio just slapped this release together without giving much thought to it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that it wasn't a very good remastering. The cover says, \\"1080p / Beyond High Definition\\", but the movie is anything but that. While it is slightly better than the various DVD releases I have, the picture isn't as good as on the laserdisc version. The film was not cleaned up much (if at all), and often had a very grainy look to it, though the blacks (often a problem on DVD releases) were better, with much less anti-aliasing and pixelation going on.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this release, though, is the lack of any special features other than an audio commentary track and Spanish subtitles. Since they obviously didn't use up all the space for the movie, they should have at least included the special features found on the DVD releases. This kind of movie begs to have \\"how we did this\\" special features, and it would have been easy to include them as they were already released on the various DVDs.<br /><br />The movie is a 4 1/2  to 5 star film, but this release just doesn't do it justice. I suggest waiting for a Blu-ray release which has a little more effort put into it.

Either way, his depictions of the people and activities in Pyongyang are classic and often telling.  He is critical and relevant in his portrayal, while at the same time presenting a laugh-out-loud experience in a place that few will ever have the chance to visit.  I cannot recommend this book enough to those who want a fun and often educating book to enjoy, whether or not they have any interested in North Korea.  Delisle's ability to observe is classic and can be appreciated by all.

B001RU2YUQ|2.0|I had good expectations from this movie considering the cast included two big names and subject is quite a likable country. Unfortunately the result was less than expected. Actors delivered mediocre performance, story was very thin at best but worst of all was the direction of the movie. The director's clear intention to make an OZ version of \\"Gone with the wind\\" ended up being a bad publicity for people who were involved in the movie. For its credit some shots and special effects were quite good but wasn't enough to help the end result. This could have been a movie to brand a country (not sure how much Australia needs branding). As much as I dislike big budget Hollywood productions, after seen this non-Hollywood big shot movie, I felt for the first time they (Hollywood)seem to be doing better job in these types of projects.  Sort of the story, this movie is really not worth spending close to three hours in front on the screen.
0525478183|4.0|This book is about two different types of relationships. At first, it seems to be about a guy (Quentin, known as Q) who has been in love with his not-so-typical girl next door (Margo) since they were children together. Since being children, they've drifted apart and hang with very different crowds in high school. She's with the cool kids, and he's with the band geeks. But what happens when she decides she needs his help to carry out the ultimate revenge plan? And then disappears?    But there's also the relationship between Q and his two best friends. And I think that's what this book is really about. The interactions among Q and his friends as they try to figure out what happened to Margo and plan for prom at the same time had me laughing out loud even in this seemingly somber book.    I did have one problem with this book: Margo is almost the exact same character as Alaska from another of Green's books. The incandescent girl who plans elaborate pranks and captures the imagination of her peers is an excellent character, but surely Green has more than one leading lady in his repertoire. Incidentally, I like Margo better than her counterpart.

First and foremost - his vacabulary, his parlance, his prose poetry. Bacause of these, you loose the sense of reading the novel, and you feel like you are reading the poetry...<br /><br />\\"I can promise you that the world is a factory. The sun stirs it, the humans rule it. And I remain. I carry them away. \\"<br /><br />\\"The girl loved that-- the shivering snow\\"<br /><br />\\"She was the book thief without the words. Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like the rain. \\"<br /><br />\\"Despite the forced labor of breath, she fed the words through the gap in the doorway--between the mayor and the frame - to the woman. Such was her effort to breathe that the words escaped only a few at a time.\\"<br /><br />One of my friends told me, when recommended the book couple of weeks ago: \\"I did not know how one could live through the words as it is in the book\\" ...<br /><br />But there is also something else. The book has deep meaning and strong message. It is about the most dark period of human history - Nazi Germany. It's about Jewish persecution and Holocaust. But it is also about forgivness, about love, about the simple fact that not all Germans were Nazi and not all Nazis were killers. It's about life in hard times, and about difficult greatness.

0375701427|5.0|This novel is the story of third-generation Jewish-American Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov.  A legendary Newark high school athlete and local hero, Swede serves in a non-combat military role at the end of WWII and eventually inherits control of his family's Newark glove manufacturing business.   Some family strife results from his choices of marrying Dawn, an Irish-American, Catholic former Miss New Jersey, and moving into an old Jersey country farmhouse far outside Newark, but his life mostly resembles a postwar, suburban fable of peace and success.   Swede and Dawn have a daughter Merry, who transforms from a delightful child into an angry teenager consumed with violent leftist fanaticism.  Frequent Roth narrator Nathan Zuckerman was a childhood acquaintance of the Levov family (the Swede was his boyhood idol).  Decades later, after meeting with Swede and later his brother Jerry, Zuckerman explores the Swede's story, and most of the book is Zuckerman's account of the Swede's disintegrating life between 1967 to 1973.     Some readers have interpreted the dissolution of Swede's tranquility as allegorical of the United States' political and social struggles through the turbulent late 1960s and early 1970s.  Racial discord, Vietnam, the Weathermen and Watergate all feature prominently in the novel (though critics have noted some historical inaccuracies in Roth's narrative).  Swede's father bemoans the transformation of Newark into a blighted, crime-ridden failure, and urges his son to move the glove factory elsewhere.   Roth's portrayal of Merry as a capricious, spoiled idealist seems to show his distaste for the New Left.    While the plot fades toward the somewhat unsatisfying end, with a partially unfulfilling ending, this novel offers strong, memorable characters powered by vivid human emotion.  Some have suggested this book's 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction stems more from cumulative acclaim for Roth's four decades of output than this individual novel, but it still meritsa five-star Amazon review.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter is, hands down, the most brilliantly written television series I have ever watched. The pacing is downright perfection, the story telling and weaving is an absolute powerhouse of entertainment. Plus, the dialogue is nothing short of utterly amazing.<br /><br />The cast is something that award shows lust for.  Michael C. Hall was always brilliant on [[ASIN:B000HEVZBW Six Feet Under - The Complete Series Gift Set]].  Since episode one he has proven that he can make a totally different character (than the interally conflicted gay brother who owns a funeral home w/his family.)  He truly is an actor in the caliber of DeNiro or Nicholson, in my opinion.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is amazing too.  Jennifer Carpenter [[ASIN:B001MVYUQQ Quarantine (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray]]] is often called the weak link (by my wife and almost every woman I know for some reason,) however I disagree, she's just as brilliant in her internal conflicts than everyone else.  She's often the conscience in Dexter's mind when there is none otherwise.  That's not to say Dexter doesn't have morals, but there are certain things that his sister points out which seems like a light bulb goes off in the Dexter's head.<br /><br />Jimmy Smits in any TV show seems to improve it by a factor of three.  This series didn't need it so much, but he's a very welcome addition.  In fact, I compared the 'Donut Shop Scene' in this season to the DeNiro/Pacino coffee shop scene in [[ASIN:B0006J28KU Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].<br /><br />This season is full of twists and turns which come like an 18 wheeler truck from out of nowhere.  They blindside you like any great mystery and story does. Constantly brilliant is an understatement when it comes to Dexter and his way of thinking and the problems he faces.<br /><br />From episode one, the story arc is a white-knuckle thrill ride which grabs you from the get-go.<br /><br />The only issue which could be seen as a fault to anyone who hasn't seen the last two seasons, is that you MUST watch the first 24 episodes.  Without knowing the history of Dexter, you are completely lost.  This is certainly not a series you can jump into just because it 'looks okay.'<br /><br />Five stars for sure, wonderful in every way..

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a fantastic movie, although one that I won't let my small kids watch.
0061367036|5.0|Lots of fun for fans and those of us who like ghost stories. I ripped through this in a weekend. I would recommend reading this before reading Irvine's other book, John Winchester's Journal. The guide book breaks everything down and catagorizes it whereas the journal is haphazard with this sort of \\"info\\". Good stuff.
B001608QVS|5.0|This blu ray boxset is a excellent deal when you buy it used.<br />In fact most blu ray dvds are overpriced brand new but they are incredible dvds which is why they are worth collecting. And this set gives you the great dirty harry series in a remastered and cleaned up prints.  The original standard dvds looked really bad and this set in either form (remastered standard or blu ray)  is a huge improvement.<br />Many  standard warner brothers standard dvds that were not remastered looked awful but they have done a excellent job on every blu ray they have put out. And this set looks great. I have read where other reviewers said that the grain on the first two is really bad, actually it's not at all , I have always thought that using a grainy affect to film with is not a good idea really. It's supposed to be artistic but it's just grainy.<br />That being said many movies this old have a slightly grainy look.  In other words these movies are not too grainy at all and this shouldn't be a distraction. If you want distraction just buy a warner bros non remastered standard dvd; many of them have lines in them and faded out color.  Blu ray is leading the way into clean prints and taht's a good thing.  If you like the dirty harry series or good detective movies then these are part of a classic series of that genre. Clint Eastwood is at the top of his game and he created a cultural icon for a our violent society. But his detective is not a antihero; He's a heroic and realist detective who uses his guns because he has to.  This set is fantastic and highgrade and worth owning.
0061706620|4.0|Not a bad read for fans of the show. It includes the storys from the two prequel comic books, things that were in the show, and much of the \\"info\\" and illustrations in Irvine's other Supernatural book, The Supernatural Book of Monsters, Spirits, Demons, and Ghouls. I read the other book before I read this so I was able to skip (and wanted to) the \\"notes\\" written by John Winchester. Lots of fun and I highly recommend it for the fans. Grab the other book too for the lowdown on the beasties and things that go bump in the night.
B00005JNX0|5.0|Fun for kids young and old and might even help to burn a few calories. King Julien is an interesting \\"little monkey\\" and of course, Alex, Gloria, Melman Marty all make this a movie worth owning. I highly recommend this movie even in this economy. It's a treasure!

B001TH16DI|5.0|I wouldn't pay much attention to all these negative reviews. I can live with the original theater release on the first movie. All the movies are remastered and will look fantastic, just like the HD DVDs only a lot cheaper. The other director cuts for the other movies made little difference. Star Trek 2 needed a lot of work and the finished product is spectacular. I for one will be happy to get mine when released.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This music cd is the perfect present for those who have lost their hope for finding the true love! Above all the music creates the scene of another time and puts the listener to that period. I recommend to see the movie and then listen to the cd.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|After guitar players heard Eddie on this album, they copied the finger tap.  That in itsself tells the story about this release.  VH started it all for west coast metal and their first album is the bomb.  Now check out VH 2, Fair Warning and Women and Children First.  These three are not anywhere as heavy or as raw, but each are 4 star release's.  No other group in the history of music can say that their first 4 or even 5 (1984) were are dominate in the scene as VH can.  Each of their first 5 release's shine.
0321525655|5.0|I bought and read this book a few months ago, when I was working on a presentation I was planning to give to my teammates. My initial presentation was typical - 7 bullets per page, lots of text, and sparse pictures. Since the time allotted to me was around 30 minutes, I created around 15 - 20 slides.    After reading the book (pretty much cover to cover), my presentation transformed into 70 slides, with around 1 or 2 lines per slide, and a picture almost every 2 slides or less. I comfortably gave the presentation within 30 minutes and got really good reviews from the team.    The Point: This book is not about how to do better with PowerPoint (or Keynote). It's about thinking differently about how to present. If you are thinking simply about how to handle PowerPoint/Keynote better or to learn some cool tricks, this is NOT the book for you.    However, after reading the book (and by keeping an open mind), you can see yourself thinking differently whenever you start working on a PowerPoint (mostly at the end, when you start reviewing your deck) and cringing whenever you see a slide with lots and lots of text.    This is an interesting way to think about presenting. You are going to face a lot of resistance within your team to this new way, but I believe it's worth it. True, you won't be able to apply it to your status report deck, but it will help you present better.

0740748475|5.0|Having born in India and brought up on European classics like Tintin and Asterix, with their subtle yet powerful humor, I was vastly disappointed by the huge dose of Marvel XYZ-Men in the American comics area.    I was very pleasantly surprised however, when I started reading the newspaper comics, starting with Calvin and Hobbes.     What America lost in its main stream 'graphic novel' category, it has more than compensated with its unique 'newspaper comic strip' counterpart, and Calvin and Hobbes is probably the best in that category.    The inane antics of Calvin and the subtle 'daddy-isms' by Calvin's dad has many a times lifted my spirits and left me rolling on the floor laughing!     This is an excellent set that one should have in their shelf. You will find yourself quoting and re-reading this book till you die and then for all your future generations!

B00005JPY2|4.0|Premise<br />*It is an alternate 1985.  Richard Nixon remains president for several consecutive terms; America won the Vietnam war; the tensions between America and the USSR almost causes a full outbreak of thermonuclear war.  In the midst of all this, a group of masked heroes (who have been disbanded previously) investigates the murder of one of their own men.  One thing leads to another, building up to a climax that could bring about the end of humanity.<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video/sound quality was excellent in the theater, and should prove to be awesome when they put this on disc.<br />*The film has a fair amount of action and lots of interesting special effects, yet none of them ever really push the film over the edge like other superhero movies.  In fact, this film downplays much of the action to tell the story.<br />*The visual style is impressive.  There are some slow-motion effects, but not as many as I thought there would be.  Aside from the vivid special effects (which provides lots of memorable images), the photography is great.<br />*Production design is good; costumes and props are good, and the sets are great.  Look out for some motifs and some historical references.<br />*The story is very interesting.  It is very different from the usual comic-book films, and presents a lot of themes and ideas to really think about (for example, ideas about the savagery of human nature, and the state of society).<br />*The characters are excellent; a lot of time is spent on developing them, and by the end of the film, you can really understand them.  They are well-acted and well-written.<br />*Music is interesting.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*As noted above, the action is downplayed.  The first hour or so of the movie is spent developing the characters and showing the world that they live in.  Some people may be dissapointed if they were expecting more action, especially for a movie that runs over two and a half hours long.<br />*Not for kids; rated R for quite a few scenes with gnarly bloody violence, some sex scenes, nudity (including full male nudity...with the blue guy nonetheless), brutality, and thematic elements.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The morality of this whole story is pretty messed up.  The \\"heroes\\" do a lot of wicked things, while the \\"villian\\" is righteous.  There is a deeper philosophical meaning to all this, and the story brings up some interesting ideas and questions.  But while much of it is thought-provoking and unique, some people may find it frustrating or just plain weird.<br /><br />In the movie, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) described the miracle of life as a paradox, relating to \\"turning air into gold,\\" and that might as well be the paradigm of this whole movie.  It is a paradox, not only because this film was said to be \\"unfilmable,\\" but because here we have a comic-boook hero movie without any real heroes; instead, the characters are morally ambiguous and live in a world that is close to annihilation.  Yet, despite all of the condemning views of humanity, the movie ends with hope.  These are just some of the thoughts that this movie throws out at you; it is a very thought-provoking story with some insightful characters.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|In the past, I have only bought one Idol cd and that was Bo Bice (which I still listen to) because he was a rare contestant who could sing anything, country, rock, pop, etc and be good. But of course Bice's fame died down like most non winners (I do like Daughtry though).    Now, when David Cook became a contestant, I saw something that I hadnt seen since Bice. Someone with raw talent. Cook did the same thing as Bice and Daughtry. He made every song great. I routed for him from the start and was excited to see him win. He was the only winner in the show's history I would pay to watch and buy his cds. Which I bought his debut album.    He actually has very good songs that are sort of like the ones he sung on idol. He has a classic rock style song, softer tong kind of rock, etc. I enjoyed every song on it. I think David Cook will be on the greats from the show along with Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood and Chris Daughtry and this cd proves it.    Do you know why, because like my title says, he is a different kind of idol. He is a rocker but with a twist. Buy this cd, download it or whatever
B000LF73ZE|4.0|I don't read a variety of books, so I especially found the exploration of Hanna's involvement with the German SS during World War II provacative.  The impetus for committing atrocities during the halocaust is indeed questioned.  An examination and a resulting attempt at seeking a further understanding of \\"man's inhumanity to man\\" is presented in a format and at a level new to me and perhaps to many other readers.    I agree with some other readers' viewpoints as to the apparent shallow nature of the affair between Hanna and Michael.  I do not agree that the author tired of the plot and sought to end it in a careless manner.  I felt that the story ended in the only \\"comfortable\\" way that was possible.  Michael paid a price in the end for jumping to conclusions as to the true appeal of Hanna as a human being.  But giving Michael the opportunity to interface again with Hanna would have led to the substance of another book with even more interesting, conflicting, and probably discouraging interaction.    Is it possible this was a memoir?  I have not heard this nor researched this question as yet.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|should consider viewing this classic movie.  The subject of the movie, George Patton, is a hero to many, but is also unpopular with some, as he was unapologetically pro-American rather than internationalist, and he took political incorrectness to the level of an art form.  Patton remains a controversial figure.<br /><br />George C Scott, in a brilliant performance, brings Patton to life in this inspiring film.  The script, written by Francis Ford Coppola, features the famous beginning scene of Patton giving a speech to his men.  Also highlighted are Patton's penchant for flamboyant uniforms, his strongly religious side, his avid reading of military history, his acts of brazen boldness in the face of adversity (such as standing in the open and shooting at a plane straffing his postion with a handgun), and his ongoing run-ins with the officers above him whom he views as mere politicians.<br /><br />The action sequences are perhaps a bit dated and unconvincing in terms of realism, which is unfortunate as a sense of verisimilitude would have allowed a more vivid contrast between Patton's enthusiasm for battle with the real life horrors of combat.<br /><br />This film is inspirational, especially now.  WWII was a very difficult time for America, and Patton took the challenges on with enthusiasm and verve, his ivory handled revolvers blazing all the way.
B001LF4IA6|2.0|I'm getting a little tired of the violin, synthesizer sound of the past couple of albums.  Remember when rock and roll was about guitars?  This trend started with the intro to Lonesome Day back on The Rising.  It continues here.   A few really good tunes, but the sound disappoints overall.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|OUTSTANDING!  Be sure to watch the DVD before listening to the CD. The video is an outstanding collection of seminal blues artists, most of whom have passed on. Buddy Flett is a standout. Buddy (and the Bluebirds) should be checked out for some great N'awlins blues sound.   Kenny did a wonderful job accompanying the artists without overpowering them. Kenny's dad came up with an excellent idea of this road trip.
B0017HPHBM|5.0|This gift set was packed with total awesome-ness. There was the movie, obviously, then a second disc that had tons of documentaries on the production of the film and tidbits about the different characters, gadgets, etc. There's some neat mini movie posters and a batman jump drive. The movie money is useless only because i bought this after The Dark Knight (even MORE spectacular) was long out of theaters.  Batman Begins is one of those movies that captivates your attention. I was NOT a Batman fan at all prior to these movies. I thought it was extremely lame and only by some coaxing on my brother's part did i even bother to watch it.  Let me tell you that the movie blew my socks off from start to finish.  It's a great movie, and Batman's now my FAVORITE super hero.   Chris Nolan did a great job putting this film together, and has the BEST choice of actors. The supporting actors are great. They've got Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. What more could you ask for??  The movie, itself is spectacular, and the gift set is really cool.

0374530718|1.0|This book is absolute garbage. This text is approachable, but at the expense of insight and substance. If you can choke down the terrible, tacked on plot, you will be left with a trite and cursory look at basic philosophical issues. It reads like it was written by the book's moronic main character.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig stars as the new, re-imagined James Bond in the 2006 (non-spoof) version of Casino Royale.    After Bond foils the plans of the banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who provides funding for the world's terrorists, Le Chiffre sets up a last ditch effort to win his money back in a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale. James Bond enters the game in order to destroy Le Chiffre for good. Bond teams up with Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) who is assigned to keep an eye on him and how he handles the large amount of government money needed to enter the tournament. But as Bond gets more involved in the game, he becomes tangled in a web of lies, deceit, and betrayal.    Casino Royale is partially based on Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. About the first third of the film is added to provide a background for Le Chiffre, but the poker game stays very close to the book. Although the film may not sound as action-packed as some of the others, trust me, the action is intense! This film has a deeper storyline than most Bond movies. Daniel Craig plays a colder James Bond that has a chip on his shoulder. The film definitely takes a darker and more serious tone to match. Casino Royale also lacks the humor of other Bond films (don't expect Sean Connery style one-liners or Roger Moore slapstick here). The film has a noticeable absence of gadgets, which I thought were becoming over-the-top after Die Another Day.    This stylistic re-boot to the Bond franchise is very well done! Daniel Craig is an excellent James Bond in his own unique way. Highly Recommended!
B000LPS4BG|3.0|great story-great actors -wonderful picture but the sound and tone were muffled. At times the dialogue was hard to understand.
B000001FAW|5.0|\\"Saturday Night Fever\\" might have been the biggest, most important album of their career but \\"Children of the World\\" is definitely my all-time favorite album by them or by any other artist.  I first bought it on cassette tape but recently bought it on cd.  There are no fillers on this one.  Every song on it is great.  My favorite has to be \\"Subway\\".  Barry's falsettos are flawless.  The other songs come in a close second.  It always brings back some fond memories.  It's a really fun album to listen to and after all these years, I still listen to it.

We simply could not get into the story or stop laughing anytime BATMAN would talk in that strange digitally altered voice they tried to use.<br /><br />I am an old comics collector and love the whole Superhero universe but I don't see the cause for excitement over this movie. Pretty flat.<br /><br />BUT THE BIGGEST IRRITATION that most likely contributed to us not finishing the movie was the annoying sound and audio levels.<br /><br />We had to watch the movie with the REMOTE in hand because dialoque was almost impossible to hear yet sound effects, music and other audio effects were vibrating and overloading our speakers.<br /><br />The entire time watching the film was like a video game with the thumb RIDING THE VOLUME KNOB up and down and up and down, etc..<br /><br />Horrible.... sound and audio mixing that ruined the potential enjoyment of the film.

0142410314|5.0|The first time I read this book I did not read this book, it was read to me in class in third grade.    Our teacher had broken down the chapters so that they would fit a certain time frame and then would stop making us want to hear more and allso encourage us to read.    So the book unfolded to us with a series of what would be called cliff hangers along the way.  What would happen and when.  Though it is obvous now based on the title that Charlie would find the special candy bar, back then it was not.    I picked up the book again recently and it is still just as charming and fun as I remember.  A definate classic children's book, and for younger children probably less scary than either of the two movies.    High recommended.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Yes, it is safe to take the kids to this one!  The whole family enjoyed it.  We had left the 14 year old at home, but will rent it as soon as it comes out so she can see it too.  The message is positive, the innuendos few, and the theme is just plain fun.  Even the \\"Paris\\" character keeps things mostly covered.  Nice change for a 21st Century film.      The lead, though he starts out trying to manipulate life to go his materialistic ways, learns how to manipulate life to benefit all of those around him.  He is just that kind of guy who never could have been the selfish fool.  So, it really can be a great discussion starter for the family about morality, unselfishness, and proper behavior in community.      On top of all that deep stuff, it is just hilariously funny!  There were even some applause at the end when we watched it in the theater.  It has been a long time since I've been in a movie where the audience was moved to applause.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|I don't claim to know who the \\"World's Greatest Guitar Player\\" is, but surely this guy is \\"among 'em\\".<br /><br />I enjoy listening to albums/CDs of Clapton, Allman Bros, Buddy Guy, Hendrix, SRV, Roy Buchanan, and others too numerous to mention, but the difference to me is Beck's diversity.  On this album he plays hard rock, but he also plays music from the late 70's fusion albums of John McLaughlin and Billy Cobham, similar to his own Blow by Blow/Wired period.  Others take me back to Weather Report.  Goodbye Pork Pie Hat(a straight jazz tune)/Brush With The Blues, reminds me of the Pink Floyd sound on Dark Side and Wish You Were Here.<br /><br />Many guitar players speak of \\"singing\\" in their heads when playing.  Jeff Beck's playing sounds like the great singers.  Tremendous range with delicate precision; soft as Angel(Footsteps)or with the great power of Led Boots.  This album is my new favorite of all time.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|About 45 minutes into this film I realized that this was not about cute dancing penguins and chimney sweeps.  Yowza, was that a surprise or what?!    About that time my wife came downstairs and said, \\"Why the **** are you eating ice cream directly from the container again?\\"    So I called her over and said, \\"Hey, come here.  Do you see any dancing penguins in this?\\"      She then told me that I was an idiot and that the movie I was expecting was \\"Mary Poppins.\\"      So then where's Bruce Willis?      This was totally not what I expected.
B001MYIXAW|1.0|This was the worst vampire movie I have ever seen and perhaps one of worst movies I have seen period.  The movie was slow, there was no action.  The story didn't go anywhere.  I can't understand what people were watching.  Save your money and do not buy this one.  You will thank me later
B00005K3O4|5.0|My oldest son's literature teacher told him that Shakespeare was the height of the written art form.  Well, I marched right into his office holding a copy of Killer Klowns and said, \\"Oh yeah?!  Well, try this Bernie!\\"  (The funny thing about this is that I learned that his name is not Bernie.)    Anyways, I challenged this so-called \\"teacher\\" to watch this film and if he couldn't see how this rated as great literature, I would buy him a new car and not one of those sissy priuses.    This film has everything great in classic literature.  Human trajedy, soul-searching, existential questions about good versus evil, popcorn that turns into very toothy carnivores when put into a clothes hamper, random violence directed at bicycles, and pies ... lots and lots of pies.    If more people watched this film, we would come together as a global community and really understand who the threat is.  Please, let us act upon this before it is too late.    Oh, and my wife and I disagree whether this should be categorized as a documentary or not.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I don't know about you, but the soundtracks to movies/shows seem to sparkle a little brighter if I've actually seen the show!  This is definitely the case in the Mama Mia movie soundtrack...  Sure Peirce Brosnan can't carry a tune and occasionally Meryl Streep's voice wavers during a song, but if you've already seen the movie these \\"imperfections\\" add charm and feeling to the already-loved Abba songs on this soundtrack.  It is an upbeat and fun addition to your music collection.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|We haven't had broadcast TV in our house for over 2 years although we do watch DVD's.  I must say I don't miss the commercials and really don't miss the weekly shows either.      I wasn't aware of the existence of this miniseries until I saw it in passing at Sam's Club.  I bought it on a whim because I am interested in American history and thought it looked interesting.  Wow! I haven't seen a piece this good for years!  The acting is superb across the board and the story reveals much more of our country's early history than you will learn in a high school or college class.  I found the portrayal of our forefathers to be quite interesting and (as far as I recall) pretty accurate.  I thought the series did an excellent job portraying the intricate relationships among the various characters and the parts they played in the early development of our democracy.  I developed a new understanding of John Adams and a real admiration of Abigale Adams.  Laura Linney was outstanding in this role!    My husband (who usually prefers action/adventure flicks such as \\"Die Hard\\") also loved the series.  My 11 yr old daughter also watched and enjoyed most of it. We have lent the discs to friends and family who have all enjoyed them and are looking to by their own.    Bottom line....It is worth buying a copy for yourself.  It is not only an interesting review of our country's early history and the people who were part of it, but a wonderful love story that each and every one of us can learn from.  I can't recommend this enough.
141690977X|2.0|I think this book actually has some practical advice, but it really should have been called \\"You deserve better\\" not \\"he's just not that into you\\".  Seriously.  I feel like its a put-down to the woman.  It's like saying \\"he doesn't think your good enough for him, but someone will think you're good enough eventually... go find that a-hole\\".  I feel like the book talks down to women like their stupid.  Maybe the dude really isn't into her... but I think whats more important for women to consider in their relationship is not whether or not the man is \\"that into them\\" but whether or not they're being treated according to how they want and deserve... and if they're picking up this book, they're probably not... and THAT's the important thing.    A girl shouldn't be sitting around wondering \\"hmmm does he really want me?\\" a girl should be thinking \\"Am I getting what I want out of this relationship.\\"    Does anyone actually remember the conclusion of that SATC episode?  Miranda's out with a guy who says he wants to go home instead of hang out with her more... and she says \\"Admit it, you're not that into me.  It's ok!\\"  And it turns out the guy just had really bad diarrhea from the Indian food they ate.  Books like this are bad because they overgeneralize.  There's lots of reasons men do the things they do and many of them probably have nothing to do with you.      This book is freaking stupid.  I picked it up out of sheer curiosity and it is 20 minutes wasted... the time would have been better spent staring at a blank wall.
1582701709|1.0|This is pathetic rubish.  Positive thinking is great and there are a lot of wonderful books and tapes with affirmations.  but this book basically says if you wish for something with every fiber of your body it will magically become yours.  Simply not so.  That is not the law of attraction.  The law of attraction is if you are expecting good and are happy, you will bring about good in your life through WORKING toward your GOALS. If you want to buy a book about changing your life through positive thoughts keep looking.  The only real secret to this book is that the author and her sister want to get rich.
B000002GQE|5.0|If anyone reading this has read any of my other reviews (I only review my favorite cds out of the 3,500 that my wife and I own), then I will tell you that this probably should have been the first cd that I ever reviewed.  I grew up listening to the music my brother listened to and by default, those groups became some of my favorites.  I was born in 1968, so in the 70s, when I was little, I just knew what I liked by hearing good songs.  Some of my favorites were the Beatles, Steve Miller, Kansas and Alan Parsons.  As I got older and started to play trumpet, I got into bands like Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears.  But when I was 13 (1981), things changed immediately - I didn't dislike the previously mentioned bands, but I heard something that completely changed the way I listened to music.  I heard The Moody Blues - Long Distance Voyager to be exact.  That album got me addicted to their music, so that I wanted to buy everything that they ever put out - I eventually became a collector.  My brother did have Days of Future Passed on a tape, so when I first listened to it, after hearing Long Distance Voyager, I realized then that they were my new favorite band.  Their songwriting, Justin Hayward's voice, their orchestrations, and the mellotron were all of the things that had me hooked.  For those of you who don't know, Days of Future Passed ties all of the songs together using an assembled orchestra, playing themes and variations of the rest of the album.  I won't write the story of the album here because anyone can look it up on their website or find it on any of a number of other websites, but it was revolutionary for it's time and more progressive than any other music of the 60s, with the exception of the Beatles.  If anyone doesn't have this in their collection, they are missing a part of history.  It really is an historically important recording and this is the reason that I'm disgusted with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  They have ignored the Moodies for far too long.  If you don't have it, get it, dim the lights, sit back with a glass of wine and put this on from start to finish, and you'll know what I mean.  Enjoy!
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Shades of the American western (and a little taste of \\"Quigley Down Under\\"). Set in the immediate pre-WWII Australia, parts of the story seem a bit over the top, but the story was good and the acting ok. My wife and I agree that \\"Australia\\" is a keeper.
B0002PZVHK|5.0|If you are in the market for music, don't get this.  This is not music.  This is a collection of finely tuned soundscapes.  Each track will put you in a particular place.  It may be peaceful, a little off center, maybe even a bit disturbing.  Your ear may yearn for resolution, but none may come.  I don't have much music in my collection like this.  I think it's good to have though, for those moods when you don't want a lot of structure and instead would like to float through sound.  It's engaging and overall yields a good experience.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|Great movie!  Kind of slow if you are looking for something for a special date or a night with the guys, but it's a great story, well-made film, and has fabulous actors!
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Music For Airports is my introduction to Brian Eno.  I heard it was a good place to start.  First and foremost I'd like to say if you are looking for beats or a traditional melody, you won't find it here.  But you aren't likely looking for that if you are here searching for Brian Eno's ambient work.    On this disc, There is no complexity to speak of, and it has an almost soporific feel to it.  That may be just what you are looking for.  If you want beauty and simplicity, peace and calm, and a soft effortless way about it's expression, you have found something worth adding to your collection here.  It's really quite nice.  Never jarring.  It strikes me as something that could assist you in falling asleep, but has more applications than just that.  As for me personally, I like to listen to ambient music with headphones in bed right before I fall asleep.  I was able to get several other Brian Eno albums that I have not explored yet, but if this album is any indication of what I will uncover on the others, I will be most pleased.  I hope you are pleased as well.
1400032717|5.0|Why did I say that it was a refreshing change of pace? This novel is unique in the way it was written, it is just simply refreshing. This novel moves along a fast pace and is quirky especially with all the explanations of math, which I have never been keen on. The story is just more than that and is very insightful to this character named Christopher and the state of his mind. I am not familiar with autism even though I do know of kids who have Aspberger's, but nothing like this.    This book focuses on Christopher and his desire to complete Level A math courses so he can get into university. He stumbles on the next door neighbor's dog who was impaled on a garden fork and the story takes off there. It shows his confusion as the subleties (which the reader can pick up right off the bat) of human emotions and the double layer of communication that passes for conversations among adults. He was told that his mother had died, then in the search for the murderer of the dog, he stumbles across revelations about his parents, life and people in general.     I thought the author did a great job of giving an insight of a character's state of mind, how he uses mathametical problems to solve an issue at hand and how he managed to step out of his comfort zone to find his way to London on a train. I just found this a neat book full of quirky details that shows the imagination of the author on hand. It is well-written in a crisp, clean style. It moves the story along in a quick pace and still is interesting enough to keep the story moving ...     I have to say that this is a different and unique novel ... way different than other novels on the market lately. That deserves a five star in my collection.
B0018AVNKC|5.0|I am a big fan of stop-motion animation.  That is how this movie was made.  If you liked \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\", or any other movie of this style, you would probably really like Coraline.  It's amazing how intriguing all of the environments and characters are.  Very well designed, and always a treat for the eyes.  If you can see it in 3-D, go for it.  I had to pay 3 dollars extra for the 3-D glasses, but it was worth it.  It seems that those old fashioned one red and one blue lens style 3-D glasses are a thing of the past.  They handed out glasses with clear lenses at my local theater.  They did not cause any discomfort, and they worked well.  They added more depth to the already visually deep movie.  Coraline is really fun to watch, but may not be appropriate for very young children.  There are more than a few creepy parts.  But that is part of the Coraline entertainment package and you will probably be very entertained.  It took somewhere in the neighborhood of 4 years to make this movie.  The crew must have been really dedicated.  See the fruits of their labor... see Coraline!
015206396X|2.0|Feel free to ignore my opinion as I didn't make it past page eleven before returning this book to the library.  I picked it up because a friend recommended it and the idea sounded interesting.  However, I have a thing for believability even in my fantasy novels.<br /><br />First, the fight scenes aren't very realistic.  (One of the very first fight moves the heroine does don't sound possible to do as described...at least, not without getting a leg cut off.)<br /><br />Second, some of the wording is odd.  For example, the heroine whistles low, like an owl.  Um, owls hoot, not whistle.<br /><br />Third, some of the actions are strange but go unexplained.  For example, the heroine takes out the prison guards (who I would presume have keys to the cell), yet her partner picks the lock to the cell without even checking for keys.  No reason is given as to why they don't look for keys.<br /><br />Also, the heroine places a pill in the mouth of each man she's knocked unconscious.  What the pill does and how it works is not explained, so I'm assuming it's acts like a normal pill--as in, it needs to be swallowed (which, to our knowledge, it isn't) and digested for a bit before it's effective.  I think, though, that the author is implying that the pill will keep the guards unconscious for fifteen minutes.  Yet this doesn't make sense with how a real pill works.  I need more explanation or I'm going to assume the story isn't very realistic in the 'real world' aspects and I'll lose interest.<br /><br />I'm writing this review so that others who are as nit-picky as me can avoid the book or at least know what they're getting into.

031606792X|1.0|Many people have written reviews on this book.  Many are eloquent, and I don't hope to match them.  But this book affected me so deeply I had to write what I felt.  Hopefully then I'll be able to let it go.    While I knew things would not turn out well for Jacob and Bella in this book, I did not expect the creep factor of BREAKING DAWN.      ***Warning.  A few spoilers are revealed in this review***    Let's go back.    TWILIGHT:  Edward was a cool vampire.  I liked him.      NEW MOON: Edward lied to Bella and abandoned her.  Jacob picked up the pieces and helped make her whole again.     ECLIPSE:  The love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob intensified.  Or, maybe I should say they intensified between Bella and Jacob.  In my opinion, Edward was very quiet and remote (and manipulative) in this book.  On the other hand, I clearly saw how much Jacob loved Bella.  He was passionate, and maybe pushy on occasion, but that was because he was agonizingly in love with her, and desperate for her to face what was going on between them.  She did, at the end of Eclipse.  She finally admitted she was in love with Jacob.  He was her soul mate and she even envisioned a future and children with him.     And yet...she loved Edward more.  Apparently, her love for Edward eclipsed that of a \\"soul mate.\\"  Why???  I just could not figure it out.  To me, Edward was a shadowy figure in New Moon and Eclipse.  Who WAS he?  ...Besides a man who wanted to protect and control her, of course.  Clearly, Bella was physically attracted to him, but I couldn't understand the emotional bond.  Her \\"love\\" for him seemed like blind infatuation to me.  And focusing back on Edward again--I couldn't feel his deep love or angst for Bella, either. Obviously he felt the physical attraction too, and he wanted to protect her, but to me their relationship went no deeper.    Jacob, in all his flaws, felt REAL.  He LOVED her, and would do anything for her.  His howls of pain as she repeatedly chose Edward over him ripped my heart out.  I thought she was a fool to choose a cool, emotionally distant man over Jacob.    BREAKING DAWN:  Then came Breaking Dawn.  I knew things were truly doomed for Jacob and Bella when Edward and Bella rushed forward with their wedding.  Then that bizarre honeymoon and the baby...  I agree with other reviewers--after Bella became a vampire, she didn't seem like the same Bella anymore.  She was too perfect.    But that was nothing, compared to the most horrible part of Breaking Dawn:  Imprinting.  It was a weak plot contrivance from the beginning, and I knew the instant I saw it that I would not like how things would turn out for Jacob.  In Eclipse, I hoped Jacob was lying and that he'd actually imprinted on Bella.  But Jacob didn't lie (except for one obvious one, when he duped her into kissing him in Eclipse).  Lies were left to Edward--another reason why I could not cozy up to Edward's character.  (In fact, Edward freely admitted he was a fantastic liar.)    In Breaking Dawn, I cringed, wondering which female Jacob would lose his strong free will to and bow down and worship.  Leah crossed my mind, and it made me shudder.  I couldn't imagine anyone worse.  I actually found myself hoping he'd \\"imprint\\" on one of the girls he saw when he went cruising around, searching for oblivion from his pain over Bella.  Imprinting on one of those girls would have been bad, but acceptable.  But when he imprinted on Bella's BABY, I about came unglued.  The ick factor aside, the whole idea made my skin crawl.  I wanted to vomit.  WHAT????      Suddenly, Bella \\"knew\\" why she'd been drawn to Jacob all along--because he'd imprint on her child. (Completely unbelievable--SHE had feelings for HIM before Reneesme was even a possibility.)  Now, suddenly after R's birth, Bella didn't have \\"those kinds\\" of feelings for Jacob anymore.  Even worse, he wasn't in love with her anymore, either.  Apparently, the only way to solve the angst of Bella & Jacob's relationship was to give Jacob a lobotomy so he'd not only accept, but grovel at the feet of an infant that looked like Bella.  Aghghh!  I mean REALLY!!!  Just castrate the poor guy.    In sum, Breaking Dawn sickened and infuriated me.  Stephenie Meyer did not resolve the angst between Bella and Jacob.  Bella never had to work through her deep, lingering feelings for Jacob.  She was given a \\"reason\\" for why she'd strung him along for months.  It was a neat salve for her guilt.  Poor Jacob deserved better.  He LOVED her.  It made me crazy that he was brainwashed into settling for scraps--a child that looked like Bella.    For an alpha male, Jacob was treated like a dog.    Boo, Stephenie Meyer!
B00004XMTJ|2.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber has an incredible gift for melody. Sadly he has never learned how to use songs effectively in the narrative structure of a musical.<br /><br />That's less of a problem with CATS because there really is no structure. In fact there is no story, just a collection of portraits of various cats. In the theatre the costumes, scenery and special effects packed enough entertainment value that audiences didn't seem to mind that there was no story.<br /><br />For me the fun of the show is in the first half hour with some fun songs and great dancing. But it soon slides into total tedium that not even the big number \\"Memory\\" can relieve. In the final moments we you are told that \\"A cat is not a dog\\" you will wonder why you spent all this time to learn that.<br /><br />The TV version of the musical was shot with multiple cameras and gets a bit busy at times. There are moments when you wish the camera would just stay on one angle and focus on the action. The sound quality is excellent, and you get most of the show. But really it's dull to watch on TV. Truth be told it's dull in the theatre too but live performance helps smooth over much of the tedium.

1595141715|4.0|This is a difficult topic for kids and parents to discuss.  The reality, however, is that many kids think about suicide or have friends thinking about suicide, so this book can be a good ice breaker to discuss the topic.    Con:  The book did not have a debriefing chapter at the end.  I realize that as a novel, this is not necessary.  It just concerns me that with a topic to serious, it would be important to have this, especially in the case of the many teenagers who are reading that do not have parents discussing it with them.  The point in the book was not to glorify suicide, however, as a result, it kind of minimized suicide.  My daughter thought that it would be easy to kill yourself by taking pills (the method of this character) and it opened up a discussion about the realities of attempted suicides by overdosing on pills, including the fact that you could just do permanent damage to your body and that it is really difficult to overdose on pills that are readily available.  The book does not debrief about the fact that none of these 13 reasons are really reasons to kill yourself and that they all have realistic solutions to dealing with them.  Likewise, it let's the reader assume that if they have ever done any one of the 13 things, they are reallly really bad, could be at fault for causing someone to kill themselves, etc.  I talked with my daughter about the fact that while people should not do anything to hurt others intentionally, the reality is that sometimes we do hurt others, dispite our best efforts--and that doesn't make us bad.  If you know about it, you can apologize, but you may never know that you even hurt their feelings--if their behavior and words are appropriate, they need not worry all the time about how they made others feel (my daughter would have done this after reading this book if we hadn't gotten to talk about it).      Also, like some reviewers have mentioned, the book does not delve into the fact that ultimately this girl had a problemthat needed to be addressed and that it is because of that problem that she killed herself.  There is only 1 line in the entire book, easily missed, that indicates, perhaps she shouldn't have killed herself over these things.  I understand that it doesn't fit well within the context of the novel, however, it would be good in a debriefing chapter.      The book was a quick read and kept you going back for more to find out what was going to be next.  I would say it was definitely meant for 11 year olds - teens and isn't that great for adults (but if your kid is reading it, you should too).    Throughout the book, it was mentioned a few times, why didn't she just say something to me, if she did, I could have told her what I meant, or, if she had only spoken up about how she felt, we could help her.  Again these lines were easy to miss but were said a few times--sending a good message to speak up if you feel this way.    This book as the potential to save lives if children read it and call the crisis numbers in the back, speak to guidance counselors, speak to parents, or even they discuss them amongst themselves and one in the group is psychologically sophisticated and has been debriefed about it themselves.  On the flip side, I suppose it could be used by someone seriously suicidal to go ahead and do it--after all, it never made it a bad thing and in fact, for kids with certain diagnosis, it made it an attractive thing because at least 14 people had to listen and think about those tapes and reflect on her, giving her much more attention than she would have received if she had remained alive.    To sum it up:  I would not hesitate having my child read this if I or a professional  could speak to them after.  If you find out your child has read it, quickly read it and start talking about it.  What did they like?  How would they feel if they had gotten a tape?  Do you think those were the ONLY reasons she killed herself?  Do you know anyone who has thought about suicide?Have you ever thought about suicide?  if so, have you ever thought about doing it?   AND then, please seek professional help for your child if they have thought about suicide, even if they are not currently planning to kill themselves.

When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future.

B00000G3I2|5.0|This an awesome movie
B00005JPO1|1.0|I grew up watching the Indian Jones movies. I had a special love for the swashbuckling archaeologist that surpassed even Batman or Wolverine from the X-men largely because I am from Indiana originally. I loved him the way a child loves their hero. Watching this movie made me feel like someone drove a twelve inch iron spike straight through the center of my heart.<br /><br />There are so many reasons to hate this movie, virtually all of which have been adequately detailed in other reviews. However, my reason for hating it is deeply personal, but intensified by the many travesties in judgment made by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg. Watching an ancient Indy scramble around set after ridiculous set, watching him cavort around like an aged shadow of himself, treated like a mannequin by the director, used, abused, sad, and ultimately tossed aside for the younger and horribly miscast Shia LaBeouf, made me want to throw up.<br /><br />This isn't a good movie. I don't care if you like the other Indy movies or not, it just flat out is a failure of cinema that I wish I could erase from my memory. The sanctity of all that is good and holy demands it.<br /><br />0/5 Stars. Worthless. Awful. Sad. Depressing.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|I'm pleased with the dvd
0312360266|1.0|I really wanted to like this book. The cover was interesting, the general theme and storyline was some-what good. I know this book was aimed at young adults and thats why they tried to keep the language clean....but I'm sorry NO teenager talks like these kids did. I felt as if this story was written by an 11 year old for 11 years olds. I'm an adult and I don't mind vulgarness in a book, but if you are writing a story for young adults and use words such as \\"pooh\\" in place of swear words....you really messed things up when you describe the scene of oral sex in the hallways.  My other big complaint is this... I like Vampire books. This book reminded me more of a witch-craft story with all the goddess, chants, spirits, strage tattoos that magically appear. If the kids didn't like the taste/smell of blood there would be nothing in this book screaming \\"vampire\\". All in all, I am sort of wondering what will happen next....but reading some of the others reviews of the following books...makes me feel as if I will just continue to be annoyed a disappointed. I am obsessed with the Twilight series (which is also aimed at the YA crowd.....they are just an example of Vampire young adult boooks done right! Save your money on this one!!!!!

031606792X|1.0|....but this is one of the examples of a book I simply could not finish. I have slogged my way through books whose 'classic' status I don't fully understand. I've also plugged my way through dozens of young adult novels whose points are still beyond me.  This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Poorly written, its almost as if Stephenie Meyer allowed one of her tween fans write this novel for her. The entire book gives you the feeling that the publishers let a piece of crap book onto the market simply because they knew how bad it was and didn't care, and they knew that no matter how bad it was, millions would still have bought it (they were right, after all). Characters felt out of place and, well, out of character. Everyone whined incessantly about the troubles they were having, when overall when you look at their situations, they didn't have any real troubles! The book flowed uneventfully from one mindless missing plot point to another. They got married (yay!), had sex repeatedly for an interminable 500 pages, got pregnant (despite mentioning a half million words earlier that vampires don't have bodily fluids) and everything else happened in slow, yammering succession as baby came in, was named wincingly after everyone in the book but the pizza delivery guy, and Bella (in disgustingly easy fashion) became a vampire after nearly dying in childbirth.  Bella complains as she gets everything her little selfish teenage heart desired, but she still found plenty to be nervous and unhappy about even as it all fell into place without a hitch. Daddy reluctantly accepted her new family and her fate, figuring what he didn't know wouldn't hurt him (whatever). And nothing really happened in the way of action to help move the story along. Jacob imprinted on the baby (can you spell 'creepy?), which conveniently moved him out of the way in the whole Bella-Edward-Jacob triangle, and the baby herself is a human (sort of) dynamo, with the ability to both reach adulthood in herabject perfection and live forever.  There is another huge disappointment in this novel. Eclipse gave us a hint of a life without Edward, but with what most humans would consider a great deal of happiness for Bella with Jacob. Her vision of the two of them together, and two children, was a beautiful moment, and I felt at the time that it was a sign that Bella would choose Jacob, and her life would not have to flip upside down, there would be no more talk of becoming a vampire, on and on. Not so much.  There are few enough redeeming points in this book that I can't really remember them, and I had had enough by 535 pages in. I closed the book, put it on my dresser, and next time my Mom asked about it, I gladly handed it over. When she refused to finish it at about the same point I did, we sent it to my sister, with whom I've shared several shocked conversations about the state of this novel.  *update* I have finally, almost 2 years after its release, worked my way through Breaking Dawn. All of that build-up, all the suspense about the Volturi coming, I really believed that maybe when I put it down the first time I tried to read it, I may have missed some excitement! Wow, was that a stupid assumption. 756 pages of pent-up tension over the Volturi coming, and their daughter (I refuse to type that stupid name) touches them a few times and they just go, &#34;Peace!&#34; and leave. Give me a break.  Meyer has said she wanted to give the series to have a happy ending. I understand and condone her goal. Who wants to read thousands of pages of the same story just to have it end badly. But here's a point I have to make: another series that has had its share of comparison and contrast with Twilight, Harry Potter had a happy ending, but bad stuff still happened, characters you'd loved for years still died, and Deathly Hallows was a page-turning, can't-put-it-down read. Breaking Dawn is not.w times and they just go, \\"Peace!\\" and leave. Give me a break.    Meyer has said she wanted to give the series to have a happy ending. I understand and condone her goal.

076535618X|5.0|The Last Colony is the conclusion of John Scalzi's science fiction trilogy that began with Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades.  The first novel followed John Perry as he left Earth to become a super-soldier for the Colonial Defense Force and met Jane Sagan, the Special Forces soldier created from the genetic material of John's late wife.  The Ghost Brigades, among other things hinted at the formation of an alliance of alien planets called the Conclave, that threatened to stop human colonization.  In The Last Colony, the Conclave is fully formed and John will be tangled in a plot to stop this organization.    As the novel opens, John and Jane are living and working on a colony planet called Huckleberry, along with their adopted teenage daughter Zoe.  Zoe, for reasons linked to The Ghost Brigades, is something of a goddess to a race called the Obin, and is watched over by a pair of the aliens known as Hickory and Dickory (named by Zoe when she was much younger).  The two are offered a chance to lead and help establish a new colony to be called Roanoke.    Roanoke is special for a couple reasons.  For one thing, unlike other human colonies that were populated solely by residents of Earth, Roanoke's colonists will come only from other colonies.  In addition, as the first colony to be established after the founding of the Conclave, it is likely to be opposed by that alliance.  In fact, soon John and Jane will find that Roanoke is to be a pawn in a dangerous game played by the Colonial Union.    First, the colonists find they have been sent to a different planet than expected, and once there, are completely cut off from the rest of the CU.  This isolation is designed to keep them from being discovered by the Conclave.  To make this isolation worse, the colonists cannot go home and cannot even use any significant technology.  What's worse, this new planet was not fully surveyed, and contains another hostile intelligent race who are soon known as the werewolves.  Eventually, the veil will be lifted as the CU plans a special attack on the Conclave, one that will have unexpected consequences.    All of which places John and Jane in a precarious situation, forced to play the CU's game even though they could die in the process.  It becomes more and more apparent that the CU may represent humans, but does so by monopolizing the flow of people and information, a practice that threatens humanity almost as much as the Conclave.    Like its predecessors, The Last Colony is a good book, one that should delight fans as it brings John and Jane back.  The only real flaw is the subplot with the werewolves, which Scalzi seems to more-or-less drop as the main story hits its full stride.  Happily, this problem does not overly detract from the book's overall quality.  While it should not be read as a standalone book, The Last Colony will please fans of his earlier works.

B000U1ZV8K|5.0|Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino may be a couple of the greatest actors around, but as shown in the recent movie Righteous Kill, they don't necessarily work together well.  That movie had a lot of problems, but what stood out to me was there was little chemistry between the two:  they didn't work well as a team.  Chemistry is important:  it can make a so-so story entertaining, and a good one great.  While it's not really a knock against them, Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are rarely considered in the same acting league as DeNiro and Pacino (or at least the DeNiro and Pacino of past decades; their recent performances have been less impressive); nonetheless, they work great together.  They are more that the sum of their parts, as shown in the Lethal Weapon series of movies.    While few would consider this quartet of movies as Oscar caliber, they are not meant to be:  they are action-comedies.  In the original Lethal Weapon, the emphasis is more on the action.  Gibson is Riggs, a detective on the brink of suicide after the death of his wife.  Instead of killing himself, he constantly puts himself in dangerous situations.  Glover, as Murtaugh, is the complete opposite of Riggs:  he's a sober family man who constantly laments that he is too old for this stuff (okay, the word isn't stuff, but you get the idea).  Partnered together, they investigate some murders tied to drug runners who are ex-Special Forces, just like Riggs.  This sets us a final showdown between Riggs and a veteran soldier played by Gary Busey.    In Lethal Weapon 2, Riggs is no longer suicidal, but he still is rather wild; his antics get the pair assigned to protect an accountant-for-the-mob named Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci).  They also tangle with some South African drug runners who hide behind diplomatic immunity (this movie was filmed when apartheid was still in full flower).  With the appearance of Getz, the movies start to expand the family of characters, something that will continue in future movies.Lethal Weapon 3 has Murtaugh on the brink of retirement and trying to avoid all those things that get cops killed right before they retire.  Of course, with Riggs as a partner, that isn't going to happen.  The plot deals with an ex-cop who is selling weapons to the local gangs.  It also introduces Rene Russo as Riggs's love interest; she's almost as tough as he is, leading to a comic romantic scene where they compete to see who has the best scar.      Lethal Weapon 4 has both characters being promoted from sergeant directly to captain, an effort by the department to tie the two to desks where they can't cause as much destruction.  As they take on some Chinese mobsters led by Jet Li, Riggs has to deal with impending fatherhood (Russo's character is pregnant) and whether he can remarry.  Murtaugh has to deal with impending grandfatherhood, while unaware that his daughter is secretly married to a fellow cop played by Chris Rock.      As the series develops, the emphasis is more and more on comedy, with the serious elements pushed aside.  There are, in all the movies, plenty of gunfights, chases and things blowing up, all of which will satisfy action movie fans.  The stories, however, do get weaker as they go along.  By Lethal Weapon 4, the writing itself is a bit lacking, but the sheer chemistry that the characters have with each other helps prop up the material.  Credit should also be given to Richard Donner, who directed all four movies.  It ain't Shakespeare, but these are all fun movies to watch.

The Project Mogul balloon theory holds little water, yet the USAF still hold firm to it.  They still deny the American people the truth.

It has been digitally enhanced.

B001U8ZSCG|5.0|One of my first thoughts after the movie was how well the music fit; I like the irony that some of the songs bring to the moment and as a commenter said connects the scenes to the times they are in. I don't think how common or not the music is should factor into a soundtrack's rating - Forrest Gump is a good example. I hadn't read the graphic novel before watching the movie but picked it up right after - several songs were part of the original graphic novel.  Good article about this  soundtrack: [...]

1603580557|5.0|Pretty much everything in the universe can be viewed as part of a system.   Thinking in Systems by Donella Meadows covers general ideas of which most people have at least an intuitive grasp, such as feedback loops, depletion of resources, escalation, the \\"Tragedy of the Commons,\\" etc., but does so in a clear, highly unified way that provides far more \\"Aha!\\" moments than one would expect could be gleaned from the seemingly simple subject matter.  This is in keeping with a basic theme of the book -- that it's really how parts of the system are connected that determine its behavior and effects, not the parts themselves.  Again, seemingly obvious, but in Meadows's system of a book, a revelation, and a necessary antidote to overly-simplistic, linear, cause-and-effect, myopic ways of thinking that tend to drive popular opinion, government policies, business management and individual behavior.

8478886567|3.0|I read the first Harry Potter book in Spanish, and while it wasn't a perfect translation, I really enjoyed it.  I was fluent enough that I averaged having about 1 or 2 (and often none) words that I had to look up per page, so I was excited when I finished and quickly ordered the second book.  Well, it arrived, and with a shock I realized I could barely get through this one.  The reading is extremely slow due to the fact I have to look up so many words per page (and many of them aren't even in my (very good) Spanish-English dictionary), and because even when the words are ones I know, the whole way the sentences are structured is different and much more difficult from the traditional Spanish I know (I've studied in school and lived in Mexico in order to become fluent).  I checked and sure enough, the books were translated by different people.  The translators of this book (and the third and fourth, unfortunately) are from Spain, and as such, use a lot of very Spain-specific vocabulary, idioms, and sentence structures (and the vosotros verb form), that, while still being readable, make the book much more difficult and less enjoyable.  I got bored and quit somewhere in chapter five, because instead of reading and enjoying a story, I was laboriously and constantly switching back and forth between my dictionary and the actual book.    If you are from Spain or have learned your Spanish in a Spain context, versus in Latin America, I'm sure this book will be a great translation and very fun to read.  However, for the rest of the Spanish speaking world, this book is slightly more of a chore.
B001E75QGG|1.0|Be warned:  Spoilers ahead.    A 60+ year old man climbs into an old 1950's era fridge to seek shelter from the impact of a nuclear blast.  I know, those fridges back then were strong, no doubt.  I don't think the contents inside would have been fried, but this fridge was thrown for what seemed to be a mile before finally crashing hard to the ground.  Surely anything inside, while not completely toasted, should have been beaten and broken from all of the impact.  Right?  Well this 60+ year old man walks out relatively UNSCATHED!    That's just a taste of bad things to come if you continue to watch this ridiculous movie.  The jeep chase through the jungle, Shia Labeouf's character swinging through the jungle his first time ever touching a vine, and (whispering voice)the big reveal about the Shia character's relationship to Indy.  Oooooh, you'll never guess...if you're a moron.      There were many, MANY instances where I had to force myself to sit through it.  It was a struggle for me not to turn off my player.  I got throuhg it because I wanted to see if there was anyting good about it.  I now regret it.    So now Shcumacher's 'Batman and Robin' now has a close friend on my \\"Worst Movies I've Ever Seen\\" list.  'Crystal Skull' is like an epic comedy...that's not funny at all.

I spent the entire book hoping that the ending would actually be a suprise, and, nope, it wasn't.<br /><br />This book is well-written, but the language can not even COMPARE to mystic river.  That book is in a different league than this one - I honestly feel like \\"Shutter Island\\" could have been written by a lot of artists in the genre.

B00005N5RM|5.0|I am a fanatic for the first, 1950s THE BLOB, as well as the swingin', cheeze-log 70s version, BEWARE! THE BLOB!. In this 80s update, we get a cheerleader (Shawnee Smith from Saw) and a local tough-guy (Kevin \\"Not Matt\\" Dillon) who try to convince the sleepy town of Arborville that a giant alien mass is eating its way through the population. In keeping with the original, no one believes them. This time out, we get the added attraction of a massive government conspiracy! The best aspect of the new one is its superior SFX, complete w/ rampaging protoplasm and its realistically dissolving victims! My favorite scenes include the \\"disintegrating football jock\\", \\"man sucked down the sink drain\\" \\"phonebooth waitress squish\\", and \\"imploding dream-date\\" sequences! There are even a few nods to the Steve McQueen version in the meteor, freezer and movie theatre scenes. Co-written by Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, The Mist). A worthy addition to the BLOB legacy...                P.S.- It's always a treat to see Candy Clark (American Graffiti, The Man Who Fell To Earth) in anything. Her endearing waitress character is memorable...

0780626494|4.0|I say this movie is a bit sad because it shows how far off base this country has drifted. Brendan Fraser turns in a great performance as a 35 year old 'kid' who's been raised with the sort of values that have been long since forgotten by today's society, by parents who are stuck in a time warp. Well written, well acted, and just plain hilarious while making a sad commentary on the state of our 'advancement'. I don't generally watch romantic comedies, but had to make space for this one in my collection after seeing it on cable.
B000AY74OG|2.0|Love the Movie. Ordered it from Amazon for Christmas and didnt get it until middle of February. I had to call Amazon twice. The first time they appologized and told me they would send another movie right away. The movie never arrived so I called again. Very dissappointed with Amazon.
B0015AARJI|5.0|There are lots of reviews on how the Dualshock performs. This is a report on how well it lasts under heavy use. When I bought my second PS3 last May, a 40 gig (came with the non-Dual Shock controller),  I got a second controller, a dual shock. I am a pretty heavy user, on daily for at least a couple of hours. I mostly play either [[ASIN:B00160JSGK NCAA Football 09]] or [[ASIN:B001C4DKG4 SOCOM: US Navy Seals Confrontation Stand Alone]] so that gives you an idea of my type of controller use. I use one of the controllers until I get the battery is low warning and then I swap them on the charging cable. The regular controller that shipped with my PS3 now is having problems with the sticks not being centered when you aren't touching them and the springs on the L2 and R2 are almost gone so if you barely rest your finger on them, you activate them. The Dualshock, on the other hand, is working pretty much just the way it was when I first got it. So after equal play my Dualshock is still pretty much like new 10 months after getting it and the one that shipped with the PS3 the sticks aren't centered so you drift around and the button springs are shot. So, time to get another Dualshock.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Accelerate is the fifth CD of R.E.M.'s that I have (Out of Time, Automatic for the People, Monster, and Reveal being the others), and this one is my favorite.  It is impressive for a band to still be releasing new music 25 years after their first album.  Accelerate is a more pure rock CD than what they've done recently.  They also went for much shorter tracks with the 11 songs coming in at just over 34 minutes.<br /><br />The opener \\"Living Well Is The Best Revenge\\" gets things started with a bang.  Here Stipe thumbs his nose at his detractors - \\"I'm not one to sit and spin/'cos living well is the best revenge.\\"  The next song \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" is a little bit slower, but it has hooks galore.  This has been one of my favorites since the first time I played the CD.  However the standout song of the CD is the title track.  It makes the CD nice and symmetrical with its being the sixth song.  Here Stipe seems to be pondering the state of the world and his own mortality, but introspection is nothing new to R.E.M. songs.  \\"Sing For The Submarine\\" is the longest song on the CD, but it finds Stipe exploring similar territory.  \\"Horse To Water\\" has a bit of a punk feel to it which is supported by its short length.  The closer \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" is an interesting number that would almost seem more at home on a B-52's CD, but it winds up giving the listener some variety at the end.  Perhaps this is what the next R.E.M. CD will sound like?<br /><br />Overall, Accelerate is a very good offering from R.E.M.  It has a lot of variety to it.  It has much less of the ethereal sound that Reveal had.  Not that Reveal was bad, but it's good to hear them trade in the electronics for a more stripped down guitar driven sound.<br /><br />Download this:  Accelerate
B001FB55Y4|5.0|Gerry Butler never fails to deliver a really good performance, whether it's amusing or intense, and he's done it again. He tells so much of the character's thoughts with his expressions that he commands your attention when he's on screen. The entire cast does a good job, and the movie moves along, actually at an almost hectic pace, so a person really needs to watch the movie at least twice.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|I watched season 3 on video on demand from showtime. It was great watching the whole season straight through without waiting a week in between each one. I'm not sure I could have waited between shows to know what happened! The show gets better and better all the time. This season had Dexter making friends with the assistant DA who was played by Jimmy Smits. It begins with Dexter killing his brother kind of by accident but of course the d.a. doesn't know that part and wants him to find the killer since he shows such a talent for helping out in that department. Interesting concept, huh. Find the killer when you are the killer! Does this deter Dexter from becoming his friend anyway? Not a bit. This season also has Rita pregnant. Will Dexter do the right thing and marry her? Or better yet, SHOULD he marry her? I mean what is going to happen when there is a little Dexter around? Will big Dexter take him to soccer games or to the shooting range? It will be interesting seeing what kind of daddy Dexter makes! Jimmy Smit plays his role well and it's funny watching poor old Dexter trying to become a friend to someone when the concept is so alien to him. But we want him to have a friend as bad as he wants one, because we truly like Dexter. He tries so hard to do the right thing by his friends and if it meant turning himself in rather than killing a friend, then we believe that is what he would do. He almost had to do that at the end of last season when Doaks figured out what he was...but one of the women who loved Dexter took care of the problem for him. Those women of his will always take care of Dexter when they can. And now that he's marrying one of them, she can't testify against him if she ever figures out what he is (not much chance of that since she considers him a great guy). But guess what...that thought has not crossed his mind yet. He's very naive where women are concerned. That just makes you like him more and you want those women there to protect him since you can't! Watch it, you'll love it!'t! Watch it, you'll love it!
B000025RX4|3.0|After not hearing this album since my days in high school i was looking forward to checking it out once again. Much to my surprise i was shocked at the crummy sound quality on this disc. The drums and bass are mixed down too low and there seems to be a continual hiss or \\"scratchy\\" sound thru out the cd. At first i had thought it was put out by some other independent label other than Columbia but upon inspection the disc does say \\"Columbia\\" on it so...why the crummy sound? It also stated that the cd was an \\"import\\" so maybe that had something to do with it. This cd does have its moments however with such great songs as \\"Prodigal Son\\",\\"On the Limb\\" and of course \\"Rock and Roll Hoochie Koo\\" plus the twin guitars of both Johnny Winter and Rick Derringer. I can only hope that Columbia will put this back out one day with the proper re-mastered sound it deserves.But for now,be forewarned about the lousy sound on this one.

The pop ups are big, they are small and the information that goes along with them keeps my 8 year old going back to read over and over.

B00005JPY2|4.0|For the uninitiated:   This film based on the acclaimed comic book by Alan Moore & Dave Gibbons is set in a world slightly skewed from our own. What if superheroes had existed since the early 20th century? How would they skew our own history--Vietnam for instance? The bulk of \\"Watchmen\\" is set in the 1980s when the USA & Russia are on the brink of nuclear war. Superheroes were outlawed during President Nixon's 3rd term in office and now someone is killing off the retired heroes. The film uses flashbacks to give history on each of the Watchmen as the world ticks ever closer to nuclear annihilation.     Purists will likely have complaints about deviations from the source material, but they should be few as \\"Watchmen\\" has to be one of the most faithful adaptations of a comic book ever realized on screen. \\"Watchmen\\" is a well paced, violent, adult (male and female nudity is prominent), comic book film that uses extraordinary characters and situations to explore some of the most basic aspects of humanity.    For the fans who've read the comic:   [Spoilers Below!!!]  +  +  +  Some minor drawbacks to the film include the make-up. The younger characters made to look older were terrible! Ditto for Nixon and all the other \\"real\\" characters like Ted Koppel and such. The make-up was so disturbingly unrealistic that it really killed the moment whenever they were on screen--Nixon especially. People in the theater actually laughed when he came on screen to announce DEFCON One!    I also thought the role of Ozymandias really needed a bigger name star--or at least an actor who could command more of a presence on screen. Way back when Snyder took over as director Tom Cruise's name was thrown around for the role and I think he would've been perfect for the part.    However, my biggest problem with the film is the same problem I had with the comic book--the ending. The only way to avert global nuclear annihilation is through some random culling? We simply know that's not true now. I don't know, maybe it's because I nuclear war was never a real fear for me growing up. Maybe that's why I could not relate to the weight of this seemingly impending doom on the characters in the story; even with devices like the \\"Doomsday Clock\\" and newspaper headlines to try and convey this real fear of the story's characters it never connected w/ me as an audience member/reader.    Dr. Manhattan's floppy blue wang gets WAY more screen time than necessary. Ditto for the number of shots of man-butt. And I saw it in IMAX so whenever I held up my hand to obscure Dr. M's junk it did no good.    Gratuitous male nudity aside, the movie rocked! I'm not a big fan of the comic. I read it back around 2001 and liked it enough, but I don't hold it with the reverence hardcore fans do. However, after watching the film I do want to go back and read the comic again. I'll likely do this before I buy it on DVD--and this movie is begging for the 3-disc in-depth DVD treatment.    The flashbacks and the reveal of each character's back story were handled beautifully. I agree w/ everyone else in that Silk Spectre II & Nite Owl II came off as the most sympathetic. But Rorschach was the real star of the film for me. His journal entries narrate the film as it did the comic, and he remains the only un-compromised character--the only one solely dedicated to justice. The Comedian & Rorschach had the meatiest roles and both actors did an outstanding job in the roles. \\"Watchmen\\" will not disappoint!

1595822003|4.0|This is probably one of the best, if not the best of, illustrated editions of Shelley's novel ever published. Despite the very ordinary and quite out of place introduction by Stephen King (given the quality of the hardcover volume and the Wrightson illustrations within - it begs an introduction by someone who knows something more of literature and of art), I'd certainly recommend this as being on the shelf of anyone who appreciates fine plates of art amidst a fine work. The detail Wrightson puts into the scenes in his attempts to visualise the tale is sometimes breathtaking.

1595478728|5.0|Indeed there is no one like G.K. in our generation though not a few have been nourished by his poetic brilliance and second naivete. His sentences are packed full of witty logic that teases our minds to active thought. If one simply reads it like a text book trying to reproduce the arguments later, it will not do the text justice. It is the sort of book that provokes you to think rather than does the thinking for you.<br /><br />The book has many memorable quotes and they jump out at you every now and then when one engages other books that deal with similar subjects as explored here - creeds, apologetics, orthodoxy, rationality, myths, etc. Recently there has been a rehash of some old charges at Christianity for being too meek on the one hand (as in 'turn the other cheek') and too violent on the other (the Crusades, witch hunt, etc), I'm once again reminded of Chesterton's poignant remark that the critics are often shooting from both sides of the mouth and end up totally incoherent. 'What if the reason why we find the man in question (ie. Jesus) either too thin or fat is because he is of the right shape, and we are the odd ones?' quips GK. The point is that the Christian faith is so richly textured and paradoxed that it could not have been invented by mere logic. It is so intricately shaped as the key to the world's many faceted-questions and mysteries. G.K. makes the Christian creeds come alive as a rich and life-changing narrative that renders all heresies thin, fluffy and dull by comparison indeed!

B000002KYK|5.0|This is the orchestral version (released in 1982) of the soundtrack, music written by Vangelis, from the movie 'Blade Runner'. Although the Vangelis soundtrack (released in 1994) faithfully recreates the original mood as well as having additional songs and different arrangements...<br /><br />...the arrangements from this orchestral adaption are just as good and in some cases even exceed the official Vangelis soundtrack!<br /><br />Specifically, the vocal parts from \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\" and it's \\"AM distant quality radio effect\\" works very well, in my opinion.  Another favorite is \\"End Title\\" which has a Tangerine Dream type of arpeggiator/sequencer effect and isn't included on the Vangelis soundtrack. Finally, Memories of Green is just a wonderful arrangement. Whether or not you like the movie, the music is something very special. Very Nice job to Vangelis and to the New American Orchestra! Both versions recommended.<br /><br />~
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I'm not unhappy with my Swivel Sweeper, but if I knew then what I know now, I'd probably pass up its purchase. It's VERY good for getting under beds between those times when someone with muscles is around to move furniture for you. You still have to get down on the floor to do that, though, which at my age isn't much fun. It picks up really well, but I hate cleaning it. The handle is kinda flimsy, but works well if you don't whip it around all over the place. It holds its charge as I'd expect it to do for it's size, and it's great on throw rugs that have the latex backing. What you see on TV is what you get. The only thing you don't see on the commercials is that it's a noisy little bugger. And, I agree, it's over-priced.
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin kissed any band goodbye with Physical Graffiti. From Custard Pie to Sick Again, this is an album of pure artistic and spiritual perfection. Also Jimmy Page made sure everything sounded so powerful and brilliant with a lot of depth and a live feel to it.<br /><br />Let's face it: this is it for a rock band. How can you top the inventiveness and vision of Kashmir? Or In The Light? What about topping the sheer power and class of The Wanton Song or The Rover?<br /><br />This album does make Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones & John Bonham the gods and devils of rock altogether. The thing is, this is Zeppelin on top of their game and to me this means unsurpassed beauty.<br /><br />Physical Graffiti is a timeless gift of music, it will always be as powerful as it ever was. There's no dimming of its brilliance and impact.
0930289234|2.0|First of all, frankly, until the movie was in production, I had never had much interest in reading this \\"graphic novel\\", I, of course, had heard of it, it's sort of urban legend.  I have to admit, after reading it, I am totally perplexed as to what all the fuss was about.  Taking into account that the subtext is very dated; it was written in the 80's at the height of Reagan, I just found it oddly pedantic and sort of precious.  I did like the character Rorchach, his musing, sort of non sequitor, were very funny, I felt he above all else resonated.  On the other hand, Dr. Manhattan's musing were like reading Henry James by way of Einstein..very laborious reading, and yes, I got the subtext of his argument, but geez it was dry.  The romance angle seemed very sophomoric, like it was written by somebody who had never had a date.  The character Ozymandias was the limit, I mean, this guy is straight out of the worst of Bond..I mean a Ramses II and Alexander complex, give me a break, he of course is pivotal to the book, but he was ridiculous, an Arctic Lair, are you kidding me?!!  His \\"final solution\\" is beyond nuts and Dr. Manhattan sums his arrogant naive stupidity up perfect at the end.  Last, but not least, well maybe least, was the \\"famous\\" pirate story imbeded in the overall story arch.  At first, I must admit, I found this story much more stimulating than the, past, present, and future story arch of Watchman, I started to think I was going to need a dramamine, the way Watchman kept falling back on itself, them speeding forward..anway back to the Pirate, like I said, it was really interestig at first, then it just sort of went really bizarre and abruptly ended, I was like, this is It?!!..im sure it was a metaphor, but still it seemed abrupt and as for the Squid, well, it is a perfect metaphor for this \\"novel\\"..a bloated corpse, existing for no apparent reason.

B001FB55H6|1.0|In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cute Super Hero story!<br /><br />This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war Americans funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....)<br /><br />Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's profound political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film - as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting Americans vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically, is an understatement!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:027599435X Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System (Contemporary Psychology)]] and [[ASIN:145552297X The Trial of Henry Kissinger]] and [[ASIN:0520271416 How We Forgot the Cold War: A Historical Journey across America]]ering a Destructive System (Contemporary Psychology)]] and [[ASIN:145552297X The Trial of Henry Kissinger]] and [[ASIN:0520271416 How We Forgot the Cold War: A Historical Journey across America]]
B000PFUAO6|5.0|It is interesting how reviews of music can vary so much among individual fans of a band.  Music is a very personal experience and it is difficult to get a good idea of what you will or will not like by reading someone elses' review.  That being said I have been following DT since the mid-late 80's and have listened critically to all of their works.  I found this to be one of their best, along with Dream and Day  and Scenes.  As always the music is complex but not without purpose or theme.  DT seems to be trending towards harder themes in the last few albums which I for one welcome.  I could see how some people can draw comparisons between some of the themes and those of more hardcore metal bands.  I have been listening to this one since it arrived about 5 months ago and I have not lost interest yet which is very unusual for me.  If you happen to prefer some of their \\"softer\\" albums like Awake or Images, then this may not be for you.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|First I want to say that this series is great and if you haven't seen it yet or are unsure about it, the second season is currently airing on AMC, so try to catch a few of them to get a better understanding. If you like those episodes or if you're one of the people who already love this series then this DVD boxed set is for you. It contains the complete first season of AMC's Breaking Bad in seven one hour long episodes.    In short the plot is a more serious Bryan Cranston than we've seen playing chemistry teacher Walter White, who gets diagnosed with cancer. With a son, Walter Jr, who is disabled and a wife, Skyler, who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students, Jesse. The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer's, increasing extended family issues with his wife's sister, Marie, and to top it off a bother in law, Hank, who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.    The episodes found on this set are:    Ep 1: Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer. With a new lease on life, Walter becomes a drug dealer to secure his family's financial security.  Aired: 1/20/2008    Ep 2: Cat's in the Bag... - Following their debacle in the desert, Walter and Jesse are left with a mess to dispose of. Later, Skyler grows suspicious of Walt's recent activity.  Aired: 1/27/2008     Ep 3: ...and the Bag's in the River - Walter is left to deal with Krazy-8 alone following an argument with Jesse. After Marie raises concerns that Walt Jr. is smoking cannabis, Hank shows him the dangers of drug use.  Aired: 2/10/2008     Ep 4: Cancer Man - The DEA becomes suspicious of a new drug kingpin. Walt reveals that he has cancer to Marie and Hank. Elsewhere, Jesse visits his estranged family.  Aired: 2/17/2008    Ep 5: Gray Matter - Walter and Skyler attend a former colleague's party. Jesse tries free himself from the drugs. Later, Skyler organizes an intervention for Walt.  Aired: 2/24/2008     Ep 6: Crazy Handful of Nothin' - The side effects of chemo begin to plague Walt, who is also cooking meth again. Jesse's friend, Skinny Pete, introduces him to a distributor named Tuco, but things go awry and Jesse ends up hospitalised.  Aired: 3/2/2008     Ep 7: A No-Rough-Stuff Type Deal - Walter accepts his new identity as a drug dealer after a PTA meeting. Elsewhere, Jesse decides to put his aunt's house on the market, and Skyler is the recipient of a baby shower.  Aired: 3/9/2008    Some people have said that the new season has taken too long to air but they must not realize AMC and HBO take a year between seasons of all their big shows. The second season is currently airing (started March 8th 2009), which happens to be one year after the first. Only the first episode into the second season and already it's become more riveting, intense, dramatic and complex than the first season. The second season premiere really left us with a shocking ending that leaves one eagerly awaiting how the rest of the season will follow.    I feel this show and the quality being put into it will help make it the next version of the Wire, while Mad Men is more like the equivilant to the next version of Sopranos yet both shows are something entirely of their own. I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try. Breaking Bad's first season barely broke the surface of these character's and the storyline possibilties they hold. Thanks for your time.    *Rather than clutter up the review page I have listed the special features included with this set in my comments section for those wondering about them.
0618918248|5.0|Before reading this book, I had my doubts about the nature of god as portrayed by the world's religions. I was what the book describes as a \\"Deist\\". While reading this book, I was impressed by the logic behind Dawkins' arguments and the ruthless precision in which he went after the construct of god. Instead of wasting time trying to disprove an imaginary being, he goes after the very idea of god as it is presented to us in life. If our concept of god is completely based on human understanding and ideals, god will be a product of the humans who created him. This explains why god is irrational, jealous, genocidal, indecisive, and curiously, so interested in human affairs when there are a billion galaxies with a billion stars in each to consider. This book completely annihilated my concept of god, and was a contributing factor to my de-conversion to atheism. Richard Dawkins shows himself to be a true student of science and a master of logical argument. I recommend this book to the faithful and un-faithful alike :)
B00009V7T2|5.0|There aren't too many bands that truly get me as charged up as The Mars Volta. This album was my introduction to their truly original and brilliant music. There are too many influences to count, and as you listen to different albums you will notice that each one is a truly different piece of art. You will think to yourself \\"Hmm, what genre would this fit in\\". I still don't know how to classify it so good luck.<br /><br />If you appreciate music that isn't the usual instant gratification we have all become so accustomed to, you will find this band to be an inspiring and challenging excursion. One tip: Never, ever ever try to listen to a single Mars Volta song in order to sample their music. Their albums are complete works, think of them as a single song. They are also notorious for hiding the truly infectious hooks within the punctuated psychedelia. If you happen to smoke green stuff, have a listen after indulging. Whatever you do, make sure to listen to at least one entire album before making any judgements. I absolutely hated it the first time I listened, but came back and gave it another chance, and suddenly it all made sense.
0307346617|5.0|I just finished devouring World War Z like a flesh-hungry ghoul! A very compelling read. When I first saw the book in stores, I turned my nose up at it because it looked chaotic and it didn't follow a storyline narrative.<br /><br />Now I can say I'm glad I overcame that prejudice to see World War Z in a new light. By creating an Oral History of the Zombie War, Brooks makes zombies seem very real and very plausible. No Hollywood Zombies here - just cold hard reality in the form of an unthinking untiring plague of undead and humans giving into their darkest natures.<br /><br />What I like about the book is that Brooks covers many aspects of the situation from people from all walks of life - from a smuggler to the Vice President of the United States. You see people at their worst but unlike many pessimistic horror stories you also see people at their best as they rise to the challenges before them. Too often particularly in this genre, it usually just teaches us that in a zombie world, humanity is [...] and is often worse than the zombies themselves. This element is in there but it doesn't dominate the story with that kind of preachiness. It actually offers hope for humanity.<br /><br />A lot of references are made that are unfamiliar to the reader but which are well known to the people living in this post-zombie world (well semi-post zombie world) such as references to battles, failures, and successes. These references only hinted at in the story make World War Z seem all the more real and make the reader hungry for more.<br /><br />Brooks lays out the interviews to make a chronology of the Zombie Plague starting with interviewees retelling the first warnings to their first encounters and working all the way towards the reclaiming the Earth - though zombies still exist. You learn more and more with each interview and some of them turn back and explain earlier incidences or characters. We get to hear straight from these characters and we have to decide for ourselves if they were heroes, villians, cowards, or humanitarians or a bit of everything. And of course it makes the reader wonder what they would have done in a similar situation.<br /><br />Given the book's almost eerily accurate and real feel, my impish side says we should put a copy of it in a time capsule for future generations thousands of years later to find which might make them put in their history books thinking it real.[[ASIN:0307346617 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]wards, or humanitarians or a bit of everything.

I'm an avid reader, and I don't remember EVER having laughed out loud at a book before. This one did it for me, though. I adored the main character, Rebecca, and I loved Sophie Kinsella's writing style. I would actually read this again, and I plan to read many other of her works. I do wish I hadn't seen the movie. The movie is nothing like the book, and should not be compared to it.
B000002KCC|5.0|This is arguably Neil's best album. I do stress arguably due to a great assortment of albums by Young. It is not a vocally beautiful album and to be honest Neil sounds pretty drunk and or high during the process. That said it is a cd of intense emotion and lyrically very strong. From his voice cracking out in \\"Mellow My Mind\\" to the upbeat lead vocals of the deceased Danny Whitten on \\"Come on Baby Let's go Downtown\\", and the agony of \\"Tired Eyes\\", this is a superb album. May be too rough for some sole fans of Harvest or After the Goldrush. Not for the faint of heart, but for the lovers of rock and roll.  *****If you like this album, check out the actual lp, sound quality is interesting in comparison to digital.

Otherwise. its just going to be another good book on the (sarcastic) joy of living in America.    A terrific read for all though!
B00005JPY2|4.0|Wow. What an amazing movie. Watchmen is based on the serial comic of the same name. The story was perfectly and faithfully transferred into film. The film even feels like a comic book and I can remember each picture in the book.<br /><br />What if superheroes and masked vigilantes were involved in the World's most crucial events (Vietnam war, the Cold War, etc.)? The story follows a group of heroes as they try to discover who murdered one of them, The Comedian, and why. It has been prohibited for heroes to use their powers and with the threat of an oncoming nuclear war, they have to make a decision and try to prevent it (circa US 1985).<br /><br />The art direction, special effects were amazing. The fight scenes were graphic and amazingly filmed. Although it is long (2 h 45 mins), I hardly felt it as I was too engrossed in the movie.<br /><br />Billy Crudup gives his character, Dr. Manhattan, the perfect detached  personality that questions whether he has any remaining human proclivities. He was amazing in his performance and so were the other actors. The movie centers around the idea of humanity, hope and the loss of both. The heroes face the decision as to what has to be sacrificed to save the spiraling human race from itself.<br /><br />This is a bold movie, an amazing movie, a must see movie. This was a gorgeous movie. It was an experience to see it. I must see it again. Very graphic (violence and nudity).
0823015033|5.0|I loved this book. I'm now venturing into making art dolls, and thought this was the best book i could have ever bought. It is step by step, 100% how to sculpt from beginning to end. It teaches you everything you would ever need to know on how to sculpt figures. I have had it for 3 days now and read through it at least 15 times. BUY THIS! you won't regret it!

B00005JPY2|3.0|If you've read the Watchmen comic - you'll appreciate the movie. I use the word \\"appreciate\\" and not \\"like\\" or \\"love\\" because the comic novel is too complex to turn into a movie.    If you have no idea about the comic novel, the movie will come across as an unnecessarily long, sort-of-violent, movie that is hard to follow and which people who are easily disturbed will find terrible. The movie comes across like someone read the novel, created a bunch of scenes for the movie and then put them together as best as one could.    This movie with a thought provoking climax at the very end, will not give you a happy movie experience like say 'Iron Man'.    I recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark sci-fi, alternate themes in movies and those looking specifically for something non-mainstream.     If you have read the comic novel and liked it - do watch the movie. Otherwise wait for the DVD. The movie has some cool special effects but overall not great story telling or direction. The entertainment level in this movie is sort of choppy. Therefore I rate it as a 3 stars.
0345495004|5.0|Loving Frank is a treasure. This book is more than the story of Frank Lloyd Wright and his mistress, Mamah Borthwick, it is the story of a woman, who could be any one of us, trying to make her peace with her life, her surroundings, and her relationships.  The text is beautifully written, there is not a word written that does not have a reason for being there.<br /><br />I found both lead characters completely believable and sympathetic.  It gives me tremendous hope that a contemporary writer, Horan, can write so generously on the subject of a woman's struggle with the role of motherhood.  For those of the reviewers who dare to suggest that Mamah, in her time, would not have felt what Horan portrays her as feeling, I say, \\"hogwash.\\"  Don't think for a minute that the women of every generation have had and continue to have the feelings expressed by Mamah Borthwick.  It was the women from her generation, thinking outside their roles as mothers, that got women the vote for goodness sake?!<br /><br />Agree with Mamah's decisions or not, you can clearly understand the reasons she does what she does as well as her torment over the results of her choices.  Mamah makes no apologies to society for her choices nor does she ask for any sympathy, she clearly just wants to BE.  She's even enlightened enough to know that although she aches for her children, it is best to leave them to their daily life without her.  She will have them in her life as they allow and will not place her own needs above theirs.  Truly enlightened, if you ask me.<br /><br />Do not this miss the beautifully written, thought-provoking triumph.
0061537934|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. I am an animal lover & a dog person in particular, but you certainly do not need to be to enjoy reading this life story narrated by a family dog. It is so easy to love this narrator & to care about the other characters in this story- & I really found myself believing that it was a dog telling the story...little things here & there seemed so likely to be actual thoughts that could cross a dog's mind. It's hard to look at my dog now after reading this book & not wonder, \\"What is he thinking right now?\\". You won't regret reading this book, I hope I find more like it to enjoy.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I have read Jane Auston's books.  I hate when the movies not only remove important aspects, but also adds plots that have no root in the book.  Although I liked the movie, I do not recommend to compare it with the book.  It falls short.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This film was absolutely overlooked and neglected at the moment to regard the best options for the recent Academy Award. I guess the fact that \\"Mystic river\\" had been awarded in 2005 was far enough to acknowledge the naked scars of a system, but Clint Eastwood as filmmaker has decided to keep being as Harry Callahan, (but behind camera) a real defender of the brutal and forgotten injustices around so many legal fissures. I think to myself that that attitude corresponds to an accustomed way to react before a presidential year. If you take a look around in this sense, without exception in those years of Presidential elections, the most nominated films deal with comedies, modern fables and epic actions but never with a sensible, brutal and real fact in March 10,1928 when suddenly Walter Collins vanished without leaving traces from his home and his mother - Christine Collins - made the best she could in order to find him.<br /><br />The dramatic tie deals with the fact the police force (much more worried for chasing Mob's members and extremely worried for the terrible crisis of the Great depression) seemed to ignore and overlook the begs and arguments exposed by Mrs. Collins for trying to convince that boy was not her son.<br /><br />The unexpected dramatic twist of the plot will leave you without breadth when the awful truth makes its appearance.<br /><br />The solid script even resisted the inexpressive performance of Mrs. Jollie (think about these three possible choices: Sarah Polley, Charlize Theron or Cate Blanchet) and the lack of effective punch of Jason Butler Harner as the serial killer (think about of Robert Downey Jr., Tim Roth or Willem Dafoe, for instance) Malkovich was -in that leader role- the most emblematic and effective member of the cast.<br /><br />Don't let it pass this admirable and realistic film.
B000002KDS|3.0|This is my favorite Alice Cooper CD. But as with \\"Love It To Death\\", the sound quality is less than desirable. When is Warner Bros. going to remaster this classic, as well as \\"Love It To Death\\" and \\"Muscle Of Love\\"?
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|At last, this fabulous film, supported by an agile script, combines the ethic aspects between duty, popularity, ethical premises about the evilness terrorism and the bureaucratic barriers that obstacles and struggle the patience of the collective of social corpus with breathtaking and explosive sequences.<br /><br />The splendid cast, accurate direction of Christopher Nolan (Memento)  and the overwhelming naturalness given by the unforgettable Heath Ledger as the Joker (made me to forget the previous Nicholson's performance in which the level of evil behavior overcomes all the unthinkable and imaginable)  really captures by far, the total attention of the audience all the way through) became this film as the major cult movie of this saga where there are no heroes but dark knights.<br /><br />Totally recommended.

B001LRJH0U|5.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" is a curious Western where the primary plot has to do with the value and significance of the friendship as posthumous homage to a sincere and incorruptible life of a straightforward man - Virgil Cole (Ed Harris), disposed to make the justice prevails no matter how many miles he must to walk to get it.<br /><br />But through the achievement of his last goal he falls in love with an alluring widow and so after a set of unexpected events the villain of the story becomes a very respectable citizen. But his friend Everett (Viggo Mortensen), has never forgotten the main goal and he will be the executor arm of the natural justice.<br /><br />The dramatic premise has to do with the thin line between the duty, the moral codes and the ethic. That's why Cole reads Emerson and even discusses with Bragg (Jeremy Irons) ethic issues in a very brief but relevant sequence. Both men are well aware about the holes and fissures of a legal system (including a Presidential blessing who liberates this double moral citizen named Bragg) and every one of them will try to make his mission in the stage of life.<br /><br />Everett is -if you may- the outlaw personage (no family; no hopes for the recent future) who scrutinizes, watches and nourishes day after day his hidden admiration by Cole. That's why Cole tells him. \\"The feelings may destroy you and distort your whole perception about the life's role. That's why Everett is not at the same level than Cole.\\"<br /><br />Ed Harris(after his debut as director with \\"Pollock\\")demonstrates outstanding merits at the role of director. A very zealous camera handle with wonderful nocturnal illumination and arresting angles (like the gun duel, the dramatic sequence of the train).<br /><br />Once more, we are conscious about the Western transcendence simply denies to die because neither more nor less, this is the mythic genre per excellence that wrought the untamed spirit of a nation after the horror of the Civil War.<br /><br />Truly, a recent Classic Western.

0143038583|5.0|Human's have it pretty good. Unlike, say, the koala, which only has to consider which<br />eucalyptus tree to climb in order to have yet another meal of eucalyptus leaves, humans are omnivores, able to make a meal from a variety of plants, animals, and fungi. This has, in part, allowed humans to live in all parts of the world - from the humid tropics of the jungle, to the dry, sandy deserts of the middle east, to the cold, unforgiving quiet of the frozen tundra.<br /><br />But this ease of making a meal, no matter what the environment, has turned what was once a survival advantage for our species, when humans first struggled to spread across the globe tens of thousands of years ago, into a bit of a disadvantage in an industrialized world over-populated with people and, ironically, with too much of the wrong kind of food. Overpopulation and the need to feed so many mouths has led to the industrialization of food production, transforming small family farms into large monocultures of genetically-modified cornfields and acre-sized metal sheds of captive, steroid and antibiotic-injected cows. We might have once thought this scaling up of food production to be a good thing, but is it?<br /><br />But why stop asking questions there? Just where does that McDonald's meal come from, really? Why does the U.S. grow so much corn? Why do the factory farms plant thousands of acres of corn, and only corn? And with so much corn, why does the government subsidize the factory farms to grow more of it? Is \\"corn-fed beef\\" a delicacy, or a perorative? How is Whole Foods, at the same time, different from and just like the modern factory farm? Why might Joel Salatin's Polyface Farm, in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, represent the best farm in the U.S.?<br /><br />Why indeed. And you might be surprised at the answers to each of the above questions.<br /><br />So if you have ever wondered about the food you unpackage from its plastic shrink wrap and plop into the microwave, if you have ever considered the moral hazard of eating meat - or corn, and if you have ever wanted to gather wild mushrooms, then you might want to read The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals by Michael Pollan.<br /><br />With an admirable investigative tenacity and a gift for telling a good story, Michael details how our food is grown, produced, cooked, and eaten by examining the life story behind four meals - one bought from a fast food chain, one made from items bought in an organic store, one made from foods grown and raised on a sustainable farm, and one made from foods foraged from the wild. In reading about Michael's adventures, you will discover what it takes to get the food on your table to your table, and you will likely never think about corn the same again.<br /><br />Modern humans have lost the connection to the land and the food it provides. Overweight, overpopulated, and increasingly unhealthy, Michael's look into what we eat and how it was made is perhaps the just desserts.<br /><br />(review by Kendall Giles)g meat - or corn, and if you have ever wanted to gather wild mushrooms, then you might want to read The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals by Michael Pollan.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|I bought all three of the Lord of the Rings Complete Recordings and loaded them onto my iPod so I can listen to them while I go for my walks.  I marked the titles LOTR A1-3 Fellowship of the Rings; LOTR B1-3 Two Towers; LOTR C1-4 Return of the King and made sure Howard Shore was the artist for all of the songs so I could listen to them in order.  It is really fun to listen and think about what part in the movies that music goes with.      The quality of this music is superb, with a lot of feeling and variety that makes it great to really enjoy to its fullest.  It sounds even better on a full stereo system!  If you loved the movies, and if you love music, this is an excellent set to own.
B001PPGAIK|3.0|This is one of the type of films that people are going to either absolutely love or pretty much hate on.  That said, if you are reading this review, you'll have found that I rated the film a middle of the road 3 (out of 5) stars.  Why did I wind up there? Because the first 20 minutes just about completely lost my interest in seeing the rest of the film (along with my wife, who was also of the opinion we should just shut the Blu-ray off or toss in a definite comedy instead).<br /><br />It took two nights to get through the complete film.  After watching approximately half of the film, I was left wondering what the people that liked the movie were watching that seems so different than what I've found in watching that first half of the film.  Somewhere in that 90 minutes was what could be a decent film, if the director had decided whether he wanted a comedy, or a drama, or a mystery/thriller.<br /><br />Instead, it seems that in trying not to be too predictable, and also perhaps in trying to make an epic, the result is, at least throughout that first half of the film, and in several places in the second half too, an overly long film that takes too long getting to the point and telling the story.<br /><br />Just in that first 90 minutes there was at least 15 - 20 minutes that could have just been left on the cutting room floor and/or never been filmed at all. If it had to be filmed and kept in the story, then certainly much of the material could have been conveyed more efficiently without really changing the meat of the story.<br /><br />Not being quick to give up, my wife and I watched the second half of the film a night after watching the first half.  The second 90 minutes seems to stay more focused than the first and as a result seems to be less disjointed.  Perhaps it's more predictable, but it just seems better and less comical (and no, I don't mean comical as in it was trying to be humorous and came off that way, I mean comical as in nearly laughable and barely tolerable).<br /><br />For anyone considering purchase, I really recommend saving your money and going the rental route instead.  Go with Un-box and save your purchase money for something else.  Australia (the film) may look very nice (the picture quality on the Blu-ray disc is very nice), but it may just about lost you (as it nearly did with me) within the first 10 - 15 minutes on seeming to be just plain stupid. Minus that material, it's not as bad, but still takes a long time to get there and then leaves you thinking that the movie is too long and trying too hard when it didn't need to.<br /><br />Having finally seen the complete film, it doesn't surprise me at all that the movie didn't get much love in theatres and was raked over the coals somewhat by many reviewers.ing purchase, I really recommend saving your money and going the rental route instead.

B001PPGAIK|5.0|One of the reviews for this movie was titled \\"Who says they don't make em like they used to?\\"  Right on.  This is a wonderfully produced movie.  It has almost everything.  Excellent acting, panaramic scenery, action, societal politics, storyline, and \\"old fashioned\\" romance.  In a way this movie combines a \\"Gone with the Wind\\" feeling with the more visceral scenescapes of \\"Quigley Down Under.\\"  It is an interesting story that has Jackman and Kidman playing their roles magnificently.  I recommend that Amazon viewers at the very minimum, at least rent this movie.  I do not think they will be disappointed.  My wife and I certainly were not.

B001TH16DI|1.0|Paramount is the worst.  This release is just a thrown together bunch of crap to collect money from trekkers.  Face it fellow Federation Members until we unite and stop buying these travesties they will keep rolling merrily along picking our pockets as long as they can.

0393324818|4.0|Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game is a 2003 baseball book by Michael Lewis about the Oakland Athletics and general manager Billy Beane. Conventional baseball wisdom is flawed, Lewis says, and many coaches and scouts focus on the wrong statistics. The Oakland A's, because of severe budget restrictions, sought to find objective ways (like sabermetrics) to evaluate players. In doing so, the A's were able to find players who were undervalued in the market, which led to a very successful run with a relatively low payroll in the early 2000's.<br /><br />Lewis also explores the life and career of Beane, who was a very talented baseball prospect who never panned out as a player because of confidence issues. Lewis also includes lengthy sections on Bill James, the founder of sabermetrics, catcher/first baseman Scott Hatteberg, and pitcher Chad Bradford. Lewis follows, loosely, the A's' 2002 season.<br /><br />Objectively, on-base percentage is typically considered the most important single statistic. The A's strategy, though, goes beyond finding high-OBP players - they want any player with any quality that the market undervalues (this also explains why they haven't been very good in recent years and why they don't have many good OBP guys).<br /><br />One of Lewis's themes is how resistant Major League Baseball has been to Beane's ideas - they took several years to catch on, and there are still many who oppose them. Several of Beane's underlings (and other Beane disciples) have become general managers recently, but there is still an appalling ignorance among commentators (which is hardly surprising), coaches, and scouts.<br /><br />Lewis, as in his other works, tends to ramble from time to time (he also likes to throw in the big word seemingly for its own sake). Many sections are longer than they need to be, and become tedious; others are marginally interesting but have little to do with his topics. But Lewis also does a good job portraying the personalities of his characters, and as such Moneyball is immersive.<br /><br />Moneyball is important to the history of baseball - it, more than anything else, brought objective statistical analysis of baseball players into the mainstream. Any fan of baseball should find this interesting.neyball is immersive.

B001NY4X46|5.0|Primal Fear is a classic example of a talented actor transcending his role, turning a character into something special and memorable. What was originally marketed as a vehicle for Richard Gere became a breakout role for then-up-and-coming Edward Norton, who would go on to earn an Academy Award nomination for his performance and all kinds of critical praise.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Gregory Hoblit, writer Ann Biderman, producer Gary Lucchesi, executive producer Hawk Koch, and casting director Deborah Aquila. Hoblit says that there was surprisingly little studio interference and that he hasn't enjoyed that kind of freedom since. Everyone talks about how the studio didn't want Laura Linney or Edward Norton cast because they were unknowns at the time and it wanted proven movie stars in those roles. They had seen over 2,000 actors for Norton's role and the studio wanted Leonardo DiCaprio but he passed. Norton screen-tested and the rest is history.<br /><br />\\"Primal Fear: The Final Verdict\\" is a retrospective featurette that includes key cast and crew members reminiscing about the film. There is some definite overlap from the commentary however Linney and Norton contribute brand new interviews, speaking affectionately about the film.<br /><br />\\"Primal Fear: Star Witness\\" takes a look at the casting of Norton. The filmmakers did an extensive casting search. Norton remembers that a fellow actor told him about the role and he read for it. We are taken through the casting process with Norton offering his impressions.<br /><br />\\"Psychology of Guilt\\" examines the insanity defense and its success rate in court. Experts talk about how rare the multiple personality disorder is and how difficult it is to pull off. They take a look at several high profile examples were it was successful and where it failed.<br /><br />Finally, there is the original theatrical trailer.

They could include no extras and the fans would buy it.  And when Paramount comes out with a better version, they will buy that too.  And with the special edition packaging and they'll buy that.  It is useless to complain when you know there are too many who have plenty of dollars and no darn sense who will buy it no matter what the quality.  We just have to be patient.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I had an opportunity to see this film when it first premiered in Los Angeles.  All around, it was a return to the days of great story telling.  It differed from your typical Sport Heroe movies.  The demise of the man and the impulsion of the character (the wrestler) are enriched with a heavy dosage of realism.  The admission of defeat in one arena to seek a triumphant revival/farewell to a better place is absolutely amazing.  Few films have talked to me like this one does.

B00005JPY2|5.0|*SPOILER WARNING*<br /><br />Let me be blunt.<br /><br />Alan Moore should eat crow and be proud of this movie. \\"Unfilmable\\" it most certainly wasn't.<br /><br />And the fanboys all need to take a laxative. This was in at least some ways better than the maxi-series/graphic novel, which will never be demoted from its status as a classic of its medium.<br /><br />Aside from the overly graphic violence, a gratuituous sex scene, and Dr. Manhattan's needless nudity (he needed to wear pants, and seeing his genitalia added nothing to the plot)I really have nothing negative to say about Watchmen.<br /><br />Let's diffuse some of the criticisms I've come across.<br /><br />Yes, Matthew Goode was foppish as Ozymandias. He's supposed to be that way. He's not intended to exude menace. That's his style. A villian as sublime as Ozymandias is subtle. Coming across as overtly malevolent would have caused his plans to fail. His slender, Aryan appearance and slight German accent made him the perfect choice to play the type of foe who believes that the murder of millions is the only way to save the world.<br /><br />Which brings me to the casting. There was not one actor who didn't fit their respective character like Rorschach's inkblot mask. The decisions made concerning who should play who were more accurate than any comic book movie I can think of.<br /><br />Jeffrey Dean Morgan's Comedian was Burt Reynolds as a misogynist sociopath. It was as if the character himself was directly lifted from the pages of the graphic novel and given life. It was uncanny how Morgan captured this character's all too easy violence, his nonchalant, happy penchant for brutality.<br /><br />I said in a review of Batman:The Dark Knight that Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was unfathomably good, especially considering Ledger's teen idol pedigree.<br /><br />Jackie Earle Haley's Rorschach dethrones Ledger's Joker in that regard. From out of some forgotten void, a former heart throb returns to play a madman akin to Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle or Michael Douglas' William Foster. My money would be on Haley's Rorschach as Steve Ditko's right-wing Objectivist Mr. A, the analogue for Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' character, is channeled with such a chilling and disturbed beauty. His guilt is blended with an intolerance as he claims that the dead heroine Silhouette met her fate due to being a lesbian. When Haley takes off the mask, things become even more unnverving as you see how \\"fascinatingly ugly\\" Walter Kovacs, Rorschach's alter ego is, inside and out. Again, having a former Tiger Beat hero play such a character was just remarkable to me. 20 years from now, people will never believe that Haley was once a Bad News Bear, and for that alone he deserves an Oscar. Seriously. His performance is more than enough to recommend this film to anyone.<br /><br />None of the other performances disappoint. Patrick Wilson's Nite Owl also deserves mention as he nails down the David Brinkley (from Robert Mayer's obscure but very influential 1977 novel 'Superfolks') as Batman that Moore and Gibbons intended Nite Owl to be. He's awkward, stuffy, insecure, and rusty in crimefighting and life in general, and Wilson flawlessly gets that across.<br /><br />As an aside, and us comics fans need to face this fact, the film versions of Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, and Ozymandias absolutely trump the comics versions in terms of design. Silk Spectre is sexier, Nite Owl is fierce, sleek, and punches his wonky-looking comics counterpart back to DC's Silver Age, and here Ozymandias is a Greek god compared to Gibbons' take.<br /><br />Some people are complaining that Malin Akerman's Silk Spectre was dry, but I thought she was fine. In fact, she was just the right mixture of innocent and sultry and thusly kept with the spirit of not only Silk Spectre herself but also of the characters that inspired Moore and Gibbons to create her. Akerman was one mod version of Phantom Lady or Nightshade.<br /><br />Remember, they're all analogues because if they weren't, we wouldn't have had any Blue Beetle or Question tales in the 80's.<br /><br />Carla Gugino is quite the aging diva here. Her makeup job as a senior (The Silk Spectre's mother and predecessor) is so astonishing you'd think she was an unknown. In the flashback sequences she is the epitome of retro eroticism.<br /><br />She sees herself in an underground porn comic and is flattered. Wow.<br /><br />And speaking of unknowns, can anyone honestly think of any famous actors who would have done as well or better in these roles? Yet another reason why Watchmen is such a success. John Cusack as Nite Owl? Please.<br /><br />So the casting was faithful as was the entire movie for the most part, thereby squashing another gripe the fans had. I'll even go as far as to say that Watchmen works so well because it is very faithful to its source material.<br /><br />Yes, the ending is somewhat different, yet is pretty much the same. Ozymandias stages nuclear attacks instead of an alien invasion to unite mankind, \\"killing millions to save billions\\" as he himself would put it.<br /><br />You know, when I read the Watchmen chapter in David Hughes' book \\"The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made,\\" and saw that Sam Hamm didn't feel that the ending of the original comics story \\"worked\\" for him, I knew then and there that the makers of Watchmen the film weren't going to completely stick to Moore and Gibbons' vision. And that slight difference (it's just a parallel path to the same destination) only made for a better movie.<br /><br />Alien invasions are not timely in any period, let alone this alternate Nixon-led 1985 or 2009. The threat of mutually assured nuclear holocaust is. If humanity is to be dealt a serious blow, it will be by humanity's own hand, not something from beyond our solar system.<br /><br />What we have with the cinematic Watchmen, is what I believe we had with the original tale. It's a treatise on those who rule the world, masked as a superhero yarn, which in turn is masked as a murder mystery. It makes you think, and at the same time is mindful of that needed sense of wonder. It's scary, nihilistic, exciting, provocative, and its ending is as hopeful as it is troubling.<br /><br />The tale of the Watchmen is like a railroad track that is built with the best of aims yet leads to nowhere but perdition. What will our elites do, or what are they above or not above doing to improve the human condition? Who in power can we trust? In the movie, we see Nixon, Kissinger, and other real-life malefactors who did what they did for personal gain. What of Ozymandias? What did he stand to gain? Did he really love humankind or have nothing but detached contempt for it? We see this with Billy Crudup's Dr. Manhattan as well, although Manhattan suffers from disappointment and heartbroken selfishness, whereas Ozymandias has this sense of birthright to save the world from itself by way of genocide.<br /><br />I may need to dig out my copy of Watchmen the graphic novel as it has admittedly been a few years since I last perused it, but as a comics fan of 30 years, as someone who holds comics in the highest regard as an artform and recognizes the Moore/Gibbons masterwork as deserving of its status, I will state that Watchmen was more than worth the wait. One could even make a case that it's a better movie because it took so long to happen, that development hell aided in making it what it is.<br /><br />And it bears repeating, Watchmen, with some minor and essential tweaking, is reverent of the comic book, and that reverence is another component that makes the movie so engrossing.<br /><br />There was a time when I didn't think that a Watchmen film should be made. However, upon seeing the final product, I am left with some questions.<br /><br />Why isn't Alan Moore rejoicing?<br /><br />And why isn't comics fandom rejoicing along with him?<br /><br />Even if you've never read a comic book in your life, I strongly recommend Watchmen. If it doesn't make you a fan of the comic book or of comics in general, then you didn't enjoy the film, and if you didn't enjoy the film, I have nothing left to say to you. If you think that your unfamiliarity with the characters, the fact that they aren't icons like Batman and Spider-Man, will hinder your enjoyment, remind yourself of the Hellboy phenomenon. Hellboy was a mid-level character that has never had an ongoing series and was published by a company that was not Marvel or DC. He has since been the subject of a pair of moviehouse blockbusters. Also be mindful of the the popular Men In Black franchise and its origin as an obscure independent comic book. From the looks of it, the heroes/villians (are they one and the same?) of Watchmen are about to join that club.<br /><br />If you are a comics fan and haven't seen it yet, leave the nitpicker in you at home, allow yourself to be surprised in the best way possible, and go ahead and be a little smug as the closing credits roll. You deserve it for being so far ahead of the curve.<br /><br />A monument of comics finally has a cinematic counterpart. Hold your head high..

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|Terminator is a classic sci-fi movie. The blu-ray version does the best it can with the very old special effects. Special feature about creating some of those effects was interesting.
B001N44BW0|4.0|[[ASIN:B001N44BW0 Body of Lies (Full-Screen Edition)]]  This is an unflinching look at the undercover work by Leonardo DiCaprio's character in the Middle East during the Iraq war.  Leo once again shows he is an incredible actor and one that seems to be overlooked.  Though the movie follows DiCaprio's character throughout the Middle East in search of a certain Al Qaeda leader which eventually leads to a violent meeting between the two in an \\"undisclosed\\" area there is also a side story for his character.  This side story involves a possible love interest and if he reeally wants to continue working for the CIA.<br />  The movie is slow moving at times but you're always watching the screen because of Leo.  You also get to see Russell Crowe shine once again, although his character may not be the most well-liked character as Leonardo's CIA boss.<br />  I recommend this movie.  It's not the typical Hollywood film that tends to become preachy.  As Russell Crowe's voice-over at the beginning of the film states, \\"The question of should we be there or not is irrelevant.  The fact is, we're there now and how do we get out?\\"  That's as preachy as the film gets.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only new about this series after watching the movie \\"Serenity\\". During the movie I began to guess this had come from a TV series, but I didn't get to watch the episodes until some time later.    After viewing this futuristic world, with characters that might be described as space cowboys, I was disappointed that someone had canceled this show too early. There is a good mix of action and comedy. The characters live on the fringes of space, separating themselves from the heavy arm of the government, while making a living dodging space-mad reavers. Their ship is a nomadic home among the few planets they can find, hopping between settlements full of other not-so-lawful folks trying to get some breathing space from the law.    I would recommend this series to any sci-fi fan.

B001K98MFK|5.0|By now everyone knows how terrible a job Dreamworks did with the first release of this movie. No need to beat that dead horse. Hopefully, Oshii fans who shelled out the hard earned money for the inferior DreamWorks copy won't groan too much for buying the Bandai re-release of this masterpiece. It's worth it. For one, there's an English Dub: which is both good news and bad. The good news is that you can now watch the entire movie without having to oscillate between subtitles and the amazing visuals. And the visuals are amazing. The bad news is that, like all of Oshii's movies, the original Japanese is always better than the English dub. Oshii elicits a more subdued tone from his actors than the English counter-parts. Having said that, the English re-acting is about as good as it will get. But there are some sacrifices that had to be made. A lot of the original text, specifically the quotes that Oshii employed, are paraphrased. Sometimes the re-wording works. But other times it doesn't. For instance, a great deal of the text by the forensics scientist \\"Haraway\\" is unnecessarily altered. Not sure why they did that, but they did.    But beggars can't be choosers, and all in all Bandai has done great justice in the re-packaging of this film. My hope is that they are the distributors in all of Oshii's future releases so that we don't have to waste time and money on US distributors butchering his work.

0765342294|1.0|What did I hate most about Ender's Game? 1) The non-stop imagery of naked boys running around, grappling with one another, getting soapy and fighting in the showers, etc. 2) The militarist, \\"destroy your enemies completely when you have the chance\\" themes that were reinforced over and over; 3) The glorification of a centralized fascist state, whose central-planning eugenics program produces a race of super children that act like adults (without the annoying pubic hair) except they have no personality whatsoever (not the author's intent); 4) The implausibility of the plot; 5) The lack of skill with which the book is written, shifting from first to third person in the same paragraph with no indication who's speaking or thinking; 6) The incestuous relationship between Ender and his sister; 7) The apologia for Hitler and the Holocaust via the \\"innocent\\" Genocide Ender commits; 8) The mind-numbingly boring and endless scenes that take place entirely inside a video game, or worse yet, in the appallingly lame \\"Battle Room;\\" 9) The Antisemitism.<br /><br />Which is it? #10) All of the above.<br /><br />This is, without question, the worst book I've ever read.

Time and time again, we're told how the boys are naked \\"-- skin from head to toe.\\" The boys \\"strip\\" or \\"peel off\\" their clothes; undress \\"methodically.\\" We're treated to meticulous descriptions of soap running over their prepubescent bodies in the shower, or their cheeks (which ones?) turning red with shame as they're made to march naked through the halls. These boys, even with hairs on their chins, don't even notice the difference between themselves and the one token girl at the Battle School, who also runs around naked. And of course, there's the infamous shower-fight scene, wherein another boy gets \\"naked and wet\\" to fight Ender, just so things are even. Ender beats him to death, with the coup d'grace a \\"hard and sure\\" kick to his opponent's naked crotch.<br /><br />If you like this book, you are either an idiot or a pervert or both -- to say nothing of being a fascist. I could go on and on about the generally fascist and explicitly Nazi imagery in Ender's Game, but why bother? The arrested-development fans of this trash, still living at home with mom and having never read a legitimate book their entire lives, are completely unable to see the even more obvious man-boy love imagery, why go into detail about the more subtle (but still overt) homages to something they're only tacitly familiar with (i.e., real world political philosophy and history) anyway?<br /><br />A friend recommended this book to me.

B001N44BVQ|3.0|I rented this film and was instantly hooked in. I could care less who stars, as the characters and story are what I truly look for. Ridley Scott does best what he's been doing the past couple of years, releasing okay movies. Yes, I though American Gangster and A Good Year were okay. I can never put Leo DiCaprio as an action star. No matter how much muscle he packs on, the guy still looks like he is in his early 20's. Russell Crowe plays Leo's lazy American boss who spends most of the time calling Leo his \\"buddy\\" and stuffing his face with food while showing no attention at all to his 2 small children. The action scenes were definately on par, but I am kinda finding the whole War in the Middle East back drop a bit tiring. Can they go somewhere else? What about fighting terrorists on the home front? There are way more dangerous people here than in the Middle East. Which is shown quite alot through this film. Overall, a pretty good film, could of been better.

B00005JLCI|5.0|Kenneth Branagh's \\"Hamlet\\" captures the inner turmoil of one of literature's most enigmatic characters.  This 242 minute long movie carefully leaves no stone unturned.  The setting, filmed on location,transports the audience into Hamlet's opulent and extravagant Danish palace where Claudius and Gertrude hold high court amidst their colorful machinations and remorseless pleasures.  A star studded cast delivers blank verse rather expertly, but the greatest performance is given by Kate Winslet whose Ophelia always gets the audience's attention.  Winslet leaves the audience breathless at the end of the Act IV \\"mad\\" scene when she bids Laertes \\"Good-bye, you\\" before turning her back to a cruel and heartless world.  Branagh's Hamlet nails the soliloquies with expert preciseness and depth of emotion.  The comic relief provided by Billy Crystal as the Gravedigger and Robin Williams as Osric is most welcome after four acts of heart wrenching emotion, guilt, treachery, and murder.  Branaugh does not shorten the plot and remains true to Shakespeare's original drama.  If you have four hours to devote to a classic masterpiece, I would definitely recommend Kenneth Branagh's \\"Hamlet\\".

0618918248|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much, and I will say it helped move me from a middle-of-the-road agnostic to a sure-enough-for-all-practical-purposes atheist.  I found the latter part of the book, focusing on morality and the supposed gaps in our minds that god concepts fill, to be the most compelling.  Dawkins presents reasoned hypotheses about the evolutionary origin of morality and well formed rhetorical arguments for why science and reason can provide as much or more inspiration and consolation than any tired dogma.    I couldn't quite go to five stars for two reasons.  First, in what could be called the key chapter of the book, I feel that Prof. Dawkins did not convey a particular idea very well: that of the Anthropic principle.  I followed along quite well with the rest of his points in Chapter 4, but that particular item was difficult and I had to go to outside sources to clarify it.  I think he could have done better considering how well he explains things in the rest of the book.  The second point is one that appears to be missing.  The book description on the back cover claims the author will address why pure agnosticism (\\"I don't know one way or the other and that's all I will say\\") is not really a tenable position, but looking back I don't think it was addressed as a specific point.  He spoke about it often in the early part of the book, in larger contexts he was developing, but I expected a specific refutation of pure agnosticism to show up somewhere.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Words can't express the disgust with which I heard this movie was being made, for why remake a perfect show?  I know everyone says that, but I was really feeling it in the case of THE PARENT TRAP.  I don't even know who directed the original, but to me, I wouldn't care if Ewe Boll decided to remake 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, VERTIGO, or THE SEARCHERS, but leave THE PARENT TRAP alone!  And so I existed, in a cold vacuum of contempt, for ten years or more until, accidentally changing the channel, I saw a little red head girl who looked strangely familiar.  I clapped my hands and my wife came into the room, took a look, and commented, \\"Oh, is that Druggie when she was a child?\\"<br /><br />\\"Druggie?\\"<br /><br />I didn't recognize the girl, and then it hit me that it was Lindsay Lohan.  Wow, what a plain little thing, but then I remember Hayley Mills was not exactly a Jon Benet type either.  Anyhow I was hooked when I saw there were two of Lindsay, and from then on I figured out it was the hated PARENT TRAP remake.  My verdict?  She is a fantastic little actress and full of original, fresh ideas.  Dennis Quaid?  Much better than Brian Keith!  What's her name Redgrave who plays the mother?  Not as good as Maureen O'Hara, why even try, should have gone in another direction.  The servants?  Horrible little storyline--sorry servant fans.  I'd give it five stars except for two things,<br /><br />Why not have the two Lindsays sing \\"Let's Get Together\\"?  I have all of Lindsay's records and I'm here to tell you, that girl can sing (with studio help of course).  All through the movie I was feeling anxiety about how on earth they were going to top the two Hayley's singing the number at the dinner they had planned to bring their parents together.  Well, Lindsay and Lindsay put on the dinner, but never brought out the ukelele or whatever.  Lindsay sings a smidgin of the tune while waiting for the elevator, and Alan Silvestri's score manages to quote the familiar refrain once or twice, but it is not the same!  Waiting that long for something that never comes, is like, well, I can't say what it is like, not in a review of a family film!<br /><br />Secondly, they still have never explained why Dennis Quaid and Redgrave designer woman ever split up and each took one of the twins and then never told either one!  It seems so cruel and horrible.  You'd think Family Services would step in, and take both kids away from each selfish parent, and give them to a needy family who would care for them both equally.

1400082773|5.0|Would I have read this book had its author not been elected President of the United States? Probably not, but I would have missed a book worth reading.<br />The miracle of Obama's election last November only grows after reading this account of his childhood, youth and young manhood. We learn how he was born, the result of a romance between his Kenyan father and young American mother; how his father returns to Africa, his mother remarries an Indonesian man and his years in that country. Returning to Hawaii, the young Obama goes through years of confusion about his identity and the meaning of his blackness. He becomes a community organizer in Chicago (these chapters provide the most vivid writing) and visits his late father's family in Kenya.<br />One is struck by the fact that this young man has graduated from the University of Life as well as Harvard Law School. He knows firsthand about poverty and the problems of our innercities. He knows how so many young black men have fallen victim to hopelessness and the streets. He knows from direct experience how hard it is to make progress, to fight the dead weight of poverty.<br />One thing I miss in this book is the birth of Obama's ambition. He presents himself as a young drifter engaged in an intellectual search for identity but he must have been much more than that. What impelled him to grab the chance to transfer to Columbia University? We're not precisely told. What prompted him to go to Harvard law. Again, it's left a bit opaque.<br />Another quibble: we get too much for my liking about the elder Obama, the absent father, and not enough about his mother who stuck around to raise him. We learn about Dr. Obama's blighted career, his many infidelities, his bewildering set of offspring with various women, his drinking, his reckless generosity and on and on. Also a little too much about the mythic origins of the Obama clan deep in African prehistory.<br />If Obama is the product of an African father and a white mother, it is the absent father who looms much the larger in his imagination. The white side of his family -- his long-suffering mother and the grandparents who helped raise him -- get short shrift. We hear about Obama's grandfather's attitude to race and black. He too is a disappointed man who failed to live up to his own expectations of himself. Yet, he helped produce Obama.<br />It's fascinating to me how an absent parent can loom larger in a young man's mind than the one who stuck around and did the hard day-to-day job of raising the child.<br />The writing is admirably clear and for the most part the book is consistently interesting. I think we are blessed by having such a self-aware and knowledgeable man as our president. This is far more than the usual campaign-biography, produced with a ghost writer to present the candidate or potential candidate in the best possible light. This is a real book about a real person. That's the highest praise I can offer.r who looms much the larger in his imagination.

The writing is admirably clear and for the most part the book is consistently interesting. I think we are blessed by having such a self-aware and knowledgeable man as our president. This is far more than the usual campaign-biography, produced with a ghost writer to present the candidate or potential candidate in the best possible light. This is a real book about a real person. That's the highest praise I can offer.
B001N3OCV6|3.0|Kinda disappointed here...  Where is 99 red balloons by Nena?? Where is Everybody wants to rule the world by Tears for fears??   Even though it was not in the movie it would be great if they added The Beginning is the End is the Beginning By Smashing pumpkins.
0307276902|4.0|A million little pieces was an interesting book, it was definitely like nothing else I have read. It was about James Frey and how he overcomes his addiction. Drugs and Alcohol have always been in his life from the age of ten. The memories he recalled during the book dealt with at least one if not both. The book starts out when he is twenty three and his body is ready to quit on him, that is when he goes to rehab and gives life a chance. He takes fool responsibility for what his life has become. Along with refusing to blame his family or genetics, he refuses to believe in a higher power which the AA requires. James goes into detail about the dentistry work he had done and being sick a little farther then I would of like. But I really liked the book. It is of a rebellion character that overcomes a major addiction and comes out a better man in many ways. He learns to let people in and that he is strong. I liked the book although I thought it got a little long at parts going into detail about the dental work and getting sick. I know there has been a big controversy over how James lied and the book is actually fiction, but the story would not have been as gripping without the exaggerations. I was crazy about the style it was written in but I didn't mind it either, it fit the story. The book was quite good, but I thought it was clearly fiction. So I recommend this book as just another fiction read without thinking of it as a big lie.
0790736926|5.0|It is 1868 in Texas. The Civil War is over but Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) continues to identify as a Confederate. He visits his family after a long time away, and is greeted by his niece Debbie. Soon thereafter, the family is massacred by the Comanches, and Debbie is kidnapped and raised as a Comanche. [It must be remembered that the kidnapping and upbringing of foreign children was practiced not only by certain Indian tribes, but also by many different peoples, and not only in the distant past. For instance, during WWII, Germans under Nazism kidnapped thousands of \\"racially desirable\\" Polish children and raised them as Germans.]<br /><br />The challenges of finding Debbie are formidable. Who even knows if she is alive? Considering the many different tribal groups that relocate on a regular basis, how is \\"Uncle Ethan\\" to locate her? Ethical issues sometimes come up in the film. The Reverend, for instance, opposes the continued shooting at attacking Indians once they have started to retreat.<br /><br />In time, Edwards finds out that Chief Scarface has his niece. But how to approach him without endangering Debbie's life?  The plot continues to build. In time, Edwards arranges a meeting with Chief Scarface. He is shown a belt of scalps, including those of his murdered relatives. He sees the now-teenaged Debbie, but she now considers the Comanches as \\"her people\\". Debbie's brother wants a violent assault on the Indian camp. Can Debbie be rescued alive, and, if so, can her sense of belonging to Ethan Edward's family be resurrected?
0307455874|4.0|This book is more of a journal that he has kept during his efforts to become the senator. These are accounts of his earnest and honest efforts. Not all chapters are interesting. He could have kept some topics concise. He will have more books on the way, now that he is the President.
B000025JMP|5.0|This is a soundtrack to the documentary \\"Elvis That's the Way It Is.\\" The album was a modest hit when it was released in 1970 peaking at 21 on the US album chart (number 8 on the US Country chart) and 12 in the UK. It would be certified GOLD by the RIAA. The documentary covered Elvis' concerts in Las Vegas. It includes both live recordings from the show and \\"studio rehearsal\\" recordings. It includes the US hit single \\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\\" and the UK hit single \\"I Just Can't Help Believin'\\". While it is a little lite on the number of songs included (it is just a reissue of the LP) it is still an excellent collection and a must for Elvis fans. Elvis is in top form for these recordings.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Back in grade school, one of our teachers showed us the actual German newsreels from the concentration camps. We saw mounds of glasses, gold tooth fillings, shoes. Prisoners dug mass graves they'd probably be buried in and smokestacks burned black above the concentration camps, all in stark black and white. I'll never forget those films.    I haven't seen \\"Schindler's List\\" until now and that was because I was told this was one of the 'must see' films of the 20th century. I'd agree with that assessment.     The essential story is that of Oskar Schindler, a German businessman and war profiteer who originally saw World War II as an opportunity and the Jews as a likely source of funding for his crockery factory.  As the movie progresses, Schindler's character changes. He's one of the most fascinating and unlikely heroes you'll ever encounter.     What strikes me is the similarity between those newsreels and \\"Schindler.\\" Steven Spielberg kept it real and the impact is just as jarring.      This is a movie you should see if you pride yourself in being a cinema buff. It's a long watch, but a worthwhile one.    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009

B0018AVNKC|5.0|It's hard being the new kid in town.  Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) has just moved to Oregon with her parents, who didn't tell the landlady of their 150-year-old home they had a kid.     Of course, they could have forgotten. The pair are writers and totally immersed in a garden catalogue though neither of them like dirt.     Coraline is quickly bored and lonely. Her neighbors are a crazy old Russian man with a trained mouse circus and a pair of old actresses.     When she discovers a bricked over door, she's set to go exploring.  What she finds is an alternate world which at first seems a good deal better. Meals are delicious, her button-eyed Mom and Dad seem to be a lot more attentive, and even Wybie, the pesky neighbor kid, has his mouth sewn shut.    Perfect, but the cost of living in this world is dear and one she may not want to pay.    Director and screenwriter Henry Selick has proven his mettle with the stop-motion animation classic \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas.\\" If anything, \\"Coraline's\\" graphics are even better.  The sound and voicing are also quite good.      I don't recommend the show for very young kids unless they are not easily scared, but for anyone over the age 8 or so with a very bent sense of humor, you're going to love Coraline.    Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I have high praise for Blackholes and Revelations but I've been witness to their greater productions making it easy to cast some of these songs aside. This is a VERY good listen, but what some people overlook is that it has it's highs AND it's lows. To be quite honest if I judged this album like most everyone else, rating my opinion on an entire album only based on the four or five songs that I liked then I'd definitely give this five stars like the majority also. But I rate the album as a whole; and quite frankly tracks 5-10 don't interest me like it's predecessors (that's half of the album!). On the other hand the tracks that do stand out are so incredible I think they are worthy to address as \\"post Absolution recordings\\". On that note after first listening to Absolution, a few years ago, I was under the impression that Muse had nowhere to go but down after producing such an outstanding album. However after listening to songs like 'Take a Bow' and 'Map Of The Problematique' I've never been so pleased to be mistaken. Muse does an exceptional job with this album trying to overcome the shadow of their previous masterpiece.<br /><br />In the long run this album will surmount to as much of a jewel as 'Showbiz' or 'Origins of Symmetry' or 'Hullabaloo' -all fantastic but not as much of a monument as Absolution. If you're going to buy a Muse album I would still absolutely recommend Absolution. Unlike Blackholes and Revelations there are no track(s) worth skipping.<br /><br />[On a side note I'd like to mention that I'm an avid concert goer and immediately after this album was released I saw these guys live and they conducted the best show I've ever seen (and I've seen around 100 concerts). If you get a chance to catch these guys in concert it will without fail fuel your admiration for Muse. Definitely put these guys at the top of your \\"bands to see live\\" list. If you need proof check out the live dvd that comes with their Haarp compilation.]<br />Cheers
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never been so productive in 20 minutes in my entire life.  This DVD is the only accessory you need (and a mat and weights) to be on your way to a great body.  Jillian kicks your butt in 20 minutes.  Just when you think you can't do another second, she changes the move and you can continue.  This is hands down the best exercise DVD in my library and I have a lot.
B000UBMWG4|1.0|Agree with another reviewer on this. The so-called Final Cut version on disc 1 is only the Workprint version. Key point is that although the packaging says that the Final Cut has TrueHD and also French 5.1DD, these do not even show up in the menu as options on the Final Cut disc. Have compared the 2 discs and they are identical, even down to the running time. Wondered why the quality of the picture seemed worse than my copy of the Final Cut version on DVD.

0312383320|5.0|Okay, I admit I am an Stephanie Plum junkie.  This is a great between the numbers book.  How can anything that makes you laugh out loud be bad?  The only time I became disappointed was when I finished the book.  Can't wait until the next one.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Powerful, innocent and absolutely tragic!  `THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS' is simply an amazing film.<br /><br />The film focuses on a family of four focusing on the youngest, Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a naive young eight-year-old who loves playing \\"airplanes\\" with his friends.  But he learns that his father, a high ranking Nazi officer is being moved to a new area (to oversee a Jewish concentration camp) and thus it will be a start of a new life for Bruno and his family.<br /><br />For Bruno's father (played by David Thewlis), the man does his job for their thinking of a better world and thus massacring the Jews.  Bruno's grandfather (Richard Johnson) is supportive and proud of his dad but his grandmother (Sheila Hacock) feels shame for his son.  Of course, that is the first major secret the family has kept (any German who objects to the Nazi way of thinking would be incarcerated or would be branded a traitor).<br /><br />But the family begins their new life in their new home.  With armed guards and a Jewish slave/helper named Pavel, the family tries to get accustomed to their new surroundings.  Of course, Bruno is not to thrilled because he has no friends around him but outside his bedroom window, he sees a farm (actually, the concentration camp) and wonders why everyone is wearing striped pajamas.<br /><br />His mother (Vera Farmiga) is shocked that they have moved not far from a concentration camp.  She thought they would be many miles away not right near it.  Meanwhile, Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie) who was a young daughter at 12-years-old fascinated with dolls, suddenly becomes fascinated with the young Nazi soldier who is a driver for the family.<br /><br />But as much as his parents have told him to not look towards the \\"farm\\", Bruno runs off towards what he thinks is a farm and he sees a young boy sitting near the electric wired fence.  The boy is named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon).  Bruno is just happy to find someone young that he can play with but doesn't understand why he wears pajamas or can't play.  Shmuel is also naive himself.  He knows that he must follow the rules in the concentration camp but he sits in the corner behind a rock to be alone.<br /><br />The two become friends and Bruno eventually comes to visit him everyday with food and so he can play games or talk with him.<br /><br />Throughout the course of the film, we see Bruno, who doesn't fully understand the war and when he wants to read adventure books, his instructor teaches him about being proud to be Nazi and why he should despite the Jewish people.<br /><br />This is where Bruno is confused because the servant named Pavel seems like a nice guy, Shmuel seems like a nice guy but his teacher tells him that there are no good Jewish people and if he ever found one, he would be a great explorer.<br /><br />In the air outside the home, there is a putrid stench and sure enough Bruno's mother finds out from one of the soldiers that the smell is the cremation of Jewish people.  She is just in awe of how terrible they are being treated and thus leads to problems between her and her husband.  Her husband is doing his job but for Bruno's mother, she can't believe they are living near a concentration camp.<br /><br />In one scene, the family witnesses during dinner time, Pavel accidentally spills wine on the table and literally taken to another room and kicked to death.<br /><br />This pushes Bruno's mother even more to the edge now because  she has to witness the brutalization of Jewish people in her home.  Of course, Bruno is naive and not knowing what happened to Pavel.<br /><br />Next thing you know, Pavel is replaced by Shmuel.  Bruno is so happy to have his friend now at his home and his friend looks so hungry, Bruno gives him some food.  But unfortunately, a Nazi soldier catches them and when Bruno is yelled at and asked how the Jewish boy got the food, in fear, Bruno tells the soldier that Shmuel stole it and thus Shmuel is taken in for punishment.<br /><br />Because of his lie, Bruno knows he did something very bad and now his friend has gotten hurt.  But being a friend, Bruno wants to make it up to Shmuel.<br /><br />\\"THE BOY IN STRIPED PAJAMAS\\" deals with Bruno's naiveness but yet his friendship with Shmuel, his sister's transformation to a girl who liked to play with dolls to a loyal believer in Hitler and the Nazis but also seeing how his mother's conscience starts to eat her up and knowing what her husband is in charge of and that they are living near a death camp and seeing how the Jewish people are treated.<br /><br />\\"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMES\\" is powerful and moving film but very tragic.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />The film is presented in Widescreen (1:85:1), enhanced for 16×9 televisions.  Video quality on this DVD is pretty good as you do get a sense of color during the outdoor scenes and good lighting and set design as well.<br /><br />Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound with the film being primarily a dialogue film that comes clear on your front channel speakers.  Music is used to show emotion of a scene and is utilized quite well.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />There are three special features included on the DVD for \\"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS\\". Included are:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scenes (With Optional Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne) - About five deleted scenes with commentary.  Most of the cuts were made early in the film.<br />  * Friendship Beyond the Fence Featurette - A featurette featuring  interviews with the director and the cast of the film.  Comments on how talented Asa Butterfield was as a young actor and playing Bruno.  Each talked about their character and working with each other, asking Asa Butterfield (Bruno) and Jack Scanlon (Shmuel) about their knowledge of the Holocaust and even having to remake one of the Nazi propaganda films of Jewish enjoying the concentration camps which was used in the film.<br />  * Feature Commentary by Writer/Director Mark Herman and Author John Boyne - Both discuss the film and talk about the talent, the characters and differences between the film and the book.  Certain shots and the emotions that the director wanted to capture on screen.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I have to admit that with a Holocaust film involving children, I wasn't sure where this story was going.  But by the film's end and the final wide shot, I was just amazed by the film and yet saddened by how tragic the film ended.<br /><br />I was really moved by the film and the various performances. I was very amazed by Asa Butterfield's performance as Bruno and because he was naive and really didn't care about how the Nazi's felt about the Jews, he was able to have this friendship with Shmuel.  Jack Scanlon's Shmuel was also another performance that was well done and you had this sense of sadness in the child's eyes.<br /><br />Vera Farmiga's performance as his mother was well-done and seeing how she started out as this strong woman, good mother and proud wife of a high ranking Nazi officer but then seeing her evolve when she discovers the atrocities and having to live nearby and having to bare with death near her home and having to lie to her children of what is happening.<br /><br />But what was innocent for the most part of the film really shocks you at what happens at the end of the film.  I was shocked of how it ended and I'll just leave it at that.<br /><br />Very good costume and set design and really good cinematography by Benoit Delhomme.  The screenplay was well-written, emotions well captured on film and each talent did a great job in portraying their character.<br /><br />Everything was well done in this film.<br /><br />A powerful and moving film, \\"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS\\" is a film that deserves to watched.  It's not a film about the Holocaust with guns ablazing, it's a film that shows the cruelty of that time but focusing on an eight-year-old boy who knows not of what is going on around him, not knowing why the Nazi's hate the Jewish people but being optimistic that once the war is over, he and Shmuel can finally play together.  Naive to know that the \\"farm\\" where he thinks Shmuel and others are having fun in is actually a concentration camp where many people are being massacred. And it's the naivety of both children, not knowing how dangerous things are but knowing that their friendship is real that sets up the final part of the film.<br /><br />\\"THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS\\" is highly recommended!ween the film and the book.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing these exercises with Exercise TV.  I wanted to see if I could get a dvd so when I travel I can still do my exercises.  Jillian says that each segment is 20 minutes.  It is a real work out.  I gained 25 pounds after I quit smoking 11 months ago.  My regular walking and Tony Little gazelle, and WW was not getting it off.  I do the Jillian exercises six days a week and I can see the difference.  I will do it for 30 consecutive days and the go back to alternate days with this and the gazelle. I am 58 in reasonable health with some knee problems.  Jillian gives you to different ways to do  most of the high impact moves.  I do suggest that you invest in some good crossing training shoes.

B001N26GFC|5.0|Fun, bubbly and really enjoyable.  Sally Hawkins just owns this role!  A wonderful performance and a kind of movie that is just rare, wild and crazy fun!<br /><br />Director and writer Mike Leigh returns with \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" and with his cool and non-traditional approach in movie making, the film benefits from the talent just becoming as one with their character and the fact that the actors themselves didn't know what they were getting into, you get a unique style of film that may not have a major plot per se, but it's more of how one woman's attitude and behavior affects the people around her.<br /><br />The film is about Poppy (Sally Hawkins), her way of looking at life is rather bubbly, always happy, optimistic, cracking jokes with a tinge of perverted humor.  Rarely is she down in the dumps because of her cheery and happy attitude.  And because she emits this attitude, some may interpret it as freaky (because she keeps talking and cracking jokes) but for those who know her, there is a sense of comfort to have her near them.<br /><br />The main storyline is about the people that Poppy knows, some really well and some not well at all and how they react around her.<br /><br />Her best friend Zoe, who she has lived with for ten years, has a good friendship with Poppy and both are school teachers.  Zoe is a bit more of a realist but both managed to have fun in their single lives.<br /><br />Throughout the film, you see Poppy learn the Flamenco, go to a chiropractor for her aching back, trying to befriend a homeless man, trying to meet an employee at the bookstore, meeting up with family, trying to find out why a bully in class is beating up kids.  And each person she comes across, she gives them a dose of her personality.<br /><br />But she meets her challenge when she goes through driver's training and encounters a frumpy, closed-minded racist who happens to be her driver's instructor.  But for Poppy, what becomes a session of paying for driver's lessons, she looks at the opportunity to try to bring some sunshine to his life or at least get him to open up.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" is presented in Widescreen (2:35:1).  What I enjoyed about this film is that there are so many locations shot throughout London.  May it be shopping, going to a club, going out on a date, driving lessons, Flamenco lessons, etc.  So, you get a good does of color.<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound but the film is primarily a dialogue-based film.  There is use of music as well but mostly front channel usage on your home theater system.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />There are three special features included on the DVD for \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\". Included are:<br /><br />  * Behind the Wheel of Happy-Go-Lucky - A five minute featurette featuring behind-the-scenes footage of the driving instruction parts of the film.  Seven cameras used and how they were shot.<br />  * Happy-in-Character - A Half hour long featurette with interviews with director Mike Leigh, Sally Hawkins (Poppy), Alexis Zegerman (Zoe) and Eddie Marsan (Scott).  This was very interesting because you learn about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he wanted the talent to become the character.  And how the film was just built overtime.  A style of filmmaking of keeping the talent out in the dark but enough for them to learn about their roles and be in character.  In fact, almost with no definitive script, the talent just knew about their characters and not so much about the overall storyline since it was written as the film progressed.  Thus, for the driving instructions, Eddie Marsan's thought his character was about a racist, depressed and dark driver's instructor and thought maybe it would be like \\"Taxi Driver\\" but when paired with the character of Poppy and her bubbly attitude and her constant bubbliness and jokes, he was shocked and realized that director Mike Leigh had something interesting in store forthe film.<br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Mike Leigh - Mike Leigh talks about working with the talent and how fortunate he had Sally Hawkins to play Poppy.  Also, Leigh talks about how shots were done via a crane and sets up certain scenes and introducing people to certain British comments and helping the viewer understand the terminology such as \\"Out for Tea\\" which means \\"Supper\\".  There are a few periods of no commentary but overall an informative commentary.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I first watched the film, I was thinking \\"Seinfeld\\".  Mainly because I found myself wondering where was the story going.  Was this a film about nothing but yet still manages to be hilarious?<br /><br />All I was seeing was Poppy interacting with all these people.  But I realized that this was the basis of the film.  Not a storyline about going from point A to point B, it was a story about interactions and how people are touched or were annoyed by Poppy's character.<br /><br />And after watching the special features and learning about Mike Leigh's directorial style and how he really didn't tell the talent about what the storyline was about and learning how much was improvised, you start to realize how special this film was.  From Sally Hawkins portraying Poppy, that was just amazing.  And just the back-and-forth lightning quick banter between Eddie Marsan's Scott and Hawkins Poppy during the driving instructions, I'm not sure how much of that was improvised but that was just brilliant acting.<br /><br />The film was a nice surprise.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and in the end, you are left with many memories and visual images of Poppy and to make a film based on character interactions with no overall plot but basically a typical days in the life of Poppy, the film was quite unique and refreshing.<br /><br />I was a little surprised though by the 80's fashion and at first I was wondering if the film was taking place in the late 80's or early 90's because I never expected to see acid wash jeans in a film ever again but with the talk of texting and Playstations, you realize this is a modern film.  In fact, in one of the featurettes, Marsan talks about utilizing late 80's fashion for his character.<br /><br />But overall, \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" was an enjoyable and an all-out fun film made believable by the wonderful performances by both Hawkins and Marsan.<br /><br />If you are up for something different than the norm, definitely give \\"Happy-Go-Lucky\\" a try.h the talent and how fortunate he had Sally Hawkins to play Poppy.

B00005JPY2|5.0|In the film adaptation of Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen,\\" it is hard to tell who are the heroes.  Set in a dark alternate 1985 with nuclear armageddon a very real possibility, this story is at its heart a murder mystery, but along the way, provides though-provoking insight on the effect of the actions of the characters in the movie.<br /><br />What would it be like to be so powerful that you were not human anymore?  How can you retain that aspect of yourself?  What good is it to fight the small criminals if society as a whole slides into the abyss?  In a world dominated by shades of gray, can the black and white concepts of good and evil hold their meaning?  What if an act of good ultimately does far more harm than good?  Or the reverse?<br /><br />While the movie does not spend as long wrestling with the deepest parts of the graphic novel, it does a fine job of planting them in the brains of the viewers.<br /><br />As with the director's \\"300,\\" this is not a children's comic book film.  This is a dark, violent, confusing world.  Never more so that with the character Rorshach, who steals the movie.  Homicidal vigilante extraordinaire, Rorshach does murder in the name of righteousness.  And the audience will love it.  What does that say about us?<br /><br />This is not the feel good movie of any season, but it is a solid, well crafted movie which defies all the conventions of superhero tales, and by doing so, elevates itself by making the viewer think.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Will (Hugh Grant) is a single man always on the hunt for the next girl. His longest relationship he's really ever been in is 2 months. And that's ok for him. It's exactly how he wants it. Because to him, every man is an Island. One day, one of his dates tells him she has a 3 year old kid, and of course Will is horrified with this, but he goes on with it anyways. Will then finds out she's really into sex, so then Will decides to start dating single moms. But he has no clue how to find them until one day he comes across a flyer for single parents get together. So he decides to make up a child and then go to this meeting. He of course meets a lady there and they go on a date in the park, but Will's `son is visiting his mom right now' so he couldn't bring him along. But she brings her kid and also her friend's kid, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).<br /><br />Marcus is the total opposite of Will. He's a little nerdy and weird. Can't dress `popular' and really just doesn't fit in. Even the nerds at school don't want to hang with him. And honestly, Marcus really doesn't care, because he is who he is. Marcus's mother is a nut job, but she does love him, even though she really doesn't know him like she thinks she does. So after the date, Will and his date, take Marcus home to find an upsetting event that effect Marcus pretty deeply. The only way to cope with what's happened is to talk to Will, because Marcus thinks they are friends now because Will said `See ya later', which Marcus take to heart.<br /><br />Together, they both begin to learn from one another. This part is pretty is pretty clich&eacute;, but it really works because the two are both really likeable. I laughed quite a lot through the whole movie. Hugh Grant is just hilarious and the character of Marcus is just so innocent and loving that you can't help but either say `awww' or kinda laugh at the things that happen to him. He just ignores it mostly and never fights back. I don't know... writing it down just seems kind of upsetting, but you just have to see it I guess. Because kids are really just cruel as most of us know. The dialogue in the movie is great also. I love how Hugh Grant is just straight forward, which is kind of how I am like. He just tells it like it is, because honestly, how will someone really know and understand if you beat around the bush. The scene where he's arguing with Marcus's mom in the restaurant felt, to me, so good because I was thinking exactly the same thing. And another great thing about this moment is the narration from Will and Marcus. It was done really well and was sometimes very funny or very insightful. That was a great touch to me.<br /><br />In the end, I would say own this movie. I've seen it a lot and I still laugh a lot at it. It is a really funny and nice movie. Definitely one of those `feel good' movies.<br /><br />P.S. - God I love accents. Them European accents are so captivating to me. Rachel Weisz plays a sort of small part in this movie, and oh is she so yummy.f upsetting, but you just have to see it I guess. Because kids are really just cruel as most of us know.

B00003Q438|4.0|After a nuclear submarine nose dives into the sea bed after coming across a weird occurrence in the water, the military decides to hire a band of underwater oil drillers to help with the rescue because they have the only underwater movable station in existence that can go down as far as it can go. The leader of the crew is Virgil (Ed Harris), your everyday American man, ball cap, funny jokes, likeable, but a leader that would take a bullet for a friend. The military also gives the crew 4 of its Navy S.E.A.L.S. to help with the mission along with the designer of the station, Lindsey (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), who is also Virgil's soon to be ex-wife.<br /><br />While looking for survivors, one of the crew members comes across a weird phenomenon which in turns almost kills the guy since he freaks out and screws up his tank. While the crew is trying to search for survivors and help out their buddy, the S.E.A.L.S. are doing there own thing, like getting the codes and keys for the nukes on board. After getting back on board, the S.E.A.L.S .take one of the subs out, that's needed for releasing the station from the ship up above, which causes a major disaster since a hurricane is up top rocking the ships around.<br /><br />It's one disaster after another. Oxygen issues, pressure stress, weird occurrences from something down farther below, and nukes. And it's all great. The atmosphere as well as the pacing of the movie is just right. Not one time was I bored in the movie. I actually think everything flowed exactly right because it felt almost real to me (not 100%, but close). I'm not a diver, nor any type of water expert, but almost everything I saw was very believable. When Virgil takes a 20,000 foot decent in a suit, it was really creepy. Everything around was so dark except for his own light. Just falling and sometimes hitting into the side of the cliff. Scary to think about how if that was real. Or when Virgil was dragging someone through the water and you could barely see them even with the lights from the station on them. Looked really good.<br /><br />Not everything was perfect though. There was a, well, mini-submarine battle that kind of reminded me of bumper cars from an amusement park. It was kind of laughable. It just looked pretty stupid. And the ending was a little weird to me.  I liked it, but, I think it could've been less... I don't know... hokey feeling. I like the uncut version though with the mile high waves, but the rest just felt too much like a children's ending to a Spielberg flick.<br /><br />There is one scene that I always remember from this movie and it's a drowning scene. I thought the character that drowns did a great job. It's the person's choice by the way and it all involves a plan. Thought right before it happens, the person starts to freak out and starts saying `THIS IS A BAD IDEA!' and shaking and just going into human instinct to breath. It's so good, that the first time I saw it, I seriously was holding my breath with the person and it was on accident. I just couldn't breath. Good job.<br /><br />In the end, I would say own this. It's definitely a sci-fi movie, but there is just so much more to it. Make sure you buy the special edition to get the uncut ending.<br /><br />P.S. - That rat was actually breathing that oxygenated fluid. That stuff is real.

B00004XPPC|5.0|I was entranced by this movie the whole time.   I wanted Holden's character to just go home to the states.   I wanted the bridge that Nicholson's men built to survive...

6305428050|4.0|Chris (Elizabeth Shue) has a hot date with her boyfriend Mike and is dancing away to `And Then He Kissed Me' when Mike rings the doorbell. To her surprised, he cancels the date so he can stay home with his sick sister since his parents are not home. Of course Chris is upset, but there is always next week. After a little sulking with her friend Brenda, she gets a call to hopefully have her babysit someone she knows, Sara Anderson. Sara's brother, Brad, has a huge crush on her even though he's a couple years younger. So instead of going to his friend's house like planned he decides to stay over. This of course leads to the friend, Daryl, to come over also. And of course he's `that friend' that makes you just *sigh* cause of the some of the things he says or does.<br /><br />Right after the parents leave, Chris gets a call from her friend Brenda pleading for her to come rescue her from the bus station, which apparently must be in hell due to the very strange people there. Chris decides to help her out and has to bring the kids along due to them ratting her out if she doesn't. And that is when the title of the movie begins to go into play. It all starts with one flat tire and a man with a hook.<br /><br />I'll tell ya what, this movie is still pretty funny and still fun to watch after almost 22 years. It is still a charmingly fun movie, and a lot of fun to watch. I honestly thought after having not seen it for quite some time, that maybe it wasn't going to be as a good as I remembered. Wrong. It really was a lot of fun. Sure some parts weren't as great or funny as I remember, but they were still good and kind of funny or silly. Like the blues singing scene. I remember that being really cool when I first saw it (loooong time ago), but this time it was still funny and good, but just not all that like last time. I loved the beginning where Brad is all excited about Chris being at the house and then his mom or his sister totally embarrassing him by saying `Stop fawning over her' or `don't eat chocolate cause it doesn't help your acne'. Seriously my mom did that to me once in front of a girl I had a huge crush on and I felt that guys pain right on the spot...haha. And all the 80's stuff that's just genuine 80's stuff was so cool to see again. Like an older Burger King logo and Sara's backpack. Her backpack had Gizmo on it. Seriously... I want that backpack! And holy cow, the two gangs in the train were hilarious! It was like a bad `Beat It' video. Seriously Michael Jackson could have just popped out right there and started singing. They also reminded me of the `hot cops' from Arrested Development. Remember the episode where George Michael Jr. buys weed for his uncle? Hilarious.<br /><br />In the end, great movie. If you love some 80's movies, then you'll want to own this. I guess I can only think of one bad thing and that's for the parents trying to show their kids some of the `older' movies from the 80s and that is that this movie does have a little bit of cussing. I believed they used the `f' bomb twice.<br /><br />P.S. - A guy that looks like Thor in this movie is played by Vincent D'Onofrio.

B00005JPNY|5.0|and \\"suspend your disbelief\\" for a few hours so that you don't even realize time has gone by, you know you have an amazing creative gift given you from some inspired being out there somewhere on this earth who wrote it.      I'm not going to write about the story line since so many others did that but about how shocked I was there are movies that can still take me totally out of my own life and self-awareness (i.e. suspended disbelief) these days because I have a chronic pain illness.  But this movie is so worth seeing IF YOU ARE A DREAMER and love to ponder about all the possible life that exists in a grand, grand, creation of a universe of hundreds of billions of stars in hundreds of billions of galaxies and who knows how many planets and all of the ways other kinds of life may go about their living...     Then you will find this your favorite movie of the year to inspire more dreaming about all the big things in the cosmos, and then in this life, it will remove you from the little slice of life (1 experience in billions) that we, as humans who find ourselves as earthly beings here, are allowed.  It is based on a cosmic sized or multiple-universe-type world(s).    IF, as one reviewer said, because there is magic involved in the movie there is nothing to learn from it, then for their sake I'd reccommend staying away from all science fiction and fantasy for your own happiness because these genre's have always been about creating settings different from our own to help get around the natural human insticts and fear of change and fear of what we don't know or understand. Just look at all of history to see how that fundament of humanity of what fear of the unknown has done.  And action before thinking caused the worst damage. Esp when thinking disallowed about the opposing things. Endless wars from self-imprinted fears of beliefs and not thinking. Especially racially. And yet it still goes on in a small way in each of us daily.      For example I read a recent study that people actively only look for news that supports their views they already have -- all people on all sides. As this bias/fear is there it should be recognized as all biases should.  If we aren't aware of ourselves why be here?! But, it's not easy and takes effort. And unfortunately studies say we only get more embedded with age which makes sense.  We all want to feel safe.  Sometimes it's true that thinking leads one to feel unsafe. But it's only what you do with the thoughts that could be dangerous.    Such fictions and dreams are essenital for more reasons than I can even begin to go in to here except 1.  Allowing thoughts about everything have gotten us this amazing technical revolution in a short time for human history. And these genre's of which I speak find a way to gently slip in thoughts to let loose that would otherwise not be allowed to be thought of from a \\"home world\\" point of view (ie using real life's real issues).     But with thinking or kicking around a new thought, as opposed to confirming one's views, you can only gain more knowledge and life. Not lose it -- unless you choose to do so and change your mind.      Did you know a number of Arthur C. Clark's technical items/devices he created in his books to make his future world creation work the way he wanted, were read by engineers and scientists who liked the ideas from his books so much they ended up spending their lives then creating his devices, some ended up almost exactly as he described.  Some we couldn't imagine being without now such as the satelite!    But anyway, to those who want and even need to know there is more than this small slice of life - YOU NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE of parallel universes and dreamlands to fill up the dream tank some more. And hope the rest of the Trilogy will be coming to DVD soon!    BTW--where does your mind go when you are actually living the story with the characters in something as amazing as this movie?  Which is so rare for me! :) What an interesting thing to think about!    Now THAT IS LIVING -- thinking freely in a world thaT IS hopefully seeing more freedom everywhere slowly but surely?  If scifi/fantasy authors keep planting such seeds of dreaming then it will be surely!  If there is something to preach it is to preach thinking.  Of all kinds!  Right and wrong!      OH HOW WELL THIS MOVIE/DREAM will wrap you up in wonderings and \\"what if's\\"?  Just to get out of this place for a couple hours... so special!   And Lyra (the main character a young girl) sticks in my mind after seeing the movie - the most PHENOMENAL CHILD ACTOR - and I'm reminded of her when watching other things or talking to people and something comes up because the visuals of the movie stay like rememembering a vivid dream for a long time.  This movie will get in your soul!  What a wonderful creation - not just the movie but - the imagination, don't you agree?!    But this is just a little entertainment we are talking about here after all...  right?
157912626X|4.0|This was the first Miss Marple mystery I ever read, and though it isn't my favourite, I find that it is the one I return to most frequently when I want a well-worn, rainy-day read.<br /><br />In the author's foreword, Christie tells us that she wanted to use the well-known theme of a dead body discovered in a library, but gave herself certain conditions on her use of this clich&eacute;: \\"the library in question must be a highly orthodox and conventional library. The body on the other hand, must be a wildly improbable and highly sensational body.\\" Inspired by the sight of a crippled elderly man at a hotel she was staying in, who was surrounded by family members of the younger generation, Christie merged the two elements together, and arrived at: \\"The Body in the Library.\\"<br /><br />Arthur and Dolly Bantry awaken one morning, only to be told by a hysterical maid that there's a dead body in their library. The news is absurd, but the facts speak for themselves: a very young woman with platinum blonde hair and a sparkling party dress is lying strangled on the floor of their library. Naturally, Mrs Bantry calls up Miss Marple to cast her eye over the crime-scene, and keeps her informed when the police follow their leads to a seaside hotel.<br /><br />The deceased is Ruby Keene, a young woman who was the prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and about-to-be adopted daughter of the wheelchair-bound Conway Jefferson, a wealthy business magnate. This was to the discreet displeasure of his son-in-law Mark Gaskell and daughter-in-law Mrs Jefferson (the respective widow and widower of Jefferson's deceased son and daughter), who both had an excellent motive to kill the girl...but impeccable alibis. Throw in a dance hostess, a tennis instructor, a film director, and you have a fascinating little formula and a water-tight mystery.<br /><br />Whereas Christie's slightly-more-famous detective Hercule Poirot relied on cold, hard logic in the face of baffling mysteries, Miss Marple's techniques involve the study of human behaviour. One of her most famous characteristics is to take a crime and compare it to a domestic issue that took place in her village of St Mary Mead, in this case, she takes one look at the body in the library and makes mention of little Tommy Bond, who put a frog in his teacher's clock. It's not until much later that you realize the significance of this rather incongruous statement (and sometimes it can be a *little* hard to believe that she reaches these conclusions so quickly - the woman sometimes seems clairvoyant. But then again, Miss Marple IS much more intelligent than I am!) How she can tell that a couple is married, how a girl is lying, how a dancer wasn't wearing what she should have; all have solutions that will leave an awed sort of smile on your face.<br /><br />Christie herself had a razor-sharp mind, a cynical outlook and a great sense of humour, which means the characters and the human relationships they're involved in ring impeccably true, even by today's standards. For example, there is a moment in which a relative of Jefferson wishes that he'd chosen a girl of a higher social standing to be his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, and Miss Marple gently points out that this would defeat the very purpose of the exercise. The fact that Ruby Keene was poor meant that as her benefactor, Jefferson would enjoy the way in which she was dazzled by his wealth and generosity. Marple compares the situation to King Cophetua and the beggar maid, and on reading the passage I remember marveling at the human truth of this situation: how the ego of an old man could colour what may initially appear to be simple altruism.<br /><br />In many ways, this is a comedic book: many of the characters are played for laughs, there is a shrewd eye turned to the portrayal of the upper and lower classes, and Christie even manages to name-drop herself when a young detective fan rattles off a list of his favourite mystery-writers. And yet, the tragic death of two girlslingers in the mind well after the book is finished. To a point, one can sympathize with the killer's disposal of common gold-digger...but in order to do so, he/she also had to snuff out the life of an innocent. The cunning of one life and the blamelessness of the other are held up in comparison; two lives that are linked only in death and a person's greed for fifty thousand pounds.sympathize with the killer's disposal of common gold-digger...but in order to do so, he/she also had to snuff out the life of an innocent.

0316017922|5.0|This is my first audiobook. I dug it! Gladwell explores why Bill Gates and Bill Joy have excelled so well. This is extremely interesting to me given that I write computer software for a living. He also explores why Asian students excel at mathematics. I boggled at his point that American students have a long summer vacation because early reformers didn't want them to learn too much. Overall, Outliers is a well-written book with a lot of interesting points that will change your ideas of what creates and influences success.
B0012GVKW8|4.0|I'm so impressed with the quality of the presentation of this film (which I've seen 1000 times on other formats) that I didn't even notice the lack of extras until someone mentioned it.  I watched it on my PS3 via HDMI, hooked to a 47 Phillips LCD HDTV 120hz.  The picture quality was excellent.  Those people who claim it looked like the regular DVD need a new HDTV, or an eye exam.  In my opinion the picture quality was better than T2, Die Hard 2, and Total Recall (I'm referring only to the blu-ray format of these movies).
0545128285|4.0|At first I was disappointed since I thought it was some type of continuation of the Harry Potter series, but it isn't. It's a very small book with a few stories that would be the equivalent of Hansel and Gretyl or Rupunzel. It was cute my favorite story being \\"The Hairy Heart.\\" There is a moral to each of the stories and then Dumbledore goes into explaining what it means.  What sucked is I ordered through Amazon and paid like 13.00 and I just saw it at our local bookstore for 6.00 which is what I feel it is worth.
B000HIVOI2|5.0|\\"Stargate\\" is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies and this release is well worth having. The picture quality is not quite as good as hoped, but it is certainly more than acceptable.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me. The story centers around Daniel Jackson (James Spader), an Egyptologist who's \\"crackpot\\" ideas have isolated him from his academic peers, and Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell), a very troubled Special Forces Colonel, as they unravel the mystery of the Stargate and deal with hostile aliens (later known as the Gould). Interestingly, several of the of the actors who appear in the movie also show up in the SG-1 series, but not Spader or Russell.<br /><br />This is very good Sci-Fi and should be watched if you are planning on seeing [[ASIN:B000TJBNHQ Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection]] or the spin-off [[ASIN:B0018SLGG0 Stargate Atlantis Seasons 1-4]].<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0970377215|5.0|Few new books rival old ones!  G.K. Chesterton's Orthodoxy (Image Books edition, 1959) was first published in 1924 and deserves repeated re-readings.  In it he seeks \\"to state the philosophy in which I have come to believe.  I will not call it my philosophy; for I did not make it.  God and humanity made it; and it made me\\" (p. 9).  After, trying, as a young man, to be avant garde and daringly original, the mature Chesterton simply \\"discovered what had been discovered before\\" (p. 11), orthodox Christianity, the tenets of the Apostles' Creed.  Had Tom Oden read, as a youngster, and heeded, Chesterton's message, he might have avoided some lamented dead-end pathways.<br />  As a young man, an agnostic by the age of 16, Chesterton cheerfully embraced the reigning notions of modernity.  He had no grounding in Christian philosophy; he naively accepted what educators and publicists said concerning \\"certainties\\" such as Darwinism.  His journey to orthodoxy came when he read the alleged authorities (Huxley, Spencer, et al.) and found them advocating learned nonsense.<br />  For all their intellectual sophistication, Chesterton found \\"moderns\\" in his day befuddled by \\"the suicide of thought.\\"  Thinkers doubted there's truth to be found, though they never doubted the truth of their personal thoughts.  Espousing materialism, they insisted everything (thought included) flows from rigidly determined sources, making free will and personal decision meaningless.  Yet, of course, they passionately argued their views and insisted you change your mind and accept their mechanistic interpretation of events!<br />  One thing struck me, noting the intellectual heavyweights Chesterton debated:  most of them today are utterly passe.  The most advanced thinkers fifty years ago have largely slipped into the wastebaskets of intellectual history!  More current champions now dominate the academy and the media, though their ideas, differently dressed, haven't changed much.  Yet the orthodoxy championed (if not Chesterton himself) remains continually contemporary.<br />  For example, Christian dogma gives one reason to believe in both the dignity and depravity of man:  created in the image of God we have a right to assert human dignity, but fallen in Adam we find it necessary to seek forgiveness and grace.  At the heart of Chesterton's message is an abiding awareness of the necessary truth of original sin, \\"the only part of Christian Theology which can really be proved\\" (p. 15).  Modern thinkers, then and now, prefer to evade this truth, but accepting it enables one to make sense of oneself and one's world.<br />  In addition, Chesterton found himself amazed that anti-Christian polemics seemed so contradictory.  (One critic would complain that Christianity was too complex, the next would accuse it of being too simple.)  So Chesterton turned to Christian sources to discover for himself exactly what was being attacked.  There he found the key which re<br />claimed for him the world he'd hungered for since infancy, the \\"romance of orthodoxy.\\"<br />  Like C.S. Lewis's Mere Christianity, Chesterton's Orthodoxy is one of those slim treatises we may rightly deem a \\"classic.\\"  It helps bring us back, with delightful style, to the substance of historic Christianity.<br />  # # #odoxy championed (if not Chesterton himself) remains continually contemporary.

I admit it, I couldn't help but get a lump in my throat as I watched and heard Phil and the band play Still in Love With You. I only wish they would have included the songs Southbound and Johnny The Fox. Minor complaint. If you're a Lizzy fan then I don't have to sell you on getting this DVD, you already know what a special band they were. If you're not a Lizzy fan then hey, this isn't a bad place to start! Long live Lizzy!!<br />[...]
B001E75QGG|1.0|Indiana Jones 4 was painful to watch- surving a nuclear blast in a refrigerator? the car chase scene in the jungle? aliens? seriously this was just pathetic and I was better off never seeing this movie, I wish I could un-watch it.
1596912863|4.0|I recommend this book if you....    1) Have read Pride and Prejudice or you enjoy any version of the movies (especially the BBC version).   2) Want a quick, fun read to keep you entertained for a while (ex: on a plane, train or automobile... preferably if you are not driving).  3) Don't take yourself (or your books) too seriously! If you do, this book will not satiate your desire for some \\"novel\\" (haha!), deep characters or plot. It's just a fun read!  4) Like Shannon Hale's other books. This is a nice way to see other sides to her wonderful mind!  5) If you can identify with feeling that ZING, like the main character, when you watch the \\"piano scene\\" in the BBC version of P&P. Hello, anyone? (=    All in all, this book is like the main character's escape to her own \\"Austenland\\": a short, fun, fluffy, but enjoyable trip to a fantasy world, where you can't look too closely or you will be distracted by \\"imperfections\\" (ex: if you are looking for a deep plot) and totally miss the point of being there. It's a fun trip- ENJOY!

B00005NB8K|5.0|The Doors, directed by Oliver Stone and starring Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison is an epic and visually stunning film that attempts to tell not only about the rise and fall of a band, and in particular its singer, a complex and enigmatic figure, but also about the \\"Strange Days\\" of a unique period in history known as The 60's. People who complain about the facts being distorted are missing the point. Due to the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, this film isn't aiming for objective truth. It is Stone's vision, and besides, a lot of the events didn't occur in the physical realm at all:<br /><br />------<br />Jim Morrison: I believe in a long prolonged derangement of the senses to attain the unknown... Although I live in the subconscious, our pale reason hides the infinite from us.<br />=================<br /><br />What we have with Morrison is a rock star who wanted to be a poet--who was a poet. He wanted to be Dionysus, the god of wine, the inspirer of ritual madness and ecstasy, and he became Dionysus. In becoming the physical embodiment of Dionysus on Earth he may have fudged his facts. He may have neglected to mention that his father was an Admiral, rather than deceased as he claimed. In creating his own myth, he may have played fast and loose with the truth, but once again, you are missing the point.<br /><br />\\"Mr Mojo Risin\\" is an anagram for \\"Jim Morrison\\"<br /><br />Val Kilmer really wanted to play this role, and he tried very hard to be cast, even going as far as recording a demo of himself singing Doors songs. According to Stone and some band members, when given the blindfold test with Kilmer's tape, they couldn't tell the difference. From the first frame of The Doors he IS Jim Morrison. He starts out as a young and relatively innocent Jim Morrison and carries the character through to his final days as a bloated and bearded beast. Jim Morrison was the self proclaimed Lizard King. Morrison WAS the Lizard King, but he could also be an obnoxious drunk, and both things are true. Val Kilmer gave an awesome performance as Jim Morrison, both the poet and the obnoxious drunk, both the man and the myth.<br /><br />Aiding and abetting Val Kilmer's performance, just as The Doors ably supported Morrison, was an excellent cast with a few standouts that I would like to mention:<br /><br />Kyle MacLachlan as Doors Keyboardist Ray Manzarek, Kevin Dillon as drummer John Densmore, and Frank Whaley as guitarist Robby Krieger were very supportive. They kind of stayed in the background, but as sidemen that is their gig. When you have a charismatic actor like Val Kilmer playing an even more charismatic singer like Jim Morrison, you know you're not going to steal the show. They all learned how to play their instruments, which took a lot of time and practice, though MacLachlan may have had it in his blood already, as he claims he's a descendent of Johan Sebastion Bach.<br /><br />Michael Madsen was Tom Baker, an actor best known for a Warhol film, \\"I, a Man\\" but he was friends with Morrison long before that. In the film, I got the impression that they met through Warhol, but the reverse is true. Morrison was supposed to play opposite Nico, but management talked him out of it, and he suggested his drinkin' buddy Tom Baker for the role. Anyway, Madsen is menacing as Baker, even though Morrison has already descended to a pretty depraved level, you are concerned when Madsen shows up. Uh oh, this guy is a really bad influence! Actually, Madsen provides one of the best scenes, when Baker berates Morrison for becoming a bloated beast and belittles his accomplishments:<br /><br />-----------<br />Tom Baker: [to Jim] Whatcha gonna do for act three, man? Puke on Heaven's door?<br />=================<br /><br />Billy Idol as Cat has a good comeback, though. He tells Baker that IF he ever does anything, please tell him so he can whiz on it. Billy Idol was supposed to have a much bigger role but due to a motorcycle accident, it was severely curtailed. A pity.<br /><br />Meg Ryan gave a great performance as Pamela Courson, Jim's girlfriend. She was somewhere between Sally Albright in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and Bonnie in \\"Hurlyburly.\\" Kind of a girl-next-door, all bright and bubbly, who with prolonged exposure to Jim's decadence becomes a bonnie bit of guttersnipe. Ryan wavered between and balanced the two extremes well.<br /><br />Kathleen Quinlan portrayed Patricia Keneally well. Patricia was a rock journalist who questions some of the facts in Morrison's self made myth, but also falls for the devil may care singer. In fact, she's a practicing Wiccan and the two are wed in a Handfast ceremony. Quinlan was also in Apollo 13, giving her a Bacon Number of 1. The real Keneally complained that she was falsely depicted, but Stone admits she was a composite character culled from perhaps 10 different women, compressed into her character in the name of dramatic economy.<br /><br />Michael Wincott also made quite an impression as record producer Paul Rothchild. Though he no doubt looked nothing like the man who had produced the first six of The Doors albums, besides lots of other credits to his name, Wincott gave another of his trade marked intense performances. Catch him in \\"Basquiat\\" if you want to see more of his work.<br /><br />Like Mr Mojo Risin', Oliver Stone is likewise in the myth creation business. He bent the facts to dramatize the story and make it more cinematic. I wasn't buying so much Oliver Stone's use of the Indian Shaman as metaphor, but I will allow him such conceits. Director Oliver Stone felt a deep connection to the singer that began when Stone was a soldier in Viet Nam. He wasn't a popular music person before that, but hearing The Doors music really struck a chord. His first screenplay, which formed the basis for his film \\"Platoon\\" was originally envisioned with the main character played by Jim Morrison, and Stone actually contacted Morrison about playing the role. Stone sees The Doors as filling the void in all that Flower Power during the 60's. They were the darkness amidst all that sunshine. He sees a parallel with himself in that he's an artist who goes to that dark place, who pushes into that deep, dark abyss.<br /><br />There are a lot of people who didn't like his depiction of Jim Morrison and The Doors, but I take a different view. Ray Manzarek has since said that the movie is a horrible account of the history of the band. Ray did not participate or contribute in the making of the film, though he was asked. Maybe his dissatisfaction prompted him to write his own book in 1998: *Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors*. The other two band members, Krieger and Densmore, participated in the film. In fact, Krieger wanted Stone to do the project because he was a fan of the film \\"Salvador\\" and he convinced the other Doors to sign on. Densmore's book, *Riders on the Storm: My Life with Jim Morrison and the Doors*, an account of the band's rise and fall from his own perspective, was a primary source of material for the film. It took 20 years for the film to be made, mostly due to getting permission from the band and family members.<br /><br />So, bottom line: It was Oliver Stone's tribute to Jim Morrison, and if other people saw him differently, they should write their own book or make their own movie. If you want to learn more about Jim, read those other books, or better yet read his poetry and listen to his music.<br /><br />It's fitting that Jim Morrison is buried in Cimeti&egrave;re du P&egrave;re Lachaise, alongside such poets and artists as Honor&eacute; de Balzac, Guillaume Apollinaire, Sarah Bernhardt, Georges Bizet, Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, Eug&egrave;ne Delacroix, Isadora Duncan, St&eacute;phane Grappelli, Amedeo Modigliani, Moliere, Yves Montand, &Eacute;dith Piaf, Marcel Proust, Gioacchino Rossini, Georges-Pierre Seurat, Gertrude Stein, Alice B.

B000Z8GZYW|5.0|While I've enjoyed Bill Murray in Ghostbusters, Stripes, Caddyshack, etc, he can become tiring in a movie.  In this one, he seems to have toned down his comedic side and added serious acting resulting in his best performance.  I always wonder if it's the actor or the director who finds this balance.  His attempts at serious roles, Razor's Edge, Cigarettes, and Lost in Translation just don't seem to fit him.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|I LOVE this album!  I really enjoyed \\"Trouble\\" and I didn't think he could put out anything as good, but this one fares the same.  It has a totally different sound than his first album, but is really good.  Ray Lamontagne is quite the musical genius!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I really enjoyed this series, and was glad to add it to my Blu-ray collection. The picture and sound are all phenomenal, but there is very little else on the disc other than the actual episodes. I would have liked to see some special features like a making of which I remember them showing after the series finished it's initial run. The lack of those extras is the only thing keeping this from a 5.
1400082773|5.0|This is a remarkable book that I would definitely recommend to anyone as a starting point for learning more about Obama. Of the many words used by critics to describe it, there are none that I would dispute: eloquent, moving, highly readable, honest, unpretentious. Obama is a very skilled writer and succeeded masterfully in articulating his compelling life story even at the young age of 34.<br /><br />Of the three parts, I found the last one on Africa to be most interesting, since I've lived here all my life. The culmination of the book in the epilogue is brilliant.
B000001ZS5|5.0|I had the 33rpm vinyl album of Magnetic Fields as soon as it came out, and played it often enough to wear out the grooves. The quality of the CD is top notch, and definitely holds up to the sound I remember from 1981 (I guess when you're talking about actual digital music, the whole \\"vinyl vs CD\\" is kind of a moot point.    As far as the music itself is concerned: this may be the most accessible album Jarre has ever made (aside from Chronology). If you're starting a Jarre collection, start with this one, then ease into his more experimental work.    For what it's worth... recommended tags include \\"New age\\" - Jarre has never been \\"new age\\". Electronic, yes. Synthpop, yes. New age... no.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I've seen both Vincent and Frankenweenie in muddy VHS or 2nd gen copies before, so it is an added delight to have these brilliant shorts together with one of the best animated features ever made!
B001AX9DT0|4.0|If you are a Ray Lamontagne fan, this album is enjoyable, but not his best.  It took me a few days to really warm up to this album, since I think his previous two were so good.  In the end, I do enjoy this album, but definately not as much as his first two albums.  Still, a good album for his fans.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Supernatural. I was delighted to find the 3rd season at a reasonable price. Great show. Can't wait to buy Season 4.
0451205766|4.0|I often enjoy reading books that I've already seen the movie of to find out how the book was adapted into a screenplay.  I assume most of us have seen the film, so here's what I think...<br /><br />As it goes in Hollywood, the writer often gets shafted from participating in the \\"for the screen\\" version of the story.  Supposedly, Puzo and Coppola did get together and work a good deal on the screenplay, but also supposedly Puzi was unhappy with the studio regime and in the end got shafted anyway.  He said, she said... who knows.  BUT.  That being said, I think the screen translation is far better than the book.<br /><br />First of all, most noticeably is the pacing of the film compared to the book.  The book is loaded with extra details about secondary characters that the film only establishes briefly.  For example, the girl that Sonny is cheating with.  The second bodyguard after Paulie leaves the picture, Tattaligia, etc.  Lots of these details are quite interesting, but rather destroys the pacing of the book.  The book gets more highly involved with the move to Vegas by the family and how they set up their operations in the west.  The book could do well without these facts, as they do not really relate to the meat of the story.  (although, admittedly since I have seen the film so many times... perhaps its been embedded in my system to get used to the pacing of the film)<br /><br />Other noteworthy changes are some of the backstory that we see in Godfather Part II... are in this book.  When the Don is a youngster living up in NYC and he assassinates the Black Hand.  This, as most of the rest of the novel, are copied pretty verbatim for the film.  It's interesting that Coppola decided (rightly) not to use some of the flashbacks of the novel... but got the chance to for the sequel.<br /><br />I'm not sure if it is the version I have or if it was in the original text, but there are many grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and seemingly even words missing entirely throughout the novel.  Maybe this happened in the transcription... maybe Puzo wasn't a good writer?  Who knows, but it doesn't distract too much.  It's just very noticeable.  The book is an incredibly easy read as well.  No fancy words you'll have to look up in the dictionary.happened in the transcription... maybe Puzo wasn't a good writer?  Who knows, but it doesn't distract too much.  It's just very noticeable.

I've kept up with her since she sang on the one show for MTV(yea totally drawing a blank some fan lol)  But she is totally awesome this able personally isn't the best she's done but I still love it.  I recommend it for anyone who likes Anastacia and also just needs some down time to themselves.
B001N3OCV6|1.0|Why did they leave out all of the good music?    It's missing the song that is being played during Dr. Manhattan's story on how he became the way he is. If you know the name of that song, please post it here.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|this was a very good album. rock and roll train is catchy. all in all, a good addition to a great rock band. it is a great rock band, just to make that clear. i heard one reviewer say that highway to hell and back in black were the two worst albums of AC/DC. what?!?!!? with classics like 'you shook me all night long' and 'highway to hell' these may very well be the best of them. this is by no means as good or better than those, or even the razors edge. if your an acdc fan, or even if you arent, you might want to give this a try
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout for calorie burn. She gives (3) levels of routines an all of them offer some type of challenge. I used level (1) for about a week - then I quickly went to (2) and (3). I feel great after each of them and I feel like I am getting results in just a couple of weeks.     You do not have to stick with one level - I use each level during the week (for example: level (2) on Monday; level (3) on Tuesday; level (1) on Wednesday; level(3) on Thursday; level (2) on Friday). I would recommend this DVD to anyone.
B000ZN802W|5.0|for his own family. McCandless was able to form quick friendships which were more deep and sincere on the parts of the other people, his were rather more superficial at that point in time. He was filled with the angst and implacable censoriousness of youth and none of the appreciation for the fallibility of people, e.g., his own parents. Ostensibly it was the revelation that his father had continued relations with his first wife while married to his second and this sin, in McCandless's eyes, colored his entire life including his education, a career and any and all \\"things\\" that were in any way reminiscent of his parents. He nursed a cold rage against his father especially and used this revelation to justify his extreme callousness and carelessness toward his entire family including the sister he was so fond of and the abandoment of his car, a vehicle he supposedly treasured. He planned to inflict the ultimate hurt against his family by plotting his own disappearance and was so focused on this goal he lost sight of right and wrong and only considered his own wants which doomed him to die of starvation alone in the wilderness.<br />His arrogant, brash nickname \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" was another symptom of his hubris which ultimately seared his family with sorrow and drove him to a cold and lonely death in the old bus with no one around to comfort him in his last moments. He had fun playing the adventurer, for a while, then when he faced the reality of the situation he placed himself in, the fun and adventure vanished and he was left only with his very bad decisions. He went into a cold, forbidding environment virtually unprepared and without any supplies to speak of; tiny changes to his venture would have ensured his survival but it was not to be. Something as simple as slicing thin strips of the moose he killed and air drying them as opposed to smoking the meat and ending up with a maggot filled mess. Carrying beef jerky and dried fruit with him would have helped, pretty much any common care would have resulted in life instead of death and I do not believe for one second he intended or wanted to die. But he chose to ignore wise advice from people who had successfully gone into the wilderness and tried to give him the benefit of their own experiences...he even refused one man who offered to take him to buy adequate supplies. McCandless refused. It is a waste, it is not romantic at all, it is a tragedy and all the young men and women who find this event adventurous and exciting and worship McCandless and deify him are all sadly mistaken. The film was excellent and the music and actors all superb, but ultimately it describes a vengeful, angry, selfish, self centered young man who harbored a horrible grudge against his family and never even discussed this with them, but chose to plot to wreak revenge on them instead, which he did succeed at, his only success in this doomed adventure.y much any common care would have resulted in life instead of death and I do not believe for one second he intended or wanted to die.

B001N3OCV6|2.0|12 songs? Really?   I was amazed by the sheer amount of music this movie held. Great songs all over the place. As I sat there watching the movie I thought, man I need to get this soundtrack!   12 songs... not even all the good ones!   Lame to put out a $10 cd with a fraction of the songs that actually appear in the movie. I am waiting for the second volume where they feature the rest of the songs and want us to pay $20 for that one... milk it for all you can.     I would just skip this and just get the 2 or 3 songs you actually want.

It also contains extras, a karaoke \\"extra\\", and other bonus material.<br /><br />I hope this helps - if you want to own this classic on DVD, I definitely think the box set is worth the extra dollar.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00005JPY2|5.0|In the opening sequence, we see the Comedian get thrown out of a high rise apartment window. Meanwhile, Nixon has just been elected to his third term. The political tension can be cut with a knife; Russia and the USA are on the verge of a nuclear holocaust. Masked heroes (or vigilantes if you prefer), the Watchmen, have been banned awhile back through the Keane Act. Rorschach never gave up his mask even after the Keane Act was passed. He searches for who killed the Comedian and wonders if they are trying to kill off the rest of the Watchmen. The rest are the Silk Spectre (okay it needs to be said, but her hair is awesome), the ever-so smart Adrian Vedt, and \\"closest thing you can get to Clark Kent\\" Nite Owl. The only Watchman with \\"super\\" powers is Dr. Manhattan (physicist; his powers came to be after an accident). Does Dr. Manhattan care enough about humanity to save it from itself? Is there anyone else who could? The characters in the graphic novel are NOT knights in shining armor. Some have dirty pasts, some do dirty things. For example, the Comedian tried to rape one of his cohorts. Its so hard to praise this film because its such a close copy of the graphic novel. I dont want to knock Alan Moore by saying Zack Snyder did a wonderful job. But I'm not going to hate the movie so I can stay 'faithful' to the graphic novel's writer, y'know. So, are you going to like this movie? The acting is good, the visuals are stunning, and the special effects and fighting scenes are great. Some people will automatically never give this movie a fair shot because of what it is an imitation of something near perfect and some people are going to walk into this expecting a Superman story and just wont \\"get it\\". I, however, thoroughly enjoyed this film. Who watches the Watchmen? I do, and I want Silk Spectre's hair.
B00005JPY2|5.0|First off, thank God for Zack Snyder, and this movie is near flawless! It inst exact to the book but it was good enough for a film adaptation!

ITS BETTER THEN THE DARK KNIGHT AND WILL LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS!!! SCREW ALL THE HATERS OUT THERE! THIS IS WATCHMEN! WATCH IT OR DON'T BUT DON'T HATE IT EITHER! RORSCHACH FOREVER!!!
B000006TRV|5.0|\\"Album oriented music\\" refers to the idea that an album should not be evaluated on the basis of any single selection, but on the basis of the collection as a whole.  It was a notion that went hand-in-glove with the idea of \\"concept album,\\" in which every single selection was in some way related to every other selection in the collection.  \\"Rock opera,\\" which involved piecing together selections to create a narrative, was not too terribly far behind--and a double album release was considered a test of creativity, prestige, and the ultimate marketing coup.  All four of these were signature ideas of 1970s popular music, and all four reached a final critical mass Pink Floyd's 1979 THE WALL, which put a punctuation mark to decade before the on-rush of the excessive synthesizers and flashy music videos that characterized much of the 1980s.<br /><br />Most bands go through cycles in which the musical ideas of one particular bandmate overrides those of the others--and in the late 1970s Pink Floyd fell under the near-absolute domination of Roger Waters.  Originally given to psychedelia and progressive styles, and often tinged with a certain meloncholia, Pink Floyd became darker still, with the 1979 THE WALL the ultimate result.  So ultimate, in fact, that Waters left the band shortly thereafter, declaring that Pink Floyd had run its course. As it happened, he was greatly mistaken: although he was no longer a part of it, the band continued on with significant success.<br /><br />Although it received broad critical approval and sold extremely well, THE WALL was not immune to criticism even in 1979.  Then as now, it was a work that you either really liked or disliked--and a good many of those who disliked it were Pink Floyd fans who had been so enthusiastic about the band up to that point.  It was, they complained, musically bloated and the story it told was trival.  I myself, eighteen when THE WALL was first released, was not particularly enthusiastic about it, and for exactly those reason.  Over time, however, my opinion has shifted.<br /><br />It is indeed musically bloated.  I suspect this actually arises from the techology of the day.  In 1979 record buyers expected each side of an vinyl album to run at least twenty, twenty-five minutes, and the entire album forty-five minutes to an hour.  Anything less and the buyer felt shorted.  Even at this run time most albums contained significant filler, songs that weren't necessarily bad but which didn't measure up to the best of the cuts.  It logically followed that a double album would have double the music--and there indeed are a number of points in THE WALL where one feels the music has been spread a bit thin with repetitions designed to meet the quota of minutes the format required.<br /><br />The story is indeed trivial--but only if you regard it in the way you have been told to do so.  When THE WALL was first released, a great many critics focused on the narrative element and rushed to tell us all about it. THE WALL is about a rock star named Pink Floyd.  His father was killed in the war.  His mother was suffocating.  His school years were hell.  His wife left him.  The pain cuts him off from the world and now he uses drugs and alcohol that drive him into a personal chaos which he himself ultimately condemns.  Yep: that's THE WALL.  Okay, sure.<br /><br />But THE WALL is not a narrative in the sense that it starts at point A and continues on to point Z, and if that is what you expect you are bound to be disappointed.  It presents its events with a certain randomness, touching upon one, detailing another, returning to the first, flashing back and forth between traumas in what seems to be a drug-laced and nightmarish confusion.  The album famously opens with what can only be described as a classic stadium-rock sound--only to collapse suddenly into a plaintive, often industrial sounding series of vignettes that speak of man and the machine.  Selections float to the surface of this wash: \\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Nobody Home,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" all of them bitter, angry, despairing, with snips of sound and phrases and melody that reference each other in much the way a tangled mind might.<br /><br />The great failing of THE WALL, at least in my opinion, is in the last few minutes of the recording, when the rock star suddenly jolts into a fit of self-evaluation and self-condemnation in a serio-comic sort of way.  I've always found this bit a little forced, and I think the overall concept would have been better served with a more direct build toward the same anthem-like statement that opened the album.  But I have to say that, all things considered, this is a trivial complaint; while THE WALL may be flawed, and while its easy to second guess the band that created it, it hangs together remarkably, exceptionally, extraordinarily well.<br /><br />Bleak?  You bet.  Glitchy?  And how.  Flawed?  Absolutely.  Does any of this undercut its singular value?  Not hardly.  Worth the cost?  And then some.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Nobody Home,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" \\"Run Like Hell,\\" all of them bitter, angry, despairing, with snips of sound and phrases and melody that reference each other in much the way a tangled mind might.

B00005JPY2|4.0|Let me just start by saying that I've never read Watchmen and I am not a comic fan in general, but I thought this movie was great.<br /><br />Before watching it I, of course, checked reviews and saw that there was a great divide between the reviewers. They either hated or loved it. So, obviously, I had my reservations about watching this movie in the first place. But I dragged my husband to the theater anyway. And I am glad I did so.<br /><br />So many complained about the length of the movie, sex and violence, awful ending. I found none of it. The movie was almost 3 hours long but I never got bored even for a moment. I liked the pacing of the story, flashbacks and flashforwards. It was almost like reading a book and I love reading. Sex and violence? Come on, it was rated R. What did people expect? Ending was also great for me, true to the story and thought-provoking.<br /><br />However I do understand those who thought the movie was hard to follow and slow. Some people just want to watch movies for instant gratification and can't put any effort into actually thinking about what is going on on the screen. My husband is one of these people, so I am used to it and can understand the frustration.

140120841X|5.0|V For Vendetta is a groundbreaking masterwork unlike any other. It is brilliant, imaginative, and all around amazing to read. This graphic novel is a truly remarkable experience in itself, and anyone whose up for a good read with a very deep and twisting storyline, along with a governmental and political plot line are in for something great. Also, if your a fan on Alan Moore's \\"Watchmen\\", then V For Vendetta is sure to be something you will absolutely adore.    (No Spoilers Ahead, just an outline!)  So we have V, a Guy Fawkes masked anarchist who wants nothing more then to show the people of England how corrupted their government and lives really are, and little by little his plan unfolds, until he meets a woman named Evey Hammond. Now Evey seems like any other women, but Evey shows V something more, she shows V that not all are corrupted and that their is still some good left in the human spirit. Taking Evey into his underground home, codenamed The Shadow Gallery, Evey is not allowed to leave, for the risk of revealing V's location. So when the story is set, V and Evey become entwined, and their destinies are now linked, and they both have one goal together, one thing in mind, to bring down the government and let the people choose their futures, to let anarchy be the way, to let \\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" to be the law of the land.    If you did see the film, then you already know some outline, but I will say this, THE BOOK AND MOVIE DIFFER VERY MUCH!!! The book is better of course, but if you saw the movie and expect the book to be the same thing, IT'S NOT! It's much different, and much more intriguing!    All In All, no one should miss out on this classic work of vendetta and retribution against a corrupt government and a world in flames. V For Vendetta is very close to George Orwell's \\"1984\\", In the sense of the totalitarian government. So I hope this helps, but if your a fan of something in this genre, then read V For Vendetta, you will not regret it.    P.S. Anyone who has read Watchmen, or V For Vendetta, and has not read both of them, I strongly recommend you do. If you love one, you will love the other. They don't have anything to do with each other, but their among Alan Moore's two best works of all time. I own both graphic novels and I still don't know which one I like more, having read both around 3-4 times each, they are both very good in so many aspects! If you haven't gotten into the world of graphic novels before, now is the time, and these two will definitely make good editions to your book collection!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Several years ago when rumors really began heating up about the possibility of an actual Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, I thought that there would be no way it would really work. Sure, comic book movies were on the rise, and director Sam Raimi had shown to us that a man really can web-sling and wall-crawl, and Bryan Singer proved that super-powered mutants do exist; however, a man in a metal suit flying around still seemed like an awfully daunting task to make us believe. Now, these weren't the first rumors of an Iron Man movie coming to the big screen, they were just the most credible. No, rumors of this project have existed since around 1990, when it was being bounced from studio to studio. Even some Hollywood A-listers, such as Nicolas Cage and Tom Cruise, were being tossed around as possible stars for the vehicle, and director Quentin Tarentino was one of the primary contenders for the directing job (who knows what the movie would have ended up like if any of this had actually come true). However, none of that ever came close to fruition, and the project lay dormant for almost 20 years. That was until director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey, Jr. made the movie into an incredible reality that took the 2008 summer box office by storm.    Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a rich, powerful, and undeniably brilliant weapons manufacturer, womanizer, and self-centered man who lives the life so many dream of. But that all changes when he finds himself captured by a terrorist organization who want to use him to create weapons solely for their own evil purposes. With his options limited, Stark does the one thing no one ever expected him to do, he becomes a hero. Clad in a metallic suit of his own design, Tony finally knows what his purpose is in life, and as the hero known as \\"Iron Man\\" he now has the means by which to protect the people he once put in harm's way.    Truth be told, the long wait between those first rumors in the 90's to now, was probably just what the movie needed to become a true success, for several reasons. For starters, the technology necessary to create the obligatory visual effects sequences (of which there are many) involving the metal-clad hero have finally become available, as proven by the smash hit \\"Transformers\\". Prior to that film I don't believe some of the visuals achieved in this movie would have been nearly as convincing to audiences. Second, the perfect casting choice was made in the form of Robert Downey, Jr., a talented actor who has had his fair share of troubles (many of which are surprisingly similar to Tony Stark's in the comic books), and one whose star power wasn't great enough that his private life would outshine anything done on the screen. Lastly, Marvel was finally able to create their own movie studio, allowing them full creative control and ensuring that the character and story were as true to the source material as possible. It's for all these reasons listed here, and even some that aren't, that \\"Iron Man\\" became such a successful adaptation, and had the film come to fruition sooner, who knows what the outcome would have been.    The story for \\"Iron Man\\" is two-fold: on one hand the story is a tale of redemption for a man who has lived a life of self-indulgence and freedom from any sort of consequences to his actions; while on the other, it is a fairly faithful to the source material origin story of a new kind of superhero that was born out of one man's sheer will-power to live. As a moviegoer and comic book aficionado I love when an adaptation of one of my heroes comes to life on the big screen as both a faithful representation (or as close as one can get to decades of comic history in only a couple of hours), as well as a really strong film that isn't just a bunch of summer popcorn movie fluff.    The screenplay written by the writing teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (\\"Children of Men\\") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway (\\"Punisher: War Zone\\") was surprisingly cohesivegiven the number of hands stirring the pot, so to speak. Generally, when the number of writers goes beyond two, the chances for the film actually working out all that well dwindle significantly; however, \\"Iron Man\\" proved to be one of those rare exceptions to the rule. Filled with plenty of humor, action, drama, and a dash of romance, the story for \\"Iron Man\\" is easily one of the best origin adaptations for a superhero that I have ever seen in a movie.    As great as the story was, I would be remiss if I didn't mention a few of the minor problems that crept into the film. These problems aren't in any way overtly distracting from the end result, but they should be addressed all the same. First, from a purely comic geek standpoint the film's location was completely wrong, Stark is based out of New York City (as are most of Marvel's heroes), yet the film takes place predominantly in California. Personally, this alteration to the origin didn't actually bother me, but I know it did some purists, and I can understand why. Second, the attempted twist involving the film's villain was poorly executed, and was easily seen from the very beginning; however, I don't believe the intent was to actually make the primary villain's reveal all that much of a shocker. But there was obviously some attempt made to surprise the audience, and if it actually succeeded it would only be for those not paying close attention. This problem wasn't like the first, where I didn't really care either way, because it did kind of frustrate me that more effort wasn't put into this twist to make it somewhat surprising. Like I said, in the end these problems weren't anything major, but they still existed nonetheless.    For this film, fledgling Marvel Studios wisely chose to sort of buck the Hollywood system by going with some truly surprising, yet inspired choices for both cast and crew. Choosing Jon Favreau (\\"Elf\\") as the director was a shock to many, and even caused some to wonder just how good this film could actually be. Sure, Favreau proved he could handle family comedy with \\"Elf\\", and some of his early work is fairly dramatic, and as far as visual effects goes, he did a decent enough job on \\"Zathura\\"; yet, would he have what it takes to tackle something as big as a comic book icon's first major film adaptation? Apparently, the answer was yes, and any questioning of the decision was quickly silenced when Favreau debuted some footage during Comic-Con, much to the vast delight of many a comic geek. The other shocking choice, and arguably the most disputed was that of casting troubled actor Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Even though he hardly seemed the proper fit for the character, Robert perfectly captured the very nature of Tony Stark right down to his physical appearance, quick-wit, and attitude, for all intents and purposes Downey, Jr. was Tony Stark through and through.    Comprising the supporting cast of characters, were a group of talented actors and actresses whose hiring weren't nearly as scrutinized. Gwyneth Paltrow (\\"Shakespeare in Love\\"), although not my first choice for the role, turned out to be the perfect Pepper Potts, Tony Stark's personal assistant. It was a decidedly different role for Gwyneth who typically does more dramatic work, and even more surprising, while at the same time a very smart move on her part, was that this was the role she chose as her first project post-pregnancy hiatus. Joining her was Jeff Bridges (\\"Arlington Road\\") as Obadiah Stane, Tony's mentor and right-hand man in operating the day-to-day activities of Stark Industries. For fans of Jeff's work, many will be surprised by how different he looks as this character, with his shaved head and full beard, Jeff is almost unrecognizable from his appearances in virtually every other movie he's ever made. Rounding out the main supporting cast members is Terrence Howard (\\"Four Brothers\\") as James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes, an Air Force pilot, and close friend to Tony Stark. Terrence was again another terrific choice, and he really played well off of anything Robert Downey, Jr. would throw at him. Their typically light-hearted conversations full of playfully intended put-downs and sarcasm really helped to solidify their close, almost brotherly bond the two men share with one another. All in all, the casting for this film, whether heavily questioned or just unquestionably accepted, couldn't have been any better as each of the cast members delivered top-notch performances.    \\"Iron Man\\" was one of 2008's biggest blockbusters, second only to \\"The Dark Knight\\", and the film rightfully earns its place amongst the best comic book adaptations ever made. Boasting a strong story, visually stunning special effects, brilliant casting decisions, and just some good old fashioned fun, \\"Iron Man\\" is not just a comic book blockbuster, but a great movie that audiences will enjoy over and over again. By the way, be sure to watch after the credits for a bonus scene that offers a hint of things to come.    \\"Iron Man\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and brief sensuality.

This movie will come back to mind for many years to come. It is a shocking eye opener. I wouldn't discourage parents from watching it, as knowledge is power. It is a true horror story. Heart-breaking. How could it be possible? It makes you wonder how much of this serial killing stuff goes on. Be aware.
031606792X|5.0|I was wary about this book after reading many of the reviews, but because I loved Twilight I felt compelled to see the saga through to the ending and I was not disappointed.     ******SPOILERS******* SPOILERS*****************SPOILERS************          The best part about Breaking Dawn was Edwards and Bella's daughter Renesme ( a beautiful child who Bella almost did not live to see.) This child has an amazing ability (similar to Edward's but not quite the same), chocolate brown eyes, and long, curly bronze hair; a perfect blend of Edward and Bella.    Although I am a sucker for happy endings, I loved the suspense which caused me to hold my breath and made me tear for these characters who had so much at stake. I knew they were going to make it... but still I was caught up in the tension and fear.     I definitely recommend this novel, its a delight and truly enjoyable.

B00006JDVV|3.0|Although the CGI effects looked fantastic, and McConaughey and Bale were excellent, I found Reign of Fire to be very dull. Other people liked this film and that's fine, but personally I wasn't really entertained when I watched this movie. The action sequences weren't that exciting, and the dragon fights weren't really interesting. Maybe it's because of the old and tired stereotypes of the dragons that annoy me. Oh well, at least I enjoyed \\"Equilibrium\\".<br /><br />Grade: C
B0013JG7IQ|4.0|The art direction and cinematography are great.  But what's really exciting is the emotional depth(lacking in the original fairy-tale libretto) that's added by reimagining the setting as  the battlefields of World War I.  The libretto is translated (perfectly appropriate for Mozart, who authorized both Italian and German versions of Marriage of Figaro), and the new English lyrics revitalize the story without straying too far from the original.  I'm not sure this would  be a good introduction to the opera, but if you know it already, each new twist is a delight.  The singing is lovely.  It's not world-class opera quality, but it's more than adequate for what this is, which is a great movie rather than a visual record of a great performance.

The clothing, the way the setting was created, the actors were wonderful you truly felt as if you are taken back in time and you were there. I enjoyed it so much that 10 days later I purchased the Elizabeth Gaskell library collection - I didn't even care that the collection contained Cranford in it again, so now I have 2 Cranford DVDs. I watched them all and now I'm starting again. If you like that period in time - you will love these DVDs, if I were you I would purchase the collection so you have all 3 stories.    Enjoy, Sandi

B001PPGAIA|5.0|While I don't know if Nicole Kidman has the same star power anymore (is her forehead growing?), this is a great film for her, and Hugh Jackman. I enjoyed this movie much more than I imagined I would.  I don't usually like love stories, but do enjoy action movies. My daughter enjoys love stories and not action movies.  We were both happy and never lost interest for a single moment. And even though it is long at over three hours, I really didn't want it to end.    It's just an interesting time period, gorgeous setting, and great story.
B00005JPY2|5.0|I cannot say simply that I liked it or disliked it, the only simple response that I can give was that I hadn't notice how much time had passed when it was over.     It was completely outside of what I was expecting-- and I consider that a good thing for a film.    The story, the visuals, the acting, for me can best be summed up with another anachronism: it's a trip. Not necessarily a good trip, or a pleasent trip, or even a trip that makes much sense-- but undeniably a trip.    Malin Akerman sports a long, straight, jet black hairdo for the movie and she is gorgeous. Jackie Earle Haley, of Damnation Alley fame, was great as Rorschack. Those were the standouts.    It's an adult movie, in every sense, so keep that in mind when deciding to watch it.
1416562605|2.0|Not nearly as engrossing as I expected it to be.  The setting is India and the author's voice is definately Indian. That cadence and 'English as a second language' feel makes for an authentic experience but not necessarily an engaging one.  The writer tells us up front and without remorse that he's killed his employer, then spends a lot of time backfilling the reader about his impoverished background.  It's a gritty look at the poverty and inept/corrupt way Indian society works, so probably a 'nutritional' read but (like brussel sprouts) not necessarily something you'll enjoy.

B000GGSMB2|5.0|Al Pacino has always and will always be one of the best actors in Hollywood. Of all his films though, I strongly believe that this is his best performance...he actually convinced me he was a Cuban refugee. As well Brian De Palma directs beautifully this film, which is in fact written by acclaimed Director Oliver Stone. All of these elements make this film a complete winner for all time.<br /><br />In Scarface we have Tony Montana (Al Pacino) he has recently arrived from Cuba through the Mariel. By the way the film takes place in the 80's, during the time of The \\"Marielitos\\". Around 125,000 Cubans left the harbor Mariel and went to the United States in what is known as the Mariel boatlift. Immediately in the opening we are told the nature of the film, so don't worry, you will not be confused. After the opening credits we are introduced to Tony, a Cuban refugee, nothing to loose and nothing to offer. Shortly in the movie he begins to mange illegal Drug business. First he transports it, and then he goes higher and works for the \\"big boss\\".<br /><br />I wouldn't want to ruin the entire movie, it has alot to offer. Interestingly enough is that the movie isn't complex at all, it's very straight forward. What makes the movie triumphant is the way it is directed and shot, not to mention Pacino's remarkable performance. All of those factors made this film a winner.  I'm still surprised that Pacino never won an award for this..Instead he won it only for \\"Scent of a Woman\\" Have still yet to see it, but I doubt it's better than this one.<br /><br />The majority, even if they have never seen this movie, know the famous phrase \\"Say Hello to My Little Friend\\". Both the phrase and the entire scene demonstrated how well of an actor Pacino is. As well the scene exemplifies the nature of the drug world. The score of the film is another great factor in the movie, especially in the last shot.<br /><br />If you are planning to get this movie, I suggest you get the Platinum 2 disc Edition; it brings dozens of extras and presents the film for the first time digitally Re-mastered in a High Definition Transfer, with Re-mixed audio in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. The quality has never looked this better on DVD, perfect sound and picture quality guaranteed.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5and presents the film for the first time digitally Re-mastered in a High Definition Transfer, with Re-mixed audio in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.

B00000JLWW|3.0|I felt this movie had a lot of good points, and equally a number of bad ones. I'll start off with the good. I thought that the special effects were fantastic, particularly the scenes where the ship was sinking. I thought that they got the layout of the ship very accurate, and you could really sense the 'newness', freshness and splendor of this ship on its maiden voyage. It certainly had a feel of 1912 about it.<br /><br />Now the bad points. I felt the love story of Jack and Rose was awful, and highly improbable, particularly for the times. Their dialogue is really poor, and almost cringeworthy at times! The way they act, and talk, just does not ring true for 1912. Also, the mystery ship seen in the distance by officers and passengers, during the sinking, widely believed to be a tramp steamer, called the 'Californian', does not rate a mention in the movie. This is an important part of the 'Titanic' story, that has been omitted.<br /><br />I felt this movie was to a certain extent a wasted opportunity. A Night To Remember, is for me, still the definitive 'Titanic' movie.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|If it weren't for the fact that the first two were done very well, that the acting was good and strategic, keeping those who dont know how to play the part of an action hero to minimal show times (halle berry), then maybe I would give this film 3 stars. But this was disappointing. It was the perfect example of Hollywood taking a perfectly good series and crapping on it because they want to rush through a summer blockbuster. They changed the director. They changed the head writer. You got to ask yourself why the hell would they do that? I mean the writer was the writer for American Pie for god sakes. The answer was that the director was doing Superman Returns and wanted to finish it before moving on to the next project. The studio told him to stick it, they didn't want to wait, so they pushed a new director through. The movie was a Hollywood wet dream of Fan Boy pandering, explosions, little acting and story, and even a tribute to the famous Juggernaut Youtube video. For those of you who said it wasn't the first two movies but it was still fun, just imagine what it could have been. The X-men 3 The Last Stand is nothing short of disappointment.
0440244870|4.0|I am a prolific romance reader and so it seemed only natural to read this book as well. Well the movie was not nearly as good (entertaining in its own rite though), the book is a hit. Out of 10 stars I would gladly give it a 9. Why only 9? I guess I am just a tough critic. It is by far the funniest book- historical, fictional, contemporary or paranormal- that I have ever read. If you are interested in more of my reviews feel free to check my list or read my blog ([...]) and email me with any book suggestions (romance only though:).
B000MRAAJM|1.0|After watching ¾ of the first disk, I had to stop because I felt like I was brought to a slaughter plant to watch for two hours how animals are being killed alive; one animal after another, with close-ups, in slow motion, with numerous replays from different angles, with no mercy or desire to make it less graphic on the screen. I was so depressed I couldn't believe that somebody actually liked it. This video must be sold in a horror department or at least some warning should be put on the box. I don't care how important killing is in animals' life, but I believe this is one of those disturbing moments that must be avoided in the videos aimed at general audience. There are other more artistic ways to convey to the audience the importance of \\"food chain\\" in wild nature than just show acts of eating of life preys in slow motion. I think that the authors were after cheap \\"shock and awe\\" effect more than anything else. If that's what you are looking for, it is a great work and you will get a lot of excitement. But if you don't enjoy watching animals being killed, don't bother buying this DVD.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|In the past, Mac users haven't the luxury of well designed gaming accessories like this. I was really impressed at how well the software worked and how seamlessly I was able to start using it.     What i found tho, is for me, this takes some serious getting used to. Serious gamers usually have developed their own ways of gaming, either with a keyboard or mouse, etc. and even tho this comes with profiles for a lot of top games, it means having to essentially re-learn how to play the game. To be honest, once I got it and played with it, I set it aside as I really wasn't ready to relearn. Only now, a week or so later am I taking the time to figure out how to use it right.    1 big downside that others have pointed out - the joystick on the right side of the unit is NOT a mouse or a trackball controller. You can assign keys to it like move forward or back, etc, but its not meant to replace the mouse. That means you need THIS unit and a mouse to do whatever it is you want to do. Its not a standalone gaming device.    I do have to complain that the CD that came with the unit did not have an OSX install, I had to go to the website and search for the product and install the drivers and tools manually. No biggie but c'mon guys. At least a note in the box tell me where to go would have been nice?    The unit itself is very rugged & well built. The back lit keys are very cool and the lcd display very bright and legible. The construction is just superb. It feels very solid and well made.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|After \\"Magic\\" bought us some of Springsteen's most powerful music in years, one would expect him to follow it up with another solid collection of powerful, dramatic and relevant materiall for his follow up release.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Working On A Dream\\" does not live up to the potential. Whereas \\"Magic\\" sounded inspired and fresh, \\"Working On A Dream\\" is stale and forgettable. Bruce's lyrics are some of the worst he has written in years. He shows very little imagination throughout most of the album, and at times it sounds like he took whatever rhymes were cooking in his head and simply put them to music.<br /><br />Take for example, the overblown opener \\"Outlaw Pete.\\" Bruce tries to capture the magic of such classics as Billy Joel's \\"The Ballad Of Billy The Kid\\" and Elton's classic \\"Tumbleweed Connection\\" album, with a musical recreation of the Old West, but lacks the imagination and musical embellishments that Joel's song a classic. Bruce's lyrical attempts at making the titular character sound threatening (such as a ludicrous line about serving time at six months old) are almost pitiful for an artist of Bruce's talent.<br /><br />Then there's the fourth track, \\"Queen Of The Supermarket,\\" a corny, slightly creepy ode to a female grocery clerk, with as many predictable supermarket related cliches as possible thrown in the lyrics and an annoying vocal arrangement and pedestrian melody, not to mention a random, unnecessary F-bomb midway through the song.<br /><br />Some songs, like the \\"up with the people title\\" track and the rollicking \\"My Lucky Day,\\" the latter which could pass for a \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" outtake, contain sing-along chorus and catchy, foot tapping melodies, but are dressed up with no place to go musically. \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" is an AM pop number with a Manilow / Neil Diamond quality that become annoying after awhile, even though it's compelling enough at first.<br /><br />There's some genuinely good moments, to be sure. \\"This Life\\" is a solid Beach Boys tribute with many excellent Brian Wilson production touches, and \\"Good Eyes\\" is a great blues number. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is one of my favorites, a simple country ditty with a mellow tone that somehow gets me. \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"Kingdom Of Days\\" are also strong efforts that make up for the banality in the first half of the album.<br /><br />The album's two finest moment come in its last two tracks, first being \\"The Last Carnival,\\" a touching tribute to Danny Federici with angelic harmonies that serves as nice prologue to \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story.\\"<br /><br />Of course, the album's most enduring number comes in its closer, a \\"bonus track.\\" Mickey wrote \\"The Wrestler\\" as a favor to longtime friend Mickey Rourke who was starring in the film of the same name (and has since made a much deserved comeback). Much like the film, the song \\"The Wrestler\\" is a brief, emotional masterpiece, simplistic but powerful, quietly taking the lister into a peaceful sunset.<br /><br />Overall, however, \\"Working On A Dream\\" will ultimately go down as one of Bruce's weakest efforts in his mostly excellent career. It's passable, but not a wholly worthy effort from The Boss.Brian Wilson production touches, and \\"Good Eyes\\" is a great blues number. \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is one of my favorites, a simple country ditty with a mellow tone that somehow gets me. \\"Life Itself\\" and \\"Kingdom Of Days\\" are also strong efforts that make up for the banality in the first half of the album.

B00005JPY2|5.0|This has got to be one of the longest films I've ever watched but I wished it would never end.  It's hard to organise my thoughts into a coherent whole but here are a few pointers:    - Jackie Earle Haley deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of hard-as-nails Eastwoodesque vigilante Rorschach    - Billy Crudup deserves an Oscar for Best Actor in a Nude Role    - you get to see superheroes making love    - the music blows your mind: Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah, 99 Red Balloons (in German)    - there are more ideas in the first five minutes than in the whole of most Hollywood releases    This movie made me wish I had read the original comic strip in the 1980s.  In fact I've never read comics seriously but I understood (I think) and loved every minute of The Watchmen.

386521584X|4.0|The controversy surrounding this book is the perfectly natural - even compelled - result of the fact that 83 pictures cannot begin to represent the absolute infinite number of perspectives on life in the United States - or, the world, for that matter.  Indeed, that it is titled \\"The Americans,\\" with the intimation that it is a definitive photographic explication of the topic, demands the debate.  Nevertheless, the pictures are deeply evocative and I am so pleased to have it in my library.<br /><br />One other note on Mr. Frank.  I became familiar with him through an interview on the Bob Edwards radio show related to the fiftieth anniversary of the book's publication.  In that interview, Mr. Frank noted that he saw southerners in the fifties as \\"arrogant in their righteousness,\\" and went to express his gratitude that things had changed since then.  Having been born in the deep south in 1954, and having lived here all my life, I share some of Mr. Frank's gratitude that things have changed.  However, pockets of the South remain backwards, despite the changes that have taken place around them.  In these pockets, folks remain overbearing in their righteousness - arrogant and primitive in their fundamentalist religious faith.  Often as not they abuse - simply because they can get away with it - those who don't think according to their prescribed and, sadly, myopic \\"norms.\\"  In these areas, anti-intellectualism is seen as a positive character trait.<br /><br />But, if you have a genuine interest in - and are open to the idea of - seeing the world through insightful eyes, you wouldn't be wasting your money on this book.

0743290119|4.0|I am guilty of skim reading so I initially missed some of the character changes and had to start the book over by chapter 3.  When the author switches character stories there are no obvious breaks so it takes a few chapters to get used to.<br /><br />Sorry for those who did not enjoy, but if you thought the characters were shallow; what were the expectations about a plotline of three single women living in New York in their 20's chasing after men and diamond rings?  I picked up the novel because I just wanted something light, and fun. If you enjoyed reading Sex in The City or Confessions of a Shopaholic then you will most likely enjoy this book.
0143038419|3.0|I've read some of the negative reviews for Eat, Pray, Love and while I do agree that it was VERY self-indulgent.. I think it was to be expected. Come on, do people REALLY take 1 year vacations to wander around the world post-divorce? This book is essentially Under the Tuscan Sun but dumbed down. It can't be expected to touch upon the poverty and class isuess or tackle the guru's sexual inappropriateness. And, if you take it as it is - of one woman's solo adventure to 'find herself' as naive as it may be, then this book is a great read. It's an easy read and captures you into the story.

B0016B6ZKG|4.0|I am soooo glad to see Donna Summer is back with a new release after 17 years. And she has taken the Cher route and not the Vanessa Williams, Diana Ross route to make a comback. Vanessa and Diana made the mistake of making a collection of remakes for their comeback. Diana did have one new song on her's at least but still they were the same old songs sung countless times before. Cher with Believe made an awesome cd with completely new songs done in today's style and thankfully that is what Donna has done. Stamp Your Feet is her Believe. What an awesome dance song, Definitely the stand out on the cd. People can not believe that it is Donna Summer after all these years. I play that song all the time and loud in my car and have people asked me who is that? The other 11 songs are very good as well. The weakest song, ironically is Crayons, I just don't care for reggae music that much but is still ok. Donna will always be known for Last Dance and as a dance diva but she is sooooo much more. This cd brings her front and center after all these years and I am sooo glad it is selling well. A brand new younger generation, who may not be all that aware of her past achievements, will love this new collection and be introduced to Donna. So drop this cd in and enjoy the Return of Donna Summers with Crayons. It is a feel good, updated and awesome dance collection. This is the first new cd I have felt was worth purchasing in years!!!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I'll admit that I read the books (all eight, straight through, and I was not, before this, a 'vampire fiction' sort of reader) after seeing the HBO series, but agree with others who say you need to judge each on its own merits.  I think the books were a blast, but I also loved the series and think trying to stick too close to the books would not have worked well in this medium. I (and several previously non vampire-addicted friends) can't wait for season 2 and hope the dvds have lots of good extras.

0930289234|5.0|Good graphic novel / comic!<br /><br />I honestly had never heard of \\"Watchmen\\" or writer Alan Moore until the \\"Watchmen\\" movie preview started showing up on the internet last year!<br /><br />I wanted to read \\"Watchmen\\" before I went and saw the movie and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The characters in \\"Watchmen\\" are very original. I personally liked Rorschach & Dr. Manhattan. Nite Owl, The Comedian & Ozymandias were good characters too, all having their moments throughout the novel. Dr. Manhattan could easily be a stand alone super hero, with a whole line of graphic novels about him, he's that impressive.<br /><br />The overall story is excellent and it has a smart ending that leaves open the possibility for a sequel. As Dr. Manhattan says, \\"nothing ever ends\\".<br /><br />Within \\"Watchmen\\" there is a sub-story called, \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", which is a comic being read by a teenager at a newspaper stand. I thoroughly enjoyed it, I thought it was a real comic. After searching for it online, I found out that its not, but it was made into a animated film \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" and will be released on DVD, Mar. 24th and is narrarated by Gerard Butler - King Leonidas from \\"300\\"!<br /><br />Writer of \\"Watchmen\\", Alan Moore also wrote \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"From Hell\\" and \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\", all of which have also been made into good movies.
B001NFNFNU|1.0|I saw this movie with high expectations, having seen Angelina Jolie in other memorable roles. She under-acts throughout \\"Changeling,\\" and is unconvincing in this true story. She plays a 1920s woman in Los Angeles, Christine Collins, whose nine-year-old son goes missing. Now, I would expect her to be out of her mind with fear, but instead, Jolie whimpers and gets teary-eyed, as if she just suffered a minor scrape. I don't understand director Clint Eastwood's motivation for the graphic depiction of the torture and murder of nine-year-old boys by a sadistic serial killer. Those scenes were horrifying and excessive.

B001AQO3WY|5.0|I read through the \\"1 Star Reviews\\" and was unimpressed, such individuals obviously lost the point of this series completely. After buying and watching the entire series three times, truth is; this series is great; its dead honest. It doesn't glamorize war, killing, or the lifestyle of the Marine 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. If you want a left or right wing slanted view of the war, look elsewhere. If you want a real look at the initial invasion of Iraq, the command level military bravado/arrogance, lack of communication, lack of proper planning/equipment, amazing officers and grunts, as well as the totally incompetent and incapable officers and grunts, and the real feel of the fog of war and how individual personalities \\"fit\\" into all of this, this is a great series to watch. I will also add that the \\"characters\\" represented here are in-part \\"played\\" by the real marines which this story is about. The screenplay was written by the embedded reporter of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, and \\"lived\\" with \\"B-Company\\" for about 9 weeks. This embed Reporter was advised on the creation this series by the \\"real\\" same Marines whom this story is about. It is as accurate as you are going to get for a \\"mass media\\" related film, the only closer you can get, is actual footage.    Many complain about the \\"civilian killing\\" and \\"dedicating / urination\\" content, but to be honest; its accurate. Its no 5 Star hotel nor is it something to be overlooked if you want to be complete and honest. Truth is in war -especially this war, you can never be sure of whom your shooting at until your being shot at, so you do your best to make the right decisions; this series underlines that and the struggle to do this while following -at times, insane orders.
B000022TSW|5.0|I was 9 years old when I saw this movie at theatres in 1999. To this day, I still don't know how my mom made it through the movie! I love it, it's extremely hilarious and has awesome songs. Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated movie by Terrance & Phillip. They learn the 'F' word and start cussing at school, which gets them in trouble with their moms. Kenny dies, and is sent to Hell. We find out that Saddam Hussein is having passionate sex with Satan. When Terrance & Phillip are killed at a U.S.O. show, Satan will take over earth, so it's up to the boys to save Terrance & Phillip at all costs, until a huge war between America and Canada starts. I highly recommend SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, & UNCUT!!!
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|As I near 50 I can relate to the character of Walt played by Eastwood in this film.<br /><br />No, I don't mean I am some extreme racist.... but I do share his disdain for the declining sense of values, morals, etiquette, honor and other  behaviours we see in our society as the ugly elements of urban growth and the negative aspects of demographic shifts take a grip of America.<br /><br />Hey, human society has never been perfect -- there is no such thing as the \\"good old days\\" --- but there was a time when people took pride in their neighborhoods, were quiet and considerate of others and you could let your children play outside all day without even thinking or worrying about street gangs or pedophiles attacking them.<br /><br />I watched GRAN TORINO with a group of people all over the age of 40, and at various times during the movie we each commented .... \\"Hey' that's me\\".<br /><br />This revelation was not one of astonishment but one of sadness as we all agreed that the USA today sure isn't the same place we all grew up in the 70s and 80s.<br /><br />Some watch this move and focus on Walt's character overcoming old fashioned racist stereotypes to befriend his new neighbors.<br /><br />Others also comment on the equally significant social commentary in this film that essentially shows us that although his speech and manners may be rough and course, Walt basically has the right view of how America is changing for the worse.<br /><br />Like Walt, it seems we have had to move every 10 years or so as the urbanization and social decline of America gradually destroys once good neighborhoods and sickens our society like a cancer.<br /><br />This is a much better film than much of the stuff nominated for awards this year (big surprise) and actually TELLS A STORY instead of being mindless eye candy and CGI special effects.<br /><br />Definately an addition to the DVD collection.

1582701709|5.0|This book is the greatest book that I have ever read! If you don't understand what the Law of attraction is, then the Secret breaks it down without bias to religions or politics for one to understand! It is awesome and sparked an interest in the Law of attraction for me to dig in and find more information.<br /><br />The message and \\"gist\\" of this book is merely to believe.  It is based on the simple premise that you become what you think.  This is very similar to the effects of prayer-- when people concentrate on one thing, and think positive thoughts-- good things can (and sometimes actually do) happen!<br /><br />All in all, once you drop your guard and accept what these people say as basic universal truths and not some feel-good marketing ploy, then you are all set.  You don't need to go into reading this with your guard up-- it's not trying to undermine your religion or philosophies.  It is trying to illustrate-- in a different way-- how powerful it is just to be positive in your life about everything.  This is common to ALL religions I think.<br /><br />Everything you do is a feedback loop and is all connected.  It makes sense to be positive, and if you are having trouble doing that this book might help you find a way to do just that.  Life is what you make it, and that is what you should take away from reading this.<br /><br />The great part of this philosophy is that you don't need someone else (preacher, rabbi, priest or whatever) telling you how or what to think.  If you make the Secret your own, you won't need them anymore (and I think God will understand and be happy for you!)

B00004YA66|4.0|Even if you accept the basic premise of this movie, a re-connection between long dead fireman father and still grieving policeman son via ham radio, you will find something profoundly illogical in some of the individual scenes. That doesn't prevent it from being extremely moving thanks to beautiful flat-out emotional performances by Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel and flawlessly cast supporting actors. Look for an extraordinarily moving fire rescue scene. Some of the suspense set pieces worked into the story are superb.  This film definitely overcomes its narrative flaws.  Walmer Road in Toronto puts in a fine appearance as a street in Queens, N.Y.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Many previous reviewers have failed to realize that ths is based on a graphic novel, which was confusing at best. The manic goings-on must've been hard to make coherent, but I thought it was fun (Better than the source material). Everyone knows that Ms. Jolie can do action with the best of 'em; Morgan Freeman can do just about anything; but it's Mr. McAvoy who charms, channelling the whimsy of his \\"Narnia\\" role into a flesh and blood loser who finds a cause. His journey is well portrayed, and I think he was a fine choice for the role (unlike what  others thought). The action is unrelenting, and it was fun to watch. The Academy recognized some technical achievements with nominations for its mastery of sound/sound effects, but some of the CGI effects were fresh enough, I thought, to deserve a nomination. The editing was superb. Director Timur Bekmambelov has put together an original; giving freshness to a milieu that has started to lose its punch (the graphic novel). I liked it a lot.  No DVD extras; bummer...
6305736650|5.0|Just remember this! Watch it once and you'll never forget it. The story has been scene 1000's of times. Boy meets girl. They fall in love. Girl leaves boy. Boy meets girl again. Anger! They express love again. Girl and boy are seperated once again. The plot is full of iconic characters, but you can't help but fall in love with these people and this movie. The lines will be etched in your heart even if there is only a hint of romantic hidden deep inside. Bogat is hard and the envy of all of us who wish we were this cool. Bergman is beautiful. She is stong and vunerable at the same time. The supporting cast is memorable. This film is, and always will be a CLASSIC!

I love this CD. some want to keep trying to compare it to Confessions.  I think when people stop comparing the CD to others and accept it and appreciate it for what it is they will realize its a wonderful CD.  You can't compare ushers cd's because each cd he grows up so much more and each cd is at another level in his life. (mainly because he doesn't drop CD but every 3-4 years, when soo much has changed)    I can play the entire CD all the way through.   A must have, for real music lovers.

B0013FNC38|5.0|I had never heard of Jason Mraz before January 2009. I discovered him when my local radio station started playing his song \\"I'm Yours\\". I loved that song so much that I wanted to find out more about Jason Mraz.    I wanted to know was Jason Mraz a true singer/ songwriter with staying power? Truly talented? Or was he a one-hit wonder, or just a thinly disguised marketing ploy?    So, I went on Amazon and ordered this cd and 2 of his other cds. I was so happy to see that this man is a truly talented musician, singer, and songwriter.     \\"I'm Yours\\" is still my favorite Jason Mraz song but I like his other songs as well.     Buy this CD and his others as well. You won't be disappointed.

B000305ZS4|5.0|Built in two parts, the first being drenched into dark nature and space, bleak and eerie paths that lead to the fifth song where the gate opens leading to the second part of the opus which is becoming of bombastic arrogance riding on symphonic skeleton to culminate with and ode to dark powers, reaching simultaneously the highest of the peeks.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|I am into artists who write their own songs and are not produced stars like so many of today's musicians that are at the top of the charts. I am a bit old school in my tastes, which is reflected in the music I own and frequently listen to. I am by no means a country music fan, but heard a couple of Taylor Swift's songs from her self-titled debut album and quickly became hooked. It was obvious these were HER songs, not the work of another writer. There is something about about people who write stories in their music. They have 3-4 minutes to tell them, and Ms. Swift wastes no time in delivering. It's clear from a majority of her songs that love is on her mind. This is one young woman that has found tough luck in that department. She certainly has been on the wrong end in her view more than once, and she's not afraid to write about it and share it with the rest of the world. So far her words have been transcended in pop-country tunes, but since she can play guitar, I would expect as she matures as an artist it will pick up an edge and become more blues/rock.     That said her sophomore album is a fine effort. Catchy tunes, good lyrics, stories we can relate to. \\"Change\\" will grab many people, the rest will strike a chord with the younger generation. I'll admit, it's not going to be a CD you find too often in my player or listening to on my iPod, but the body of work is to be appreciated. A fine effort from a budding songwriter/storyteller. It's clear Ms. Swift has a very firm grasp of who she is and how she expresses her self in her music make her come across as being more in touch with her emotions than many adults who are her senior.     She's definitely on top of the world at the moment and someone to keep an eye. There are some musical influences, you get get a sense of My Chemical Romance in one song. Breathe is a collaboration with the talented Colbie Caillat.The Way I Loved You was co-written with John Rich. I don't think you'll be disappointed in exploring Fearless.
0316286850|2.0|I purchased book years ago before his passing after an appearance on Oprah. He does FABULOUS makeup and this book is more for admiring that....how he can transform celebrites like T-boz, Gweneth Paltrow,etc. He gives you very basic info but not detailed instructions like instead of saying get MAC such and such color lipstick or Nars such and such colored blush he says taupe colored lipstick or orangey shade blush, descriptions like that.....not good if you don't know what blush is orangey or if you need something warm or cool, etc...More high level for maybe an aspiring makeup artist with plenty of makeup experience. Haven't found a good book for makeup application but there are several great tutorials online...you can see real time application and exact products to purchase to achieve a look. More for admiring not teaching. Recommend going online until you find a better how-to book.
B001FB55H6|3.0|7/10 Stars<br /><br />Upon reading Alan Moore's Watchmen I was blown away by its complexity and attention to various small details that could be present in a society where caped crusaders were a part of everyday life, and the loved the philosophy presented within the panels, but now I am forced into the difficult task of judging this movie adaptation of the infamous graphic novel.  Upon seeing this movie I wrote an initial review of my opinion, but realized there was something wrong with it.  The problem was that I was spending more time praising Moore's novel than the actual movie, so I deleted it and decided to start from scratch after spending a good deal of time reflecting on the movie and flipping through the panels of the comic.<br /><br />Now I am torn between liking and disliking this film adaptation of the beloved graphic novel.<br /><br />On one hand I love Moore's original story and comic.  On the other hand I am not very fond of director Zack Snyder's previous films (the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 300).<br /><br />On one hand this movie mimics the visual style of the novel very well and looks very well polished.  On the other hand Snyder and his team in their dedication to perfectly mimicking the story of the graphic novel have made this final product come across as very mechanical and unmoving.<br /><br />For the most part the actors pull of their parts, but none of them really go above and beyond to truly make the characters anything more than iconic images lovingly ripped from the panels of Moore's story.  There were only two actors who I felt really tried to do something with their characters in an attempt to enhance the characters, and they were Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian.  Aside from these two performances I feel that most of the actors were so determined to fit Snyder's idea of matching the book perfectly that they failed to take the initiative to really try and break the wall and make this movie more than the graphic novel put into motion.  But, not to leave him out of this review Billy Crudup did do a satisfactory performance behind the make-up and special effects for his portrayal of Doctor Manhattan, but it wasn't good enough to really get my attention when compared to Earle Haley and Dean Morgan.<br /><br />We also get decent performances by a few minor, supporting cast members, such as Robert Wisden as Richard Nixon.  He wasn't no Frank Langella and his make-up was rather off part of Snyder once again trying to carbon copy the graphic novel), but it was by no means a bad Nixon performance.  A good supporting act is also given by Carla Gugino as the first Silk Spectre.<br /><br />Even with the few acting problems the production is a good and it is strong.  The images are dazzling, and very true to the comic.  It is definitely one of best providers of eye candy we're likely to see 2009, but then we have to remember visuals aren't everything, and that's why I was let down by this film.<br /><br />My biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is the lack of initiative that the production crew took when making this film.  It's like they took up a diet of respectively redoing the comic for twelve weeks until they remembered each panel perfectly and made the actors do the same.  Most of the actors don't look like they're really into their roles, and the production is just a fanboy dream come true, but it manages to do one thing that made me mad that keeps me from rating this higher than a seven.<br /><br />If this had just been a visual comic down to the letter I would probably give it an 8/10, but the few times Snyder decides to take action and add in his own little ideas to the plot it just really distracted me from the concept of the story, and ruined the mood for me.  What is it that Snyder is adding that angers me so much?  Perhaps the most pointless gore and drawn out sex scenes I have ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />The gore is tacky, and cheap, and distracts from the story, and philosophy behind the images.  Many of these images were not in the graphic novel, and nor were they ever even HINTED in the graphic novel.  In this movie we have arms broken wide open, a man has his arms cut off, and a man repeatedly has his head cut into by a meat cleaver.  None of these moments ever took place in the graphic novel, and I felt they threw off the pace, and distracted the viewers from what was actually going on, and I won't even talk about how he drew out a sex scene that was like six-panels into a 5-10 minute scene.<br /><br />My favorite part was by far the opening credits, and I don't say that in a bad way because it was really a brilliant way to open the movie.  To the tune of `The Times They Are A Changin' we get an animated series of photos that maps out most of the Watchmen's history, the universe they live in, and the setting for the rest of the film.  This moment alone makes this movie a must-see for fans of the comics.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film very positively because I for one was disappointed by the finished product.  I'm sure many will rave about this film, and it's sure to become a cult-classic, but compared to the graphic novel it really is nothing.  Watchmen may be the most endearing comic of all time, and is a classic for the medium, but as a film its impact will not be as lasting as films such as last year's The Dark Knight.  The comic will always be remembered as a great, and an incredibly unique, original tale, but I fear this film adaptation will slip away into strictly cult-movie realm over the next twenty years.e images.

B00005R23S|2.0|I have always like Bruce Springsteen but never owned any of his music - after the Super Bowl I decided I needed something so I read the reviews in Amazon and made my choice for the DVD - Bruce has done some good music but you really have to get by alot of the booring same sounding stuff to get to the good songs - Kind of like buying an album with only a couple of good songs on it.
0316017922|4.0|Overall, the book went sort of slowly for me. He makes interesting points, especially about the age of kids who play on special hockey teams, lol. It made you think a lot about your own circumstances. Perhaps it would have made a better short story?<br /><br />Diana rates 3.5 out of 5, but I had to round up to 4 :P
0738711500|4.0|This is the first tarot deck I have owned and I am right in love with the imagery.  It is stunningly beautiful, richly coloured and - I think - ideal to learn on.  My only complaint (and it's a minor one) is that the book's descriptions could've been a little more elaborative.  At least a lengthier summary of each of the suits, the Aces, Twos, Threes, etc., and most especially each of the types of Court cards.  These confuse the heck out me.    But you could google any of the card names and easily come up with wiki definitions of the meanings of them, so as I said, it's a minor complaint.  Overall, the cards are fantastic and a great introduction to Tarot.
1400064287|5.0|Sticky ideas that capture the imaginations of people and thrive aren't necessarily the best or truest ones- they're the best communicated ones! (And even the greatest ideas won't make it if they're not communicated well!) That's what this book sets out to prove and then sets out to teach you a formula for making any idea you want to communicate more powerful!<br /><br />This book is truly enjoyable. It's like eating a fun, delicious and nutritious meal for your brain.  (But, don't let the nutritious part scare you- there's nothing a bit boring or dull about it).  It's filled with entertaining real-life examples, applicable research and quick interactive \\"try it yourself\\" exercises that keep you turning the pages.<br /><br />The hardest part for me, was that I occassionally found myself cringing when reading it and thinking about some of the presentations and marketing pieces I'd once created.  I could clearly see how those I'd done that \\"didn't work\\" (or \\"stick\\") unknowingly didn't follow the guidelines. (Of course, fortunately, with others the opposite was also true.)<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Want to enjoy yourself while learning how to communicate any idea more powerfully? Read this book.
B000ZINGIK|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  I listen to it every day. I thought the metal opera 1 & 2 were the best, but i prefer this one.
B0010VD7EO|1.0|I don't agree with all the hype about this album- in a word it is very disappointing. Electric feel is probably one of two songs on the entire album that is worth mentioning, the other one being the opening Time to Pretend.  I consider myself an audiophile so I have given this album plenty of listening time, but at the end of the day it just blows and I find myself skipping petty much all of the tracks.  At times I do detect some references to such great icons of music as Bowie, Pink Floyd, and Neil Young but any serious music fan, I believe, would shudder to even mention them in the same sentence-leave it to the big boys MGMT!  Proof (like Sex and the City) that not everything that comes from NYC is good!   I want my money back and the precious time I wasted waiting for this crap album to get better.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|Aeon Flux is the 2005 film based on the early 90s animated shorts and late 90s half hour eps;and quite ride it is.I highly recommend the Aeon Flux animated collection also available,but do not try to compare the two.The movie(like any anime'to film property)is a palatable(dressed down)version of the animated series,with the action in the animated series much richer and heavier in content than its' movie counterpart.But that doesn't mean there's not alot to recommend here.<br />The story is set in the year 2011 and the  walled-in city Bregna,is host to earths' last surviving population.A plague 400 years ago left the survivors sterile and the Goodchild Research Foundation now runs the city with an iron hand.It is in turn run by its' name sake brothers Trevor(Marton Csokas,Borias from Xena) and Oren(John Miller).<br />But something strange is happening to many of the citys' citizens.Besides a myriad of daily disappearances,many of its' citizens who meet perfect strangers have inexplicable remnant memories of them;some good,some bad.<br />Our heroine Aeon Flux(Charlize Theron)is part of a rebel group called The Monacans who are fighting to end the Goodchild regime,by any means.Monacans are genetically and drug enhanced humans with superior strength and speed.They also can contact one another and/or their leader \\"The Handler\\"(Frances McDormand) psychically.Aeon is first given the job of sabotaging the security system which she accomplishes with little problem.On her way to meet her sister she sees her being carried out dead on a stretcher.Aeon wants and gets her revenge as her next assignment is to kill Trevor Goodchild.Making her way through many extremely difficult defences she manages to penetrate the Citadel where she finds Trevor rehearsing a speech.As she approaches him he turns,recognizes her and says the name of \\"Catherine\\".She also vaguely recognizes something in him but it is too late and her hesitation causes her to be caught.Not for long as she escapes and returns to meet with Trevor.They make love and after a brief sleep Aeon wakes up and chokes Trevor to near death.She leaves and realizes that her answer may lay in an object that circles the city in the sky called the\\"Relico\\".It is a flying ship supposedly built to remind the inhabitants of their sacrifices but she thinks there is more to it.She gets aboard and finds out the whereabouts of her sister and leaves.Trevor who has followed behind now knows what she was after and finds out even more information he didn't know of.He meets Aeon at the location of her sister to find that the sister is now a baby.Trevor reveals that she has been cloned;in fact everyone has been cloned over the past 400 years.He also says the real reason her sister was killed was that she was pregnant,naturally.Nature has found a cure on its own for the sterile plagued society and Trevors'brother Oren wants to keep the information from getting out,thus all the kidnappings,disappearances and deaths.Oren has also condemned Trevor to death as a traitor for sleeping with Aeon and both are now wanted fugitives.Aeon herself has also been handed a death sentence seperately by her own Monacan organization for not carrying out her mission.After a bloodied battle with Oren's forces who fight not only Trevor and Aeon but other Monacan snipers,the two barely escape with their lives.Aeon again climbs aboard the \\"Relico\\" and blows the ship up,sending it crashing into  a section of city wall and exposing the outside forested world to the startled inhabitants.The citizens now free of the Goodchild oppression can now start to live their lives anew.<br />The film is filled with spectacular stunts and CGI effects throughout and some sequences are amazing to watch.One especially delightful sequence is with a friend,the hand-footed Zathandra,as they attempt to cross the rolling grassy landscape towards the Citadel.With incredible jumps by the pair punctuated by deadly gourds with shooting syringes of poison and thegrass,which becomes seemingly alive when a human presence is detected-going from blades of grass to razor sharp blades of steel.<br />It is certainly both an aural and visual feast to be sure.But the plot keeps you intrigued and interested,I found,throughout the picture with very few let ups.And more importantly this film is one you can watch over and over and still find something just a little different each time.<br />The picture here is top notch,crisp and clear all the way and with that wonderful sound available in D/Surround 5.1 or 2.0.<br />The special features abound:Commentary by Theron and producer Gale Hurd or by co-writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi,\\"Creating a World:Aeon Flux\\"(20 m),\\"Location of AF\\"(15m),\\"Stunts of AF\\"(9m),\\"Costume Design Workshop of AF\\"(13m),\\"Craft of the set Photographer\\"(3m) and trailers.<br />All in all this DVD is a worthy addition to anyone's movie library.It's a very engaging Sci-Fi concept brought to the big screen via its' animated roots and one you can watch again and again.omes seemingly alive when a human

B000002KBU|5.0|Song for song her best compiled all on one album. Her emotions jump off the tracks into your emotions. From free-spirited to despondant. Just her best before she got commercialized.
078322737X|4.0|Like Grease, this is a generational classic captured in the wild by George Lucas. I was in high school in 1962 and my brother was away at college.<br />He had a purple hot rod Mercury that got stolen in '62.<br />For us this was a movie about the end of childhood.<br />Rock and Roll will always be deep in our hearts.<br />Wolfman Jack was a real disk player in the 60's the LA area:<br />I had a friend in college who was devoted to his show.<br />The Viet Nam war changed everything...<br />The Beatles replaced Elvis and we couldn't afford the gas for muscle cars after '75. I didn't see this movie when it came out, but heard a lot about it.<br />It was good for the hot rod business of old classic cars that my Dad the hot rodder had.<br />The past is gone: we have to face the present, but I still loved this movie.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|This is a great concert. I was no particular fan of Beyonce before but after seeing this concert I am a big fan now.  Check it out.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is definatly a kick your butt work out. I love it! is is a 20min work out that you feel working INSTANTLY. It has been a week and I am still on level one. BUT I love it! and totally recommend it to anyone who wants/needs to work out but has very little room in their schedual
B0000070QN|5.0|If in this world would be Justice, Harem Scarem would be remembered as one of the greatest bands ever instead of an obscure canadian hair metal band. If this would be a world of justice this would have been one of the best selling albums ever because it's absolutly fabolous. Impressive, exceptional, out of this world anthemic rock music, memorable in every single note. It's simply perfect. I had the bad luck to discover this album lately, because in the nineties even if I was very much in love with this genre of music, the fact that this band has never been distributed in the US took to the bad thing that the albums from the band have been relatively difficult to find. In my home town I never encountered their albums. But when one of my friends turned me onto this album few years back I became immediatly one of its loyal recommenders. It's beautiful beyond imagination, it's impossible to point out a tune or two because every tune is way over 10 cum laude. My personal favourites are \\"There was a time, \\"No justice in the world\\", the opener \\"Saviours never cry\\", but really, this is one of those albums that you start listening once and end a couple of years later. It's impossible not to love this album, not to fall in it and finding it hard to come out and listen to something else. Perfect music.
B001U8ZSCG|2.0|Simply put, the majority of the songs chosen for the film take viewers too far out of the story. Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" and the use of Philip Glass' \\"Pruit Igoe & Prophecies\\" were truly inspired choices, but it ends about there. I may lose cool points from the music snobs for saying this, but not only was the use of \\"Hallelujah\\" in the film an awkward choice of music, the Leonard Cohen version gave the impression that two people decided to consummate their relationship at a Karaoke bar. Several of the song choices seemed as though a survey went around asking High School students what song would be cool in a movie like this (I do know, having read the book, that \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" was needed in the soundtrack). Overall, minus the two aforementioned choices, the songs in \\"Watchmen\\" fall flat in the depth and thoughtfulness when compared with the story being told.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Been a fan since Badmotorfinger and just like Chris I am not stuck in the past.  Love the old music still but I also like a great deal of the new music he has released.  I think these new tunes are catchy and fun pop music not cheesy.  I love the song Time.  This will be great biking music.  Open your minds people.  The new music is fun.
B00007AJF8|4.0|This movie kind of reminded me of Kafka for some reason:<br />no offense, but $200<br />for 15 minutes of being John Malkovich<br />seems over priced?<br />The acting is first rate and the script is is just kind of awesome in the way you get to hate the John Cusack character who is<br />pretty much the anti-hero of this modern surreal drama.<br />In the end I guess I liked it, but I wouldn't take kids to see it.
B0000A118M|5.0|I've been a jazz listener 95% of my life.  My parents were listeners and this predominated most of my listening.    I have heard pieces of this MASTERPIECE more than enough times through my life time to know that I truly love this CD.    Coltrane out did himself with this and I am proud to be an owner of both the vinyl and CD.  \\"Acknowlegement\\" is the name of the first song on this CD and he start the music off with the quintesencial ringing of the gong in \\"D\\" I believe.  This prepares the listener for what is yet to come. The song directly following is very appropriately names \\"Pursuance\\", which is apparent in the style which he plays.  The CDs makes it apparent that Coltrane really had reached the zenith of his career.    Anyone that doesn't like this CD well all I can say is, listen again just to be sure you've not missed something.
B0002BO05S|5.0|It's great. Every time I watch it, I learn something new. I'm very happy with it.Thankyou so much!
B001FBSMF8|4.0|For months now I've been hearing rock fans complaining about how this album sucks and that they don't know what's happened to Cornell.  I personally like this album. I like the experimentation, and like that Cornell has gone for different sounds on all the albums he's worked on since Soundgarden broke up.  I've known, over the years, that many rock fans are closed-minded people who want their rock \\"pure.\\" Nevermind that their notion of what rock is is very unpure and based in faulty notions of ownership.  There's long been a divide between rock and rap fans, despite Run-DMC breaking down some doors with Aerosmith's Walk This Way.  I'm a fan of many styles of music, from many continents, in various languages, from various decades, and I like that Cornell made this album.  It's alienating people and perhaps that's a good thing.  Those who don't like this album don't have to listen. That's fine they don't like it, I'm not going to twist their arms to get them to like it or love it.  But I sense that many of them have any knowledge or understanding or rap or R&B. They simply don't like them. They cling to their peers, they cling to their rock and don't try out different styles.  This album's for people like me, who dig the club scene, who dig hip-hop beats. There's not one song I don't like on \\"Scream.\\"  Cornell's singing fits well with each set of Timbaland's futuristic beats.  I especially enjoy the meshing of styles that would seem ill fits on the track \\"Sweet Revenge.\\"  Even when Cornell sings in a deeper tone, it still works.   This album may alienate both rock and hip-hop fans, who knows? But I can still see the youths raised on hip-hop dancing to these songs in clubs.  I'll let the \\"pure\\" rock fans stew in their juices, meanwhile I nod my head and move.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I'm going to try to keep this short since I loved both the book and the film. If you're familiar with the novel do know that John Ajdive Lindgvist who wrote both the novel and screenplay excised a lot of the more horrific stuff from the film. Also gone was the humor involving Tommy the stoner kid who takes to harassing his soon to be stepfather while the turning of Virginia is shorter and sweeter in a way. One of the strong points of Tomas Alfredson's film is just how subtle it is in telling the story of how a bullied twelve year old forms a relationship with a child vampire. Theres not a lot of frentic camera movement and editing with some nice long shots combined with superb image composition. While Eli described in the book is almost animalistic when she needs to feed the film seems to have two people playing her at times while hinting at her power through small shots. It also smartly plays up something not really done in the book with Eli's view towards killing people and how she uses Hakan not only as a caretaker but as a willing person to collect blood. I won't describe anymore but the ending while not unfortunately having a scene where Eli needs to be invited in to save Oskar from bullies, is simpler and more brutal in a way. If I had one complaint its a small one involving the fate of Hakan that isn't really given a good explanation. Other than that everything makes this a perfect horror film in my opinion.   The DVD as it is has excellent picture but doesn't feature a whole lot in the way of extras. Theres a making of where Alfredson basically talks for ten minutes on the making of. Theres six deleted scenes and after that a picture gallery and poster gallery. I'm kind of disappointed that the disc defaults to an English dub but other than that with the price and the availabilty I do hope people check this one out before the American remake comes out. I'm reserved in my judgement of that film but this one is a classic of the genre.
B001R0KH3W|5.0|I have been WONDERing for years...why no Stevie Wonder live dvd? The wait is over..and this is a brilliant collection of old and new...stunning back up band....a wildly enthusiastic crowd and a hi-def WONDER!  I could quibble about a song choice here or there but for goodness sake...this is one of the great WONDERS in the history of music so 5 stars is still not enough.  Great camera work, great sound, did I mention  the stellar back up 14 piece band?    The opening number Miles Davis' \\"All Blues\\"  which finds Stevie playing it on harmonica is enough to  warrant the purchase...he is as much a virtuoso on  that as Miles was on trumpet...maybe greater.    I am listening/watching to him sing \\"Isn't she Lovely\\" right now...and I truly have goose bumps!    I could have lived with a bit less audience participation ...which would make a CD of this  less enjoyable...but that is a minor  quibble.  the BLu-ray and regular DVD feature the  same menu and options (I bought both so I  could watch away from my big  screen) so enjoy at  long last Stevie Wonder live!!!!!
B001R0KH3M|5.0|I purchased the Stevie Wonder - Live At Last yesterday and I have to say that finally Motown stepped up and put together a great DVD featuring one of the great pioneers of our musical time.  Simply one of the best from beginning to end.  My all time favorite song is also featured on this DVD \\"Visions\\", I went to see Stevie in concert this last year in Philadelphia, and I would have to say that the picture quality and the surround 5.1 DTS sound made me feel like I was at the concert all over again at a reasonable price.  I was also amazed at how wonderful Stevie's daughter sounds on her solo.  All in all....this is definately a classic DVD with all of his favorite songs, from \\"I Wish\\", \\"All I Do\\", \\" \\"As\\", \\"Don't You Worry About A Thing\\", \\"Superstition\\", \\"Overjoyed\\" to the all time classic \\"Lately\\".  Truly a must have for any music lover and keep in mind that after almost 6 decades....Stevie Wonder is still selling out arena not only in this country....but around the world.  If you've never been to a Stevie Concert.....sit back, relax and enjoy this 2 hour DVD concert....you may never get a chance to enjoy great music like this again, so don't take it forgranted.  Just simply enjoy and again....thanks Stevie and Motown.....You both finally got it right!!!!!
B000PTYPAC|4.0|Paramore's sophomore album is definitely worth buying. It isn't as great as all my friends said it was, but I liked it a lot. It has a very fast feel, but the songs tend to blend together after a while, so it took a couple of listens for me to really like it. Some of my favorite songs are \\"Fences\\", \\"Misery Business\\", and \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic.\\" They each have strong choruses, verses, EVERYTHING! And I love the lyrics. My least favorites were \\"When It Rains\\" and \\"Let The Flames Begin.\\" \\"When It Rains\\" was a slow song, which I love, but it just didn't stick well. And \\"Let The Flames Begin\\" is basically a crappy version of \\"For A Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic.\\" But I still sing along to every song, totally worth it.
B0000041Z3|2.0|The 4th symphony by Maazel and the VPO has always been one of my favorites. The CD reproduction proposed here is particularely bad, overworked by computarized \\"enhancements\\". Th wonderful sound of the original has become thick, heavy, with no space. What a pitty. Compare with the BELART CD to undersd what I mean, which is not yet perfect, but already much better if I tack the vynil as a reference.

Ariely's book, and others like it that come from the field of behavioral economics say, \\"Not so.\\"  What appear to be rational decisions are in fact irrational, but predictable decisions, made using other, subconcious criteria.  For example, we may choose a menu based not on our desire to receive the greatest culinary pleasure possible, but from a desire to appear unique in the eyes of our fellow diners.  Though most of us may not steal $10.00 from the company's petty cash drawer, many of us will take home office supplies that may add up to that amount or more.  We also make decisions based on relative value, and may travel 5 miles to save $10 off a $100 product, but will not travel the same distance to save $10 of a $1,000 item.  Go figure.    Ariely's accounts are mostly, though not all, fascinating.  I found the study of how college men are more likely to engage in risky or immoral behavior when sexually aroused somewhat of a no-brainer.  I also found the discussion about the implications for public policy somewhat weak and fuzzy, and wished that the author had offered more solid proposals.    In the end, however, Predictably Irrational has fascinating information about how we ultimately make decisions.  Knowing these cognitive flaws could help each of us think ahead and compensate so as to imrpove our decision-making ability.
0060558121|5.0|I really enjoyed this surprisingly epic novel. It had such a fascinating premise! I liked the whole idea of mythology-brought-to America and how it played out. I felt a bit disappointed about Shadow, but that really proved just how sympathetic and likable Gaiman's characters are. And even that disappointment wasn't enough to detract from my enjoyment of the book as a whole. Really, it was just fascinating - and such an engrossing read. It had such vivid imagery - it was just terrific!! I read [[ASIN:0380789019 Neverwhere]] quite a few years ago, but after finishing this one, I am looking forward to re-visiting it and discovering other books by this very talented author!
0743496736|5.0|I must say that this book differs from my usual tastes of urban fantasy and the supernatural genre,but in a good way. From the opening paragraph on I found myself completely immersed in the lives of the characters in this book.<br /><br />Who would expect a story about a school shooter to be so compelling? But it was. Where other writers seem to struggle with point of view and moving between present and past, Picoult showed no such difficulties.<br /><br />I found myself reading as many as 100 pages a day to get to the gripping conclusion.<br /><br />The story is about a boy named Peter Houghton, who snaps one day and kills 10 people and injures 19 more. The town is heart broken and grief striken as they try to figure out what happened. Picoult takes us back all the way to the beginning and works her way up to the trial, which was when I REALLY couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I found myself asking myself some really hard questions. I will definatley be reading more of this writer. Well worth the 5 stars!
0316779237|5.0|After finishing a depressing novel, I know that I can always rely on Sedaris to bring a smile to my face. I just knew it would be a fast and fun read! I love David Sedaris' books, and though I knew this collection included some essays that are published elsewhere, I really looked forward to the new essays. I was a little disappointed that the three new essays were fiction, but they are still very funny. I just prefer the stories about his family, like \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" but I really did enjoy \\"Front Row and Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" quite a bit! I hear there is another, more recently  updated version of this book out and now and it has even more new material, so I will have to get around to picking that up!

B001UOVP1S|3.0|Fans of Chris Cornell's previous solo work may be disappointed by this album or at least slightly shocked as it takes a very different approach to music. Soundgarden or Audioslave fans, or any rock/grunge fans may feel equally let down. In fact, anyone with any expectations may well feel that way.    Expectations aside, this is an album with a strong R&B feel to it and you can notice Timbaland's presence throughout. There are 14 tracks (15 on amazon exclusive; 16 on iTunes) on the album that is just more than an hour long. The first time I listened to it, I felt the album was over too quickly. I think partly this has to do with the pop or uptempo production of the album; the drums and synthesizer on most of the tracks are fast-paced and can be catchy at times. But part of it can also be attributed to a lack of the traditional rock sound associated with Chris Cornell (no blaring intros, no guitar solos, etc.)     What stands out most about the album is that Cornell doesn't try to model the current pop music sound in his singing but rather does it his own way. The result is often that you hear powerful, measured vocals over some fast and seemingly chaotic beats. Cornell plays with this fast and slow dynamic throughout the album and essentially that is the soul of Scream.    Part of Me (5:14)  This song starts out slow - and very quiet too, I thought it wasn't playing for the first few seconds or so - but sets the mood immediately. Until he starts singing, this doesn't feel like a Cornell album. The chorus is quite catchy and you might even hear this one at the club. In terms of lyrics, this isn't one of Cornell's strongest pieces but you may find some familiar concepts from music he has created in the past. Listen to Soundgarden's Fresh Deadly Rarities and some things might jump out at you. In fact, I felt that to be the case through the entire album.     Time (4:39)  Time starts a few seconds before the previous track ends (the entire album is connected this way, meant to be listened as a whole maybe) and is not all that different from the first song until the interlude. Cornell cited a Pink Floyd or Queen type of a psychedelic sound to some of the album and this is probably one of those tracks.    Sweet Revenge (4:10)  I listened to this album continuously for several hours and I missed the beginning of this song each time. You notice the new track however, when Cornell starts singing. This is fastest sung on this album but it also immediately reminded me of Cornell's cover of Billie Jean. I think a Timbaland produced cover of the Micheal Jackson song might have fit the album well. In other tracks, you can hear Cornell hitting some high notes that are atypical of his vocal prowess, and it even seems like he is trying to emulate the king of pop.    Get Up (3:35)  This song is rare, even for this album. The lyrics almost have a pep-talk feel to them and you may even feel like sucking it up and facing the world. However, the song falls short of impressing. What seems to be a turning point (and a sound similar to Audioslave's Original Fire) turns out to be just the next song starting up.     Ground Zero (3:09)  One of the more complete songs of the album. The vocals, synth, and all the effects come together nicely as you get a break from the same drum beat carrying over the last 4 tracks. There's a lot you can take from this song and perhaps is one of the better titled songs on the album too.    Never Far Away (5:06)  I was really disappointed with this song. This might as well as be a pop number from the 90's with a slow dance sequence that won't impress many today. The lyrics are non-existent, the vocals are mellowed down, and it's just slow and drags on...at 5:06 it seems even longer compared to the rest of the songs. This could have been left out.    Take me Alive (4:36)  This song also probably doesn't belong on this album, but not because it lacks quality. It starts with an Asian/Middle-eastern riff, one might expect the Soundgarden crew to kick in any minute, and has more a psychedelic rock influence. This song is a surprise really after hearing the first half of the album. It's a welcome change and definitely worth a second listen.    Long Gone (5:15)  What seems like a nice lead into the second part of the album becomes old very quickly. There seems to be a general lack of emotion or energy (listen to Audioslave's Moth; more or less the same message but a completely different feel) and it's hard to concentrate on what Cornell has to say.    Scream (6:15)  The title track of this album is probably the most impressive and creative in terms of versatility. This song is whatever you want it to be rock, hip-hop, R&B. \\"Silence is golden\\" will probably be stuck in your head for a while. This song also introduces the power and fast-paced rhythms that see the album to it's last track. Overall the this track captures the feel of the album well.     Enemy (4:35)  Enemy is definitely a pop track but it also has everything it takes to be on this album. This is not the best song, this is not the worst song but it has the potential for a lot more. Overall, It's easy to listen to and should leave you scratching your head to figure out what other song this sounds like.     Other Side of Town (4:48)  While this generates the same \\"I've-heard-this-somewhere-before\\" feeling from the previous track you'll be left waiting for the song to begin only to realize that it's almost over. Not a bad song though, just nothing special.    Climbing Up the Walls (4:48)  It starts like too many other songs on this album but the guitar riffs take it in a different direction. This is one of the 2-3 songs I would listen to more than once on this album. It ends in an very off-beat manner but it doesn't take away from the track.    Watch Out (4:02)  It would not be inappropriate to describe this as a fun track. It's definitely fast-paced and doesn't carry the awkwardness of other tracks (like Get up or Long gone) and mademe think of the black-eyed peas a little. It is one of those tracks that can make it's way into the club though I think it would be great to rock out to in a concert as well.    Two Drink Minimum (3:02)  This track illustrates the fast and slow contract of the entire album, especially if you compare it to the previous track. Although short, this track packs in all the blues and folksy influences that Cornell has demonstrated in his work before. It feels a little forced but it's not a bad song.    It is easy to skip over most of the album, though you'd probably want to play a few tracks again. I'm not familiar with much of Timbaland's work so I won't compare it to his past work, but this isn't Cornell's best. He has proven to be versatile before and there is nothing in this album that adds to what he has already done. The original concept was pretty good, and you can listen to some of the songs again but most of the album fell short of delivering. Overall, average.
B000056BOR|5.0|Loved this Movie. Great Seller would recommend them anytime. Fast & accurate on the Movie description.    Thanks
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I cannot seem to get through this series. It is so devastating. If you're a soft-hearted animal lover or a child or otherwise...don't watch it. If you're in a depressed mood that day..stay away. Gosh, they really could've done something with this, but it is devastating to watch gostlings and caribou babies being killed in the wild..huh. Somehow, I wonder if this was not meant for us to watch in all its glory. They could've taken a different viewpoint.<br />I just couldn't stand watching it. Awful.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|after all the identity crisis in load and reload, this guys made st anger; it was decent album  (not even close to great) but it was really a re-encounter with themselves. The result is DEATH MAGNECTIC -- finally this guys came with an album that goes up with their previus work (ride, master, justice and a little bit black) In this album u hear great guitar reefs, great drums and good GUITAR SOLOS (thanks god. This is an album that really take metallica back to the top of metal. I think this album is source of the modern ride the lightning and the next one will be an modern master, this means probably the best. LISTEN AND ENJOY THIS RECORD
B001GCUER0|5.0|The second season of this AMC series is in story/character sense a lot like the second season of Sopranos was for itself. This season spends it's thirteen episodes expanding upon what has already been established at the same time as it balances sudden new story devices and taking things to their next logical (or sometimes illiogical based on the character) extensions. I found it very enjoyable and while it may not be a full reflection of life in the sixies it truly shows the aspects that it aspires to quite well and shows flawed characters who are full of unfortunate parallels with people in the world today.    This is a show that is telling a specific story while exploring specific character's in an attempt to disect certain issues within our world today. I look at this show as a reflection of recent times, the issue of never being happy with what you have and looking for happiness in the wrong places and feeling lost and unsure of your place in the world is something I see a lot of people dealing with in the world around me. The setting of the sixties is almost the perfect era to pair with such seemingly lost and depressed character's because of it's ironic nature at the same time as the literal sense of reinvention and change that occured in that time.    I feel the first season did a fantastic job of setting up this series. The second season acheived it's goal of expanding, elaborating and extending upon the world and character's we were introduced to. The third season is set up, like most shows, to take the best from the first and second seasons and finally show us a complete vision of the show without being tied down by these mandatory practices.    The second season contains the following 13 Episodes:    1 For Those Who Think Young  2 Flight 1  3 The Benefactor  4 Three Sundays  5 The New Girl  6 Maidenform  7 The Gold Violin  8 A Night to Remember  9 Sixth Month Leave  10 The Inheritance  11 The Jet Set  12 The Mountain King  13 Meditations in an EmergencyThis DVD release will be a 4-disc set presented in Anamorphic Widescreen Video, English Dolby 5.1 Audio, with Subtitles in English & Spanish along with closed captioning for the hearing impaired.     The Packaging for both the DVD and Blu-Ray is described as being \\"available as a limited-edition sleek shirt box with see through window\\".     Special Features Announced So Far Include:     -Audio Commentaries With Cast & Crew on all 13 Episodes   -\\"Birth Of An Independent Woman Parts 1 & 2\\" - Featurette examining the rise of female independence in the 60's.   -\\"An Era Of Style\\" - Featurette exploring the fashion of the 1960's and it's lasting influence on designer's today.   -\\"Time Capsule\\" - Interactive featurettes paying homage to historic events on the 1960's and the daring generation that lived through them.    I will update my review when/if any more special features or information are given closer to July, when this will be released. I will also update my review when I have actually seen the special features on the set, but for now I have seen these episodes and think there is a lot to be found here for those interested and on top of that this show looks beautiful. Thanks For Your Time.    *Rather than further clutter up this review page I have included a list of short non spoiler giving episode descriptions in my comments section for those interested.
1401219268|5.0|I'm usually quite disappointed when movies and books are hyped up to excessive amounts, but this is definitely one that made me eat my words. It fully lives up to its hype. Not your typical dumbed down graphic novel either. Steer clear if you like things spelled out for you and don't like to use your head...you people might be better off reading the Sunday Newspaper's comic strips.
B000F12OXU|5.0|I first heard this album back in 1970 and loved it then: now almost 40 years later it still sounds fresh, and is definitely the most creative effort by Deep Purple. The musicianship really stands out, and the songwriting is above average. Still one of the best heavy rock albums of all time.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|There are certain things that had to happen in this book (spoiler alert) Bella had to become a vampire, Jacob had to be taken care of and a baby was pretty much a given.    I enjoyed the book until the daughter came along.  It all went a bit fantastic after that and it never really improved.  All of Bella's struggles ended when she became a vampire and that was kind of a let down. I did not care for the ending - It seemed more like S. Meyer had to end the book and why not here.      It was definitely my least favorite in the series.
B000000OAA|5.0|This release is the definitive Queen disk, which is strong but lacks some of the more pompous releases the followed.  The opening song, \\"Brighton Rock\\" showcases Mercury's alternating falsetto (for the female part) and strong middle register (male part) for this call and reply.  The single, \\"Killer Queen\\" is a classic Mercury cut, with a brilliant lead break by May.  \\"Tenement Funster\\" is rocker penned and sung by the drummer, Roger Taylor, which segues seamlessly into \\"Flick of the Wrist\\" where Mercury's voice soars.  There is a short piano ditty, \\"Lily of the Valley\\" which runs immediately into a great May song, \\"Now I'm Here\\", which pays deference to both Mott the Hoople (\\"Down in the city just Hoople and me\\" and their billing as an opener for Mott at the Uris theatre on Broadway, NYC) and Chuck Berry (\\"Go go go little Queenie\\" at the end of the song).  The second side kicks off with \\"In the Lap of the Gods\\", which runs directly into the siren that starts \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\".  There are some interesting songs that follow \\"Bring Back Leroy Brown\\", which features a ukelele break by May near the end.  The release concludes with \\"In the Lap of the Gods (revisited)\\" which was a live showcase of Mercury's voice.  Great stuff that differentiates Queen from their contemporaries, that is a must to own.
0553384775|4.0|I again find it hard to fathom why a book or movie like this can stir up so much commotion. Your experience with this book depends entirely on your expectations and starting point.<br />If you are a stock trader or insider you might not like it as it describes the excesses in the industry, the lack of morals and often shortage of wits among the players. If you are anything but from the industry you are repulsed (or feel a need to say you are) with the lifestyles of these 20'somethings.<br /><br />I personally am not from the industry but I know many who are and whether Belfort exaggerates his stories a bit or not, I do believe the account is quite reflective of many a life in the business. I in fact found the sex stories very moderate compared to a lot I have heard over the years.<br /><br />Belfort is certainly not a literary genius but his story captivates you and it makes for excellent holiday reading. So with the right expectations you will have fun reading this book.  And his accounts as to his thinking when explaining his various not so honorable deeds will resonate in part with most men from some point of their lives - but maybe that is why it is so painful for some to read?
B001PPLIEQ|4.0|While I loved Casino Royale this film wasn't as good.  Entertaining, very new and fresh approach- as I've never seen a Bond film pick up where it left off in a previous film.  The action was good, the acting great and the story...okay.  Different, but it was a little flat.  Maybe because the running time was so short.  Casino was well over 2 hours and this one was barely over an hour and a half.  Not much wiggle room time wise.  The cast was great though.  I would recommend this, even though I wasn't quite sure how I felt about it after it ended.  I thought, before I went to see it, that I'd want to see it again.  Not so much.  It was nice because it filled in the blanks that Casino left, the whole Vesper--boyfriend being abducted...then she allows herself to drown.  The freaky dude, Mr. White.  Left me scratching my head at the end of that flick.  This answered those issues and vindicated Vesper and what Bond had with her.  Anyway, it was good.  Nothing overly special or spectacular.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|The self is not something one finds. It's something one creates.    \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" is a fun and funny satire on America's mainstream culture. Love, sex, female/male identity in search of the meaning of life, and the possibility of passion. It is definitely just a beginning of the journey. Young, we just start scratching the surface of who we are. Men are dull and women are clueless.     In an authority based society man thinks that woman knows something and waits for instructions on what to do or for an approval. Woman believes that man is in control and fight the phantom. Just like in politics we think that the government knows something or that banks are in control and pass the responsibilities to someone else. And then we suffer, and we feel sorry for ourselves and wait for something else to come alone.     In today's financial crisis, it may look like America is suffering from greed but if you get a closer look, you may see that it is more likely that we are suffering from boredom and a identity crisis.     Think about it, what would even the best of the best American men do if he did not have a \\"money game\\" or a \\"war game\\" to play? Nothing right?     So far \\"The Star Wars\\" is the only common ground for Americulture. What do we believe in besides  war? What do we stand for besides money? So, maybe by the good fortune, solving the Global Environmental crisis is the next adventure that will redefine US culture, and will give it unity.     Crisis is always a good thing.    In literature the word crisis has another name - \\"climax.\\" Climax is when the hero changes his value system through new action.     Action has been a measure of truth across all ages.     \\"Vicky-Cristina\\" is drifting, man is bored in the board room. Strangely American man will do anything to get the money but would not lift a finger to get a woman, or understand the woman, or to hold on to the woman. Who was it that said that the family is the basic unit of society and that the easiest way to change society is to change the family dynamics.     Change creates change.    To change a personal or cultural identity will take tons of self-awareness and internal power. The good news is that being a young culture, America also has all the benefits of the youth - abundant energy, flexibility, and puppy enthusiasm for the new. This time, the new is a new game, and the one who makes the new rules is the one who will lead the game.    Where is no passion there is no compassion.     We understand what we love, we love to understand. Like a soldier is never ready for peace the businessman is never ready for love.     Strangely only sex makes American man more human, and connects him to a woman. No wonder we confuse sex with connection and glue ourselves to every passer by or a computer screen.    We stroke our troubles with the feather of small talk, we afraid to cut through to the heart of the problems to split it open. We search for proof of life in money, and objects, and forget that only connected world is real.      There is a slight sense of irony in the movie: life is passing by just like a cloud on the blue sky. What would it take to bring these people to life? Maybe it will be a world economic crisis, or it could be green revolution. WiserEarth needs wiser people, just a bit more curiosity, passion and trust in its own power. Freedom simply means flexible rules and flexible actions to get what you want and know what you need. Time to raise the bar.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|There isn't a word in the English language to describe how bad and how disappointing this album is. Cornell has abandoned his fan base and defected to the sold out POP Crowd when Pop music is the enemy.  Add to that the insult of pairing with this hack Timabaland - what a joke.<br /><br />If \\"Timbaland - who calls their album \\"the best work I've done in my career\\" \\" is correct in his own assessment of his work then McDonald's is missing a fry cook. I can tell the technical work was done well in the mix. But no amount of technical expertise can compensate for mixing 1, 2 or 16 tracks of horrible sound together.  A turd with perfume on it is still a turd.<br /><br />Occasionally, and I mean rarely, you can hear the classic Cornell voice and some of the guitar that we could expect from a truly great, destined to be Rock 'n Roll hall of fame nominee Chris Cornell.  However the sounds and overly commercialized pop sound mixed in just absolutely drowns him out erasing all sense and presence of this great musician.<br />I cannot express how great the disappointment is in this album after waiting so long for it to surface.<br /><br />My recommendation is to protest this garbage and not buy it.  Demand the Cornell we all love and expect to return to what he is a Master of Rock & Roll, Grunge and Alternative.  I would rather Cornell had retired from music forever than release this sad excuse for an album.<br /><br />I am even blowing off the concert in 2 weeks because I just can't bear the idea of seeing this alleged music live.<br /><br />Chris - We love you man, but come back from the Dark Side of the evil Pop Music.<br /><br />Remember - Pop Music is the Enemy.<br /><br />Timbaland - get a real job you no talent hack, stay in your crappy genre and leave ours alone.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have had the 30 day shred for 2 months now. I am very busy with little time to spare. I do the workout 5 days a week, sometimes twice a day (once in morning and once in the evening). I take weekends off for other physical activities - running, flying kites, playing bocce). I was physically small when I began the shred - 5'4\\" 110 lbs, but now I am getting tight. I am beginning to see a 6 pack in my abs for the first time in my life. I personally think levels 1, 2 and 3 are all intense. What matters is how much intention you put into the movements.     Also, this workout is great if you have a very small space to work out in.     I will keep doing this workout, increasing the size of the hand weights, indefinitely. I love putting in 20 solid minutes and getting results. If there is any other awesome 20 minute workout on the market, I would love to know about it.     A few unsolicited tips. Five years ago, I weighed 20 pounds more than I do now. I did not go on a diet or make radical restrictions. I just gradually got healthier and my body began to change. I started working out slowly. I stopped smoking. I have always kept my face out of the sun and at 30 I get carded everytime I go to a bar or buy a bottle of wine.     Other things I have always done: I eat what I want but never eat fast food. Never. I drink 1-2 glasses of red wine on most days. No beer or liquor. No carbonated beverages ever. No sugary soft drinks ever.     And now I do the Shred 5 times a week and my body is starting to look amazing.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Hollywood hates to let a hackneyed concept go to waste and will milk one success in the genre for all it's worth.   No attempt has really been made to obscure that this Julia Roberts vehicle is an all-female remake of \\"Dead Poets Society\\" with Roberts in the Robin Williams role (unless switching the discipline of the teacher from English to art history could be called obscure.)   And, as is the case with the previous film, the young actors playing the students are far more convincing as inhabitants of an earlier period (the 1950s in both cases) than the adult leads.      In 1953, young first-year instructor Katherine Watson comes all the way from the 'progressive' Left Coast to the 'repressive' East Coast to teach art history at Wellesley College.  She lacks previous teaching experience or a doctorate and is a product of a state school, but we know from her gumption and her dazzling smile that she is eminently well-qualified for the post.  Once installed in Wellesley, she encounters the requisite stock characters:  the timid and proper colleague who teaches deportment and lives in a chitz-covered universe; the authoritarian college president; the closet lesbian (c'mon, a movie set at a girls' school needed at least one);  the dashing professor of romance languages, soon-to-be-love interest; and etc.  Ms. Watson (though several decades ahead of women's liberation, no one as spunkily single as she would deign to answer to  `Miss') gets a rude awakening during her introductory lecture when the well-bred young ladies in her course display their mastery of the text and her  rather condescending slide presentation.  The  class has lots of bodies in it, but only four that will be of concern to us:  uber-Mean Girl and debutante bride Betty (Kirsten Dunst); steady Joan (Julia Stiles, channelling an ingenue Jane Fonda); New York sophisticate (read: campus slut) Giselle (Maggie Gyllenhall) and sweet-natured, perky cellist Connie (the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin), who inexplicably can't find a boyfriend.  These four girls are roommates; when not sniping at Ms. Watson in class, they snipe at each other in the dorm.  A lot of sniping goes on, but it's always the well-modulated, grammatically correct kind.        The plot requires the free-thinking Ms. Watson to be a fish out of water whose `unorthodox' methods promptly  have her at odds with the college administration and her students, too, who have reason to be distrustful of this Callifornia bohemian out to sabotage their dreams of matrimonial utopia.  We know that Ms. Watson is a bohemian because she wears palazzo pants, embroidered peasant blouses and a beret.  Roberts looks great in whatever she wears, but her wardrobe looks much more 1980s than 1950s, even for a bohemian.  With her flowing red mane and toothy smile, she suggests (and maybe is meant to) Katherine Hepburn, who played sassy career women years before the period the movie is set in. (and also favored roomy trousers.)   Alas, Julia Roberts might have the look, but does not have the chops to channel Hepburn; her inspirational lectures sound most often like preachy harangues.   Ms. Watson is a fraud, but a well-connected one: in one scene she gets her class on the scene at the precise moment the newest Jackson Pollack is being uncrated.  Those California bohemians evidently know people.      The action covers an entire academic year at Wellesley; a lot of stuff happens, all of it designed to hammer home the theme that Conformity is Bad and Individualism is good.  Individualism in this case means eschewing  marriage and family in order to attend graduate school and presumably stride around in palazzo pants.  By transposing 21st century mores onto Roberts' character, she is rendered a complete anachronism.  Ms. Watson might as well be an attractive alien visiting from 50 years in the future, ie. 2003--that's how authentic she feels as an inhabitant of the Eisenhower era.  The young actresses, by contrast, disappear  into the costumes and manners of 1950s undergraduates hot in pursuit of an M.R.S. degree with more ease.  They are the reason to watch this movie, along with some beautiful cinematography (much of it was shot on the Wellesley campus) and meticulous attention to period detail.  The soundtrack has some great numbers, but underscoring each new scene with a different 1950s pop hit begins to feel transparent very shortly.  This film is lovely to look at, but ultimately superficial.  A 1950s-era drama that manages to be respectful of its period while at the same time underscoring its limitations with more resonance is \\"Far From Heaven\\" starring Julianne Moore.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|I've always dug Prodigy, and there's been a distinct switch up in style since \\"Music for the Jilted Generation.\\" The switch from more of a techno style into an electronic punk rock route. Both sound awesome. This album sounds like the child of both... imagine a more punk style \\"Out of Space\\" and other classics. Great album!
1416511946|3.0|After reading and enjoying The Dirt I decided to get Heroin Diaries but it fell below my expectations (which doesn't mean I didn't like it), as most, if not all, of the material is covered in Nikki Sixx's chapters in The Dirt. There's barely anything new and it turns very repetitive after a while. Also, some of the parts, like when Sixx introduces Vanity or talks about Dickinson's wife, seem to be against the nature of journal writing, but I guess it had to be done to give the book more sense.     The updated comments for the characters involved saved the book as they added fresh and interesting insights that were not presented in The Dirt. My favorite part were the last pages where full of optimism Nikki looks into his present and future and concludes he's still as rock n' roll as ever. You truly are a rock 'n roller, Nikki!    On a side note, I found it hilarious when Nikki related Orwell's Animal Farm to Motley Crue. It looks like the whole concept behind the book went over Sixx's head. I guess it makes sense considering the state he was into at the time.    As a Motley Crue fan I am glad that Nikki has his life on track and is channeling all his energy into productive endeavors, e.g. Running Wild in The Night.     I'd recommend this book, but only for die-hard, Motley fans.
B000BT97AO|5.0|While this may seem like another simple Alice in wonderland knock off, it is far from being that. It is a beautiful, well cast, brilliantly crafted film with mind blowing visuals, original characters, concepts, creatures and effects that all mix into a truly unique film. It all flows wonderfully together with charming, relatively unknown actors and the story is simple yet pleasing, creative and enjoyable for all kinds of ages and minds. An under appreciated and over looked movie that definitely deserves your attention, check it out I SWEAR you will not be disappointed.

B00005JPY2|5.0|PURE BRILLIANCE!!  And dare I say it??  BETTER than the book!<br />Oh geez, I can already sense the comic book purists ready to crucify me.  Relax dudes, stop hyperventilating, wipe the fog from your glasses.  This is just my opinion, and I can say with no hesitation--this film is top-notch, quite possibly even better than the graphic novel!  I think they are both remarkable achievements, of course, but the movie does surpass the book in one major area.  More on that later.<br /><br />Okay, I'm aware of Mr. Moore taking his name off the credits.  That move really makes no sense to me.  Mainly because I am fairly certain he received a fat paycheck for the rights to this story.  If he felt so strongly against any deviation to his artistic vision, he should have stood adamant with his original writing.<br /><br />Now, I am usually the first to diss Hollywood.  I still loathe the changes they made to the great comic book series WANTED.  But some alterations can be good, remember the novel adaptation of THE SHINING?  Some people will criticize something just because it strays from the version they were expecting.<br /><br />And for those who say this movie doesn't capture the emotional capacity of the book--I say BULLOCKS!!!  This movie is packed with excellent depictions of fear, anger, confusion, regret, lust, sadness, apathy, humor, anxiety, sarcasm, pain....seriously, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more thorough psychological examination at the theater.  This is humanity exposed, inside and out.<br /><br />I imagine the harshest criticism for this film is due to the ending.  Zack Snyder does stay EXTREMELY close to the book until the climax.  I am totally surprised to say that I loved it!  It was a small alteration, but made a big difference.  The change was just plain brilliant, plus it made perfect sense with this story.  Really, think about it--would the director make such a drastic change to the end of the most celebrated graphic novel of all time if he wasn't positive of the results?  I think not.<br /><br />WATCHMEN is easily the best film so far this year.  Along with THE DARK KNIGHT and IRON MAN, it's amazing to see the genre rise above the label of popcorn entertainment.  This most likely won't appeal to the masses.  Kudos to the cast and crew for their stellar efforts.not.    WATCHMEN is easily the best film so far this year.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|... on its own merits. Musically, I give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars to help balance out some of the silly 1 star reviews, and because at $2.99 this is a steal of a deal. Anyone paying attention at all knew this album would be nothing like Soundgarden or Audioslave; anyone the least bit acquainted with Timbaland had to know this wouldn't feature grunge, metal, or any sort of guitar-oriented sound. So criticizing it for not sounding like Cornell's previous work only goes so far, which is not far at all. It has to be judged on its own merits, no matter how long of a shadow is cast by Cornell's previous work.    Having now listened to the album start to finish a few times, I can see why Cornell insisted in interviews that it needed to be heard as an album to be fairly judged. It really does flow nicely and the transitions are often quite clever. Repeated listens reveal a lot of detail as well as some excellent grooves. While there has always been, for good reason, much attention paid to Cornell's one-of-a-kind vocals, this album, to my ears, brings out his ability to write urban/r&b-flavored pope tunes with strong hooks and multi-layered harmonies. I recall Steve Lillywhite (who produced \\"Carry On\\") remarking on how impressed he was with Cornell's ability to come up with unusual and excellent harmonies; that ability is used well throughout this album, often creating a lush wall of sound.     The only song I really don't care for is the first cut, \\"Part of Me,\\" with its rather inane chorus (although the first 45 seconds are creepy-fun, as if announcing, \\"Get ready for something different!\\"). Somewhat surprisingly, the album gets stronger as it goes on; the second half is especially excellent.     One aspect of this album that I appreciated is that it reveals the more quirky, off-beat side of Cornell. I'm a huge fan of \\"Superunknown\\" and \\"Down on the Upside,\\" but the intense and sometimes dour nature of those albums can become a bit unrelenting. It seems to methat with \\"Scream\\" Cornell was able to explore song structures, sounds, themes, and ideas that he couldn't in previous contexts. While many fans will have a hard time letting go of \\"Chris Cornell, Grunge/Rock God,\\" it is quite apparent that Cornell himself has little use for such mythological, nostalgic nonsense. The fact is, if he continued to put out hard rock/metal-ish albums, he would likely be widely mocked for not letting go of his glory days and for re-treading familiar sounds/themes. He is not, of course, above legitimate criticism, but I don't think calling him a \\"sell out\\" or pining for \\"Superunknown II\\" forms the basis for such criticism for anyone who appreciates pop/rock music in general and Cornell's talents in particular.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|Lés Miserables is simply the best musical ever. The universal themes that run through it are really philosophical. Almost all the music and lyrics are great. It is beautiful except for the Thénardiers' songs; the musical really paints the portrait of this ugly couple well through, well, kind of ugly songs.    I've only heard this particular \\"Dream Cast\\" performance. Javert I think is excellent, and M. Thénardier (\\"Master of the house\\") is perfect for his part.    This product could really have been improved by having the lyrics written in the booklet.

B001KP2Y3K|5.0|I love the music of Madelenie Peyroux.  She could literally sing the phone book, and I would love it.  Her voice is so soothing and pleasant.  She is definitely one of my favorite singers of any genre.  My favorite track is \\"I Must Be Saved\\".  It is a love song for anyone who has been in a relationship who has lost something.  She displays her skill on the acoustic guitar on this track.  I love the musical arrangement of the title track so much.  She creates unforgettable images in this song.  She makes drinking a warm bottle of whiskey in a ditch sound poetic.  \\"Our Lady Of Pigalle\\" is a romantic song about the life of a lady of the night in Paris.  I love this song.  The guitar playing is beautiful. Madelenie shows some feistiness on the track \\"You Can't Do Me\\".  I love to hear a different side to her.  Another highlight is the song \\"To Love You All Over Again\\".  The piano playing by Jim Beard is lovely here.  I love the bass playing by Larry Klein on the track \\"River Of Tears\\". \\"Instead\\" is a groovy song.  It is a reminder to look on the bright side of life.  I like the interesting perspective that she provides on the track \\"Homeless Happiness\\".  Bare Bones is one of my favorite discs of the year.

When she sings &#34;Papa, do you hear me&#34; when she is on her way to &#34;school&#34; it tears your heart out, but when she sings it on the ship at the end, it is a song of triumph!!!!  I think she is the most under rated performer of our time!!!!

She doesn't enjoy reading and we are preparing for a very long trip. This will help make the trip a little easier for all. I have always enjoyed these books, so listening to them will bring them to life.
B0006399FS|3.0|After immediately falling in love with NLOTH, I remember my feelings when listening to this album for the first time. I was greatly disappointed. I was like WTF? However after listening to the album several more times, it grew on me. My biggest problem with the album is that several songs seem to be just filler.     Positive Thoughts:    The first 6 tracks are great! I really like \\"Miracle Drug\\". IMHO, this song is the most underrated song on the album. I love this song!     \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is another song that is great! It is even better live!    \\"One Step Closer\\" is a slow song that I really like.     \\"Yahweh\\" is the best closing song since \\"40\\". This song is great and ends the album well.    Negative thoughts:    \\"A Man And A Woman\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", and \\"Original Of The Species\\" are boring. I found these tracks to be uninspired, lazy, and just bland! These songs should have been B-sides.    Other Songs that would have been better choices, IMHO opinion would have been: \\"Are You Gonna Wait Forever\\" a B-Side from the Vertigo Single. \\"Smile\\", \\"Fast Cars\\", or \\"Love You Like Mad\\" would have made a more interesting album for me. \\"A Man And A Woman\\", \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\", and \\"Original Of The Species\\" were just filler!

B0015XWUC2|2.0|I bought this album on vinyl when it first was released in 1987.  LOVED it.  I eventually wanted to get this album in digital format, so I purchased this CD.  Boy, what a mistake.  The whole selling point on CDs was to enjoy the clean crisp sound that digital format allowed, but with this particular CD, that is not the end result.  Gone was the big voice that Rick Astley became known for and instead were these muted lyrics that you could sing along with but didn't have any faint resemblance to the great 80's sound that you know and love.  This CD's audio was hollow and at times, sounded like it was coming from the next room over.  There is nothing wrong with Rick Astley or his music, but this CD's format was poor, disappointing, and left me wondering if I had imagined it all.  Not the case.  I purchased a UK import \\"Together Forever: The Best of Rick Astley\\" from Amazon and while I had to wait a bit for its delivery, it was worth it!  The vocal strength of Rick Astley came through crystal clear.  You will probably play this CD maybe once and then you'll go looking for better sound quality elsewhere.<br /><br />Knightmessenger pointed out that: \\"Amazon lists 3 releases of this album. One from 1990, one from 2008 and an expanded 2 disc one that has alternate mixes from 2010. Your review showed up in multiple releases so I was wondering if you knew more about the different editions and which one you purchased. I could understand a CD sounding poor if it came out in 1990 but I would expect a recent one to sound up to standard.\\"<br /><br />I tried to find out what the date was when my version was pressed, but all references now point to the current Rick Astley listing that shows April 8, 2008. All the dates referenced on the actual CD and its insert are the original recording date (1987). I'm sorry, but I am unable to determine when my particular CD version was pressed/released.  I'd be interested to know because I would love to have this album and be able to listen to it!<br /><br />J. Lynch suggested: \\"...Perhaps you need to turn the volume up a bit (since this will be very quiet compared to CDs from about '96 onward), or maybe you have a different version of the CD than I.\\"  The first suggestion fails to be helpful and the second one doesn't seem to reflect that the realization of different versions has been made in previous comments.ed: \\"...Perhaps you need to turn the volume up a bit (since this will be very quiet compared to CDs from about '96 onward), or maybe you have a different version of the CD than I.\\"  The first suggestion fails to be helpful and the second one doesn't seem to reflect that the realization of different versions has been made in previous comments.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|On the face of it, this British made film (winner of a best picture Oscar) sounds a terrible mixture of unbelievable melodrama, full of improbable coincidences, and western condescension. A teenage boy, raised on India's awful slums, manage to win millions in a tacky quiz show by answering all the questions, neither of them terrible hard. He knows the answers, not from having read about them, but from having learned in life about them (for example, he knows who invented the revolver from a shootout he was once involved). From the first scene, where the protagonist is tortured with electric wires to find out if he's a cheat, to the very end, when his lifelong female friend crosses a busy street to reach a cell phone in order to tell him in extremis the answer that will let him win the show, the whole film is ridiculous, sentimental, manipulative, condescending...and yet, this film is nowhere as bad as it sounds, and despite all its low punches, it is eminently watchable. Maybe this has to do with the actor's earnest performances, but this film ends up reaching a deeper emotional chord than it should have. Recommended with reservations.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|Cornell has unveiled a fresh new sound and approach to his music throughout this album.     While Scream may put off those who prefer his Soundgarden or Audioslave rock sound; those who love his vocals and creativity, and have an open mind, should be intrigued at the new approach.     The Timbaland beats combined with Chris' amazing vocals result in something truly unique and completely refreshing -- not quite rock, not quite hip hop, just something purely it's own.     I particularly love the songs \\"Enemy,\\" \\"Get Up,\\" and \\"Scream.\\"

B0013FFMOK|3.0|Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \\"The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization.\\"  I never read the book that inspired this movie, but I am a Will Smith fan and he delivered again in this movie.  I seen the movie in the theater and bought the DVD...so why the 3 star rating?  The problem set I Am Legend presented was very intriguing to me; however, I don't buy into the idea of super human zombie's or any scenario where a person's physiology is suddenly altered.  But...Society is very dependent on infrastructure; in this movie the main character is surviving in an environment not devastated by manmade or natural destruction; what's left I Am Legend is a world that still appears the same but without human presence.  Watching Smith recover and use the resources available and/or left behind, and his way of dealing with isolation from human interaction was appealing.  I would have rated the movie higher if it had invested more time building Smiths character and showing his quest for survival day in and day out.  Instead, it breezed over this aspect leaving holes in the plot...and in the end I was left wanting more.  I have heard that a sequel is in the works and has Will Smith signed on to it; it will supposedly explore what happened leading up to where this movie started.  I look forward to a remake but in the mean time this movie left me pondering what it might be like surviving in a world like the one depicted in I Am Legend.
0765342294|4.0|This is the story of Ender Wiggin, a young child who must go to 'battle school' to become the comander of Earth's starship fleet and fight the alien 'Buggers.'<br /><br />Overall well written and entertaining, Ender's Game is a must read for people who enjoy Sci-Fi.... or really anyone for that matter. I think it drags a tiny bit in the middle but the end makes up for it.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie, although it is rather sad. It's a reminder that history not remembered could very well be repeated.  Received quickly.
0446581348|1.0|I really didn't think this book was very good for the average consumer. I also have [[ASIN:1592331823 Makeup Makeovers: Expert Secrets for Stunning Transformations]] by Robert Jones and I learned exponentially more from it.<br /><br />One of my biggest problems was the 1/3 of the book that was geared entirely to makeup artists. I could really care less how to put makeup on a movie star.<br /><br />All in all I wish I had my 20 bucks back because after reading it cover to cover (I may have skimmed a bit during that last 1/3) I don't imagine that I'll ever feel the need to open it again. There are much better books on makeup out there.
B001LF4IA6|1.0|This sophomore album of Bruce Springsteen's lacks what his previous albums under the alias John Cougar Mellencamp had. Where are the Pink Houses? What about Jack and Diane?<br /><br />Born in the U.S.A. is pure bilge coming from a native Canadian who's claim to fame is a song about being born somewhere he wasn't.<br />Musically, the album soars on the songs such as Good Eye and What Love Can Do, on which Mr \\"Springsteen's\\" piano skills are showcased. Other than these breif bright spots the rest of the album lacks creativity. This release is all about America from a Canadian. \\"Springsteen\\" continues to align himself with the religious right and takes any opportunity he can to exploit the victims of 9/11. I'm still waiting for his \\"Oh Canada!\\" release.<br />Better luck next time, Bruce!
B0017ANAZO|1.0|I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the original 1930s version of this movie so when I found out that there would be a modernized version, I was very excited to see it.<br /><br />In case you haven't seen the original, it's about a woman who's living the fabulous life but finds out her \\"loving\\" husband is cheating on her with a perfume girl at \\"Blacks.\\"  Her friends find out about it before she does (from a mancurist of all people) and they debate whether or not to tell her.  Mary (the one with the no-good, frog-faced, rougish, rat fink dog of a husband) finds out herself from the same mancurist and her Mom's advices her on what to do.  Mom suggests that she does nothing b/c if the husband really loved the girl, Mary would have felt it long ago and if she gets her friends involved then she'll just have another thing that she'll have to deal with.<br /><br />Mary finally confronts the other woman (Crystal) that's creeping around with her husband in a dressing room.  After Crystal obviously has no remorse about what she's doing, Mary confronts Steven (the rat) and says she wants a divorce.<br /><br />She gets the divorce in Reno but realizes too late that neither of them really want the divorce.  Steven feels that it is his duty to marry Crystal to protect what was left of her reputation.  (Yeah, I know, but men were a bit more chivalrous back then, which is pretty cool b/c nowadays some men leave ya with nothing more than a a kick in the teeth).<br /><br />Over a year passes and Mary still loves Steven and by now Steven can't stand Crystal.  Mary finds out that Crystal is cheating on Steven and devises a way to expose Crystal and get Steven back.  She does, the end.<br /><br />Fast forward to 2008 and what happens?!  A total disappointment!!  Okay, that wasn't completely accurate.  On its own I give it 1 1/4 out of 5 stars b/c the movie provide a few chuckles but as a modern day adaptation 1 1/2 and that's only because they did stay true to the plot for the most part.  I also give it props b/c it dealt with issues that women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.  Good show for that.  But, even though it kept your attention (for me, it was mostly out of pure curiosity), it wasn't the laugh fest that I thought it would be.  Also, they wrote out my favorite character (Miriam Aarons) so it was all over for me.  And, while the concept of no men in the cast added to the quirkiness of the original, it just didn't seem realistic for today.women face today like the influence of the media on women's body images.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|On the surface - how is it possible for a successful, married playwright to fall in love with a widow with four little boys?  But this film shows one of the most tender love stories one can possibly imagine.<br /><br />We have all grew up hearing the story about Peter Pan.  There were numerous movies made about the story too.  But how this story came to happen and who inspired it is the true root of this film.<br /><br />Johnny Depp gives beautiful performance about the young playwright trying to find his own voice.  Stifled in unsuccessful marriage and bound by strict social conventions of the time, he and a young widow along with her four little boys form an alliance that is impossible to break.  This is a tender story about many forms of love: love for a soulmate and a muse, love of innocence lost in four little boys whose parents die all too soon, love of theatre and storytelling that creates a new kind of reality that is beautiful and generously offered to anyone willing to accept it.  This movie is a classic.
B000FS9MV0|5.0|I have always enjoyed seeing Renee Olstead on TV (Still Standing) and movies (13 Going on 30) --- but her voice when she sings is just amazing.  This is the second CD that I have of hers - her voice was extremely mature on the previous CD but now it is even more so. She has such maturity of voice and the feeling that comes through is tremendous.... I would recommend her recordings to everyone.  You just have to forget the fact that she is so young and just enjoy her talent!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|\\"Let the right ONE in\\" is poetry on celluloid, it is one of those rare gems that comes along only once in a while.  I am not a big fan of vampire literature, but this story is so beautiful and the film is so well done that it will hunt you for a long time.   It will hunt you, I might add only if you are open to non-conformist, exceptional and personal cinema.   It was a small US release in 2008, and not surprisingly it was overlooked by the Oscars Group.   Is it a horror film? It could be. A love story? Definitely. Thriller? Not really.  It is a film full of surprises, enigma and metaphors.   Especially, I love the brilliant music by Johan Söderqvis and the two fine young actors playing Eli and Oscar.   The cat scene? Just have a great time watching it.  The end scene? Always remember, what goes around comes around, but most importantly, as much as possible, or whenever possible: let the right ONE into your life.  Simply brilliant filmmaking.
0385339682|2.0|Juror is written in the familiar Grisham style--lots of local color and engaging characters. But here's my beef: every once in a while, like a faulty rendition on a piano, Grisham hits some false notes that leap off the page and jar the reader's brain. These are occasioned by his ignorance of people, geography or whatnot. And you wonder what happened.  Where's his research?  Where's his editor? Some examples: A character named Piston cleans offices in the downtown area. Grisham writes that no one knows where Piston lives. You can be damn sure in a small town almost everyone knows where everyone else lives!  Small error? Sure, but careless. Grisham describes a river as running straight as though a cut channel. Geologists, cartographers, and other people familiar with landforms know rivers never take a perfectly straight course; they meander. He describes a dinner cooked by Miss Callie as featuring lamb stew. I challenge anyone to find lamb meat outside of the larger cities in the South during that period. In those days most fresh meat was local or within no more that 200 miles. There were no sheep ranches south of the Mason-Dixon. Even today most southerners do not eat lamb. We know nothing about the hero's love life outside of a couple of one night hook-ups. Are we to believe he lived in a small town without a love life?  Or if he had girlfriends over, he wasn't the subject of gossip? Come on!  Has Grisham got a tin ear?  There are merits to the book, but, for me, they do not outweigh a series of false notes.

B001FBSMF8|4.0|Chris Cornell's third CD is produced by Timbaland and it is what one would expect, for the most part: Swathed in synth strings, clipped dance beats, haunting choirs, and every other little trick pulled from Timbaland's box. The stunning cover art should be warning enough, Cornell in mid air, about to smash down on his guitar, alluding to the large absence of guitars maybe? Expect absolutely no screaming guitar solos.<br /><br />The opening quartet of songs are R&B/Dance numbers which wouldn't sound out of place on Timberlake's or Timbaland's albums, and which I guess are geared at the clubs. \\"Part of me\\" even finds Cornell singing \\"That b*tch aint a part of me\\". Of the four, this, and \\"Time\\" are standouts. Timbaland's strong influence is also heard on songs like superb guitar-drenched \\"Never far away\\" which reminds one of \\"What goes around\\" or \\"Cry me a river\\" by Timberlake. \\"Scream\\" sounds like OneRepublic's \\"Apologise\\", while the nice Rock ballad \\"Long gone\\" reminds one a wee bit of \\"My love\\" by Timberlake.<br /><br />While there isn't anything musically revolutionary, there are some very good songs. The buzzing \\"Ground zero\\" which was inspired by 9/11, the sitar-laced \\"Take me alive\\" with a driving riff, the upbeat clubby \\"Enemy\\", the catchy \\"Other side of town\\" with insistent beats and \\"O o o o\\" refrain, \\"Climbing up the walls\\" (No, not the Radiohead classic, but a real charmer) and closing cut the energetic \\"Watch out\\".<br /><br />Each song segues seamlessly into the next, with the coda of each introducing the next song (except for closing cut \\"Watch out\\" which ends with the sound of a tape winding down). This draws one into experiencing the CD as a whole. I must point out that this was also partly used on Timberlake's \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" CD, creating \\"suites\\" of songs. Hidden at the end of the CD is a stripped Blues-y ballad \\"Two drink minimum\\", co-penned with John Mayer. Clocking in at just under 3 minutes, we get to hear the raw passion of his excellent gritty/nasal/snarling vocals, much like \\"Getaway car\\" or his amazing re-working of \\"Billie Jean\\". Dominated by guitar and harmonica, it is free of Timbaland's synths and effects and I'm sure most fans will like this one song. It would fit perfectly on \\"Euphoria morning\\", Cornell's solo debut.<br /><br />One has to leave all expectations of Cornell's various alumni; Soundgarden, Audioslave, even his solo recordings behind to enjoy this. So, is this Timbaland's best production ever like he's been boasting? No way, Timberlake's afore mentioned CD or Brandy's \\"Afrodisiac\\" are better, but still, this is an interesting musical journey for Cornell, better than his last patchy effort \\"Carry on\\". Can't wait to read other reviews as I'm sure this will sharply divide fans.als, much like \\"Getaway car\\" or his amazing re-working of \\"Billie Jean\\".

So, is this Timbaland's best production ever like he's been boasting? No way, Timberlake's afore mentioned CD or Brandy's \\"Afrodisiac\\" are better, but still, this is an interesting musical journey for Cornell, better than his last patchy effort \\"Carry on\\". Can't wait to read other reviews as I'm sure this will sharply divide fans.
B000002G87|5.0|On vinyl, four sides of some of the best rock ever released.  Whether working solo, working with Cream, or working as \\"Derek and the Dominos,\\" Eric Clapton lives solely to play rock songs like a bluesman--or to play blues songs like a rocker.  Either way, these fourteen songs are the best work Clapton ever did, celebrating the common themes that draw us siren-like to all forms of popular music, be it rock or blues or even rap.  The sentiments have been around for as long as humankind has been around--my heart's broken, she left me for another guy, why does love got to be so sad, etc.--but the vitality in these pieces makes them seem new.  They connect as well as they would have in the Twenties, and they'll connect just as well in the 2020s or the 2120s.  The musicianship is unparalleled, the emotion almost astoundingly sincere--when, in their knockout cover of Hendrix's \\"Little Wing,\\" Clapton shouts \\"Right on,\\" he does it not as a rock showman, not even as a darn good rock showman, but as a human being painfully in love with his craft.  These are love songs, alright.  Love songs for the art of rock.
B001UOVP1S|2.0|Different /=/ better.    If this is genuinely Chris Cornell trying to branch out and dabble in other genres of music, then Timbaland seems a peculiar choice of collaborator.  The guy's an \\"expert\\" (if one can call it that) at churning out pop electronica and one of the top producers in the biz in terms of name recognition and earnings power.    Perhaps CC could have considered straying a little less far from his roots for his first evolutionary jump.  However, even assuming his sole purpose of branching out was to test the cheezy pop waters, it's still unclear why he'd pick one of the biggest names versus finding a skilled up-and-comer who would better match the sound to his vocal talents.    Smells like another bogus marketing stunt a la \\"Jay-Z collaborated with Radiohead\\": designed to get confused 20 somethings to believe that this new form of music too rock-infused to be danceable and too poppy to have staying power is THE GREATEST TWIST ON MUSIC since the blues.    Frustrating.
B001TOD92C|5.0|The hype surrounding Mickey Rourke's career comeback took on a life of its own as `The Wrestler' opened to astounding reviews and the awards season swooped in to reward Rourke for finally making it back to the big screen.  This is both a blessing and a malediction.  `The Wrestler' is probably too small a movie to ever get the recognition it deserves without a backstory like Rourke's, yet that backstory is not the primary reason to embrace this film.  `The Wrestler' is so much more than just a vehicle to prove that Rourke still has the chops to hang with the big dogs.  Sadly, because all the focus went to Rourke the film failed to garner the attention it should have.  Every review raved the man in the leotard instead of the dynamic character study unfolding before their eyes.<br /><br />So, with that said; I'm going to review the movie.<br /><br />You ever hear the saying `less is more'?  I'm sure you have.  It's a very common phrase used to express the need to subtlety.  There is such a thing as too much, so sometimes it is best just to let the story remain simple, that way the director and all others involved can develop that one simple story to perfection.  Such is the case with `The Wrestler'.<br /><br />Here we are told the story of Randy `The Ram' Robinson.  He's a middle-aged, battle scarred wrestler who is way past his prime and desperately trying to adjust to life outside the ring.  When his world is shaken to the core by a physical ailment he is left trying to regain his stride.  Stripped of his entire purpose for existence he is thrown into the world of mere mortals, left to pick up the pieces of his pride as he struggles to be normal.  This means forming a relationship with a local stripper, attempting to reconnect with the daughter he abandoned and even trying to find work that will not just pay the bills but fill a void that has left him rather empty.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a film about a man struggling to live.<br /><br />What is brilliantly captured here is the fact that this world of make believe is the only world that makes any sense to Randy.  As fake and controlled and faux as his ventures in the ring may be (although, it is made brutally obvious that these men do literally destroy themselves for our amusement) it is the only part of his life that is real to him.  Everything else, all the normal human interaction, is a struggle for him.  His attraction to Cassidy (the stripper) is an indication of this as well, since she too is simply playing a part.  They are similar in that their profession defines them and their personal lives are almost a job to them; something far removed from who they really are.<br /><br />The beauty of not bombarding this film with so many subplots and twists is that Aronofsky was able to say so much about humanity.<br /><br />Okay, so now I'll talk about the acting.<br /><br />Before I get to Rourke I want to talk about Marisa Tomei.  Tomei delivers what may be the greatest supporting female performance of the decade here.  What she does here, the emotional connection (and emotional resistance), is perfection.  The scene where she sits in Randy's truck and he's trying desperately to connect to her and you can hear the resistance, the wall she puts up, in her voice; I mean she is stunningly on point.  All her displays of affection have this veneer of surrealism that captures the nature of her profession brilliantly.  Evan Rachel Wood also has a few very effective scenes, although I found her quieter scenes (that whole \\"You're my little girl\\" scene in particular) to be the most moving.<br /><br />And then there is Rourke.  I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said, but know this, his portrayal of Randy plays out so much like a self portrait that his performance feels truly organic.  This is not acting.  I think that is the biggest compliment I can give Rourke and probably the biggest compliment you can give any actor.  He transcends the performance and simply embodies the man.  Next to Rourke, it is director Aronofsky that delivers the final touches that make this `simple' story ultimately so profound.  The brutal close ups, the untouched rawness of the individuals inside and out; the broken bones and bloodied bodies.  This movie is all about honesty, and it shines through on every frame.<br /><br />So, `The Wrestler' deserves to be considered as more than just `the Mickey Rourke show'.  `The Wrestler' deserves to be considered one of the best films of the year, period.  Its brutal honesty is as devastating as it is life affirming; and the final frame (that fade to black to be exact) is the perfect note to end on; bringing the films very personal message to fruition.vers the final touches that make this `simple' story ultimately so profound.

0307269752|5.0|Agatha Christie books were my favorite reads when I was a kid/teenager so much so that I purchased her entire collection and have since reread the books multiple times. When I read the blurb for \\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\" at my local Barnes and Noble, I couldn't resist picking it up. I am glad I did - after I long time I read a book cover to cover in one sitting (and at some 450 odd pages, its not very short). Once you start off though, I am sure you will find it hard to put it down as I did. Steig Larsson (I was sad to see he won't be delighting us with his pensmanship for years to come though) develops each and every character as well as location in his book. I could almost visualize the scenes and the characters as I read his debut work (to me that is the sign of a good book).<br />The central mystery of the novel is a cold case (almost thirty years old) - the mysterious disappearance of a teenaged Harriet Vanger, a scion of the Swedish Vanger conglomerate (albeit orphaned) from an island with no way in or out. Her uncle, who was very close to her, never abandons his search for her and finally close to his deathbed, he hires an investigative journalist, Henrik Blomkvist to put the issue to rest. There are several side plots that are cleverly woven into the fabric of the central mystery such as the exploitation of \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" by patriarchs of Swedish society, Blomkvist's vendetta against Wennerstrom (a rich but corrupt Swedish business icon) etc that will keep you glued for hours at end.<br />Larsson does a great job portraying the Swedish countryside where the central mystery is set. You can't help but be reminded of some of the characters on Fargo (the movie) - its almost as if this is a mordern Agatha Christie mystery set in Fargo.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|cant get enough of this album start to finish. they have a distinct unique style to them which is rare these days.<br />its the kind of music that makes you feel something
B0015D3YQI|5.0|Like most Americans familiar with this work, I remember this film from the 80's video release \\"Creepers\\" which while sporting intense and great coverart to help attract rentals, is completely subpar in comparison to this uncut, highly original nightmare! The video and audio have received a much needed remaster and the film feels crisp and new, while retaining all the mysticism Argento intended. I feel it is unnessecary to explain this movie's plot, except to say, if you saw Creepers whether you liked it or not, you NEED to see the original! There are many subplots in this movie, all of which pan out in some way or another. Maybe not to the dynamic degree wanted by some viewers, but adequate enough to fulfill the normal viewer.<br />The performances are fantastic, the music is great (typical Argento) though musically at times it tends to move in a weird direction, (see: motorhead, iron maiden). The extras have been lovingly researched and offer some rare gems, including an old mid-80s Argento interview on American TV, as well as the pointlessly convoluded videos for both of the film's main songs. All in all the film is a ten, the extras are a ten, I cant find any fault in this.
1892005034|4.0|I enjoyed many parts of the book, especially the common theme of becoming much more intentional in how you communicate your needs to others.  I did find that some of the practices suggested by Rosenberg may not always be practical with the population of people in my practice as well as for my own personal style of practice.  It is, however, definitely worth reading.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|If you expect reviews of Soundgarden or Audioslave songs, you wont find it in this album. It sounds like pop music, electronic drums, synthetized guitars. Old fans probably wont like. Well, I dont like Scream.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|I am a huge Soundgarden/AudioSlave/Cornell fan, but this is one time I just cannot accept this as anything close to good.  First off, the engineering is terrible.  I guess you could say it is \\"quirky\\" and off beat\\", but I am very disappointed.  I certainly have nothing against collaboration, but Timbaland?  Come on.  Take it from Raising Sand, produced by T-Bone Burnett, that is how you produce a collaboration.  Chemistry is where it's at and there is not much to speak of on Screm.  Sorry Chris.
B0014BDP88|3.0|This is not the 111 minute cut as advertised, this is the conventional cut, better off buying the region 1 version.
B0002858YS|2.0|Some people may disagree with me completely, but The Killers are really just glam rockers without a brain.<br /><br />Actually, I shouldn't say that. They are very good at sounding cool. All the singles on this album sound very cool, with techno beeps, vamping guitars and loud drums.<br /><br />Aside from that, Brandon Flowers' lyrics are really just the typical angst lyrics gathered from the Gen X bands of the 90s. Songs such as \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" involve the main singer killing his ex-girlfriend. I was not impressed by the lyrics, \\"There ain't no motive for this crime/Jenny was a friend of mine/So come on.\\"<br /><br />Flowers continues his streak of angst with songs such as \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" where he's upset that he acted like \\"Mr. Brightside\\" while his girlfriend was having sex with someone else. Other songs, such as \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" are sadly self-explanatory, while \\"Somebody Told Me\\" just confused me with lyrics about a boyfriend who looks like a girlfriend that Flowers had in February of last year.<br /><br />And then there are the terrible songs about Flowers' blatant love for indie rock, where he literally sings \\"Betcha your bottom dollar on me/It's indie rock and roll for me.\\" Other songs, such as \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" features some outdated slow, slow Depeche Mode electronic sounds, while Flowers sings \\"In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world/Cause Andy, you're a star.\\"<br /><br />As much as I wish that they had sung something much more substantial, it was incredibly popular in 2004, when it first hit the airwaves. So if anyone likes the band, they can just ignore what I wrote in this review. But if anyone wants to stay away from popular monotony, then they can just steer away from this album at all costs. Please.
B001G0MFOM|2.0|I am still digesting the finale, which I watched two days ago with a big group of friends and many other people around the world.  I think I heard screams of unfulfillment across the land when the credits started rolling after its \\"Soprano's like\\" ending.  All I can ask is...why?  Why would they end it like that?  Not only do I think they should have told us who killed Jenny, but dang it, I wanted to see Jenny confronted about many things she had done up to that point.  She had this crusade about \\"everybody needs to be truthful\\", therefore ruining their lives... but it came crashing down with Shane finding the letter and movie reels.  ugh.  I am just very ticked off and therefore cannot give a decent rating to this SHORT as it was final season.  Very disappointing.<br />Since that night, I've been all over the internet in search of who killed jenny.  Showtime is currently showing \\"Interrogation Tapes\\" that supposedly give more insight to the killing.  Through imdb.com and E! Online, I've learned that Alice has a spin off called The Farm, where it says she gets convicted of Jenny's murder and sent off to prison.  E! mentioned rumor of a movie to finish things off.  Now this is all fine and dandy, but just boils me more that I want to know NOW... and the show, being the first of its kind...just should have been a better show in its final season.
B001DJLCRC|3.0|I was really impressed with everything about this show. However, there is way too much dramatic tension for my taste, and I don't consider myself a drama lightweight. After watching the second and third episode yesterday, I couldn't sleep last night. I kept getting woken up by flash-backs.    This definitely needs an R rating! I sure wouldn't want kids seeing this.

1577314808|5.0|I have read hundreds of different books on spiritual teachings and I must say that there is no other author I have read who seems to pinpoint the human condition as well as Eckhart Tolle. One can teach positive thinking and the \\"Law of Attraction\\" to help create a more peaceful and joyful experience, but those only address the symptoms of a miserable life, not the cause. Tolle has truly pinpointed the essence of human struggle...and it is with ourselves. Our mind-identified self protrayed as the ego keeps us on a constant struggle for temporal satisfaction...an endless roller coaster of emotions which never provide the true peace that we all desire.   The idea that we are all looking to become something in the future, or that we identify with a victim we may have become in the past rings loud and clear with me and many of my friends and relatives. The past and future don't even exist and NOW is all there is or ever will be.   I can't even begin to describe the mind shift this has made in my life and how it helped me to find peace.   I think everyone needs to open their mind to the ideas in this book.

B001UOVP1S|1.0|WOW. I was willing to look past the other reviews and give it a go, but ... now I feel like I need to go wash out my ears. I love Chris Cornell, I really do. But this is ... well, it's ... Disco Chris Cornell. Poppy-synthy-beat Chris Cornell. Ride the Stairmaster to it Chris Cornell. Was it released too soon? Was it supposed to be an April 1 release? \\"Hah ha, fooled ya, now here's the real one...\\" If only. I'm so sorry, Chris, dearest, but I just don't belong here in your Boogie Wonderland. When you land back on Planet Rock, though, call me. I'll be ready.
B000001FC0|5.0|This is the album that, to me, complete makes Tears for Fears the memorable band that they are. This was my first ever cassette that i owned, and of course I have since gotten this on CD. I would listen to this on my \\"boombox\\" with the automatic tape flip, and let it loop endlessly, and i never got tired of this album. To this day, if i listen to this, i cannot help but sing along with every word, and jam out to the great songs that are on this album. This is a must have for anyone that listens to 80's Pop Rock, and a must own for anyone that has ever even kind-of liked tears for Fears. This album will change your veiw on the band forever. Great guitar licks, catchy melodies, and hook after hook throughtout the entire disc. Get this album and you will not regret it.
B0017R5UAA|2.0|Not a particularly good CD.  A few songs are good but mostly wimpy vocals put me to sleep.
B00005JL78|5.0|This is an excellent movie. From the cinamatic tinting, to the action sequences, to an excellent exicution of the story-line. Every actor was well cast in their roles, and there are zero changes that I would have made. The future also seemed beleivable and real, and not too Fake, Plastic, and Stereo-typical. The movie even sucks you in and makes you forget that it is over 2 hours long. I honestly beleive that having had Speilberg working on this movie is what made it a cinematic enjoyment, as well as having Tom Cruise in a role that he could really sink his new teeth into. This is by far the best in the series of films to date, and I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!
B000002JAX|5.0|Dreamland by Madeleine Peyroux showcases her talents beautifully. Madeleine has a gift that enables to sing just about anything she wants to and make it sound like a symphony. Predictably, Madeleine performs quite well on this album; and that's grand. Yes, there are some similarities between Madeleine and the great Billie Holiday; fortunately for us both ladies chose to share their talents with us. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is very nicely done as well. There's plenty to like here!<br /><br />\\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" shines like silver and gold when Madeleine sings it; and that musical arrangement is terrific without ever stealing the show away from Madeleine. \\"Walkin' After Midnight\\" is a strong first number and it makes you want more right away. Madeleine sounds just perfect. She's right in her natural element; and that music is lovely. Madeleine makes a few quick tempo changes that impress me quite a bit and she never sings a superfluous note! \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\" by Fred Ahlert and Joe Young was always one of my very favorite classic pop vocal tunes. \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\" features Madeleine putting her own stamp on this ballad and she sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. In addition, that musical arrangement for \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Write Myself A Letter\\" is very interesting--it may startle you a bit at first because it's different from what people are used to hearing for this song; but after a couple of listens it quickly grew on me and now I rather like the music that goes with Madeleine's vocals.<br /><br />\\"La Vie En Rose\\" gets a fine treatment that would make Edith Piaf proud; \\"La Vie En Rose\\" stuns me with its beauty and it certainly is a major highlight of this album. \\"La Vie En Rose\\" is truly a timeless ballad. Great! \\"A Prayer\\" again has Madeleine performing at her very best; and that percussion enhances the music quite a bit. \\"A Prayer\\" is quite a number and I think it too is a highlight of this album.<br /><br />\\"Muddy Water\\" puts Madeleine Peyroux squarely front and center--and I certainly have no complaints about that! \\"Muddy Water\\" gets the royal treatment from both Madeleine and the musicians and I really like this song. \\"Dreamland,\\" the title track for this album, gets another fine arrangement and Madeleine performs this faultlessly. I like those key modulations, too! Madeleine's \\"Dreamland\\" comes from a lot of hard work.<br /><br />\\"Reckless Blues\\" by Bessie Smith has a great piano arrangement; and Madeleine Peyroux ends the CD performing \\"Lovesick Blues.\\"<br /><br />Dreamland by Madeleine Peyroux really scores a big goal in my book! I'm extremely impressed and I highly recommend this album for Madeleine's fans as well as fans of jazzy, bluesy types of music.

B001QWEE4E|5.0|As the first reviewer of this product simply decided to spread hate speech rather than review the film itself perhaps someone should. The film is brilliant.  The cinematography is breathtaking, and the acting couldn't have been better if it were a documentary.     As for the first \\"reviewer\\"  the film is about unrequited love, not something as simple as \\"gay cowboys\\"  Something which by the way is entirely plausible.  Are you aware that eight percent of all sheep are gay? How about the fact that penguins will mate with members of the same sex? Just because gay people can not procreate does not mean it is not natural.  Maybe you should go read a book written by a scientist rather than a barely literate hate monger.
B001KP2Y3K|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux's brand new CD entitled \\"Bare Bones\\" displays her evolution as an artist. For the first time Madeleine doesn't just sing on an album; she also wrote a lot of the material for this CD. Some will say that a singer who wants to write their own songs takes a mighty big risk, but actually Madeleine succeeds rather well at both singing and songwriting. Sure, Madeleine could have pushed the boundaries a bit more; but she is becoming an even better artist who can now write their own songs. Although Madeleine got help writing these songs from people including Walter Becker and Joe Henry, she did write \\"I Must Be Saved\\" independently. She even plays the acoustic guitar on this album! I'm impressed; Madeleine can do just about anything she wants to do. She completely throws herself into each ballad on this album; and you can tell it's true with just one listen. The quality of the sound is excellent and that artwork is very nicely done.<br /><br />The album starts with Madeleine singing \\"Instead;\\" she delivers this with panache and she never sounded better! \\"Instead\\" is not just a strong start for the album; it's a highlight of the album as well. That music fits in perfectly with Madeleine's vocals and it never steals the show away from her--great! \\"Instead\\" just couldn't have been written any better. \\"Bare Bones,\\" the title track for this album, has a fantastic musical arrangement; and Madeleine sings this faultlessly. I really like \\"Bare Bones;\\" and listen also for \\"River of Tears.\\" \\"River of Tears\\" has a laid-back flavor to it even though those lyrics are not exactly the happiest, to be sure. Madeleine wears her heart on her sleeve when she sings \\"River of Tears\\" and it all holds its own very well.<br /><br />\\"You Can't Do Me\\" has some very interesting key modulations and Madeleine performs this without a superfluous note. \\"You Can't Do Me\\" features Madeleine squarely in the spotlight and that's definitely all right by me! Madeleine sings of a woman who won't be hurt by the same man twice. \\"Love And Treachery\\" sports a very pretty melody matched up with some set of lyrics; and \\"Our Lady Of Pigalle\\" is about a woman of the night working in the Pigalle section of Paris. The guitar work in \\"Our Lady Of Pigalle\\" enhances the natural beauty of this ballad and I could never tire of hearing Madeleine Peyroux sing \\"Our Lady Of Pigalle.\\" What an awesome singer Madeleine truly is!<br /><br />\\"To Love You All Over Again\\" has an incredible laid-back melody that charms me with its beauty; and Madeleine's ability to deliver this so well makes this yet another major highlight of this CD.

B001UOVP1S|2.0|Based solely on the 30 second samples in their entirety (so about 7.5 minutes of music), this album sounds so unoriginal and \\"pop\\" laden, that I wouldn't even spend the seemingly bargain price of $2.99 for the MP3 album. However, if you want something that harkens back to early 80's pop-rock (complete with sequencers), then go for it. It sounds exactly like what Robert Palmer and Phil Collins already did 25 years ago, only not as good.
B000EHSVQE|4.0|If someone had told me an independent film about a geeky nerd--a film sporting a cast of characters who sit around with the most vacuous, blank expressions imaginable, and whose dialogue consists primarily of monosyllabic words--would become a cultural phenomenon. . .I would be asking that person if I could have what he or she is drinking.  Yet such is indeed the case with the extremely strange NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, a movie so. . .different. . .it's still creating a buzz, as evidenced by the 1400 reviews here (and counting).<br /><br />Napolean (Jon Heder).  Pedro (Efren Ramirez).  Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Uncle Rico (Jon Gries).  Gentlemen, I salute you.  You have taken your respective characters to the realm of bizzarro (and beyond).  And after my initial shock, after several subsequent viewings, I have thoroughly enjoyed your performances:  Kip's unique method of locomotion; Uncle Rico's love of steak and of videotaping his throwing motion; Pedro's blank gaping; Napolean's ultimate dancing performance.  All of the above now ensconced in film legend; all of the above just plain darn fun to watch.<br /><br />It's often lame and ridiculous, and sometimes Heder's nerdiness becomes so irritating it's tempting to send the remote through the flat screen, but director Jared Hess knew what he was doing when he crafted this supremely unique film.  NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE, kind of like a mosquito bite, just grows on you, and is more fun to watch as you scratch.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]

But since, the rating starts from 1 to 5, I'll settle for 5. This is a movie to own and watch. And finally, I am not going to sit here to tell you not to watch this movie. Please go ahead and buy and watch it. You will not be dissappointed.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|Not quite a classic, this film about good and evil, the Devil on earth and redemption is fun to watch.  Nicholas Cage does a good job in this film that mixes some horror with humor.  Eva Mendes really can't act, but is in the film to provide some T & A.    While not quite a cult classic, based on the Marvel comics works, it will entertain a viewer with some rude scenes and typical bad guys from the underworld getting their just desserts.  Fun to watch, especially to see Nicholas Cage as the Ghost Rider.
B001ILFUDC|4.0|Walt Disney Studio's \\"Platinum Editions\\" of their most beloved films - classic and contemporary - have been a must - have for me. I am now reviewing the lastest title to get this status - the 70th Anniversary edition of Walt Disney's Pinocchio.    For a feature almost seventy, the film is presented beautifully. While another reviewer felt the film was digitally altered, I got the opposite feeling. Based on the layouts and backgrounds presented in the bonus features, I got the feeling the previous versions altered the color scheme.    For Audio options - Disney allows the viewer to choose between the Disney Enhanced Theater Mix - all 5.1 surround - English, French, or Spanish. Disney also provides the original Mono soundtrack used when the film opened in 1940. Disney restored the soundtrack well - except somebody forgot a bit of Jiminy's voiceover during \\"Give a Little Whistle\\". Pinocchio sounds okay with a home theater system. The music and voices are easy to hear. The majority of the film is spread over the three main speakers - and not the surround, from my observation.   This edition of \\"Pinocchio\\" is a definite upgrade over the 2002 \\"Limited Edition\\" Disc. Bonus features, and a beautiful transfer rule out the washed out, grainy picture of the other.

1423113497|5.0|I used the first book for a reading group in my fourth grade class and they all loved it.  Boys and girls alike liked the action and the humor involved. All of them went on to read the rest of the series on their own.  They all are asking when the next one will come out.  Very highly recommended!
0385340990|5.0|If you are not sure how this book got it's unusual name that is only one of the fascinating things you will learn as you read this book of letters.<br /><br />The book is made up of correspondence between a woman from London and the lovely people of the island of Guernsey. Not only will you find yourself caring for all of these people but they will seem so real to you that you wish you could visit!<br /><br />And, you will certainly wish you could have been a member of their<br />Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society....though after the Occupation.<br /><br />There is a deep message about what life was like in Europe during the war, something many have addressed but never quite this way. You will hear about the good, the bad and the ugly and how people with great courage and strength find a way to overcome even the most difficult circumstances.<br /><br />While the subject matter could be dark and depressing, Shaffer and Barrows have brilliantly found a way to lighten the subject without dismissing or degrading it one bit.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book club read, or, on your own in a big comfy chair!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

Useless, an abandoned neuron will die.\\"<br /><br />In STILL ALICE, we meet Dr. Alice Howland at the height of her prestigious career as an esteemed professor of  cognitive psychology at Harvard University in Boston. Dr. Howland is successful, not only in the classroom, but in all areas of her flourishing life.<br /><br />This idyllic landscape is soon fractured by tiny cracks in the finely tuned fabric of her daily routine.<br /><br />Lisa Genova writes from the heart with a prodigious talent for guiding the reader into the very poignant and discordant realities of early on-set Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />With powerful insight and the latest medical information, the reader journeys with Alice through attentive narrative. Through Alice's eyes, the reader experiences the jarring sense of  losing bits of cognitive awareness in real time and with stirring consequences.<br /><br />But as Alice slips further away cognitively...she seems more in tune with her instincts and her emotional awareness appears to heighten. As words escape her, new paths of understanding and coping emerge.<br />Lisa Genova presents an emotionally moving and vivid picture of Alzheimer's from the victim's point of view.<br /><br />The brushstrokes on this canvas are candidly honest while moving through stages of denial, fear, anger, loss and finally....acceptance.<br /><br />We are left to ponder our identity and relationships, question what ultimately defines us, and most importantly, understand that neurons are just a fraction of the whole.
B000VWE5OY|1.0|Awful, don't waste your time, the story doesn't make sense, the writers should find another job. This so called team \\"Torchwood\\", is so secret everybody knows them, they answer to no authority yet the Police (pictured as a bunch of puppets) drop to their knees for them. The lead actor John Barrowman is so bad he doesn't even qualify as an actor, he is not a bit convincing as a group leader of any kind. Now if you are into gay sex you might find it somewhat appealing as 4 out of 5 lead characters have some sort of homosexual AND heterosexual relationship during the show, as stated before by other reviewer this does not corresponds to reality. I thought I was buying a sci-fi show not a mediocre gay propaganda show.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I have a better-than-average system, so maybe many people won't care about this, but I've got to say that this album and Magic have some terrible recording quality.  I can't turn them up!  They're just too harsh!  I've read in some of the posts that many are attributing the sound quality to the recent \\"wall of sound\\" preference of recording engineers.  I'm not sure, but think that Brendan O'Brien is utilizing the digital compression techniques that bands like Metallica and Oasis have used to make their recordings sound \\"louder\\" when played back on your average car audio system.  Gawd - I have to turn this thing DOWN to decipher the music underneath!  Please Bruce - stop the madness!    On the other side - unlike many others, I think WOAD and Magic are some of the best songs that Bruce has come up with in a long time.  The melodies he is coming up with these past few years are OUTSTANDING, especially compared to the POP drivel that's going over the airwaves today.  If you're a Bruce fan, don't let the low-grade recording quality of this, or Magic, hinder you from purchasing.  You'll be missing some tremendous music by a rock legend.  Buy it for the songs!
B00006ADD5|4.0|Between the direction of David Lean and the photography of Freddie Young, this is a fabulous visual treat, one to be treasured.  I'll certainly be interested to see what this looks like when someone makes a Blu-Ray version of this film.    Unfortunately, the story as well as the great visuals, seem to dissipate in the last hour-plus of the movie. It just kind of peters out, like Lawrence's desert campaign.    The acting, led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, is superb with the possible exception of Anthony Quinn, who overacts. Two of the all-time greats - Alec Guiness and Omar Sharif - also added life to this monumental epic story. This was O'Toole's first role, too, and probably his most famous and some think his best.as the premier actor in the business.    For a film this long and with such little action, it's amazing it entertains as well as it does. For those who need some pretty women to aid in the story, forget it: in fact, there are NO women that I can remember. It gets by with the cinematography, O'Toole intense acting portraying a real-life vain, courageous, stubborn and obsessed Englishman trying to unite the Arabs to fight the Turks.    Another very memorable and impressive aspect of this movie was the soundtrack. Is it my imagination or were soundtracks (like this one) more important and remembered better than movies in the last quarter of a decade? The main theme song is played throughout the film and I still remember it 47 years later.
B001UOVP1S|2.0|i didn't want to give it 1 star cause i didn't hate i just disliked it very much i guess cause i'm an AUDIOSLAVE fan and even though i listen to all music like zero 7 to jill scott to cream this album (not just because it's not the chris cornell i'm not used to) just didn't catch me but good sound quality which is important.
B00005O5CM|3.0|A bimbo becoming a top lawyer: that's the premise here and a winsome Reese Witherspoon pulls it off in a charming way, which she would have to do to make this ludicrous story watchable.     It's a bit on the feminist side with most men pictured as shallow but there are women pictured the same, too. In an era PC baloney, at least this film pokes fun at everyone, not just select groups.    Witherspoon and Luke Wilson both play good, nice people and it's nice to see a Wilson brother NOT playing someone stupid. There are stupid parts in here, but you get that in any comedy. There are also some very clever lines in there, too, but overall it's pretty low-brained material.....just played for fun. It would have been more innocent without a needless off-key or profane remark here and there.
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|Dogs are crowd pleasers. That's one of the reasons Beverly Hills Chihuahua was a surprise hit at the movies last year. And rather than a lot of head scratching about why other, more \\"lofty\\" films didn't fare as well, perhaps it's because high concept films -- ones that have a premise so simple and fun-sounding that usually the title tells it and the trailer is loaded with signature gags.<br /><br />The good news is that \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is on a par with Disney light comedies of days past, the kind that weren't classics but were as pleasurable as popsicles and left happy childhood memories, though somewhat more elaborate and technically lush.<br /><br />Director Raja Gosnell has no illusions that he's filming Brecht or Proust -- he literally begins his commentary (thanks for having one!) with a self-deprecating anecdote. But what emerges from his detailed explanations of the intricacies of filmmaking with dogs and special effects, as well as the talents involved, are skill, professionalism and enthusiasm.<br /><br />One of the most interesting aspects of the film technique, making the dogs seem to have conversations and interact together, is similar to combining live action and animation. The dogs are usually filmed individually, then composited in the film lab to appear together. In editing, specific poses and movements are pinpointed and then the mouths and brows are animated.<br /><br />Although most dialogue is pre-recorded, the voice actors' improvisations are added and the characters developed. George Lopez's comedy inventiveness was such that Papi's character was expanded from a minor role. In fact, the whole film evolved from a more straightforward, serious story to a comedy (a fact proven by deleted scenes on the DVD).<br /><br />Drew Barrymore, who deserves more recognition for her capabilities as a voice actor, manages to convey sympathy for a fairly whiny little pooch. Her expressive, just-slightly-but-not-too-overwrought vocal range would have made her a fine radio actress in the 1940s.40s.
B0002S947K|4.0|I had heard about Ray Lamontagne from watching American Idol...which I'm sure is a strange place to hear about an indie artist. However, after hearing a few contestants sing Trouble, I wanted to listen to the original version. I was very impressed when I listened to the other songs on this album. The songs are very well-written, and they are so catchy that I find myself singing the lyrics for days. My favorites on this album are Hannah, Jolene, and Trouble. However, all of the songs are solid and the album is very cohesive. I am excited about hearing more of his music!

B001ECE6C6|1.0|Well, I have noticed over the past few years Pat has been essentially rehashing his older material. Nevertheless, this album is nothing but boring; and do we need anymore versions of Pat's music?? and why?? I've been very disappointed lately with Pat's output of material. This one isn't any different. I love the originals and these remakes sound like clannad or enya versions....one word fuzak. If you like smooth jazz recordings you will probably enjoy this; for the rest of us this is not worth the money.

B00005JPY2|5.0|Since its initial printing in 1984, Watchmen has basically been the standard by which all comics to follow would be judged. its top notch story telling, and character developement are fully evident in the theatrical vision of this story.<br /><br />Zach Snyder was the best director Watchmen could've had, his style perfectly fits this gritty, harrowing tale, not to mention the highly stylized action in the vein of 300 with all the bone crunching hits in tact.<br /><br />if you are clueless as to the story, there are plenty of long reviews on here that go over all that, so ill spare the little details. i just want to say, its one of the best comic adaptations ive ever seen, if not THE best. this movie delivers on every front, action, story, visuals, character developement. it was had to beleve they could condense a full years comic run into one movie, but they did it perfectly, i hate to say it, as much as i absolutely love the books little complexities, but the pacing was probably better than the original story, along with the ending.<br /><br />all older/mature fans of masked vigilante films need to see this, and to all fans of the original work - this is a faithful rendition of one of the best stories ever told in comics. it couldnt get any better, unless there is an unrated directors cut upon dvd/blu-ray release.<br /><br />just so everyone knows. the definition of \\"ignorant\\" is lacking knowledge of or uninformed. i figured id explain it seeing some people are so oblivious to their own language.

The examples are fantastic and can be easily related to what one sees in their own life history.<br /><br />What you learn is to look wider at situations.

B001FBSMF8|1.0|Horrible. The one and only word to describe this mess. It sounds like it was written on one of those casio toy keyboards. I have been a Cornell fan(worshipper) since the Louder Than Love days. Bought and own every album, import and unreleased bit of music that he has written since then. I cautiously bought tickets to see Chris live and was given a free download of the album. Which is the only way I would hear it, because I never would shell out money for this soulless bore-fest of pop cheese. It does nothing, goes nowhere and evokes no sort of emotion whatsoever. And call me crazy, but isn't that what music is all about?
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore's Sicko, is a very thought provoking and disturbing documentary. I enjoyed watching it, and found that it made a strong argument for universal health care. This documentary was extremely biased, however, is bias against the health care industry bad? One piece of information presented in this film is true, but there is another side to it that I feel needs to be mentioned. When Moore says that America is number 37 on the world health care list, that is true, and America should be ashamed of that statistic. However, what he does not say, is that there are 190 countries on the list. 37 is not great, but it is definitely near the top. Moore speaks highly of Cuban health care, but, on the same list that he cites earlier, Cuba is below the U.S, at number 39.<br /><br />Everything from HMO's benefiting from making people die, to the cost of prescription drugs, to the french government doing laundry for its citizens, Sicko covers a wonderful range of information about health care. Wherever you stand on the universal health debate, you will get something out of this documentary. Whether it confirms what you already believe, gives you a new perspective on the topic, or makes you question what you believe, you will learn something from Sicko.<br /><br />I highly recomend that everyone watch this great documentary. Be sure to watch it aware of the bias, though. If you watch this documentary objectively, you will get more out of it than if you just accept everything that it says as complete fact. I enjoyed watching it, it moved along at a comfortable pace, and was very informative. You will not regret watching this documentary.<br /><br />I only have one question about Sicko. Did Michael Moore really do that outside of Guo Tanamo Bay?
B0011UF79C|5.0|In the not so distant future, parents can select the best attributes their child will have.  You and your wife decide to have a child - you go and get your DNA mixed, you remove all of the bad traits like poor eyesight, short height, autism, heart disease propensity, etc and you wind up with your perfect child, 10 fingers, 10 toes, 180 IQ, the heart of a racehorse, etc.  These children are the best that humanity can be and the best that two parents can produce.  In the future upper middle class children and upper class children are almost entirely conceived in this engineered fashion and although discrimination based on eugenics is illegal, it is commonly practiced in this future with those who are not born in the genetically engineered fashion being relegated to inferior jobs.<br /><br />The movie is about two brothers, one who was brought into the world in this accepted fashion and a second who was conceived in the traditional way (though s*x) and the love of their parents.  Almost immediately after birth, the parents notice that their engineered son is superior in so many ways to their other son but their god-child has an indomitable spirit so much so that he crawls his way through all obstacles and and makes some of the greatest sacrifices imaginable for the shot at being a member of a prestigious astronaut corps.<br /><br />In this story Jude Law, a privilaged rich guy who becomes incapacitated overseas unbeknownst to the authorities sells his identity to Ethan Hawke in order for Jude to continue his rich lifestyle while Ethan works at the astronaut corporation. In the story Jude's genetics said he would be the best swimmer in the world but only earns a silver medal and overall Jude is the epitome of that guy whose pedigree says he should be #1 at everything but isn't - probably because he rests too much on that pedigree.<br /><br />The movie has a murder mystery build into it to keep things interesting as Ethan tries to avoid detection as an In-Valid while still keeping himself as the selectee for the Saturn Mission which he has been selected for.<br /><br />I won't kid you, this movie is drama.  Its fairly slow paced but in a deep way that you can keep up with. The Acting by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, and Gore Vidal are impressive and first rate.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a story about how the human soul and spirit cannot be quantified into the code of DNA and how we as humanity are more.  Its definitely a deep movie but if you've ever felt put down by others or that you don't belong somewhere, watch this movie and it will quickly change your mind.the selectee for the Saturn Mission which he has been selected for.

B000000I02|4.0|Trippy tracks taking thrust-worthy compositions akin to the committed jams of a Soft Machine mixed with more layered weirdness of Gentle Giant synthesized a worthwhile psychedelic-progressive excursion in the face of so much less-inspired experimentation going on around the time.

0316017922|5.0|This is a great book; like Machiavelli's The Prince, like Nietzsche's On Genealogy of Morals, or Foucault's Madness and Civilization.     Though there are similarities in style to Gladwell's previous two books, Outliers is much more than those earlier efforts because in tackling the question of what is success, Gladwell opens a real mine-field of problems.    For example:  > if success is where you came from, what is it in society which is assisting / preventing more 'successful' evolutions?)   > success in the book is a very simple model of success -- success at a role, success at a position, success in accomplishing a thing -- but he does not try to access the question of \\"Are the successful, really successes?  do they consider themselves as such?\\"  > price of success when is worth it, when is it not?  If a culture needs to change to be more successful is that worth the price?  Or would it  better to allow for cultural specializations (like work specializations)?    But like all really great books, the questions / debate that it opens is so much more important than the answers conclusively proven.
0061649694|5.0|Coraline / 978-0-06-164969-1<br /><br />I was unaware of the existence of this wonderful book prior to the existence of the \\"Coraline\\" movie. Having seen the movie on a lark one weekend and being instantly blown away by how incredibly deep and creepy it was, I rushed on to Amazon to buy the book. Hence a lot of this review will be for people like me, who came to the book AFTER they watched the movie.<br /><br />This slim little page-turner grips the reader powerfully from the beginning and hold on until the very end, likely much later that same evening. I was deeply impressed at the integrity maintained between the book and the movie - the changes made for the movie version seemed fully in the spirit of the original book, such as the seamless addition of \\"Wybie\\" who serves as a foil to Movie-Coraline's personality, which is a little stronger and a little older than Book-Coraline's.<br /><br />When I try to compare this wonderful book to another in memory, I cannot help but describe Coraline as a creepier, more horrific descendant of Alice in Wonderland - Coraline contains the same detached-dreamy feel as our young heroine trips quietly through a fantasy world that threatens to turn and devour her at any moment. The narration is delightfully subtle, never imposing, and maintains a light, tripping touch which strikes the perfectly balanced tone, allowing both reader and heroine to remain calm in the face of the complete horror of being trapped in a world where a powerful creature seeks to devour your very soul. Gaiman particularly makes good use turning the ordinary into the macabre, such as the two actresses entwined in a single misshapen being.<br /><br />The characters are realistic and warming - of particular amusement is the scene when Coraline reports her missing parents to the police and the officer tenderly recommends a warm glass of milk for her nightmares. Both heroes and villain show a shocking depth of meaning and character in such a short book - the Beldam is a textbook study of a needy, vampiric sort of person who feels they must be \\"completed\\" by the love and devotion of another, who can never live up to their demanding and impossible expectations. And the cat is...well, a perfect cat. With no names, because (as is explained) cats do not need names to come to dinner. Book-Coraline, unlike Movie-Coraline, is younger, smaller, quieter, less rebellious, and a little bit more frightened by her surroundings, but her spirit is the same, her determination to save herself and her parents is unyielding. Truly, I think this may be the best book-movie adaptation I've ever seen, and I highly recommend the book to anyone who enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardolldy, vampiric sort of person who feels they must be \\"completed\\" by the love and devotion of another, who can never live up to their demanding and impossible expectations.

B001UOVP1S|4.0|Ok I loved Soundgarden and Audioslave as much as anyone, but CC wanted to make an album that was different from what he has previously done.  I respect that he wanted to do something different.  I at first was dissappointed by how different the music was on Scream until I actually listened to the whole entire songs and then I started to have a different opinion.  If you are expecting the same sound of Audioslave or Soundgarden you will be disappointed but if you want to listen to an artist branching out than give this album a try.  Listen to the whole album not 30 seconds of each song to form an opinion.  This album, and CC desearves more than a 1-2 star review.
B001PJ7TUE|4.0|Like most who have posted I am a long time Prodigy fan. I heavily criticized their previous CD: Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned for it's new (scream punk) approach that some liked others didn't.<br /><br />And now we have Invaders must die.<br /><br />Hmmm let see... its...<br /><br />Cyber-punk incarnate, It's a blend of their new punk image with a mix of their rave/techno past. With hints of chip music (which I like) and old school recycled 90s dance riffs (like streets of rage).<br /><br />Overall I love most of it... the innovation is there without alienating their original fan base.<br /><br />The songs I like:<br /><br />Omen<br />Worlds on Fire<br />Take me to the Hospital<br />Warriors Dance<br />Thunder<br />Stand Up<br /><br />In pretty much that order.<br /><br />It's a solid CD and it's a personally exciting because no band has the same formula as prodigy. They are unique but consistant in their ramping and (beat-breaks)&(breakbeats). The songs warp, glitch(figuratively speaking), with unexpected twists but leave you with a ultimately satisfying adventure.

There was a garden fork sticking out of the dog.\\"         Thank you for shedding light on this much overlooked disease. I worked as a teacher's aide with special kid's like this... and a lot of people in our great country have no idea what high functioning autism is...(Steven Spielberg has it, I think)     Meet 15 year old Christopher Boone,he loathes the color yellow(so much so that he covers all of his yellow and brown food with hot sauce and has a bad day if he sees too much of these colors).(He refers to them as back days)   He absolutely hates being hugged kissed or touched, esp on the shoulder.   The neighbor's poodle has been murdered and she blames it on Christopher , who decides to find the culprit to justice so he can be vindicated.His dad warns him to just let it lie and leave well enough alone, and Christopher can't figure out why.   He relates to animals quite well, but has a hard time relating to humans and the varying emotions.   In his mind there are happy sad and angry.   He definitely is not a dim bulb,( he is in AP Math)The TV is working fine in his head there is just black and white, that is how he sees the world.   I like how this kid puts little pictures and graphs to illustrate what he is trying to say but cannot find the words.   He also is a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes and appreciates Sherlock's logical responses to things and daydreams he is just like him.   This book clearly illustrates how hard it is to take of a children with serious a disease no matter how great of a parent you are.     I love how his Dad tries so very hard to care of him, and shields him from the hard truth sometimes , and I love love his teacher Siobhan? She is a special lady and one of his few human friends..   It is a little disturbing because Christopher hates being touched so much .( He is scared someone will hurt him) that he lashes out and fights people and sometimes he wets himself when he is frightened.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|We live in a time when rock and roll is a business. It has been all of my remembered life and has steadily become a more corporate and lifeless entity since my birth in 1984.    I listen to music and rarely think \\"these guys really understand the concept of expressing emotion through music.\\" Even more rare is saying it when I hear rock music. I love rock music, and I've always been a rock guy. But it's just dead for lack of a better term. There's still some good stuff out there, but as a genre, I feel like people make the same safe crap over and over.    This is NOT a safe album. This was the most insane move that Chris Cornell could make, and probably the last thing I thought I would hear out of the man. And that is why I love it so much.    These are not the kind of songs the majority of Cornell's fanbase is going to want to hear. Most of them seem to want him to reunite with Soundgarden or Audioslave and I really wouldn't be mad if that happened. Both bands personified rock and roll to me. They were both perfect in their own way.    But here's why I am as happy with it not happening: this is where the artist's heart is. This old Monty Python tagline prepares you for life as much as it does this album: \\"...and now for something completely different.\\"    This album is just a sonic ride. Fantastic. It - to me - represents an open ended version of music. One that takes a very open mind, but a very well-constructed piece of work. All of Cornell's trademarks are present and so are Timbaland's. This is what music should be about. Taking risks, collaborating, and caring enough to get it right.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I watch this DVD over and over again. I can recite everyone's dialogue and I'm in love with Matthew McFayden. Watch the extras feature. The sisters are delightful. This is just the best. The costumes, the cinematography, the witty banter...I love it all.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Too intelligent for middle America. Zack Synder's Watchman is much better than Star Trek and many other big hits this year. A faithful adaptation of Alan Moore's much beloved graphic novel and a visual tour de force.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|First of all, everyone who says that they were expecting something else...you all need to get over yourselves and put away your egos. This album isn't perfect, but Cornell's voice still sounds great and actually fits with the beats. I've been a longtime fan of all of his stuff. I own all Soundgarden and Audioslave albums. I own both of his earlier solo albums and I own the album by Temple of the Dog. He's been my favorite voice of rock ever since I first heard \\"Black Hole Sun.\\" I already knew  what to expect from this album. I knew he was working with Timbaland and that this album was going to be an experiment of sorts. There are some tracks that don't work too well for me, but I love the title track. I'll take this new Cornell over no Cornell anytime. People just don't understand musicians and how they reach a certain point in their lives where they feel they've done everything they can and they want to try something fresh. But I'm usually different from everyone else anyway. I subscribe to contrary public opinion. If everyone says bet one way, I say bet the other way.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out to this video every other day for the past three months, it has worked great.  I started the  level 3 workout after first month and have been doing it since.  This week though i switched back to level two because i was getting a little to used to the work out.  And the level two kicked my butt.

B001MW0J2O|5.0|Ever hear the one about the kid who learned how to fly a MQ-9 Reaper (that's a plane) before learning to ride a bicycle? Yeah, me either, but I did hear the one about the Animal Collective album that every college freshman loved before digesting Remain In Light or Another Green World. Loved before they even heard it.    Okay, okay, let me steady myself. For starters, Merriweather Post Pavilion (a studio album named after an outdoor concert venue) is a perfectly good album that has many perfectly great moments. Is it a great album that warrants underground hysteria? Ehh ... we'll address the actual tunes later, I'm more so concerned with the surprising reception the record has seen. I find it difficult to believe that an album this complex, this strange, this abstract and, I'll say it, this unlistenable has been met with such enthusiasm by so many young ears. Have our collective tastes really become so complex and sophisticated? Can we expect to hear \\"Bluish\\" at future wedding receptions? I'll say no more on this subject, save for one final question for this Pitchfork-fueled world of sound: Do all these young listeners really like the music on Merriweather, or do they just like how special they feel while listening to the hip album of early 2009?    There have always been albums like this. Obvious ones like Bitches Brew and the abovementioned Remain In Light come to mind - even Radiohead's still recent Kid A. The best thing about this particular eccentric record (I overheard someone describe it as \\"Pet Sounds playing through a dishwasher\\") is that you can't tell if the artists behind the music are more so musicians or just dudes with crazy ideas, powerful computers and deep record collections. The sound here is much more produced than played, even prompting some publications to call it an official \\"electronic\\" album, rather than the \\"indie rock\\" and \\"experimental rock\\" tags the band has seen in the past. But don't get confused, this is oddly organic sounding music we're talking about. Futuristic, sure, but still organic.    Everything sounds mushy - almost gooey to the ears. Remember when you were told not to mix your Play-Doh as a kid, but did anyhow? What did you get? Brown Play-Doh, right? Merriweather is just that, brown Play-Doh. The fellas behind the Collective - led by David \\"Avey Tare\\" Portner and Noah \\"Panda Bear\\" Lennox - mix so many influences, sounds, genres and even production styles on this record that their product proves itself to be more so a clever and unique packaging of ideas than a collection of songs. A very 21st Century record, indeed. As wild and weird as past Animal Collective albums have been, Merriweather is their strangest and most complex release yet that actually works as music (as opposed to experiments-on-record), melting through speakers as an artful progression of the sound 2007's great Strawberry Jam presented.    Buy hey, misplaced love of college freshman everywhere be damned, the Animals make their crazy ideas work in a way that sets new standards for books - rarely has an album this challenging and original seen such widespread comsumption. Held together with hooks, memorable (if usually nonsensical) lyrics and lingering backdrops that utilize pulsing loops and heavily layered production that melts from one idea to another in surprising ways, these tunes will embrace your inner-most art start after enough listens. Like Panda Bear's 2007 hype gatherer, Person Pitch, Merriweather Post Pavilion is a complex cut-and-paste epic that, if given enough time and heard by seasoned ears, should not only sound wholly original, but also be a tolerable - maybe even rewarding - listen. Ground breaking and listenable - that's hard to do these days. Just ask the noise band kids and, well, anyone who has released a high-concept album since OK Computer was born. (Greg Locke)
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Why is Microsoft not adding BR drive to Xbox 360?    Because proprietary optical media is already obsolete.  Televisions will all have internet connections and built in DVR's in less than a handful of years, and can wirelessly stream HD video from content servers in the house.    The real \\"next generation\\" of video is not Blu Ray disc, a construct of the studios that will never catch on like DVD as a format.    Give us digital format that we can pick the original, or a menu of 'enhancements' to ultimately 'publish' our own favorite version.    Because i must say some of the shots in the revised trilogy are better than the original.   Some parts of the originals were stupid as hell (re: anything with Ewoks in it) so they aren't exactly 'holy scripture.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|Yes let's get it out of the way - I am a big Soundgarden, Audioslave, and Chris Cornell solo fan. However I tried to be open minded about this album.    One great thing about Chris Cornell has always been that his music differed greatly from the average run-of-the-mill swill being pushed by top 40 radio stations. But with Scream he seems to be fulfilling a desire to be a \\"pop star\\" like Justin or Britney. It seems much more like \\"Timbaland featuring Chris Cornell\\" rather than the other way around.     I trusted Chris when he said this was some of his best work. I even listened to it 3-4 times from start to finish. I think I gave it a fair chance.     It's a decent effort, and I do enjoy some of the blippy synth stuff as well as the track-to-track transitions - but I was expecting much better from such an accomplished and talented artist.
B000002HEM|5.0|Great deal that arrived in no time at all.  I couldn't be happier with the quality or service.
B000NVIGC0|4.0|Wilco have been so long discussed and written about that, truthfully, there's probably nothing left to say that hasn't already been bickered over to death. Yes, they are shape-shifters, they always have been. Sure, helmsmen Jeff Tweedy has his share of personal and professional problems, but this everyman grief has also often been the fuel for some of the finest songs of our time. And their new album, Sky Blue Sky, is a boring, uninspired, simple adult contemporary record that's ready made for Barnes and Noble display fixtures. Or, wait, maybe it isn't. Maybe, just maybe, it's a grower. And maybe classifying something as \\"adult,\\" isn't a bad thing. That is, if what you're really meaning to say is \\"mature.\\" Or \\"seasoned.\\" Or \\"sophisticated.\\" Wilco arrive on Sky Blue Sky as all of these things. Especially sophisticated.     The rumors are true, at first blush Sky Blue Sky seems a bit too straightforward, boring and clear-cut; but live with it for a week and you'll soon find that it's actually none of those things to the core. No, it probably didn't max out studio soundboards or take months to mix. And yes, most of the songs were recorded live in the studio with little or no overdubs or Pro Tools tweaking. Do you have a problem with that? If so, you might want to go back and listen to A.M. and Being There. Now those were simple, albeit great, records. But they weren't mature or seasoned or sophisticated. Then again, they didn't follow creative juggernauts like Summerteeth, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost is Born, so really, who was counting?    While touring in support of the band's Grammy-winning fifth official studio album, A Ghost is Born, Wilco became something different they they'd ever been before: collaborative. They'd recently added legendary avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to their line-up, and as the show tally grew and grew, Tweedy became more and more comfortable with Cline's interpretations of the band's catalog. This new dynamic, one would have to assume, cracked the Tweedy shell, and consequently opened the doors for a more collaboration dynamic. A year or so later the band - drummer Glenn Kotche, pianist Mikael Jorgensen, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, longtime bassist John Stirratt, Tweedy and Cline - hit their stride while on the road. The shows sounded bigger and more powerful than ever before, and, judging by the release of their first live album, Kicking Television, they knew they'd become something else. Something most bands never become. They'd become pros. Masters.    Around this time new songs with names like \\"Walken,\\" \\"What Light\\" and \\"Impossible Germany\\" - all of which are included on Sky Blue Sky's track list - started popping up. Songs that sounded so classic that most fans initially figured them for covers. Songs that sounded like they were meant to be. Songs that only one in a million bands are capable of coming up with, if that. Songs that built on what the band had accomplished recently with tracks like \\"Hummingbird\\" and \\"Theologians.\\"    After U2-like delays Sky Blue Sky was finally out there, streaming on the band's website for free. Reviews started trickling in, most of which used all the same language: boring, uninspired, slow, insipid and unimaginative, to name just a few, were words every reviewer seemed intent to throw around. This seemed odd, considering songs like \\"What Light\\" and \\"Walken\\" had already received gobs of gushing acclaim. Could it be true? Had Wilco finally lost their edge? Were the Steve Vai rumors true? Had Wilco really put out their version of a bad-era Mark Knopfler record?    After a few listens it seemed possible. Tweedy's lyrics had gone from playfully cryptic and dark to straightforward and hopeful. The song structures seemed derivative of bands like The Eagles and whatever breezy SoCal bands come to mind, as opposed to Neu! or Radiohead or Sonic Youth or even Harry Nilsson. It seemed that Wilco had put on their slippers, sat on their couches and tapped out of the creative world they'd sat at the top of for nearly a decade.     Then it sets in: the guitar riffs and bouncy piano on \\"You Are My Face;\\" the imagery-drenched poetic verses of \\"Sky Blue Sky;\\" the improbable mini-movements spliced within \\"Shake It Off;\\" the Nilsson-meets-Newman pop intellect of \\"Hate It Here;\\" and, of course, the instant classics \\"Either Way,\\" \\"Impossible Germany,\\" \\"Walken\\" and \\"What Light.\\" It's all there, the expert musicianship, the long-labored lyrics, the textures, the vocals, the heart, the soul and the swagger. Wilco have done what they always do: they've put out one of the best albums of the year. Maybe even the best. Certainly no other album in 2007 will have as many undeniable classics.    It's a timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class. It's exactly what Wilco should be; anything else would come off as either played out or irresponsible, considering their talent and amazing live shows. Sure, they could release a progressive spirited album full of layers and layers of sound, but why do that when all your players play so clean and efficiently? What would be the point? When asked why he stopped layering his albums with guitar track after guitar track, Built to Spill's Doug Martsch claimed that he was finally comfortable enough with his skill that he didn't need to over-bake his work anymore. Like Wilco, Martsch recorded Built to Spill's recent album, You In Reverse, live in the studio without relying on overdubs and extensive production. And that's it, Wilco no longer need a crutch. Jeff Tweedy has finally found players good enough to keep up with his vision, and the result is a lean, mean album named Sky Blue Sky. The result is an album that will, possibly unlike some of their other work, still sound as good as ever in 20 years. The result is what just might be the best album of 2007; that is, if you give it the time it demands. (Greg Locke)
B001UOVP1S|5.0|Chris Cornell is golden.  Pop, rock, grunge or alternative he can do it all.  That's what makes him an artist.  Some people want to stereotype him and say he's only supposed to make rock/grunge music?  Why?  Because that's what you are comfortable with?  You think Chris did you wrong? Get over it, he makes music cause that's what he loves and it's awesome.<br /><br />He has an unparalleled voice that can carry in almost any genre of music, maybe it's not your style but oh well. His music isn't about you anyway.<br /><br />I think if you are a music lover and a Chris Cornell fan, you not only can accept this work but totally appreciate and enjoy it.  I'm not a huge pop music fan but I can appreciate all his music efforts on this album and I would recommend it to pop and Cornell fans alike!<br /><br />I've been a fan since I was a young teen and he's got a \\"part of me\\" in any music style he creatively explores!  Rock on Chris, rock on...
B001QB9H1K|2.0|I've enjoyed and bought all that Jason has stared in.  But his co-star Natalya Rudakova might be the most unattractive women to<br />ever star in a major motion picture.  No acting skills and a look that can kill. It is hard just looking at her!  Because of her I COULDN'T spend the $25.00 for the blu-ray instead I rented it and closed my eyes whenever she appeared on screen.  No doubt this is her only film and hopefully her last!  One only wonders who high on the food chain does she know in Hollywood to get that part?
B000001ELF|3.0|I have a lot of trouble seeing why people think this is the best of the four solo albums. There are many problems with this album. For one thing many of these songs have lyrics that a first grader could write, Ace Frehley is an excellent guitarist, but no amount of good guitar playing is going to make up for the fact that the lyrics and stink. Also as many have said in other reviews Ace has no talent for singing.    Now for the good parts. New York Groove is a very catchy song with some good guitar work, and it is one of Mr. Frehley's better attempts at singing. The other good song is Fractured Mirror which is a very good instrumental. I have enormous respect for Ace Frehley's work and for many of his songs from regular KISS albums, but this album is not as good.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|The first band to ever officially release a Platinum-bound album before even finalizing their cover art (let alone going to the press), Radiohead rushed their first self-released album, In Rainbows, to their fans via the Internet less than three weeks after announcing they'd finished recording. They did it this way, sadly (and smartly), as a reaction to the currently hopeless state of the music industry. They also did it this way, one would assume, because they knew they had their fourth classic album on their hands. They did it this way because, frankly, they're Radiohead, and they do things differently.    Though consumers will be able to eventually acquire a copy of the band's haunting seventh LP in one of a few various \\"official\\" forms in due time, a name-your-price download is the proemial format.  That goes for not just the music media, but also for the fans, who for one get to hear an album before it's reviewed. As for Rainbows' 10 songs, well, let's just say they're good, but that's expected, right? Big ideas demand big results, right? How's this: even when compared to Radiohead's mostly great catalog, these songs are worth celebrating.    The one thing that had been crippling Thom Yorke and Co. - and thereby muddying up their output - were the ever-looming expectations of living up to their signature album, OK Computer. Here, for the first time since that landmark album, Radiohead don't seem to care about expectations. They're not trying to reinvent the wheel (Kid A) or please fans (Hail to the Thief), they're just being Radiohead. They're not worrying about trends, deep conceptual themes or worldly relevance, they're simply playing in a band again, same as it ever was.    Opening In Rainbows is a distorted drum machine loop that works as a fixed backbone for the excellent \\"15 Step.\\" Guitars, keyboards, various vocal layers, thrumming ambiance and live drums come in and out, building and bottoming for what is ultimately their best composition (\\"There There\\"aside) since Kid A. Next up is the energetic \\"Bodysnachers,\\" a complex rocker that Radiohead and only Radiohead could come up with. Guitars (yes, real deal guitars) tease and tickle - both suble and rollicking - before announcing the official return of Radiohead, the best band on the planet, somewhere around the 3:33 mark. Not quite OK Computer- or The Bends-level guitarplay, but close enough.    Yorke's soulful vocals (which are better here than ever before), a strong inclination for thick, rhythmic Krautrock moodiness and an often less-than-full sound mark just three of the new tools Radiohead incorporate here. Really though, In Rainbows simply sounds like a band who have finally discovered how to operate within the confines of what they do best without feeling the need for grand gestures of massive style overhauls. Though the whole of In Rainbows very clearly sounds like the band responsible for Kid A and Hail to the Thief, closer \\"Videotape\\" is the only obvious fan pleaser (think \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"True Love Waits\\"). The thing is: it's good. Very good. Good enough, you'd have to assume, that it made the final cut over the eight forthcoming b-sides the band has already promised.    And let's not forget \\"Reckoner,\\" a song they originally wrote in 1997. The best song of 2007? Well, it's at least very close. Within the sweep of the band's most typical set of tools - subtle melodic guitar, entranced vocal harmonies, sprinkled piano licks, strings, calming machine-gun drums, etc. - Radiohead do what they do best: construct. It's all there, the details, the vocals, the lyrics and even the guitars. Everything you'd expect from Radiohead - including their inventivness - plays a part in the all-around specialness that is In Rainbows.    Also important to discuss with any Radiohead album is production value. To the dismay of many bored-but-loyal fans, In Rainbows utilizes longtime Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich. Known for his ability to twist just about anything into an epic (including crappy Paul McCartney albums), Godrich's treatment here is thankfully a bit less in-your-face. Rather than melting everything into a potpourri of swirling sound, he's finally letting things pop. He's layering, but only 30 or so tracks per song, as opposed to the 100-plus heard on the band's last four albums.    About as minimalist as Radiohead gets these days, In Rainbows is still huge, thick and vast, but without the Thief-like sheen this long-labored, fragile set of compositions shine for what they are, brooding . Brightly. Yorke's soars more than ever and Ed O'Brien and Jonny Greenwood's guitars (at least when they choose to really play them) are ablaze. But the key here is the band's unrivaled knack for structure. As was the case with OK Computer, In Rainbows is fast-thinking, moving from idea to idea seamlessly, leaving in its tracks a deceivingly complex batch of accessible prog-rock songs.    Due to how In Rainbows was released, it's bound to go down in rock geek history as one of the pivotal moments of the current transitional download era. Everything about how the album's release was handled is interesting, and, with any luck, it just might scare the fleeting corporate set straight. Err ... half-straight. Thankfully for fans In Rainbows is not just an album with a story, but a great album with and unthinkably great story. File this one right net to OK Computer under \\"landmark.\\" (Greg Locke)
0198326769|5.0|By now you probably know the premise of this book:  set in WWII Germany, a nine year old boy whose father is a commandant in the Nazi party moves with his family to Auschwitz, where his father has been put in charge of the infamous concentration camp.<br /><br />There aren't too many new ways to tell this story, but author John Boyne found a unique perspective here.  Everything about this story is from the viewpoint of Bruno, the nine year old German boy.  While it is fairly easy for you, the reader, to put together the puzzle pieces, we have the advantage of knowing history and knowing what atrocities occured at Auschwitz.  Bruno, of course, does not fully understand and this is his story.<br /><br />This novel is simply stunning in it's simplicity and power.  I never saw the ending coming and it just blew me away.  After I turned the last page, I set the book down in my lap and just sat there amazed for a good fifteen minutes.  Two weeks later, I'm still thinking about this book.  I can't get over how powerful it is and I'm recommending it to everyone I know.<br /><br />It's not necessarily a child's book, despite the youthful narrator.  I'd say it might qualify as a young adult's book since they are certainly old enough to understand the powerful ending.<br /><br />Certainly, all adults should read this one.  Then it's up to you to decide what age is appropriate for your children to read it.<br /><br />Do NOT miss this book!
B000SNUMCU|5.0|Nightwish's Dark Passion Play is by far the band's greatest work to date.It is an astonishing musical masterpiece and is nothing short of being completely brilliant.I absolutely love the new lead singer Anette Olzon,she is the perfect choice to replace Tarja Turunen.I will miss Tarja,she is an awesome vocalist.Anette is like a breath of fresh air for Nightwish.She has more of a natural metal sounding female voice than Tarja had.Although many critics and diehard fans may disagree with this review,what you really need to do is give Anette a chance to make her mark with this terrific band.I know that it hurts to lose an original lead singer and many will not accept any replacement at all whatsoever.I once felt that way about the band Journey,when Steve Perry was fired and shown the door.He was replaced by a new lead singer named Steve Augeri.I then wrote Journey off and refused to listen to anything new that they produced.That mindset all changed when by chance,I heard one of Journey's new songs.I liked what I had heard that day.So I decided to go see Journey live in concert when they came to town.Boy,am I glad that I did!Steve Augeri was a perfect replacement for Steve Perry!If you had came to the concert blindfolded,you would have swore that Steve Perry was up there singing the vocals.I've been a Journey fan again ever since!Another similar incident,is when VanHalen fired David Lee Roth and replaced him with Sammy Hagar.I scoffed at that move at first(even though I loved Sammy on his own!),but later on,I realized that Sammy was an excellent choice to replace Dave.Sammy blew me away with his vocals when I seen him live playing with VanHalen!With all that being said,Nightwish's loyal following needs to do the same with the new lead singer Anette Olzon.She does not sound like Tarja,but by her own right,Anette is an incredible singer with her own metal style.I back Anette 100%,she has my total approval as a replacement.Dark Passion Play is a must buy and I recommend this CD to everyone.Metal fans,just throw it in the cd player and crank it up!You will not be disappointed!Nightwish lives on!CD to everyone.Metal fans,just throw it in the cd player and crank it up!You will not be disappointed!Nightwish lives on!

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|Insupposable bit of reverie that it may be, I daydream of Peter Buck and Mike Mills showing up at Michael Stipe's door sometime soon after the failed tour that followed the release of R.E.M.'s most recent album, 2004's impressively pathetic Around the Sun. Buck, fire in his eyes, fumbles Stipe into a headlock, rendering him immobile on the front porch while Mills shoots rubber bands and flips paper footballs at the famously mumbly singer's famously bald head. In the driveway sits a pickup truck full of electric guitars, all of which Buck threatens to set on fire and roll into the Stipe Mansion unless his old friend Michael agrees to do at least one and a half of two things: 1) fires new age dreamer/producer Pat McCarthy; 2) finally lets Buck and Mills make the rock album their band had been promising for years.    Later, probably in the café located in the private art gallery inside Stipe's house, the three sit down, have a few drinks, arm wrestle and talk about the now long-gone good `ol days of Bill Berry beats. \\"Lets make an album that looks and sounds like something a college or indie or whatever band would make,\\" Stipe finally says in his deep voice, as if it's his own idea. \\"Lets make something Bill would like.\\" Buck shifts awkwardly in his chair, eyebrows raised, snorting. \\"Short songs with backing vocals,\\" chirps Mills, glasses fogged from his steaming Caffè macchiato. \\"Guitars,\\" barks Buck, \\"lots of guitar.\\" \\"Synths,\\" adds Stipe before pausing. \\"Burried synths,\\" he rescinds.    Okay, enough dreaming - time to get to bizness. Accelerate, the aptly titled 14th R.E.M. studio album, was recorded - according to Stipe - faster than anything the band has done in 20 years. It's a guitar-filled, somewhat minimalist-minded rock n' roll album that touches on many of the band's hallmarks. No lost-but-ambitious McCarthy production on this accelerated slice of edge - nope, not a drop. Producer Jacknife Lee (U2, Green Day) maintains a quiet but consistent presence, hisproduction offering a consistency not heard on an R.E.M. album since Automatic for the People. Accelerate is an expertly made album that looks and sounds like it belongs on the \\"employee picks\\" shelf alongside Spoon and Zumpano albums in hipster record stores - though it'd be filed, genetically speaking, under \\"influential,\\" not \\"influenced.\\"    \\"Hollow Man,\\" one of Accelerate's many standout tracks, reads almost like a late night memo from Stipe to Mills and Buck: \\"You had placed your trust in me / I went upside down / I emptied out the room in 30 seconds flat / I can't believe you held your ground.\\" Or, maybe, a letter to R.E.M.'s loyal fans, subconscious as it may be. The truth is, R.E.M. hasn't been good enough to call themselves R.E.M. for over a decade now, but this album, this guitar-loving indie-pop album, is a gem of a record that even sounds as if it could've been released after the last great R.E.M. album, New Adventures in Hi-Fi.    Despite the wandering failures of their post-Hi-Fi past, R.E.M. are still a strong band who know how to put together strong, memorable pop songs that sound like no one else. The major element of that formula, of course, is Stipe, who sings and writes like no one else. His voice and delivery through Accelerate sound like longtime fans would hope, while Buck - who has always created excellent music, be it with this band, the Minus 5 or Robyn Hitchcock - is as on point as he has been in years, sounding - similar to Stipe's allure here - exactly like fans hope he would, though maybe a bit louder and hungrier than he's been, possibly ever.    Not to burn the party down, but don't get too excited just yet - Accelerate is no Life's Rich Pageant, Document or Out of Time. Stipe's phrasing and spitfire deliver, Mills' backing vocals and Buck's post-jangle bounce riffs are all finely executed and very familiar, leaving only one real question: are these nearly written-off legends enjoying themselves while doing what they do best, or simply doing what they have to do to keep their career chugging along? Answer that question for yourself after a couple of accelerated spins and you'll know if these 11 new songs are ones you'll live with or, good as they are, just function as a fleeting reminder of better times.

When i learned that it was the last book of its series i was hesitat to read it because i was scared and still am of what i would find in the story. this is cause each book that came out gradually becme worse and was lacking in development~i personally think    im one of the young girls thats looking for a story~that theres a happy ending,  a fabtasy. but to an extent. theres a point when an illusion can be broken. though i haven`t read the book yet i have heard of the spoilers. i thought they were just pulling mi leg but no. when so many says it sucks, it means it sucks.    just from the spoilers i could tell it was too under developed. i think the author probably got wrapped up in the sales and the target were teenae girls. but there is an extent of believability.    the stuff like jacob imprinting a baby is kinda NOT appealing. i will read the book when i have time to pick it apart piece from piece and prepare for the disappointment for how under developed it was. though i will always remain a twiligt fan keeping the dreams of a teenage girl alive.

B000VS6P9Q|4.0|The idea of Bob Dylan allowing a bunch of mostly young indie rock types record their versions of his songs seems a bit unlikely, but then again so does the thought of the world's greatest songwriter acting in commercials for huge corporations like Victoria's Secret and Cadillac. While most of the time Dylan plays it distant and cold, just as any self respecting done-it-all legend should, he'll occasionally drop his rigorous façade and let someone peek in. The someone in question behind this 34-song collection - or so it seems - is film director Todd Haynes, the man responsible for such films as Velvet Goldmine, Far From Heaven and Corporate Ghost.    When word came out that Haynes had cast a bevy of actors - including Cate Blanchett, Christian Bale, Richard Gere and Heath Ledger, to play Dylan - people, especially the Dylan purists, started to worry. Though the film has yet to hit theatres nationwide, the press and trailers currently available imply that Haynes treated the film as more of a loose celebration of all-things-Dylan, rather than a story about the man himself. One listen to the sprawling I'm Not There soundtrack leaves the same impression. The songs here, many of which feature backing accompaniment from a super group called The Million Dollar Bashers, come off as a celebration. And not just any celebration, but a celebration played by some of the best bands of the current generation.    Television guitarist Tom Verlaine, Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley, Dylan bassist Tony Garnier, Wilco guitarist Nels Cline, legendary guitarist Smokey Hormel and Medeski, Martin and Wood key-man John Medeski join Sonic Youth guitar legend Lee Ranaldo in the aforementioned Million Dollar Bashers, the band responsible for giving the soundtrack legs to walk on. Fronting the Bashers throughout are Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam), Stephen Malkmus (Pavement), Karen O (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Verlaine himself. Additionally, Calexico back other artists on five songs, including Jim James(My Mourning Jacket), Iron & Wine, Roger McGuinn (The Byrds), Willie Nelson and Charlotte Gainsbourg, thus - along with the Bashers - offering a level of continuity not usually found on compilations featuring over 20 different artists.    Also along for the ride are Cat Power and her Memphis Band, Sonic Youth, Richie Havens, John Doe (X), Yo La Tengo, Mason Jennings, Los Lobos, Jeff Tweedy (Wilco), Mark Lanegan (Screaming Trees), Mira Billotte, Sufjan Stevens, Jack Johnson, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, The Hold Steady, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, The Black Keys, Marcus Carl Franklin, Bob Forrest and Antony and the Johnsons. Also included is the legendary (but never properly released) title track from the film in the form of it's original glory.    So there you have the facts. And while this album hardly plays through in a way that will satisfy everyone, it does attain the uncommon \\"something for everyone\\" element. My favorites, you ask? Sure. The Malkmus tunes with the Bashers, specifically \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" and \\"Maggie's Farm,\\" are - believe it or not - nearly as raucous and memorable as the originals. Sonic Youth's take on the title track also stands out, as do Jeff Tweedy's straight-ahead version of \\"Simple Twist of Fate,\\" the two Yo La Tengo tracks, Willie Nelson's \\"Senor,\\" and Iron & Wine's take on \\"Dark Eyes.\\" While some of the tracks, namely the cuts by Eddie Vedder, Cat Power, Mason Jennings and Los Lobos, feel a bit too much like cover band recordings, the bulk of I'm Not There is well worth your time, likely due to the excellent production throughout, especially the tracks handled by Joe Henry and Lee Ranaldo.    As much as I enjoyed this album, I have to admit that it hit the shelves pretty quickly. More than anything else, it has me dreaming of Dylan dropping everything and taking 10 or 11 new songs into the studio with The Million Dollar Bashers at his back and Joe Henry on the boards. Maybe even invite Dylan-superfan Ranaldo along for executive producer duties. Until then, we have I'm Not There, one of the better tribute albums you'll ever find. (Greg Locke)
B001O8C5KK|4.0|The very fact that this recording was made at all is a cause for celebration. The 2004 \\"Tristan und Isolde\\" was declared by EMI to be the last commercial recording of its kind; henceforth opera would be available only on DVD's of live performances - but here we are with a brand new \\"Madama Butterfly\\" performed by a top-rate cast and conductor. When he became the Royal Opera's Music Director in 2002, Pappano vowed to make recordings only with his resident forces, but being a pragmatist and no prima donna of the old school, he sensibly compromised his principles when the opportunity arose to make this recording in Rome. Given that an opera recording can incur costs approaching half a million pounds, it made sense to integrate the recording into the annual schedule of the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia. Overheads such as the hall, the recording studio and the orchestra itself were thus absorbed within the Accademia's budget and the project became commercially viable. Furthermore, the timing was right: had the current financial crisis hit earlier, or the recording schedule been delayed, one wonders if it would ever have got off the ground.<br /><br />So we have every reason to cheer and hope that so risky a venture as a new, complete, opera recording proves financially successful. I feel a certain pressure on me as a reviewer to be as positive as possible about this set - and, thankfully, that's not too hard. The indications are all good: the reigning EMI house diva Angela Gheorghiu has a particular affinity with Puccini; her voice has just the right plangency and morbidezza for his heroines. She has not sung the rôle on stage - but then, neither had Mirella Freni when she made her seminal version with Karajan - and indeed, she never did perform it live. German tenor Jonas Kaufmann is one of the two or three most sought-after on the circuit, with a voice of the kind of heft that is all too rare today. Antonio Pappano is proving to be the most dependable and successful of conductors; despite being only in mid-career he has already made a dozen opera recordings at a time when most conductors can only dream of so doing. Finally, the idea of returning a major Puccini recording to the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia has a nostalgic as well as a practical appeal: they were responsible for legion top-quality recordings in the 50's.<br /><br />So can I be sufficiently positive about this recording? Yes; but with some qualifications. Let's start with the obvious: the sound is spectacularly good; spacious, warm, and superior to any previous set - so much so that there is quite a lot of extraneous noise, especially if one listens through headphones: creaks, thumps, groans and cars accelerating all form a sonic underlay, so acute are the microphones. Balances are very good and the virtuosity of Pappano's orchestra is there for all to hear; there is energy and attack in plenty, in combination with some lovely gradation of dynamics. Little details and subtleties emerge under Pappano's direction; he has clearly re-thought the score and brought his customary zest to bear. Karajan's reading - my main reference point for comparison - is often longer breathed and grander, and the sound a little more plush, less pointed - but I haven't heard many complaints about either his conducting or the technical quality of the Decca recording.<br /><br />\\"Madama Butterfly\\" must stand or fall by the quality of its two principals, but I'll deal with the supporting cast first. All are more than adequate, yet each is bettered elsewhere. I have always thought that Robert Kerns's Sharpless, in the Karajan set, has been unfairly criticised for dullness; he has a pleasant voice and responds both wisely and sympathetically to the caddish Pinkerton's self-inflicted predicament. He is no Gobbi, whose nuanced vocalisation, apart from some strain in the upper reaches of his range, is near ideal in the 1954 recording conducted by Gavazzeni. Compared with both ofthese, Fabio Capitanucci is a bit of a bellower; he has a nice voice but little subtlety. As Suzuki, Enkelejda Shkosi is a little wobbly and matronly compared with Christa Ludwig, though her Flower Duet with Gheorghiu goes very well. Similarly, Cristina Reale's Kate reveals too much wobble in her few phrases. Gregory Bonfatti's Goro has one of those \\"cutting edge\\" character tenors which can grate on the ear; I much prefer Michel S&eacute;n&eacute;chal's silky insolence in the Karajan. Raymond Aceto's Bonzo is simply unacceptable; his uningratiating tone is as bad as I had remembered (from his Capellio in \\"I Capuleti e i Montecchi\\"); give me Marius Rintzler's noble sound any day. The chorus is excellent, especially the ladies accompanying Butterfly as they ascend the hill.<br /><br />Now to the raison d'être of this set: Gheorghiu's Butterfly. As with her recordings of \\"La Rondine\\" and \\"Tosca\\", both made before she had sung the parts on stage, this is her first essay at this most demanding of lyric-spinto rôles - although you would never guess it. She really lives the part and certain moments are unforgettably realised: the searing, surging despair of her \\"Ah! m'ha scordata?\\", the lovely, liquid portamenti in the love duet, the heart-rending cries of \\"Morta!\\" in \\"Sai cos'ebbe cuore\\" - as Sharpless observes, \\"Quanta piet&agrave;\\" indeed; she never fails to move. Even without quite having the vocal resources of some of her illustrious vocal forebears, she manages triumphantly the transition from fragile teenager to heart-broken wife and mother to tragic heroine. She cannot emulate the unearthly beauty of Mirella Freni's floated D-flat in the entrance aria - Gheorghiu's is not ideally steady - but she does almost everything else admirably. Her fans will want this set for her performance alone. (There is one puzzling little oddity, given the obvious time and trouble expended on this recording: Gheorghiu fluffs the words at the beginning of Act 2, saying \\"Perch&egrave; rispose\\" instead of \\"dispone\\". A negligible error - but why not re-take?)<br /><br />Finally, to Jonas Kaufmann's Pinkerton - and for me, here's the rub. I have greatly admired his singing, both live and on disc, although I was far less enthusiastic than some about his singing of the classic Italian tenor rôles on his recital disc; it seems to me that his timbre is far better suited to Weber, Wagner and Bizet's Don Jos&eacute; and I hear nothing here to change my mind. I miss the smile in the voice, the Italianate gleam, the seamless legato of a true Puccini tenor like Pavarotti in his prime. Kaufmann's hefty, baritonal sound is certainly thrilling and there is every justification for characterising the cruel, feckless Pinkerton as a bit of a brute. This, apparently, was Kaufmann's conception of Pinkerton as \\"cold, calculating\\"; it both suits his voice and explains why, according to reports, both Gheorghiu and Pappano were urging him to greater passion in the love music, but it robs Pinkerton of an essential vocal allure and the audience of any chance of suspending their condemnation of an essentially unattractive anti-hero. You have to believe that Pinkerton, as a \\"Yankee vagabondo\\", temporarily believes his own lies while he is serenading his new child-wife. In addition, I am perturbed by Kaufmann's apparent acquisition of a new vocal bad habit: he repeatedly injects little glottal sobs into what should be a seamless sound. Presumably he does this for emotive effect but too much of \\"les larmes dans la voix\\" becomes a tiresome tic. The top of his voice, although often thrilling, does not expand or caress in the manner of singers such as Bergonzi or Bj&ouml;rling, thus the climactic B-flat of \\"America for ever\\" is uncomfortable, the pianissimi can turn husky, and too many high notes are approached with that little bleat which disrupts the line. I still much enjoyed listening to his virile, impassioned sound, but I found his portrayal of Pinkerton a tad two-dimensional, and I hope that he will not let the glottal habit take root in his voice.<br /><br />The packaging of this set is a \\"2CD Limited Edition deluxe clamshell, [with] 152pp booklet, libretto, synopsis, liner notes, [and] photos\\". In other words, beautifully presented - although the way the booklet rattles inside the over-large box is a bit irritating. Coincidentally, this new recording was made in the 150th anniversary of Puccini's birth; it certainly does him honour but will not replace the Karajan in my loyalties.but why not re-take?)

0375826726|1.0|Seventeen-year-old farm boy, now Dragon Rider, Eragon and his blue dragon Saphira are back for a third installment of Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle - a fantasy series considered epic by many readers. I, however, was not so convinced. The continued stupidity of Eragon is about the only thing epic in this series.      Normally a fast reader, it took me a week and a half to get through the 745-page Brisingr. And even now I puzzle over what made it so darn long! The chapters mainly focus on the political struggles of the Varden and especially the dwarves - as if there wasn't enough of that in Eldest. And while the politics surrounding a war are definitely important, none of it contributes to Brisingr's supposed plot.       Wait - there was a plot?! If there was, I certainly missed it among the laughing soldiers who can't be killed - unless you stab them through the left nostril, their foot, or the armpit -, Eragon's conversing with the surrounding foliage and wildlife (yes, the ants are back), and Roran's constant doubting of his leadership qualities, as well as his dislike for killing. (Ironically, in one battle, he ends up slaying nearly two hundred people, and is seemingly unaffected by it afterwards, whereas he had occurring nightmares after other battles that CP found necessary to relate in detail.)      And if you hoped that there would be character development, you will be sorely mistaken. Eragon has elf abilities now, but he still passes out about every other chapter, and gets exhausted. Never mind he can punch straight through someone's stomach and not feel light-headed in the slightest after getting a compound fracture. He is still as whiny as ever, and his intelligence level hasn't gone up in the slightest.      There are a few moments with Arya where the reader sees a softer side of her, but they are few and far in between, and really do not contribute to her character at all. It just leaves the reader thinking \\"O-kay, so one moment she was sharingsentiments with Eragon around a campfire, and now she's slashing and hacking and acting as uppity as ever.\\"      I found Roran to be very tiring - particularly when he slew nearly two hundred men on his own while gushing blood all over the place. After that moment, he simply becomes a killing machine with a big warhammer in tow. For a while, CP shows signs that Roran may be able to use magic - which is demonstrated in a few nonsensical scenes where he tries to levitate a rock -, but that is left open for speculation. This may be because CP has plans for it in the fourth book, though.      About the only character(s) who develop are the Urgals! Urgals, people! That is sad! And even they are not as developed as one would hope. You don't get to see much into their culture - hopefully the fourth book will fix that - and they are still very much portrayed as hulking brutes with ram's horns and yellow eyes that go about grunting and roaring. This portrayal makes the character developments hard to take seriously (though none of this beats the part in Eldest where Eragon experiences the Urgal's childhood).      A good portion of this book focuses on the dwarves (wow, just like the last two!), and the majority of that is spent with the clan chiefs bickering back and forth about this and that, and one clan giving Eragon the evil eye because he's a Rider. The only redeeming quality during those many chapters is the Star Sapphire is repaired, and Eragon is attacked by ninja dwarves!      The battles should have offered some variation, but they didn't. One is so abrupt that I literally jumped in my seat. One moment the Varden are being merry and preparing for a wedding, and then BOOM! There's an army of non-pain-feeling laughing soldiers on the horizon! And - surprise, surprise -, the \\"evil\\" Murtagh shows up, and he and Eragon have their usual conversation that suspiciously resembles the ones Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker have.      The most disturbing thing I found about thatparticular battle was afterwards, everyone acted like nothing had happened, and they went back to being happy and merry.      The other two battles consist of Muscleman Roran and his skull-smashing hammer doing hundreds of baddies in. And the Varden siege resembles a role-playing game so much that you automatically wonder, \\"Did I save the game?\\" when a character enters a building.      What few plot twists the book has are so obvious that you feel like you've already read that part of the book. In fact, most of the book feels that way. Just think of the most obvious Star Wars-ish plotline twist and you have probably already figured it out.      In order to cover all of the horrible instances in Brisingr, I would have to write an essay. So in conclusion, if you have read the first two books, you have pretty much read Brisingr. And if you have seen Star Wars, you have read the Inheritance Cycle. Just replace some of the character names with Yoda, Obe won Canobe, Luke Skywalker, the Sith Lord, and Darth Vader!
0385338732|3.0|After reading a couple of very serious books I was looking for something light and fun to cheer me up and was recommended this Sophie Kinsella's book. I've never read any of her works and didn't expect too much. However I have to admit, I was a little disappointed. It was an easy and fast read, mostly entertaining, but not very funny or original. Nevertheless I did somewhat enjoy the book and will give SK another chance. Maybe her Shopaholic series is better?

B001TCNSOI|4.0|Very good movie with excellent acting.  I think it adequately portrayed the LAPD during that time period.  I found that the picture kept my attention throughout, because I'm known to fall asleep during movies.  If you are looking for a great movie for the night, pick this!

B000R7HY0K|2.0|I like Tarantino films, but he's beginning to recycle a bit too much. He used to take the best bits from classic film noir, ninja flicks, anime, 1940s crima drama, anime, and exploitation films of the 70s and turn the pieces into something new. But in Death Proof he's started recycling...himself. The film is predictible in its overblown largesse of violence and kitsch. *yawn*
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I say \\"surprise\\" because I was determined up front (as Cornell fan) to NOT like it because I was wary of the Timbaland connection.  But the more I'm hearing it, the more I'm liking it.  It certainly IS a departure for Cornell, but it's an exciting one.    Definitely worth owning.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Saw this in the store and bought it on impulse. I really wish I had read the reviews before buying this CD as it is pretty bad. There are some moments on this cd however, once it goes back into it's case it is never coming back out. We'll see if Chris can get any of his loyal fans back after this.
0743267478|2.0|....I hope.        I have to admit I'm truly baffled over the rave reviews of this book.  If this is the standard of contemporary high literature, we are truly in low times.      This piece is a study in crazed swings of direction, whether it be prose, character, mood, emotion....it's just too much.  Most characters are so incredibly one sided that they seem more like junior artists (i.e. one-sided extras) rather than fully-fleshed actors.  Is it any surprise that the two most-oft displayed actors are fairly trite depictions of a macho gay child molester and a narcissistic \\"Tragedy Queen\\"?    While I see that most readers were swayed by the overt emotional ploys of this text, I instead find myself rather angered by the silly stereotypes or the silly anti-stereotypes [and here, for the purpose of the long-winded reader, I quote]:         ...In the Hindi films I have seen, the prostitute heroine is inevitably a good-hearted girl who has been forced into the profession against her will.  At the end of the film the prostitute almost always commits suicide by consuming poison.  I wonder whether I have been brought to this whorehouse with a purpose.  Whether there is a heroine waiting for me behind this door.  Whether I am her hero, who is supposed to rescue her.  And whether I can alter the ending and prevent her death.    So not to spoil anything too much.  The prostitute in this novel is indeed good-hearted, and the \\"hero\\" does try to rescue her.    If this book is supposed to mirror a Bollywood film, I must confess ignorance and recant part of my critique.  However, even with that premise considered, the prose is only worthy of a decent submission to a college-level fiction course, but hardly Great Literature.    In conclusion, I have to wonder at a book whose thread is a quiz show, but whose fact are garnered from a knowledgeable \\"Maureen Travis for retrieving valuable reference information, and Google for doing the same electronically\\".      Even a college-level fiction course requires more research and development than mere URLs can provide.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|For her very first album she did amazing especially with that voice of her. i know she did better than most disney stars. anyway it was a good album and i liked it, she made really good songs on it
0061537934|5.0|What an amazing book with such a touching story!!! I laughed and cried through the whole book. Most books about dogs are told from the owners point of view, but thats what makes this book so wonderfully different is that its told from the dogs perspective. About his feelings and the amazing things dogs can sense (if only they could talk)! But this has a wonderful ending that made it even more special and different than any other book about a dog! I think I read it in about 2 days I couldn't put it down!! MUST READ!
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Chris, you have completely sold out...  I will never buy another album with your name on it ever again...  pethetic!
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|A wonderful Disney movie. The cats are adorable  and the animation is second to none.   A lovely movie featuring some classic stars   and clever storyline. In short, it's a timeless tribute  to the wonder of Disney.
B001FBSMF8|2.0|Chris Cornell you were my hero when you were in Soundgarden, you were my hero with your first solo album, you were my hero in Audioslave, you were even still my hero after your second solo album. Can you say mid-life crisis? Epic fail, a surefire disappointment to anyone who has followed your career.    His voice still sounds great, but thanks to Timbaland's cut and paste producing techniques, his background music sounds exactly like Nelly Furtado's Loose, or Justin Timberlake's Future Sex Love Sounds, or even that meaningless OneRepublic album.     Timbaland, you are not a great producer, you are simply a semi-talented hip hop producer in the right place at the right time. For those of you paying attention to Timbaland's producing, is it just me or does he seem to add himself saying \\"`ey\\" or \\"hey\\" into almost every single he releases, it doesn't matter whose song it is, he's on there saying something.
630218021X|5.0|I once saw this film plus, \\"The Devils,\\" and \\"Women in Love,\\" for a six hour marathon in France. I fell in love totally with Ken Russell, a brillant director with such a genius for the visual and the emotions portrayed by characters. This film has been panned by people who just do not have any true knowledge of great film making. To me, as Madame Von Meck says in the film, (about Tchaikovsky- about Russell) he is a genius. His music (films) will live on way beyond all of us. The pity is this film is not in DVD- I think it is a deliberate censorship of his talent.  \\"The Devils,\\" another brillant film, only came into DVD about three years ago as did, \\"Women in love.\\"  This is a film worth paying the money for.  It is unforgettable.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I had all the ABBA albums (Yes, as in a big black disc) and they were among my favorites. This movie is so fun to see Meryl have such a good time.(And who knew she had such a great singing voice) All of the actors/actresses are well known and who knew that they could sing so well. Most of them anyway..... As much as Pierce Brosnan is so nice to look at and listen to , he really shouldn't sing. Bottom line this is a great musical.
B001CC7PKS|4.0|I liked the movie so I got in blu ray I have a sony bravia 1080p and at times in movie it looks a little like it goes to 480i,but all in all still excellent movie especially to see jennifer garner in hd.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|Oh, what a joy, what a delight. Like hot coco for the soul !  This movie is visually charming , brazenly witty, and an  independent work of cinematic art. Not for all, but cherished by some, it is a small feat to be witnessed by those with imagination longing for the fantastical in succulent servings.
B000FGGE5Y|1.0|I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or that<br />simply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us\\"I was born into a world,you may not understand\\".Truer words were never spoken.<br />The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the \\"weapon\\" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.<br />The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the \\"weapon\\" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't \\"convert\\" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have \\"vampiral anti-genetic blood\\"(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that the<br />writing the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.<br />I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruitiesmake things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.<br />The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.<br />Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.<br />I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.<br />For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m \\"UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet\\" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.<br />Give this one a definite pass.bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.

0312383320|3.0|I'm on the fence with this one. On one hand, I am a loyal reader of the Stephanie Plum series, which I've found to be entertaining and funny. On the other hand, I don't like the total wackiness this book seem to have descended to.    Stephanie Plum books are great because of the character development. We learn new things about people in every book, and they have special issues to handle in each one. Grandma Mazur, Stephanie's mom, dad, sister, brother-in-law, and nieces, and Ranger all are pretty much skipped over in this book. We do get to learn more about Lula and Joe Morelli, but not really anyone else.    The book seemed to want to push its boundaries a little too much. Stephanie spent 90% of the book gallivanting around with Diesel, a hot guy with magical abilities. She spent some time with Lula, mostly eating and dealing with Lula's cold. She had a lot of interaction with monkeys, plus Big Foot, the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, the Fire Farter, and the Jersey Devil all were there.    All we saw of Stephanie's family was during one short family dinner. Ranger only appeared to provide fresh cars for Stephanie and to get her out of jams...like always. No real steaminess involved. I'm a huge Ranger fan, and the more scenes he is in, the better. Stephanie has three hot guys (Joe, Diesel, and Ranger) lusting after her and taking care of her, and she takes them all for granted.    Yes, the book was entertaining, but it lacked the heart and character development that has helped to make the series such a success.
B00000J7SS|4.0|Clearly the work of prescient musical vision, Mile's ventured where no musician ventured before and with more to lose then most. Putting his reputation on the line and venturing out into a landscape of jazz no one had ever quite experienced before, his efforts paid off. Bitches Brew works on two levels.    The first allows you to hear the expanding world of jazz through a historical filter that takes you back about 40 years. Without charts or maps, Miles blazed his path trying to connect his musical world with the broader cultural changes going on around him.  Turbulent political times, expanded consciousness, artistic liberation all bear down on this historical recording. It has vitality, energy, angst and most of all creative vision.    On another level, which is the music simply as a statement of modern jazz, it holds up remarkably well. With musicians like Wayne Shorter, Benny Maupin, Chick Corea, John McLaughlin, and Jack DeJohnette (among many others)it would be hard to dismiss this in any case. Under the guidance of Miles, it seems they were all playing for greatness and the individual expression in their solos fit so well together, that the results are extraordinary by any measure.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|wow, love chris and way to go for trying something new, but EPIC FAIL! this is just so bad it's laughable. it reminds me of Dee Dee Ramone's foray into hip-hop as Dee Dee King. What a joke!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I just enjoyed the movie. The chemistry, the scenery, just the joy of it. It left me feeling good!  Te storyline of one in the future and one in that past gets me and I can't figure how time caught up to them at the mailbox at the end, if one is two years's ahead how would they catch up?

B000059H98|5.0|The 90s were a time for action flicks with leading men who could bench press the collective weight of the cast & crew, the leading ladies had sex appeal that would turn a gay man straight and a straight woman gay, and premises that were so paper thin you almost felt guilty enjoying what you were watching.    So that's why in 1995, when this \\"action flick\\" dared to be different, and cast a little-known actress in the lead role and a gangster rapper wearing a mutant kangaroo suit as support, with a story based off an obscure British comic, audiences turned their backs and ran. Critics hated it, the creators of the comic series hated it, and the director and star hated what the studio did to it,and somehow, the few people who did see it (it grossed $4 million on a $25 million budget), loved it.    The movie is incredibly fast-paced, the visuals are very there, and the story is entertaining at all points. Lori Petty embodies Tank Girl, Naomi Watts shines in a pre-fame role, Malcom McDowell is (as always) the perfect villain, and even Ice-T, in one of his first acting gigs, does pretty well behind Stan Winston's (incredible) make-up.    Even as a \\"comic book movie,\\" which is quickly becoming it's own genre, this stands out as one of the best.

B00005KARJ|5.0|Dumbo is the best Disney Movie besides Sleeping Beauty. Before CGI and constant tip offs to political correctness and the multiculturalist crap Disney has become in the last 20 years there was this, a real and compelling little movie with excellent animation, a beautiful and touching storyline and a short running time that is probably just enough to keep toddlers interested. The pink Elephants on parade sequence highlights masterful animation skills. Everything about this movie is a winner and I  easily think this is about as good as the remastered Sleeping Beauty. What the heck happened to Disney in the last 20 or so years, they used to be great. Do yourself and your kids a favor and buy them this edition of Dumbo so they can see how awesome Disney used to be before computer animation and the diversity bug bit and sickened them from their creativity.
B0016B6ZKG|1.0|Why would such a talented artist need to release such an album where she will act like she is twenty something? Okay, queen is back - but the lyrics made me wish she didn't. I mean, she is almost sixty years old and she doesn't need to sing such crappy reggaetonish tracks. I thought \\"Crayons\\" was full of disco/club hits like \\"I'm a Fire\\" but I got quite disappointed after purchasing this album. I wish she put more tracks like that - which would also glitter her diva persona in a more glimmering style. This is like a \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" album from a 60-year-old diva. Pointless.

0671027573|5.0|I just recently discovered Linda Howard and after the McKenzies - this is a great book. I loved the heroine, spunky, witty, potty mouthed (but not overly so) yet real enough to admit when scared or needing help. The hero - wow. I wouldn't tell my neighbor to lower his shades if he looked like Sam. Even though their attraction ignites pretty quickly, it is not immediately that Jaine looks at him and falls in love. She actually hates him, doesn't think him attractive and is extremely agitated by him. Very often the heroine is all that, yet so insanely attracted from the very 1st look at him...this was a nice reality check.<br />Their dialogue is super explosive and I also like the development of Jaine's friends. I don't need to repeat the story of the book, I think enough reviewers have already done so. But if you like a fun quick read with a very strong alphamale and heroine, a believable contemporary romantic mystery novel and..ahem..some very nice steamy scenes - this is the book for you.

1572816295|5.0|Where can I start? I have been watching this Tarot develope on the artists website for the past few years. Now I hold the finished product in my hand. This is a masterpiece as far as Tarot decks go. It takes the traditonal images to a new and very, very, detailed level that should your tastes favor this interpretation, you will find a new favorite.    In the endless Rider Waite clones that get stamped out each year, Paulina Tarot rises above the heard. I generally prefer a very boldly colored deck for easier interpretation. It is true, the colors are subtle and easy on the eye. Yet, they are no less vivid. I adore the delicate lines and layers of every card. This is not my first deck, and will not be my last. I collect decks, most are locked away as art decks. This one is very useable as well as aesthetically pleasing. Your clients get a visual treat, as well as very accurate advice.     Whimsical, dreamy and nostalgic, I cannot stop singing the praises of this labor of love. I followed Paulina's plight in New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina. Indeed, the frailty of life is reflected in this deck. It will remain near & dear to my heart! If you feel there are too many decks published annually, treat yourself to this one. It is the new pinnacle as far as other Tarots are concerned. Good luck topping this one.
0385340567|4.0|Maybe not the best of the series, but a second rate Reacher is still better than most of the superguy escapism churned out by other popular authors.  I read this stuff because guys like Reacher can do what we mortals cannot--stick it to the baddies.  Another solid entry in an absorbing series with a genuinely tough and tough minded protagonist.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I think this product is great!!! I received it the day after I ordered it, and it is a WORKOUT!. I have lost over 10 lbs using this video and diet in just a few weeks. I would definately recommend. All you need for this video is hand weights. If you are just starting to work out, I would suggest doing the first week with no weights at all. That is what I did and my arms were still sore. Also, I was very sore in my legs the first day. I would suggest starting at the beginners level, and doing the workout with the girl to the right (if you are looking at the screen) She does a modified workout that is easier. Jillian does a great job of keeping you modivated etc. throughout the video. I have not yet moved from the beginners level, but plan to next week.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|What can I say about Wall-E that hasn't already been said? We already know about the lack of dialogue, the amazing visual effects, and the political commentary of a sedentary life of ecological neglect.  I watched it with my wife and my 18-month old toddler.<br /><br />I loved the movie. Loved it.  Loved the old-school shout outs to computer users everywhere, from the Mac boot-up sound of WALL-E to the iPod-esque design of EVE.  Loved the wry comments on the future of civilization: roaches and Twinkies! Loved the very notion that it's possible to get too caught up in one's climb up the career ladder (EVE) or stuck in a rut (WALL-E), and that there are more important things like life and love.  It's a worthy successor to The Incredibles and makes me forgive Pixar for Ratatouille.<br /><br />My wife questioned why there were babies on the spaceship Axiom: If everyone is just staring into screens all the time, when do they ever have time to procreate?  When two humans finally do look away from their screens, they seem genuinely surprised by their attraction to each other.  Which implies they haven't been doing much interaction at all, begging the question: where do the babies come from? Yes, these are the conversations we have in our household.<br /><br />My theory was that the babies were actually cloned.  Keeping the babies fat and happy was a sort of Machiavellian torture by the robots, who needed servants to continue to function and keep the status quo.  If you consider the long-reaching plans of robots that have been doing this for hundreds of years, Wall-E takes on a considerably sinister tone.<br /><br />Or, ya know, maybe it's a cartoon and we shouldn't worry about it.<br /><br />My toddler seemed to get bored about halfway through.  Even the cool special effects could only retain his attention span for so long.<br /><br />It wasn't until the next day, when we were at Home Depot, that we knew he was really paying attention.  There was a washer/dryer combo displayed side-by-side on a sign.  The doors to the appliances looked suspiciously the two eyes of WALL-E.<br /><br />My son pointed and said a new word, \\"roh-BOT!\\"<br /><br />So I'll put him down as enjoying the movie too.e appliances looked suspiciously the two eyes of WALL-E.

0307454894|1.0|After all the hype I had heard about this book and the movie, the actual read was very disappointing.  The writing was flat and 2-dimensional; it failed to involve me.  The characters the same.  They had no depth, no qualities to make me care about them or what happened to them.  The \\"love\\" relationship was worse than superficial; it was manipulative and cold. It was all described in a distant sort of way; nothing was \\"shown.\\"  I never felt I was pulled into a scene, into a character's feelings, or into any of the described emotions.  I couldn't wait to reach the last page and get on to a great book.

This is truly a treasure of a book, with great writing, a style that sweeps you right inside and holds you there, and wonderful, believable characters.  More, it is an unusual combination of tragic events and brutal war experiences together with the sweetness and poignancy of the characters, a light sense of humor, and an uplifting sense of how the goodness in people survives the worst.<br /><br />It was historically educating, too, since I knew nothing of Guernsey or the experience of its inhabitants with the German occupation.  An eye-opening glimpse into a wonderful, delightful location most of us know nothing about.  A complete success.  Read it; you'll love it!

B000VWYJ8G|5.0|I have liked all of the Bourne movies, but I like this the best.    Some complain about the jittery hand-held camera.  But that's what I like about it.  The jumping camera and the extreme closeups lend a documentary, gritty feel that is just right.    Add that to the fact that the whole movie is a violence-marathon AGAINST VIOLENCE, and you get a very unsettling, but very intriguing and thoughtful thriller.    Granted, it is absurdly fast and harsh.  No more love-affairs, no more even like-affairs.    Just survival and racing to figure out what has happened--and then trying to deal with it.    Superb acting, superb editing, superb camera-work, all in service of a tense but edifying moral: violence only breeds violence; true courage means resisting the urge to violence.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I'm glad that I waited for this little film.  The wait is so much worth it.

B001PPLIFU|5.0|Quantum of Solace is an excellent movie.  Daniel Craig, Olga Kurylenko and Judi Dench all are part of a compelling story that started in Casino Royale.  This movie picks up immediately where Royale leaves off.  The story line is tight.  The action is quick and the characters are convincing as \\"damaged goods\\" trying to make their way in a crazy and absorbing world of lies, espionage and terrorism.  Some scenes are particularly touching as they show Bond struggling with grieving while not knowing how to grieve.  He sits in flight to South America, unable to sleep; drinking and drinking. You get the sense that he may not sleep, just simply passes out. Obviously a way of life since the death of Vesper.  But Bond does know vengence and spends his time in Quantum chasing down those responsible for Vesper's death while on the job as 007.  Craig is a great Bond.  Possibly the best.  No dishonor to the venerable Connery, of course.  Never the less, Craig has redefined Bond as a character who rises above the cartoon caricature that Bond had become into one who is complex, compelling and edgy.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|The Sony PS-LX300USB is a great record player for those who don't know where to start on record players, either that or a great replacement for their old players.<br />I had LPs as mainly collectors pieces for years but lost them all due to moving around from Mass to SC back to Mass to SC to FL. Then in August of 2006, I started working at an independent record store in Port Saint Lucie, FL and realized vinyl wasn't dead. In fact, it's making a major resurrection! Then I started playing vinyl at work when I couldn't find the CD counterpart to play and realized how warm and better many of the older albums sounded (I usually looked for first pressings to play as they were better sounding). Also as part of my job, if we got in records and had more than one copy for sale of, we either threw them out or salvaged some (I managed to save a few Genesis, Beatles (the Red and Blue albums) and Styx (Pieces of Eight and Paradise Theatre) LPs from the trash heap).<br />Then I was on a quest to look for a great record player. Crosley record player with CD burner wasn't what I wanted (though it looked great, reviews weren't great and was a no-name brand which meant system would have died in a short space of time) and then when I saw this Sony record  player, I was like HMMM looks good but is it good? I checked reviews here and 4 out of 5 meant very good so I bought one and it works very well and was well worth my money.<br />To make sure it worked and sounded great, I tested the turntable with the 180 Gram reissue of Led Zeppelin's The Song Remains the Same Soundtrack (which I initially bought to sell but I was like keep it and see if it sounds better than the CD) and the sound from this turntable was warm, clean and played all of the notes in right pitch (unlike some turntables where it sounded like Alvin and the Chipmunks pitch) and now am on a quest for more vinyl to play every now and again.<br />What I also like about this system is it comes with a software to digitalize your old vinyl albums to either MP3s for the MP3 players or (in my case) CDs and can take out all of the crackling and feedback noises.<br />This is a great record player for those who want to either rediscover vinyl or convert to digital to preserve classic recordings.<br />RECOMMENDED!ums to either MP3s for the MP3 players or (in my case) CDs and can take out all of the crackling and feedback noises.  This is a great record player for those who want to either rediscover vinyl or convert to digital to preserve classic recordings.  RECOMMENDED!
031237593X|5.0|I'm a big Sharon Penman fan and am so happy I found out about her books through other reviewers on Amazon.com. Though I still need to read her Welsh Trilogy, I have read everything else and think this is her strongest work. I LOVED this book and kept wishing that history had ended differently - with Richard the III killing Henry Tudor at the final battle. Sharon has so much empathy for this character and brings both Richard and Anne vibrantly to life. A lot of historical fiction authors cannot do this.     Ms. Penman's research is meticulous and she writes with such vivid detail that it places the reader right in the battles, bedrooms and castles of the time period. She presents a very compelling argument for what happened to the Princes in the Tower - though I still find it odd that Richard never try to clear up the rumor that he murdered them - unless he either had a hand in it or knew about it before hand.  For fans of historical fiction and serious fiction, this is a must-read book.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Van Halen's third album (their first with a proper title) called Women and Children First was originally released in March of 1980.<br />The album was recorded in two weeks in January of 1980 but the way that lead singer David Lee Roth, guitarist Eddie Van Halen, his drummer brother Alex Van Halen and bass player Michael Anthony played here it doesn't sound it. The album was also produced again by Ted Templeman and also engineered by Donn Landee. The Women and Children First album was the first where the band wrote all of the songs on the album (and had no cover tunes). What was the result of recording and mixing in a two week span and recording all original material, find out like I did when I first got the album for Christmas in 1984 on cassette tape.<br />The opening rocker \\"And the Cradle Will Rock...\\" had a killer keyboard riff which sounds like an electric guitar but was a distorted Wurlitzer piano cranked through a Marshall amp and stack and two killer Eddie Van Halen guitar solos in the middle and guitar effects on the right speakers. David Lee Roth's vocals were killer on this album. \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" is next with Alex's superb drum intro and an awesome song and all I can think about is the claymated hamburger singing this song in Better Off Dead but a killer song nonetheless with stellar bass work from Michael Anthony and more guitar work from Eddie whom just rocks on this entire album. \\"Fools\\" follows and is an awesome track which starts out with just Diamond Dave and Eddie's guitar before going into a full throttle rocker. The first half closing rocker \\"Romeo Delight\\" is a killer and sounds like proto-thrash with its punkish drumming and metal riffs.<br />The second half kicks off with the killer guitar effect fanfare \\"Tora! Tora!\\" before rocking out to the speed metal sounding \\"Loss of Control\\". Next is the bluesy rocker \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" which may have started out as an acoustic piece at first and then rocks out for the rest of the song. Next is the acoustic blues of \\"Could This Be Magic\\" with Eddie doing some killer dobro and the late Nichollette Larson supplying some uncredited backing vocals towards the end of the track alongside Michael Anthony. The closing \\"In a Simple Rhyme\\" starts out as an acoustic piece before it rocks out then slows again then rocks for the solo then slows for the end like in beginning. After the song ends, there is a hidden 30 second instrumental at the end of the album.<br />When Women and Children First was released, it became the band's first album to storm into the US Top 5 and was another Multi-Platinum hit for the band.<br />Highly recommended!oustic blues of \\"Could This Be Magic\\" with Eddie doing some killer dobro and the late Nichollette Larson supplying some uncredited backing vocals towards the end of the track alongside Michael Anthony.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self-titled debut was released in February of 1978.<br />The band consisted of Dutch born brothers Alex and Edward Van Halen on drums and guitar respectively, bass player and harmony singer Michael Anthony and wild-child lead singer David Lee Roth. They formed in Fresno, California in 1974 and gigged around for awhile and then was dicovered by KISS' resident demon Gene Simmons which led to demos then to their record deal with Warner Bros. who hooked the band up with Doobie Bros producer Ted Templeman to record its debut.<br />When released, rock and roll was battling disco for music supremacy. Whilst the Top 40 was ruled by The Bee Gees, Donna Summer and so forth, rock and roll was battling itself as Punk challenged prog, hard rock and metal for supremacy. Then out of nowhere Van Halen burst onto the scene. We open with the classic \\"Runnin' With The Devil\\" which begins with a car horn from Hell which segues into a classic rocker. Then just when you get over that, we go into \\"Eruption\\" which shows Eddie Van Halen was to become the new rock guitar hero. Then we have the definitive cover of The Kinks' classic \\"You Really Got Me\\" which kicked serious arse. Then another classic rock radio staple follows out of \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\" which just rocks. That riff would be sampled by 2 Live Crew years later on their As Nasty as They Wanna Be album on the song called \\"The F**k Shop\\". We close the first half with the excellent \\"I'm the One\\" which is a killer hard rocker.<br />The second half begins with the rock classic \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" which is also another rock staple. The track was sampled on Tone Loc's \\"Wild Thing\\" years later. Next is an underrated classic on the album \\"Atomic Punk\\" which just burns. We rock again with \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\" which was a phenomenal song with killer guitar leads from Eddie and singing and screaming from Diamond Dave. \\"Little Dreamer\\" follows and is a great mid-tempo rocker which is a great song. Next is \\"Ice Cream Man\\" which starts on acoustic before giving way into a hard rock masterpiece. We close things with the heavy metal sounding \\"On Fire\\" with almost punkish playing and Diamond Dave and Michael Anthony screaming like they were possessed by Satan himself.<br />Van Halen's self titled debut reached the US Top 20 and went Platinum in its first year of release eventually selling 10 plus million copies to date here in the US. Sales aside, this is one of the greatest hard rock albums EVER MADE!<br />Recommended!acoustic before giving way into a hard rock masterpiece.

B0017XFBMG|3.0|I've been a fan of The Pogues since \\"Rum, Sodomy and the Lash\\", which I still own on vinyl.  After a first listening of this set I am mildly disappointed.  While the rarities and alternate versions are fine there is a fair amount of filler.    I may change my mind with a second or third listening, but I would recommend this set only for hardcore fans.    If you're new to The Pogues start with their first 5 CDs, preferably the new editions with bonus tracks, then move onto \\"The Snake\\" by Shane MacGowan.  If you need more come back to this set.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Van Halen's fourth album, in as many years, entitled Fair Warning was released in May of 1981.<br />After unleashing THREE Platinum albums in a row, the members of Van Halen (lead singer David Lee Roth, guitarist Eddie Van Halen and his drummer brother Alex and bass player Michael Anthony) were starting to splinter apart in more ways than one. At the time, tensions between Eddie Van Halen and Diamond David Lee Roth had been mounting over various reasons (one of which was Eddie married the Hollywood star (actress Valerie Bertinelli) and Roth was jealous that Eddie got to marry the movie star/Hollywood \\"it\\" girl and he didn't) and Roth believed he was what made VH and Eddie thought he, his brother Alex and Anthony were what made VH so the tensions spawned an album that became Van Halen's darkest to date (and the second album to where the band wrote all of the tracks). Would Fair Warning be a classic or would it be a bust, read ahead and find out (as I did when I first heard this album on cassette when I was 8 in 1984 and subsequently got on CD then remastered CD).<br />We begin with a faded-in guitar doodle which gives way to the great rocker \\"Mean Street\\". This song is a classic rocker and Eddie's soloing here is un-Earthly and would become a rock radio staple. Next is the rocking \\"Dirty movies\\" which featured Eddie playing some tasty slide in addition to some great riffing and Roth's vocal about watching dirty movies was classic, especially the middle section of the track with the band acting out like they saw a stripper. Next is the punk-metal rocker \\"Sinners Swing\\" which was one of the first VH tracks to utter an obscenity and is a superb rocker. The first side ends with the superb \\"Hear About it Later\\" which was another great rocker, the ending solo was killer.<br />The album's second half kicks off with the rock radio smash \\"Unchained\\" which is just a killer song. This rocker just tears up the place. Next is the funk-laced \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" which was as funky as VH got save Eddie's pyrotechnic solo in the middle of the song. Next is the rocker \\"So This is Love\\" which is one of the band's best rockers about, what else, sex and a great rocker. Next was the instrumental \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park\\" which was basically Michael Anthony's bass guitar synthesizer solo mixed with Alex's pounding on the skins like a possessed John Bonham. We end with the punkish \\"One Foot Out the Door\\" which was the second VH track to utter an obscenity but is a great album closer and Eddie's solo just smoked at the end.<br />Fair Warning was another US Top 10 Platinum seller album for the band despite the fact \\"so-called\\" corporate rock bands ruled the music scene by then. Fair Warning still sounds great today, especially with the remastered version which came out in 2000.<br />Recommended!ot save Eddie's pyrotechnic solo in the middle of the song.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|Originally, I bought London Calling for, London Calling. I had heard that it was a great album but when I first listened to it I didn't know what all the hype was about. However, 3 months later I understand. London Calling has the tracks that instantly grab you (London Calling, Train in Vain, Spanish Bombs) and the songs that slowly reveal themselves to be the reason for the high praise (The Card Cheat, Rudy Cant Fail, Jimmy Jazz, Guns of Brixton, Death or Glory ect.). I believe that after Born to Run and The Joshua Tree London Calling is the greatest album ever and after The Rolling Stones and U2 The Clash are one of the greatest bands ever!ever!
0743270754|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br />I probably did not read all the details about it when I ordered it. So I was surprised by it's size.<br />I enjoyed the history lessons it shared. I found myself comparing some of the details of Lincoln's life with my own. There were many times when my thoughts concurred with his (and others).<br />My only problem with the book was there were so many people involved it was hard to keep track of who was who. (but that's probably just me.)<br />All in all, I liked this book very much and would highly recommend it to someone interested in our country's political history, or the civil war, the roots of desegregation and/or President Lincoln, himself.<br />Peace, K :)
0525478183|5.0|I got this book through the amazon Vine program and all I can say is \\"WOW!\\" I really enjoyed this book. I want to go and order all of the other books this author has written and read those too.<br /><br />Q is your typical kind of nerdy, hangs with the band kids, straight A student kind of guy. Things would stay that way for him if it wasn't for his neighbor Margo Roth Spiegelman. She is just cool and awesome in every way. Then she shows up in his bedroom in the middle of the night...dressed as a ninja. She takes him on a tour of the town that will change who he is forever. He is so stoked about spending time with her; then the next morning she is gone. Is she really gone though? She has a history of leaving clues when she leaves home. So Q and his buddies try to unravel the mystery of Margo.<br /><br />This book is so many things at once. It is about the sameness of the world, about what people want, about people who can't fit in to society's rigid structure, about how we label each other, it's a coming of age story, a mystery, and an adventure.<br /><br />I was awed at how I read this book straight through without even realizing I had started reading it. I was amazed at how funny and serious it is; how it made me laugh out loud and cry too. I think there is something for everyone to relate to in this book it doesn't matter your age. We've all been in school, dealt with parents, and friends so we can all relate.<br /><br />Green captures so many things with great insight. The craziness of prom, the sadness and emptiness of those last days of high school, the frustration of people who want something different, and the guilt of people who are happy with being just plain ole vanilla.<br /><br />The above are at the heart of the story, but the plot itself is a well crafted mystery. Full of suspense and an intriguing trail of clues the book was impossible to put down. I read it in 3 hours. I also laughed my head off at Q's crazy friends and felt Q's frustration. The characters in this book were so real. The story itself is an absolute riot to read; it's crazy fun.<br /><br />In a nutshell I loved it. I still cannot believe that a book that touches on such deep issues was so much fun to read. I think everyone should read it. I am keeping it as part of my permanent collection and I hope someday my son will read it and love it too.<br /><br />Did I mention I also want to read all of Green's other books now? I really do.tory itself is an absolute riot to read; it's crazy fun.    In a nutshell I loved it. I still cannot believe that a book that touches on such deep issues was so much fun to read.

B001UOVP1S|4.0|I am not sure what (most) people are talking about.  I think the album is a lot of fun.  Why do people have a problem when artists evolve?  Did anyone have a problem when the Beatles went from Help! to Rubber Soul or from Revolver to Sgt. Pepper?  Who cares if Phil Collins did this in the 80's?  I think it is refreshing.    It reminds me of when Kanye West released 808's and Heartbreak.  It was met with great criticism right away and then after people listened to more than the preview of tracks, they began to love it.  I loved it on the first listen just as I am enjoying Chris Cornell's work right now.    Thanks Chris (and Timbaland) for a good solid album.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|It seems like some people don't like this album because they were expecting something more along the lines of the other bands this artist has been a part of, and this is completely different.    I'm not a fan of the growling, screaming metal.  I just don't think that's music.  But I find this album to be very musical and enjoyable.  Chris Cornell has a very unique voice that's pleasant and smooth and easy to listen to.    This album might not please some of his existing fans, but it can certainly find some new ones.
B000002L99|5.0|It Was 1985 and The Mighty Van Halen had recruited the already successful Sammy Hagar as their lead man.    Dave released his First and only assault at Van Halen \\"Eat Em' and Smile\\" which broke down the doors with the pure hard rock smash of \\"Yankee Rose\\".    Meanwhile, Sammy and The Gang were ready to hit dave back with their first of many assaults at him with the one and only grandiosity of \\"5150\\"    Yes, I've Heard \\"5150\\" and \\"Eat Em' and Smile\\" over and over and over again...but there was always something about \\"5150\\" that made me come back to it a lot more...i think it's just the songs and how fluidly they are produced and just how much it is suppose to be a stab at dave makes it sound even stronger.    Good Enough Rocks Forward and is an in your face all air assault on David Lee Roth.    Why Can't This Be Love is pure Van Hagar, But Still Is Catchy...and holds up today, without sounding dated...    Get Up is another in your face air assault on David Lee Roth...with it's hard pounding metallic shell all around and sounds like Hot For Teacher On Steroids.    Dreams is another Van Hagar sounding track, but very good song none the less...    Summer Nights is a great song    Best Of Both Worlds rocks and is another stab at David Lee Roth    Love Walks In is one of the best ballads i've ever heard, it's amazing without being 80's cheesy...    5150 just rocks    Inside is basically a collection of sounds and laughter basically the guys laughing it off and showing David Lee Roth that they can still have tons fun without him        Now, although Van Halen released 3 more albums with Sammy Hagar...they seem to be a lot more casual rock radio releases and don't pound as hard as this one does...    this is a great follow up to 1984 and basically what makes it so good is that their sound is a lot more mature and although they're still having fun, the songs sound a lot more like songs and not like one big fat joke (Eat Em' and Smile)

B0013FXWU6|5.0|Something about this movie draws me in every time.  I found an amazing amount of analytical philosophy in it.  The beginning of the movie shows a man all alone beaten and battered by his hard work for the Geological Survey, and getting hardly anything in return for it.  After a lot of hard work and perseverance he becomes a successful Oilman prospecting for crude oil, the blood of the Earth, and living the good life of luxury .... but that isn't enough for him.  And if money galore isn't enough for a man then how must he relate with those around him?<br /><br />  A main theme through the movie is how the Oilman and the Pastor in the story get along.  The music during these scenes seems to suggest what I had suspected: Battle of the Shamans.  There's an odd twist to the interrelationship between these two characters.  The Christian Pastor seems like a decent human being who perhaps really is a man of genuine faith, but there's no doubt that, at the same time, he is also a trickster who capitalizes on the gullibility of his churchmembers and his miracles are of course, well, less than miraculous.  Not so with the Oilman, his miracles are quite real and the proof is concretely validated everywhere.  Problem is the Oilman is a divided man as well; there's the sense in the movie that he has a heart and does what he can to prevent injustices and abuse, but at the same time he's extremely anti-social and when his temper flares it flares much, like a Psycho or Friday the 13th movie.  The Oilman is tired of the dishonest people around him, he can't stand the way people constantly lie to get ahead instead of actually doing the gritty hard work, and the next time he meets another liar like that he just might snap ... and does, and then there is blood.<br /><br />  This leaves me fascinated with the story as I love & hate both men at the same time, and can't help but to relate with the both of them as well.  Plus, it is worthy of noting that there is, in my opinion, much more real politics shown in this flick than there is any movie about presidents, congressmen, and senators.  I found it fascinating that Standard Oil's name was dropped in the movie, a slight hint to the Rockefeller's for those who are familiar with that corrupt story.  Geopolitics is a central theme in the movie and it's shown fairly well: Finders keepers & Possession is 9/10ths of the law.  In addition to all this the movie has some very interesting classical music playing throughout, some Arvo Part (nice choice), a Violin Concerto by Brahms (another great pick), etc.  All in all though, not everyone is going to be able to understand, relate with, and like this movie, but I definetely did.  5 Stars.more real politics shown in this flick than there is any movie about presidents, congressmen, and senators.

142312166X|1.0|This was my bigest disappointment since Tales of Beedle Bard by JK Rowling.I was expecting a regular full length book.Was I fooled.I have read the ist 4 with great pleasure.I will be careful trusting Riordan in the future.
031606792X|5.0|Okay so I totally fell in love with the series from the start and was freakishly excited to read the last book.All the reviews for the other books were so good I was like what the heck when I started to read the reviews for this one. I was almost scared to read it cuz i didn't want to mess up my whole opinion of the series but of course I read it anyway. By the end of the book I was like what the heck were those people talking about, I thought it was a very good ending to the saga. I guess I can understand why people didn't like it as much as the others because there was a lot of preparation leading up to the climax but it was ,to me, like that with all the books. I think people responded that way cuz it was the last in a really great series and nobody likes it when a good thing ends, but hay thats the way things go. So go ahead and read the book if your wondering if its worth it. I don't think you will regret it.
0810970686|5.0|My son loves this series and even shares with the rest of us some of the funniest parts.  These books are all very clever and simple.  I wonder why I didn't create something like this myself.  Oh well.  I'm just happy my son has found something he enjoys reading.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|When I first heard Cornell would work with Timbaland, I braced for the worst, especially after hearing the awful work he did with Duran Duran last year.  Usually, I find Timbaland's work too sterile (the beats, while danceable, too perfect to really groove).  And that's somewhat the case here.  I really like a lot of the old style synth sounds that are used, and the textures and deep bass are great, but the whole thing sounds a bit artificial.  It's saved somewhat by Cornell's voice.  Timbaland's usual pop or rap pairings mostly can't sing like this, so Cornell can take the songs up a notch.  And as with Cornell's last solo album, the vocals are sounding much better than in the Audioslave era.  He constructs some pretty memorable melodies.  The thing that's missing vs. his previous solo work, however, are all the open guitar tunings and harmonic color provided from them.  These songs give up so much to the rhythm of the loops that there isn't much room for the more interesting chord changes that characterize Cornell's best stuff.  Some people will reflexively give it 1-star, but it's far better than that.  Nevetheless, it's not as interesting as his first two solo albums, and so we hope its a transition on toward something more expansive.  I admire his guts to try a project like this, but I might have chosen a different (more musically diverse) producer than is Timbaland.  To go in this type of direction, someone like Danger Mouse might have been a hipper choice.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I have 3 versions of Pride & Prejudice movies--the 1979 version shown on PBS, the 1990's BBC version, and this version.  To me, they each have their strong points and I like them all.    The PBS version is much closer to the book than the others and the Bennet sisters are much prettier than in the 2 later movies.  Elizabeth Garvie was an excellent Elizabeth. I thought David Rintoul as Darcy wasn't as good as the later movies--he was too formal and elegant.  That might be closer to how a rich, proud young man might act in that time, though.  I thought the Mr & Mrs Gardiner in the PBS version were by far the best of the 3 movies.  They had more class.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet seemed to be characterized as they are in the book, as did the other characters.  I thought this movie had the best Mr. Collins and the best Mr. Bingley.  I also preferred this version's Lady Catherine and Anne de Bourgh.    The BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle was pretty good and followed the book reasonably well.  Firth's Mr. Darcy seemed more human and more masculine.  I thought Mr. Bennet was pretty good, but Mrs. Bennet was far too cartoonish to be anything but annoying.  Kitty and Lydia argued too much for supposedly being close.  None of the Bennet girls were pretty enough and looked a little too chunky, although that may have been the clothes.  I thought they might have tried to cast Jane Bennet as looking like Jane Austen, but she just looked a little odd--not beautiful.  Mr. Bingley looked a little goofy.  The Gardiners were okay, but Mrs. Gardiner made a couple of remarks about the Darcy family that sounded resentful and/or envious and I do not think that Jane Austen's Mrs. Gardiner would have been either resentful or envious.  The music was a little better in this movie than in the PBS version and the dances lasted longer.  I thought the Mr. Wickham in this movie was the best one.    This newer version with Keira Knightley had by far the best music and the best dancing.  I liked this Mr. Darcy well enough, too, but Mr. Bingley was even goofier looking than the one in the BBC version, although I thought Miss Bingley was good--more elegant.  This version did not follow the book all that much--certainly not as closely as the earlier 2 versions.  The Bennet family and the Gardiner family were portrayed as much lower class and poor than I think Jane Austen had any idea of them being.  I did like the softened characters.  For example, Mrs. Bennet wasn't quite so loud and certainly not as cartoonish as the one in the BBC version.  This wasn't really true to the book, but one got the feeling that this Mr. and Mrs. Bennet did love each other.  Other reviewers have mentioned the ridiculousness of the ball scene where everyone stops dancing and makes a path for Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Miss Bingley.  I didn't like that either.  Nor did I think that Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner would have gone off and left Lizzy at Pemberley so that she had to walk back to the inn in Lampton.  I didn't like the statue room scene or Lizzy wandering around the house by herself.  However, although this film wasn't nearly close enough to the book, I did love the music and I thought it more romantic in some ways.  There were some parts that were a little weird such as Lizzy staring into a mirror for hours while it went from daylight to dark, and Mr. Darcy letting himself into the Collins' home at night to give her the letter.  And, of course, Lady Catherine's late night visit to the Bennet's home.    The PBS version is around 4 hours and the BBC version is around 5 1/2 hours, while this version is a little over 2 hours.  I highly recommend having all three, just to enjoy the different interpretations and portrayals.  Otherwise, rent them first and see which you like best.  The PBS version, I feel, is defintely closer to the book.  The other two have far better Mr. Darcys.  As I said earlier, there is something to enjoy in each version.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|This movie had me on the edge of my seat through its entirety. The story was very engaging and engrossing. I can't really go into it without spoiling anything, so its just going to be left at that.   If you have read many spy novels, (such as W.E.B. Griffin or Tom Clancy, etc.) and/or have an ear for the lingo, you will catch a bunch of those little subtlety's in this film.    And on top of everything else, the movie is sight to behold. The cinematography(?) is excellent!
B001IARDJ2|4.0|So many reviews have already been written about this book that I couldn't possibly add much more.  I did enjoy the book and found myself laughing and smiling more than once.  I felt so bad for poor Becky at times but also cringed at her apparent density.  I like that by the end of the novel, she grew as a character and realized that she needed to be an adult.  I liked her much more by the end than I did at the beginning.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|This is not anything like what CC has done in the past. If you are expecting to hear grunge or rock of any sort, this album is not for you. It is pop. It was meant to be pop. CC shows his versatility as a singer in this album yet again. How many singers do you know that can jump genres like this? He is very gifted, and very smart. He just doubled his fan-base with one album. And it's not the first time he's swayed away from rock. Remember the operatic 'Ave Maria', or the poppy 'Wave Goodbye', or the blusey 'When I'm Down' and 'Call Me a Dog'. If you haven't seen this coming...you're blind. CC has something for everyone! And unless you're a hard-core CC fan, or you have an appreciation for all types of music, you aren't going to like everything he puts out. Bottom line...great voice!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|The first time I heard Chris Cornell, was when he was in a band called Soundgarden (Black Hole Sun is arguably one of the best songs ever written and sung). I must admit I lost complete contact with Chris's music until I heard his new song called Ground Zero.  I was completely mesmerized by the sound of his voice, and to be honest, I really had no idea that the man behind Black Hole Sun, was the same man behind Ground Zero.  I downloaded Ground Zero, and patiently waited for the Scream album to be released because my gut instinct told me that the album would be great.   I've read so many reviews of fans being disappointed with the Scream album because it's a huge departure from what they're all used to listening to where Chris Cornell is concerned.    Well, in my humble opinion, love it or hate it, Chris took a chance, ventured into new territory, and I feel, it payed off beautifully.  There's certainly no denying that incredibly beautiful and at times, haunting voice. For those of you who think that Timbaland is a hack, well, he's still in the music business, he's incredibly successful, he's constantly sought after and well respected, so if you don't care for his brand of music, then don't buy it and don't listen to it.    Two very gifted and talented people got together and created something wonderful, so either deal with it or move on because they're not going anywhere, and I wish Chris and Timbaland much success, because they so richly deserve it...
B00005JKED|5.0|What is wrong with him?  From the time he hung up on Hoyt to the time Hoyt shot him in the right and or left butt cheek, something was wrong with denzel in this movie.  5 stars because it had everything! Great Plot, Snoop dog and Dre!  I think I seen Suge Knight somewhere in the background.  Yes in the cut scenes he is hollaring at Olivia O Lovely, if you don't believe me, check youtube. Pornstars and Deathrow, how could you go wrong?  The only thing I have to complain about is that the movie can't be watched more than one time, not that this is a bad thing but the movie is so in your face that it loses the effect the 2nd time.
B000YABYLA|1.0|i wanted to like this movie after all they hype that had been showered upon it. i became a michael cera fan after arrested development. ellen page is a great actress, too, and is amazing in a lesser known film called hard candy. juno however sucked the life out of me with all its \\"cool\\" dialogue. i'm sorry but even the coolest of cool high school girls can't pull off that level of omniscience. this pedantic jv chic was shoving all this coolness down my throat and it was just too big of a pretentious pill to swallow. this movie was far from honest. the script tried way too hard to have the characters say just the right thing while dripping with just the right amount of sarcasm. this diablo cody chic probably stayed up many late nights over her typewriter trying to find the perfect quip or insult for her title character to mutter. it was just awful and painful to watch. hey diablo...if you want to learn how teenagers talk take a tip from john hughes!
B001UOVP1S|2.0|I really wanted to like Chris Cornell's new album, but it was very hard to give a listen.  Most of it sounds similar to many other cookie cutter pop albums that are heavy on the synth.  I still have a hard time believing that this Grunge God put out an album that at times does not even match his voice.  It is also very light on the guitar.  If you take the picture of the album and then listen to it; it makes sense... he must have literally broke his guitar.  After Chris's release of You Know My Name for Casino Royale, I figured this album would be the same type of music; boy, was I wrong.  Some of the tracks are so generic that I snicker at the thought of Cornell performing these songs live with Backstreet Boy choreography.      What is Timbaland talking about (I must be listening to the wrong album)?  ---> Timbaland has referred to the recording sessions as \\"The best work I've done in my career,\\" and predicted that Cornell will be the \\"first rock star in the club\\". Cornell called the new album \\"a highlight of my career.\\"  .... WTH????      The lyrics are void of any true deep meaning.... not at all like the Cornell I remember.  There are a few parts with some decent sitar sounds, but other than that, don't waste your money.
B000063DFN|5.0|Not only is this my favorite Maiden album, this is my favorite album of any album... and I listen to all kinds of music. I have not stopped rocking this since I first got my hands on it back in 1986 (yeah, I was 2 years behind, but caught up real quick). This album overall yielded the best songs, production, and world tour <LIVE AFTER DEATH>. Is it any surprise that they brought back the Egyptian theme for their \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\" world tour '08-'09? I didn't see any devils with pitchforks or guys in straightjackets running around on stage. \\"The Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Piece of Mind\\" are awesome albums, but POWERSLAVE RULES!
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Stephen Daldry is a director who has started to acquire a reputation for tackling books that are rather difficult to adapt, starting with his 2002 debut, \\"The Hours\\".  This time, he has chosen as his subject Bernhard Schlink's 1995 novel 'Der  Vorleser', which was somewhat controversial at the time, attracting accusations of creating too much reader sympathy for a former SS officer.  I did not find that to be the case here; what Schlink and Daldry are doing, as I see it, is raising uncomfortable questions and taking the stance that there are no neat answers (which could, I suppose, be called a dodge, or else dramatically unsatisfying).  Some spoilers follow.    The film, like \\"The Hours\\", has a somewhat intricate narrative structure, juggling timelines in 1958, 1966, spans from the 1970s to the 1980s, and 1995.  There are points when this seems unnecessarily complicated, but it generally works well.  The most effective sequences are the 1958-1966 span, where Michael Berg (David Kross) finds himself drawn into an affair with Hanna Schmidt (Kate Winslet), a Neustadt tram employee.  He is 15, she considerably older.  Their relationship is almost a quid pro quo of sex and reading.  Then, one day, she vanishes, only to return into his life surprisingly in 1966, when he finds her on trial for her role in the death of 300 Jewish women in the final days of World War II.  In the later sequences, an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes, a long way from Amon Goethe) as he deals with the aftermath of these events.    One of the more prurient items of discussion regarding this film is that it features quite a bit of Kate Winslet naked and having sex (though 1 in every 2 Kate Winslet movies might be said to have the same).  There is also plenty from the young Kross (one imagines your average young actor would be thrilled for their first role to involve a lot of time being naked in bed with Kate Winslet).  There is in our society something of a double-standard regarding such underage relationships; if this film starred Brad Pitt and Emma Watson, once imagines the reaction of critics and audiences would be rather different.  However, \\"The Reader\\" conveys with great subtlety the damage this does to Michael (even before the Nazi revelation).  In 1958, while the affair goes on, Michael becomes isolated from his friends and ignores the more age-appropriate Sophie; by 1966, at law school, he finds himself incapable of sleeping in the same bed as a fellow law student; in the present day, we find him divorced and struggling to connect with his daughter.    On the issue of the Holocaust, the filmmakers are quite aware of the risk they run in focussing so much on Hanna; the camera tends to create sympathy, particularly as she is so scared an uncomprehending when brought to trial.  We feel the temptation to make excuses for her based on illiteracy.  And, at the end, the film wheels out a survivor (Lena Olin, wonderful in two scenes) to challenge this directly.  Michael, whose story this is and whose views have been transplanted to the audience to an extent, squirms under her questions.  As Olin says, the film cannot offer absolution, nor, perhaps, should it (that's up to you, of course).    Berg's guilt comes not just from his inability to resolve the question of Hanna, but also from his own actions in 1966, and what that says about him.  On  a much smaller scale, he repeats the moral cowardice of Hanna's generaton which casts doubt on whether he'd have done any better in her situation.    The cast is excellent.  Winslet deserved an Oscar for the work she does here (though it's more properly a supporting role, not a lead); what she does with her facial expressions in the trial scene is impressive.  Kross makes a strong impression here as well.  There's novelty in the presence of actors from past Holocaust dramas occupying roles much more sympathetic; not just Spielberg's Amon Goethe, but Hitler himself, Bruno Ganz (\\"Downfall\\", another film that attracted criticism of too much sympathy for the devil), as a law professor.  Overall, a very strong package.    And for those who don't get the title reference, do consider watching the BBC comedy series \\"Extras\\".
0810970686|5.0|If you have ever struggled with that child that refuses to read, who would rather sit in front of the tv than read a book, buy this book.<br /><br />When kids are pre-teens they are very much in between. Most books are either too old, or too young for them. Most shows are either too old, or too young for them. This is a book that they can identify with. It may even inspire them to keep a journal.<br /><br />Once you get them to start reading the series, they will be clammoring for more. Its a funny book, that can easily be read by middle schoolers, or even advanced elementary students.<br /><br />I would have to say that this one had been the most well written of the series. It is quite funny at times, it seems as though the author has really found his voice and confidence in his work.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I never heard about this series until my English Professor presented it to us, for use on our term paper report. He showed us episode 12 of the 1st season and I enjoyed it so much that I purchased both seasons 1 and 2. I must say I have enjoyed the series and can not wait til season 3 comes out. I am seriously hooked on this series. Hey, if you can sit and watch those SAW movies then I definetely recommend you watch this series. The characters are Great!  The series does contain very strong, \\"foul\\" language and has quite a bit of \\"EXPLICIT\\" sex scenes.   I STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU ARE 18 OR OLDER!     You will find yourself pulling for DEXTER...  Enjoy!!!
B001TH16DI|4.0|I personally didn't like the Director's Cuts of the films. I think it took away from the original cut completely.<br /><br />I didn't like that the tone was different in McCoy's voice when he was explaining the glasses to Kirk in ST2. \\"They're for your eyes!\\" Really? No way, and Kirk wouldn't know this why? As we've seen in other Star Trek series people do wear glasses sometimes even in the 24th century. This was not in the theatrical cut.<br /><br />I didn't like when Valeris was explaining who was in the plot to destroy the peace process and they did all the flashes of the people's faces because evidently Nick Meyer doesn't believe that anyone could understand what Valeris was saying. This was not in the Theatrical Cut, it was more dramatic with the camera continuously circling and no breaks in the scene when Valeris and Spock say each persons name.<br /><br />I think that all the new special effects did not fit in TMP. And why would you cut the \\"Get out of here, Bones\\" scene at all? Bring on the Blu-Ray releases so I can sell the crappy Director's Cuts.<br /><br />I'm sure I'm a minority here but I guess I just didn't like the Director's Cuts at all. I gave it 4 stars because they didn't clean up all of the films.
B001PPLIEQ|1.0|I'm sorry to say in my opinion that this may be the most disappointing entry in the entire Bond series. I chalk this up primarily to terrible direction and an incoherent script that fails to pull charactors and situations together in to anything resembling a story. First the direction, the way that the camera jump cuts every two seconds during action scenes like a hyper kinetic six year old on Mountain Dew makes it all but impossible to follow. This goes on for several minutes at a time, at the end of which, who knows what happened. I know I couldn't follow it. The story itself lacks cohesion through out. Who/What/When/Where/Why - all missing. The action is frantic, if you are able to follow it and make any sense out of it, you're ahead of the curve. Daniel Craig plays the role well, though he is saddled with a terrible script that would limit anyone. Based on his first two outtings, I have craig as my fourth favorite Bond behind Connery, Brosnan and Dalton. The villan in this movie is well acted, but again, poorly written. As a result, net grade for the villan D-. None the less, I will be buying the DVD as soon as it comes out as I am a life long movie collector and have every Bond movie ever made on both VHS and DVD. If you aren't a collector however, I would pass on this one, it has a Licesne to Confuse and Bore. Sorry Mr. Bond. I give this movie 1 star. If it wasn't a Bond movie I might give it 2 stars, but I expect more from the Bond series than this and hold it to a slightly higher standard than I do other films.
0307269752|2.0|This book came highly recommended which is perhaps part of the reason I was disappointed, but only part. I have four major issues with the book. First, all of the first 25% of the book and sections of the remainder of the book are conversations between characters to bring you up to date on what's transpired in the past-- no action. Second, there are very few twists and surprises in the book. Third, the author continually refers to products by brand name and writes as if he were trying to show his technological brilliance which creates passages that don't move the plot forward. Finally, and most importantly, I personally didn't like the subject matter-- I won't go into detail to avoid spoilers, but there were two different plot lines that didn't even intertwine.  On the plus side, I liked the two main characters who were well drawn and certainly not run of the mill. I am truly surprised by the outstanding reviews the book has received.
0316172324|4.0|I found this book quite fascinating.  It confirms what I've always believed: go with your gut and don't waiver.  I could barely blink while reading.  It was that compelling.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|\\"Why can't you build a school thats not 1/4 of the size? \\" or something like that , is one of my favorite scenes, when a model replica of a school is shown. this movie is laugh out loud funny and very stupid funny.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Andy Tennant has done a marvelous job in creating a very moving strong storyline about Cinderella.  Drew Barrymore has put in her best performance.  The well written script and superb cast ensure this movie's place as one of the best romantic stories in many years.  You will not be disappointed.  Enjoy!
B001UOVP1S|1.0|Horrible.  If you were looking forward to Chris Cornell's new CD as much as I was, then you are going to be disappointed.  Gone is the passion.  Avoid this at all costs.  (Even spending a measly $2.99 is a waste.) My only question for CC is...What happened?
B001P5HI4A|5.0|Finally this beautiful movie reaches DVD.  The production values, camera and lighting are excellent.  Streisand directed this Academy Award winner with such vision and style that it is hard to believe it was her first film at the helm. The supporting cast is wonderful.  Mandy Patinkin has never been better.  Amy Irving deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance as Barbra Streisand's wife.  This is a rich look at a world long ago when women were not allowed the same schooling as men.    The extra's include a feature commentary by Streisand and tons of rehearsal material and some deleted scenes.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Taut performances, great writing and direction make this film almost an epic...it runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.  But there is not one false note along the way.<br /><br />I was not familiar with Jolie's work as an actress, but because this year's Oscar race in the Best Actress category was the best in years, I had to see this film.  I love films based on true stories anyhow, but that's besides the point.<br /><br />Jolie is outstanding as is Malkovich and the rest of the supporting cast!!  Her performance was truly worthy of the Oscar nomination she received.<br /><br />True, the graphic portrayal of the \\"child abuse\\" scenes were a bit much to take and I had to turn my head away at some points.....(this is what gives the film the \\"R\\" rating it received).<br /><br />But for the most part the film is gripping and you can't take your eyes off the screen as you wait in breathless anticipation for what happens next.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I've been a huge Chris Cornell fan for many years.  I've never been much of a hip hop fan, never even heard of Timbaland before this!  I don't know why Chris's hard rock fans keep trying to put him into that box; I LOVE the hard rock Chris, too, but as a true artist, he is going to experiment with different sounds and genres.  I think he pulls this off very well; we still get his beautiful, powerful voice and haunting lyrics, so what's not to like?  If you're a TRUE Cornell fan, give it a chance; you might love it.
6305127638|2.0|CONS:  Modern Hollywood action film, if you've seen Eagle Eye, you've seen this. Warp speed plot. Fast dialogue of things we haven't been made aware of yet, the techno babble about \\"First Contact.\\"      Fans of the original series, it's mostly an popcorn action film and I would not recommend this for you....      PROS:  There are many well played intense actions scenes between Picard and the Borg (his arch nemesis).    On the DVD edition, Jonathan Franks is (as always) very funny, self-aware and introspective, a fan's best friend, he provides a very interesting commentary.
B001HN697C|5.0|This was a good prequel, but it wasn't a great one.  There should've been more info on the love affair between Lucian and Sonja...but there wasn't.  Sonja's character should've been developed more...but it wasn't.  Lastly, they killed her too quickly.  Her death should've been more tragic than it was...but it wasn't.  Still in all, I liked the movie and would recommend it to any fan of the Underworld franchise.
6304711905|4.0|A truly great film, is any of it factual? I actually saw it in the 90's and it was as good as it was then, well shot and well casted, I loved it, as good as any other classic Western.
1881273156|5.0|This is a practical book for improving one's marriage. It points out that different things are more meaningful than others when it comes to expressing love. Loving acts can fall into the following five basic categories: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, gifts, physical touch. Once you determine what your mate's primary love language is, you can work at keeping them feeling loved more effectively. It's also good to determine your own primary love language and let your mate know. Several things I plan to implement after reading this book are:<br /><br />(1) Focus on encouraging, complimenting and using kinds words every day when speaking to my husband.<br />(2) Have a sharing time each day where we each share three things that happened to us that day and how we feel about them.<br />(3) Make a list of things we want to do together and do at least two per month.<br />(4) Plan a new event with strong memory potential and do it this year.<br />(5) Play \\"fill your tank\\" game. Ask spouse three times a week how full his love tank is on range of 0-10 and ask what I can do to fill it up today.
B000NIWI9K|5.0|I bought this DVD several weeks ago and can't get enough of it.  This production is beautifully staged and directed.  It was recorded in HD, the audio is terrific, the singing and acting are wonderful and genuine.  I think this is the type of performance Mozart had in mind when composing this gorgeous opera.    My personal favorite arias are Ferrando's and the Guglielmo and Dorabella duet.  They both bring me to tears.    This will become your favorite Cosi.
B0007939NO|2.0|Lerner and Lowe, Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Vincent Minelli. Sounds like a formula for a masterpiece, right? Think again. The Lerner and Lowe score has only two memorable songs - \\"Heather on the hill\\" and the misplaced \\"Almost like being in love\\" (misplaced because it seems to have been shoved into this film and doesn't fit the rest of the score either musically or thematically). Gene Kelly's choreography is uninspired here. Some of his dance routines in this film are stolen - move for move - from previous films. Worse, they aren't very good. Cyd Charisse has little to do here except look pretty. Vincent Minelli directs poorly. The film looks stagy. Moving track shots are badly done. We can actually see the film shudder a bit before the camera begins to move. The big crowd dance scenes are awful. This is a third rate MGM musical.
0316017922|5.0|We have often heard of \\"work smart instead of work hard\\". The ten thousand hours rule have completely corrected that myth in general.    When opportunity comes, you will be in a good position to receive it if you are ready (means you have accumulated ten thousand hours). The people with eight thousand hours are not ready and the people with six thousand hours probably won't even have a clue that it is coming.
B001KVAMM4|4.0|These Mendelssohn pieces are major works that Mutter clearly masters and presents in interesting ways. The Violin Concerto, for instance, she takes at quite a fast pace, but still holds its shape. In partnership with Lynn Harrell and Andre Previn, she does a lovely job with the Trio No. 1.    A point of concern is Mutter's overwhelming vibrato and excessive \\"expression.\\" To my ear, she now makes a similar over-done tone that Perlman came to rely on in his fifties. Anyone else out there hearing this?  This edition contains both a cd and a dvd. The dvd seems to have a very slight synchonization problem that I found disconcerting. As a violinist, I am interested in seeing how Mutter bows, but couldn't quite do it with this technical glitch.   My last quibble is the package, which is all pink and mauve and flower petals. Blame it on the marketing department, not Mutter, but it doesn't square with the artistic strength either of Mendelssohn or of these players.
B00076POJY|4.0|This laser disc was as described by the seller and plays flawlessly after a cleaning.  A good story, appeal to young and old however, sadly,  some sceens have bin cut from original,  good animations

B001UOVP1S|1.0|What a waste of a great singer.  Is he joking?  The only track worth anything is \\"Two Drink Minimum\\"-that is the Chris I have known and loved.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Illustrator David Drayton (Thomas Jane) is just working at home during a terrifying thunderstorm  that ends partially destroying his house. For the need to fix the damages he goes next morning to a local supermarket in the company of his son and a neighbor that also faces  same problems. On the way David notices two things; the heavy presence of the army and a strange \\"mist\\" coming from the Lake area which eventually hits some citizens that were shopping in the supermarket.    From the point on the movie builds up making the market a stage for  a \\"horror circus\\" coming from creatures outside and a  real terrible monster that stars growing inside the market thanks to Marcia Gay Harden's performance (you will love to hate her) and also I should mention the good supporting cast with Toby Jones (Infamous) that always deserves credit. Another winner here is the surprising end that  make this flick kind of unique in my opinion.    The special effects here only work thanks the B&W version of this movie that is far superior than the color one. The horror works much better in B&W which also makes this film a plus. Is old fashion that works wonders in here see for yourself and compare both versions. The double disc is packed with goodies from director's commentary thru making off - specially scene 35 which is probably the best. So call your friends order some pizza take off the colors from the TV in case you don't have the 2 discs version or if you do... don't think twice put the B&W version first... you won't regret !!!!! Have fun !
031606792X|4.0|I've read all the books in the series - multiple times.  They grabbed me emotionally and I couldn't put them down.  The one thing that was missing for me was Edward's story.   In all the books, I kept wondering what was Edward thinking.  How did he feel when he had to clean the poison out of Bella's blood in Twilight?   How agonized and tormented was he when he left Bella in New Moon?  What did he really feel when he learned Bella was pregnant in Breaking Dawn?  Jacob was given a voice in Breaking Dawn and I think Edward deserved to heard as well.  Don't get me wrong..these are still one of my favorite series of books that will always be part of my library!   I just think hearing Edwards point of view would have made the story so much more romantic and emotional for the reader!
0930289234|5.0|Absolutely a great book. If you are looking for your standard capes and cowls fare, this might not be the book for you. This has complex character development, mystery, and a generally completely different take on the superhero idea. This is the first comic I've read, and will likely get me reading more.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|I new what I was getting into beforehand but Ive always been a huge Chris Cornell fan so I'm along for the ride.<br /> I ordered the album from Amazon but since the download has an exclusive track and it was only $2.99 on release day I went ahead and downloaded it too.<br /> It took about 5 songs into the first listen and then I was with it. Obviously it is different from everything he has done in the past but it is a solid release and works good as an experiment. That is not to say that his next release should be this way, as a one time thing I like it but the next album needs to bring back the guitars.
B001NFNFNA|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  Outstanding acting and directing.  A must see movie.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Blu Ray version of The Dark Knight is a must have.  My friend has the DVD version and when he watches it on his HDTV, hands down the Blu Ray version blows it away.  Of course you'll need the blu ray player.  I have a PS3.  Thanks Amazon.
B001UOVP1S|1.0|It's a sad day when something this mind-numbingly bad comes from Chris Cornell. I can understand Timbaland destroying a once great rock icon, but that icon destroying himself with songs devoid of any of his past emotion is beyond even my comprehension.     This album marks the end of an era.    Rock truly is dying.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Could NEVER say anything bad about Josh. This CD is great as expected. I don't think he would settle for less than 100%
B001GJOL22|5.0|This is an amazing production. And like you've never seen before, Rush plays their glutes off! This music is tighter and more authoritative than Rush has been in more than a decade. If you're in doubt, listen to Digital Man and Natural Science. Or Malignant Narcissism! I'm convinced Getty, Alex and Neal will play better from their graves than most rockers will in their prime. Everyone involved brought their A-game. Unlike many live discs from veteran bands, this is NOT some second-rate, quick-buck attempt to fund retirement. This new production is obviously the result of hard work, dedication and artistry! The sound, camera work, editing, musicianship, and concert production is top notch. Thanks Rush!    If you're a long-time fan, you will LOVE this! The blu-ray is incredible.    My only wish is that the blu-ray package would have included a digital version for playback in iTunes--like the Dark Knight offered. In Utopia, everyone gets an .mp4!

0380725398|3.0|I have read this book several times and always enjoy it, but it's got issues, the main one being that it's utter nonsense from beginning to end. Gothic novels are not supposed to dwell in the pragmatic, but in this case, every decision the heroine makes is ludicrous, and yet we're supposed to believe she's intelligent. I can't explain her worst decision without giving away the ending, which I don't want to do. Excessive, repetitive description of the weather and the landscape will frustrate many readers. Still, I always get sucked in by the romantic atmosphere and the heroine's determination to bring her murderous uncle and his cohorts to justice. Rebecca is a much better Daphne du Maurier novel.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy in Blu-ray was my Valentine gift to my husband. I couldn't have pleased him more. The picture quality is beyond great. We live in a small town and don't always have immediate local access to items such as this. It's great to be able to order online from Amazon and to receive my order so promptly.
B00197POXG|5.0|Arrived in half the stated time. Impressed with the prompt shipping to my remote location here in Australia.
B001FBSMF8|5.0|Once I heard about this album I said to myself I will keep an open mind and I'm glad I did.  He wrote all the lyrics as usual which I liked.  For a rock guy to pull off a pop style album is a big risk, but he did it very well. Overall I like this album more than his last release. To all the 1 stars: People change, including us as fans. Tons of artists change their style over time and we can't expect them to stay exactly the way we want them.  Keep an open mind and try to enjoy it
1594481717|5.0|A great book that affirms using the \\"whole brain\\" as necessary for success in this new, globalized world.    I have used this book in a class I teach for \\"undecided\\" students at a university. Some of the main topics of self-exploration in the class include personality, interests, values and skills. I have had students practice some of the right-brained skills such as empathy and story. For empathy students tried to put themselves in a classmate's shoes and guess their favorite type of music and other personal characteristics without ever having talked to the person before. For story, students wrote a six word autobiography. Although they balked at the notion at first, their stories turned out to be excellent and useful in later conversations relating to choosing a major or career.     Also a fun read with lots of suggestions for professional development related to the six senses: Design, Story, Symphony, Empathy, Play and Meaning.

B001AX9DT0|5.0|March 2009  Wow, what a surprise to hear this man sing last weekend on Saturday Night  Live!  I was sort of listening from the next room where the TV sound was  coming from and one chorus later I was watching the performance wide eyed  because I've heard soulful white guys sing before but Ray's Otis Redding  like voice sent shivers up my spine.  Could it be Otis has been reincarnated as a white guy   with a beard who looks more like he plays in  Phish than a 1960's Memphis Band featuring the King of Soul!  Wow, I've  heard from Cannan and I want to go back for more.  I'm ordering all of  Ray's CDs from Amazon (used) and looking forward to their arrival!  Thank you Ray for your soulful voice and songwriting talent!!!                                   Drummin' Dave In Santa Cruz, CA
B001ECQ75A|5.0|More than a remake, this DreamWorks animated movie is an evident ripoff of the late Chris Farley's 1997 comedy; the more so because no one admits it is!. Pillage includes the movie's premise (Big Fat Klutz rises from Class Embarrassment to to Top Martial Arts Master), several key scenes, the theme song (you guessed it -\\"Kung Fu Fighting\\"), and entire lines, starting with Farley's classic \\"That's AWWWWESOME!!!\\", looted as the panda's mantra.<br /><br />Having said that, Kung Fu Panda is by far a much better film. In fact, it's a great film; the kind of film I wish I'd seen when I was a boy. Back then, us chubby kids were not the rule but the exception, and it seemed our only reason in life was to bear with a grin countless fat jokes and ridicule from peers and teachers (if you think Kubrick dreamt up all the abuse you hear in Full Metal Jacket, you weren't born before 1980). A fat kid was not only considered glutton but stupid, since you couldn't do whatever it was the other kids did. You either found yourself something to be good at, or you cried yourself to sleep. Fortunately for me, I found drawing, and upon it I developed my professional success. Unfortunately for me, I also developed diabetes.<br /><br />Today, obese kids are not the class fatsos but a global pandemia. Kung Fu Panda shows these kids they may not be the ideal, but they're certainly no damaged goods; in fact, they can excel to whatever their will takes them if they learn discipline, sacrifice, compassion, patience, toil and respect. Not a bad message to get across, specially when most \\"cool\\"movies only promote sex, guns and foul language.<br /><br />Plus, the movie itself is a marvel to look at. Not only its animation, which is superb, but the artistic concept behind it, for one not only sees funny characters kicking butt, one sees them as part of entire Chinese watercolors come to life in a universe where every background has a life of its own, and no detail is overlooked. I haven't seen an animated film of such graphic beauty since 101 Dalmatians, nearly fifty years ago.beauty since 101 Dalmatians, nearly fifty years ago.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|Simply, this is a collection of all of ABBA's original albums. If you have the \\"Gold\\" collection or the \\"Definitive\\" Collection, you are going to have a few repeats. This is a great collection of ABBA music. The discs are in sleeves that look like the original album jackets which is pretty cute. The box the CDs come in isn't the same size as a standard jewel case so it probably won't fit in easily or uniformly with the rest of your collection.    But whatever. That's the packaging. As for the music, it is great. In fact, after having heard some ABBA songs I'd never heard (they were a little before my time in their original run), I am thinking that whoever put together the Definitive and Gold collections was asleep at the wheel. There are some really catchy songs that don't get much play or recognition. I love \\"Nina, Pretty Ballerina,\\" \\"King Kong Song,\\" \\"Me and Bobby and Bobby's Brother,\\" and \\"Happy Hawaii.\\" They all have really catchy melodies and are a great change from some of the overplayed standards.    I got this as a Lightening Deal and so got it for a lot less than list price. I am thrilled with my purchase. My coworkers, who've had to sit through hours of ABBA might not be quite as thrilled as I am though!
B001KP2Y3K|4.0|First impressions;  Here is a laid back affair with some rich music textures, and plenty of trademark Madeleine sultry phrasing throughout, but I find it's just a little sedate and lacking a sense of fun.  The tempo picks up on 'You Can't Do Me', but keeps the more serious tone with somewhat fun lyrics.  Over all I found the album enjoyable, but it did not grab me right away, maybe it'll be one of those albums that grows on me and then never lets go.  The songs all seem very well crafted, but I feel they would be much more impressive intermixed with some Madeleine interpreted classics.  Since I lean towards blues, folk and roots, the regular jazz listeners may have a different take.  The musicians do lay down some really nice landscapes.    If you loved her previous albums then you're almost certainly going to be picking this one up.  Amazon's initial price is stellar, but I had to buy it elsewhere to get it a few days early.     I really hope this is an album Madeleine wanted to make and wasn't more or less talked into it.  I'd like to really kick in the a$$ those who complained about her previous interpretations as not original enough or her sounding too much like this person or that person.  To say I really enjoyed her previous albums would be a big understatement.  I'm so glad she's keeping the music alive and doing it with a sense of fun and heart that's very rare.
B0000263JN|4.0|Finding the right words to describe something like *this* is going to be hard.  Alright, supposedly this is the ultimate hippie album, but to me it's just a collection of strangely put together folk rock tunes with a bit of a trickery to the lyrics.  In another way it's almost like childrens music.      For some reason I love it despite sounding rather... well, not exactly dull, but pleasantly mediocre.  The male lead singer of the band has a voice that can reach a range so LOW at times it's almost as if he could dig up dirt with that voice box of his.   Other times he just doesn't know when to stop singing and you feel like you're about ready to shut the album off.      I don't really know if I can recommend a purchase.  Let's put it this way- this is definitely NOT your ordinary folk rock style, but you will only be able to enjoy it if you happen to think very highly of the lead singers voice.  It's just too bizarre for me to put into words.      It's your call.  It's not really a classic album if you ask me, because there's too much of a goofy side to the entire thing for me to recommend EVERYONE listen to it.  But then again, it's very very different from any other kind of folk rock I've been exposed to, so in that respect, maybe you should hear it.  I just don't know!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Beautiful movie. Have to watch it every year at least once. Even better that you have the option to see it in B&W or Color!
B00004WEJZ|4.0|I love this movie.  But, be forewarned, I also love License To Kill.  These are two Bond movies that seem to have either love 'em or hate 'em appeal.  I guess because they stray a bit from the norm.  This one's maligned because it's not an \\"official\\" James Bond film.  It's got a few faults, but those are heavily outweighed by the good.  In fact, I find myself wanting to re-watch this one more than quite a few other Bond films.  It's very refreshing seeing Bond as a human being.  Connery's body, like his car, shows wear, but as he puts it best, \\"it's still in pretty good shape.\\"  In fact, the fights in this one are very believable.  Sean has a tough time of it in many situations and has to actually think his way out of the box which is extremely refreshing.  I've always found real guys struggling to fight their way out of tough situations more exciting than super hero types versus human punching bags which is all too prevalent in films.  Here's a quick list of the bad just to get it over with (and to prove I'm not one of those love all Sean Connery Bond guys): no Monty Norman Bond theme (man! but they didn't have the rights), the actor playing M plays it mockingly, Rowan Atkinson (whom I absolutely adore) is completely out of place as a cartoonish doofus in what is overall a relatively serious entry, not Desmond Llewelyn as Q, some may find the video game scene dated, some may find the running time a little long.  Now for the good (oh, yeah!): Connery is fantastic (human, charming, witty, tough, etc.), Barbara Carrera creates one of the sexiest and most wicked Bond villainesses ever, Kim Basinger is smokin' hot, Brandauer's Largo (the main baddie) is one of the slimiest and realistic Bond villain's in history, gorgeous locations and beautiful underwater photography, suspenseful shark scene, the exploding pen (boom!), a terrific opening twist, witty one-liners spoken to perfection by Connery (\\"I made you all wet.\\", \\"Yes, but my martini's still dry.\\"; \\"Mr. Bond, I needa urine sample.  Could you fill this beaker for me?\\", \\"From here?\\"; \\"You know that making love to Fatima was the greatest pleasure of your life.\\", \\"Well, to be perfectly honest, there was this girl in Philadelphia...\\", \\"SHUT UP!\\", ETC.).  If you haven't seen this one, definitely check it out.  It's a blast!
B001QB9H1K|5.0|I got this film because I liked the previous Transporter movies.  If you're looking for the movie of the century, skip this one.  If you're looking for great martial arts, car chases, and some great ideas, this is a tremendous movie.  And the sound!  If you get the blu-ray and have a decent receiver, you get 7.1 Dolby digital HD Master, and the sound rocks!  Just depends on what you like in movies.  For me, this was a great ride.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|What a letdown.  What a mess.  What a shame.  I'm sorry, but when an action movie's set pieces are edited together in 1-3 second bursts before switching angles, you're in for anything but excitement.  Right off the bat, there's a \\"car\\" chase (CGI enhanced car chase) that will have you saying, \\"who's who?\\" and \\"where are they?\\" and \\"now where are they?\\" in relation to the other vehicles and roads/tunnels involved.  Come on, gimme some real cars in wideshots with some friggin' establishing shots, for Pete's sake, so that we can see the actual vehicles and stunt drivers doing their thing.  That's what makes car chases exciting, the cars, not shots of actors in close up pretending to turn steering wheels.  Throughout the entire movie, the action's edited this way.  Are stupid kids today so text happy trigger fast that movie makers are catering to their lack of attention spans?  Just like texts, these action scenes are fast and full of nothing.  And the story...  What the heck was it?  A guy trying to control a region's water supply from a base conveniently located in a desert so it's easier to film without extras mucking up the scenery?  Yawn.  I hate to be harsh on anything Bond, but this one ranks way down on the list.  To be fair, there were some good things in this film, as it's hard to completely destroy a character and series that has such a solid foundation, so here they are: pretty locales, pretty lead actress, pretty opera scene, and good hand to hand combat.  The bad: muddled story, homages/rip-offs of other Bond films (Goldfinger girl becoes Oilfinger girl, rogue Bond done better in License To Kill), tongue-in-cheek violence and predictable action pieces, and horrible 1-3 seconds per frame editing.  Bond has not lasted almost 50 years by being a ripped ab thug who just runs around beating people up.  He's cool, calculating, and classy.  Gimme a Bond that has to sweat it out a little before coming up with an ingenius escape.  Bond films are famous for their unforgettable action/escape set-pieces (the slow burning laser to the groin, the fight in the train compartment, the ski jump off a cliff, being pulled underwater into coral while bleeding in shark infested waters, etc.)  This film had one, a short hand-to-hand fight that could've been in a martial arts movie instead of a Bond film.  Bond films are famous for their witty dialogue (\\"No, Mr. Bond. I expect you to die\\", \\"Speak now or forever hold your ...\\", \\"He disagreed with something that ate him\\", \\"The b*tch is dead\\", etc.).  I can't remember any in this one.  Bond films are even known for their pathos (Connery reacting to Shirley Eaton's dead body painted in gold, Lazenby reacting to Diana Rigg's car crash death, Moore learning that he had killed Barbara Bach's lover, Dalton discovering Priscilla Barnes' ravaged body still in her wedding gown, Brosnan holding Sophie Marceau after shooting her in cold blood, Craig consoling Vesper during her breakdown in the shower, etc.)  None of that anymore.  This Bond dumps a body in a dumpster which is as close as we get, unless you think his offhanded words to M about a gratuitous Bond girl having basically been a good worker after she's killed deep stuff.  Even M seems to be tired of this Bond.  Who can blame her?  He just goes around killing people out of vengeance from an earlier film and/or just because they get in his way.  A lot of the action in this was directed/performed/edited by a Bourne Identity action unit and it shows.  It's kinetic, fast paced, MTV video crap.  I'm not a big fan of Bourne Identity fight scenes other than the brutality of them comes across as semi realistic.  You cannot see any of the actual movements in detail, though.  Also, Bond is not Bourne.  Jason Bourne had a real motive for finding the people he's after; he had lost his memory which gave motivation for finding people who might be able to clue him in on his past which often gave things a real twist as you found out who he was along with him.We already know who Bond is.  So does he.  Bring back the clever, suave Bond.  Bring back the human Bond who gets beat up at times but is so determined to survive that he thinks his way out of situations.  Bring back real chases and stunts to be sipped and savored.  Real stunts have perhaps become Bond's biggest trademark and cannot be replaced with quick editing and CGI enhancements (that awful Die Another Day avalanche surf scene should've been the end of that nonsense, but it's back with dangling rope bells on).  This Bond was shaken and stirred so much that most of the martini wound up all over the floor.  Better luck next time, 007.

B001R0KH3M|5.0|I have been WONDERing for years...why no Stevie Wonder live dvd? The wait is over..and this is a brilliant collection of old and new...stunning back up band....a wildly enthusiastic crowd and a hi-def WONDER! I could quibble about a song choice here or there but for goodness sake...this is one of the great WONDERS in the history of music so 5 stars is still not enough. Great camera work, great sound, did I mention the stellar back up 14 piece band?    The opening number Miles Davis' \\"All Blues\\" which finds Stevie playing it on harmonica is enough to warrant the purchase...he is as much a virtuoso on that as Miles was on trumpet...maybe greater.    I am listening/watching to him sing \\"Isn't she Lovely\\" right now...and I truly have goose bumps!    I could have lived with a bit less audience participation ...which would make a CD of this less enjoyable...but that is a minor distraction.  the BLu-ray and regular DVD feature the same menu and options (I bought both so I could watch away from my big screen) so enjoy at long last Stevie Wonder live!!!!!

0312427999|1.0|I made the big mistake of telling a liberal friend of mine that I would read The Shock Doctrine (since she was so sure Bush was evil and manipulated the war and hurricane situations in order to make sweeping changes to our freedoms, our regulations, and to donate the big bucks to his friends etc.) Not being a Bush fan or voter, I feel I gave this a fair read.<br /><br />Reading the dense (and not particularly well-written) nonfiction and analyzing its blatant bias and distorted history was like reading a overly-long book report for high school.  It was as if Klein believed that if she threw every fact and figure in but the kitchen sink, her premise would be believed.<br /><br />The reading was tiring, especially since there was no pretense of objectivity.  No accepting the fact that all systems of gov't, and monetary systems, and people in general use a time of crisis to make a change (big often)...even in our own nonpolitical lives.

This is called reasonable action.  Opinions will differ on what is best new policy (Patriot Act?), what is corruption vs. above-board change (no-bid contracts?), what punishments fit (Git-mo?), what is reasonable action, etc.  It is our constitution that is supposed to guide us and prevent our leaders from taking away our right to pursue happiness, our first ammendment rights (ie. Patriot Act), second ammendment rights, etc.<br /><br />I'm never convinced in the book that Capitalism itself is at the heart of the abuse by post-crisis politicians...in fact...my own knowledge of world history tells me that she picks and chooses what she puts under her microscope very carefully indeed.<br /><br />I found clearly hidden attempts to discredit Capitalism with false, distorted, and exaggerated claims - her use of many quotes and statistic doesn't hide what she's doing except maybe for a reader who has already bought into her premise before they read the book.ted, and exaggerated claims - her use of many quotes and statistic doesn't hide what she's doing except maybe for a reader who has already bought into her premise before they read the book.

0060557818|3.0|I discovered Neverwhere by accident, and honestly that's how the book reads: like an accident. Though the premise seems interesting enough -- he created the book after having helped create the BBC show, Neverwhere --the story itself in book form fails to deliver.<br /><br />The characters lack depth in general, and no character more so than that of Door, the protag. Where she should be the force behind the plot, her character ends up reading flat and lackluster. She stumbles through the story with an alarming lack of energy and her chemistry on the page with other characters is nearly non existent.<br /><br />Having read 'Good Omens,' and 'American Gods,' I've come to expect better work from this author. Sadly though, while the concept for 'Neverwhere' certainly holds a lot of potenial, on the page it does not excite. Gainman fails to anchor his plot, cemement his characters or maintain his details. The story lacks meat, and it certianly left me hungry for better fare.
B000000OAH|3.0|This is one of the later Queen releases, that I feel lacks some of the imagination of their previous work.  Each member is represented and contributes at least one song to the disk.  Most of the songs are alright, with inclusion of some of the songs from the \\"Flash Gordon\\" sound track, but I feel there are few standouts.  \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\" was the single, which is a step down from their more sophisticated tunes.  I can understand that they were looking for a quirky release, but this does not work for me.  In all, it is a decent release, with very few great moments.
B00005JXY3|5.0|I have seen all of the Karate Kid movies and must say that this is my favorite out of them all. The plot is rather interesting, and I'm glad some Japanese culture (which I find fascinating) got put into the story. One of the best things I liked was seeing how Daniel grew since the first one, and it was obvious he has done so quite a bit. He is now a more competent fighter, able to stand up against Chozen who is the number one student of Mr. Miyagi's rival Sato, and is even more knowledgeable concerning karate principles in general.    The fight scenes are not overly impressive, but they're pretty fun to watch nonetheless. I must admit that this movie is what got me interested in karate, which I study more in principle rather than actual fighting, at least currently.    The only thing I was a bit annoyed by was nearly everyone in Okinawa, Japan speaking English to Daniel and especially each other. I get that it was a creative decision because it would be tedious for Mr. Miyagi or even Kumiko (Daniel's love interest) translating Japanese for Daniel constantly. Overall, it's not that big of a deal to me.    \\"The Karate Kid Part II\\" has a lot of elements that I'm sure all types of people would enjoy: action, drama and a bit of romance all entwined to make an excellent sequel to the already classic first one. I highly recommend this movie.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|From Soundgarden to Temple Of The Dog to Audioslave to computer generated pop. Why? There better be a good reason for this album because I am insulted by the transition that Chris Cornell has made here. If he can convince me that this is supposed to be an artistic statement and a natural progession from what he achieved in the past then I will buy every album Timbaland has ever produced. I wonder if he can play this to members of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Audioslave, and any fan of the music he has created over the years with a straight face? It's totally embarassing. Can this album honestly sit in his catalogue next to albums like Euphoria Morning and Superunknown? What about making a playlist with his song \\"Seasons\\" alongside this stuff. This better be a once off cause he is losing his musical credibilty which I once thought was going to be an enduring legacy.           Good songs are good songs but bad production is bad production. Chris Cornell writes great songs but he needs to please the fans sometimes and use the type of production style that brought life to his songs on albums like Superunknown, Down On The Upside, and Euphoria Morning. Furthermore alot of the lyrics on Scream are very cringe-worthy and lack the abstract thought and metaphors of his earlier work.     If you can make it to the end of this album there's a \\"hidden track\\" that is absolutely awesome. It has a dark and bluesy feel with Cornell's powerful and raspy vocals backed up with some nice guitar playing. We can only hope this is a teaser of what might happen on the next album.

0525951113|5.0|Just finished it and was already hoping that Freedom was coming out sooner rather then later.  The book Daemon is rich in chracters, plot lines, and multiple layers.  As one reviewer mentions it feels very polished which i respect, and felt that the author was really trying to put the best product out that he could.  This is one of those excellent vacation books, or just an all around good read.  Matt Sobol the evil genius striking from beyond the grave is a villian on par with most good Bond villians, and his creation the Daemon is as coldly efficient as a Terminator.  I loved all of the hi-tech wizardry from on-line gaming, \\"out of thin air\\" speakers and of course all of the \\"other\\" gear.  Charles Mosley had to be one of my favorite characters along with Jon Ross, and of course Pete Sebeck.  Eagerly awaiting the sequel sir!!!!!!  My only complaint is that towards the end it feels a bit rushed with the final chase and quickly escalating \\"matters\\".  Other then that i have no complaints and thought it was an excellent book well worth the time, and energy.  ENJOY!!!!!
B001E5FYS8|3.0|When I initially purchased this CD (2), I felt a little silly. What? No car crashes? No murders? No sexually explicit scenes? It was soooo good. THEN it received an Academy Award! WELL . . . it was even better! How to  Wire-Walk Between the World Trade Center Towers for Dummys. Mary M.
B001FBSMF8|4.0|A lot of the criticism lodged against this album seems to be based on the expectations carried over from previous albums. Cornell has branched out and tried something extremely different from his previous work.  While it's not a hard rock album by any means, it is certainly a very well-done, well-produced piece of electronic pop.  Cornell's voice mixes well with Timbaland's production, and this, in the end, comes off as a soulful, cool sounding soundtrack for the club, the radio, a night out or a night in.  Just because an artists does something different, outside the expectations of his main fan base, does not mean he has created a failure.  Cornell does and excellent job at doing something new, and people coming to it devoid of the expectation that this will sound like one-piece with his previous work will be shocked, possibly disappointed, and maybe even angered, but it does not mean it is a bad album.  It is simply the gap between fan expectation and artistic direction.  Scream shows Cornell to be a broader artist than previously thought, and demonstrates his ability to succeed outside of the niche he has been pigeon holed into by his adoring masses.
B000003B6J|5.0|N.W.A. Straight Outta Compton ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Your about to witness the strength of street knowledge,\\" and with that I was sold. N.W.A.'s major label debut Straight Outta Compton was and still is one of the most important albums in the history of rap. Not to mention that is one of the genres five greatest albums of all time and my personal favorite next to Commons Be. But I am going to dare to take this to another level, Straight Outta Compton is one of the greatest Punk albums of all time. It really personifies the punk aesthetic and what it means to be oppressed. \\"sighh\\" oh when hip-hop was worth something....<br /><br />The production and sampling for this record is a large part of what makes it a classic and separates it from the majority of the hip-hop from that time so a large amount respect and accolades go to Eazy-E for his master full production.<br /><br />As for the music itself at times it's more comicals than gangsta. the classic 'F*** Tha Police,'  'If It Ain't Ruff' and the E penned '8 Ball' all make the serious subject matter seem light hearted which is a good thing because it is almost as Ice Cube, Dre and the rest of the crew were finding something good in the evil of the time. Even though the funny can be heard the material is no less serious. Straight Outta Compton being basically a concept album about what life is like for inner city central L.A. black males at the time. It's a lyrical powerhouse with stolen beats and old Isley Brother grooves. It's one of the most honestly genuine albums ever as well as one of the most important of the last twenty years.<br /><br />Straight Outta Compton is classic.

1401203078|2.0|This book really bummed me out.  I thought the first _League of Extraordinary Gentlemen_ was superb.  The second one was .. pretty good .. This one is just awful.  The \\"story\\" if you can call it that, is set in the 1950s in a slightly amplified world where postwar paranoia raged out of control and a 1984 \\"Big Brother\\" scenario has just happened in England, and ended before this book starts.  Mina and Allan meet James Bond (who is a complete jerk) and are pursued by British Intelligence across the UK.  They spend half of their time reading the Black Dossier, and the rest of the time meeting up with characters from obscure fiction.  Most of the references went right over my head; Alan Moore could just be making stuff up.  I'd have no way of knowing.  The Dossier itself contains records of past iterations of the League when it contained such luminaries as Fanny Hill, Lemuel Gulliver, and Natty Bumppo (to name a few.)  These fragments of stories look interesting (much more so than the main plot), and I found myself wishing the book had been about one of them instead of the non-story which seems to be nothing more than a framework to support a collection of Moore's unfinished notes.  The comic book ends with several pages of red/green 3-D and a saccharine paean to fiction.  Too corny to be pretentious.  Also of note: this volume is surprisingly smutty.  I was embarrassed to read it in public .. I don't mind a bit of sex if it's part of the plot, but since apparently Alan Moore has given up, and the book has no plot, all of the sex (and there's a lot of it) seems gratuitous.  No, not gratuitous .. a _little_ bit of smut would have been gratuitous.  The amount of smut (pardon me, \\"erotica\\") in this book amounts to nothing less than pandering.    Two stars because despite the horrible literary mess that it is, the art is still worth looking at.

0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan has done a fantastic job with this story of a \\"troubled teen,\\" Percy, that finds out he's the son of a Greek god, and is thrust into the adventures that would entail. His book was easy to read and the pacing and style reminded me a lot of the Harry Potter books, even if I can't get my boys to read Potter (they've seen the movies...) but they love these books.<br /><br />Even though the similarities with the Potter books are there, these are not imitations. Instead, you're thrust into a layered mystery that keeps you trying to figure out \\"whodunnit\\". The mystery and adventure are beautifully woven together with adventure, fun characters, and a fast pace.<br /><br />After my boys read through the first 4 books in an amazingly short time, my \\"to be read\\" pile disappeared so I thought I'd give these books a try. I'm very glad I did. The pacing was fantastic and, as with all of the well-written pre-teen books, the writing gives you enough to picture what's going on, without the (often overly) detailed passages of adult fiction. And Rick keeps you hooked by ending each chapter at just the right spot, making you want to keep reading.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun read, that both you and your kids will enjoy, I highly recommend it. Heck, they might even get interested in Greek mythology because of these books. I know my boys did.<br /><br />- Lonnie Ezell, author of the fantasy thriller, [[ASIN:1430312637 Daughter of the Sun]].

B001N26GFM|4.0|2008 was a very big year for films adapted from books, with several reaching the high acclaim of Academy Award nominations.  One adapted film that didn't get much recognition, however, is The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, based on the novel by John Boyne.<br /><br />The film opens with the following quote emblazoned on the screen:  \\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.\\"  As the quote suggests, this is a sort of coming of age film, and over the course of 94 minutes,those in the audience slowly watch the innocence of children unravel before their eyes as the reality of what is taking place becomes more and more illuminated.<br /><br />The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is the story of a family living in Berlin during World War II. The main character, an eight-year-old boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), spends his time in Berlin playing with his friends and reading adventure novels.  His father, brilliantly played by David Thewlis (most will recognize him as Professor Lupin from the Harry Potter franchise), soon gets a promotion, however, and Bruno, his parents, and his sister move to the German countryside where his father will take up his new position.  Unlike their time in Berlin, Bruno's parents are careful to keep their son close to home, and Bruno, an explorer and adventurer at heart, is confined to the small fenced area surrounding their house.<br /><br />From his bedroom window, Bruno can see what he thinks is a strange farm off in the distance.  He notices that the \\"farmers\\" act strangely and wear strange \\"pajamas\\" while they work.  Later, he notices that the smokestacks on the farm give off an absolutely wretched stench when they are burning.  By now, of course, the audience knows that what Bruno has seen is not a farm at all, and that his father's new position is Commandant of the nearby concentration camp.<br /><br />The naive Bruno manages to escape from the grounds of his home and is finally free to explore the woods behind the house.  Not paying much attention to where he is going, he happens upon a remote part of the camp where he meets another eight-year-old boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), confined by a different kind of fence. The two become friends, and Bruno sneaks away every chance he gets to go and visit the only playmate he has found since moving away from Berlin.<br /><br />This is an interesting film on many accounts, the most fascinating being the changes that each member of Bruno's family undergoes.  His father, a seemingly reluctant, \\"political only\\" Nazi at the beginning, devolves into a hardened, harsh man.  Bruno's sister Gretel (Amber Beattie), encouraged by a handsome lieutenant working with her father, falls victim to the Aryan propaganda so much that her room is soon filled with posters of the Fuhrer, much like young girls today would adorn their walls with images of the Jonas Brothers. Finally, there's Bruno's mother (Vera Farmiga), who is the antithesis to the growing Nazism in her family.  At first she is happy for her husband and the success he has as a soldier in the German army.  However, as she learns more about her husband's new charge, and the truth is revealed about the camp, she becomes bitter and angry.<br /><br />And then there's Bruno.  All the signs are there.  Bruno comes across every hint he possibly could as to the truth behind the \\"farm\\" where his friend Shmuel lives and works.  Yet he remains utterly oblivious.  Caught between the two stages of \\"sounds and smells and sights\\" and \\"the dark hour of reason,\\" the filmmakers show the great price of failing to deal with the world around us.<br /><br />Much of the criticism that I've read regarding this film deals with the supposed overextension of innocence to both child characters.  Many critics cannot grasp the idea of an eight-year-old child not understanding that the \\"farm\\" is really a horrible work camp, that the \\"pajamas\\" are prison clothes, that the mysterious disappearancesthat Shmuel tells of and the smoke from the chimneys are the results of the systematic slaughter of the camp's inhabitants.  That may be a fair criticism, but I think it misses the greater point that the filmmakers seem to be making.<br /><br />Bigger than a child's loss of innocence, Bruno seems to be a representation of Germany, perhaps even humanity, itself, and the failure to deal with the evil right before one's very eyes.  So many Germans claimed the innocence that we see in Bruno, saying they had no knowledge of the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem that Hitler and his SS were carrying out across the European continent.  Even today, despite all the existing evidence, there are still those that deny the Holocaust happened, not wanting to acknowledge the great evil of which humanity, perhaps even their neighbors and family members, is capable.  More than anything else, this film shows the great price humanity pays for such utter naivete.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very well done film.  The story, though slow in the beginning, is engaging, thought-provoking, and, in the end, heart-wrenching.  It is well-acted, especially in the performances of the young boys, and the bright colors and airy score provide a sort of bizarre juxtaposition to what is happening on screen.<br /><br />The DVD includes the typical bonus features of deleted scenes and a feature-length commentary, as well as a featurette entitled \\"Friendship Beyond the Fence.\\"the results of the systematic slaughter of the camp's inhabitants.

B001KOFH2G|4.0|If I had a gaming device that plays Blu-ray, there would be 5 stars, as Universal Studio's Serenity [[ASIN:B001KOFH2G Serenity [Blu-ray]]] goes into my list of Blu-ray films that don't fare well on a Blu-ray player. Universal was kind enough to answer my questions about my Blu-ray's message at the start of the movie, \\"resume off\\"; that is, the film must reload from the very beginning, trailers and all, if the film is stopped. Universal said this problem would not happen on a gaming device or a player that can connect to the internet. Serenity's extra features (a lot of them) require that connection. Similar problems occurred with Fox's Die Hard 2:  Die Harder [[ASIN:B000W4HIXG Die Hard 2 - Die Harder [Blu-ray]]].  Contrary to advertising hype, Warner's Demolition Man did not play properly from a regular DVD, playing well only in full-screen mode (widescreen played with comments by the director). The anomalies I have found with a Blu-ray player aside, Serenity is a visual wonder and well worth the purchase if it will be played on a compatible device. Universal did a great job on this film.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|Hollywood has always thought of itself as the be all to end all. But the elite have always held fast that foreign films were the way to go. So Hollywood has chosen to remake a number of foreign films with highs and lows in success. A new film is already set for remake but this week finds the original released on DVD.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is a hybrid film. By hybrid think of combining films. The western and sci fi flicks were married in STAR WARS. Musicals and romance films in STEP UP. This film is an even stranger mix combining coming of age, romance and horror. But then vampires and romance seem to have gone hand in hand forever, just not quite this young.<br /><br />Oskar is a 12 year old growing up in a city in Sweden. His life is fairly boring with the exception of the school bully picking on him most of the time and Oskar doing nothing in retaliation.<br /><br />A new neighbor moves into the apartment next to Oskar and his mother, a late middle aged man and a young girl. Oskar notices the covered windows but doesn't realize why until much later.<br /><br />Sitting in the courtyard on the jungle gym, Oskar first meets Eli. Clad in thing clothes and barefoot, he asks if she isn't cold. Her reply is that she isn't that she doesn't remember how to be cold. And so begins an unusual friendship.<br /><br />The man living with Eli is her benefactor. His job is to provide her a place to stay and fresh blood so that she doesn't have to go out and hunt, thus placing herself in jeopardy. But he's beginning to slow down, failing to complete the tasks. While one victim does die, his blood isn't captured and brought home requiring Eli to go out on her own. The attack is simple but seen and when people begin to talk about a child killing a full grown man, few believe the tale.<br /><br />Oskar and Eli begin to spend time together while Oskar's mother is at work. The required invitation to a vampire for entry is offered and Eli enters the apartment. But Oskar still doesn't realize exactly what Eli is.<br /><br />When an encounter with the school bully and his pals results in Oskar having a slice on his cheek he lies to Eli (and his mother) about how he got the injury. But Eli sees the truth. And her advice to Oskar is that the next time it happens, to make sure and hit the bully...hard.<br /><br />The film moves slowly, taking it's time with the timid pacing to set the stage. We begin to see Oskar starting to have a bit more confidence in himself. And when he finally does take on the bully, we cheer for him and at the same time worry that he will be changed to a more horrendous figure.<br /><br />As for Eli, her need to attack comes out after her benefactor fails his own plot for murder, leaving her with no one to fetch nourishment for her. The attacks she makes are the most disturbing images seen in this film. Thoughts of a child doing such horrible deeds are the things of nightmares.<br /><br />Eli reveals herself to Oskar but not before he puts her to a test: entering his apartment without the required invitation. The results are disturbing but soon forgotten. The strangest part is that Oskar has moved from his timid victim to a defensive individual able to stand up for himself, even to Eli.<br /><br />When the murders begin to set the stage for Eli being caught its time to move on. But not before one final moment when Oskar is beset not by just the bully but by his older brother, a budding psychopath if there ever was one.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN has been hailed as a terrifying film for fans of the genre. But as I watched I never found myself frightened. I did find the film fascinating in its depiction of a world I've never seen, Sweden. And the characters were enough to hold my interest, especially the interaction between the pair as they discovered one another.<br /><br />If your cup of tea is the rapid paced films seen more often than not then this movie isn't for you. If you like something with a bit more substance that takes it's time to tell you the story then you might want to give it a try. The effects are not gore filled, the feeling is eerie and the tale is original. And once the story finishes, you might think twice before opening the door to anyone.are not gore filled, the feeling is eerie and the tale is original.

B001UOVP1S|1.0|I think it's time for an intervention.  We need to assemble all of Cornell's family and close friends for a tearful but constructive and honest look at what his life has become.  He'll then be placed into a supervised lock down with nothing to listen to but Blues and Classic Rock albums for a period of no less than 6 months.  When that period ends, he will be permitted to remove his headphones and pick up a musical instrament of his choosing.  If he grabs a guitar and starts riffing on some tastey Blues licks, we'll know that he is sane and has his mojo back.  If goes to a turntable and starts scratching out beats then we will know that he has not been properly rehabilitated and will have to go through another 6 months of reconditioning.  It will be good for him and most of all, is our only hope for a healthy recovery.  I wish him godspeed.

0061245097|2.0|Cat Crawfield is a half-vampire vampire hunter in love with a master vampire.  This makes her sound like one of those homophobic, closeted gays, but it's the human world that doesn't trust her, not the vampire world.  No matter how often she lays her life on the line as part of a super-secret FBI branch, she can't earn the trust of her boss.<br /><br />It's Cat's boyfriend Bones who drags the story down.  He's perfectly handsome, has superhero-like attributes (strong, fast, smart, etc.) and has an annoying Central Casting English accent (\\"Give us a kiss, love\\").  Furthermore, he has only positive consequences from being a vampire - he's an ad for being a vampire.  He can renew and heal a human by biting them. When being mortal is in all ways inferior to being a vampire, you lose a lot of the inherent tension in the human-vampire relationship.  Why don't we all become vampires, and then we can do all the cool stuff that vampires do too?<br /><br />One Foot in the Grave is the second book in the Night Huntress series.  I admit to not reading the first book.  It put me at somewhat of a disadvantage, as there were lots of background interjections that slowed me down trying to follow them, and I missed Cat's full back story.<br /><br />Readers who enjoy supernatural series but are flexible about their vampire mythology [...] loyalists, this means you) might enjoy the Night Huntress series.  More demanding readers should look elsewhere unless they're stuck at an airport.

The book will make you cry even more than the movie did (I had to stop reading it a couple of times on the train because I started to cry). I probably don't care too much about the writing because I'm not the best writer either, but I didn't read the book to be challenged by reading. I didn't really notice the HORRIBLE writing that everyone is talking about. I read it because I wanted to laugh and cry and everything else that this book makes a person feel. The movie is just LOOSELY based on the novel, but overall I thought the book was better, I'm not a big fan of Hillary Swank but Gerard Butler will make me want to watch any movie, which is how I ended up finding out about this book anyway.<br /><br />But overall I say if you enjoyed the movie and want more of a story and more details.

But while Sleeping Beauty hinted at the possibilities of what Blu-ray can and will do, Pinocchio has set the standard. Not only does this film look fantastic after (what had to be a) spare-no-expense restoration, but the Blu-ray is a completely immersive experience (packed with fantastic bonus features) that is just as much of a work of art as the original. This is especially true when you consider the detailed artistry that went into the fantastic \\"Disney View\\" presentation option, which adds new drawings by Disney artists to the left and right sides of the frame to fill the picture size of today's HD TVs.    And, while I've never been a fan of Disney adding new \\"music videos\\" to their classic film releases, if these karaoke cover-versions attract a new generation to discover magical films like this one, then so be it.

0689877803|5.0|The Dealer  The Dealer is a sequel to the first book, The Recruit, from the CHERUB series. If you liked the first, The Dealer is three times more exciting. This book is about Miami and illegal drug transportation. James had just finished from his last mission, then a few weeks later he was called in for another one that was even more dangerous and difficult.  Miami has always been the drug capital of the world, James was sent on a mission there because a cocaine dealer, and professional boxer, Keith Moore had been importing and exporting drugs more than usual. The reason that they sent James was because he needed to befriend his son Junior Moore and be a street dealer for Keith. He needed to do this so James would be around their house, while hanging out with Junior, and be able to plant bugs and cameras to figure out when his next deal was, but there were some men that Keith had scammed and they are coming after him.  This book is upbeat, exciting, and has another side story along with it. I recommend this book to anyone who likes action/adventure books, and for people who like comedy.  By: Tristan Litzo

0061191981|2.0|I've just finished this on the Kindle (excellent experience), and while I would love to sing the praises of this autobiography, I simply can't. I really like Ramsay. He's obviously someone who worked his butt off to get to where he is and he's very straightforward. But the man needs an editor. This book is all over the place. It seems like it's in rough chronological order, then it dives deep into his relationship with his brother, then in a shallow way into the women in his life, all the time sounding like polished journal entries that were assembled into a book in a matter of hours.   So the editor could have helped with that: a clear outline.   Then there are the inconsistencies. I have no doubt that Ramsay is an honest man, but he's not particularly careful with reality-as-truth. Did he watch Billy Elliot on stage or screen? Depends on which sentence you read. How much customer research did he do before opening his Scottish restaurant? Depends on where in the book you read about it.   So the editor could have helped with that: wrangling a consistency out of Ramsay.   These are obviously stories he's told many, many times, and he's developed a way of telling them that rounds the rough edges, and by that I don't mean the negative parts--he doesn't canonize himself. So I can understand it.   Finally, the chronology of the rapid rise of his restaurant empire completely puts the brakes on the flow of the book. It's like being served a meal where the plates are interesting, sure, but they are seen as the most important part of the dish. And again, the editor could stop in and tell Ramsay that in this remarkably short book, we only need to hear ONCE about how Hartnett is going to get her own restaurant in New York if the Miami one's a winner.   Fans like me will enjoy this but wish it were executed better. It is nice to \\"hear\\" Ramsay's voice so clearly in this, but after a while it is fatiguing--everything is voiced as if he were giving one of his quiet, conspiratorialcamera chats on Kitchen Nightmares. Speaking of which, he only uses the term pear-shaped once! Amazing! What restraint!

It was blues, dirty and real, and you could draw the direct line from rock to its progenitor.  Love that album.<br /><br />Now I come back to the Keys and...I guess I should have known from the title that there would be too much fancy computer pyrotechnics involved.  I guess they didn't want to warn us by putting in Decay or Sustain in the title.<br /><br />Music's not bad.  It's just not Black Keys great is all.  I prefered man, guitar, other man, drums.  I'll give it a couple more listens, but it's not going in heavy rotation.

Will he gain as many new fans as he loses old fans with this comical release?    There is a fine line between 'bold' and 'stupid' .... this lack of effort is stoopit.  Taking your music in a new direction is bold.  Jumping into the abyss of untalented, over produced, lip synchers is a very questionable career move.  I'm embarrassed for the guy.      For those that call this 'experimentation' - No it is not.  It has already been done by other pseudo musicians like Madonna, or Britney, or Justin.  They are not musicians.  Chris Cornell fans (like myself - and no I don't expect every release to be Sndgrd or Audslv)appreciated him as a musician and liked his music because it was NOT Madonna, or Britney, or Justin.

Do you think that is an exageration ?  Well not at all , a good half of the book is dedicated to this discussion .  As for  the first half we learn that Lee Smolin thinks that QM , GR and string theory have all fatal flaws .   He also (wrongly) thinks that physics stopped since he (Lee Smolin) began to interest himself in physics .  I know it is a bit short but that's about it .    It might well be the reasons why he can't do any real physics .  In any case read this book only if you are interested what is the trouble with Lee Smolin  .  If you are interested by physics read Feynman instead .

B000IFS0HM|4.0|the book is well written. The language changes as Frank grows up in the novel.  Some parts a bit slow but packed with experience. Then other parts fire story at you quickly for effect.  I hope this doesn't give too much away but at points I kept reading just to find out who survives.
0007240198|5.0|Maybe you are unfamiliar with Ben, maybe because he is a Brit, maybe because you don't read the Guardian newspaper (for shame), or maybe because you skip Ben's piece because he plays rough? Well for years I've been turning to his column first. Now there is a great book.    Ben's Bad Science is a brilliant, well-argued polemic against charlatanism of all kind.    I was first drawn to him as he exposed my favorite pet peeve - homeopathy. Then he trained his sights on the food supplements industry and its 'anti-oxidant' and 'super-food' shenanigans.    But Bad Science doesn't just take aim at alternative quackery.    Ben takes aim at Big Pharma for its shady research practices, and shameful marketing practice. (Thank Jesus he doesn't live in the US with its prime-time onslaught of drug advertising - I don't think his blood pressure could take it.) He takes aim at Big Media - for misrepresenting and misusing science and for irresponsible reporting (MMR and MRSA).    Well done Ben. If in your lifetime you can, chipping away, restore some sanity to the public understanding of science - you will make us all better off.    Check out his site: [...]    Paul Gibbons
B001FBSMF8|3.0|I think Chris Cornell's voice sounds really amazing on the new CD.  I've been a huge fan of his for about 16 years. I am a fan of his voice - first and foremost. I give him props for trying something different on each of his solo albums. I think on some of the songs on \\"Scream\\", Timbaland overproduces it to the point I think about what Chris would have done if he was in charge of producing this album. Sometimes the slick production works for songs like \\"Ground Zero\\" (A song I've liked since I heard it last year. It's got a really funky beat). It's not overdone. But I do not like the production on \\"Sweet Revenge\\" because I want to hear Chris' voice not Chris' voice through a synthesizer or keyboard whatever it is.  Then I think about how amazing his new music does sound great live.  I saw CC perform last summer on the Projekt Revolution tour.  \\"Watch Out\\" and \\"Scream\\" sound excellent live. I actually recorded \\"Scream\\" on my digi camera and uploaded to youtube last year. You can be the judge of this yourself:  [...]  All I can say is that this CD sounds great on my car stereo! I already tested it out tonight and I'm very happy about it. I think this album is suppose to sound great with headphones too.  I don't own headphones so I can't give an honest opinion.  Scream is worth picking up. I do recommend it.

B001GKJ2DO|2.0|Either way, I cannot believe the good reviews for this movie, not only those written here but the raves from my good friends and family who thought this film was so much fun!  I saw the Broadway show   during its opening week on Broadway in 2001 and it was sensational.  It was about a month or two after 9/11 and God knows New Yorkers needed something to take their minds of the recent tragic events and this show filled that request for 2 hours on an Autumn night, with singing and dancing in the aisles of the theater.  This film however, does not come close to the magic of the stage production.  It would have been nice to try and find actors that could actually sing and not just light up a marquee.  I used to think I could watch Colin Firth read the phone book - - maybe I still could but could not tolerate him singing one.  I am not going to explain the story  in this review as it has been done already.  All I can offer is a bunch of great actors that cannot sing who are all seriously miscast in a musical.  Go see the stage production - It's wonderful -  ABBA is wonderful - This film is NOT WONDERFUL!
B001QWEE4E|5.0|It is tragic the way that gay people are unable to share love and have all of the things that the rest of us take for granted.  This film is a sad story of two men stuck in a world where they are unable to love or be who they were born to be.  Having to try to adapt and deal with a society that shuns them.  (Example in other review).  I learned a lot from watching this film and know that it has helped me to understand how difficult some peoples struggles can be.  Especially for men, because of all of the expectations that society places on them.  The actors were great and the story is really good.  Watch this movie and open up your mind a litte to other people's struggles.
B001FBSMF8|3.0|I'm a big Chris Cornell fan and I saw him perform Scream in its entirety months before the CD came out.  It was perplexing to say the least.  Yes, Timbaland is responsible for production on several of today's Top 40 albums - including Justin Timberlake's \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\" and the music on this record - at times - sounds like a carbon copy of that record.  \\"Scream\\" sounds exactly like you would expect it to sound if Justin's vocals were replaced by Chris's on \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\".  Timbaland's pop sensibilities and Cornell's rock vocal never manage to integrate.    \\"Never Far Away\\" is a pretty cool jam, but you'll be forgiven if you liked the song better when it was called \\"What Goes Around...Comes Around...\\".  The title track is also decent, but suffers from Timbaland's weak vocal.  \\"Scream\\" has little of the rawness, heart, and soul that made \\"Euphoria Morning\\" such a criminally underrated masterpiece.  That being said, as generic and misguided as \\"Scream\\" is, it is infinitely more listenable than Cornell's last album \\"Carry On\\".

B001UOVP1S|4.0|Enjoy it for what it is.  It's the evolution of Rock/Pop.  Rather than getting behind the curve, Cris is taking it where we think it shouldn't go, and for the most part, it works.

B0001XALTG|5.0|There are truly a lot of films about drug abuse, but there are a select few that shed light on the brutality of it.  I've reviewed films such as `Requiem for a Dream' and `Panic at Needle Park', two films that show the drastic measures some will go in destroying themselves for a fix; and it's within those films that the haunting realities of drug addiction becomes so real to the audience.  `Trainspotting' is similar in its honesty, yet it differs in its direction.  Some have been put off from the way that `Trainspotting' portrays drug abuse, but in my personal opinion the slight comedic edge the film possesses adds yet another layer of honesty to the film.<br /><br />Boyle's masterpiece shows the light and the dark side of addiction.<br /><br />The film centers around a group of friends who area all heavy into heroin.  They all at times strive for a better existence but are more often than not taken over by their carnal desires.  The film simply observes their conduct and exposes the reasons they stay hooked as well as the reasons they wish they weren't.<br /><br />What is so devastating about `Trainspotting' is that it nearly blindsides you with its shocking moments of truth.  This technique works very well, for it generates in us pure and genuine outbursts of emotion.  Some have mentioned a certain scene involving an infant; a scene so raw and heart-stopping that I was literally in tears.  These are the moments that benefit from the films wicked mixture of drama and humor, for it makes the impact of these scenes even more devastating.  We are friends with these people (even though we really shouldn't be) and so to watch them crumble under the weight of their disease is heartbreaking.<br /><br />The film is propelled by a commanding performance by Ewan McGregor.  He captures every ounce of Renton's immaturity as well as his worldly knowledge and strive for betterment.  He is engaging, entertaining, likable and relatable.  He's aided by a very strong cast that includes Robert Carlyle and it is here that we are introduced to the luminous Kelly Macdonald (of `No Country for Old Men' fame).  Macdonald is one of my favorites here, for her slick mix of sensuality and impish dominance is pure gold.  I just loved watching her.<br /><br />Danny Boyle's magical talents are on full display here.  I know he is a household name now thanks to his Oscar winning film `Slumdog Millionaire', but honestly he is in top form in his earlier work (see also his ravenous work on '28 Days Later').  I've always been a fan of his, and this is probably his best work.  Visually he is captivating, but he juggles both the witty and the ominous with such strength.  It's a flawless culmination of the two.<br /><br />This film is as shocking as it is engrossing; as repulsive as it is engaging.

0670020478|5.0|Why did Ken Robinson write this book? He explains in his Introduction: \\"My aim in writing it [with Lou Aroniva's assistance] is to offer a richer vision of human ability and creativity and of the benefits to us all of connecting properly with our individual talents and passions. This book is about issues that are of fundamental importance in our lives and in the lives of our children, our students, and the people we work with. I use the term [in italics] the Element [end italics] to describe the place where the things we love and the things we are good at come together. I believe it is essential that each of us find his or her Element, not simply because it will make us more fulfilled but because, as the world evolves, the very future of our communities and institutions will depend on it.\\" Throughout his narrative, Robinson cites dozens of examples of people who have made the best of themselves and of others by embracing \\"a richer conception of human capacity.\\" They have embraced the Element.<br /><br />At one point, Robinson poses an important question to his reader: How are you intelligent? \\"Knowing that intelligence is diverse, dynamic, and distinctive allows you to address that question in new ways. This is one of the core elements of the Element.\\" When people are in what is often referred to as \\"the zone,\\" they are deep in the heart of the Element. \\"We become focused and intent. We live in the moment. We become lost in the experience and perform at our peak. Our breathing changes, our minds merge with our bodies, and we feel ourselves drawn effortlessly into the heart of the Element.\\" I vividly recall Michael Jordan sinking one three-point shot after another (\\"all net\\"), especially in playoff games. The same can be said of creative and performing artists as well as athletes who have found a \\"new richness and balance to their lives...a more dynamic, organic conception of human existence in which the different parts of [their] lives are not seen as hermetically sealed off from one another but as interacting and influencing each other.\\" They are \\"on a roll\\" because everything \\"clicks\\"...they are in the Element.<br /><br />Ken Robinson urges his readers to find the Element in themselves and to encourage others to do so, also. \\"If we fail at that, we may get by, but our lives will be duller as a result.\\"  The greater challenge, Robinson suggests, is to develop - consciously and rigorously - our powers of imagination and creativity \\"within a different framework of human purpose.\\" He concludes his brilliant book and I conclude this review of it with an especially appropriate observation by Michelangelo: \\"The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it.\\"<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Henry David Thoreau's Walden, James O'Toole's The Executive's Compass: Business and the Good Society, Michael Ray's The Highest Goal: The Secret That Sustains You in Every Moment, Eckhart Tolle's The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment and A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose, and Bill George's True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership (with Peter Sims).off from one another but as interacting and influencing each other.\\" They are \\"on a roll\\" because everything \\"clicks\\"...they are in the Element.

630521610X|5.0|The opening sequence to this teenage slasher film is one of the most memorable scenes in Hollywood history.  I know, that may seem like jumping the gun a bit, but it's not; believe me.<br /><br />Think about it; Drew Barrymore alone in a house when the phone rings right as she's setting popcorn on the stove.  She informs the caller that she's getting ready to settle down and watch a scary movie.  She loves scary movies.  The caller is dark and mysterious yet surprisingly friendly, almost so smooth he's inviting and so Drew (her name in the film is Casey) keeps talking to him.  Then he starts to scare her.  He lets her know he's watching her and when she threatens to hang up he threatens her life.  What follows may be one of the most intense scenes in the whole of horror films, and it remains one of the most memorable scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />So begins a tale of murder in a small town as local students start dropping like flies.  It's the one year anniversary of the brutal murder of young Sidney Prescott's mother and it seems that she is the next target.  Her friends try and show her support, but things look even grimmer when her very own boyfriend appears to be the masked killer.  Dealing with a killer on the loose seems like enough to get anyone frazzled, but Sidney also has to deal with local reporter Gale Weathers, who is obsessed with Sidney's mother's murder and is convinced that Sidney ID'd the wrong guy.<br /><br />As the night sets in, the body count rises and everyone is using their horror movie knowledge to try and make it to the sequel.<br /><br />What is so amazing about `Scream' is that it knows what its faults are and it exploits them.  What writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven have done is create a film that pokes fun at the horror movie stereotypes without ever falling into parody territory.  This film is genuinely scary, but it never takes itself too seriously.  It contains all the generic horror clich&eacute;s but inserts its own array of twists to deliver a fresh take on a tired genre.  This is the film that proved to be a rebirth for a genre that many had written off.<br /><br />The cast is funny and entertaining, Matthew Lillard getting major points for creating an obnoxiously entertaining character that you wanted to see in every scene.  Neve Campbell is a very pretty and very naturally charming girl who should have received a bigger career after this, and Skeet Ulrich has enough of a bad boy charm that you can see him as a suspect but hope and pray that he isn't the killer.  Jamie Kennedy didn't impress me too much, and I've never really felt McGowan was a real actress; but they are serviceable.  David Arquette is effective and Courtney Cox is brilliant (truly), but in all honesty, this movie BELONGS to Drew Barrymore, who in just merely five minutes cemented herself as the new scream queen!<br /><br />So, the film is chilling, smart, funny and wonderfully crafted.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I have always had a strong fondness for vampire films. Honestly, much of the vampire films these days are full of clich&eacute; and while most of them does attempt at something original, they all have one common denominator; to induce HORROR. Well, Sweden seems to have mastered an original take on the vampire lore and yes, this film has been marked to be \\"Americanized\\" very soon. \\"Let the Right One In\\" is a film adapted from the novel and written for the screen by John Ajvide Lindqvist with very powerful direction by Thomas Alfredson. Rather than a vampire film geared to induce scares, this film is heavy on mood that will definitely terrify and touch our very hearts.<br /><br />Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is a 12-year old boy whose parents are separated, he collects news clippings, and who gets bullied in school by his classmates. He usually wanders his apartment grounds at night while pining for vengeance against his tormentors. One evening, he meets Eli (superbly played by Lina Leanderson), a mysterious young girl of the same age with whom Oskar forms a provisional friendship. The two become quite close, as bizarre murders begin to run rampant in their community. Eli is a girl with powers that Oskar can barely understand, and she sees Oskar as an innocent, kindly soul worth preserving. Oskar sees Eli as his friend and confidant, as he becomes attracted to her. However, Eli has been twelve for quite a long time--she is a vampire. Their world is about to fall apart as things begin to spiral out of control.<br /><br />Ever wonder what would happen if a 12 year old girl is turned into a vampire at such an early age? Being an immortal stuck at this pre-teen age can become quite complicated. Well, this Swedish vampire tale attempts to answer that question. The film is a moody affair and is full of hauntingly effective emotions. The film's main focus is the relationship between Eli and Oskar, and Eli as an immortal with a tortured soul and a conscience. \\"..Right One\\" observes the naïve sensuality between pre-teens and the brutality of having to kill to survive. As an immortal, Eli is longing for companionship, there is a subtle hint that the man who brought her into Oskar's apartment complex isn't exactly her father but that definition isn't really revealed which gives Eli a sense of being an enigma.<br /><br />Eli isn't a villain, but rather also a victim. It was wise for the screenplay to treat her as another casualty rather than the antagonist--her situation itself is the film's \\"bad guy\\". \\"..Right One\\" is also a thematic affair in regards to isolation, loneliness as reflected by our two leads, and an empty life to live that requires viciousness to survive. The direction has a methodical approach, as it slowly brings Eli and Oskar together, introduces the violence without any elucidation to build on the film's psychological impact. Director Alfredson cleverly plays on how each scene of violence is shown, the violence is brutal but never for a minute do we forget about feeling sympathetic to Eli's situation. He allows the sympathy to steadily build within his audience but never for a minute does he forget to hold the viewer's interest. The way the film is shot is a form of minimalism, it avoids fancy camera shots, it lingers on some scenes to convey its mood and uses a lot of perspective. The film looks gorgeous, and the atmosphere has that darkly foreboding look that exudes sympathy accentuated further by its soundtrack.<br /><br />Of course, the film does have its dose of blood and gore, but it is very calculated. Most of it occur throughout the film as it builds towards its excellent climax. \\"..Right One\\" also has the usual rules that apply to vampires; vulnerability to sunlight, dependent on blood for sustenance, the usual powers, and the need to be invited to one's home. (It was quite interesting to see what happens to a vampire when they aren't invited to come in one's home). Eli kills her prey after she gets her fill, she doesn't want to turn anyone and she only kills because she has to. The performances by Lina Leanderson and Kare Hedebrant is just brilliant with their simplicity and the two never for a moment falter in showing their age. Their awkward but endearing relationship is the film's showstopper as it endears, charms, frightens and explores the boundaries of their friendship.<br /><br />Now, don't think that Alfredson and Lindqvist does nothing else with the script. When we aren't watching Eli and Oskar, we become privy to the paranoid community as they talk and gossip about the murders. The film goes into poetic visceral overdrive as a mistake becomes the turning point for our young leads and all hell threatens everything and turns the wheels of destiny.<br /><br />I highly doubt that this film would translate well in becoming \\"Americanized\\" in its intended remake, given its very distinct European roots (as with the case with Asian Horror). \\"Let the Right One In\\" perfectly balances visceral punch with thrilling emotions that takes its brutality into sincere purity. The film takes some chances and I commend it for asking us to forgive a child and to accept her form of evil--to give her a show of compassion and sympathy. The film is grisly, grotesque, unnervingly beautiful and gentle, and is a welcome installment in vampire lore. It features the concerns of pre-teens mixing it in with waiflike atmosphere.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I am pleased that the movie makers were faitful to the book. Two main characters were deleted and a plotline changed with Eli's caretaker but I can live with that. The movie kept to the spirit and mystery of the book. The only problem was the \\"revelation\\" of Eli's sexuality. Having read the book, I was prepared and understood what it meant but I do think the movie could have delved into Eli's backstory just a bit.    Watching the movie, the viewer understands that Oskar wants to strike back against the bullies yet has never been coached how to do so. When we see him finally strike out at his main bully, we also see a self-satisfied smile creep along Oskars face. We wonder, would he make a good vampire himself?    Reading the book does help understand what is going on but it is not necessary. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. Much of the movie is visual, without added dialouge. I hope the US version keeps to the spirit and does not alter the story into just another slasher/adventure tale.    The ending of the movie actually helps explain things a little bit better than the book. I liked the fact that the ending is basically the same but with a little added twist.    Get this movie. It does not matter if you have not read the book first because once you see the movie, you will want to read the story.    Enjoy!

006135323X|5.0|Let me just start with I did enjoy this book and would recommend it who likes to learn about human nature and the way people's minds work.  Now I'll move on to how the book is formatted.  Each chapter starts with a page or two on what the author notices or a story about an experience he had, then it usually moves on to an experiment that the author conducted, in search of a reason for the behavior he noticed, finally he explains the results that he found in the experiment.  If that sounds like it would be too formatted or strict, and may become boring after a while, it doesn't.  The author's writing style (which is very humorous and easy to read), inclusion of anecdotes pertaining to the subject make is entertaining and informative.  Another strong point of the book is how it is written in language that isn't only understandable to people getting a degree in the subject (the author even comments on how it was hard not to write in \\"academese\\"). This book is a great and quick (for a fast reader like me) read.

That being said, its a very sensitive device, its very flimsy without the cards inserted and occasionally it hangs up my PSP for an extra second or two when booting up. But you really cant beat the value for the price, as long as you aren't playing rough with this thing, then I'd recommend it 100x over.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout will kick your butt, literally! It is a balanced mix of cardio and toning exercises, all targeted to work the entire body. There are three 20 minute workouts (beginner, intermediate, advanced), and you WILL be challenged, and you WILL feel the burn. Jillian is no nonsense, realistic, and will push you. I have only done Level 1 at this point, but so far I really like it! For example, I like that she doesn't offer the modified version of the jumping jack, stating that she has 400 pound people doing it. And if a 400 pound person can do it, then so can you! The only \\"tradional\\" modified exercise is with push-ups, which is definitely helpful for people like myself who are not used to or even like doing push-ups. I have found that I can pump out 20 push-ups now without a problem! Jillian helped me realize through this DVD that I can do it. And if I can do it, then anyone can do it. Out of all the workout DVDs I have done THIS is the best one out there. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a challenge to their exercise routine.

You will thank me for not ever listening to this and having your respect for Chris Cornell go in the toilet.  As a die-hard SG fan, who owns all Audioslave, Hater, Wellwater Conspiracy, former Chris Cornell solo albums, I really don't know what to say about this.  It is nothing at all like I was expecting and not good at all.  I read the other reviews and was thinking about not buying it even though it was only $2.99 as the amazon mp3 deal of the day.  I really wish I hadn't bought it, my respect for Chris Cornell is just about down to zero now.  Maybe I can give it to my 10-year old niece, that is who it sounds like this album was made for.
B001PJRAUS|2.0|I caught some of this on tv recently, can't remember the net work.  I, myself, am an anglophile and die-hard Austen fan, and I have to say that this one wasn't worth the time I spent watching it.  I can see by the reviews that many have liked it.  My disappointment could be that anything other than the original work is a poor substitute.  I thought the story line was lacking, unbelievable, and boring.  Simply put, I thought it was pretty stupid.  I watched it for about an hour or so, and then switched to the gameshow network.  Even THAT was better than sitting through this awful awful movie.  I give it 2 stars, because the actors seemed to be very talented.  It's too bad that they now have to be forever associated with this piece of work.
0765342294|1.0|This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read. Not just SciFi either, but in all of fictional works I've read. I am a big SciFi fan so naturally I was drawn to this book based on rave reviews and endless praise. The plot of the book has already been explained ad-infinitum in the 2000+ 5 star reviews on this page so I won't add to redundancy. All I can say is that Card MUST of intended this book to be for the 15 and under crowd because there is absolutly no way that this would be taken seriously in by adult Science Fiction reader.<br /><br />I read something funny in one of the other reviewers pages comparing this to \\"DUNE\\"....yes, you read that right, \\"DUNE\\"...... are you serious?.....<br /><br />Why don't I compare some  R.L. Stine to Tolstoy? Or some Nancy Drew to Stephen King?<br /><br />Don't fall for the hype if you are expecting a rewarding SciFi read. \\"Ender's Game\\" is junk you'd find in \\"HighLights\\" magazine.<br /><br />Stay away from this waste of paper.
B001UOVP1S|4.0|I'm a huge Chris Cornell fan.  Like any master at his trade, he can sing.  I listen to Chris not just for the melody or music engineering of what's going on behind him; I listen to hear what he can do vocally that is dynamic for each song he sings.  The man is uncanny in his ability to create vocals for each song he sings that no one else can do.  He does that in Scream.<br /><br />I hardly ever listen to hip hop/pop music.  But I've listened to this album three times in the past 24 hours since my purchase because of Chris's ability to sing.  That super rock growl in an upbeat, somewhat hip hop, melody just makes you listen.  I appreciated this album and his ability to do things differently than everything else that sounds so duplicate out there in any genre.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I loved this inspirational story of the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire.  It is very humorus in parts, and even shows Mr. Wilbeforce's love story with his wife.  A very well put together film.  Great acting, great story line and a wonderful message of perseverance and the equality of all human kind.  A must see for everyone!  The descriptions may be grusome for the youngest of children (8 and under), but then they might be too young to understand those parts anyways.    I love hearing the stories of the ordinary (or not so ordinary) people who changed history that are often neglected in history books.  This movie is also pretty historically accurate.  It would even be a great study for middle school or high school social studies classes.     This movie has forever changed how the song Amazing Grace for me.  The song has muc more meaning for me now.

B00005ASHM|5.0|I had never heard, nor had I even heard much about Pet Sounds until it was first released on compact disc back in 1990. It received so much press attention and acclaim (including a Doonesbury series in which a dying AIDS patient's last words were \\"Brian Wilson is God,\\") that naturally, I had to check it out. I liked the Beach Boys, but I definitely had a preconceived notion about what they were all about - surfing, girls, cars, fun, and lots and lots of harmonies. This was something definitely different.     Looking back at the group's early catalogue - which I now possess - it's obvious that the Beach Boy's resident boy-genius songwriter and producer, Brian Wilson, had been pushing and expanding pop music's boundaries almost right from the beginning. After the The Beatles hit America in early 1964, Brian felt an extraordinary challenge not only to keep up with the rapidly evolving sounds of the times, but to stay ahead of the curve. In December 1965, the Beatles released Rubber Soul, their most accomplished and mature album to date. Wilson was absolutely floored. He immediately resolved to match it in sophistication, intelligence and beauty.     Brian began to write a series of songs with a new collaborator, Tony Asher. Instead of being fun, these were personal and musical searches - a thorough examination of the artist's soul and psyche. Intuitively sensing that these songs were so unique that a traditional rock setting would not suffice, Brian began recording sessions for large ensembles with unusual instrumentation (banjos, flutes, harpsichord, violins, etc. - along with guitar, bass and drums. The final step would be to bring the guys in the group in to lay down the vocals.     Apparently what Brian hadn't anticipated was resistance - from his record company, his father - and most importantly, other members of the group. Firmly obsessed with his vision, Brian dug in his heels and did everything he could to get the album completed the way he wanted it. Releasedin May 1966, the record - now entitled Pet Sounds (a mocking reference to Brian's so-called \\"pet project\\") - disappointed in sales for a Beach Boys album - it finally went gold in the year 2000. Its artistic effect, however, was more immediate and profound.     Musicians and the press lauded the album with a degree approaching reverence. Coming around full circle, Paul McCartney declared it the most profound album ever made - the Beatles would go on to create Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in a conscious attempt to top Pet Sounds.     But emotionally, musically and personally, nothing would ever top Brian Wilson's poignant, reflective and beautiful vision. Today, Pet Sounds stands as the ultimate icon for a young person's emergence into all the joys and anxieties of adult life and self consciousness. Historically and metaphorically, it was a massive breakthrough to the revolutionary experiments and advancements of 1960s music and culture. In a sense, Pet Sounds is a road map for the emergence of the modern psyche into the mass media, and it continues to enlighten such clearly universal concerns of rights of passage into an articulate form that can be apprehended and used as a guiding light for life.     In one refrain, Brian ethereally sings, \\"Listen, listen . . .\\" No other pop album demands such close and repeated empathetic attention - and none rewards it more thoroughly and honestly as this deep, heartfelt masterpiece. Pet Sounds remains essential to anyone's musical and emotional education - one that lasts a lifetime.
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri is one of the rare authors that I can feel the passion and joy of writing. When I read each one of her - sometimes - elaborated sentences, it comes with so much power that I cannot stop to envision, in the back of my mind, the pleasure Jhumpa Lahiri must have felt when she was putting together her thoughts on paper. Reading her brings me a ray of emotions. It is as drinking a very special wine, when all the flavors mixed together into something cohesive. Larihi is the grand cours of the literary word.       The themes are generation gap, the cultural gap, West vs. East, family, marriage, kids, death, building a career, Ivy League schools, geographic distances, love affairs, the 80s, Bengalis, New England (especially Boston and its suburbs) and a little bit of London. Anyone who has family and/or kids and/or experienced death in their family would easily relate with these story. Common household tasks, like working on the garden, washing dishes, throwing trash, are dramatically described, but the action always moves forward. All stories have beautiful ending. Sometime sadness, but never depression.    It is pure pleasure.
B001GJ2ZCA|5.0|The Followill guys have matured into a fine band. Their newest album is not for those who like simplistic straight forward music, this stuff will make you think. The Kings have thankfully left behind their early stuff where they sounded identical to The Strokes, The Hives, The Jets and that other junk.

B00158K0S8|5.0|This classic movie has been reviewed enough here so I am just reviewing the Blu-ray edition of Patton. All I can say is WOW!!! It is as if they made the movie yesterday. The sharpness is a wonder to behold. The sound will blow your socks off. I have owned this movie Patton in every version it has come out as this is one of my all time favorite movies. If you love this movie, you'll love it even more in Blu-ray. Being a movie that is 40 years old, I didn't expect much when they put this movie into Blu-ray, but they did a fantastic job. If you are making the switch to Blu-ray, and you always had this movie in your collection, you will be very happy to have this in your Blu-ray collection.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My husband and I were recently introduced to this game by a friend, and immediately bought it for ourselves.  I'm not sure why everyone says 3 or more players, my husband and I play it with just the 2 of us all the time.  We love that it's a new game every time you play, very cleverly designed.  We also found that the board gets a bit crowded with 4 people playing, so we bought the expansion pack, which we haven't tried yet.

0446402389|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It was riveting. This is the story of the Soviet Union during the 1950s, and how the denial of the Soviet government that a serial killer of children was on the loose. It's amazing how anyone could have lived through those times. It was claustrophic society. Every time it seemed that a scene was over, or that something positive was going to happen, then BAM, there was some other hurdle that the characters had to get through. It also allowed us to see the transformation of the main character, changing from someone who was had no feeling for the people's needs and believing so wholeheardedly in the stagnant and uncompromising government in which he served until he himself was subjected to its cruelty. Also, the surprise at the end when he discovered who the serial killer really is. This is an amazing and satifying novel.
0679411585|1.0|I came intrsted with this book after I saw the movie, which I saw it many times and I determined to get more information about the the real events by reading the book which was the base of the movie. but I was disappointed when I read the book and I found it not intersting. it looks as it was written by someone who dosn't know how to till a story. I don't like this book.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This is a delightful movie, and one children will enjoy watching over and over. A great family film.
0316010669|5.0|Blink was the first book I read by Malcolm Gladwell, although now I devour nearly everything he writes. Both as a psychologist and a woman, I have grown to understand the necessity of learning how to tune in to one's intuition, understand as much as possible about our \\"gut\\" feelings (and from where they may originate), and to reduce the self-talk or rationalizations that may cloud/squash our instincts.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell's insight is remarkable; he views the world in creative and non-ordinary ways that allow readers to experience \\"A-Ha!\\" moments, offering them a guide to building their ability to see their world differently as well.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|\\"Let The Right One In\\"<br />(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2009)<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />NOTE: Spoilers below.<br />-------------------------------------------------<br />In this slow, sad Swedish vampire film, a gloomy young boy named Oskar falls under the spell of a magnetic child-sized vampire named Eli... Eli moves in next door to Oskar in a large, dull, modern apartment complex where Oskar often flees to escape the cruel attentions of several sadistic school bullies. Eli sees his dilemma, and encourages Oskar to fight back, even though he is too puny to defend himself without resorting to violent, Columbine-like tactics. As Eli's vampirism slowly becomes apparent, both to Oskar and to the angry locals, the two twelve-year-olds -- one eternal, the other mortal -- grow closer and more co-dependent. Although the film is notably low-budget (and poorly dubbed, in the American re-release) it succeeds on a deeper psychological level, as viewers are constantly made to doubt Eli's altruism towards the hapless, vulnerable Oskar. Their puppy-love relationship is complicated by the revelation that Eli (pronounced like Ellie, the girl's name) was once male, a twist that is sure to be left out of the currently-scheduled American remake... Although this film is low-rent and a bit awkward, it packs a potent psychic wallop: fans of Anne Rice's \\"Interview With A Vampire\\" (the book, not the film) will love this as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film review blog)
031606792X|4.0|This book is, as promised by others who have read it, the best in the series. Several unexpected twists add to the sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat factor. It's a quick read, with a satisfactory ending. This book, and the entire series, is not high quality literary reading and is not even near the list of my favorites. It is fairly well-written, but definitely appeals more to the teen than to the adult. The love relationship between Bella and Edward is kind of annoying, as is his sudden inexplicable change of attitude towards the middle of the series. That said, it is still an enjoyable read. A guilty pleasure.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Fun, entertaining, and the sing along section was fun to do with the family. If you love musicals, you will want this one.

B0013N7AD8|1.0|1 okay movie, 1 somewhat okay movie and 2(at least 2) bombs and Warner's suggested retail is $130, it is not even close to being worth the $85 Amazon wants for it now. The set is worth about $44 total and that is being very gracious in my estimation. Mark my words in a year or so this will be hitting barging bins all over the place.

B001PPGAIA|5.0|I bought this movie even after hearing some bad reviews, and I am glad that I did. It was wonderful, I enjoyed every second of it. I heard that Nicole Kidman said that she wished she had never made this movie. She needs to get over herself. Just because it did not win any awards or get great reviews. You have to see things for yourself because sometimes the reviews can be very wrong. She should be proud of it and the good job that she did. The great job that everyone did! I wish they would make more movies like this one.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I love to see and hear top notch guitar playing by the true masters of Blues and Rock&Roll.  Eric Clapton is one of the very best and he has gathered together an amazing group of guitar players who created and played the music from the early days to the present.  I can't recommend this DVD any higher.  It's a must have so get it today.
0316017922|3.0|The successful are lucky to be born with a high IQ on the right date into the right family and lucky to love hard work. Some of the stories about success were very interesting but did not uncover any \\"secrets\\" about how success is achieved.
B000062XFG|3.0|Short and sweet. The case is fair quality, with a fold out for 7 DVDs. The menu system is a bit funky. I am collecting serveral TV Series, and would prefer that these have the \\"Play All\\" feature similar to the later years M.A.S.H. DVDs.    The second season starts out a badly disjointed story line that never made any sense as to why Dr. Beverly Crusher was no longer aboard the Enterprise, but her Juvenile Son Wesley remained on board. Dr Crusher was replaced for this season only by Dr. Kate Polasky played by Diana Muldaur. An entirely fine character, played by a perfectly good actress, that just feels terribly out of place.    The screenwriting and special effects in this season are maturing, as are the characters somewhat. We find Geordi LaForge promoted to the title of Chief Engineer, and the appearance of Whoopi Goldberg's character Guinan.     As a collector, and enthusiast in all things Trek this is a must have box set. But don't expect it to be the same quality writing, acting, effects, or characters as later seasons. But it is obvious they were getting their act together here.
0060594896|5.0|I love this book.  It has all the right tips for finding success in everything you do.  As a business mentor for health and wellness practitioners, I have found this to be a top recommended read for people who are ready to take their business to the next level.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I had the DVD version of Band of Brothers since it was first released. I didn't miss an episode during its run on HBO. This series is loaded with quality acting. Damien Lewis (now of NBCs Life) was brilliant and one of my favorite characters in all of Band of Brothers was amazingly acted by Donnie Wahlberg of New Kids on the Block fame and The Sixth Sense.  As soon as the Bluray version of BOB came out, I just gave away the DVD edition to a friend of mine.  The video quality is so sharp and the black levels are so bold. It also fills your widescreen TV perfectly in HD. No black bars! Buy this set now!
B001P3SA94|5.0|Even though they played around with historical facts and figures,   I still found this movie to be very entertaining and all the   cast did a good job in their respective parts.   This is about how Leonard Chess (a 2nd generation polish-american jew)  and his brother Phil founded the very influential CHESS label   in the late 40's and early 50's and gave the black music   that had come up from the south with the great migration a voice   and a new electric aggressive amplified sound that became known   as the Chicago Blues!  Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, John Lee Hooker,   Chuck Berry, Etta James, Koko Taylor and early gospel artists   like a very young Aretha Franklin and her father, the very   influential Reverend C.L. Franklin all found a home at Chess   and their art was heard all over America and beyond to England   where people like Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger,   Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck, Eric Burdon, John Lennon,   Paul Macartney, George Harrison and many many others were   inspired to create a british rock revolution that changed   pop & rock music forever!  Chess Records was pre-SUN, pre-STAX and pre-Motown!  Its only contemporary would be Atlantic Records.  The real story is far more tumultuous and interesting than   this movie could ever be, but then it would've been a 3 hour flick.  I would definitely add it to my collection for the history and   for rememberance of the label that was a fixture in most   music loving households from the late 40's to the late 60's   when Leonard Chess sold it and died soon after from a massive   heart attack only a few blocks from the site where   his musical empire once stood!
B000FSME1A|4.0|It is nice to have both versions of the films in one place in such cool-looking packaging.  The extras are good and worth at least one viewing.  I enjoyed hearing how the version of The End used at the film's  opening was something that the sound team discovered while going through the Door's archived recordings.  Admittedly, it could have used the addition of the Heart of Darkness documentary, and maybe they should have put one version on one disc and the second version on the other disc. But, overall, it's not a bad deal at all.
1400077915|5.0|I can think of no better short story writer than Alice Munro.<br />She is able to evoke a whole world with few words. Without<br />spoiling any of the stories or their outcomes here are some<br />of the ideas on which the stories are based.<br /><br />In this collection I especially liked the title story 'Runaway'.<br />An abused woman seeks refuge with her neighbor, an enlightened<br />woman who tries to help her. As in most cases of domestic violence<br />things do not turn out as neatly as one might predict.<br /><br />I enjoyed the trilogy about a woman whose daughter joins a cult.<br /><br />My favorite story in the collection is a poignant and tragic story<br />about how a case of mistaken identity causes  a love to be lost for<br />a lifetime.  This story is so powerful that I felt like I was<br />viscerally blindsided while reading it.<br /><br />One of the stronger stories is about a woman who has an impulsive<br />affair with an alcoholic doctor.<br /><br />I savor Ms. Munro's work and have learned not to predict or expect<br />what will happen next.<br /><br />I give this book my highest recommendation.

Everyone needs to buy this video.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|What was the secret?  Why did Paul Giammati and Laura Linney spend so much time whispering?  And why did they spend so much time having discussions in bed?  Maybe because the series was boring.  Like their acting.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|If you are a believer and you can understand one simple message, you will love this film...that is......Jesus died for our sins. Imagine if all of the worlds sins entered into one man. How gruesome do you think that would be? That is what I took from the movie. Jesus suffered for US. Jesus died for US and he endured OUR pain, OUR suffering and OUR sins, so that WE can be saved. If you did not like the movie and you believe Jesus is the son of God, watch it again. Imagine Jesus going through this pain for YOU. It is a very powerful message. I am not sure if that was what Mel Gibson's was trying to portray, but that is what I got out of it and I loved it. However, I agree.........not for children.

Thank you Jason! Your songs bring a huge smile to my face!
0061139378|3.0|fyi there is a little spoiler in this review    So, I took my daughter to see the movie cause my girlfriend LOVED the book.  I thought the movie was great and I have enjoyed other books by Neil Gaiman, so I picked up the book.  I love love love to read so I was excited.  Unfortunately I was disappointed. Though it wans't terrible, I feel like the story just wasn't whole.  I feel like the movie added all that was missing from the book.  I found the book a bit hard to read and had to put it down at one point.  I stopped reading it when Coraline goes back home after being in the alternate house to find her parents gone.  She goes on about life saying things like \\"I guess I'm a one child household now\\" or something to that effect.  I found that strange and unbelievable.  Even if your life and parents are boring, I would think that finding them missing would be at least slightly alarming.  Overall it just didn't flow well for me and I didn't find it believable.  The movie however was great!
B00064X3BI|5.0|Excellent SACD, at the same level as Roxy Music's \\"Avalon\\",Pink Floyd's \\"DSOTM\\", Dire Straits \\"Brothers in Arms\\".<br />Grrrrrrrreat bass depth (LFE), space and definition. The bass in this one is the best i've heard on SACD, the sound of the guitar is superb (as if Eric Clapton was playing with an amp next to you).<br /><br />It's a shame SACD never took off.<br /><br />Anyone having a PS3 with SACD capabilities and with love of music in general should have at last all the discs i've mentioned in this review (IMHO of course).<br /><br />By the way, i bought my first SACD just by curiosity to try my PS3 capabilities (2 years ago), now i am the proud owner of 50 titles in SACD and 10 in DVD-Audio, also bought an Oppo DVD player (980) because i don't wanna wear out my PS3.<br /><br />Support SACD please (and enjoy the finest in sound quality)&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;&iexcl;
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The vampire genre has been done to death so many times that finding something new and exciting about it often feels like fighting a losing battle.  That's why we should be thankful for Let the Right One In, a Swedish import that puts a thoughtful, haunting, and surprisingly touching stamp on vampire lore.  The film revolves around Oskar (Kåre Hedebrant), a twelve year old who is constantly bullied and yearns for revenge against his tormenters.  He comes across a girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who over time he learns to be a vampire, and with whom he finds both love and a method of vengeance.  If it sounds like Twilight to you at all, just ignore that thought.  Let the Right One In can be considered what an adult take on Twilight could be, with brilliant performances, a dark and poetic tone, and an actually thought provoking screenplay.  Tomas Alfredson's direction is hypnotic as well, luring the viewer into this world that also manages to provide a good amount of shocks as well.  Rumor has it that this film is being fast-tracked to be remade for American audiences.  If that is the case (which I certainly hope it isn't) then it is also all the more reason that you should check out Let the Right One In.  It is a brilliant, thought provoking film that soars well above its genre, and it deserves your time and attention.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a modern day classic.

B001LPWGE6|5.0|I've been waiting for Universal to release these 3 films ever since HD-DVD went bye bye. Alas, I was not disappointed, although I was fearful that Universal would pull the same stunt they did with the regular DVD versions of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum in which they omitted the DTS soundtracks (The Bourne Identity had both Dolby 5.1 and DTS). But the studio did not disappoint, and all 3 discs have DTS -- PLUS -- amazingly improved video transfers when compared to the original DVD versions. These movies look fabulous, even on my 1080i plasma set. I can just imagine their clarity on a 1080p monitor. If you liked these movies in the theater, BUY this set. Well worth the money.

B001QB9H1A|3.0|The first Transporter flick was a bona-fide guilty pleasure, but already by the second installment, the series felt as if it was already running on empty.  Well, Transporter 3 is a slight improvement, as Jason Statham returns as driver extraordinaire Frank Martin.  This time around, Frank is forced into driving a kidnapped girl (Natalya Rudakova) by a mysterious man named Johnson (Prison Break's Robert Knepper).  The catch is that both she and Frank have electronic bracelets stuck on them that will explode if either leaves a certain distance from Frank's car.  Yeah, Statham's other action franchise Crank kind of comes to mind here a little bit in terms of the plot, but for the most part, Transporter 3 delivers the action goods, which is a good thing considering that the script and dialogue are pretty lousy and we have to contend with the pretty and annoying Rudakova.  Statham however still manages to be instantly likeable and imposing, and Francois Berleand returns as Inspector Tarconi to lend some comic relief as well, and the closing action sequences are worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, if you enjoyed either of the previous Transporter films, chances are you'll enjoy what Transporter 3 has to offer.  If you didn't, well, you won't be converted to say the least.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Okay, first and foremost, I am a woman writing this review (HAHAHA!).  I chose the title because my husband decided to try it out with me when I was still at Level one and, although he is in awesome shape, he couldn't get all the way through.  His exact words were, \\"Okay, she wins!\\", and he sat down.  But the great thing about it is that I think it hurt his ego a little bit and he came back the next day to redeem himself.  This workout is awesome! I am still on Level Two, but I still get a great workout as I push myself a little harder each day.  I have also read the other reviews that said to jump around in the levels to stave off boredom, so I am definitely game to try that.  Anyway, you know that you are getting a good workout when you are yelling at Jillian on the television, and for my husband who is a fitness junkie, you know it works when he's sweating like he's worked out for an hour.....and it's only 20 minutes!  YAY to Jillian!!!
031606792X|5.0|Stephanie Meyers is a brilliant writer. I have read all 4 books. I wasn't going to, but once I started I could not stop. I talked about it to everyone I saw. People who had already read the books would not comment for fear that they would give something away. My kids even read it and then went to the movie.    Emails come to me still from people I have talked into reading the book. My one friend, borrowed the books from friends and the library only to purchase them anyway.      Well, I am hoping Stephanie reads this, I do not believe that this saga has to end. I mean, Bella is just beginning to discover her secret powers. Nessie is becoming her own and will grow hopefully just like that other 1/2 moral boy that Alice brought to the meeting, and the Volturi, like Edward said will probably want to retaliate. Man, this could go on. Everyone should just enjoy these wonderful books and give her some space so that her talents can brew up some more wonderful adventures of the Cullen family, with all the rest of their friends. THANK YOU so much Stephanie Meyers for your wonderful imagination and the ability to put it into words for the rest of the world to read.
B000062Y98|5.0|This is one of the best CD's ever.  It combines powerful electric guitar solos and a full orchestra on almost every song, along with the beautiful, strong voice of Hansi Kursch, often overlapped several times to produce a choral sound.  And of course the fact that it includes the most epic song of all time, And Then There was Silence, helps a lot.

As most of the NG offerings it owns that dark mood everywhere plus is fast and fun.     Sorry for being minimalistic, but there is nothing different to say from what thousands and thousands of Neil Gaiman´s fans around the world may have already said.     Coraline it´s BRILLIANT and a must have in your personal book collection.    Cheers!!!!

B001MYIXAC|5.0|\\"Let the Right One In\\" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.<br /><br />I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was \\"hypnotic\\" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow abounding all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself as Eli's protector.<br /><br />The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire \\"I must be gone and live, or stay and die\\" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.never in an over the top manner.

B001UOVP1S|5.0|This album feels quite experimental, given the departure from the musical style of previous Cornell albums--but that's not to say it isn't polished, well thought-out, and very listenable (not attributes for your typical 'experimental' album).<br /><br />While I was very apprehensive after hearing a couple of the early singles, I ended up really loving this album. It all flows together from beginning to end, with song breaks rarely even noticeable.<br /><br />Timbaland actually produces some really interesting soundscapes that complement Chris' voice more than I expected. I don't think this album will necesarily appeal to strict Soundgarden fans, but there is a lot to like here if you're willing to try something a little different.
1577312082|4.0|This book is not for folks who consider themselves too brilliant to learn anything new...   It's definitely not for those who live based on past performance or results.  For myself, it was the best thing I could find when I found it.   Reading it, was the most therapeutic exercise I've ever had in learning to deal with circumstances that are outside of one's control, and finding moments of happiness and peace again.   RI_Maam

0140277447|1.0|First of all, let me say that I firmly believe a massacre took place in Nanking in 1937. There is no doubt that the Japanese military slaughtered thousands of Chinese civilians in and around the city once they were in control.<br /><br />My problem with this book is that it is so full of biased innacuracy that it actually gives credibility to the revisionist arguement that the massacre was made up. Chang had a cliched opinion of the Japanese character and her research was sloppy at best. At worst she resorted to outright fabrication.<br /><br />The victims deserve better treatment than this, and anyone who endorses this book has obviously never done serious research on this issue.
1587613379|5.0|I have always loved sex, but growing up in the South, felt a bit guilty about that.  Even though I had open-minded parents, the society around me shaped my beliefs more than I often like to admit.    I found this book very helpful as it showed me that I am not the only one to feel as I do about sex and, more importantly, that I'm not a \\"bad\\" person for feeling this way.      Whether or not you are interested in having more sex, or justifying the sex you already have, this book will help you to work with the mental issues around that.      Being an \\"ethical slut\\" is about much more than sex though-- it's about having the courage to express your feelings and following your desires.  It's about expanding yourself to new levels and going way beyond the limits society has set for you.    Of course, that is my definition.  One of the great things about this book is that it allows you to define \\"ethical slut\\" for yourself.  The authors throw it all out there.  Bisexuality, multiple partners are once, marriage, leather, bondage, and more is included here.  You pick what works for you.  You're also free to change that at any time.    Good book.  Very progressive and certainly not for everybody.  The book encourages you to follow your own road though, so if you read it, do so knowing that it's perfectly ok for you to disagree.    A related book, which I also love, and I think you will also, is [[ASIN:0981803989 Just Fk Me! - What Women Want Men to Know About Taking Control in the Bedroom]].  Something else to make you question everything and come up with your own thoughts.

1416955070|3.0|I think my quirky best friend (ripping off P.E) said it best. \\"If Harry Potter and Star Wars had a baby and then that baby married Buffy and they had baby...this is what you'd get.\\"    Is it original? Not really. Is it funny? It has its moments. Is it enjoyable? To me, yes. Is it creative? In it's way, but nothing we haven't seen before.    In the times when best selling novels are nothing more than Mary Sue fan fiction (Twilight, anyone?) It's not surprising this series is popular.     I'm not going to go in to great detail since there is already a ton of very informative reviews on this site. I just wanted to reinforce what has already been said....    If you're an avid reader there is probably nothing in the Mortal Instruments series that you haven't seen before. However, if you're just looking for a fun fantasy/supernatural read then you won't be disappointed. But if you are looking for something more original and groundbreaking, you should look elsewhere.
B0014CQNTK|3.0|Don't get me wrong, this is a good little movie - emphasis on \\"little.\\"  If I'd seen it on Lifetime Movie Network, I might say it was better than average. But a 2007 Oscar nominee for Best Picture? You've got to be kidding! I would be far more forgiving of Juno's flaws had I not been subjected to the overblown hype surrounding this movie.  Now I feel obligated to knock it down a few notches.  How it got nominated over much more deserving films (like Sean Penn's \\"Into the Wild\\") is a testament to the genius of the marketing and PR folks.<br /><br />Juno (Ellen Page) is a sarcastic, precocious 16-year-old who graciously humors the clueless adults in her life. She finds herself accidentally pregnant by a friend (Michael Sera) she seduces for apparently for no other reason than idle curiosity.  If she's as smart and mature as we're supposed to believe she is, how come she's never heard of birth control?  And why aren't her parents upset?  The dialogue is reminiscent of a sit-com: rapid-fire, oh-so-witty, full of hip pop-culture references... in other words, totally unbelievable.  In one scene Juno name-drops Soupy Sales, yet in another reveals she has never heard of Bob Marley.  Oh please! The exchanges between Juno and her best friend are particularly unrealistic and annoying. I wonder how many real teenage girls crack one-liners during the \\"Oh my god I'm pregnant!\\" conversation.  The most believable character is Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), the would-be adoptive mom.  There are shades of gray in her portrayal, and thankfully, she did not have to read lines of dialogue that sound sound like they belong on 30 Rock.<br /><br />Juno is amusing enough though, to keep the viewer entertained till the end.  But that is the extent of it's value.  The outcome is predictable, the relationships all tidied up in a feel-good way, and the teachable moments, though lacking preachyness, are clichéd.  Rent the movie to fill an idle afternoon, but don't go out of your way to see it.  Better yet, see \\"Into the Wild\\" instead.  Now that's movie-making!
B001FBSMF8|1.0|What is going on with this album? The music sounds like a Justin Timberlake album. The lyrics rhyme, but my alphabet cereal could have written more meaningful ones.    If this was the first album Chris Cornell ever put out, if he hadn't been so successful in the past, if we didn't know he was capable of such great things, then this album wouldn't be so disappointing.    Unless clubs and radio start playing one of these songs over and over, like they do so many other songs, this album will largely be ignored. As a Chris Cornell fan, I will employ selective amnesia and forget this album exists.    Does anyone know when Chris Cornell plans to release a new album? I can't wait!

Though I remembered he book generally, over time I had forgotten some of the details which made the book fresh again.<br /><br />I do not recall what the last version was that I read, but I enjoyed this translation.  From the moment we meet Josef K we are part of his nightmare and the absurd life around him.<br /><br />In the end the book was just as dark, confusing and thought provoking as I remember thinking it was when I first read it, which is why it became one of my favorite books.
B001UOVP1S|5.0|as soon as all you nay-sayers remember that you'll find your appreciation for Chris Cornell's music.  His solo work has always been different and heart-felt than his ensemble work. I think it takes a lot of balls to team up with Timbaland and I find it more interesting and creative Audioslave.  As much as I like CC's music, lyrics and style he shouldn't have teamed up with Rage.  They just weren't compatible.  They had a few good songs, but as soon as Tom Morello learns how to keep within the key signature of the song he'll be a much better player.  So I am going to support Chris and buy his album!
3551354014|4.0|I was approaching fluency in German as far as conversation goes, but was still hopeless to read narrative German.  This book was a great starting point for learning many of the strong verb forms that are almost impossible to memorize using rote methods.  My heart sank when I first opened it up and it was very difficult to get through every page.  After just a few chapters though I had learned about twenty of the most important strong verbs, and was able to read through the book with reasonable speed.  By the last few chapters I'd learned about fifty of them and was reading the book very briskly.  This is a great start to learning narrative German, as long as you're dedicated and know the story well enough to continue to follow it when you run into those rough spots where you just plain can't figure the words out.    It's also a high-quality product.  The pages of the book are very thick and durable.  Its also bound in such a way that after its been in use for a while, although it will have unsightly creases on the spine, it lies flat open on a table, which I find very useful.    There are, however, a few translation errors that even an intermediate/advanced student was able to notice(such as using \\"welch\\" as a relative pronoun), and a lot of the vocabulary relating to magical items won't be at all useful in everyday life.      Overall this was a great purchase and it's a shame Amazon doesn't have the other volumes in the series available for regular purchase as they do with this one.
B0002G2B2M|1.0|This movie is about two losers trying to find love and meaning in life between their loser lives. Obviously, a hopeless cause. I have never seen a worse, more stupid movie in my life. I would give it zero stars if I could.

B000002KAT|5.0|Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks\\" sounds like the ultimate musical jam session: a unique blend of jazz, folk, and blues that feels totally natural and effortless in its delivery, making the album endlessly listenable.  His nostalgic lyrics about his childhood in Ireland are nothing less than stunning, the writings of a man who has seen crushing and heart-breaking tragedy -- but also a man who knows of a warm, healing, nearly inexpressible joy.  This album's deeply poetic words, disarmingly soulful singing, gently shimmering music, and life-affirming vibe, is like medicine for the soul, to the point where I can see God himself saving someone's life through this music if a despairing person receives this album as a gift and then listens to it.

Gee, you dolts who gave it one star and complain that it is not Soundgarden are just ignorant.     Just because someone steps outside their \\"formula\\" does not make it a bad effort. In fact, this is a great collection of songs, very diverse and well produced. Sure it is not typical Chris but that is not a bad thing. Embrace something new, put on the old Temple of the Dog CD when you are feeling like a little grunge. I am a hard rock fan at heart, but I still find this a solid CD!    I normally do not write reviews but the ignorance I have read here prompted me. Nice job Chris.

B0018QOIXU|4.0|I purchased the Adele CD because so many people compared her to Amy Winehouse and after her performance on the Award show (can't remember which but she sang with the lady from Sugarland), I was curious. I am pleased enough with the purchase although the comparison was way off.<br /><br />Adele has a sound very much like that of R&B artist Chrisette Michelle just not as powerful. I have to say that I absolutely love track 3, Chasing Pavement and a close second for me is track 9, Make You Feel My Love..... Adele's got talent for sure so I hope she sticks around long enough to be able to hear her music mature some.

B00000I14Z|5.0|I am not a professional reviewer, and I don't want to be redundant given the fine reviews that are already available, so I will share what is hopefully a slightly different perspective with you if you are looking for a reason to pull the trigger and purchase this recording.    In years past, I was of the (ignorant) opinion that Mingus's music was not very accessible, because I had heard that from others here and there who were \\"into jazz.\\" Which brings up a point - when people tell you that, it's always a good idea to get a barometer on what kind of jazz they listen to, as jazz music is the most segmented genre in the world of music.  As I have grown older (now 47), and having grown up in a household where my Dad played lots of big band jazz and some classical, in my adult life I have centered upon bebop as my favorite genre.  It all started when a friend turned me onto some Jazz Messengers recordings and I was hooked. I am a percussionist at heart, so I love the energy of the faster tempos, the tight harmonics, the horns, and the fact that bebop is acoustic, which gives it lots of purity in my mind, as it requires the musicians to really hone their craft, and last but not least, that it typically swings.      Now that I have said that, I will say this:  Ah Um is at its minimum, a truly outstanding jazz recording in the bebop genre.  There is a diversity of tempos, although most of the tunes have a traditional fast tempo that is associated with bebop.  There are some blues-driven tunes (the famous and somewhat somber \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\"), but most of this stuff SWINGS! (Go right to \\"Bird Call\\" if you need confirmation.) \\"Boogie Stop Shuffle,\\" whose base melody humorously reminds me of the theme from Spiderman (!) is one of my favorites.  And the gorgeous balladry of \\"Self-Portrait in Three Colors\\" is a tune that I am fairly certain influenced Wynton Marsalis' J Mood recording, as well as compostions from other artists I am sure.  The playful, bluesy, and sexy horn (clarinet, sax, trombone) work on \\"Pussy Cat Dues\\" is not to be missed, and just try to listen to \\"Jelly Roll\\" without grinning! Overall, the recording seems to alternate between tempos which is yet another factor that makes it interesting and will bring you back again and again.  And all of the musicians are in top form.     In conclusion, I have to say that this is some of the richest bebop I have ever heard - the at times lyrical unison of the horns, the intermittent swinging, and Mingus' driving yet tastefully subdued bass lines that never intrude.  Ah Um, while innovative, is still one of the more accessible bebop recordings and is essential if in fact you enjoy the genre.  Take it from me, a late comer. After listening even once, the sweeping influence this recording has rendered is now very apparent to me. And that has been a fun discovery!

B001FBSMF8|4.0|Wow, that was different, huh?<br /><br />I'm hugely admiring of Cornell as a singer, songwriter, and musician. He's done some fantastic things in his career and some not-so-fantastic things, but of his generation, he's certainly in the upper echelon.<br /><br />So I felt equal measures trepidation and curiosity when I first heard about this project, as well as a good dose of confusion. An album with Timbaland - what the hell? I was aware of Timbaland's reputation as a producer and hitmaker, although that's not my genre of music, so I wasn't too familiar with his actual work. In fact, a lot of the stuff he's done in the past is stuff that I skip over when I'm changing stations, without listening to it, because I assumed (rightly or wrongly) that his genre of music wouldn't say anything to me. But what I *did* become very familiar with was the bitter, venomous reaction that the project was eliciting from some of Cornell's fans online - and to be honest, that made me even more interested in hearing the album.<br /><br />So I bought it yesterday and have given it a couple of spins, and its not bad. Way different, absolutely, but not bad. Some of it I dig (I think \\"Long Gone\\" in particular is terrific), and some of it I don't care too much for. Obviously its a complete departure from the rest of the Cornell catalogue, which I realize makes a lot of people very uptight. The reaction of white male rocks fans to their heroes delving into areas they consider too black (R&B) and/or too gay (dance music) often betrays a lot of otherwise unexpressed racism and homophobia, and I think that shows in some of the the vicious response to this record. Reading some of these reviews, for example, you'd think this album was a crime that ranked somewhere between the cancellation of the original Star Trek and the crucifiction of Christ. Way over the top there, folks. As a wise man once said, its only a bloody record.<br /><br />Cornell must have known that was in the offing, but he did it anyway, and I have to respect that. Its so easy for somebody of Cornell's stature and reputation to stay in his box, play it safe, and turn out the same album every couple of years for the rest of his life. Bands like KISS and AC/DC and Metallica have had long successful careers doing pretty much exactly that, and there's a loyal audience that comes back for the same thing year in and year out. And more power to those folks if it works for them. But for Cornell to so leap outside his comfort zone and to take such a risk, both artistically and commercially, well ... like I said, the man's got balls. Love or hate the album, you have to give him that. And as it will probably be a flop, you folks who hate it can always wait a couple of years for him to make the inevitable \\"return to form\\" record that will allow you to wag your fingers and say \\"I told you so\\" - easily the four most satisfying words in the English language.<br /><br />Until then, \\"Scream\\" is the one work in Cornell's catalogue that will cause his fans to \\"make a little love, make a little war\\" because it is obviously not for everybody.hat.
