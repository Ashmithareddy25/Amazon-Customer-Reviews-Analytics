B0000542D2|5.0|... You have to love the Beatles . ...<br />The movie is filmed in black and white, because that's what they had in those days. Those of you who remember the true early days of the Beatles will have already bought this movie. Those of you who are new to the genre, should take the chance. Remember, this movie is a comedy!!<br />Most of the movie is about Ringo being manipulated by Paul's grandfather (a `mixer' i.e. troublemaker), and the way the lads were manipulated by the press. The ultimate plot is their escaping from the presshounds.<br />And the script was purposely written very loosely, allowing for the Beatles to completely adlib the movie. There are off cheek remarks, cockney slang, and the fab Four themselves just running amok prior, during, and after the `tv spot' exposure they found themselves trapped within.<br />this is not `Help', which was a complete romp, but a sarcastic comment on the exploitation of rock stars.<br />Again, this film is A COMEDY! Go with it!! True Beatle fans will own this DVD the day it comes out. They will sing along with it, and dance in front of their televisons while the DVD hums happily. The rest of you will be lucky if it ever shows up on cable, EVER, and curse yourselves when you find out it is hard to find.
B00003CX8Y|3.0|Does anyone else find it disturbing that the \\"beautiful\\" witch turned a little boy (albeit selfish) into a monster? If you'll listen to the song \\"Be Our Guest\\", you will find out that they've been rusting in the castle for ten years. And considering that the magical rose withers completely on his 21st birthday, I find it unbelievable that anyone could justify the actions of the beautiful witch....who had nothing better to do with her time than pick on an 11 year old boy.
B00000811N|5.0|And it was Ron Geesin who put him there.  I'm always disappointed when I hear a Floyd fan rag on this album.  It's one of my favorite records of all time, easily beating out ALL of the Floyd material from around this time.  After Syd, the Floyd got boring until Meddle.  Somewhere around Ummagumma, Waters started hanging around Scottish experimental composer and all-around eccentric Ron Geesin.  This album is billed as a collaborative effort, but it's pretty evenly split between Waters' morbid lullabyes and Geesin's outrageous compositions for body parts, string quartet, guitar and tape loop, spoken word... Do you like &quot;Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict&quot;?  You'll swear Roger swiped that track wholesale from Geesin after hearing this record.  But the record is enjoyable for more than 'being weird'.  There are beautiful compositions sprinkled throughout, and even the soppy Roger &quot;Did I tell you my dad died in the war?&quot; Waters tunes are pleasant enough.  Please, everyone, give this record a chance!  Listen to it as an artifact completely detatched from Pink Floyd.  It takes chances that few records take, and it rewards repeated listens.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon stars in this hilarious movie, LEGALLY BLONDE. She plays Elle Woods, a sorority girl who is determined to get into Harvard Law after her boyfriend tells her she isn't smart enough for him. While it's a cliche plot, it's also very humorous as it pokes fun at itself. The tale is enriched by supporting characters and a well rounded story. Reese Witherspoon's comic timing is excellent, and its impossible not to enjoy her performance here. Elle eventually enters an internship, with her ex boyfriend and his current beau, and they have to defend Brooke, a woman who Elle knew through her sorority. Elle is the only one who belives her innocence and later goes onto to prove her innocence, taking on the case when Callahan her professor makes a move on her, and Brooke dumps him. Its a well timed comedy movie, with some great moments all around. Other actors include Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, and more. The movie has an underlying message for the underdog, no one thought Elle could be a success but she went above and beyond the expecation and did it even though no one thought she could. A must see movie.

B00006F7S4|5.0|The most beautiful Beck album to date, by far!
B000067CQK|5.0|Well, Ziggy's back, sounding better than ever.  The disc sounds really crisp and full-bodied, so kudos on that.  The 2nd disc is full of rarities, none too revelatory, but including the well-loved &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; and alternate versions some Ziggy tracks.  <br />The really nice thing about this disc is the lovely booklet, full of excellent photos and a fawning but informative essay, a timeline, and quotes from famous Ziggy acolytes.  The only disappointing thing is the complete lack of lyrics.  <br />Still, it's a very handsome edition of this classic album.  And its nice to listen to the album and not to have to rush to the CD player before the bonus tracks begin.  <br />So gimme your hands!
1572702516|5.0|I read this book in class and it is such a wonderfully thrilling story. It will keep you on your toes all the time... I couldn't put it down.. I recomend you should read this book if you love thrilling and mysterious murder stories.
B000002MUN|5.0|Great Music,great production,fantastic players. But listen to the words. This album is all about TP's breakup with his wife and all the trials and tribulations that go with it. Every time I listen to this album, it gets better and more personal. This is a classic.
B000002LOE|4.0|I've got something to say that's gonna anger a lot of people, but here goes...After Out of Time, R.E.M. jumped the shark. It's as simple as that. Before you raise your voice in anger, just hear me out.<br />Up through Out of Time, R.E.M. were an innovative and important band that actually lived up to the hype. Their first mistake was the critically-acclaimed follow-up to Out of Time, Automatic for the People, a collection of schmaltzy ballads including \\"Everybody Hurts\\", \\"Man on the Moon\\", and the hipster anthem \\"Nightswimming\\". I'm sure you've got at least one trendy friend who's told you before that \\"'Nightswimming' totally speaks to them. The lyrics are so deep.\\" Whatever. <br />So, Automatic for the People was a major disappointment to me, but one bad album wasn't going to deter me - not after the decade of classics that came before it. Where R.E.M. really alienated me, however, was with the release of their next album, 1994's Monster. Nirvana and Pearl Jam were topping the charts and R.E.M., apparently determined to maintain their recent mainstream popularity, went ahead and made a terrible pseudo-grunge album. I tried to like it, I really did. But R.E.M. were supposed to sound like they came from Athens, not Seattle. After Monster, the release of a new R.E.M. album was no longer an event for me. Sure, I'd end up with a copy eventually (except for Reveal which I still don't own), but I was in no hurry to procure one.<br />Yup, R.E.M. jumped the shark after Out of Time and nothing you say will convince me otherwise. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's consider Out of Time itself. What about it makes it the last essential R.E.M. album? It begins pleasantly enough with the Michael Stipe/KRS-One duet \\"Radio Song\\" which always struck me as a bit contrived but plenty enjoyable. With the second song, the mega radio and video hit \\"Losing My Religion\\", R.E.M. bring out the big guns. No matter how often you hear it, it still sounds brilliant - when Michael Stipe is feeling a song, there might not be a better rock singer out there - and Stipe was definitely feeling \\"Losing My Religion\\". And the final four songs on this album provide an exceptional closing sequence that culminate in arguably the best song on the album, \\"Me In Honey\\". After their schlocky duet on \\"Shiny Happy People\\", Michael Stipe and Kate Pierson more than redeem themselves with their glorious vocal harmonies on this final track. Speaking of schlock, a word of warning - there's more than one unlistenable song on here. Unless you're the kind of person who likes to spend their Sunday afternoons listening to molasses drip, I advise you to avoid \\"Low\\" and \\"Endgame\\" at all costs. I said this is an essential R.E.M. album, not a perfect one.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Incredible.  The chronological order of the playlist is interesting, too. There is a substantial difference between Elvis' pre- and post-army stint which renders the entire collection a sort of before-and-after aura.  That said, the collection is astonishing.  The inclusion of 'His Latest Flame' makes it worthwhile in itself, and the hilarious 'Return To Sender' remains a hoot.  And if the BPM version of 'A Little Less Conversation' smacks of into-the-new-century exploitation, well, Elvis probably would have wanted it that way.  In any case it's awesome.  The sound is excellent and the remixes don't detract from the original versions one iota; in fact in most cases they intensify what was already great to begin with (a rare occurence elsewhere).  Detractors, of whom there will be many, might argue that this is all overkill- -do we need yet another Elvis collection?  Maybe not, and they probably don't want to like Elvis anyway.  But this isn't really for us or them.  Like it or not, Elvis is into the next generation and the world can only be better for it.  He was, and is, one of the few greats.  Big hunk 'o burnin' love.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I read the book \\"About a Boy\\" over a year ago, and found it mildly entertaining.  Then my best friend needed someone to see the movie with while her husband watched \\"Attack of the Clones\\" and I was lucky enough to be her only friend without plans.  Man, am I ever glad I didn't have plans.  This movie is hilarious, and if you've read the book before seeing the movie, read it again afterwards.  This is the only case I've ever encountered of a movie actually making the book more entertaining.  The few tweaks made in the film adaptation fit perfectly, and it is obvious that the filmmakers didn't add or subtract anything that wasn't absolutely necessary.  Altogether, this is one of the finest films I've seen in my scant 22 years.
B00006IU73|5.0|I know some of you fans out there thought that with PT's signing to a major label (Lava/Atlantic) that they would be selling out.  You couldn't be more wrong.  On this CD, Porcupine Tree is being true to themselves... it is a continuation of past recordings, following a logical progression or keeping the best while trying some new...  For old fans, there is Definitely some &quot;Signify&quot; and even &quot;Sunday&quot; (The Creator has a Master Tape fits in this category to me) stuff here... For me, the strongest songs are &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot;, &quot;Trains&quot;, &quot;Sound of Muzak&quot;, &quot;Gravity Eyelids&quot;, and &quot;Heart Attack&quot;.  The instrumental (Wedding Nails) is also quite good.. nice to hear the band stretch out like this... New Drummer Gavin Harrison is amazing - turning up the drumming a notch from the also amazing Chris Maitland.  Like others have said, this CD is a bit heavier than previous outings, but it's a welcome change... Listen to this all the way through for the best effect - the playing order and the way the songs blend work perfectly when played in its entirety.  Listen, enjoy, be amazed and have fun!  Then, if you don't have them already, pick yourself up off the floor and go out and buy the rest of their CDs!
0671799320|5.0|...then you really want to know about this book.  OK, I'll give it to you straight. It is the most fascinating, interesting, and riveting non-fictional book I have ever read, and I read a lot.<br />The Prize reads like a thriller, but is educating you like a semester in a Power, Politics, and Modern Money History class at Harvard.  Go ahead and buy it.  You'll reconsider your plan to read all that melodramatic fiction on your bookshelves.  Believe me.
B00005YUNY|4.0|This DVD sounds great, it's very clean and it has a great playlist. One problem; it's over edited. This reminds me of the Peter Gabriel concert video &quot;Secret World Live&quot;. Another example of an excellent concert that could easily stand on it's own feet without a lot of fancy editing. I find it very destracting when the camera doesn't stay on one thing for more than just a few seconds. In that respect, I found Keys to be far more enjoyable. A good example of a director who understands that a good concert doesn't need a lot of editing would be Anton Corbijn who directed the Depeche Mode concert video &quot;Devotional&quot;. A good concert video should try to recreate the feeling of being at the concert. Symphonic Live failed to do that. Still, the sound and music is so good that it compensates for the aweful editing.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Knopfler, the Dire Straits frontman has released one of the freshest discs of the year. It's top knotch song writing and music at its best.<BR>Knopfler has a knack of combining great storytelling and fine music together.<BR>Each song on this disc has a folk-country feel to them. Each telling a different tale of life of the working class. <BR>The disc starts out with &quot;Why Aye Man&quot; a toe tapping tune that's very reminiscent of a Dire Straits song. It tells the story of men who travel to Germany to find work because jobs are scarce in their native countries. &quot;Hill Farmer's Blues&quot;, &quot;Quality Shoe&quot; and most of the tracks on this disc are odes to the working class.<BR>Mixed with Knopfler's fine guitar playing and distinctive voice this cd is well worth a listen. Give it a listen!
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first heard that Joss Whedon was making a musical episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, I was excited yet nervous wondering if it was going to be good or not. So on Thursday 14th February 2002, I sat down and watched Once More, With Feeling on SKY One and witnessed one of the greatest hours of TV I have ever seen in my whole life! The episode was first broadcast on Tuesday November 6th 2001 in the US and was adored by critics and fans alike - they called it \\"the greatest Buffy episode ever\\", \\"A classic in TV history\\" and \\"thoroughly enjoyable - there isn't anyway Buffy can get any better.\\"<br />I thought it was inevitable that a soundtrack to Once More, With Feeling would be released as the episode was such a hit. The album contains a worthy 19 tracks from the episode and an extra 4 songs from other classic Buffy episodes written and directed by Joss Whedon such as The Gift, Hush and Restless. There are some amazing songs on here such as Going Through The Motions sung entirely by Buffy as she's out in the cemetery doing the usual - slaying the vamps. She manages to kill the demons and slay the vampires while singing away to her heart's content! Another highlight is I'll Never Tell. Xander and Anya are waking up one morning and just burst out into song! They dance and sing their way around the kitchen and dining room while climbing onto tables and \\"dancing crazy!\\" Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield give surprisingly good vocal performances as the two love birds. But the absolute highlight of this episode turns out to be I'm Under Your Spell. Willow and Tara are walking along merrily in a park as Tara burst out into song. Amber Benson is fantastic as Tara and has a phenomenal voice! Who would've guessed that the stars of Buffy could sing better than most full-time singers, even though they're full-time actors?! Tara's lyrics turn out to be true in more ways than one - in the previous episode, Willow put Tara under a spell to make her stop going on about how Willow is using too much magic. Even on a light tone, the episode manages to set the dark tone for the remainder of the season.<br />There isn't much singing from Willow, however. Alyson Hannigan admitted to Joss Whedon she was a terrible singer and didn't want people to hear her voice. She only has small parts on songs such as Walk Through The Fire and I've Got A Theory/If We're Together. Rest In Peace is sung by Spike. James Marsters also has a rather impressive voice. Buffy visits his crypt to see if he knows anything about why everyone is Sunnydale keeps bursting out into song when he bursts out into song himself! Buffy just rolls her eyes waiting for it to end. \\"So since I'm only dead to you, I'm saying stay away and let me rest in peace. Let me rest in peace, let me get some sleep. Let me take my love and bury it in a hole 6 foot deep. I can lay my body down but I can't find my sweet release. So let me rest in peace,\\" he sings - being rather upfront and more revealing than usual. It really is truly amazing; Joss Whedon is supposed to be a writer and director of Buffy. He does this to the best of his ability yet wrote every single lyric to every song on Once More, With Feeling - he even composed the music and wrote/direct the episode! He truly is a God amongst us Buffy fans! He never stops pulling through and surprising the millions and millions of Buffy fans. Another great song is Dawn's Ballet. Dawn is captured and taken to the Bronze by the man who is making everyone sing and dance. Dawn dances around with the people who captured her to a brilliant instrumental before singing along with the main Bad Guy. Michelle Trachtenberg's voice is a little cringe-worthy, but she still gets credit for using her real voice. Anthony Stewart Head who plays Giles is a real-life singer, so it was a bonus for him to be able to sing in Once More, With Feeling. His main song is Standing. While training with Buffy in the Magic Box, he sings about how he is just standing in Buffy'sway and that he has to leave her and return to England. His voice is just fantastic. Something To Sing About is a phenomenal song. Buffy confronts the Bad Guy to rescue Dawn with the rest of the Scoobies. She accidently reveals while singing that she thinks she was in heaven when her friends brought her back from the dead in Bargaining Parts 1 and 2. Willow is racked with guilt, as are Xander, Anya, Giles and Tara. The episode ends with a kiss - between Buffy and Spike! There are also other mini songs on here such as The Mustard and The Parking Ticket - even the Mutant Enemy monster that goes \\"Grrr....Arghh!\\" at the end of every episode gets in on act! All the songs are fantastic!<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10 (what else did you expect?!)<br />The fans loved Once More, With Feeling as the episode won the biggest viewing ratings of Season 6's entire run in the UK. People who had never watched an episode of Buffy in their lives were tuning in and loving it - finding themselves addicted to the show like most of all Buffy's viewers. I hope you found this review helpful and buy this CD now! This truly is essential for Buffy fans everywhere...s way and that he has to leave her and return to England. His voice is just fantastic.

B00006F7S4|5.0|As a Beck fan and collector, from the start I have to tell you that I think that Mutations is one of Beck's best albums (too bad some of the &quot;gems&quot; are on the imports or singles!).  Sea Change is closer to Mutations than any prior release.... and it is absolutely brilliant.  Mutations was recorded quickly with minimal studio intervention.  Sea Change shows similar characteristics, but with some obvious smooth production.  There is no disco on this album, only bluesy, introspective, and somewhat tripped out songs.  Guitar work is extraordinary clear and Beck's vocals clear and upfront.  So, I guess I have a new favorite.... let's see how long it stays in my CD player.  Mutations was in rotation for over 4 months!  Bottomline:  if you liked Mutations, you will love Sea Change.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you're reading this, Joss Whedon, and if it were up to me, Under Your Spell WOULD be a smash hit.  I loved this episode of Buffy and was very excited to find out it was released on CD.  The quality of the recording is excellent (better than UPN's slightly muffled broadcast of it the first time the show aired), and the songs are extremely listenable.  I especially like (aside from the aforementioned &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;) &quot;I'll Never Tell&quot; (Not quite Sondheim, but close) and &quot;Through the Fire&quot; (Not quite &quot;Tonight Quintet,&quot; but close).  From one of the best shows on TV comes the best CD from a television show of all time.
0920668364|4.0|This book had a lot of meaning in that it showed that the relationship between a mother and her son could go a long way. It proved to me that many times a son or daughter may not appear to be affectionate but still listen when they do not appear to be. As we found out, the son knew the words to the song and used them with his newly born daughter. Love You Forever it a heart riviting, warm story that a mother and father could share with their children.
B000068PQ0|2.0|I bought this CD strictly on it's fantastic cover art.  Come<br />on, we all do that from time to time.  The music itself mimics<br />an Air album I purchased years ago but then the blind melon type voice kicked in I knew this was more of that<br />twangish-country-folkrock 90's stuff.  The sound that<br />has whole rural radio stations devoted to it.<br />As a first time listener to this album I tried to listen but was<br />forced to hit the forward button at each repetitious lyric,  stuff like &quot;yoshimi get your yellow kung fu robot something or another&quot; repeated 16x's.<br />But I've been more into Fantastic Plastic Machine, Stereolab, Defazz, Ben Folds, Roxy Music.  I realize there will be Spin magazine awards shows praising these guys but I'm still not getting it.
B0000251VS|4.0|This album, i admit is not the best of maiden but it sounds different since it's paul d'ianno who sing (you must admit that he is reaaly good, not as much as bruce but still...), but as being a maiden fan i heard it often and it propose a lot of different style, two instrumental song (wich are real cool), fast drumming guitar flamming song (purgatory), the album self titled song (killers) which is kinda &quot;off-tempo&quot;, and finally &quot;murders in the rue morgue&quot; woh!! cool. A must into any maiden fans...
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Yes , very low 3 stars ! The story is exellent ! I red it the first time , when I was 8 . The visual effects - very good ! What is missing ? <BR>1. I went to the movie theatre to watch it the first time , with my girlfriend ... before she was diagnosed with ALS... she was still able to walk then . <BR> He gave it up on the second try ?! His girlfriend's life , and possibility to save it ? No way ! I keap trying to find a way at list to slow down her progression ... and no way , I am going to give it up ... not after 2 , not after 500 tries !<BR>2. This version of the H. Wells story doesn't give me the feeling of it . It does remind me of \\" Congo \\" - too many stories in one film , and non of them was complited . You leave with amptieness , instad of thinking . Not a good sign . Not good at all !<BR>3. The old film gave me much more sutisfaction ... this one - only dissapointment .
B000003TAR|5.0|I think that this CD is the best Nirvana Album out. There are a few reasons for this. Most hardcore fans find this album their favorite as well. Nirvana's Nevermind was ingenious, but it got old, and the teen angst thing got old. But it was still a great album. Many hardcore fans, as myself, dont find some songs from that album as atracting. Even Smells Like Teen Spirit got old for me, even though it is still one of the best grunge songs of all time.<br />In Utero is different. This song is heavier and has a lot of more hardcore songs. Songs like Tourrete's, Pennyroyal Tea, Serve the Servants, Dumb, Heart Shaped Box, and All Apologies are really great songs. The lyrics have gotten angrier, and the ideas are different. Now, instead of teen angst, these songs are more about Kurt's personal life, and some of the interesting, and sometimes scary thoughts that go through his mind every day. Songs like Tourrete's are grugingly horrific! The song is about how everyone unleashes their angers in different ways, and boy, does he talk about it. &quot;Mayday, everyday, MY DAY&quot;, &quot;gonna have a heart atack, its my heart&quot;, &quot;One more at the door of my heart&quot;.<br />The songs are ingenious, the songs are hardcore and heavy, and the lyrics are amazing. This may not be for the casual mainstream listener that enjoyed only Teen Spirit, but then again, the real fans will find this album as their favorite. I have owned this CD ever since it was first released in 1993, and I still have it in the front of my many CDs in my 100 page CD holder. It is the one that I think of most, and the one that I cherrish. All fans might want to wait on buying more albums. The box set, which will feature all four cds, possibly some bootlegs, and many unrealeased studio version songs. All will be released hopefully at the end of this year. It would make a great Christmas gift!<br />Still, its a great album!

Just because Soviet sistem was afraid to admit , that in \\" perfect \\" Soviet society could be serial killers in exsistance . The most tragic part - it is based on true story !?

In \\" New \\" Russia ... and some other countries , where I lived in past few years . NOT a good sign for future generations ...
B000024D4R|4.0|Pink Floyd became even stranger and darker with the release of 'Animals'.  It tries some original ideas, such as beginning the album with a short songs and ending it with the second part of it.  The album is supposed to be based on Orwell's 'Animal Farm', but the references kind of vague.  One has to know the book, Orwell, and Waters to truly understand what is going on here.  The bulk of the album is taken up by three songs, each of them over ten minutes long.  The songs are good, but their length bogs them down a little bit.  The best song is 'Sheep', which keeps intensity all throughout.  Another highlight is 'Pigs', where in the end David Gilmore gives on of his most awesome guitar solos.  Underrated, at times boorish, but it is pure Floyd nonetheless.
0783225792|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS SO GREAT, IT'S NOT ONE OF THE FILMS THAT TAKES TIME TO GET TO THE POINT IT IS AN ONGIONG STORY THAT IS VERY ACCURATE AND RELEVANT TO THE PLOT. THIS MOVIE HAD ME ON MY TOES WHEN I FIRST SAW IT(SEPTEMBER 2002 ON STARZ AT 9:30P.M.). AFTER WATCHING THAT I RAN TO THE LOCAL DVD DEALER AND BOUGHT IT, IT WAS THAT SERIOUS. I SWEAR THIS MOVIE MADE ME PUT A HAULT TO EVERYTHING THAT I WAS DOING AT THE TIME THE MOVIE WAS ON. THE MOVIE IS GREAT FROM BEGINING TO END. THIS MOVIE HAD ME IN AWE FROM BEGINNING TO THE END! ACE WAS THE MAN, NIKKI WAS A CRAZY REAL ... MAN, DOMINICK WAS GANGSTER TOO! THE WHOLE DAMN MOVIE WAS GANGSTER, GINGER WAS A MESS BUT SHE GET'S HER PROPS ALSO. PLEASE SEE THIS IF U HAVE NOT ALREADY. ONE OF THE BEST FILMS EVER MADE U WOULDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE FILM.
0684857820|5.0|I think that Alice Sebold is a wonderful writter.  I was just looking around on Amazon.com one day and it \\"recomended\\" 'The Lovely Bones' (I cant underline that) for me.  I clicked on it and went to the \\"Look Inside\\" section. I was not really into reading all that much, but I read ALL of the book that was put on the internet and within a week purchased both of the books.  'The Lovely Bones' is wonderful, it keeps you interested.  As well as 'Lucky'.  I cant wait until she publishes another book.  For anyone looking for a good read, these are 2 books you should get!!
B000068QY7|5.0|I never thought Oasis could top 'Definitely Maybe' but after hearing this new album, they've completely outdone themselves. The Hindu Times is brilliant especially its outrageous Hindu-inspired guitar riffs. Force of Nature displays Noel's full capability of taking the lead from Liam when he wants to. Stop Crying Your Heart Out gave me goosebumps and teary eyes after hearing it for the first time. Little by Little took a few listens before it eventually stole me heart. Born on a Different Cloud I could have sworn was a Lennon/McCartney song but its still a brilliant [remake]of the great ones. Better Man is a massive rock tune that makes you want to drink Lager and become a soccer hooligan. In summation, HEATHEN CHEMISTRY is BRILLIANT. I'm absolutely mad for it. I've seen them live on every promotional gig they've done for each new album and I have never enjoyed them as much as this tour. Go buy Heathen Chemistry now!
1878424319|5.0|This book was GREAT!  Don Miguel totally breaks it down for you.  4 agreements to live by; Be impeccable with your word, Don't take things personal, Don't make assumptions, and Do your best!  I passed this book on to a few people, and EVERY ONE OF THEM LOVED IT!  I highly reccomend it to anyone who just isn't happy, and that can be for many reasons, but whatever the reason is, this book with help you realize why you aren't happy, and how to change that.  A lot of people think that &quot;self-help&quot; books are over rated, and I know, because thats how I thought, but as soon as i got this book, I couldn't even put it down.  Don Miguel give great REALISTIC examples, that happen in daily life, which throws everything into perspective.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones' voice belies her age, but not her talent for ballads. She has a tremendous, soft, soul filled voice, that lulls you into her world of great ballads. I look forward to hearing something a little more upbeat from her in the future. But for now I am content to hear her covers of classics, and her interpretations of the songs written for (and by) her.<br />Bravo Norah!
B00005LW7R|4.0|Bryn Terfel is an excellent Falstaff on this recording -- a little more restrained than he probably would be in a live performance, but still filled with gusto.  His voice is ideally rich, warm, and distinctive, but even more important is that he really knows how to act with his voice, with careful attention to the text.  The other performers are all solid and intelligent, especially the women (although Pieczonka's performance as Alice is somewhat vanilla).  I really like Roschmann's luscious middle register and soaring high notes, and Diadkova as Quickly is positively plummy (even if she does have an accent).<br />The one thing that really bothered me about this recording, however, is the engineering.  I think this is the first time I have ever heard a studio recording of an opera in which the singers all sound as if they're standing in the same spot -- throughout the entire performance!  It's almost like listening to a live recording of an unstaged CONCERT performance, rather than a staged opera performance.  Talk about lazy engineering.  One of the main reasons I bought this -- other than to hear Terfel -- was to have a modern, stereo recording of this opera in good sound.  But now I'm finding that this is not a measurable improvement over my 1950 mono recording, in terms of sound quality.<br />Okay, maybe that's a slight exaggeration, but the sound was still an unpleasant surprise, and I'm certainly no audiophile.  Although this is a very good effort, the classic Toscanini recording is still tops in my mind.
0316666343|4.0|At the start of Alice Sebold's &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; I felt warm, eveloped within Susie Salmon's world by her words and her graciousness. I expected anger from her, but got strength instead. And I had hoped it would continue that way throughout Ms. Sebold's first work of fiction, but it did not. <br />There is a point at which the minutes and days which consumed her at the beginning seem to fly by, for us and for Susie, changing the pacing of the story. And by the time a certain even very near the end of the book occurs I am no longer invested in Susie, or any of the other characters. <br />Ms. Sebold's touching, and deeply soulful story, through the first half of the book, one of the best books I've read in years. But she lost me as the time flew by and the increasingly far-fetched incidents occur. <br />While I feel this way, I would whole-heartedly reccommend this book to anyone who loves to read, Ms. Sebold's writing style is one I thoroughly enjoyed and I look forward to reading her next endeavor. I just hope her next keeps it's pace, and keeps me in love with the characters she has established from the get-go!

0618164413|5.0|I loved George so much when I was little, even before I could read.  My mom bought me one and she ended up buying all the other Georgefs books.  Mine were written all Japanese, George's books are everywhere in the world and famous.  I am 36 year-old (!) now, I still can remember some of the stories I read and adorable drawings of the books. I think this book even had an influence my \\"personality development\\" as a child. Good influences such as: be independent, be curious, be creative, be bold, be unique, be humorous, be even a little rebellious, be lovable. Very good chilren's book.
B00006F7S4|4.0|This CD sounds like a soundtrack to a lonely, cold, 4:00 AM drive down a desolate country road.  It sounds emotional and gorgeous, lush and sparse at the same time.  A collection of downer lullabies.  I have always been a casual observer of Beck.  I have really liked certain songs, but never the entire album.  The closest Beck came to drawing me in was with &quot;Mutations&quot; in 1998, but it just missed the mark.  &quot;Sea Change&quot; however, loses all of Beck's usual schitck and just strips it down to (a very gloomy) Beck, a guitar, and some lush string arrangements.  The result is amazing.  It is moving.  And YES, it IS a sleeper of a CD.  Definitely NOT a party disc.  But that's why I find it so strangely beautiful.
B000068IEU|5.0|As you can gather from reading the reviews on this movie, people either love it or hate it.  \\"Vulgar\\" reminded me a little of Last House on the Left.  If you like Dead-Alive, American Psycho, and TCM, you need to see this movie.  <br />Thank you to the producers of this DVD for the low price and extensive features...<br />I liked this movie for its stripped down realism (albeit bad acting)and its viseral depiction of the evil that men do.  Watching this is like driving by a bloody accident and not being able to turn your head away...
B00003CXE7|5.0|Director Ridley Scott brings the heat of the battle arena into your home with this action packed movie based on the fictitious life of a gladiator.  The award-winning actor Russell Crowe plays the leading role in this movie as Maximus, a Roman general turned gladiator.  With a 2 hour and 35 minute run time, this movie does not leave you wanting for adventure.<BR>     Maximus wants nothing more from life than to return to his family and take up farming again.  A friend to the people of Rome, as well as the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, he is unable to return to the life he had previously led and due to his fame, and the jealousy of that fame, the antagonist Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) attempts to have him and his family killed.  It is after the murder of his wife and son that Maximus vows to get his revenge. It is also at this point that the action intensifies making the movie the Award Winning picture that it became.  <BR>     The intense, fast paced gladiator battles set the stage, while the emotional struggle of the players set the backdrop.  Fear, honor, and vengeance all play leading roles in the outcome of this motion picture masterpiece.

B000068IEU|2.0|The story is wildly implausible both in its large features (the girls are abducted in NYC but the killers happen to take them almost to the back yard of one victim, whose parents are waiting with her 17th birthday cake, to kill them) and in many details.  Leaving his wife to her own devices with the guests they now know to be homicidal psychopaths, the victim's father rummages in his basement workshop for materials to build elaborate booby traps for their daughter's killers; meanwhile the mother copes with her grief over learning an hour earlier of her child's death by seducing and gnawing off the penis of one of the killers.  Curiously, only the psychopathic killers are rendered with any psychological realism, and stand out like live-action figures among cartoon characters.<br />The scenes of violence would be affecting, with their realism and cruelty, in some other context--a plausible story. A quieter or even musicless soundtrack (like _I Spit on Your Grave_'s) would also have helped.  The hokey hippie folk-music soundtrack and awkward comic moments (mostly from a pair of bumbling policemen with far too much screen time) leave the viewer unable to take the violence seriously by creating the impression that the filmmakers did not take it seriously.  Among this DVD's extra features, Wes Craven's explanations for going to brutal extremes in the less hokey and more nauseating parts of the film are  vacuous.  On the subject of Phyllis Stone's guts, he argues that he had to go there to show how awful it is, but promises never to go back.  Of course, others had already been there and done that, better than this clumsy, stupid film.  Some nasty things exist and art is about things that exist, he dissertates.  This, of course, is an argument for a movie about boogers as much as for _The Last House on the Left_, and the former might be more touching and interesting.  Perhaps he should have tried to explain, not why the violence is realistic in his film, but why only the violence (and the violent) are realistic in his film.<br />If, like this reviewer, you like to be shocked and disgusted and terrified, try the nice Elite edition of _I Spit_ or wait for a good DVD of Craven's much better film, _The Hills Have Eyes_.  _Last House_ does not meet the connoisseur's high standard for exploitative trash.
B00006RCLQ|5.0|&quot;Carnival of Souls,&quot; the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature). Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.<br />&quot;Carnvial of Souls&quot; came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, &quot;Curse of the Living Corpse&quot; (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field. Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 &quot;Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls&quot; debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.  Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.ls&quot; debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.

B00000K0EA|5.0|Out of the 3 Brosnan 007 films released so far, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" is the best. GoldenEye and TWINE had their moments, but they seemed to drag at times.<br />With \\"TND,\\" the action is non-stop, the villians are memorable, and the 2 hours go by like a flash! Michelle Yeoh is refreshing as the tough, brainy Bond girl who is just about Bond's equal when it comes to duking it out.<br />The sound effects and special effects make this one a great show-off disc for your home theatre system. I know, since my friend insists on playing it every time I am over his house.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I've been waiting for Beauty and the Beast on DVD ever since I bought a player back in 1997.  I am happy to say I am not disappointed.  Disney has wisely included three versions of the movie.  The original theatrical release, the special edition including the new musical number &quot;Human Again&quot;, and the work-in-progress which was shown in New York in October 1991.  The movie looks and sounds great on DVD.  The extras are nothing to write home about.  Most of it is promotional stuff for other Disney products.  However, the tribute to the late Howard Ashman is touching and appropriate considering he was the brains behind this masterpiece.  Disney animated features since Beauty and the Beast have ranged from fair &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Aladdin&quot; to downright lousy &quot;Pocahantas&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;.  Howard Ashman is definetely a missed person in the Disney idea department as they have never measured up to this film since.  As a Law and Order fan, it's also a hoot to see Lt Lenny Bricoe (Jerry Orbach) singing into a microphone.  Since this is in limited release I will probably buy another copy to have around in case something happens to my original.  So why all the praise and only four stars?  I don't like the idea that this and all other Disney DVD's start with those rancid trailers.  Sure I can hit the menu button but it's still a pain.
B00005M91K|4.0|I have to say that while I first watched the movie the movie was a big drag--I just wasn't in the mood for that type of music. Well, I happen to have been watching it on my computer, so I turned the volume off on the movie, played an mp3 of DJ MF (DrumNBassics), which you can download off kazaa, or if not, write me and I'll send you a copy. I have to tell you the music perfectly complimented the music. I saw it all the way through, with the dj set having to be played about 2.5 times. A strange thing happened while I was listening: When I had to replay the set, that's when the film switched over to the Asian industrialized city. Whoa. Anyways, I recommend this movie for all the dnb heads out there. It's hard for us to get any thing real out there, and this movie is about as real as it gets. There's no dialogue or plot to this movie, but it's still more than worth watching. By leaving these things out, he frees himself in other ways. The landscape is amazing, the theme of the movie is strictly up to you, and the journey is well worth it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The latest and most recent Beatles compilation disc is<BR>probably a good place to start if you want a single disc<BR>that surveys their work. Of course, if you really want to<BR>get into the depth of their work, the best option would<BR>be to buy their studio albums first, and then proceed to <BR>other Beatles albums like compilation and live albums.<BR>This is a good collection of lovesongs, ballads, and rock,<BR>even though the album is slanted towards more pop, which<BR>isn't surprising, given the amount of success the Beatles<BR>enjoyed in this area. <BR>  People have to keep in mind the selection of tracks<BR>for this compilation is restricted to singles which made<BR>the top of the charts in the UK, the USA or both.  <BR>Personally I feel this is a good overview for a single<BR>CD, and the number of tracks (27) is fairly generous.<BR>If you're a huge Beatles fan, you're better off passing<BR>on this collection. However, if you're curious, or a<BR>beginner, I can't think of a better place to start.<BR>This CD might help you decide on whether or not you<BR>want to pursue purchasing studio albums by this band.<BR>In terms of length, the CD runs approximately 80 minutes.<BR>  There are people who are complaining because not all <BR>their most popular songs made the cut on this album.<BR>It's impossible. Even if you buy the Red and Blue <BR>albums, there are tracks on 1 that aren't available<BR>on the Red or Blue albums. The Beatles were a singles<BR>band, whose albums sales were driven by this fact. <BR>Surprisingly, this is the only Beatles album to date<BR>that has earned the distinction of being the top-selling<BR>album of the calendar year. This album earned that <BR>distinction in 2000.<BR>  This collection is essentially an updated version of<BR>the 1982 Capitol release 20 Greatest Hits, with 7 additional<BR>tracks. I believe that title is now out of print. For <BR>those of you who are wondering, the 7 tracks you get<BR>on this album that you don't get on their 20 Greatest<BR>Hits album are: From Me To You, Daytripper, Yellow<br />Submarine, Eleanor Rigby, Lady Madonna, The Ballad<BR>of John and Yoko and Something. The songwriting is<BR>good, and the way the music behind the songs maybe<BR>even better than the lyrics themselves. Of course,<BR>not everyone has the same opinion with regards to<BR>what constitutes quality songs, and what is garbage.<BR>  If you want to know why The Beatles are the top<BR>selling act of alltime by far (165,000,000 albums<BR>sold and counting), this would be probably a good<BR>place to start if you're on a budget, and can't<BR>afford to get all their albums.

B00003CXB2|5.0|Ok, I must admit. I'm a sucker for epics. I love their scope, their feel, the time they take to go over all the details of their subjects' lives. A good epic immerses you into their world. It's good to get lost in an epic, and I got lost in Lawrence of Arabia.<br />Telling the story of T.E. Lawrence in his attempt to bring the feuding clans of Arabs together during the World War II, this film is beautiful in its leisure ness, exciting in its action, and absolutely breathtaking in its cinematography. At the time of its release, it had to be the most beautiful filmed motion picture ever made.<br />Fresh from his success in the film Bridge on the River Kwai, director David Lean sought to make a film of equal greatness. Instead he surpassed it. For any film buffs, Lawrence of Arabia is a must have for their collection. Its influence in modern filmmakers alone is amazing, Steven Spielberg in particular. The wonder Spielberg saw in this film is evident in his own filmography; from the desert scapes in his Indiana Jones films to the intimacy of Schindler's List.<br />Fantastic performances by a young Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness and the rest of the cast bring the story to vivid life. In particular, O'Toole becomes Lawrence. It's clear the actors believed in their characters, and in the movie.<br />Filled with classic moments that still to this day inspire awe and power in its audiences, such as the slow approach by stranger on horseback to the well Lawrence and his companion drink from, this film is fantastic on all levels. A must-see, must-own for any lover of film.
0066620694|4.0|This is a book that packs academic research around a key insight driving disruptive change.  The authors cite ample research in the hard disk and other industries to track why most companies fail to anticipate the key changes in their markets.  <br />The very counterintuitive insight presented is that market leaders get trapped into listening to their current customers too much.  Current customers relatively satisfied with current products tend not to drive price/performance leaps.  The distruptions come from new companies that target ways of reaching low end customers that are considered too small for major players.  When the low end technology reaches a certain maturity, it winds up capturing the entire market.  Seems simple, but very few companies anticipate this.  The book walks through the research supporting this, as well as suggestions for how companies can cope.<br />The one knock...  The business climate is changing from a \\"Let's topple the market\\" to \\"Let's refine our business\\".  In the short term, we'll see less market making moves, and that will diminish the relevance of this book.  If the idea sticks to the next upwards trend, then Christiansen will have his place among the great gurus.<br />Do read the book.  I wish there was a 4.5 star rating to give.  You make the call.
B00000K3UR|3.0|Released:  1999<BR>Running Time:  93 minutes<BR>Director:  Dennis Dugan<BR>Cast:   Adam Sandler as Sonny Koufax<BR> Joey Lauren Adams as Layla Maloney<BR> Jon Stewart as Kevin Gerrity<BR> Cole Sprouse as Julian McGrath-Gerrity<BR> Dylan Sprouse as Julian McGrath-Gerrity<BR> Josh Mostel as Arthur Brooks<BR> Leslie Mann as Corinne Maloney<BR> Allen Covert as Phil D'Amato<BR> Rob Schneider as Nazo<BR> Kristy Swanson as Vanessa<BR> Joseph Bologna as Lenny Koufax<BR> Peter Dante as Tommy<BR> Jonathan Loughran as Mike<BR> Steve Buscemi as Homeless Guy<BR> Tim Herlihy as Singing Kangaroo<br />Color:  Technicolor<br />Sound Mix:  DTS/Dolby/SDDS <br /> This film is a comedy that takes place in New York City, about a thirty-year old guy (Adam Sandler played as Sonny Koufax), that decides to take on the responsibility of a five-year old child (Julian McGrath-Gerrity).  His decision is based on a recent breakup with his girlfriend who left him because she wanted the commitment of a marriage and family.  She also expects him to find full-time work and to be a more responsible person for his actions...<br /> The plot involves the five-year-old child, Julian being dropped off at Sonny apartment with a note explaining that the mother cannot take care of the boy any longer.  The child is actually the son of Sonny's roommate, Kevin Gerrity (Jon Stewart).  Kevin had just received a promotion and was at the airport on his way to China when Sonny called him and explained the situation.  Sonny assured Kevin he would take care of everything and had planned on returning the child to social services the following morning.  The more time Sonny spent with the child, the more aware he became of his feelings for him.  <br /> Sonny decided as a father, Julian should make his own choices in life because when Sonny was a child he always had to do what someone else told him to.  Julian decided to change his name to Frankenstein, dress the way he wanted, eat whatever and whenever he wanted and go tobed when he wanted.  When Julian started school it became obvious that his was not the correct way to raise a child...  <br />On a scale of one to five (five is the best), I would give this film a three.  I thought this was a good film but only moderately funny.

The children will be able appreciate at the end of the story when the roles are reversed and the father is now singing the song to his own daughter.

0803292406|4.0|This review is for the edition published by the University of Nebraska Press, and it's based more on the design of the book than on the story itself.  This is a perfect example of how to make a work of classic literature more appealing.  Honestly, it's no surprise to me that most people avoid classics, seeing what they're given... Publishers' attitudes towards classic literature these days seems to be to produce the cheapest version that they can with no regard to the appeal of the book.  They're already ahead in that they don't have to pay the author any royalties, but then most will also use an obscure painting or generic photo for the book cover that usually has very little to do with the contents and makes for an overall boring package.  It certainly doesn't help the reader's attitude toward the book in particular.  Apparently, the UNP understands this, and they decided to do something about it with many of their books.  This particular edition of \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" has a cover and illustrations by Barry Moser, woodcut artist extraordinaire.  The pictures are very atmospheric, with a heavy reliance on shadow.  This makes the dark nature of the story all the more substantial.  Even the typeface looks good.  Overall, a lot of care was put into the production of this edition.  The book is about the same size as a mass market paperback, so it will fit easily on your shelf.  That's a sensible thing, as the story is actually quite short, so there's no reason to release it in an oversized format with enlarged type and an increased price.<br />In case you're wondering; yes, I do like the story.  In fact, I've enjoyed it ever since I was a child.  This edition just makes it all the more special to me.  The only negative I can see is that you have to pay ... retail for a fairly small book, but the overall package makes it worth it.
B000002HK4|5.0|Usually I try to avoid reviewing cds immmediately after purchasing them, in case my initial period of (extreme) enthusiasm clouds my judgement. Im certain that in this case, there is no need. How were Dream theater to follow the stunning 'Awake' set? Heres how. This song was first written in 1989, and underwent many revampings until being finally released here. Clocking in at 23 minutes, its a lengthy ride, and a series of cover songs from an 'Uncovered' gig make up the rest of the cds running time. Yet it should be 'A change of seasons' we concern ourseleves with. Although it flashes by as a seamless whole, it is segemented in seven sections, and the entire thing functions as a kind of cycle, penned as it is in the ususal Dream Theater story telling style. The sound is extremely varied, with some very heavy sections reminiscent of 'Awake', and lengthy instrumental interludes. The musicianship is stunning throughout, which practically goes without saying. The rest of this review I feel should be deicated solely to praise, for this really is a very special song. Put simply it is utterly incredible, like taking the best features of Dream Theater, refining them and amalgamting them into one single symphony which showcases every single facet of their talent. All the players are on fine form, and James la Brie's vocals have never sounded stronger. The final moment of 'The Crimson Sunset', the songs final section, is possibly the most moving, emotive musical entity Ive ever had contact with.<br />I really cannot recommend this enough. Id hesitate to say its the best song Ive ever heard, yet I find it hard to think of anything Ive encountered thus far that can match this stunning piece of work. I can think of no reason why anyone should not buy this. It is well, well worth whatever you pay, and even the running time, which could alienate some fades in significance when one sits down to listen to the songs and finds 23 minutes flashing by without you having even noticed.<br />A contender for the best Dream Theater song, and heavyweight contender for my favourite song.<br />You really cannot afford not to own this.<br />A galaxy of stars.contender for the best Dream Theater song, and heavyweight contender for my favourite song.<BR>You really cannot afford not to own this.<BR>A galaxy of stars.

1558808000|4.0|What a perfect movie for Michael J. Fox. He truly is a funny person. He carried off this movie completely. By showing the culture shock of leaving the farm and coming to the big city and living in a place that should be condemend, is an accurate pictorial of what it can be like. The directing scene in his studio apartment is so funny. Furthermore, I can relate to his determination in succeeding. How he goes about accomplishing this is so inspiring. However, the best part is when they are all in the main house running from room to room is hilarious. To top if all off, they come back together to pull off the take over and become friends. What a corky way to establish success. With the boss's wife being such a flirt, putting it mildly, this actress played the part very well. Your in the game if you get to sit and rub elbows with the suits and talk business on the lawn. This was a very funny movie; great job.
B000001FYL|5.0|No joke.  This has to be some of the best songwriting, singing, and playing ever.  With \\"Blaze of Glory\\" and \\"Miracle\\", you get what everyone expects with Bon Jovi, big songs with big passion.  These are two really good songs too, but if that's all you are here for you are missing out on a whole lot more.  \\"Santa Fe\\" is a song about a man who knows that he ain't ever gonna see heaven because of the men he's killed, but that's alright he's going to Santa Fe to kill some more with no regrets.  \\"Blood Money\\" is the definitive 'brothers on two different sides of the law' story.  While hearing this song you can almost see Billy the Kid talking to Pat Garrett.  \\"Bang a Drum\\" sometimes gives me chills because of the religious tone of it.  Buy this CD, listen to all the songs, and then listen again.  I am sure you will gain new respect for Jon Bon Jovi.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Excellent - I already had audiotapes of these performances and I am now glad to have the CD's, too. One doesn't regret the money.
B00005J9M3|4.0|When i went and bought this album my expectations were not high, and with good reason. When it was released, &quot;Behavior&quot; received very mediocre reviews. I guess it was the context: people expected an explosive dance album, and not the melancholy late-night music they received. &quot;Very&quot; proved the PSBs iconic dance-album, while this one still remains on the backshelf of most cd stores.<br />Well, is it any good then? Yes. Worth buying? Yes. My favourites?<br />Being Boring 5/5 - wonderful muted beginning, transforming into one of the PSBs best, if underated hits, probably because of its brooding, yearning quality...not a song to dance to, in case ur wondering. note the subtle references to HIV. <br />Only the wind 4/5 - melancholy, poignant, really typifies this album. i like the touch of the piano.<br />So Hard 5/5 - Now this was the big dance hit from the album (but it's hardly characteristic of it as a whole). Great, nonetheless.<br />Jealousy 5/5 - Perfect late night music, reminding me so much of how melancholy an empty city street can be at &quot;dead of night.&quot; The closing fanfare of trumpets is brilliant as well - a revelation in sadness.
B000003TA4|5.0|One word can symbolize the entire early 90's hard rock scene... Grunge.  I know, I know, I hate the term, but it's what it was.  And the crown jewel of the 90's grunge era, was infact, with out a doubt, Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind.&quot;  Track after track, riff after riff, and drum hit after drum hit, the album gains momentum towards the late half of the album.  Not very many cd's can claim that to this day.  I have always broken this album into 2 parts; the Radio half, and the unheard half.  Most people heard of Nirvana through radio, and only listened to those, Radio Songs.  But listen to tracks 7 through 12 again, and be amazed like I am everytime I hear the album.  I'm not saying that 1 through 6 are weak, just 7 through 12 have more substance.  I am a HUGE Nirvana fan, but sadly, this album isn't their best work.  But still, 5 out of 5 is what this masterpiece deserves.<BR>          The great tracks of this cd are the lesser known one's.  'Drain You' is an extremely powerful song with lyrics that really make you think.  And 'Lounge Act' is a track that just screams raw rock.  I highly suggest people purchase this album.  It is, and always will be, a part of music history.  This album, brought Hard Rock back to the front of mainstream music.  Where it belongs.
B00000DFSK|3.0|I bought this cd as someone who had never listened to a U2 cd before. Surprisingly, I had heard almost all of the first ten tracks on the radio and television before. I now know why I hadn't heard the remaining four: they are TERRIBLE.  <br />Stunning, powerful, explosive guitar riffs, painful subject matter...these adjectives all characterize that wonderful opening. It sounds as if U2 actually care about the music that they write, as if they were personally involved in many of the events most of us simply read in a history book. <br />But the last four just seem to fizzle out into nothing; it's hard to even imagine that U2 sing them. And please, if I hear another duet with BB King by a rock band I'm going to scream. There's a reason why rock should not be combined with blues...quite frankly, the end is just a huge mess.<br />Nonetheless, don't let this whinging put you off buying the album - it's still fantastic, I just think it would be more worthwhile buying U2's individual albums which mesh together far better. <br />I'd recommend &quot;The Unforgettable Fire,&quot; &quot;The Joshua Tree,&quot; &quot;Achtung Baby,&quot; (for some of their early 90s sound), and &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind&quot; (which marked their recent resurgence in popularity).

B000069AUI|5.0|My friend and I were having an argument about which was better: &quot;Parachutes&quot; or &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head.&quot; He prefers the former, while I prefer the latter. <br />His argument in a nutshell: the album is not consistent enough to warrant a higher rating than Parachutes. He points to &quot;God put a smile on your face,&quot; &quot;Daylight,&quot; and &quot;Green Eyes.&quot; I actually agreed with him, both that these were weak songs and that ARBTH was less consistent. <br />Nonetheless, my argument went that, despite these minor flaws, many of the songs on ARBTH far transcend those on Parachutes. I pointed to &quot;Politik&quot; (very inaccessible but brilliant once u get into it), &quot;In My Place,&quot; (one of Coldplay's best riffs ever), &quot;The Scientist&quot; (great melancholic piano work), &quot;Clocks,&quot; (my personal favourite - far surpasses my ex-favourite &quot;Trouble&quot; on Parachutes, brilliant high-octane piano work, makes u want to run outside and just dance around), &quot;A Whisper&quot; (weird but wonderful, with a very powerful chorus), the title track (poignant - oscillating between jubilance and depression), and finally &quot;Amsterdam&quot; (an absolute masterpiece, best closing to an album i have ever heard, quiet, brooding and lifting to a striking finale with guitars powering away).<br />So, you be the judge. Go out and get both albums. YOU WONT REGRET IT!

B00005JK8K|5.0|WINDTALKERS is yet another top quality film in an already saturated war film market. It contains all the elements any successful war movie needs. First off, the action sequences are top notch. Everything from the hand to hand combat, to the fly-by bombing raids, is displayed brilliantly. The storyline that pushes the film forward is one you care about, which adds the much needed emotional level. Many films with their base in action leave this element on the sideline.<BR>Nicolas Cage in this movie gives perhaps the most controlled and soulful performance of his career as a shell-shocked warrior who no longer seems to fear death and who no longer is able to form emotional attachments.<BR>John Woo makes Windtalkers his own by combining the style and concerns of his earlier work with retro-sounding music and other war-movie conventions.<BR>WINDTALKERS is a quality piece of cinema. It has action, suspense, and real emotions. Cage and Beach are both solid in their leading roles, and their supporting cast is there to brace them at every turn. If you like drama and movies that make you think, then WINDTALKERS is a perfect fit for you.
6303421563|5.0|This movie is a phenomenal piece of work.  The acting is extraordinary and the plot and suspense superb.  It is dramatic, suspenseful, intriguing, and deeply touching.  It is a movie you won't soon forget.  The young Natalie Portman is masterful and will win you over.
6304595247|1.0|There is very little about this unhappy farrago that is right - the music, Janet McTeer  ...  that's about it, really.<br />Ralph Fiennes, monumentally miscast, tries hard, but is never equal to Heathcliff.  He ends up coming across as just plain vicious and bad-tempered.<br />Juliette Binoche, equally at sea, never stands a chance as either of the Catherines.  It isn't her fault she has a French accent, and that isn't the main problem - it was just unrealistic to expect a young woman with an uncertain grasp of the language to get to grips with one of the most complex characters in world literature.<br />Only Janet McTeer, as Ellen Dean comes out of this mess with any credit.<br />The Wharfedale scenery is beautiful, but hopelessly wrong.  They couldn't even build a convincing-looking &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;.  It looks like the progeny of Walt Disney and Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria.  <br />The music, by Ryuichi Sakamoto is exquisite, but also sits a little uneasily in the film.<br />The script is just - well - hopeless.  Chunks of direct quotation cobbled together with utterly banal drivel.<br />Stay away.
B000005ILF|4.0|Sting's albums are of such high quality, that simply a new release can garner 5 stars. Given what we've come to expect from \\"the Man,\\" however, Mercury Falling is a disappointment. Had he continued on the path first initiated in Soul Cages and then Ten Summoner's Tales, this would have been a much more original and stimulating effort. Instead, he inexplicably chose to record an album bathed in the Tennessee-recording-studio sound, a la Stax and Nashville, replete with country songs embellished by slide guitar, alongside soul thumpers dressed up with Memphis horns. Despite the impressive production, the bland results leave the listener unsatisfied.  Sting's ability to play and sing are not in question, no matter what the material, but his writing genius is revealed only when he remains true to his instincts. There are some treats here--- such as Kenny Kirkland's tasty piano solo in La Belle Dame Sans Regret and the playful odd-time signature jockeying in I Was Brought to My Senses (despite the dirge of an introduction)--- which still recommend this album. In contrast, some selections, such as All Four Seasons, Lithium Sunset, and Valparaiso, will find you questioning their worth.  Granted, if it's Sting, it still merits a listen. Overall, though, this CD is just not equal to his usual high standard, and fans need to seek his more recent explorations to witness the master at work once again.
B000065V3H|5.0|After exceeding all expectations with their remarkable 20th Anniversary TRON dvd, Disney returns to their standard practice of offering less bang for your buck.  The House That Mickey Built brings this charmingly winsome romantic comedy into the digital age with a middling transfer, botched menus, and no extras whatsoever. Oh yes, silly me...we DO get a theatrical trailer, just not one for THIS movie.  Perhaps Disney expects people to pick up the BEACHES dvd to get the CAN'T BUY ME LOVE trailer.  If that's their thinking, it truly IS a Magic Kingdom...
6305313687|5.0|This film is not meant for everyone.. It is not made for politicians.... This movie was meant for the hip and young generation that is now in college or high school..  It is about how people can be driven to hate because they made mistakes and it doesnt mean they are pure evil...  You can say \\"yeah, well everyone knows racism is bad\\" , but the truth is not that... many people are ok witht he concept. In fact in my freshman year of high school many of my friends seemed to be racist, most of them also seemed to do drugs and be suverely depressed. Neo-Nazis are americas white youth that is being mistreated fighting  back at a scapegoat for their hate... Neo-Nazi's are one of the many groups like that, there are gangs,cults, and other hate groups as well.<br /><br />  Not everyone knows racism is horrible. Maybe lots of people over the age of 30 do because they are more mature and many are very firmiliar with the subject, but the young men and woman in are society do not all know this.They have lots of phsychal power and can gain followers just by acting/looking \\"cool\\"<br /><br />  It is a subject that still exisist's in many schools today even if people refuse to believe it. Most kids who get involved in this type of crime never expect to really get into huge fights or even kill someone, but it can happen and it does, because are elders fail to give us a reason not to...  A book would not be read by all, an MTV program would just be considered B.S. since many of these hate mongors are too mature for MTV's pop culture trying to tell them whats right and wrong.  Now wait..., Isn't a movie pop-culture????  I see no way this is anything like \\"scream\\" or \\"scary Movie\\"  it is drama.<br /><br />  Don't even bother watching the movie if you think that everyone knows right from wrong and if they're not they should die. This movie lead me away from the world of hate I almost fell into and it has helped many others.
6305350205|5.0|While many fans consider this the weak link in the STAR TREK movie canon, the fact remains that, until the release of STAR TREK VI - THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY some years later, STAR TREK V was the best received entry in the series since 1986's smash-hit, THE VOYAGE HOME. Also, FINAL FRONTIER has the unique distinction of being the only film in cinematic history for which seatbelts were installed in movie theaters, a truly remarkable accomplishment and one that's unlikely to be repeated.  Boasting a crisp transfer and Paramount's usual treasure-trove of behind-the-scenes extras, this is one Trek not to be missed!
0380977788|5.0|You've already heard about how creepy this children's book for all ages is, I'm sure.  So I won't dwell on that (although it is easily as creepy as _any_ book for adults..)<BR>  What I liked most about this book was the prose style.  At once simple, rich, charming and creepy, it reminds me almost of a sort of novel-length haiku, or an old fairytale, the kind they cut out of the later collections because  it was too odd, too frightening, too disturbing for their sensibilities. Does that make sense?  <BR>  I also especially like the character of Coraline.  She is a perfect portrayal of an intelligent, resouceful, brave girl who is nevertheless still a child, with all that entails.  At no point do her actions (or those of anyone else in the book) seem out of character.  It's easy to tell Gaiman is a father. <BR>  The surreal world Coraline enters is great as well, like a wonderful dream that twists and becomes a nightmare.   <BR>  By the way, I have to disagree with the previous reviewer: I _loved_ the illustrations, because it's _easy_ for a trained artist with a smidgen of talent to draw true to life, but suggesting the essence of a subject is a lot harder and a lot creepier.  There are worse things lurking in your imagination than any artist could possibly represent, and I think Dave McKean's pictures tap into that, particularly the cover illustration, which is the most perfectly suited I have ever seen.  <BR>  If I had to think of one negative thing to say about this book, it would be that the use of the phrase \\"glorious romp\\" near the end of the book bugs me because it feels dated.  That's it.  That was _all_ I didn't like.  <BR>  To sum up, this is a truly wonderful book.  And yes, it's creepy, but it's not a tragedy, and it ends positively.  You won't need therapy (probably), but you'll never forget _Coraline_.
0920668364|4.0|I just heard this book read aloud to my class.  As I listened to the story, I pictured my twin girls in my arms.  Maybe I'm just becoming sappy in my advanced age, but the book really touched me.  I'm sure my girls will enjoy hearing mommy or daddy reading this book to them.  The message to all kids is that you will always be your parents' child and their love for you is unconditional.  What better message can we send our children?
0060278234|5.0|This book is a great sequel to Sabriel, and is just as - or more - exciting.

B0000683WG|5.0|A second CD of T-Rex demos and extras seems to miss the point of T-Rex's carefree-sounding pop, and I've yet to listen to it. Not so much on principle, but because the remastering of the main CD is so good. Makes me glad to live at this moment when so many vinyl classics are getting reissued digitally.
0064471837|4.0|A really good book; exciting and makes you want to know what's going to happen. Recommended!!!
6305169187|4.0|This is quite a clever movie - it's is ostensiblyabout diverting the course of an asteroid about to hit Earth, but in fact it is about a father and daughter's relationship and the bond between a group of friends who work together on an oil rig. The leads are played well by Willis &amp; Liv Tyler, and the ever reliable Steve Buscemi and Ben Affleck provide great support as a technician and Tyler's love interest respectively. Billy Bob Thornton is also worth mentioning as he adds a touch of class to the star-studded cast.<br />The large scale effects on the oil rigs are handled exceptionally well, possibly better than the space scenes, although these too are better than average. The story is OK, but a bit sinilar to Deep Impact and the real point of the story is the interpersonal relationships.<br />Great fun to watch.
185984054X|4.0|a tough read about the holiest woman out there<BR>its tough to say you like a book thats so condemning of a person you thought was doing the world some good but at the same time its refreshing to understand and see exposed the egotism that arises when one person is credited with all that is good and some of the actions that person has taken thinking her way is the best way. not an easy read for the beach but rather a sit down study
B000002U82|5.0|This is Pink Floyds first big post- Barret album. And it rocks!<BR> The music showed Pink Floyd at a time when they all wrote songs together and weren't led by soully by Roger Waters (Make someone who knows nothing about pink floyd listen to this and then The Final Cut and see if they can tell it is the same band). The music is excellent (I can't believe anyone was shallow enough to give it 1 star) and there is no filler (unlike the wall). The concept (insanity to be very basic) and music are good enough to make you want to go insane yourself.<BR> To top it off it ends perfectly with Eclipse.<BR>(note: if you have never synchronised this with  wizard of oz and you are curious  start playing at the third roar of the MGM lion. There are some neat coincidences. Or are they coincidences?)
0790734850|5.0|For an amazingly complex book, I thought the filmmakers did a brilliant job. It stands alone as a movie.<br />The only problem with eliding some of the characters, and the necessarily more attenuated plot was that we lost much of the politics and inner motivations of some characters - especially Jack Vincennes ans Ed Exley.<br />Also, everyone raves about Russell Crowe's acting, and he certainly does smash up a lot, but I found Kevin Spacey absolutely compelling. He burned up the screen. Guy Pearce was terrific too. James Cromwell is perfectly cast as the malevolent Dudley Smith.<br />Last night I watched Chinatown, same genre, earlier. Funnily enough I had never seen it, and realise it is now nearly 30 years old!<br />It looks FANTASTIC. It feels fantastic. It is perhaps the perfect film.<br />Actually, it's why in the end I think LA Confidential is a 9.5/10, and Chinatown a 10/10. The latter has an original, not adapted screenplay, and can work its own rhymes and rythmns. LA Confidential stands on its own as a great movie, but if you have read the book you may hunger for a little more of the intricacies which, understandably cannot be brought to the screen.
B00006B1HH|5.0|Grease has finally made its debut on the DVD format.  The movie is a long time favorite thanks to countless airings on television that constantly brought in new fans of the movie who weren't even born when the movie was released in 1978.  Adapting the immensely popular Broadway show to the big screen brought forth some changes. The theater production had a raunchier edge to it with much more overt sexual nature. The film tones that side quite a bit, but it makes up for it in sheer exuberance.  John Travolta was the hottest star in Hollywood at the time with the success of Saturday Night Fever on the big screen and Welcome Back Kotter on television.  He is perfectly cast as Danny Zuko, the likable greaser and leader of the T-Birds who falls for the wholesome Sandy Olsen played by Olivia Newton-John in her big screen debut.  Ms. Newton-John can clearly handle the singing side of the role, but her acting and dancing are suspect at best.  Jeff Conaway adds the right amount of toughness as Kenicke and Stockard Channing is excellent as Rizzo, the tough as nails head of the Pink Ladies (Ms. Channing's singing is better than Ms. Newton-John's acting, but not by much and seems oddly out of place as a teenager).  The films is full of actors and singers who were popular in the 50's like Frankie Avalon, Sid Caesar, Edd Byrnes and Eve Arden.  Grease is extremely entertaining and pure fun to watch and is really the last success old fashioned movie musical Hollywood produced.

B000002G7E|5.0|Just address some of the negative reviews: Hey, everyone's entitled to their opinions, but I for one have never used \\"White Light/White Heat\\" as background music for any kind of sexual act, and yes, I do indeed listen to it.  I have been listening to it for 19 years as I write this.  Not to everyone's taste and not for the faint of heart, but it is indeed a classic.
B00005B1W5|5.0|This is a great DVD.....wonderful music and culture.  It should also be known that contrary to someone else's opinion here...Yanni fans do not just consist of power hungry people with big bucks so you can put your $$$ and your wide screen TV back in your pocket and keep to intelligent comments.
B000002LGW|4.0|It would be easy to laugh contemptuously at the thought of a synth pop act releasing a live album (a double one, at that), but Depeche Mode have done so and pulled it off quite well.  &quot;101&quot; is a recording of their famous concert at Pasadena, which elevated them to a full-blown live act capable of selling out at huge American venues.  Rock purists will complain that these performances are too clean and efficient, but that's the reason why &quot;101&quot; works.  Unlike other rock live albums, there's hardly any off-key singing or shrill, distracting noises.  The Mode pulls off the recording like seasoned pros.  I really liked the live rendition of the love ballad &quot;Somebody,&quot; and the single &quot;Strangelove&quot; loses none of the bite of the original studio recording.  Dave Gahan really gets the crowd roused during &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Question of Time,&quot; two energetic, upbeat numbers.  But the CD hits its high point with their hit &quot;Everything Counts,&quot; which eventually was released as a single.  Quite frankly, I've heard better live albums, but &quot;101&quot; is sufficient evidence that electronic acts can hold their own on the stage just as well as their rock peers.
B0000640VO|2.0|This is a movie that will solve anybody's constipation. Except for the traveling gnome, and a few funny moments, this movie is overrated.  If you like the director's other films (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen, etc.), then you'll like this.  For me, it felt like hours to watch this thing. Yes, it was beautifully photographed, but the story, attempting to be cute and engaging, falls short.
B000009EUM|4.0|Until right this minute, I've admired a-ha in the privacy of my closet. So now I come forward with my shocking revelation: I like this CD. Following the platinum debut \\"Hunting High and Low\\" (which had their US No. 1 single \\"Take on Me\\"), the trio from Norway returns with more of the same catchy fun on their followup, 1986's \\"Scoundrel Days.\\" Although it sold reasonably well in Europe, it was a bust on these American shores, which is a shame, for it had more of the same bouncy pop tunes that made their debut such a guilty pleasure. The chilly vibe of \\"The Swing of Things,\\" the catchy \\"Cry Wolf,\\" and the soaring closer \\"The Soft Rains of April\\" are agreeable, sunny tunes that made this album a pop favorite of mine during my high school years. Morten's voice vaguely recalls Bryan Ferry, and it nicely compliments the synth-laced music. Relatively speaking, this is overall shallow stuff, but \\"Scoundrel Days\\" is like eating a bowl of Froot Loops: it's sweet and will satisfy your appetite--if only for the moment.

B000062YAZ|5.0|From a band that started in the early 80's and also who started this dark demented speed metal music comes one of the best albums of all time. I agree by far that this CD is manditory for any true metal heads collection (NOT a limpbisket or slipnot loser) there will never be metal this good ever again. i dont feel this is the best thing to come from slayer but everyone has they're own opinions. When i got my hands on south of heaven back in 1989 i thought it was the best sounding metal ever made, and even now still feel that way.  Buy this CD, it is a milestone in speed metal by far!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam is undeniably the most ingenius band of their/my time. If I could give this album 10 stars I would... Pearl Jam dares to be different and makes music for themselves first and their fans second. Imagine that, a band that puts their time and effort into reinventing themselves and their music rather than worrying about how high they are on the Billboard chart. What other band in history has taken care of their fans the way Pearl Jam does? Bootlegs, Christmas singles, rareties, Dvd's. Inspiring lyrics, poetry and raw emotion/energy is lost on those looking for another Ten...and by the way, Riot Act is incredible!!
0920668372|4.0|This is a wonderful book for people of all ages.  Makes a great gift for baby showers, birthdays, Mothers' Day and even graduations.  Simple, yet heartwarming story of the bond between a mother and her child.  Excellent for reading aloud to children.  This book is a favorite of many moms, as well.  Don't be surprised if you have to dab your eyes when you're finished reading!
B000059H99|5.0|This was one of the best Action/Drama movies ever made. John G. Avildsen(The Karate Kid) did a good job with this movie. It is about a boxer named Rocky \\"The Itallian Stallion\\" Balboa(Sylvester Stallone), who never got along with his trainer Mickey(Burgess Merideth). Then when Rocky is chosen to fight the Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers), it is up to Mickey to train him. During that time, Rocky falls for shy girl Adrian(Talia Shire) and during the time while Rocky trains, their relationship grows. Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers and Burgess Merideth give great performances, while Bill Conti, who also did The Karate Kid, gives a great musical score. I recommend this to people from Georgia to New York to Los Angeles!!!
B000006TRV|5.0|This is a 2 disc concept album by Pink Floyd released in 1979, about a rock star's life, his decent into madness, and the consequences. This is an exploration of life's pressures, and tragedies that can cause someone to snap. Every song is good, as they can stand on their own, but when all together they tell the story. The music is great, played very well, with great solos, drumming, and keyboards. There is also some good acoustic tracks as well. The sound quality is also top notch. You can hear every instrument very clearly. This is another classic from Pink Floyd. If your ready for a trip into a personal hell, with great classic rock music, it doesn't get better than this. 5 stars. Also check out the film based on this.
B000002NIW|3.0|After buying the surprisingly enjoyable White Pony i thought i should check out thier earlier work to see what i've been missing. While there are some flashes of greatness on this album (be quiet and drive, mascara, the title track, mx) i find most of the songs just prod along aimlessly with the same thick wall of screeching guitar fuzz all the way through. Chino's vocals have alot of energy and emotion here but have little range to keep it interesting.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is one of the best films I've seen. It deals with so many things, and made in such an artistic way, its no surprise it was named the number one film. See this film! Its about a newspaper publisher named Kane, who becomes world famous, and his situations in life. Everyone wants to know about him and whats going on with him. He dies, and everyone wants to know the meaning of his last word on earth: Rosebud. A journalist is assigned to interview everyone who was close with Kane to find out about him and the meaning of his last word. We then are taken back throughout his life, and shown how someone can be so many different things to different people. This film also deals with what love, money, and being famous, mean to us as humans. This film has so much in it to discuss and study and reflect upon. If your into that, then I suggest you watch this film, if not, then just watch it for an interesting story. I'm sure you will get something meaningful out of it. 5 stars. Check it out.
B000021XR5|3.0|I really hated this album when i first heard it, it seemed like it had no direction or inspiration, and that they were just trying anything to get back into the mainstream. Most of the songs left a bad taste in my mouth. So i packed this album away into my closet for over a year. It was only a week ago i stumbled across this album in my closet, so ofcourse i gave it another try. I was pleasently surprised. This album has alot of diversity, it has STP's possibly 2 heaviest songs, 'Down' and 'No way out', both are as good as anything on Core, and also STP's poppiest ever songs 'Sour girl' and 'I got you' both with beautiful instrumentation. Whatever style of rock STP play they execute it perfectly with great melody. 'Sex and violence and 'MC5' are super catchy punk songs. If anything drags this album down it's Mr weiland, his lyrics are incredibly simplistic and repetitive. Thank god the Deleo's can write hooks like (...) Individually the songs on this album are top notch, unfortunately it doesnt flow too well as an album.
B00003CX8T|5.0|This has got to be my favorite disney movie of all time.  I love how there is such a variety in the tempo of each of the songs. Each of the characters is one you can easily love or hate as the case may be.  The sequels follow up on this quality also.
0920668372|4.0|This is a great story. The storyline is decodable and predictable, and a great story to get a childs attention. For my kindergarteners, I love the story because it teaches them about change. Some of my students believe they will be five years old forever. What a great attitude. You can use this concept of change, and bring it into the concept of time, days of the week, months of the year, seasons, and themselves- \\"All About Me.\\" This book was given to my son on his first birthday by my mother, so, I was pretty choked up when I read it. I was ready for the tears when Dr. Jeff Lee had a student in our Education Technology class read it to us. Since I know more about his connection with you, Mr. Munsch, the story is now a part of my life. I will now be closer to \\"Love You Forever\\" than I had been. Thank you for your gift to education and the heart. Bruce Ridill
B00005ARDC|4.0|Some people hear a lot of the Jesus &amp; Mary Chain in this band - I find more psychedelic sounds in this album - I was heavily reminded of early Blue Oyster Cult (especially the photos in the album sleeve) and Pink Floyd with some of The Doors for good measure more than anything else (&quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; via Southern California and you've got it).  This is not a bad thing.  Say what you want about BRMC being derivative, this is damn good rock &amp; roll and a style of it that has been out of the public eye for too, too long
1573222038|5.0|Sarah Waters has two previous books, TIPPING THE VELVET and AFFINITY, but this is by far her best. What she does with the characters and the plot are brilliant. It's one of those books that you stay up late at night with a flashlight reading, and as you near the end you slow down because you don't want it to end.<br />It just got nominated for the Booker Prize, which is very exciting. Great writing, amazing story, and simply fabulous. This is the first author in a long time that I wholeheartedly support--buying numerous copies to give as gifts, as well as talking her up every chance I get. She deserves all of the raves and the success.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|How could a film about Muhammad Ali be so excruciatingly slow, dull, and boring? Right from the word go, Michael Mann subjects the viewer to a string of pointless, drawn-out scenes which have about as much direction as a music video (indeed, this film has an ever-present soundtrack). This is one film that really feels like it's going nowhere. Will Smith's Ali is also a very muted character. When Ali's famous words, \\"No Viet Cong ever called me 'nigger',\\" come out, in what feels more like an impersonation of Mike Tyson than Muhammad Ali, the film has created little context to give such a bold statement any force.<br />Perhaps having seen many times the excellent documentary film, \\"When We Were Kings,\\" had an effect on how I viewed Mann's film. Despite its limited running time and narrower scope, When We Were Kings has a clear plot, creates a real sense of occasion, and leaves you with a stronger impression of who Ali was. It would be fair to say I was expecting something similar from Mann's film but with a wider scope. Whatever Mann's \\"Ali\\" was trying to be, it is a film that is not worthy of its subject.
B000066NW0|2.0|I was intrigued by the hit song Complicated, so I decided to buy this album to hear more.  Boy was I disappointed.  To be fair, the target audience of this album is probably teenage girls and women in their early 20's so I should not be surprised that I disliked it.  Despite the harsh music and airhead lyrics, there remains the fact that Avril Levigne has a mediocre voice at best.  I swear I have heard people in kareoke bars sing better than her and in a couple of songs I actually thought she was tone-deaf.  I don't know how she got her break-surely there are more talented aspiring singers out there?  Does anyone think she would have made the top 5 in American Idol?  No, this album isn't complicated, its overrated.
B00005YXZH|2.0|That's the best quick description I can think of for this boring album.  So many people recommended it to me that I went out and bought it without hearing a single track.  Now I've listened all the way through a couple of times and I don't see what all the fuss is about.  Take a lead singer with a deep, monotonous voice, some accoustic guitar, and combine them with meaningless lyrics and some sound effects that could have come from an early 1970's Pink Floyd album, and this is the result.<br />On the other hand, the packaging was pretty nice - worth an extra star right there.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This album has all the ingredients to be great: a variety of good music that is at times jazz-like or blues, good lyrics that keep your interest, and the wonderful voice of Norah Jones.  She has a very unique voice that sounds smoky and sultry and it reminds me of the late Eva Cassidy.  I think she could make a toothpaste jingle sound soulful and sexy.  The maturity she conveys, at the age of 22, is amazing compared with other young singers like Vanessa Carleton and Avril Levigne.  This has rapidly become one of my favorite albums and I highly recommend it.
B000068TPN|5.0|It is difficult to see what one could add to the reviews of over 200 others on Amazon.  Let me say that the DVD in particular, with the additional comments, puts this motion picture in the top 10 of all time.  It shows the early days of the Vietnam War from many perspectives, officers, soldiers, girlfriends, wives, and the man who wrote the book upon which the movie is based.  I wouldn't dare compare the two.  Suffice it to say, this film WILL change your mind about Vietnam, whether you were for, against, or neutral.  Also, given the actor and actresses involved, this movie could NOT have been made even 10 years ago--and we're the better for it.  For example, we BELIEVE that Mel Gibson is a devout religious and family man, and this adds to his portrayal.  We BELIEVE in Madeleine Stowe's portrayal as wife and mother, and she brings great conviction to the part.<br />For veteran and nonveteran alike, and for all those under 45s who really didn't know what the threat of being drafted for this \\"police action\\" was all about, and how it altered the lives of those senior to you, I recommend this film, highly, without hesitation, and strongly.
B00000JCRH|5.0|i have listened to just about every Metallica album, but this one is by far the best. great guitars, awesome lyrics, and slammin drums. if you buy this album, you will want to buy all of the other Metallica albums. the BEST song on the cd is the title track, Master Of Puppets. it has some of the best guitars i have ever heard anyone play.
0780622553|4.0|It was a scary movie to me. I felt uncomfortable and on edge throughout the movie!
0140367357|4.0|This book is about Cyril, Anthea, Robert, Jane, and their baby brother who discover a Psammead, <BR>or Sand-fairy, who agrees to grant the children one wish per day.<BR>Soon, their wishes start to turn quite unlike what they expected.<BR>Then, an accidental wish has terrible consequences, and the kids<BR>are faced with a hard choice: to let an innocent man be charged<BR>with a crime, or to lose their gift of magical wishes.<br />I read this book in one day, and I thought it was pretty good.<BR>This book turned out to be fairly interesting. <BR>I would probably read \\"Five Children and It\\" again.
B00005JKG5|3.0|Does anyone take note of Cynthia Rhodes in this movie? She's the blonde they call \\"Tina Tech\\". She also had roles in the movies Dirty Dancing and Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever. Talk about a dancer! She was magnificent!!! Whatever happened to her anyway?
B00005JKYI|3.0|FOOTLOOSE brings back a lot of great memories -- I loved this movie in high school, played the soundtrack a million times, and have wondered for several years why this movie wasn't available on DVD.<br />Now Paramount underwhelms us again with a very disappointing DVD release.  While at least we get a widescreen presentation and a 5.1 channel audio mix, that's ALL we get.  Period.  Were this a [$] budget release, I could understand the lack of extra features, but this is a full-price DVD!<br />At the very least, I would like to have seen the music videos for songs on the soundtrack included as bonus material.  An audio commentary from the director/cast would have been great.  A behind-the-scenes documentary, interviews with the cast, ANYTHING!!!<br />But we must remember that this comes from Paramount, the studio that doesn't like the DVD format.  I suppose we should be grateful to see any Paramount films on DVD at all...
B00000F1D3|4.0|This triumphant return to the charts for Cher definitely qualifies her for the status of &quot;legendary pop songstress&quot;.  She has always been unique through working with her voice and developing an unique style, dramatic and ironic.  Nowadays, she's going a slightly different path, but most fans should be well pleased.<br />&quot;Believe&quot; of course is the cornerstone and the starting point for this CD.  The best of the following songs are at the forefront and while they are in the same mode as the title song, &quot;The Power&quot;, &quot;Runaway&quot;, &quot;All Or Nothing&quot;, and &quot;Strong Enough&quot; each are great and individual cuts.  Admittedly, the energy seems to go downward with &quot;dove'e L'amore&quot; and the last four tracks, but it's still Cher and that isn't bad.<br />This album and the subsequent &quot;Living Proof&quot; present us with a gal who seems a bit happier and less sardonic and ironic with her material than in the earlier days.  Indeed, there has been a change, but we, her fans from the early days, have experienced change too and this is a very rewarding addition to one's collection.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I bought Sehnsucht first, and liked that, then got Herzeleid. I started out liking Sehnsucht first, then reverted to the darker sound of Herzeleid. I hung out for Mutter and finally got it, and to be completely honest I haven't played Herzeleid since.<br />This album is stunning. It is art. It is poetic in its compexity and eclecticism. It destroys all perspective and draws you in. Rammstein have dropped the almost techno like pop sound of Sehnsucht for a more varied and beautiful opus.<br />Mein Herz brennt is first off the mark, a sweeping, driving, velvety display of their growing talent. Bonus points for the orchestra - it creates an awesome atmospheric effect. Ich will addictive in its arrogant, blatant disregard. A very sexy track. Mutter is both beautiful and gratifyingly funny. Spieluhr is the catchiest tune here, put together very nicely. The album closes with a haunting poem, Nebel, which leaves you mytified and wondering.<br />In short: get this or miss out.
0767819659|4.0|I bought this DVD for my 3 year old neice and she loves it!  If you have young relatives, or children of your own, this DVD is great.  It is not too long, and it is a great break for any fan of Madeline.  My neice Taylor gave this DVD 4 stars!  That is better than my recommendation.
B00006F7S4|5.0|this disc is by far the best thing beck has ever done.  for those of you who think this album might be a joke, the joke's on you.  his collage-like pastische albums of the past were the joke and full of humor.  this is an album of serious contemplation and emotional exploration by a former teenage wunderkind who has started to mature albeit painfully.  it probably won't do to put this disc on at a rave as there's nothing superficial, danceable or repetitive about it.  in fact, it's a recording that should be listened to by people while NOT intoxicated so that you can grow up...if possible.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This album plays like a dream.  I can listen to it in various moods, and get a ton of enjoyment from it in any mood.  Are you up for a road trip?  Great CD.  Are you up for lounging reading a book?  Great CD.  Are you wanting to have background music that will catch everyone's attention at a party?  Great CD.  Do you want to be exposed to some sweet bluegrass music?  Great CD.  Do you want to remember the classic movie, O Brother Where Art Thou?  Great CD.<br />Any way you stack it this is a great CD all the way through.  There is not one song I do not enjoy on a regular basis.<br />Highlights Include:<br />Big Rock Candy Mountain - Harry McLintock<br />You Are My Sunshine - Norman Blake<br />Down In The River To Pray - Alison Krauss<br />I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow - The Soggy Bottom Boys<br />I'll Fly Away - Gillian Welch &amp; Alison Krauss<br />Allision Krauss is new to me, but since this album I am sold on her.<br />I highly recommend this album, you will not find yourself dissapointed in any way.
B00003CXCQ|2.0|I am an avid Disney fan, but that doesn't mean I love all of them, and Snow White is one that I will never like. It is average when Snow White remains silent, but when she talks I must admit to cringing. I give it two stars for the animal characters (I always liked the turtle) and Grumpy (the rest of the Dwarfs kind of freak me out). Also another thing that annoys me is that Snow White falls in love with the Prince after meeting him for two seconds (and kissing a bird) at a well, I don't think they even exchanged one real word, Cinderella had more contact than that with her Prince and that was pretty minimal. It really is the worst of the Princess movies, which I feel is too bad because it was the first and I really wish that I could like it, but I really can't.
B00005U11Z|1.0|Journey- Steve Perry= a joke. Somebody should sue for false advertising. I'm a huge Journey fan and would not go see this Journey cover band if they were playing in my basement. Shame on all of these greedy people who used to play in Journey.
B00005JL96|5.0|This movie has been criticized because of the broken family that is included.  I found that this was a realistic representation of how it can be difficult to maintain the family in the face of adversity.  This movie had a positive message and was a great movie.  This movie was action packed with some sci-fi aspects and probably could scare some younger children under 6.  It is nonetheless a great movie with some very positive and uplifting aspects.
0316666343|5.0|This is a book that I couldn't put down and stayed with me for days. Told from the point of view of a young girl who was murdered and looking down to earth from &quot;her heaven&quot;,  it is poignant,funny and heartbreaking all at once.
1565115503|4.0|I think it is worth buying. Your personal preference will affect how you like this version as opposed to the newer one done by the BBC. This is the first rendition I ever heard of the Lord of the Rings. I own both copies and I don't regret owning either one because each Version is good for different reasons. <BR>The voices are different in this version. BBC sounded more like grown men. The voices sounded more elfish in this version. I think that it reminded me of the Ralph Bashki version of the Hobbit. I did feel that this was more concise and less was edited out. Gollum seemed less psycho and scary in this version. There was less music in this version and less of a romantic sideline. I liked that it didn't edit out the part of Tom Bombadil; as BBC's version did. I felt like more was cut out on the BBC version even though it was four cds longer. It was disappointing.<BR>I know that one person found this edition hard to follow. I find all the audio I listen to has to be listened to repeatedly to understand the plot. I will admit that this is the kind of story that one has to listen to to understand all that was going on. With repeated listenings; one hears new things or notices new things. I actually found the narration and actors voices sounded clearer in this version than the later one.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Miramar & Disney, why don't you respect the audience and allow them to watch the uncut, original version instead of your edited Americanised version?  What's next?  Cutting a couple of movements in Vivaldi's Four Seasons because it's not fast paced enough?  Respect the audience, respet the author, show the real thing.

B00000G3PA|5.0|I really liked this movie. It has great special effects a lot of momentum, action and emotions on a worldwide scale as well as personal. If in real life we would come across a situation like the one epicted in this movie, we would have no chance. Overall the movie is not as scientifically correct as it might seem at first but it is not that bad either. I really liked this movie.
0316666343|5.0|Like most others who have read Lovely Bones, I found it difficult to stop reading until I reached it's end.  I agree with the Psychologist's review here that Susie's character is hard to believe at times as her rather insightful, mature observations clash with her tender age.  However, Susie is observing the events on Earth from Heaven and is given the luxury of 20/20 &quot;present&quot; sight. Since she is removed from the living world, she is able to mull over and analyze those everyday actions whose consequences sometimes keep us awake at night.  Despite the character flaws in Lovely Bones, I would highly recommend it as an elevating read (especially in the wake of last year's events) for those who ponder the afterlife and have the courage to imagine (and hope for)a heaven that Susie resides in.
B00000ILE6|5.0|I love these movies. I had nightmares for a week after I saw Aliens 2 in 1986. Special effects are awesome on all of them, tension and momentum are high and acting is good. Overall: EXCELLENT
B000002MUQ|3.0|\\"Balance\\" was an album I absolutely hated when it first came out in early 1995.  Grunge/alternative was in full swing and I expected Van Halen to deliver some good dumbed-down arena rock to take me away from all the plodding, whiny, self-important tripe being put out in that era.  Instead, I got Van Halen's most intellectual album to date, with a lot of moody pieces that seemed to be trying to mimic the climate of the times.  Over time though I grew to like it somewhat, although I think it is still pretty low on my list of favorite VH albums.  <br />Ironically, the two songs that qualify as dumbed-down arena rock, \\"Big Fat Money\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" are actually the weakest on the album.  Musically, \\"Amsterdam\\" is an excellent (if predictable) VH song, but the lyrics - \\"Wam bam, oh Amsterdam, stones you like nothing else can\\" - pure poetry there, Hagar.  And \\"Big Fat Money\\" is just plain lame on all levels.  Van Halen proved they could do quasi-speed metal with \\"Get Up\\" from \\"5150\\", but this is just a sloppy mess.  In press interviews for promoting this album Hagar described \\"Big Fat Money\\" as \\"this album's `Panama' or `Why Can't This Be Love',\\" but let me tell you, he was just plain WRONG.   <br />\\"Can't Stop Loving You\\", as the title suggests, is equally trite but this one works well.  It's unashamedly pop, with a chime-sounding guitar tone similar to Def Leppard's later work.    <br />Keyboards are intentionally low key here, with only the organic ballad \\"Not Enough\\" getting a bit of piano treatment.  \\"Not Enough\\" is hardly the best ballad VH has ever done, but it's at least a nice change from the synth-heavy stuff they had been churning out since the \\"1984\\" days.  \\"Take Me Back\\" is another stripped-down ballad that works well. <br />\\"Aftershock\\" has a verse similar to the 1970 R&B tune \\"Get Ready\\" by Rare Earth.  Beyond that, it's a pretty by-the-numbers VH tune, meaning it blows away virtually everything by any other band of a similar ilk, but it's still got a been-there-done-that feel to it.  <br />\\"Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)\\" is your basic heady-lyrics song, supposedly inspired by the suicide of Kurt Cobain.  It was a decent first single, but not among Van Halen's finest work.<br />The rest of it - \\"Seventh Seal\\", \\"Feelin'\\", and the three (?!?) instrumentals \\"Baluchiterum\\", \\"Doin' Time\\" and \\"Strung Out\\" all fill things out nicely, but overall this is a rather unspectacular VH album.  Better than \\"OU812\\", \\"Van Halen 3\\", and I would probably even hold it up against \\"Van Halen II\\" (my least favorite disc from the Roth years), but it was a pretty big letdown after the wait for something new and exciting in the midst of all the dreary and depressing grunge all over the radio in 1995.
B00004XPOZ|5.0|This trilogy is the ultimate in pure sci-fi. It was, it is and it will be the almighty of sci-fi movies to the end of time. Overall: HOLY.
6304994540|5.0|Another mastrpiece of big brothers. Amasing performance, characters, plot, dialogs...everything. I saw this movie probabaly 20-25 times, but it`s still very enjoyable to me. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, John Tarturo, German gang and others are OUTSTANDING! One of the best picture I`ve ever seen in my life. BRAVO!!
0812550757|4.0|I bought this novel with a little trepidation.  There were, in my mind, some glaring story holes revealed in the synopsis of the book, and I just did not see that there was anything to add to the story told in Ender's Game.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br />What I found was much more than Ender's Game.  Indeed, it is obvious from this story (and the foreword) that Speaker was the book Card was working on when he wrote EG.  EG was the back-story necessary for the real meat of Ender Wiggins, Speaker for the Dead.  The most disturbing point that drew me away from buying Speaker was that it takes place 3000 years after Ender drops the last bomb on the buggers.  Surprisingly, this is resolved neatly and without too much need for suspension of disbelief.  In short, thank Einstein.<br />The story itself examines Ender's redemption of his participation in the Xenocide within the context of First Contact with the piggies.  The piggies are sufficiently different, both biologically and socially, to be a fascinating mystery, and understanding their differences prompts the introspection necessary to consider why other cultures on this planet choose to do things that seem so irrational.<br />It is a very moving story with characters that (mostly) act with 3d realism.  A surprising number of characters are sketched in detail that clearly distinguishes them from each other.  This is no small accomplishment for an author.  One of the high points is Ender's speech as the Speaker for the Dead.  In it he speaks for a deceased man who the community almost universally regards as a mean-spirited worthless drunk.  However, when Ender reveals the dead man's perspective of his own life, you get the sense that we should take care in our judgments of others.<br />With four stars its not surprising that there are some problems.  The first - far too much Portuguese.  All the Portuguese words and names interfere with a smooth read, and just do not seem necessary.  If we were reading a story thattook place in France, sure throw the French at me, but not out here where it adds nothing to feel of the book.<br />The other problem is that a huge portion of the plot hinges on the irrational concealment of a biological discovery.  The character that hides this discovery acts so out of character in doing so, that it is obviously a weak plot device the author hoped to just \\"slip in\\" without our notice. This turn does not ruin the book, in fact most of the better aspects of this novel turn on this point, but I do wish Card could have found a better way to achieve it.<br />I especially enjoyed the forword included in the version that I read.  This bit in particular is great reading for would-be writers, but should be left until after finishing the story as it reveals too many clues to the plot.<br />All in all it is a very good read, and recommeded for any SCI/FI fan.
630416923X|5.0|I lived one of the happiest days of my life one Sunday afternoon, in july 1967, when the Fab Four appeared on TV recording \\"All You Need Is Love\\", live from England. By then I was only 16 and it was impossible to conceive that one day you could own those unforgettable scenes on a recorded tape! It was almost a 30 year long delay to have the chance to treasure them in your home and reproduce them as many times as you wish. One day the joy came to an end, when my number 7 tape (where the song is included) stopped working properly. You may ask why I didn't buy another one. The answer is: This is \\"DVD Era\\", I don't want to live the same trauma again with untrustworthy VHS cheap tapes! I thought: \\"Soon I will be able to get them on DVD format\\". But I'm getting older and older and I still can't have my \\"All You Need Is Love\\" scenes back on DVD: Maybe \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\".....
B00006F7S4|5.0|That's it, i've had it with you people who think you understand music but won't  allow a musician to grow......if you want to hear odelay, go to your cd case and pull it out! it's right there between your papa roach and  sugar ray albums.This is not a depressing album, it's beautiful and energized.  It's in the spirit of great songwriters like nick drake, alex chilton, and tim buckley who were able to turn a feeling into a melody, then a word ,then a song.  Tim buckley started referring to his \\"fans\\" as lobo's (lobotomy) after they started wining about not hearing the goodbye and hello stuff anymore, i'm sure beck has a simillar term for you.
0671027344|5.0|I loved the entire book. Start to finish, every once and awhile I would forget that this book is fictional. I find myself wanting to find this kid and be his friend. This book also hits home with many problems that older teens like me face. Truly a classic, a must read for everyone.
B00006BTCA|4.0|All hail the new Caesar. Mastering and conquering the sound of distant bands, our four heroes march into the hallowed halls amongst much pomp and circumstance; banners waving, flags unfurled, accolades all around, glory, just a beat away. This iconoclastic moment echoes, tasting like forever. The spirit and soul of music past is alive and well. With victory at hand, these young men take their place in history. Like a Viking ship landing on our foggy shores just before new dawn. Brandishing guitar swords, moving on the sleeping villages below, the message will be delivered - sung and played unto the masses. Look out.
B000001EMW|1.0|I am a huge Metallica fan, but this CD is terrible.  Simply put, Metallica is not to be played on classical instruments.  I am now beginning to think that the Metallica crew are simply looking for more ways to fatten their wallets (which, of course, they could do by producing good, NEW music, instead of recycling old stuff... But alas, that would require work!)
B00005JL78|5.0|Over the past few years we have been hounded by bad future cop movies like (Time Cop, and The One) but where those movies failed this one succeeds with a half way decent plot, good acting, and great directing Minority Report scores a hit and takes audiences on a fantastic journey through the future. It is nice to finally see a future movie done well
B00003CWL5|5.0|This is the greatest movie out<BR>it's about a man with a useless life who sets out to change his life forever ... and quits his highly paid job to work at a fast food outlet. This is a move for anyone who wonders if their is any depth behind your average family seeing thi you'll definetly think so.
B00005OM4K|5.0|This is an excellent set through and through... Main reason I am writing this review is to say to not overlook the Pre-Creedence CD. In my opinion it is just as good as any of the others, especially &quot;Walking On The Water.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|No words can describe this awesome Film!!!!!Don't rent it!!! Buy it!!!!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|This is the record that really emphasizes everything that is Hard Rock. Simply, put the most talented musicians and songwriters in one band, make them write the best record ever, and you get AFD. Steve's drums are huge and pounding. Slash's and Izzy's guitars bring down the hardest, loudest, and best riffs of the genre. Duff adds that punk bass sound, the perfect low end, and Axl's voice is just amazing, from the nasal tones of Mr. Brownstone to the screaming You Are Crazy. This is an escencial album for rock fans. Certified platinum about 15 times is a proof of how this is one classic. Hard songs such as Welcome To The Jungle, punk as It's So Easy, bluesy such as Mr Brownstone, ballads like Sweet Child O' Mine. This is simply a perfect album. I sincerely wouldn't see anything to change in it. Can't wait for Axl to be back, I'm counting the days for seen him live: 11/14/02. Higlights: everything, Lowlights: it's only like an hour long, I wish it'd be 2 or 3 hours.
1559409002|4.0|So much has been written about this film over the years that I refuse to over-do it. To keep it simple, this is a low budget independently amateur effort about death that actually works. It works because the low budget just enhances the overall nightmarish quality. The heroine is a church organist who \\"survives\\" a fatal car accident and attempts to resume her life only to find she is haunted by specters of death. Creepy organ music permeates the b&w film throughout. The atmosphere is beautifully built up to eerie effect especially the on location shooting around a deserted carnival where the specters dance at night. This truly strange tale is best to watch late at night with the lights off and maybe a candle or two. I would also recommend turning a friend on to this who has never seen it. Just tell them it's a REALLY WEIRD MOVIE and that just about sums it up. It's wonderful to have it on DVD but stick with the Image or Criterion versions for quality and avoid the cheaper discs.
B00003003R|5.0|If you liked Appetite and needed more. Here is the ultimate Gn'R collection. Two albums with the best hits of Gn'R, mostly concentrated on AFD and Gn'R Lies. The guitars are raw and hard, Axl's voice sounds all right. The album makes you wish you were at the concerts. Knocking on Heaven's Door is turned into the ultimate live song by the band. Other hits such as Welcome To The Jungle, You could Be Mine, Sweet Child O' Mine, Don't Cry, sound great live. Thanks God for bringing Gn'R back live in 2002.<BR>I highly suggest it if you are a rock fan. highlight: Knocking On Heaven's Door interlude, lowlight: Move to the City interlude
0553573411|4.0|The continuing adventures of Fitzchivalry Farseer, as the Royal Assassin, is as good, if not better than the first. The Red Ship raiders continue and even step up the raids. During this period, we see Fitz grow into a young man.<br />His world crumbles and grows at the same time, forcing an interesting combination of attributes in the protagonist of the story. The mark of a good story is the interest it inspires in its characters. Hobb did a very good job with this.<br />The relationships Fitz develops do well to illustrate the depth of character evident in even the antagonists of the tale. From the wisdom and skill of Chade to the views of Regal.<br />Throughout the book, one sees growth and wonders where it will go, and after the conclusion, one wonders what if it had gone another way. The interaction of characters, the responses recorded by Fitz, and the further development of the magics of this world make this an enjoyable read.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys a tale, though it is a bit long for light reading.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives have been getting a lot of media attention recently in part because of the string of bands that everyone keeps grouping together (The Hives, The Vines, The Strokes). Beside the ever-present 'The', each band has their own sound. <BR>In every Hives song you can hear every instrument. There is never one that dominates the song. As in most rock music guitar is prominent but not dominate which is awesome. The Hives use a lot of sharp guitar sounds that blend perfectly with Pelle Almquist's (lead vocals) cracking voice. <BR>This is the type of music that you can't sit still to. There's only one slow song on the entire album (Find Another Girl) and even that rocks. They remind me of the Ramones (though they are of course incomparable, The Ramones that is) but never the less the music and anthem esque songs (my own personal anthem being Main Offender) make me want to listen to the Ramones.<BR>I was at first turned off by them because of the hype and the cult like concerts (in which Pelle seems to want everyone to worship the band) but know I'm checking for they're next show.
B00006FXB6|2.0|Okay, I originally gave this album 2 stars, but after listening to it over the past 2yrs, it's grown on me big-time. Better than \\"Rated R\\" and ALMOST as good as their self-titled debut, I'm now giving it 4 stars. And I highly recommend it to any true rock fan!
B00004XMV6|5.0|Why did she go see Mr. Farnsworth and why did we need to see that? You find that out at the end. They connect because they something in common: They are both in over their heads and very much &quot;fish out of water&quot;. Look for the cues. They are there throughout the entire movie.<br />The dialog between John and Elizabeth is important. But it's sometimes hard to hear and I think that's why people get a bit lost. It's a movie you need to watch more than once to fully undestand.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Amazing.  Simply amazing.  &quot;Pi&quot; was good work by Mansell, but &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; goes beyond anything I ever imagined.  The emotion in this music is almost overwhelming, beginning with the first track and ending with the last.  If you've seen the movie, the soundtrack is great to listen to because there is so much meaning in it, and if you haven't seen the movie the soundtrack will just make you want to.  Buy this CD now!
B00005YW4H|4.0|In my experience, jazz music is an acquired taste. Because the majority of music listeners are not accustomed to hearing the melodies of jazz vocalists and musicians, it can be a bit hard to digest for someone who typically listens to pop music. The initial reaction is that you want to dislike jazz because it's too slow, or too sad or for whatever reason - but when you stop and reflect for a moment there is much to find and appreciate. My first reaction to Norah Jones was negative. I appreciate jazz music, but she's so young. I knew she had to be some phony crossover artist. Man, I was wrong!<br />This album is really beautiful. The radio hit, \\"Don't Know Why,\\" showcases Jones's subtle, moody vocals and accomplished jazz piano playing, which makes her sound years more mature than 23. \\"Don't Know Why\\" is soft and seductive without being overly sexual, which is a theme that runs throughout the whole album. \\"Come Away With Me\\" reminds me of a lullaby. It's endearing, child-like, and it just sounds sweet. \\"Turn Me On\\" has an almost country feel, and \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" is one of those songs that you wish there was more of. It's darkly lovely and stands out as a highlight. \\"The Nearness Of You\\" reminds me of summer mornings - lying in bed, relaxed, and just being lazy. It's also evocative of old-school jazz legends like Billie Holiday and Etta James.<br />The rest of the tunes on CAWM aren't as good, but still pleasant enough. I think the only real low point of the album is that Jones has a beautiful voice, but she's never going to blow you away. She has range, but doesn't use it that much and stays pretty mellow. In some ways, that's good, because she doesn't come off as a pushy overachiever (an easy trap for a vocalist to fall into on a debut), but I would still be interested in hearing more of her singing talents on the next album.<br />The bottom line is that Norah Jones isn't some flash-in-the-pan, one hit wonder pretty girl who pretends to be a jazz artist.I encourage anybody who thinks that to give this album a chance. Within its walls lies a talented woman whose love for jazz shines through in a big way.
6304366078|5.0|The #1 greatest racing movie ever made, Grand Prix was a very experimental film using brand new camera angles, new technologies, great story telling, and incredible insight into the greatest form of motorsport. Sure any jerk stomp the gas and go in a straight line its not about the driver its about the car, and you can teach a child to drive in a circle like those redneck NASCAR wimps. F1 is what driving is all about - the DRIVING not the car, not the TV exposure, not the fame - just pushing yourself as hard as you can - lots of turns, lots of shifts - driving because you love doing it. In this particular time period (late 60s) all the cars were rear mount engine rear wheel drive, 2.0 litre V8. Itdidnt matter who made it that was the league limit. Matching all the cars to see who was the better DRIVER. Also with a production team of experienced drivers you come out with famous insightful quotes like<br />&quot;For three years I was world motorcross champion, I thought nothing could be better. Then I got in a car. You sit in a box surrounded by gasoline, like being inside a coffin, but of course you go faster and that is what's most important&quot;<br />&quot;I think if any of us ever imagined - i mean REALLY imagined - what it would be like to hit a tree at 120 miles an hour none of us would ever get in the cars.

B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park's new CD, Reanimation, is fantastic. However, to compare it to Hybrid Theory (HT) is impossible. I have both. Personally I think everyone should. You can't buy one or the other: they complement eachother like you can't believe.<BR>The best part of the new CD is the song collection.<BR>Enth E Nd (In The End) was one of the best tracks on HT, but it has been reworked and made into a totally rocking new tune. REVISED<BR>By_Myslf (By Myself) was (I think) a weaker song on HT, but Josh Abraham and Mike Shinoda combine to make a new background beat that really improves the song. IMPROVED<BR>P5hng Me A*Wy (Pushing Me Away) almost seems as if Linkin Park threw out the old song and made a new one. This beat is just like a new one, but the traces of the original are catchy and unmistakable. REANIMATED<br />Get both CDs. I think Reanimation is better, but I can't see anyone enjoying it without having heard the originals first. If you are the type of person who reads a sequel before the first book, consider buying this. If you only read from the beginning (like me) get both. If you already have Hybrid Theory, GET THIS ALBUM.<br />It is without a doubt as new an album as Hybrid Theory, and don't be concerned that it will be a waste because it will be repetetive. It isn't. This is  fantastic effort, and well worth 5 stars. Even the jewel case is cool!<br />FIVE STARS. OUTSTANDING.

006097625X|5.0|A very unusual book from McCloud, the writer/artist of the comic Zot! In fact, I'm amazed that McCloud doesn't have a more extensive bibliography, given the wealth of information and insight presented in this volume. Succinctly, this book explains how comics work. Not how they are made, per se, but why the sequential images of a comic are an art form different from books or TV. And McCloud accomplishes this using the very medium he is examining.<br />I'm a comics fan that stopped buying them because they were putting me in the poor house. McCloud here explained to me how I was initially sucked in by the medium and why I kept reading some of the \\"worst\\" examples even while my artistic tastes were changing in other media. While I doubt that I could recreate the same Glen Cox who once wrote letters to comics, I can now reconcile myself with the Glen who still enjoys Howard the Duck and Cerebus (not to mention Zot!).<br />My friend Phil Yeh has been on a literacy campaign for over five years now, and he gives the following reason for why he dedicated himself to it. He said that he saw the literacy figures for America, and the downward trend, and realized that he was losing more and more of his audience. He felt that the American disdain for comics was missing the point--children who read comics are still reading. Although McCloud makes a strong case for the comic being different from prose, I don't think that he would disagree. And, if the interplay between words and pictures keeps a child reading, what is wrong with that?
B00006GA4C|5.0|I fondly remember listening to FM radio in the 70's in the Philadelphia area.  One of my favorite's was a late night feature where they would play an entire album side uninterrupted.  Side 2 of Grand Funk has to be one of the best album sides in rock history, along with side 1 of Led Zeppelin IV, side 1 of Black Sabbath Paranoid, and side 1 of Rush 2112.<br />I inherited this cassette (yes, cassette!) from my brother in the early 70's.  I constantly played side 2 on my little tape player.  I eventually lost track of the cassette and GFR in the late 70's.  I've had the Capitol Collector Series for a while and recently purchased Bosnia, but didn't have any other GFR cd's.  When I saw they were remastering their catalogue, I knew I had to pick up the &quot;red album&quot;.  Wow, what a trip back in time.  The rawness and energy on this album is unmatched and, unfortunately, was lost on their later material.<br />Whether in your car, home, or at work with headphones, play this LOUD!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|Room for Squares shows everything thats wrong with the music industry.  First of all, its a great cd, having some very very good songs on it (Love Song for No One, Neon, 83, and my favorite 3x5).  However, all of the tracks have been overproduced and made to sound glib and poppy.  If you want to hear Mayer at his best, download some of his concerts (they are out there if you know where to look).  Then there are the fans.  I couldn't help but laugh at the reviewer who said they were a John Mayer fan for a few months cus they heard 'No Such Thing' on the radio and liked it, then they went out and bought the cd and discovered he played other songs.  He's been marketed to a pop audience that will probably be his demise, as it has to every other teeny-bopper band appealing to 13 year olds with &quot;I Love You&quot; sings at every concert.  Finally, there is Mayer himself.  More and more, he has proven himself to be cocky and arrogant about his music.  If he wants some real respect, he should have read the meaning of humbleness and modesty in the dictionary in school.  Despite all this, I do like the music, though I find myself listening to it less and less recently.  If only more bands could live up to their potential.<br />Oh and anyone who makes any comparison of him to Dave Matthews is fooling themselves.  Mayer is no where near the level of reaching that sort of musical talent and deep meaning.
B00005JKDR|3.0|Pretty darned good movie overall,but if it wasn't for 'BOO'the movie would have been a waste of time. Only in a Disney flik could one little kid cause so much trouble and be so cute doing it.
0316666343|4.0|I thought this book was disturbing and wonderful all at the same time. My heart ached for the parents and brother and sister left to find their way. It is definitely an original.
B000001ZS3|5.0|I've been looking for this album since leaving the <BR>army in '79. There are 10 synthesizers used to create this album<BR>and J.M.J plays them all! Heck, one of the tracks was even used in the footrace scene with Mel Gibson in the movie Gallipoli. So if you're into electronic music you definetly need to add this album to your collection.
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen fans usually divide into two - those who like the earlier, 70s style of Queen, and those who enjoy the 80s Euro-pop Queen. I fall into the former, and for those, this album represents the height of their career and creative powers. It is not a moody rock album like Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. It does not try to be introspective. It does not try to be deep, although at many places it succeeds. It just has one thing in mind - to entertain you. This is evident from the first song, which has one of the greatest rock song openings out there, along with The Who's Baba Oriley and other greats. It then proceeds through 12 songs, some of them silly - but in an intelligent, Monty Python sort of way - some of them complex, some sad and some touching, but all vibrating with some sort of energy and enthusiasm that are evident even today, more than 25 years after the album has been released. Queen in fact managed to do what so many other artists are after - this is a progressive rock album, in terms of musical complexity, but without the progressive rock dullness found in so many other albums, because all the songs are so damn catchy! Personally this album had a very big influence on me and I easily put in on my shelf next to other rock greats such as The Wall, Led Zeppelin IV and others. I envy those who do not yet know it since they can now experience the magic of hearing it for the first time. Enjoy!
B00005JK8K|3.0|The only problem I had with this movie was the calling in for fire support.I have a hard time believing that artillery support in WWII would hit the target every time on the first round. Maybe once in the whole war you might call the coordinates so perfectly, but not every single time, not unless John Wayne was calling in the fire support. A little to much hollywood there. Other than that the movie was worth the ticket.
6305972591|5.0|OK. It's silly. I still like this film for it's flaws. Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton are reliable as the adult leads, and I'm usually appalled by bad kid-actors, but there are so many of them that I had a good time. One kid actor, Anne-Marie McEvoy (as Sarah) was believable.  This film starts out well, and really grabs you; after a while, the kids appear and make it a crazy exposition of silliness. The bland setting of Nebraska (actually, filmed in Iowa) adds to the initial interest. Credit must be given to director Fritz Kiersch for his great use of sets and creating a certain tension, and the music of Jonathan Elias (reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's THE OMEN) was effective. Still, there's no forgiving the performances of John Franklin (Isaac) and Courtney Gains (Malachi, who looks like a cross between Alfalfa & Eddie Haskell). They were so atrocious, but, mixed with all the other horrible kid-performances, it becomes a laff-fest. One kid, Amos (John Philbin), looks like a young Tom Cruise, and goes to his death with a toothy smile that's borderline corny (forgive the pun). The film is entertaining, as long as you don't take it seriously. It is based on a 15-page Stephen King story, but it kind of takes on a mystique of its own. The DVD version has a slight LBX which adds to some of the beautiful landscapes. Don't write this off; it's fun.
B000001IPP|5.0|Rancid is a classical example of good punk rock.Lets Go is one of the great albums in the Rancid cronicle. \\"Lets Go\\" has a great selection of songs which include Nihilism, Side Kick and Salvation. Rancid contains just the rght amounts of screaming and guitar rifs. With lots heavy bass play Rancid is a group that will have your car bouncing. But if you are going to get Lets Go you should probably get ...And Out Come the Wolves and Rancid which also contain a great selection of songs.
B000002AT6|5.0|In my opinion this is James Horner best soundtrack. I really think you should have this one. Most of the tracks make you imagine those never ending fields that appear in the movie.<BR>But tracks number 7 and number 13, are my favorites, absolutely beautiful.<BR>Like I said before if you like soundtracks you really should buy this one.
B00006AW2J|5.0|One of the Stones' very best.  And yes, it along with the other new Stones Reissues can be ripped.  Download the free version of MusicMatch Jukebox and it will work fine.  Disclaimer alert:  This is only to be used for legal purposes, mind you.  Otherwise great sound, and great material.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Sea Change, Beck's latest studio album is among the best albums of the year.  I've drawn this conclusion after numerous listens.  That's not to say that there haven't been some great albums to surface in 2002 (Liars, Interpol, Neko Case, 16 Horsepower, etc.), but I firmly believe this one sits near the top.  It's not experimental or bizarre; it's just a straightforward recording - the way albums used to be.  Over the last several years my musical tastes have become harder to pigeonhole because of the increasing number of artists who have created music that is basically \\"genre-defying.\\"  Beck could be considered one of those artists because he continuously has his hands in about twenty different types of music.  That's how it should be.  Music is a wonderful thing if done with compassion and integrity.  Besides, why limit yourself to one style when you're an extremely talented musician like Beck Hansen?  <br />Sea Change is a bit different from Beck's Midnite Vultures and Odelay sessions.  It's not a party album, and you definitely won't be able to pick up girls in a \\"tricked-out Hyundai\\" with it. Sea Change, rather, begins with my vote for the #1 song of the year, \\"The Golden Age.\\"  Introspection in songwriting doesn't get much better than this.  The gentle steel guitar and the echoing chorus have made me a Beck fan for life (not that I wasn't before).  It's even made me go back and re-listen to some of his previous material with a new ear.  \\"Paper Tiger\\" comes next with just an extremely subtle touch of funk.  It's another one of the better songs on the album.  It also happens to have some amazingly simple symphonic textures a la Scott Walker.  I believe Beck said his dad helped him with that portion of the album.  I could be wrong.  Continuing with the \\"broken-heart\\" theme is \\"Guess I'm Doing Fine.\\"  It's at this point you have either been sucked in by Beck's sorrow, or you have been shoved out the back door with a consolation prize.<br />As the album goes on, songs like \\"End of the Day\\" and \\"It's all in Your Mind\\" begin to put the listener in a lull that's nearly impossible to get away from.  To do so, you'd have to shut the album off and come back to it later.  If I were to say the album had a flaw, I would say that it simply gets hard to keep your attention due to the over-melancholic atmosphere these songs contain. <br />Overall, the musicianship on this album is phenomenal.  There will be plenty of people who will put this album down because it's very polished and not the least bit experimental.  That's fine by me.  Anyway, I'm tired of seeing all these \\"artists\\" with DAT recorders and chainsaws being hailed as the true pioneers of our time.  Who says music has to be way out in left field to be good?  Why not occasionally enjoy some of the more simple things in life?  Finally, remember that all music has its place in the industry.  While I don't agree with a lot of promotional fodder in the music industry, artists like Beck will continue to show us all that music will always come first. Sea Change represents that for me, and hopefully it will for you too.  Go out and get a copy for yourself.  You have four covers to choose from that have been done by the wonderful LA artist, Jeremy Blake.

0375414053|5.0|Allison Pearson somehow found the balance herself in this delightful first novel. It is at times laugh-out-loud funny and at other times strikingly deep. I walked away liking and admiring Kate and wishing this novel didn't have to end. Another wonderful debut to join the ranks of Alice Sebold's Lovely Bones and Kirk Martin's Shade of the Maple.
B000001FE0|5.0|Yes, I agree with another reviewer...this album is the Bee Gees' equivilant to The Beatles' white album. <br />Odessa is double the size of the Brothers Gibb's first three international releases, and has some fabulous music on it.  Some of their best singing is on these 2 discs (now conveniently stored on 1 compact disc). Many types of music is presented on this album including rock, soft ballads, country, and it contains a few classical-influenced instrumentals as well.<br />Highlights include the opening 7 minute title track opus, Marley Purt Drive, Melody Fair, Suddenly, and the semi-hit First of May. <br />Bottom Line: For some great early Bee Gees, along with their first album, I recommend this classic album.
B000067CPX|4.0|How do these guys keep doing it?  I was a little leary of having the album, but after hearing it a few times from friends I decided to go ahead and burn it.  Excellent effort.  I'm amazed at how different the Peppers manage to sound on every album.  Some people might argue that they all sound the same, but really, come on...this album sounds very unique compared to other treasures such as Blood Sugar... and Californication.  I can only thank god that the guys got to hook up with John F. again.  The chemistry just didn't seem the same without him.  I love Dave N., but it just wasn't the same.  If you're thinking about buying this album, I would say STOP!  Burn it!  Defenitely!  This album is a must have!  You just shouldn't have to go broke to enjoy all the good music you want to.  We have to go broke enough when we want to see these bands live.  Is 40 or 60 dollars reasonable when you want to see a great band?  I don't think so.  If I'm financially hurting any band by burning their CD, then I'll PAY to go see them, then I'll hand them the 1 or 2 dollars they might have made off of my CD sale royalty that they didn't get.  I think that's fair.

B00005QK3W|4.0|My first thought was \\"Paul's hurting.\\" You know, getting in touch with his feelings after his wife died, falling in love again. It's like he's thinking aloud musically. He does a few things here I've never heard him do; making this album less commercial than, say, Band on the Run. Sure, his bass and voice sound great. A sparse sound pervades the record. Second and third listens, I'm liking it more and more. It sounds more rich. But to me, the only problem overall is that there are few rockers; it's a relatively mellow, adult, grown-up album. \\"She's Given Up Talking\\" features his Liverpudlian humor and weirdness, but don't expect a \\"Ram\\"-type record here. Or, just jot down your favorite tracks and listen to them. 3.5 stars. Now go out and listen to \\"Run Devil Run.\\"
0446678430|4.0|Kiyosaki's inspirational, easy-to-read books are written to excite the reader about available financial opportunities.  And they do excite the reader. It is easy to get caught up in the author's enthusiasm.  The generalizations are great and allow the reader to dream, but more details are needed. In this recent book, Kiyosaki stresses the need to protect your assets.  He spends an entire chapter (17) on how stock options can, and in his opinion, should be used by all investors to gain that protection.  His discussion was convincing, but again, there were not enough details.  I recommend THE SHORT BOOK ON OPTIONS to learn those details. The reader would then be in position to follow Mr. Kiyosaki's good investment protecting advice.
B00006690G|5.0|... His \\"show\\" this time is all snarls, not cutting satire; Marshall Mathers is on the defensive now, and he's reeling from his mother (\\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\"), the price of fame (\\"When the Music Stops\\"), and the politics of his skin color (\\"White America\\"). Other than \\"Without Me,\\" which recycles the pop shots at the usual chart toppers and other white rappers, the only real target on the rapper's third album is himself -- the choices he's made (\\"Say Goodbye to Hollywood\\"), the relationships he's failed, the respect he still needs (\\"Say What U Say\\"). It's Em saying, \\"So you want to see what I'm really like?\\" -- whether his audience wants to see those demons or not. <br />On the tracks, Mathers is at the ol' crossroads. He and Dr. Dre are starting to repeat themselves on the likes of \\"Soldier,\\" \\"The Business,\\" and \\"The Drips,\\" and The Eminem Show lacks the overwhelming, single-minded force that The Marshall Mathers LP had. The best moments feel unique, yet somehow isolated from one another: \\"Square Dance\\" calls out his competition over a wild collision of synth drones and banjo; \\"Till I Collapse\\" sounds like a surging military march meeting Queen's \\"We Will Rock You\\"; \\"Sing for the Moment\\" is the album's \\"Stan,\\" a hip-hop power ballad reinvigorating Aerosmith's \\"Dream On.\\" <br />Still, there's something particularly endearing about Eminem's meek singing -- yes, singing -- on \\"Hallie's Song\\"; his true feelings can't be hid with a dis or an expletive, and he sounds as real rhapsodizing his daughter as on any of his best rhymes skewing pop culture. He says he's happy here -- and you almost want to believe it.<br />my favorite songs in the album:<BR>1.Business <BR>2.Cleanin Out My Closet<BR>3.Without Me <BR>4.White America <BR>5.Square Dance
0385040253|5.0|THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS (c.1944) by Clifford W. Ashley, is the definitive reference work on knots, splices, and ropework in general.  Born in 1881 in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Clifford W. Ashley was an antique dealer and artist, who spent eleven years writing his magnum opus, THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS, and died three years after its 1944 publication.<br />In his pursuit of ropework, Mr. Ashley spent six months at sea on the whaling bark SUNBEAM; and six weeks on a Delaware Bay oysterman called a 'bugeye'.  He interviewed tradesmen, such as: steeplejacks, cobblers, truckdrivers, butchers, electric linesmen, and boyscouts as well as sailors and sea captains to document each nuance of knot unique to its trade.  He was taught a few knots by Mr. Ringling himself of circus fame; and taught a knot to Mr. DuPont, a captain of industry.<br />The result of Mr. Ashley's research was a significant collection of 7,000 drawings of 3,900 knots and their application in a 620 page knot tyers tome which has become a veritable bible for rope workers the world over.  In just about any capacity that a rope can be utilized has found its way into THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS.  Mr. Ashley has covered: netting, lashings, block &amp; tackle, splices, hitches, and bends.  He went from purely decorative knots with no practical value to knots applied to industrial use.  He included a whole chapter on rope tricks and puzzles.  There is an amusing catalog of small figures the author drew to rate the quality of each knot described, such as a deuce of clubs to designate 'unimportance', or an kedge anchor to indicate 'reliability'.<br />Equally important as the knot's description was their utilization on incidental equipment.  Mr. Ashley fortuitously included a description of a rope's application on fairleads, belaying pins, H-bitts, cleats, thumb-cleats, fife rails, pin rails, pin racks, and timberheads; as well as escoteric equipment such as euphroe blocks and crows foots. <br />The book also includes the important distinction between the kevel (or cavil) and the quarter cleat.  The glossary in the back makes another refinement by distinguishing the knot from the sinnet, splice, hitch, and bend.  Thus clearing up any misassumptions in knot application (such as that Knot Theory is a branch of pure mathematics and has nothing to do with Knot Tying!) - THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS settles any disputes in nomenclature.<br />The only short-coming to this significant work is that the drawings are unclear and vague in some instances, making it impossible to tye a knot in the example given.  The book is dated in respect to splicing modern power braids such as Liquid Crystal Polymer, Spectra, or Kevlar; and makes no mention of the type of knot or splice found in an Astronaut's tether.<br />Still this can be tolerated in view of the wealth of information and history on knots, splices, and rope contained within its pages.  And THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS has gained a further importance in its power of verification.  For when some nimrod claims to have invented a new knot or splice, immediately the universal response is: &quot;Just look it up in Ashley's!&quot;
B000002A3T|4.0|With the sad, untimely passing of keyboardist Richard Wright from cancer in September 2008, 1994's \\"The Division Bell\\" is now, officially, the final studio album by Pink Floyd. Even though Roger Waters' presence on the album is missed, \\"The Division Bell,\\" while not scaling the heights of classic Pink Floyd albums like \\"Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" \\"Animals,\\" or \\"The Wall,\\" is a fine Floyd album in it's own right. It's a good improvement over 1987's \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,\\" which suffered somewhat from a late-80's polished production, too many session players, and very few contributions from Wright & drummer Nick Mason. With \\"The Division Bell,\\" both Wright & Mason are prominently back behind their instruments where they belong, and the album certainly *sounds* much more like a Pink Floyd recording than it's predecessor. The rockers \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" & \\"Keep Talking\\" smack of classic Floyd, and the instrumentals \\"Cluster One\\" and the Grammy-winning \\"Marooned\\" are simply dreamy. The band also loosen up quite refreshingly on radio-friendly tunes like \\"Take It Back\\" and \\"Coming Back To Life,\\" two songs that might have left some Floyd purists aghast, but I enjoy them. \\"Lost For Words\\" is an obvious look at the then-ongoing Gilmour vs Waters feud (although the two men aren't feuding so much anymore), while \\"Wearing The Inside Out\\" marks the wonderful return of Richard Wright to the microphone, his first lead vocal on a Floyd album since \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" Finally, \\"High Hopes\\" ends the album on a very haunting, Floydian note. Although still using the services of session players, Gilmour, Mason & Wright are all up front in the mix, playing together with great style. Gilmour's lead-guitar work still rocks, Wright's keyboard-playing is terrific, and Mason, though drumming a bit slower this time out, still keeps the beat strong & steady. And Gilmour's voice still sounds quite good as well, whether he's singing smoothly on the softer numbers, or belting out the rockers. Unfortunately for the world's Floyd fans, Gilmour basically lost interest in the band after the tour for \\"The Division Bell,\\" deciding to spend more time at home as a family man than recording & touring as a Floyd man. Pink Floyd never toured again, and Wright's passing in 2008 officially puts the Floyd to rest for good. I wish they had done at least one or two more albums before the end, but \\"The Division Bell\\" is still a very strong album for this legendary band to exit with. So, with deep respect, I say so long, Pink Floyd. Thanks guys---including Roger and Syd Barrett---for all of your magnificent music. And shine on, Richard. Say hi to Syd for us.
B00000IQMT|4.0|This is an interesting mix of music from John Williams.<BR>He has brought back some of that old Star Wars magic but sadly left most of it behind. The weakest Star Wars soundtrack made yet. There are about 3 interesting tracks the rest sounds like rehashed music from E.T., Hook and other JW classics.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This album is incredible! Hilarious and completely fantastic musicianship. The production is awsome...Can't wait for the next one! Buy it now, or you will seriously regret it!
B00005RFAI|5.0|A key moment on Pink's new CD occurs midway through the second track. \\"I'm tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears,\\" sings the fuchsia-haired 22-year-old in a voice that blends weariness and defiance in a way that belies Pink's youth. The line is less a slam against Spears than a declaration of a desire to loosen the shackles of dance pop diva-dom. With Missundaztood, Pink takes a giant step in that direction. <BR>To be sure, Pink continues to work her groove thang on much of Missundaztood, but equal time is given over to some genuine stylistic risk-taking. \\"Just Like a Pill,\\" for instance, boasts a driving pop-rock beat shot through with an '80s retro vibe. Likewise, the Fiona Apple-ish \\"Numb\\" comes charged with sex-and-danger melodrama, and finds Pink oscillating between a whisper and a scream. <br />Elsewhere, Pink shows she's no slouch at bringing raw emotion to a ballad, provided the song is worthy of the effort. The soul-searching \\"Lonely Girl,\\" for example, brims with the subtle urgency of a real quest. Similarly, on the gospel-y \\"Misery\\" (a duet with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler) Pink comes off as a gifted torch singer wise beyond her years. <br />Indeed, when listening to Missundaztood one can't help noticing that Pink, as a vocalist, rises or falls in accordance with the strength of her material. In that regard, much credit is due former 4 Non Blonde member Linda Perry, who wrote, co-wrote, and produced much of Missundaztood. On her debut, Pink proved she could sing. This time around, she shows she knows how to inhabit a song.
B000066AXC|5.0|This story caught my attention immediately and held it for the entire film. The movie is based on the life of John Nash.  He was a brilliant mathematician who became famous as a young man for his work in economics.<br />The film spans several decades and begins when John Nash arrives at Princeton University.  Russell Crowe does an excellent job in the role of Nash.  The part required the transformation of Nash from a young and healthy man to an aging schizophrenic. Alicia, Nash's wife is played by Jennifer Connelly. She's very convincing as an intelligent and strong woman who comes to realize that her brilliant husband is very troubled and lives in another world.<br />One particular and lovely scene stands out in my mind where Nash and his future wife are looking at the stars. He tells her to think of different shapes or animals and he is able to look at the night sky, with its millions of stars, and link them together into whatever form she mentions. I wish there had been more scenes of that kind and maybe a little insight into Nash's family and childhood.<br />John Nash was eventually awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for Mathematics, which is some consolation, but the tragedy of his gifted mind being assaulted by delusions was something that I won't forget. I came away from this movie with a tremendous amount of compassion for John Nash.  Schizophrenia is truly a horrible mental disease.<br />This film is worth seeing and I believe that it will stand the test of time.
0802130208|4.0|Reading a highly popular, arguably classic, cult favorite with a fresh eye and without preconceptions is not an easy task.  I expected Ignatius J. Reilly to leap off the page at me.  I wasn't disappointed.   On the first page, outside a staid department store in New Orleans, Ignatius in his usual grotesque costume of green hunting camp and too small flannel shirt is awaiting his mother innocently enough until a policeman decides he is a vagrant and tries to arrest him.  A crowd is quickly engaged by his steaming objections and loud protestations.  Ignatius is at his best when hollering for help.  When his weary mother makes an appearance, \\"Mother!\\" he called \\"Not a moment too soon.  I've been seized.\\"<br />We quickly meet friends and denizens not quite on the underside of New Orleans, but leaning that way.  Ignatius is a force of nature that needs to be fed, nurtured, and kept on course not only by his long-suffering mother, but any citizen who happens to cross his path.  If Ignatius is left to his own devices, he is like a loose pinball, except a pinball never screams for help.<br />Ignatius, who is the epitome of pseudo independence and ingratitude, actually is fearful of being left alone.  When his mother, for the first time in living memory, decides to have a night out, Ignatius is piteous, \\"I shall probably be misused by some intruder!\\" he screamed.<br />For the first third of the book, I was highly indignant at Ignatius: his selfishness, his arrogance and his ingratitude.  Gradually, I became fond of him and then fearful for him.  He is underscored with tragedy; he has a vision of a world not of his making and it threatens him.  Somehow Mr. Toole gathers up all the threads and the end is not chaos as I feared, but everyone seems to get just what they deserve.  I was pleased, and I think you will be too.<BR>-sweetmolly-Amazon Reviewer
B00005R2M3|5.0|Already a star in her native Colombia, 24 year-old singer and soap actress Shakira's first album to include English language songs, Laundry Service, is a curious amalgam of popular music that frequently melds contrary styles. At various points, Shakira's songs brazenly add Nashville pop to Eurodisco, classic rock to world music, alternative rock to disco, with many more permutations not too far below the surface. <BR>Laundry Service, Shakira's fifth CD (she recorded her debut at fourteen) should be a mess. Instead, it's a strong and appealingly quirky (though sometimes obvious) effort, a vivacious distillation of western rock and pop into the singer's own mixed Latin and Lebanese roots. <br />A gaudy tango sets the pace for dance pop opener, &quot;Objection;&quot; a roaring, bluesy rock riff introduces the Spanish language track &quot;Te Dejo Madrid;&quot; and a Middle Eastern affection tempers &quot;Eyes Like Yours.&quot; When she sings in English -- which she does on nine of the twelve songs here -- Shakira sounds coy and sweet, as if tutored by Gwen Stefani, with a cracked yelp borrowed from the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan, characteristics which are less noticeable on the Spanish-language tracks. Whatever the language, the passion seems all hers, and genuinely felt. This is DayGlo, mall pop/rock at its absolute finest.
B0000640VO|4.0|Once in a long while a movie filled with quirkiness, eccentricity, and dark humor will creep into my \\"must see\\" rentals list...Amelie was definitely one of them.Even the front dvd cover packaging grabs your attention (it's very reminiscent of either a Pixar Bug's Life dvd cover or a Walt Disney film release cover of the 60's).After hearing the Oscar buzz about this off beat French comedy I needed to find out for myself what the big deal was. Well, for starters it has a pretty French actress named Audrey Tautou who has definitely captured my attention (beautiful dark eyes and plenty of skillful talent on screen)! The acting chemistry between Audrey Tatou and director/actor Mathieu Kassovitz was perfect and authentic (they really looked like a good couple);Very believable...<br />The story centers around a meek and introverted waitress who cherishes her solitude...That is until she discovers that she has quite an uncanny knack for bringing great cheer and happiness to others concerning matters of the  heart. However, the real comedy comes into play when Amelie retaliates against those who take great sadisitic pleasure in harrassing the under dogs ! While she accomplishes these great feats through well calculated yet very eccentric methods she is unable to bring herself to find her own personal happiness with the opposite sex.She is able to play Dear Abby in a very enigmatic way to those who do not suspect she is helping them, yet is unable to follow her own advice !...<br />Amelie is rich with colorful characters and witty (French) dialogue. Non-human characters from Amelie's vivid imagination come to life with remarkable computer animated graphics. The French location and scenery is truly amazing ! One can even feel the wind blowing on several scenes where Amelie's father's home is located (just check out the garden scene where he is accepting mail from the postman and you'll know what I mean)! Amelie is beautifully crafted and filmed in richly saturated colors for the dvd format. The 5.1 surround digital mix isn't too shabby, either. Just listen to the deep bass sound effect emitted when Amelie's mother encounters an ...well, I can't tell you, just see the dvd (this particular scene makes good use of the .1 digital bass as well as the term \\"dark humor\\")!...<br />If there is one foreign \\"must see\\" film on your list this year, make it Amelie.
B0000027I6|5.0|Of the thousands of albums that I have owned, not to mentioned the others that I borrowed, this is the second best (the best is Pink Floyd &quot;The Wall&quot;, of course). The lyrics are smooth and thought provoking. The music is crisp and stirring. The recording is among the finest (I use this album as one of a dozen when testing high-end audiophile systems). This is Roger Waters at his best -- better than his solo albums, not as dark as PF's &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, not as good as PF's &quot;The Wall&quot; (which is because the rest of the band work together). If you want emotion stirring dynamics, put this on and give it a spin.
B00006F7S4|5.0|Beck fans usually have a hard time agreeing on what Beck's best album is.  I personally think it's \\"Odelay\\", as do a lot of poeple out there.  \\"Mutations\\" and \\"Midnight Vultures\\" were good, but I believe they had the misfortune of coming after \\"Odelay\\", and I was never crazy about them.  I think the reason people disagree is because Beck is probably the most versatile musician putting out new material today.  While all of Becks albums have similarities, they are all unique in some way.  Beck doesn't rely on any one style or genre, and can usually blend them seamlessly.  Beck could probably put out a Polka album and make it work. <br />Sea Change is Beck's best album since \\"Odelay\\".  Listeners familiar with Becks folky, more accoustical works will find it similar to some of his other work, but the Bluesy, dark lyrics are something we're not used to seeing from Beck.  I've heard all the stories of how Beck was inspired and I won't bore you with them.  Anyone who's ever gone through a bad break-up or divorse knows the deal.  I think when an artist attempts to apply it to his work he can either come off as pretentious and whiney, if they have the talent, can introduce a new level of depth and emotion.  I think Beck pulled this one off well.<br />Not only is it one of Beck's best albums, it may be one of the best albums of the year.  It's not an original concept by any stretch of imagination, but Becks' powers as a songwriter and his talent as a musician elevate it well above most of the pap on the market today.  <br />There's a chance you won't like this album depending on how rigid your view of Beck is.  If you still think of him as the {guy} from the early nineties you are in for a surprise.  If your curious, you should go to his site and listen to some of the songs.  Fair warning: listening to the compressed versions of the songs really doesn't do them complete justice.  A lot of the subtleties and background music is lost.  If you like what you hear, you will love the album, but if your not sure, don't give up on the basis of those compressed tracks.  The final product is an incredible, subtle performance and one of his best.
B00002Z83J|5.0|Calling Card is my first Rory Gallagher album I ever bought. It won't be my last(in fact I now plan to get them all).<BR>This man needs much more recognition for the wonderful contribution he made to the blues. Calling Card is such a maginificent album because it showcases Gallagher's blues history, and shows where he was headed with his jazz influences.I love all the tracks, but in particular I love the swing of 'Calling Card', the new directions taken with 'Moonchild', and the soul-driven 'Edged in Blue. I could go on and on about the other tracks, but you HAVE to hear this man for yourself.<BR>Make no mistake though, Gallagher is the stuff blues is made of through and through, and I can only hope that more people become exposed to this wonderful artist.
B000001EHS|5.0|TERRIFIC album, took me straight back to my teen years (oops, just revealed my age there ... )<br />If you like DL at all, you simply must have this disc.  Be sure, though, to also buy 'SLANG' and 'X' so that your collection will be somewhat well-rounded!<br />Leps 4 ever -
630289915X|5.0|This movie is a true classic and no true movie fan should be without a copy in their collection at any time.  Frank Capra greatest film and Jimmy Stewart is perfect as George Bailey.  If you like this film, I also recommend the Capra/Stewart teaming in \\"Mr Smith goes to Washington\\" another little man beats the impossible odds film.  Happy viewing
B000059TPI|5.0|&quot;Harvey&quot; is one of THE best classics made. Great and superb<BR>comic acting from Josephine Hull. She is wonderful. No wonder she got the Academy Award. Jimmy Stewart is marvelous. What would have been great was at the end, when Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd walks away from the sanitarium gats and down the road on the hill, they could have shown like a ghostly image of a rabbit to show the audience that the rabbit was there all the time. I was waiting for that to happen when I first saw it, but never did and I thought &quot;Gee, that's disappointing.&quot; That didn't stop me from watching it countless times. I love it, and it's a great<BR>way to relax from a hard day.
B000002KEV|5.0|This is THE album that legends are made of.  In an era where most live albums don't make the grade, it makes one appreciate the power of Deep Purple live onstage.<br />The band's passion and momentum is in full gear here. It doesn't get better than this.  Ian Gillan's scream is amazing and the band is TIGHT.  There's a musical bond between the members which seems unbreakable.<br />Even more surprising was how Ian Gillan was about to leave the band, and according to the liner notes, was unhappy with his performance (!). None of that is evident in this performance, and what a show it is.<br />While other live albums by bands like Led Zeppelin were released too late...MADE IN JAPAN simply captures a band at the right moment. It's an immortal moment that hasn't diminished with time.The band is at its absolute peak, and one wonders what might have been.<br />The bonus here is a 2nd CD of Black Night, Speed King and Lucille.  Don't buy this CD without them in the package.<br />If you have to buy one live rock album or one live Deep Purple album - this is the ONE.  Forget the rest.
0380789019|5.0|Very good book, tremendous storytelling ability - the juxtaposition of the dark, resigned, gloom of everyday world against the shining, humble heroism is just terrific.  Don't make any plans to do anything else for a few hours, though! :)
B00006JJ2Y|4.0|This album is an excellent snapshot of Lou's post-Street Hassle live show.  Lou and the band don't even pretend to try to pull off \\"perfect\\" versions of these songs - instead they attack them and by doing so showed 1978 audiences that you didn't have to play like the Sex Pistols or the Ramones to have an attitude.  My biggest complaint about this album is that the edited-down versions of songs like \\"Waiting for the Man\\" and \\"Walk on the Wild Side\\" have STILL not been restored to full-length for CD release.  This has to be the fourth or fifth time this album has been put out without addressing this issue.  If the Who can extend the \\"Live at Leeds\\" album, why can't TNP at least be issued with full takes?
6305499365|4.0|This is almost a live-action Dilbert movie.  This film takes a look at modern corporate culture and lampoons it.  If you have ever worked in a cubicle, this movie will strike a chord within you.  Whether you are seeing the consultants, or efficiency experts, interview people before the lay-off; listening to the sing-song voice of the customer service representative, or watching the employees get mad at the fax machine; this will all seem eerily familiar.<br />Quite a few of the scenes nod to other movies of popular culture, as well as sate our thirst for revenge against work.  This mixture makes from some memorable images.  The camera work used as the conspirators initiate their plan or \\"celebrate\\" their lay-off is hilarious.<br />My problem with the film is that it feels great as a series of short films, but as a whole movie, it doesn't hold up as well.  Although Mike Judge (who wrote, directed, and acted here) forecasts what would happen in the end, it still feels like \\"deus ex machina.\\"  It feels like he couldn't think of how to end it, so he just threw this in.  It does take some suspension of disbelief.  The argument between Peter and his girlfriend also seems a little contrived.<br />All in all, this is a funny movie.  I would recommend seeing it.
B000001ESP|5.0|Rush's music reached a peak in 1981 with this brilliant album. The compositions, though less complex and more accesible on previous records, are perfect, the lyrics are amazing, and the playing totally resembles Rush's chemistry. <BR><BR>Any fan who wants to get into Rush, or rock music for that matter, should start with this album. It's cerebral, dark, catchy and absolutely brilliant. Not one note or song is out of place, and the album flows in your speakers. It's an album I never get tired of, though I listened to it all the time for the past 7 years, and this album should be more widely acknowledged. Permanent Waves and Hemispheres beat this, personally, in terms of my tastes, but this really is THE album to define Rush.
B000001IPL|5.0|this cd is the best offspring cd ever. every song is good or great. each one is strong in its own way. great cd!
B000001ESN|5.0|This album clocks in at 35 minutes and 42 seconds, but one second more would be too much, and excessive. It's my favorite Rush album, and it's completely satisfying in every way imaginable. <BR><BR>\\"The Spirit of Radio\\" is one of the most popular songs of their entire catalogue, and it's very light and catchy. Certainly the 'worst' song on the album, but most artists would kill to have a song like this be one of their worst. <BR><BR>\\"Freewill\\" rocks! The mood changes and the complex rhythms and guitar riffs are incredibly moving, and contains my favorite quote ever: \\"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\\" <BR><BR>\\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is ominous, and eerie. The instrumental interlude is one of the darkest and one of the best rock moments ever. <BR><BR>\\"Entre Nous\\" is Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead,\\" meets any sappy love song of that era. The song is about togetherness and relationships but in very thought-provoking and very sagacious terms (\\"we are islands to each other...). <BR><BR>\\"Different Strings\\" is a 'ballad' but not like Styx or anything. It's very introspective, and the lyrics of this song are actually Geddy Lee's. He has a tendency to be more peronal, than the philisophical, sci-fi influenced uber-drummer/lyricist Neil Peart. <BR><BR>\\"Natural Science\\" is the best Rush 'epic' (at 9 minutes long) they ever did, and perhaps their best song. It's totally euphoric, and to me that's what heaven sounds like. <BR><BR>The best Rush album, on a personal level, and it's also definitive, but somehow, Moving Pictures receives more credit. Either way, pick both of them up for some of the greatest music you'll probably ever hear.

B00006JIAF|5.0|I bought this Cd from reading an article about the Strokes in a magazine. I had no knowledge of Last nite or any other song but as soon as I put the Cd in I instantly fell in love. If you like white stripes, sloan, sleater-kinney or the pixies this band is for you!!<BR>I would NOT recommend this Cd to people who like the song last nite because nothing else sounds like it on the cd. I recommend buying this double because New York City Cops is the best song by the Strokes and it was only available bootlegged in north america until now.<BR>One of the bands who may save the music industry is THE STROkes
B000062X9B|4.0|There is no voice like Johnny Cash's.. he knows the importance of intonation. Not only does he know what to say, he knows HOW to say things. Really, just with an acoustic guitar and his own voice, he'd make reading the classifieds sound like a poignant journey. <BR>This album is worth buying for his cover of U2's One alone. It's one of the only instances when an artist has improved on something that is already a classic. His interpretation of this song... makes me cry every time I hear it. The original has never had much of an impact on me whatsoever. His interpretations are emotionally affecting, yet superficially seem so simple. It's a mystery to me what it is about his voice that makes me listen so, but I'm still listening.
B00006AFUR|5.0|My rule of thumb is that if I hear two good songs from an album I'll buy it.  I heard &quot;Capricorn&quot; and &quot;The Mission,&quot; thought they were both very good, so I picked up a copy of Thirty Seconds to Mars' self-titled debut.  Well, I am certainly glad I did, because there are many more good songs on this disc.  This album, while by no means perfect, is one of the best debut efforts published by a major label in quite some time.  I feel that no more than one or two albums a year merit the top 5-star rating.  In fact, I haven't heard a single 2002 release that I would consider 5-star.  Until now.  And what's scary about that is that there IS room for improvement.  I should probably call it 4 1/2, but there is an intangible quality to it that draws you in.<br />Personally I don't like to compare bands to one another, since most (good) bands develop their own sound, as 30STM does here.  However, to guide those thinking of purchasing the album, I will...  The sound is influenced by classic progressive bands such as Rush and Pink Floyd (Bob Ezrin of &quot;The Wall&quot; fame produced the album).  It produces wide, atmospheric sounds and nuances that fill the room.  At the same time, it has the powerful guitars and vocals of bands such as Tool (probably the best and most unique act currently out there).  Songs like &quot;Echelon&quot; have an eighties, Depeche Mode feel.  While drawing on these influences, they manage to build an ALBUM (not just a song or two) of music that is unlike anything else out there.  Yes, you can hear the influences, but the finished sound is their own.<br />Lyrically, the album is only average.  It certainly is MUCH better than the drivel you hear on the radio these days, but on the other hand it does not offer the extraordinary thematic ideas of the aforementioned influential bands.  They could be better, are a bit strained, and don't do justice to the overall themes. On the good side though, the lyrics, like the sound, are uniquein this day and age.  Thankfully there is no woe-is-me self-pity.  The lyrics are clearly personal, but they try to convey larger ideas of renewal, change and the future.  None of the ideas are concrete ones, and as such they leave a great deal to the listener's own imagination (I think intentionally).  These open-to-interpretation lyrics combined with the ambient soundscapes mean each listener will get something different from the album.<br />But in my mind, the music, not the lyrics, are what 30STM are about.  The album is loaded with special effects and synthesizers, but they are not overdone, and are maintained at a level appropriate to the album's themes.  But these effects do not dominate the sound; they merely augment it.  The guitars and melodies pull you in and enchant.  Each piece of the sound could be pulled out, analyzed, and improved upon.  But in the end it achieves its desired EFFECT.  The sonic atmosphere is done beautifully and intelligently, and here the whole is better than the sum of its parts.<br />Many of the latter songs just drop off, as if they could not figure out how to end the song.  They would have been better off weaving the songs together instead of forcing blank space between each track.  Apart from that production point, the album just SOUNDS good.  It is melodious, strange, interesting, distinctive, intelligent, artistic and an all around enjoyable audio experience.  Overall, 30STM is a compelling debut effort, and the best album of 2002.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I purchased this for my son (who was 18m at the time) thinking that it would be a good first introduction to shapes and colors.  It really was!  He took to it right away and (for all you tired mothers and fathers out there) he stuck with it for a good half hour!  It has pegs for each of the shapes and at first, he was having a little difficulty putting the appropriate shape on the right group of pegs, but he soon figured it out.  The holes in the shapes are large enough so it is not difficult at all to put the shapes on the pegs - sometimes the problem with traditional puzzles.  It is durable - made of really nice wood - made to last!  I love wooden toys - just for the sake of durability and longevity - and this one is really worth it because you really get your money's worth.  Just be careful - as with all puzzle pieces...they are easy to lose around the house.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I recently saw Sprited Away at the Mayan theatre in Denver, CO and I found it to be an awesome movie, it totally immerses you in the experience and I left the theatre with a \\"wow\\" (along with a friend of mine, who thought the same) I highly recommend this movie, and even if it does have english dubbing it is done superbly, I highly recommend this movie/dvd
068981528X|5.0|What a wonderful book this is, turning the traditional story upside down.  Other authors have done this, but Eugene Trivizas is particularly clever and Helen Oxenburys drawings capture the personalities very well.  The role reversal is easy enough, but Trivizas adds layers of humor with his descriptions of the wolves and the pig. The three cuddly little wolves with soft and furry tales enjoy such genteel pursuits as croquet, battledore, and shuttlecock, and the big bad pig uses a sledgehammer, a pneumatic drill, and dynamite to destroy the very study houses.  Theres a wonderful paradoxical ending (the house made of flowers is the strongest), just one of the many creative twists and turns to the traditional story. Despite the pigs potent methods of destruction, no animals are hurt (except for some slightly scorched tales) in the book.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have to say that this album captures a hard-to-find quality of emotion and sentiment that cuts right to the heart of a moment in life.<br />Don't believe any naysayers (if they even exist) - this is Beck, truthful and heartfelt.
B00001OH7P|3.0|Now I ask you, how can you rise and fall when the world's about to be blown up? And where does it actually say Ziggy is an alien? I challenge anyone out there to give me PROOF that Ziggy Stardust is an alien. A starman is mentioned, but he doesn't appear to want to land. Ziggy could be a car boot salesman from Dulwich for all we know. I mean, aliens don't say \\"wam bam thank you, ma'am\\", they say \\"take me to your leader\\". At least, the one in my bedroom did the other night. He always seems to show up when I forget my meds. He's Gnome like, and laughs a lot. So we talked for a bit and I came to the conclusion that aliens are likely to be scientists who want to take soil samples or give ultimatums to the UN, not strap on guitars and become rock stars. And they wouldn't get past the medical if they were confused about their sexuality. So where's the evidence, eh? Eh? who started this rumour that Ziggy Stardust was from out of space? Besides, if he was actually the alien, would he say \\"put your raygun to my head, press your spaceface close to mine\\"? No, because he would be holding the raygun himself. And on the eponymous track it says the kids killed the MAN, not the alien! I rest my case. So really, I reckon it's about some guy from East London who is so dumb he starts a rock band in the last five years of planet Earth's existence. I mean, how are you going to collect royalties? Doesn't matter, really, the music's rather fun. 'Soul Love' has rather an interesting lyric which I'd never paid much attention to. Aliens are distracting when you're on the headphones. Medication time.
B000001EG6|5.0|Because EMPTY SKY didn't see an American release, Elton John's self-titled second album was what first caused people to take notice of England's newest music sensation. This was probably not a bad idea because after the ambitious-as-hell EMPTY SKY, the follow-up gave us the bare essence of what Elton & lyricist Bernie Taupin were all about: insanely-catchy melodies & intelligent lyrics pop music hadn't seen the like of since the arrival of Bob Dylan (a huge influence on the duo, for sure). So if ELTON JOHN (1970) must be the beginning of Elton's legacy (although an inaccurate one), so be it.<br /><br />Of course, this is the destination for \\"Your Song\\", which is probably still the #1 favorite song for Elton fans around the world (even non-fans, like my mom). Elton & Bernie's love songs were still rather direct around this time, so \\"Your Song\\" was a perfect choice for a first major hit single as any. Even as the duo's explorations into love songs became more complex (the coming-of-age \\"First Episode At Hienton\\" already shows the transformation starting), \\"Your Song\\" still dazzles with its heartfelt simplicity (not to mention its guaranteed appearance in any concert playlist).<br /><br />While EMPTY SKY tried to jam too many genres onto one album (or often on one song), ELTON JOHN kind of continues that ethic, but it coalesces more this time around. The harpsichord that beautifully adorned \\"Skyline Pigeon\\" makes another appearance on \\"I Need You To Turn To\\", while \\"Sixty Years On\\" (both songs looking at the ravages of age from men who were still in their early 20s!), \\"The Greatest Discovery\\" (about the birth of Bernie's younger brother) & \\"The King Must Die\\" show the emerging influence of conductor Paul Buckmaster. The lyrics show Bernie making that leap into songwriting master, unlike on EMPTY SKY where he seemed too eager to impress. But \\"Border Song\\" is another song that amazes with its simple-but-valid call for peace & tolerance & was therefore a natural cover for Aretha Franklin, who took Elton into the American top 40 for the first time.<br /><br />Those who know Elton as a slick purveyor of Adult Contemporary pop nowadays might be surprised to know he did a fair share of rocking early in his career & ELTON JOHN shows him not afraid to tear it up. \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\" is another surefire concert rouser (even with its indecipherable lyrics); \\"No Shoe Strings On Louise\\" is Elton's hats-off to the Stones with a country-rocker that might have been at home on STICKY FINGERS (which would come out the next year); \\"The Cage\\" is almost funky with its Santana-inspired congas & lyrics about wanting to break free from the conformity the outside world imposes upon us.<br /><br />The inclusion of bonus tracks is indeed a pleasure this time around, but like those of EMPTY SKY, they're hit & miss at best. \\"Bad Side Of The Moon\\" is another one of those \\"what-the-heck-is-it-about\\" tunes that Bernie found coming from his pen back in the early days (but could Pink Floyd have found their inspiration for DARK SIDE OF THE MOON here?). \\"Grey Seal\\" would later be remade for GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD (1973) & it's a song that's still very much in demo form at this stage. Interesting only to hear how much better it would soon get. \\"Rock & Roll Madonna\\" on the other hand is a song that definitely should have made the album! Again, it's a tune that will quiet all carps that Elton couldn't really rock & he contributes some of his best piano playing ever (saying a whole lot), proving his debt to Jerry Lee Lewis & other piano pounders. The lyrics seem to be about a fast-living groupie, which in retrospect are a bit more ironic than they may have sounded at the time.<br /><br />ELTON JOHN sure enough introduced America to the young man from Middlesex, England who would change the face of pop music. It was so successful, that Elton would soon be called on to produce two albums a year & also tour behind them (if that's not a busy schedule, tell me what is). Both albums of that year would go platinum virtually on release & help make Elton probably the most successful musician of the 1970s (exactly who that is is open to debate). It would be wrong to overlook EMPTY SKY, but still, ELTON JOHN was where his legend really began.).

B00005OAIE|5.0|I'm usually a strick R & B gal, the pop stuff makes me want to throw up but this CD is slammin.  Soulful voice, interesting lyrics and a nice groove.  \\"83\\" makes me smile and the other tracks keep it flowing...  I had to pick up 2 cause I got tired of taking it out the of the car.  Now I keep one in the ride and one at home
B000002AHM|5.0|If there is a better all-guitar album out there, I can assure you that after 15 years of hard-core collecting and delving into every genre imaginable I dont know what what it is.  As a live concert piece, the CD remaster sounds gorgeous.  As a showcase for technical mastery of the instrument, it is without peer - it will be assured to amaze even the most jaded Shrapnel and Dream Theater worshipping-dweebs (reviewer included, thank you very much :-).  As a demonstration of all the warmth and humanity contained in the individual personalities of the players, it can't be beat.  &quot;Mediterranean Sundance/Rio Ancho&quot; is a riveting opener - A rapid-fire tradeoff between DiMeola and DeLucia, it showcases the utterly fluid, light-speed phrasing of Al's steel-string and the alien beauty of DeLucia's traditional flamenco technique.  Al seems utterly incapable of hitting a bad note, and about a minute into this thing lays down an absolutely jaw-dropping solo that is probably capable of genuflecting most mortals instantly.  It seems like he has twenty fingers on each hands as he flies effortlessly over the fretboard, soloing with passion and elegance unmatched by any perormance on any of his solo albums.  DeLucia is like a hummingbird flitting over the power-shred of DiMeola, and though he hits a few sour notes, hetrades off some electrifying solos with Al.  &quot;Short Tales of the Black Forest&quot;, featuring DiMeola and McLaughlin, is quite possibly the strongest musical statement any one of these musicians could make about how to fuse the profoundly technical with the confoundedly heartfelt.  This piece is a simply magical re-interpretation of the original Chick Corea tune, laced with mezmerising dynamics, powerful emotional climaxes and genuinely funny spur-of-the-moment antics.  I've never heard two masters have so much spontaneous fun, and is the kind of thing that could never be replicated in the studio.  &quot;Frevo Rascado&quot; is a fine DeLucia duet with McLaughlin, although it is not nearly as fiery as the initial duet with DiMeola.  McLaughlin's playing is not flashy as much as it is sympathetic and allows DeLucia to really breathe and demonstrate some of the more intricate flamenco rhythm techniques here, altough their unison playing and solo tradeoffs towards the end of the piece are magnificent in their precision.  Its hard to beat the concert finale, a magnificent re-arrangement of DiMeola's &quot;Fantasia Suite&quot;, a song which appeared on _Casino_ but simply takes flight here.  Here all three guitarists parade and add flourish to DiMeola's heroic riffs to a climax where all three players trade off stop-start solos that progress left-to-right and then unify into a double-time coda of the initial riff!  If pants aren't soiled by now I dont know what else to tell you.  &quot;Guardian Angel&quot; is a reworking of a song McLaughlin did with the One Truth Band and feels somewhat out of place here, though its (slightly) more controlled tone may be appreciated by the uninitated, who will no doubt need to &quot;cool off&quot; after getting lit up by the live tracks on this gorgeous disc.  A bonafide classic and one of the most consistently exciting pieces of music I have ever heard.
B00004BZ16|5.0|P>Now, onto the album itself:<br />I can't claim to know whether or not it represents musical genius or is subtle and nuanced or any other such thing, but I can tell you this: I like it.  A lot. As much as London Calling. <br />The tracks are extremely diverse (of course), but the point is, they WORK. Some are mad dancy fun, like Look Here, Let's Go Crazy, Police on my Back, and The Sound of Sinners. Some are deep and soulful, including Corner Soul (\\"Is the music calilng for a river of blood?\\"), Charlie Dont Search and Something about England, while others, such as Rebel Waltz and Washington Bullets, are (in different ways) light and melodic.  Meanwhile The Magnificent Seven and The Call Up evoke the anger present on the (British version of) the self-titled.<br />I think my favorite thing about Sandinista! is the stories told by many of the songs and the images they invoke.  Something About England makes a social statement but also feels like an urban fantasy a la Neil Gaiman or Charles de Lint, while Rebel Waltz has the feel of a traditional fantasy or historical novel; you actually begin to care about the fate of the rebel army and see them \\"dancing to the news that the war is not won.\\"  Let's Go Crazy, meanwhile...well, this one you really have to hear to understand.<br />What it comes down to is this: This album can make for a wonderful listening experience, but it isn't for everyone. If you're into the Clash cause you're a HardKore Punk Rawk type (insert additional x's and k's as needed), then this probably isn't for you (or maybe it is, and it'll help you snap out of it). Otherwise, give it a try, and don't give up after the first listen; let it grow on you. If nothing else it's not that expensive, and it'll complete your Clash collection.
B00005JKGK|1.0|Imagine how you would feel if someone released a film with some other racist caricatures - a blackface dancer, perhaps, and it so happens that the director happens to be black! Does that make the caricature more acceptable? More authentic?  I think not.<br />In my opinion, Tan had produced something very, very ugly.<br />Amy Tan had become famous for her book that this film was based on. The film popularized the story to the movie-watching community. She is now considered to be a leading figure in the Asian American literature. But my impression so far was of Tan's tortured and distorted view of her original culture - it makes me sad to think that for many people, Tan's misguided work was their first exposure to Asian culture.<br />It is difficult to imagine that the author could have been unaware of the Hollywood stereotypes of Asian culture. I've recently read an interview where Tan states that her fiction should not be regarded as an instrument that breaks these stereotypes.  But if that is the case, why would she, who is an Asian herself, work to perpetuate the misconception of her own culture?<br />So, I was particularly disturbed when I watched this film.  I was angered not because it did not promote some positive image about Asians - to be fair, I don't think this was intended to be considered a political statement.  And my basic assumption about watching a film is only to be entertained.  However, Tan's work simply insults the viewer's intelligence by capitalizing on her ethnicity to place authenticity to the stereotype that she kowtows to in the film.  And that itself makes this movie worthless to watch, in my opinion.<br />I just wanted you to be aware of this before you purchase this DVD.
0060392886|5.0|This book is amazing.  The boys of Motley Crue have to be some of the most messed up people around.  This book was so entertaining that I was reading it aloud to a group of 8 and they wouldn't let me stop reading.  They must make it into a movie.  <br />Look out for the part of Tommy Lee's \\"typical day\\" on the Girls, Girls Girls tour.  Amazing.....but also very pathetic!

One man tries to unravel the mystery of Earth's new masters.  But it is the equivilent of trying to get a dog to understand nuclear physics.<br />Clarke's explanation of many of the old legends was probably the first to do so.

B00005RFAI|4.0|I have Pink's first album and I love it.  I bought this one and I love it also.  I have no problem with her changing herself. I absolutley adore \\"Don't let me get me\\". It's my favorite song in the whole collection.  \\"Just like a pill\\" is something I can relate to also.  I have to say that I am amazed at the venom and meaness people display when they are reveiwing stuff they don't like.  This album included. Lighten up.  It's only music!!!!
B00005QIPH|3.0|Big Tobacco has been shameless in its disregard for human-life, but its disregard extends to animal life, too. The tobacco industry uses animals to test the effectiveness of new products. Cats, frogs, rats, guinea pigs, and dogs are just some of the animals that have been used for experimentation by Big Tobacco. Animals have even been used to prove that tobacco is harmful. Dogs first proved that cigarette smoke was a carcinogen when some Beagles were given tracheostomies and then exposed to cigarette smoke through machines.<br />In the case of R.J. Reynolds (RJR), corporate interest in animals goes well beyond its Camel cigarettes. In 1989, RJR was working on a \\"safer\\" cigarette called Premier, but Premier was not going over well with humans because it required a big drag in order to draw the smoke out. So, RJR decided to see how baboons used Premier in order to make Premier cigarettes a better \\"drug delivery device\\" for humans. The study was designed to demonstrate to RJR whether strong addictions helped the subject overcome difficulties with drawing smoke from Premier.<br />So, to summarize, I think the problem the Strokes have is their overexposure. They run into a paradox because, while the music itself isn't all that bad, they get a lot of credit for being something that they are not: music-gods. Hence, this album is both underrated and overrated.
6305181810|5.0|It is indeed refresing to see \\"Good\\" winning. I like to see lawyer type of movies and this is one of the best that I have seen. It is a must see for Matt Damon's fans and if you are not his fan, you will become one after seeing this movie. Rudy Baylor (Matt Damon) is a young lawyer, fresh out of law school with all his ideals intact. He has the drive of youth to do right and stick to his principles. Therefore it is refreshing! A good lesson to be learnt from this movie, especially when Rudy said towards the end that he is so 'hot', that he can't retain that position anymore and that after that point it will just be a downturn. There is such a thin line between being a good lawyer and becoming one who will do 'anything' to maintain the reputation of being the best. If you don't understand what I am talking about, get this movie and see for yourself. And for those who understand, this is a 'must-watch' movie!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol's debut album sounds like a record you have in your collection but you haven't played in a very long time because no-one listens to that stuff anymore. <br />And then suddenly you play it and realise how brilliant it is all over again. the curious late 70's doom with flat cold vocals and shimmering guitars seems somehow ahead of its time (yet again).
B00005JKES|5.0|The biggest complaint with this DVD is that it does not include the pilot episode.  So be it.  If you want it, you can order the pilot episode right above this one at this very Web site.  Do not expect much from the extra features here.  The Log Lady intros are nice for a completeness, but the comentaries over the episodes are only interesting for the dedicated film makers.  As with the rest of David Lynch's DVD releases, the material speaks for itself and does not require any additions.  Although this is only the first season, the quality is infinitely better than the atrocious quality in the VHS versions.  Let's hope the rest of the seasons follow soon.

6305308659|3.0|Since I'm a middle-aged guy, I didn't see this movie in the theaters -- I'm a \\"wait until it gets to Blockbuster\\" kind of guy.  So, before I'd even seen it, I was rooting for it at the Oscars, namely because of the camerawork, the visual effects, the gorgeous Technicolor, and the cast.<br />This is a cast to die for:  Joan Allen, Reese Witherspoon, Jeff Daniels, William H. Macy, Don Knotts, Tobey Maguire (I'm not particularly enthused by the last, but he works well with the script).  Therefore, it was with much eager anticipation that I finally saw \\"Pleasantville.\\"<br />Boy, what a letdown!  What a waste of a great, talented cast and crew.  I wasn't prepared for anything terribly mindblowing, but I was at least expecting a quirky, offbeat comedy.<br />Instead, what we get it a strange [copy] of \\"Back to the Future,\\" by the \\"Hair\\" generation, by way of \\"Father Knows Best.\\"  To wit, the movie is basically a political and generational tract by a baby-boomer still stuck in the 1960s, ranting and whining about how lousy and restrictive the 1950s were.  Every cliche on both sides of the fence are dredged out of the past, and the movie becomes a hippie version of Plato's cave allegory.<br />Not that I'm a cheerleader for 1950s family television, but since I was born in the 1960s, I think the last time I checked my watch, it was 2002, and, well, not only are the 50s blissfully over, well, so are the 60s.  Time to move on.<br />But, Gary Ross instead gives the viewer a metaphor that's about as subtle as a sledgehammer cracking open an egg, a ham-handed, cliche-ridden, syrupy and sappy morality play.<br />Though the movie's ostensibly about free will, here's the agenda rub:  It's a morality play about how nothing's black-and-white, morally speaking;  Everything's shades of grey, or rather, color.  Well, you know that's an old liberal saw, and that in itself doesn't bother me, since I hold the Christian Coalition types in equal disdain.  But, the fervor with which Ross delivers this message suggests that if you don't subscribe to his moral vision, then you are morally suspect, which brings us right smack dab to square one, morally speaking. Quite a vicious circle. Nor is this movie accessible to both sides of the political spectrum, like, say, a Frank Capra, or even a Billy Wilder movie:  Ross has a bone to pick with conservatives -- after all, the idyllic \\"Pleasantville\\" in reality is a town in Westchester County, NY, where \\"Reader's Digest\\" is published -- and the not-so-sotto-voce judgment is issued through the clumsy dialogue:  \\"Liberals good, conservatives bad.\\"  You know, I could tune in Rush Limbaugh and hear \\"conservatives good, liberals bad\\" for free.  Somehow, this simplistic and stale argument is not what I expect to shell out my hard-earned money for after a hard day's work.<br />Nonethless, \\"Pleasantville\\" has its virtues, none of which are really due to Ross' heavy-handed scenario nor direction:  Brilliant cinematography, both in black and white and color.  Excellent sets, wardrobe and production design.  Great performances, especially from Macy, Allen and Witherspoon (I love the scene in which Witherspoon suggests to Allen, her TV mom, to try pleasuring herself and the subsequent scene or Allen in the tub; Brilliant set lighting and erotic flavor).  However, these are hardly career performances for any of the cast, and they do their best with a script that is too didactic for any real character development.<br />I wish I could love this movie, because it has an excellent plot premise, which unfortunately got lost in all the moralizing of its theme.  I like my morality tales a shade more plot-driven and much less hectoring, and thus recommend \\"Dead Poets Society\\" as a better alternative for exploring the movie's morality argument, and either \\"The Truman Show\\" or \\"Gattaca\\" for its message on free will.<br />There IS, however, a great lesson to learn from \\"Pleasantville\\": Go heavy on the entertainment and light on the message.
B000002JPA|2.0|James Labrie is a very lucky guy. Owner of a utterly bad, screaming, pop metal voice, he got a job working with some of the more talented, skilled and professional musicians around: Dream Theater.<br />Labrie's voice alone makes the rating for this album drops drastically. To say h e has an \\"operratic voice\\" must be a bad joke... If you wanna hear \\"operatic\\", then go for Michael Kiske or Bruce Dickinson. If you wanna hear a metal singer knowing how and when to scream and use falsettos, go for Rob Halford. In short, go anywhere, except for James Labrie. The best parts of this album is when he keeps his mouth shut.<br />The music is strong and complex as always is the case for Dream Theater. No matter how good it is, it's definitely not for any taste

0345446798|5.0|I've been slipping in paragraphs of this book on the bus, on on breaks. I've re-read several parts. <br />I was working with my dear old 7 year old BC-X last night - she's very mellow, a good girl who my trainer said would do anything for me if I knew how to tell her, but I've always had problems grooming her; she just curls into a hard ball of muscle that is impossible to brush (and believe me, she can hold that position for hours if it will get her out of something she doesn't like). <br />Just by reading this book I extrapolated a better approach - I tend to stand over her and get frustrated - the pitch of my voice changes as I whine repeatedly at her to stand up.<br />So I took out the vocal commands and used body language. I sat on the floor with my back towards her (this made her instantly curious). She came to me and I was able to brush her, give her a treat and praise her. I only made her hang out for a few minutes at a time, but by the end of the evening, I had given her a complete brushing without any curling up, cringing or pathetic shivering.<br />Next challenge: Nail Clipping.
B00003CXTG|1.0|The same old Hollywood 'blockbuster' flag waving tripe, guaranteed to make huge money appealing to an ignorant US public. If you have a 70+ IQ or want a proper film rather than a love story acted by wooden puppets, save yourself two and a half hours and dont bother with this.
B000006OS2|1.0|I agree with everyone who has commented about Goodtimes DVDs.  You could do better with an old 8MM camera version of the movie being aired on TBS.<br />I have a copy made from the original movie prior to VHS release, and like the estate version, I wish someone would do a DVD letterbox that every Wayne fan could really enjoy.
B000005J56|5.0|I don't think so. This is one of those rare CDs with a presence that makes me feel like I'm sitting in on the session. I can practically visualize the size and shape of the room and the position of the singers and instruments. Granted, the treble frequencies suffer from a certain digital harshness, but the mix and ambience more than make up for it. Considering the circumstances of the recording, the producers and technicians are to be commended for doing a great job. Any problem with sound quality may well be the result of post-production mastering. I must confess that I have a four speaker system that brings out the best in most recordings. Nevertheless, in comparison to other CDs with a more natural high end, this album stands out for its sense of \\"liveness.\\"
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is one of the best animated films of all time. It's a great joy to see the three different versions of the film on one DVD.  The Special Edition, with it's restored musical number is wonderful, as is the director's commentary.  Who knew that Regis Philbin had auditioned for the Beast???  The Theatrical Release and NY Film Festival versions are both wonderful in their own right. The Film Festival version is interesting because of the look of the unfinished animation mixed in with the finished animation.  Very, very interesting.  The DVD of extras has some very interesting looks at the art of putting together an animated film and all the work that it takes.  I was also surprised to learn that the Disney folks were rushed in finishing the film, because they only worked on it for two years, as opposed to the 3-4 that they usually take now for an animated film.  <BR>Anyway, get this disc as soon as possible. It's irresistable look, sound and extras make it a must have for any library of DVD's.
B00000ITOY|5.0|Great for sorting, development of small motor skills, and shape and color recognition.  This is a wonderful, open-ended toy.  Beautifully made and sturdy.  Ours has been with us through three kids and 6 years and still looks as good as ever.  I wish more companies put as much thought into their toys.  Plan Toys makes some of the best toys you can buy and they are reasonably priced if you consider how long they'll last.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|In short, this was one of the funniest animated movies I have seen in a looooong time. This is ONE way to cure kids from being afraid of monsters in their closet! In fact, kids may begin looking inside their closets in hopes of spotting one! <br />The pace moves along steadily and I never got bored. Time seemed to fly by as I watched. <br />Here is a movie that adults and children alike will watch over and over and over ... <br />Great movie!
0060922583|3.0|Holy smokes, Mulder, the truth really is out there--wa~y out there!<BR>I found the first few chapters outlining the book's theoretical basis absolutely fascinating. I'm not a physicist, so I am in no position to judge the validity of the author's position, but as a layman I found the possibilities truly inspiring. <BR>Then I came to the chapter on 'miracles', in which Talbot cites an extensive list of so-called well-documented incidents of bonafied miracles (religious zealots being hit in the stomach with a sledge hammer so hard it cracks the mortar in the wall behind them, with no sign of injury; people walking through fire without being burned; a girl who could make an entire forest appear and disappear at will; and so on) and my willingness to give him the benefit of the doubt began to falter. So, I decided to check up on just one of his miracles, just to see what I could find.<BR>Case in point: Sai Baba, an Indian guru who claims to be the incarnation of God. According to Talbot (who only bothered to consult one source) Sai Baba can produce holy ash out of thin air, create precious gems with the wave of his hand,  pluck fresh fruit from baren trees out of season, heal the sick, and so on, etc. And he's alive today. Eager to find out more about this actual living God in our midst, I did a quick Internet search. Well, it took all of ten minutes to dig up enough dirt on this guy to fill a dump truck: eye witness accounts by people who had seen him palming objects or hiding them in his chair (backed by video tape evidence), testimony by young men who had been sexually molested by him, a suspicious multiple murder at the ashram of people who had fallen out of favor with Sai Baba, and so on. Some God! Yet Talbot refers to Sai Baba uncritically throughout his book as evidence to support his more outlandish claims.<BR>Talbot says that if science is to develop a more complete model of the universe, it must be willing to accept subjective experience as valid evidence. Butdoes this include being terminally gullible? His thesis seems to be that if you are willing to believe anything you hear, than anything is possible. Sorry, but in my universe, that just don't wash! This book is pseudo-science: it adopts the language and posturings of real science, without any of the intellectual rigor that lies at the core of scientific understanding. <BR>That said, I must add that it is very good pseudo-science, interesting and intellectually provocative. I've been through a few doors myself in my life, and the theories presented in this book do give me a fingerhold for trying to understand these experiences. So, for all you Scullys out there, my advice is this: leave your shinola detector in the drawer and treat yourself to a little intellectual fantasy. It might even change your perspective on a few things.
B00006AG5N|3.0|Elvis will always be known for his rock 'n' roll.  What he'll be forgotten for are his sappy ballads.  About half of the songs here are hip-swingin' hits and half are sleep-inducing croons, so splitting the difference gives a 2 1/2.  But then add in the &quot;Little Less Conversation&quot; remix and it jumps to a 3.  After hearing this, I'm hoping for some more Elvis/techno mixes.
B00006J3T4|4.0|Mark Knoefler's talent is shared beautifully in a selection of very laid-back songs, some of which reminded me of &quot;Brother Where Art Thou.&quot;  It's one of his best.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy his soothing as honey voice in some very old-fashioned, deep-south Americana songs!!
B000000OAA|5.0|For those who wish to get a good taste of the varied sounds Queen produced and the quality of their music, this is the album you're looking for.
B000002KEV|5.0|The first half hour is simply the finest music ever recorded
B000002JSJ|4.0|Not their best, but look who we're talking about. This is Led Zeppelin who may have never wrote a bad song, but certainly wrote some boring ones (Royal Orleans). Still their are the gems Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine, which in my hubmle opinions is one of the best covers of all time.  For Your LIfe is also overlooked quite a bit for having a outstanding guitar riff.
B00004Z459|5.0|I Simply have to say that they have the words to get to me... You must have felt this way because I did lots of times, you know when you are so angry and that there is so much hate in you, about something or especially someone, and there is simply NO WAY you can put it in words to get it all out, well THEY put it in these words. I don't know how they do it but anywas it's the greatest CD you'll ever found. It's not a simple CD to me but it's some kind of memento about lots of things, anyways ... write me back if u feel like it, cya later guys, <BR>                                      ,Dark-Slash22
B0000399WI|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I went with a couple of friends because it was at the... theater.  To be honest, I really didn't even know what the movie was about because it was in and out of the first-run theater quickly.<br />The acting is this movie is excellent!  You really feel for the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  The movie takes the viewer on a wild ride of emotions - mostly sadness and compassion, but in the end is very uplifting and positive movie.<br />I highly reccomend it to everyone!
B0000065O1|4.0|Ok, I must say this is not the best fitness video in the world but it has some really good parts so I hv always come back to it. I hv actually bought 2 tapes in 9 years, one for my home in UK, one for my home in Hong Kong, to make sure I will do some exercises even on holiday!<BR> <BR>Personally I always skip the stomach exercises 'coz they are really agony(and hard to do), I guess that's why it's called &quot;the next challenge&quot;. However, I don't have Cindy Crawford's 1st tape so I cannot compare.<br />I especially find the arms and chest exercises very useful, I have more than 10 fitness tape at home and this has by far the best arms and chest workout. The legs(cardio) exercises are great if you are very fit, but if you have not exercised for a long time I suggest you do them very slowly 'coz they really get your heart pumping. I am not into really fast cardio exercises so I have to stop for abt 5 mins (instead of 1 minute rest time)before going into the next stage. <br />The best thing about this video is that Cindy Crawford is really working out with you! Cindy Crawford has bigger bum and thighs compare to a lot of models, it gives me such motivation when realising not everyone is born slim, even a supermodel like Cindy Crawford has to work out. I also owned the tape by Claudia Schiffer and Elle Macpherson: Claudia Schiffer didn't sweat at all in her tape, and her voice is so soft and flat and lack of motivation, whereas Elle Machperson didn't do half of the exercises, the difficult parts are all done by her personal trainer. <br />Cindy Crawford - please give us another new tape!
0316666343|2.0|There was a lot of rambling and jumping from one story line to the next. The author never stayed on subject and I felt like the story was incomplete. It took me long time to read it and I felt myself skipping over pages. It was very cliche too. <br />Plot of book was creative but not unique.
B00005RFQ5|5.0|Prince returns to greatness with this album since sinking into<br />mediocrity after the Diamonds and Pearls album. He seamlessly weaves all musical styles with a creativity that is unmatched. The songs don't follow a format, that's why the album is so refreshing. This album is very mellow, so if you like the hard funky stuff, don't buy it.  The vocals tell a story in a chorus like manner giving the album a broadway play feel.  Guys, if you put this album on when you're chillin' with your girl, it will blow her mind. It's just too bad that Prince is not given enough recognition for his musical contributions.  Like all true geniuses, he won't get his just due until after he's dead.
B000063UR2|2.0|One of the greatest Fantasy movies ever made absolutely ruined by the director's cut! The alternate ending makes the first disk (Director's Cut) totally unwatchable. It completely ruined the entire movie for me. I'd say the DVD is worth buying just to have this classic on DVD, but I found out that the Dolby Digital/DTS sound track is only on the first disk! I buy DVD's because of the superior sound and this version does not deliver it. The first disk and the price needs to drop to make this DVD worthwhile.
B00006RG7F|5.0|Diana is a great lady. Her songs are just wonderful
B00005NWM3|5.0|Nickleback's silver side up , in my opinion, is one of the years best rock albums. Many people would argue and say they are to weak or to wussy but the riffs and lyrics on his album are awsome!The songs are so catchy and I listen to it everyday. GO AND BUY THIS CD!
0312979479|5.0|This book was the best mystery book I have ever read, well actually it is the only mystery book I have ever read.  The plot was great, the character were exellent...
B00005JKED|5.0|...<br />... When I saw Training Day, I was sold on Denzel. He was the best because I kept buying what he was saying, and I kept (in my mind) giving him the benefit of the doubt that, even when he was clearly corrupt, he was still doing things in the interest of good and in the interest of the community. He had me believing his role, and that's what made the difference, that's what made him rise above Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.<br />... Denzel's role as Alonzo Harris is similar to Michael Douglas' role as Gordon Gekko in Wall Street. Both characters are manipulative, greedy, and corrupt, while both actors are convincing, real, and believable. That is why both have won best actor for their respective roles, and are well deserved.<br />Anyway, Training Day is a very good movie, it takes you on a ride through the mean streets of LA. It is clever, conniving, and downright scary at times. Denzel's performance is flawless, Ethan Hawke is convincing, and it was great to see Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre in minor roles. I gave it a 10 out of 10.
0446608955|5.0|I am not sure any book has ever touched my heart soo deeply as this one did. Yes, the book seems predictable at times...but the author has done a splendid job in expressing emotions and relationships and its hard to put the book away until you finish it.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I missed a chance to see Miss Krall last May in Ft. Lauderdale. This album helps me forgive myself for that faux pas. 'Live In Paris' also makes up for the overly lush, orchestrated last release, 'Look of Love', that I had to reluctantly rate as 4 stars in my review. I've wanted an album like this from Miss Krall for a long time. It was worth the wait. I'm just going to make it simple for you--buy this album, pop it in your CD player, put on headphones, light some candles, break out a bottle of French wine, turn down the lights and it is almost like you are there in the Paris audience. It is lush, but in a different way than the previously mentioned album. The lushness comes from Miss Krall's voice-not an orchestra. Her ensemble is pure magic, never overpowering the most unique phrasing that is part of Miss Krall's musical identity. For now I will settle for this album as a substitution for actually seeing her in person. Believe me, I won't let that chance pass me by again.
B0000026UV|5.0|I was grabbed right off the bat with the first number and it just gets better from there. These two seem like such a natural pairing it's a shame they only did it once. A sequel album would have been wonderful.<br />If you're only thinking about buying this album, stop thinking and start ordering. You will be as taken as I was when you first pop in your player.
B00006FDCD|4.0|o.k. i am a great fan of wide screen films - IF THEY WERE MADE THAT WAY!!! <br>the story itself is my all time favorite stephen king mini-series adaptation. (as usual the book is much better, but getting king from page to screen has always been a hard thing to do)  <br />i have this thing about clowns-hate 'em. period. they freak me out, i don't know why...so, when the book came out i grabbed it up as did everyone else in the 80s and ingested it whole! when i heard about the mini-series, i was leary of it till i heard that tim curry would be IT. he is perfectly cast in this and is absolutly menacing!<br />i gave this dvd 4 stars cuz i had to take one away for pretending this was ever a wide screen film. the practice of pan-n-scan on wide screen films is bad enough (and we now usually get both options to choose from) but letterboxing a tv movie or the dasterdly work of letterboxing a theatrical movie (as they did with gone with the wind) is apauling! it DOES cut into the picture and only gives anti-wide screen people amunition for their propiganda pages.
0679736646|5.0|I started to read this novel and just couldn't put it down.  Dick is the master of suspense, of all things surreal, and of all things SF.  This book, simply put, is awesome.  To try to describe it in 1,000 words is useless.  Go read it now.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|I'll keep this short. This is a FANTASTIC DVD! The only problem is if you watch your old VHS and the new \\"mastered\\" DVD you'll see that they over simplified the colors on the new DVD. Where there once was shadow and texture and dark colors. It is now replaced with overly bright, no shadows, and flatness. Its kinda strange that something so old was better looking old. You'll see what I'm talking about when you see old clips that are on the DVD (see the Celine video on the DVD or the clips on some of the gmaes). Its kinda sad to see them make this movie look like some of those cheap straight to video movies Disney makes. Oh well, its a nice package of extras but hoooold on to the old VHS's until they fix this.
0790731452|1.0|Tim Burton is a master of visual storytelling who, in HIS OWN WORDS (from an episode of the IFC TV series &quot;The Directors&quot;), couldn't tell a good script from a bad script if it fell on him (I'm paraphrasing here, but the message was the same).  However, early in his career, he was partners with producer Denise DiNovi, who COULD spot good material.  As a result, he made the stunning, quality motion pictures &quot;Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,&quot; &quot;Beetlejuice,&quot; &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands,&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns.&quot;  Then, after a falling out, DiNovi split and he made the visually stunning, awful films &quot;Ed Wood&quot; (yeah, I know many people will disagree with that but, personally I though it was pretty crummy apart from Martin Landau and Johnny Depp's performances... maybe one could call that title &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;pretty good&quot;), &quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; and this waste of time.  I won't even include &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; because that was a Henry Selick film which Burton was not even involved with during production (even though Burton gets all the credit for it).  What a waste of talent.  He needs to find someone to fill DiNovi's shoes because all of these films' paper-thin scripts sink his still-impressive visuals.  Great to look at but empty.

B0000542D2|5.0|The budget was about $500,000 and it took less than four months to complete. But in 1964, when \\"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT\\" was released in the US, it was immediately clear that something much more than just a pop culture phenomenon was in the process of unfolding on a global scale.  Maybe it had something to do with the first wave of healing that came after the assassination of JFK.<br />Whatever it was, there was some kind of mystical connection to a widely shared emotion that lifted the Beatles and their music to iconic levels of the highest order.  And kept them there.  There simply had never been anything like them or their songs.<br />As they grew artistically, their music morphed -- celebration, exploration and introspection all became elements of their remarkable catalog of songs. But more than anything else, what struck such a chord in \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" was the simple ebullience for life itself.  In the film, each Beatle was quickly defined: John Lennon as wry and sarcastic, Paul McCartney as witty and cute, George Harrison as thoughtful and quiet and Ringo Starr as idiosyncratic and outlandish.<br />Not only that, their collective energy, irreverence and self-deprecating wit was perfectly mirrored in the fresh and unexpected film style that pretended to capture a typical day in the life of the fab four. With jump cuts and in camera effects, the faux documentary was not without a dash of farce and a pinch of anarchism.  And all in glorious black and white.  Clearly, this was not another cheeseball Elvis movie clone.  Could it be, well, art and entertainment?<br />In early preproduction, Lennon and McCartney were instructed to write six songs for what was then an untitled film based on a screenplay by Alun Owen.  Lennon encouraged the filmmakers to base the title on one of Ringo's witticisms.  When that was locked in, he and McCartney came up with the title song overnight.<br />Much credit must go to former Beatles' manager Brian Epstein who was no doubt deluged with film offers.  And to director Richard Lester and producer Walter Shenson who backed risky creative decisions that made this film a timeless entertainment that still works its magic on a new generation of Beatles fans.<br />In honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of the band's first single, \\"Love Me Do,\\" in Great Britain, Miramax is distributing a superb two disc DVD set -- almost three years in the making -- that not only includes a flawless, digitally remastered film transfer, but also \\"Give me Everything,\\" a companion disc anthology that features hours of rare and new material -- so much in fact that this column does not have the space to detail it.

B000002O4S|3.0|When I saw &quot;Back to the Future&quot; as a teenager, not only did it become one of my all-time favourite movies, but it also played a major part in turning me on to movie scores; I know a lot of people bought it for the two Huey Lewis cuts and the other songs, but Alan Silvestri's score was what drove me to get this. Both Silvestri and the score have many fans - there's actually a website petitioning to get the actual music from the movie released, as the 11 minutes or so on the soundtrack [the short main theme and the 8-minute &quot;Overture&quot; - basically a suite, mostly taken from the storm climax] aren't heard that way in the movie; the version of the theme over the end credits has a more thrilling ending than the album version, for instance. (I heard some sound clips of the Varese re-recording and was NOT impressed.)<br />The songs are okay, but nothing really essential; more of the score would have made this a 5-star release. But fans can take heart from &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; [finally released after 18 years]... we might get lucky!

B000068CNX|5.0|Season Two of Friends sees the consummation of the Ross &amp; Rachel relationship which is the major theme that has run throughout the show's nine year run.  Season One's cliffhanger where Rachel finds out Ross' feelings for her and she goes to the airport to meet him on his way back from China is dealt with beautifully.  It seems that Ross has met a former college associate, Julie, in China and they are an item.  The tables are now turned as it is Rachel who is secretly pining for an unknowing Ross.  This is a brilliant move and the humor in the situation is mined for the first few episodes.  Ross finds out about Rachel's feelings for him when he retrieves a phone message that a drunken Rachel left for him claiming she's over him.  They fight over this, but in the end, Ross knocks on Central Perk's door in a rainstorm for their first kiss.  The road to love isn't smooth as Rachel finds a pros and cons list Ross has made about her and Julie, but after seeing an old video of Monica and hers prom night in which Ross was going to stand in as a date for Rachel where her boyfriend was thought to be ditching her (this is a classic episode and in the video we see a fat Monica, a pre nose job Rachel and Ross has jeri curled hair and cheesy mustache).  The Ross &amp; Rachel relationship of course dominates the season, but there are many other hilarious subplots including Joey getting his big break as a soap actor in Days Of Our Lives which leads to him moving out of the apartment and Chandler getting a new roommate Eddie (played brilliantly by the underrated Adam Goldberg) who at first seems perfect, but turns out to be psychotic.  Also, Monica starts her relationship with Dr. Richard Burke (Tom Selleck, who shows a rare comedic side).  Season two of Friends is yet another full of great performances by the entire cast, funny guest stars including Julia Roberts, superb writing and worth repeated viewings.
B00005AQGH|5.0|The fact that all of his rivals are now praising him all the time, talking about how much they admired him, and some using his beats would of never happened if he was still alive. Rap has changed so much it doesn't make sense. Everybody is rapping with everybody and everybody claims they all are the best. Its so commercialize and so many record labelz have monopolize the rap industry its just not as good as it once was. This album is my personal favorite of all of his music cuz he lets them all know how he feels and how it is. In my opinion you can't compare Notorious BIG to PAC. No one can say Biggie wasn't a good rapper but a lot people don't feel him cuz the simple fact is Pac put it down better.  This CD from BEGINNINING TO END is Pac at his best. Every song is good if not great.  Pac's muzic will be around a hundred years from now still banging like yesterday cuz he's simply the best.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I have not been a fan of where Krall's handlers have been taking her recently.  In The Look of Love, I thought the creative artist got lost in the packaging of the beauty queen.<br />Anyone who has seen her live knows she has chops at the piano which equal (at least) the great voice.  So I purchased this CD (I'm addicted so there was never a choice about 'not' purchasing) with some trepidation.  However, the opening bars on the first cut, I Love Being Here With You, told me this was going to be fun!<br />If you're not a Krall fan and want to know what all the buzz is about - get this CD and you'll know why.  This lady can sing, she can play, and she can work an audience like a politician.<br />The only downside of this CD (if you can call it that) is that you can't use it for background music - it won't be ignored.  So just crank the volume up and have a good ole time!
0441003257|3.0|Neil Gaiman. Terry Pratchett. Two great authors, surely this book can be nothing less than fantastic.  So I thought. I was expecting a lot when I picked this one up. Perhaps I expected a little too much.<br />An excellent start to a great storyline: that scene at Eden. Dialogue that brought pure joy, and situations that are very much Gaiman and Pratchett. I ate eagerly into the first half of the book, but towards the end, it just started to drag. The whole procession, that began so wonderfully, started straggling, and while those Horsemen brought refreshments, I had to force myself to continue reading. And mainly because I hate leaving things unfinished.<br />Too many cooks spoil the broth? I'm not sure. I love Pratchett but am not experienced in Gaiman, so I wouldn't really know. Perhaps they got a little tired. Maybe they just weren't able to put their ideas across properly. (Highly unlikely. Even if Gaiman wasn't, Pratchett's a master at it.) I'd recommend this book to anyone who <br />1) likes Gaiman,<BR>2) likes Pratchett,<BR>3) likes them both, or<BR>4) is in something of a great need to just read something.<BR>(That is, you'd read anything, but you draw the line at a certain point, for example, say, Anne Rice, or something. No offence to Anne Rice lovers. I'm not a fan of hers, so the previous example is just, uh, in relation to myself.)
B00005JL2O|2.0|Because I enjoyed the first two Austin Powers movies so much, I ignored all the bad flack \\"Goldmember\\" was getting and charged ahead to the theater to see it anyway. Man, what a letdown! The whole movie was a sad, bad parody of the first two. There's even a \\"joke\\" near the end where Ozzie Osbourne complains that they're doing the same stuff they did in the first two. I made Ozzie's observation less than half an hour into the movie, but I wasn't laughing at either that realization or the lame jokes.<br />I don't care what's on the DVD, it's not gonna be worth the [money] New Line is asking for unless the special features include the missing plot and the [money] I paid to see this [garbage]. I believe this overpricing of the DVD is New Line's attempt to artificially attach worthiness to this travesty.  (\\"It's not worthy!  It's not worthy!\\") The truly funny moments are too rare to be worth the asking price. I still love Mike Myers, but I'm afraid you won't laugh WITH him, only AT him, if you laugh at all...

0671042858|2.0|Don't read \\"The Girl who loved Tom Gordon\\" if you are looking for Stephen King's stories of horror and gore. This is the story of a girl called Trisha McFarland that gets lost in the woods while in a hiking trip with her mother and brother and then tries to find her way home.<br /><br />Although the back cover says that \\"she becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror\\" that is not true.<br />The reader is the one that gets lost in a maze of monotony and boredom that could have used some of the thrills and chills that you usually find in other King's books.<br /><br />The book lacks suspense and the \\"all-too-real enemy\\" is not nearly half as terrifying as other King's creations.<br />While the writing style of King is great, as usual, the plot of this book is really monotonous because he spends too many pages detailing Trisha's wanderings thru the forest.<br /><br />King could have involved the enemy more in the plot and spend more pages describing the hard moments that her family was going thru instead of telling us so much about her misfortunes in the Appalachian Trail.<br /><br />King also could have detailed the efforts of the search party to introduce more adventure and thrills to the book.<br />Overall I think this book is more suited to introduce teenagers to King's books than for King's fans craving the classic suspenseful terror stories of gore and blood.<br /><br />Not worth the money for those of us used to his classic stories.
0807281956|5.0|It's really a wonderful story! The elements of the book are all around the magic world or the adventure travel that a brave boy had experienced, that seems just the traditional miracle stories and you might be in doubt if it's really so attractive. But I will show you that it is different with traditional magic story.<br />Harry Potter has some fresh ideas through the story and I am so impressed by these plots. Let me take some examples, the ¡§Sorting hat¡¨ for defining the students into different house, and also the hat can speak, it is really interesting. Moreover, the special sports at the school those Harry Potter studies in, Quidditch; it's a very exciting game. The attendance of Harry Potter to the Quidditch team can show his talent and also his brave against the blackness side.<br />This book is very good on handling the plots to make the story to be very attractive. It really makes me extremely nervous when Harry Potter¡¦s uncle resist to let him receive the letter from the school, it makes me also feel angry as same as Potter and also very nervous to know about can Potter receive the letter finally? ...<br />After reading the ¡§Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone¡¨, I nearly rushed to read the Book 2 ¡§Harry Potter Chamber of Secret¡¨, because I really addicted to the book. I know you won¡¦t believe my comment before reading the book, but I¡¦m sure you won¡¦t disapprove my words after you have read it. Do you want to proof my words? Please rush to read the ¡§Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone¡¨.

1558908846|5.0|As soon as I saw the trailer for Judge Dredd , I knew I had to go to see it.  After I walked out of the theatre (when J.D ended)  , I didn't feel cheated , I felt entertained.  <BR>Sly Stallone makes a perfect &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; but I have to admit I really , really enjoyed his &quot;brother&quot;'s performance  , Rico (Armand Assante). Armand has some really classic lines like when he is asked what is the meaning of life &quot;It ends.&quot;  Really great stuff. Jurgen Prochnow (that captain from Das Boot) stars as well as a treacherous Chief Justice Griffon.  His acting style is so intense and believable &quot;No one survived the shuttle wreck , do I make myself clear!&quot; Fantastic.The sets and the quality of the acting add the experience.<br />The DVD picture and sound quality are excellent and the studio actually bothered to throw that fantastic trailer they aired back in the theatres.  All in all , a great movie at a great price . Enjoy.

It reminded me of old comedy movies, where the simplest things, if put in the right place will make you laugh till you cry.<BR>The plot is quite simple, a bunch of shaolin masters who got lousy jobs since their master died, will team back again to win a soccer grand prize of 1,000,000$, and each one of them has his own \\"Super Power\\". The best part is when they start facing stronger and stronger opponents; you get the best showdown ever in martial arts and special effects.<BR>Long story short, go and watch it, you won't regret it.
B00000K0E5|5.0|This was one of the greatest Bonds ever. It starts when James Bond(Pierce Brosnan) goes on a mission and teams up with Agent 006 Alec Trevalyan(Sean Bean) against Col. Ourormov. Then Trevelyan is \\"killed\\" by Ouromov and Bond escapes the facility. NINE YEARS LATER Bond meets Xenia(Famke Jannsen), an assistant to a criminal named Janus. Xenia and Ouromov, who is now a general, steal a helicopter and head for Severnaya, Russia. Ouromov zaps Severnaya with the Goldeneye blast and then steals the Goldeneye. There is one survivor, a woman named Natalya Simonova(Izabella Scorupco). Meanwhile, Bond travels to St. Petersburg and gets information from Jack Wade(Joe Don Baker) and Valentin Zukovsky(Robbie Coltrane) of where to find Janus. Then, Bond goes to a yard full of statues and finds Alec Travelyan! Bond finds that Alec is Janus and portayed MI6. Bond is then captured and put in a cell with Natalya and it is up to Bond and Natalya to save the day. This movie has a great ending, but I will not give it away.
B000000I02|5.0|I first heard this record in 1976, though I think it came out earlier. Astounding recording. It brought keyboard player Dave Stewart (Egg) to my attention. If you look at the front cover, there is a man in a wheel chair. That is Robert Wyatt from Soft Machine, who was the musician who inspired many in this band. Dark, yet melodic... punctuated subtly with hints of aggression, this recording has always been one of my favorites and will continue to be so. I hope some of the 20-somethings can let themselves go and check this out. This is not dance music people, but smart and executed with the talents of that time. Pure art rock on the dark side of the...

It features these songs: Wanna Be Startin' Something, Baby Be Mine, The Girl is Mine, Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T(Pretty Young Thing), and The Lady in my Life. I've said it once and I'll say it again, This album is one of the best!
B0026ICAOS|4.0|In Gaitlan Nebraska three years earlier, it seemed like a nice town until a boy named Issac (John Franklin) who happens to be a young preacher in training was told by a demon posing as god to command him and other children with teens especially Malachai (Courtney Gains) to murder all the adults in town. The town has been nothing but deserted with no adults around for a traveling couple named Vicky (Linda Hamilton) and Burt (Peter Horton) are about to find out the terrifying unholy secret of the killer child cult.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining and thrilling Stephen King adaptations is a flawed but quite enjoyable supernatural shocker. Based on a short story made by Stephen King, this has gained a cult following plus a legion of sequels and remakes to follow. The acting is OK but Hamilton really shines here in the same year she was in The Terminator but the children here are creepy as hell but it does have a cheap and funny ending though, it's still worth watching.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers a quality high-def picture and sound quality to a 25 year old movie! the extras here are terrific such as trailer with audio commentary, BD-exclusive interviews, featurettes, original storyboard art, fast film facts, original title sequence art and poster-and-still gallery.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"The Omen\\", \\"Pet Sematary\\", \\"The Messengers\\", \\"Dark Night of the Scarecrow\\", \\"Let The Right One In\\", \\"The Wicker Man (1973)\\", \\"Village of the Damned (1960)\\", \\"Children of the Damned\\" and \\"
B00004XONN|5.0|I just wanted to write this review for those people who thought this CD was bunch of unintelligible sounds on the keyboard, because the music is a lot more complicated than that.  I think one of the reason this CD can be somewhat inaccessible(esp. compared to thier prior album), is that radiohead is doing things that are musically rather sophisticated, and in doing so they may have lost thier audience.  I am just going to site some examples.<br />First of all, the first song, if you know anything about music is modal.  It's in a phrygian mode.  What does that mean?  It means that the chord progression is not what you typically hear in pop music.  Modal is usually primarily in Renaissance, and there was a resurgence of that in Jazz with Miles Davis.  And modal music doesnt have the predictable cadences so it's easy for the listenr to feel like they are lost, but that's how modal music sound like, they dont have definite resolution.<br />If you look at Morning Bell, the rhtym and the form of the song is highly unusual.  First of all, its in  5/8.  Most pop music are in 4/4 or 3/4.  I don't know if there are any pop music out there that are in 5/4, that is highly unusal.  Again, it will be something that say a jazz musician or a classical composer will use, and people might get lost because the rhythm has a extra beat at the end like a hickup.<br />Most of the songs in the album don't have a particular form, and that is very unusal too.  Most pop music have cleary distinct section that you can automatically recognize.  In a lot of ways, the kid A is not so accesible to the audience, because they are much more sophsiticated than any popular music out there.  Well that shouldn't come as suprise, because Radiohead themselves claimed that they are infulenced by Miles Davis and even admit that they are trying to write music like him.  <br />I really think radiohead is pushing music in a really intersting direction, and in doing so, they might have lost some of the audience,because what they write is no longer as accessible and catchy like it was in the bends and pablo honey.  I am truely grateful for bands like radiohead who is willing to try new things out, take chances, and really grow as creative artists.  I mean most pop and rock musicians only play music in one way, and in the accepted style, and its not creative at all.  Radiohead is truly one of the few creative ones out there.
B00006IU73|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Wilson (vocals, guitar, mastermind behind PT), Richard Barbieri (keyboards and sound effects), Colin Edwin (bass), Gavin Harrison (drums - replacing recently departed Chris Maitland).<br /><br />THE DISC: 12 songs running at approximately 68 minutes. A 14-page booklet containing song lyrics and assorted pictures with faces scratched off. All words and music written by Steve Wilson (and 2 songs are cowritten by Barbieri and Edwin). Video: \\"Strip The Soul\\" playable on your PC. An import of the same album is available containing 2 bonus tracks (\\"Drown With Me\\" and \\"Chloroform\\"). 2002 - Lava Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Hands down, this is my favorite disc from 2002. It stayed in my car CD player for a month when I first bought it. Perfect in most senses... crisp flawless production, wonderful vocals and harmonies, fantastic musicianship, and great song writing. Porcupine Tree, in my opinion, has always been hard to classify - definitely progressive, rock infused, beautiful instrumental moments painted thru song that wisk you away to somewhere else. Most anything from PT's library begs to be listened to with a nice set of headphones (deep rich textured guitars, layers of vocals, and sound effects galore). There are a few \\"pop\\" tunes that perhaps should have made it to the FM airwaves... \\"Trains\\" is the best 'pop', and \\"Blackest Eyes\\". I sit and scratch my head and wonder - why the heck aren't these guys more popular? Lyrics on \\"In Absentia\\" are twisted... a concept album following a serial killer from childhood. If you saw The Tree in concert on this tour, you'd have seen the slide show while the band played - and the complete picture of the album cover - it's the main character losing his mind. New drummer Gavin Harrison doesn't miss a beat and dare I say he's as good or better than his predecessor. Having seen many concerts and always gravitating towards the drummers... I put Harrison right up there with the chops of Neil Peart and Mike Portnoy. Songs are soft, then hard, then soft again... covering all aspects of music. If track one's \\"Blackest Eyes\\" doesn't grab you with it's driving guitars in the first 60 seconds of the song, than nothing will. The acoustic \\"Lips Of Ashes\\" and piano tune \\"Heartattack In A Layby\\" are simply beautiful. The bass guitar steals the show with songs \\"Strip The Soul\\" and \\"3\\". I have most (10) of PT's discs and this is my new favorite. The video (\\"Strip The Soul\\") that comes on the CD is dark, atmospheric and disturbing. It reminds me of those whacked-out hospital dream scenes from the movie \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" with Tim Robbins. Eerie, but cool. Every song on \\"In Absentia\\" is wonderful - absolutely no filler to be found. In my music library of over 1300 discs, this one is easily in the top 5. Addicting... a great album. *Also - if Porcupine Tree is touring in a city near you - go see them live... they are equally impressive on stage!n hard, then soft again... covering all aspects of music.

B00005YXZH|1.0|After hearing this was the best album on the year by one of my friends, I went out and bought it. And do you know what, he is no longer my friend. This is the worst album I have heard in a long time. And a warning to everyone out there, there are references to drinking and drugs, for shame Mr. Tweedy. Why do critics continue to give credit for inventiveness. Give me the same beat in every song and lyrics about how to move my body. Wilco should get together with Brittany's producer and make a real album. Oh and Mr. Tweedy heavy metal was popular 10 years and you wouldn't miss your innocence if you weren't going drugs and drinking as your lyrics suggest.
B000002NIW|5.0|all right...the thing you must note is that all three album's of deftones have almost no resemblance (extra points towards creativity) and yet they all rock the house! White Pony may be a little behind the others just because it lacks the intenseness and focuses more of an art rock kind of style in most songs(save, Feiticera, Street Carp, and Korea). Adrenaline is good for rapcore music.  Around the Fur though is the big one just because of its intenseness and originality.  Deftones truly show what it means to be an alt. metal band in this album.<br />My Own Summer-10-This song is definately one of the few songs put into mainstream that actually is REALLY good. Chino brings it up VERY high and then VERY low VERY good. Bass solos no matter how hard are always good.<br />2.Lhabia-10-Great opener for the song, Deftones bring out this funky beat and then Chino talks and mutters almost to himself. Then the chorus comes and Chino really brings out his point of view on a very melodic/intense level.<br />3.Mascara-8-Strange song. Takes a little to really get into it. Nontheless it is still very good (who ever said 8 was bad?).slows the pace a little bit but the emotions stay true and the guitars and drums stay heavy...just the way we like it<br />4.Around The Fur-10+-This song is INCREDIBLE! The creativity is just to the roof on this one and it pays off.<BR>definatley a fav. for Deftones!<br />5.Ricets-10-The pace is set at grueling and it can't stop. This short but sweet song may sound strange at first, then you'll warm up to it and won't ever cool down from it. Don't you just love Chino's whispers!<br />6.Be Quiet and Drive-10-A less creative, but more rhythmic. Deftones bring out a very delicious car song for this album (as always). A more stereotypical view of a metal band does not hurt the band's rep. at all. It almost boosts it for their ability to make it into something great.<br />7.Lotion-6-Sorry guys. Of all the reviews i've read, all of them give props to lotion.not me. Chino seems to waste his good voice on slurring and pointless screaming. The only song that is actually, OK. Despite the rest of the song the chorus is actually appealling and the band actually does it good through-out the entire song.<br />8.Dai the Flu-9-Good Stuff. Slow start. Again seems to waste his voice on slurring, the difference is the pitch of him against the band. Lotion was just an ugly clash of heads. This seems to put more meaning in his words(if i could understand what they were).<br />9.Headup-10-Very enjoyable, loud song. soulfy's Max against deftone's Chino, very good combo. One of my favorite quotes comes from this song...\\"walk into this world with your head up high\\"...though in a more harsh but smashing tone.<br />10.MX-10-you can't help but love the band Deftones on this song, its impossible not too. Very good beats and background music. Chino puts in a good part of it too but its the band that puts the umph in it. Chino's best part to me is when he laughs and sort of gurgles at the same time. Abe Cunningham's (drummer) wife makes a good appearance too as she responds to Chino while the chorus is on.<br />11.Damone-10-Who's to say bonus tracks aren't GREAT! This is definately a very good song that i look forward to at the end. Chino makes up his OK singing from the same/previous song. He melodies his way into the guitar and drum lines and does it very well i might have to add. Though it takes 32:36 seconds to get to this song from MX...it's definately worth it. <br />Now you've heard MY view of this cd...so you should GET THIS ALBUM!

But here we have \\"The Rising.\\" I can only think of a couple of artists that could write about the events of September 11th without sounding maudlin and Bruce is one of them (Dylan is the other). Honestly, I've never really been a Springsteen fan, but I've always respected what he does: making the records he wants to make and connecting with a large audience. And this one has certainly connected with me--both musically and lyrically. But even if you didn't listen to the words, you would still get it, because this is a recording you feel more than you hear. Everything that we believe rock n' roll should do is on this CD.

B000002L9Y|5.0|It may not be \\"Rumours\\", but among the albums of Fleetwood Mac's classic lineup, no other even comes close to \\"Tango In The Night.\\" None of the emotionalism of of its predecessors is lost, and with most of the infighting and drug use behind them, these five have never sounded better (except perhaps for 'The Dance', but we had to wait ten years!).<br />Ms. Nicks never seems to change, though her distinct voice seems to be what brings her fans back one studio album after another, and she doesn't disappoint. The synthesized \\"Seven Wonders\\" is a standout in her catalog and \\"When I See You Again\\", echoes her solo work (\\"Leather & Lace\\") while carrying us into the close. Plus \\"Welcome To The Room\\", is intriguing, despite that its lyrical connection to \\"Sara\\" isn't clear.<br />Mr. Buckingham chose to make this album his temporary swan song, and the five songs created by him show two sides of his songwriting talent: \\"Big Love\\" is a classic in league with \\"Go Your Own Way\\", whose mysterious vibes carry over to both the Mid-Eastern motif of \\"Caroline\\", and the title track, which with its illustrious guitar solo, recalls the art rock glory of \\"I'm So Afraid\\". On the flip side, \\"Family Man\\" takes us on an acoustic romp which seems to preview his music in the 90's (\\"Soul Drifter\\") along with the bouncy closer, \\"You And I\\" which sounds almost like a holiday carol revealing second thoughts about Lindsey's 'break' from the band.<br />Mrs. McVie returns as proficient as songstress as ever, with four memorable songs added to her reserve. \\"Everywhere\\" is a love song made into a single by the fans, and \\"Mystified\\" keeps the listener entranced. The orchestral-sounding \\"Little Lies\\", which was the album's highest-charting single, is arguably Christine's best ballad since \\"Say You Love Me\\", while \\"Isn't It Midnight\\" is the album's hardest-rocking song, though in true Mac style.<br />Perhaps at the time, with the band's lineup change imminent, these five meant for this to be a souvenir for their longtime fans, though none could foresee what was to come for them, including their 1997 reunion. Even so, the album could possibly be considered their \\"Rumours\\" for the 80's. Fleetwood Mac proved after so long that they could still create a fantastic album, and \\"Tango\\" is one that must be heard.their longtime fans, though none could foresee what was to come for them, including their 1997 reunion.

B00005ATQM|2.0|Excellent cd and won't waste anyone's time reviewing the music. If you are looking at hard rock or heavy metal, you already know something about Metallica.<br />Just wanted to review the DVD Audio aspect of the cd/dvd. To keep it simple, while it sounded better, definitely had more of a feel for each individual instrument, it in no way is a major step up from a typical cd. <br />I quickly tossed my old tapes out the window and bought as many cd's as I could afford when they initially came out. But, after hearing this DVD-Audio representation of Metallica, the chances that I will restock my collection of cd's with DVD-Audio are slim. Oh well...at least I won't go broke! <br />Haven't heard the SACD format yet so maybe there is some promise there.

0060254920|5.0|Not much can be added to the accolades of so many people concerning the books and art of Maurice Sendak. I grew up with his work, I read his books to my children, I am reading them now to my grandchildren. ... And so will send for a hardback edition this time around. When children ask to read a book over and over again, you know that that book has found a place in their imaginations. This is one such book. When I think of a classic picture book, there are two such Maurice Sendak books that come to mind. His work is beyond mere illustration, it is an artform. The pictures require close attention to catch all the visual nuances. <br />Max is a typical little boy, who dons his wolf outfit and becomes a 'wolf' in his active imagination. In sending him to bed without dinner, he uses his imagination to turn his room into a wild forest inhabited by humongous monsters. He asserts his powers over the monsters, and becomes their rightful king, for he is surely a monster himself! Yet, his mother loves him in spite of his monsterism...and eventually he comes home to find that mother has relented and brought in his dinner...<br />This winter, get this book, this classic and sit down in a big chair with a child and read and pore over this book together. Every time a child is read to, it expands their imaginations, helps to determine their life course, aids in getting them ready for school and the 'real world'. Our children are not getting the aural and visual stimulation that is our right as chldren. My parents read to me, and I've never stopped reading because of that...in spite of captioned television and computer access. Our children have a right to be read to by someone they love and someone who loves them. Turn the television and computers off, and use a rainy evening to spend time with your own monsters. Maybe someday they will become the next Maurice Sendak!<br />Karen Sadler,<BR>Science Education,<BR>University of Pittsburgh

I love this movie so much, I won't let my little monster take it home!<br />I am absolutely awestruck at the abilities of the people who create these new films for families. The art work is incredible, and the storyline is so great, I wish I had thought of it. This story takes Maurice Sendak's books about monsters to the next level. Tully and company are a scream, the voices chosen perfect. I can actually see a little of Billy Crystal in the one-eyed monster...and if that isn't hard to do in acting, I don't know what is. I am hoping that the folks at Pixar can do another movie with these two, and come up with another remarkable and clever plot line along the line of how children actually think.<br />The thought that the monsters are more scared of the children in reality is a scream, and when they learn that what they've been told is not necessarily true, well...this is a lesson we need to be reminded about. We all label each other, because of our differences...and children and adults alike need to be reminded occasionally that different can be good, and to judge people on the basis of their own individuality. <br />I was afraid my granddaughter would be scared with this one, like she was with The Grinch. Never happened. This DVD is a definite collectors item, and a wonderful addition to our library.<br />Karen Sadler

B00005JKDR|5.0|This has to be one of the few Disney dvds that I can watch repeatedly without tiring of it...which is a good thing because my children watch it over and over and over again and somehow are still mezmerized. I just hope the dvd player holds up.<br />The picture is stunning and crystal clear, the sound is dynamic and sounds great in Dolby Surround, and the story surpasses the Toy Story movies. And on the second disk, one you get through the chatty producers talk, you can watch a funny new computer-animated chuckle-filled short entitled &quot;Mike's New Car&quot;. <br />And nobody dies in the movie, which puts it leagues ahead of Disney's true scarefest, Bambi.

0345409671|3.0|With Memnoch the Devil, the fifth installment in her \\"Vampire Chronicles\\", Anne Rice demonstrates what I have long suspected: that she is at heart a theologian and a wonderfully heretical one too. Rice is as learned and daring as her most famous creation, the Vampire Lestat. She also has the common touch necessary to reach a wide audience. The pious and the snobbish alike are appropriately forewarned.<br />Readers familiar with the series will need no introduction to Lestat, who finds himself this time around sought after by no less a personage than the Devil. Those who are dipping into Rice for the first time may find themselves confused about who's who among the many characters. Not to mention why on earth God and the Devil would seek the aid of the amoral and murderous aesthete who is the Vampire Lestat.<br />As a novel, Memnoch is not Rice's finest. I miss the luxuriously detailed story-telling and fine-tuned characterizations of the early vampire novels. All of that is dispensed with here as Rice barely goes through the motions of introducing characters and setting the scene. <br />As an exploration of ideas, on the other hand - ideas about the nature of God and man, good and evil, beauty and truth - Memnoch is Rice's most ambitious, interesting and meaningful work. The story within the story - the story of the creation and evolution of the cosmos and man as told to Lestat by Memnoch the Devil is the true heart of the novel. In fact, the Vampire Chronicles could be viewed as Rice's vehicle for promoting an authentically postmodern theology (with roots in ancient Gnosticism?)...<br />Some critics complain that Memnoch is \\"too philosophical\\". But there is a philosophical element in all Rice's works and that is what has always made her more interesting to me than any other \\"pulp fiction\\" writer. Surely this also accounts for the widespread appeal of her writing. She writes great stories about vampires and witches it's true, but that's not all there is to her books. Her true concern has always been the human condition. Life, death, eating, killing, surviving... Loving...<br />Conclusion: Memnoch is a must for Rice fans. Those who have yet to be initiated into her world are advised to start at the beginning with Interview With the Vampire.

B00006F83Y|4.0|It's a very good album, but not a great album. I read an interview of the band and their focus was to incorporate those catchy pop hooks that many of us are afraid to admit we like, without making it too mainstream. They definitely accomplished this; you'll be humming some of these tunes for days. Their music can be more precisely described as modern rock, since the stoner elements are reduced. Yet their sound remains heavy enough and most of the songs in the album are good. It's not their best album so far, but it will satisfy the fanbase and the quality remains good enough to outrank most bands around nowadays. The album starts off great: the first track is mostly like the old days, and the second track is the well-known radio tune. But my favorite is the third track, \\"First it Giveth\\". Excellent song. There are other notables scattered throughout, but overall the album wears a tad thin toward the end. You get a lot of bang for the buck though: 51 minutes of pure rock. Thumbs up.

B000068IEU|5.0|No spoilers in this review :)<br />This film is still banned in Australia, so ordering from Amazon is a must to import it. While the DVD has the pan&scan transfer making it double-sided which it didn't need, and doesn't include a chapter-list insert the movie itself is presented very well.<br />This movie is about the horrors of real life, and about the people who create these horrors. The scenes in this movie are utterly compelling and chillingly real. The picture has some grain, however much better quality then previous releases and adds to the film's atmosphere (gives it a real life feel like the stilted effect used in war movies).<br />The film which most closely resembles this one is Saving Private Ryan and has several similarities - it is about the real-life horrors of war and like Last House On The Left doesn't show the characters or the audience any mercy. The footage is very real and you can feel the character's pain.<br />If you can sit through one you can sit through the other, so in closing I'd just like to say that this is defiantly the second-best horror film I've seen (The Exorcist is the best horror film). So I recommend The Exorcist and Saving Private Ryan if you like this film, I recommend this film if you like Saving Private Ryan or The Exorcist.

It's a little bizarre (not a bad thing), but I wouldn't recommend it if you're a first time CP reader.  I'd say read &quot;Fight Club&quot; first.  Book sheds interesting light on maternity and humility.
B000002572|5.0|Think of all the hard-driving rock bands of the Seventies.  Blue Oyster Cult.  Bachman Turner Overdrive.  The Doobie Brothers.  Foghat.  Peter Frampton.  Uriah Heep.  Ledd Zeppelin.<br />None of them had the impact on the rock culture like Boston...like Boston's triumphant debut album, appropriately entitled BOSTON.  As a student at the University of Oklahoma in the fall of 1976, I can still recall this album blaring in every dorm room, the single \\"More Than A Feeling\\" being played on all the Top 40 stations, and weak (and I mean very weak) imitations of Boston songs being performed by every garage band in the area.  Clean, crisp, innovative, and inspired, Boston had a dynamic sound all its own--a sound super groups like Journey and Foreigner tried to emulate in the Eighties.<br />BOSTON is in a class by itself simply because EVERY CUT garnered radio air time.  Every cut.  There is not a clinker on the album.  And the album continues to attract new audiences--legions of fans born long after 1976.  It's one of the few albums from the Seventies that my kids (all young adults) enthusiastically enjoy, and better yet, it's one of the few rock albums period that this reviewer still \\"head bangs\\" to (a sickening sight, admittedly).  BOSTON was, and is, the definitive rock album.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I'm not going to say that people who gave this film one star are stupid and have no idea what art is because if some of them are like that, then it would seem to be the fault of American newspapers.  What I mean is that most people had been led to believe that this was thriller.  It's not.  Obviously a trailer or review which tells it how it is wouldn't sell enough theatre tickets.  <br />The slim thriller aspect of the film is secondary to the reasons behind the murder and social climate which could cause it.  I saw Gosford Park on a rainy, hungover, Sunday afternoon in the centre of Glasgow.  As my headache subsided and I actually got into the film I grew to love some characters and loathe others.  I felt I was sitting somewhere between the servants and the elite, other than this I honestly didn't notice the direction (which some would say is a directors job).  As the film ended I hoped they might have lined up the projectors incorrectly and there would be another two hours.<br />On the subject of sound I can't really say anything as I'm an englishman who has lived in Scotland for 13yrs and I have some fairly posh (and pretentious) friends.  To me the soundscaping was excellent and the overlapping added to my enjoyment of the film.
B000024ZYP|5.0|Thimar touches the soul and the mind as well. Not a single redundant node is played, but those that are there all have meaning. The whole music is airy (with a lot of reverb thanks to ECM :-) and lacks Rabih Abou-Khalil's agressivity but not his energy. John Surman and Dave Holland are both great.<br />I think I can't say anything about the beauties of this work... You have to listen.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie! It is so sweet and anybody from 3 to 103 will enjoy it too. This is definately one of Disney's better recent movies. Recently, I think Disney has been slacking off, but they apparently didn't with this movie! Pixar also did an awsome job with the animation. Another thing. I completely and totally reccommend the DVD. It has sooo much extra stuff, it's not even funny! And of course For the Birds is a seperate movie in itself . . . .  : )
B000066NW0|5.0|So, having dodged and weaved around falling in love with shoot-to-superstar types such as Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, I finally fell into the trap (along with millions of others) when Avril Lavigne came out with her amazing album. Her relatively simple songs are driven by awesome backing effect and the most incredible siren-song voice heard in a long time. <br />A few complaints, though: the lyrics, whilst always very honest (good) are simplistic, cliche and unoriginal in places (bad). Also, Avril dominates the scene too much - the boys in the band (if they really are a band) should come into the scene more. Otherwise you just end up falling into the same trap that No Doubt did. But hey, for a debut album this good, we'll definitely forgive those faults. My recommendation: buy the album, enjoy it, and hope the next one is even better!
0316666343|5.0|I hardly cry. At 'sob' movies such as 'Titanic' I didn't cry. I am a tough guy. However, after reading Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones: A Novel, I found myself crying. Crying at the unfairness that Susie Salmon ( as in fish ) faces. Watching how her family copes with her death. It got to the point that it became difficult to read through the tears, and I'm not exaggerating.<br />The book begins innocently enough, as we read of her Susie got her place in heaven and how heaven is like. We watch how her family deals with her ordeal, and as with Susie, we watch her family and friends grow, we too watch her grow. As it starts out somehow grim, optimism soon paves new roads in the book, leaving you laughing and sobbing all at the same time. It was magical.<br />After reading the book, I found myself somehow at a lost. It is a good thing. I had all these funny emotions of joy, sadness and anger running through me. It made me want to read the book again.

B00003CWTI|5.0|Brilliant. Brilliant. The performances here are blistering and unforgettable - Cruise, Robards, Moore, and Macy absolutely sensational. Everything is connected in the film, the songs, the television, the people. The past never fades, but grows stronger and stronger. Anderson shows the importance of family love, and what havoc, what hell, a bunch of [bad] Dads can inflict on their children. I know there are those who dissent, but I believe this is one of the most important movies of the decade. The \\"ecological\\" conclusion is so beyond description and so fitting. Although it's too long, it's truly worth watching over and over again. Aimee Mann's song are also magnificent.
0792165020|4.0|I've spent some time reading the other reviews on this site and I'm a little upset that the first few reviews I read were all negative, so I'd like to add a positive one.  Unforuntately, most people that I've talked to didn't like the movie for various reasons.  I, on the other hand, thought it was fabulous.  The plot was inventive and the twist for an ending left me speechless in the theater.  Yes, the plot has holes - but show me Hollywood movie was a flawless plot.  I found the main cast fabulous, including even the terrible Freddie Miles who I probably would've strangled with my own hand.  Please go see the movie.  I never found it boring, but quite the opposite.  Give it a chance!
B00005JL0I|3.0|With its tongue firmly planted in cheek, Casino Royale takes viewers on a wild ride through the spy business. David Niven plays the retired James Bond (who despises what his successor with the same name has been doing on behalf of the UK). The plot is little more than an excuse to cobble together 5 different segements (with 5 different directors including John Huston who appears in a cameo).<br />The funnest segment involves Peter Sellers as James Bond. He projects confidence so well in his witty performance that you'd almost expect him to play the role in a Real Bond Film. His scenes with Orson Welles very from mildly entertaining to rip roaring funny. Welles was reportedly irritated with Sellers during the making of the film so most of his material was shot with Seller's around (Seller's made fun of Welles girth and continually bated him during the production).<br />Although it hasn't aged as gracefully as some the Flint films (which still work very well as satire), Casion Royale still works well enough to enjoy. In many respects, it's a predecessor to the Austin Powers movies and plays like that film crossed with It's A Mad, Mad, Mad World.<br />Although Casino Royale is a lot of lightweight fun, it's not as good a spoof as its producers seem to think. James Coburn was actually funnier in the two Our Man Flint spy spoofs. Casino Royale is a notch below Flint and above the Dean Martin Matt Helm films.<br />A pity there was no way include a cameo of Sean Connery (the film's producers were not the producers of the Bond series. Casino Royale was the only Fleming book that they owned. That's one of the reasons they elected to go in a satirical direction with the film as anything else would have resulted in lawsuits). It's also a pity that the various directors are no longer around  to include a commentary track. Most of the principles are dead so it's no surprise that there's no commentary track from them as well.<br />Casino Royale is an enjoyable romp as long as you check your expectations at the door. While time hasn't been as kind to it as it has been to some of the Bond & Flint films, it was clearly ahead of its time.you check your expectations at the door.

0783229526|5.0|\\"We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.\\"<br />When you hear those words at the very beginning of the movie, you know you're in for a wild life.  So my advice is that you buy the ticket and take the ride!  You're just about ready then, aren't you?<br />Get in!<br />In this wickedly funny and entertaining dark film, \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\\" Terry Gilliam captures the humor and chaos in Hunter S. Thompson's literary masterpiece.  Not an easy task if you ask me.  If this film were done wrong, it would've been a terrible tragedy.  Fortunately, it was done right.<br />Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro star as Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo.  When a writing assignment is given to Duke, the two go to Vegas for the ultimate trip.  (Trust me, \\"trip\\" is the appropriate word.)  With a trunk full of every single kind of drug you can imagine, the two are off to Vegas.  But soon everything spins out of control and the writing assignment is no longer the only things on their minds.<br />Johnny Depp is hilarious as Raoul Duke.  Why he didn't win an Academy Award for his performance is beyond me.  He even lived with Hunter for a couple of months to get his character down right.  Now, that is some serious research.  And Del Toro is awesome as the Samoan attorney Dr. Gonzo.  (You wouldn't even recognize him if it weren't for his voice.)<br />Terry Gilliam did an outstanding job at directing this risk-taking film.  We actually feel like we're on drugs while watching.  Forget D.A.R.E.!  Have the kids watch this movie and they'll never want to do drugs!  Gilliam does a remarkable job of capturing Thompson's genius and placing it onto film.  The images we are given are dark and surreal, and are out of this world.<br />The DVD is not too bad as well.  There's a few extras that you'll find very entertaining.  Not a lot, but there are a few.  Including a behind the scenes feature, the theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and more.  (Watch the trailer, it's one of the funniest ones I have ever seen.  It'll give you an idea of what you're in for.)  The picture and sound quality are very high quality, although I wish the movie were presented to us in Dolby Digital 5.1 instead of 2.0.  Oh well.<br />I read the book after the seeing the movie, and it actually helped.  Just picturing Depp and Del Toro enriched the story that much more.  Depp with the cigarette always in his mouth as he narrates always stands out in your mind, and that's why it was that much funnier.  Yes, I thought the book was a little better than the film, but let me say this, the film did a remarkable job of staying true to the book.  The two are very similar.<br />Here's two things I would like to make clear:  1)  No, you do not have to be a stoner to enjoy this movie.  I have never done drugs, and seeing this movie makes me NEVER want to do drugs.  Ever.  But guess what?  I still enjoyed the film and found it funny as hell.  2)  The reason why there's not much of a plot is because this is all based on a TRUE STORY.  Real life doesn't have plot, I'm sorry to say.  Life can't always have a distinct and notable climax or resolution, now can it?<br />All in all, I really enjoyed this film, and thought it was very misunderstood by a lot of people.  Yes, this is one of those films you're either going to love it or hate it.  There are no guarantees that you will like it, but then again, isn't that always the case?  I say take the ride.  Take the chance.  Dare to be different.  If you want something that doesn't fall into the category of \\"ordinary,\\" then this is the film for you.  Extremely hilarious and terribly freaky at times, \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" is a different kind of film experience you do not want to miss.<br />I also recommend reading the book as well.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|You got me at the first song. Along with Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast stands as the pinnacle of Disney animation in the later part of the 20th century. Certainly Disney has produced many great and cherished films, but Beauty And The Beast managed to jump the animation ghetto and win respect from audiences and critics alike. Is it the best? It doesn't really matter what matters is that B&amp;B can hold its own (and then some) with other Disney and other animation masterpieces.<br />The songs are rich, vibrant and as alive as the characters. In fact, they come alive in song much as the characters did during the golden age of the Hollywood musical. The animation is flawless and the story well constructed and without the artiface of other Disney films. As much as I like The Lion King (and I do like it alot!), B&amp;B isn't as calculated as that film nor as topical as Aladdin (which is both a strong and weak point for that classic film--one of my Disney favs). I was never much of a fan of early Disney (although I recognize the value of those films) as I was raised on Warner Brother cartoons. Beauty And The Beast manages to meld the slapstick style of the Warner cartoons (much like Aladdin) with the storytelling wizardry of Disney.<br />The casting is perfect. I'm not much of a Robby Benson fan (I've always found him to be an annoying performer in films--too aware of himself and his &quot;talent&quot; to ever be lost in a role). In B&amp;B Benson shines managing to lose himself in the role of the dark and brooding Beast. The female lead is just as captivating and powerful (I can't recall her name).<br />The DVD comes packed with extras some essential and some dispensable. The three different versions of B&amp;B included aren't essential expect for collectors but it is fun to compare and contrast them. The added song and sequence isn't essential to the action (it's really more of a marketing ploy although it does add a freshness for those who've seen the film upteen times). Ashman's lyrics and Menken's music are witty and literate as well as fun to sing so this &quot;new&quot; song is a welcome addition.<br />A powerful mixture of pathos, drama, comedy and song Beauty And The Beast marked a new highwater mark for the Mouse Factory.

B00006AG5N|5.0|It is great to finally have a full cd length collection of Elvis tunes spanning his entire recording career. The new remixes are wonderful and really bring out a lot of sonic clarity in the instrumentation not previously heard on earlier mixes. It is funny to see that even Elvis got the Pro Tools remixing treatment on a few songs. However, I didn't like the alternate version of \\"The Wonder of You.\\" The well known version, which was a single, came from the On Stage, February 1970 album, which was reissued and remixed in 1997. This is from a different concert, but the arrangement is just the same. \\"Suspicious Minds\\" must have been hard to remix. Apparently there was a lot of dropout on the tape (horns and organs disappearing in spots), and the digital remix makes the song sound really bad on the high frequencies. (Cymbals and background vocals sound overprocessed at times by the attempt to fix the dropouts)  All in all, the producers of this album did a fine job in enhancing the overall quality of the other tracks. For [a fair price] you really get your money's worth, so check it out!
B00000K31Q|5.0|One of my guilty pleasures are watching teen movies.  I am a 32 year old guy who likes this cheese ball stuff for some reason.  This by far the best modern era teen movie.  This is good enough to stack up against the 80's teen flicks that were so outstanding.  In this update of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.  There are a pair of sisters, the younger one is not allowed to date until the older one does.  The older sister is consumed with being different and being a loner , we find out that there is a reason for this attitude.  In addition so many guys want to date the younger sister that they pay a new kid at the school to try and date the older sister.  Well just like all good teen movies romance blooms for everyone and everyone is happy.  If your looking for a really great feel good movie this may be for you.
0385483821|4.0|Only the Paranoid Survive will never be compared with Churchill's memoirs in terms of literary mastery, but Andrew Grove's book does succeed where many other business tell-alls fail: It illustrates the lessons that you can learn from the challenges that its protagonist has overcome. In other words, this book teaches you something. By focusing on the make-or-break turning points that determined Intel's fate, Grove shows how to manage crises in order to seize the opportunities that they so often provide. For this simple lesson, we from getAbstract recommend this book to all business readers.
B00005JKDR|5.0|... because I have a toddler who *loves* Pixar movies.  Before this one, it was Toy Story I and II.  They still get plenty of watching, but Monsters, Inc. has taken center stage for the moment.  The best thing I can say about this movie, besides echoing the positive reviews of other posters, is that I haven't gotten sick of it even through all the watchings.  Every time, I notice something new and subtle, and always funny.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I own albums from artists as varied and different as Aphex Twin, Mozart, and Pink Floyd. Amongst all of them, this is, without a doubt, one of the top ten albums I've ever heard. Actually, it would be more accurate to place it in the top five. As trendy as it may have become to place Radiohead's music in a genre of its own, one which only a select few will be able to truly understand, it has become even more trendy to simply bash it on the grounds that it was a success. To understand the value of a selection of music, one must put context aside and listen to it for what it is.<br />Popular or not, OK Computer demonstrates undeniably extraordinary talent in guitar playing (especially in Paranoid Android and Electioneering), drums (especially in Airbag and Climbing Up the Walls), and vocals (every song on the album with the exception of Fitter Happier, which contains none). Few albums contain the variety, intensity, and emotion found in OK Computer, and no other artist can convey such things in quite the way that Radiohead does.<br />Not everyone will love OK Computer, as is true with any piece of music. Some may simply not like the type of music it presents us with, which is perfectly acceptable. One must, however, admit the amount of talent and diversity shown in the album, qualities which, by themselves, warrant 3/5 stars and no less under any circumstance, in my opinion, which leads me to be disgusted by those who shamelessly give it a 1/5 stars, and would give it a lower rating if such a thing were possible.<br />In any case, despite whatever your musical background may be, this album is definitely worth a try.
0060931671|5.0|For everyone out there who quakes at the thought of starting Gravity's Rainbow, this book is the best jumping off point to enter the Pynchon universe.<br />But more than that, this book is a marvelous tale, compactly told.  In it you can see the germs of much of what would become dominant themes in Pynchon's later works (such as an interest in the channels through which information pass and the people who run them).  Yes, this isn't his first novel, and it's by far not his most well known -- but in my opinion, it provides the most satisfying read, without the feeling of being overwhelmed by the immensity of Gravity's Rainbow or some of the missteps that seemed to plague V. and Vineland.<br />Find yourself a rainy Sunday, curl up in your favorite chair, and read this.  It's an overlooked treasure.
B000002H6C|5.0|in 1994, i bought metallica's \\"the black album\\", and it totally turned me on to the trash metal band.  after buying the rest of the albums over the next year i came to the conclusion that \\"...and justice for all\\"\\" was sonically,and lyrically, better than any of the other albums.  a very intense cd beginning with the destruction of mother earth in \\"blackend\\" to the 9 minute ride through the government and politics in the title track, to the mellow wartime medely of \\"one\\", all the way to the finishing song that represents all that is speed metal, \\"dyers eve\\", it is simply the total package and will stand the test of time forever.
B00004XQ83|5.0|In addition to being a great soundtrack from a great movie, this album is able to stand on its own as a superb sampler of American \\"roots\\" music -- a fascinating cross section of folk, blues, and bluegrass music, plus some tunes that almost defy categorization.<br />Like many other reviewers here I decided to buy this soundtrack on the strength of its standout hit, \\"Man of Constant Sorrow.\\"  I can listen to the two major version of that over and over.  Since buying the disc I've found several additional songs that I go back to again and again.  For example, I love the starkness of a single man singing with no musical accompaniment on \\"Oh Death\\", the otherworldly soulfulness of \\"Didn't Leave Nobody but the Baby\\", and the humorous verse of \\"Big Rock Candy Mountains.\\"<br />Buy a few copies of this album -- keep one for yourself and give the others away as gifts.  I'm sure your father will appreciate it more than another pair of dress socks or a loud tie.
0671027344|5.0|Out of all the books I've read in the past, this has been the best book I've read.  The main character and narrator Charlie, is a wallflower who is shy, fairly smart, and a loving and respectable person.  He writes letters to a friend who remains unknown.  He starts off his freshman year facing the death of his best friend and the memories with his favorite Aunt Helen.  He gets through the year with the help of his teacher Bill, friends, and family.  Charlie being shy gets more \\"involved\\".  He encounters experiences with new people, first crushes and relationships, intimate moments, friendship, drugs and the bonding between his family members.  Charlie writes, \\"Maybe it's good to put things in perspective, but sometimes, I think that the only perspective is to really be there.  Like Sam said.  Because it's okay to feel things.  And be who you are about them.\\"  With everything Charlie encounters with his adventurous freshman year, he not only learns more about life, but also finds his true self.  <BR>    <BR>I would recommend this book because it can relate to teenagers and what they're going through.  The book also relates to topics America's youth talk about such as relationships, family, friends, school, and the entire drama one individual can encounter.  Older readers can enjoy this book too because they can look back through the years and reflect, relate and reminisce about their times being in high school.  Charlie says, \\"And I just thought how great it is to have friends and a family.  And how much I wanted my sister and brother and Sam and Patrick and everyone else to be happy.  And that was enough to make me feel infinite.\\"  After reading this book, people will understand the true meaning of friendship and family.  Also, they will see how important it is to love each other and how valuable family and friends can be.  Readers will realize how precious life is and to live life to the fullest because maybe just one day you won't have a life.  Also, just like how Charlie felt, it is better to spend more time with people you love, or get to know people you don't really know because one day they just might not be there.
0525946284|5.0|It's World War II in occupied Paris, and the French Resistance has a mission. It is to destroy the Nazi occupied communications and railway systems to the point where they cannot be recovered before the invasion at Normandy. The Resistance members are not, for the most part, untouchable Arnold Schwarzneggers, they are people like you and me, women and men, scared out of their wits, facing relentless terror and unspeakable torture if caught. Ken Follett writes with his usual flair for making you stay up at night. Each page is a thriller of it's own, each death of a Resistance member a dent in your heart, each small Victory a smile on your face. A fabulous book filled with the true depth of human courage in the face of unbeatable odds.
B00006J3T4|5.0|I must admit, although I enjoyed Goldenheart and Sailing to Philadelphia, I was uncertain how far Mr Knopfler would take what seemed to be evolving into, dare I say, a more laid back approach to his music.<BR>I need not have worried! This is a phenomenal album; certainly the best of his three solo albums to date. The music styles are wide ranging from folk, Celtic, bluegrass, Appalachian, jazz and rock - (I could even imagine Michael Franks doing a cover version of the samba-tinged A Place where We used to Live)and allows Mr Knopfler ample opportunity to display his skills on both acoustic and electric guitars.<BR>Wonderful music from a man I consider to be one of the finest guitarists in the world today- a man who knows when to play and equally as important, when not to. Have a listen and let the man play and the music speak!
B00000ILDE|5.0|Bugs are icky.<br />Entomologists might disagree with me, but black, glistening, chitinous exoskeletons evoke a primal revulsion in many people. Wasps are the worst--they're cruel-looking, aggresive predators. H.R Giger tapped this nerve when he envisioned the creature for &quot;Alien,&quot; and James Cameron (with Stan Winston) pushed those buttons even harder when he tweaked the design for the sequel. Plus, Cameron's film shows more of the aliens in motion, and their agile leaping and lightning-quick striking movements are fundamentally unsettling.<br />Ripley, the sole survivor of the first film is returned to Earth, where she learns that people have begun settling the world she visited. When communications are mysteriously cut off, Ripley accompanies a band of Colonial Marines to investigate. After landing on the desolate planet, they discover the entire colony is missing, except for one small girl named Newt.  The marines inadvertently swagger into a hive of lurking parasites, where chaos quickly breaks loose. The marines' overconfident bravado proves to be their undoing--they DRASTICALLY underestimate their foe.<br />Ripley, Newt and the last few Marines are left to figure out an escape, while hordes of murderous aliens converge on their position...<br />The DVD release, touted as a &quot;director's cut,&quot; includes 17 unnecessary minutes. Most of the additions are insignificant, but a restored sequence fleshing out Ripley's backstory detracts from her relatonship with Newt--the fact that Ripley once had a daughter makes her bonding with Newt more contrived. I always thought it made for a more well-rounded character that Newt ignited a maternal instinct in the tough, ordeal-scarred Ripley.<br />Like most &quot;special editions,&quot; I wish they'd included the original theatrical cut on the disc. But even with the extraneous footage, this film is top-notch entertainment, and there are some neat bonus features that make the DVD worth picking up.<br />At itsheart, &quot;Aliens&quot; is an &quot;icky bugs&quot; movie. But it's a darn good one.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I THINK THIS MOVIE IS A FUN CHANGE FROM THE ANIMATED CARTOON. MY DAUGHTER WAS LAUGHING THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE. THEY COULDN'T OF PICKED ANY BETTER ACTORS, AND ACTRESSES TO PLAY THE GANGS PARTS. IT'S A MUST HAVE MOVIE TO OWN IN YOUR CHILD'S DVD COLLECTION.

0375823352|5.0|Like Rowling's Goblet of Fire, there were definitely parts of the book that could have been omitted that would have made the story move along faster...But Pullman's expert writing is not something that you want to be over soon...Pullman, more so in Amber Spyglass than either of the first two books (which are amazing), exhibits a mastery of the writing and storytelling crafts.....A reader cannot help but BE with Lyra and Will and physically FEEL the full range of emotions that these two children on the brink of young adulthood go through from beginning to end of Amber Spyglass.
B000002H6C|5.0|Excellent!! In my oppinion metallicas second best recording behind kill em all.. this is RAW metallica at its best.. and you gotta love the track ONE.. possibly the best heavy metal song of the 80z, from THE cockyest yet BEST metal act of the 80z.

Is it really necessary for him to be THAT negative? <br />Jeff, let's see YOU make a sci-fi movie, or any movie, for that matter. Roger Ebert has more positive reviews than you. You should evaluate, not blast. It's people like you that give critics everywhere a bad name.

B00006IUL7|3.0|In 1997 a Swedish filmmaker named Erik Skjoldbjaerg released a film he titled \\"Insomnia\\". It was about a detective from Sweden who was sent to solve a brutal murder in northern Norway, where the sun shines 24 hours a day... does this sound familiar? I gave this movie three stars simply because of the incredible lack of originality. It is obviously a complete ... of Skjoldbjaerg's film. If you have seen the Swedish film you would agree with me that this movie is far below the standards as a film than the original. Please, if you have already seen this movie, don't buy it. Take the time to purchase Skjoldbjaerg's Insomnia, it is a much better film (if you can live with subtitles).
B00003CXFG|5.0|I was told that Vin Diesal would be the next big action film star, but I was unfamiliar with him until this film and I must say based on this, he will be around and making some excellent films.<br />This is basically a redo of Aliens, but boy what a good one!!  A spacecraft travelling along, is hit by space debris and causes the ship to crash land.  The Captain is killed leaving their female pilot, a bounty hunter and his prisoner and various other travellers on a planet with three suns.  The immediate danger is the need for water, so they strike out in search, but come upon an abandoned colony.  But no colonists.  They soon discover that 22 years ago, the people were attacked by creatures of the night, sort of a cross between a dragon and a bat that feed on human flesh.  The pilot contends with the struggle between the drug addict bounty hunter and his killer prisoner (Vin) and they all fight to survive first the desert planet, then the coming of the 22 year solar eclipse that sets the monsters of the dark loose.<br />It is taught, edge of the seat action, with great writing, direction and super acting from the whole cast.<br />One very great Sci-FI film!!
B00001PE4D|1.0|No. This movie is not sexy, not cool and definitely a [piece of poo]. \\"Cruel Intentions\\" tries everything but misses the bull's eye. Ryan Phillippe doing his best Justin Timberlake, makes a bet with his stepsister (Sarah Michelle Gellar) that he will win over the virgin of the country (Reese Witherspoon). Gellar's performance was nothing admirable compared to a high school cheerleader's dance routine. What happened at the end? I don't care. After watching the \\"Mighty Ducks\\" boy wrestling with another guy in bed, I had to turn it off. Thumbs down kids.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I was watching Janet Jackson's ICON special - was that MTV... I think so - and one of the performances was Pink recreating some of Janet's dance moves... and she was pretty good - good enough for me to remember her (OK, the name helped).  I'd never heard of her before.  Then, recently I heard &quot;Get The Party Started&quot; and thought it was a GREAT party song, but assumed that was the extent of this Pink's range.  Next I saw the video for &quot;Just Like a Pill&quot; and really listened to the lyrics and watched the performance and it dawned on me that there was more to Pink than a groovy dance song.  I bought the CD.<br /><br />She has a LOT going for her.  First - great lyrics.  Lyrics which bare her soul in a way that many self proclaimed &quot;artist's&quot; would never dare.  Lyrics with a positive and empowering message without being preachy or losing their edginess.  They may empower but they have a bite!<br />Second - A great voice well worth the listen.<br />Third - While the bulk of this album is dance driven, it's clear that the girl has range.  She would be every bit as comfortable singing a Marlene Dietrich torch song or Janis Joplin  or Joan Jett or any other style you care to name.<br /><br />If you're looking for some great Dance/Party/Pop music that isn't Bubble gum Pop, that isn't dumbed down... check this album out.  I have a feeling there's a lot more coming from Pink.
B000056PWV|5.0|'Rear Window' has long been revered not only as a classic Hitchcock film but a classic in its own right, so I was keen to watch it.  When I did so I was more than pleasantly surprised that something that is now quite old could be enjoyable as well as intelligent and just as relevant today (maybe even more so) than it was in its time.  The story by now is famous, with James Stewart playing Jeffries, a photographer who is wheelchair-bound in his appartment and begins spying on his neighbours to pass time.  Interesting as his neighbours may be, one man in particular catches his eye when his wife mysteriously disappears and Jeffries convinces himself that she has been murdered by her husband.<br />Whilst on the surface this may appear to be a routine, but masterfully crafted thriller, it is actually a lot more than that, questioning the voyeurism inherent in everyone, our wish to see something new, exciting and shocking.  The camerawork creates an incredibly tense atmosphere, with everything shown from Jeffries' perspective from the window of his appartment.  As the camera pans slowly over the other flats we see tiny images of people boxed up in their windows, their private lives on display and us staring in at them; whether it be a couple arguing, a lonely woman or a sexy ballet dancer it's made very clear that it isn't just the character who's the voyeur but the audience as well.<br />The movie also questions how we view our lives as reflections of other people's, such as when Jeffries reluctantly talks of committment to his girlfriend (Kelly) whilst looking on at a husband and wife shouting at one another.  All this and it's acted to perfection by Stewart, Kelly and a highly accomplished supporting cast.  There's even a spot of dark humour here, especially in the character of the nurse who views it all with a ghoulish yet comic intensity.  In 'Rear Window' Hitchcock had created that rarity - a Hollywood film that was not only popular at the time, but that continues to be so today, a movie that is enjoyable merely on the basis of the story yet is intelligent and insightful as well.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Who should buy this?<br />1. Fans &amp; Followers of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br />2. Those interested in Musical Theatre and Original Cast albums.<br />3. Anyone drawn to interesting and creative writing.<br /><br />If you saw the episode then you already know how truly well done it was.  If you didn't see the episode, there isn't room to explain it to you, but trust me - it was brilliant and very much NON-contrived.  Each song serves a very real purpose to forward the plot AND offers insight into the character.  It's not the most complex MUSIC - but the lyrics are intelligent and often very clever (but not &quot;clever&quot; in that annoyingly self indulgent &quot;Look how witty I can be&quot; way)<br /><br />This album should also be held up as a shining example for Cast Recordings.  It is COMPLETE... including all those wonderful little side moments of townspeople singing in the background!  It also includes demo versions with the composer/lyricist performing - those imperfect gems that collectors of musical theatre music clamor for.<br /><br />It also includes incidental music from a few CLASSIC episodes... most notably &quot;HUSH.&quot; - the silent episode.  On one album... the Musical episode and the silent one.  I LOVE IT!<br /><br />There is a downside though.  Watching the episode I was caught up in the action and therefore very forgiving but listening, focussing solely on the music - the flaws in the vocal performances become much MUCH more pronounced and it's clear that a few cast members are ill-suited for musical performance.  They are, unfortunately, very weak - and it frequently detracts from what is an otherwise spectacular recording.
B00000IPAX|4.0|Enema of the State marks the last album they are a real punk sounding band.  I think this is a great cd, I don't care what you people think that just call em a bunch of backstreet girls, this is good.  TOYPAJ then marks the end of blink 182 greatness.
B000001FN3|4.0|I should admit I am not a big fan of The Alan Parsons Project but I always had a fondness for this debut album of theirs. Without a doubt, this is a more succesful foray into classical (hey, it ain't a dirty word) music than either Deep Purple or Pink Floyd were able to muster. At it's best TOMAI is very evocative and beautiful. At it's worst? Foghat.<br />Remastered version pluses:<br />Orson Wells narration-This is a better way to remember the last days of this great orator and film innovator<br />Cuts-I had the LP version of this which didn't allow me to listen to individual parts of &quot;Fall of the House of Usher&quot;. The CD indexes all five parts.<br />Booklet-The booklet design combines all the original LP packaging with new photos which further the eery mood of the album's subject.<br />Minuses<br />Remastering and Re-recording - Parts were added to this version which was re-mixed in 1987. The greater whole of the album is unmolested but the &quot;ambient&quot; (as Parsons states in the liner notes)remix of the drums has that high treble &quot;splat&quot; of eighties studio sound. The mix seems a bit more condensed (80's)overall compared to the LP. Also &quot;Usher&quot; needed no overdubs or re-dos - however small.<br />A proper issue of the original (which fans no longer have the option of buying) is due but in the meantime this one will have to suffice.
B00006F7S4|1.0|Loved Beck for ages. His quirky stuff will always hold a special place in my heart, but this is total .... He doesn't have the pipes for slow stuff, and the music behind it isn't clever enough to carry any of the sounds. It's total crap, start to finish. One listen and I was ready to pitch myself off of a bridge. It makes Radiohead sound more fun than Nsync. If Beck is really that far in the .. emotionally, I'd like to have some of his problems, starting with his paycheck.
630518299X|1.0|It was depressing. For a guy to be so naive all his life and to suddenly find out about it at 30 (not exactly that young no more) didn't make sense.<br />It was really just about a world wide audience watching an everyday guy's boring life. No real action, no honestly from his best friend, ever, and it doesn't even show him interacting with he REAL world for the first time in his life.<br />It didn't really show the girl he really liked and him being together that long. For how much of the movie showed his life as a rat in a giant cage, they could've showed him being outside in the real world for the first time in his life to compensate.<br />It was like 'Enemy of the State', but only with all his clothes and everywhere he went. Also, the movie was a little too serious because Jim Carrey wasn't really putting on any comedy performances.<br />It was just depressing for a guy to know that after 30 years of his life wasted that he finally realizes that he's been played for a fool all that time. If it were another actor that's younger and to find out about his unfortunate life after only 20 years, then he'd still have his whole life ahead of him.<br />This movie to me was boring, depressing, and I just felt like there wasn't a long enough, detailed happy ending.
B0000542D2|1.0|A lot of things were said about the release of this DVD. Unfortunatelly the people that were involved in it didn't care about it.Instead of giving us new things they cut out good stuff, such as the &quot;I'll cry instead&quot; intro, the trailers, and the stereo sound....the sound is very dissapointing, and the interviews, especially in disc 2 are quite boring, and don't bring anything new or exciting to what we know about the beatles.I will hold on to my old DVD version of this movie, which has a stereo sound and really more interesting things than this &quot;new&quot; version
1577311523|5.0|You've heard the old maxim that there is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come. That's what The Power of Now represents to me. I have been in the book business all my adult life and consider myself somewhat jaded when it comes to books on self-help, gurus or enlightenment manuals. In fact, I almost never read them. There is something unique about The Power of Now that makes it stand out in an otherwise crowded field. It may be the clarity of the language, the absence of technical language, or more likely, the fact the author is clearly writing about a place the he authentically inhabits; and that my friends, is rare indeed. When describing this book to others, I compare the concepts and practices to the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh, and to the Dzogchen teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as the core instructions of such Zen Masters as Dogen and Hongzhi. The thing that makes this book so magical is that you get all that pith instruction without having to wade through cultural artiface or the barriers of religiosity. This is only the second review I've written, and I'm doing it because I believe this book is fundamentally important. The teachings have had an immediate impact on my life in a way that few books ever have. I agree with the editorial review - within a chapter of reading this book, I was already holding the world in a different container. This is the real deal.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|This is without a doubt the best film in the world maybe because it has vin desial in it but the aliens were even cooler than the aliens in aliens 3.I am the biggest vin disel fan ...And i have watched pitch black 5 times and i am planning on watching it again!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I agree with another reviewer that this CD deserves an average rating of 5 stars and not 4.5.  This album is a masterpiece and will go down in history as one of the greats of the 90's.  What's interesting about Radiohead is that they weren't as commercialy succesful as other bands from the 90's yet they remain one of the most powerful and original bands out there.  Most people don't realize that after their monstrous hit &quot;Creep&quot; Radiohead produced their best music.<br />This indeed is an album and not just a collection of songs.  From the first track &quot;Airbag&quot; all the way to the sixth track &quot;Karma Police&quot; the album flows seamlessly with emotional continuity and thought.  Thom Yorke's lyrics are haunting and deeply symbolic.  From rich layerd guitar sounds, out of this world keyboard riffs and of course Thom's unforgettable vocals the sound of this album is unforgettable.  I must have listened to this CD hundeds of times and it never gets old because there is always something new for me to discover.  What's great about OK Computer is that it combines the experimentation of Kid A and Amnesiac and the brilliant guitar work of The Bends.  Ok Computer won't disappoint and belongs in your music library.
B00006J3T4|3.0|I'm a big fan for a long time. So my opinion is not very dispassionate : i'll listen this album a lot of time. But the Knopfler we like (love) is the guitar man and there is no guitar in this album. I think he has recorded a CD only for himself. He has improved his way of singing and the songs are not bad but there are plenty other CD's like this one. One of the best track of TRD, &quot;Hill farmer blues&quot; is cut just at the moment the drum restart the song. Very frustrating!. <BR>However, a positive aspect of this album is the rootsy approach : more bluesy, country, jazzy: between golden heart, on every street and notting hillbillies.<BR>To conclude, don't worry Mark, i'll buy even a single star album.
0792838068|5.0|An alcoholic screenwriter who has ruined everything in his life takes a pocketful of money to Las Vegas with the intent of drinking himself to death. He meets a prostitute with her own problems and the two make a human connection at the absolute lowest points of their lives.<br /><br />Told with unflinching, often brutal, honesty, these two people are revealed in the courageous performances by Nicholas Cage and Elizabeth Shue. Cage and Shue have nailed their parts through the heart and the guts. He is, somewhere under it all, a good man, unable and unwilling to stop his self-destruction. Cage has this guy down, an alcoholic so far gone in his addiction that he can't stop drinking some form of alcohol for more than minutes. Shue matches his performance all the way as a pretty woman who has taken her own self-destructive slide for reasons we don't know. What we see of her work puts the lie to the Hollywood \\"happy-go-lucky hooker\\" once and for all, showing the danger and degradation in the life. She is abused when she has a pimp, but is in more dangerous territory without one.<br /><br />This is not a film for the faint-hearted, or those who see film as only \\"entertainment\\". This is tough stuff, so if all you want is to be made happy, save your money and skip this one. For others, like myself, you will find a film that doesn't \\"look away\\" at the ugliness, but somehow finds the humanity and the sad, lost worth of these people beneath it. These two see something in each other, discover a final caring they had buried beneath the hard bark and numbness of addiction and emotionless sex.<br /><br />No happy ending, either folks. Cage disintegrates before our eyes, and Shue has found feelings within her hard shell, but will it transform her? We can hope, but we don't know.<br /><br />Brilliantly acted and directed, both leads were nominated and Cage won the Academy Award. Shue was equally deserving. Mike Figgis was true to the material and made an exceptionally honest film, capturing the cold glitter of Las Vegas and providing a haunting score. I found Sting's \\"My One and Only Love\\" especially effecting in this context.<br /><br />I found this film devastating when I originally saw it. The scenes of Cage drunk and embarrassing himself in public were harsh and true. When he gets his stated dream of Shue pouring liquor down her [chest] for him by the pool, in the next instant he falls through the glass table ruining everything. He moves relentlessly to a touching but starkly unglamorous end. Shue's rape is brutal and the callousness she receives afterward is chilling. This film never flinches, and for that, many will dislike it. Seeing the DVD now, has reminded me again of the power of its honesty.<br /><br />Ultimately, a story of the loneliness of the human soul and the need to make some kind of contact with another human being, this searing, sad and knowing drama is well worthwhile for many reasons, if you've a mind for a different story, a strange kind of love story if you will. Indelible and unforgettable.
B00006J3T4|3.0|I'm a big fan for a long time. So my opinion is not very dispassionate : i'll listen this album a lot of time. But the Knopfler we like (love) is the guitar man and there is no guitar in this album. I think he has recorded a CD only for himself. He has improved his way of singing and the songs are not bad but there are plenty other CD's like this one. For instance,one of the best track of TRD, &quot;Hill farmer blues&quot; is cut just at the moment the drum restart the song. Very frustrating!. <br />However, a positive aspect of this album is the rootsy approach : more bluesy, country, jazzy: between golden heart, on every street and notting hillbillies.<BR>To conclude, don't worry Mark, i'll buy even a single star album.
B00005JL0I|3.0|Not to take anything away from the Flint films.  This is a classic Bond spoof, the scenes are well directed and the acting is pretty good. There would be no Austin Powers without this film, watch it and see why. hint: Peter Sellers. Not an Oscar winner, but highly entertaining!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|I have been a big fan of this movie for some time. And that is saying something because I hated the John Wayne type westerns. But this is a different and riveting movie, ably directed by Clint Eastwood and extremely well acted by all. The DVD sets has lots of extras and I really enjoyed the 20 minute or so feature on making the movie and the interviews with Clint and the rest of the cast. It was very interesting to see how they did some of the shots - even dispensing with horses in some scenes and perching the actors on stools to get some of the dialog without the movement of the horses. If you are a fan of the movie as I am, this is the DVD to buy.
B000021Y77|5.0|This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?
0446677450|4.0|Buy it use or get it from library.  Could be read in a weekend.
B00006HBUB|2.0|I was looking forward to buying this movie for my two boys ages 6 and 8.  I grew up with Scooby, and like them, he was my favorite cartoon character.  I ran right out and bought it today and boy what a dissappointment.  Their is a lot of bathroom humor in this film which surprised me.  It is certainly not the Scooby Doo that I grew up with.  My kids loved it, but I think that the film could have done without all of the bathroom humor....it was a bit ridiculous.  As I said, it's not the Scooby Doo that we see on TV.  Rent this movie before you decide to buy.
B0000640VO|5.0|After watching this film I'm now in love with foreign screenplays.  Amelie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  There's something about it where I smiled through the whole movie.  Definently recommended.
0316096199|5.0|Sebold has not only told an amazing real-life story, but she has told it well. Her writing is excellent; unobtrusive, straight-forward, insightful.
B00000DQWT|5.0|This is my favorite soundtrack. The opener with the boys choir is great (I am still trying to get the sheet music for that -- I have seen many similar items, but not that particular item -- even the band does not have it yet, but I asked anyway). The movie is closely intertwined with the music, especially songs like \\"Daulton Lee\\", \\"Level of Deception\\" and \\"This Is Not America\\". See the movie first, then get the soundtrack.
0451450523|5.0|Have you ever fallen in love with a book? <BR>Have you ever wanted to breathe the same air as all your faery-tale heroes?<BR>This book is enchanting. On the surface it is a childrens fantasy story, but if you just pick it up and read, you will find that it is like none other. It´s not just the great story. It´s the mood of the book, the whole surreal yet oh-so familiar feel that is part of every page, every word. The feeling youre left with at the end of this book is simply this:<br />True.<br />This is the one book. This is the book you want to read. This is the one you will love.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Only the \\"Perfect Strangers\\" reunion ranks higher. The songs have a modern, fresh sound to them. This is not your father's Deep Purple even though 4 out 5 members of the classic Mark II line up were still with the band when the album was release. The song which sounds like classic Deep Purple is Cacades:I'm not your lover. \\"The Aviator\\" sounds like an Irish/Celtic folk song. There is hints of Spanish stile guitar on Rosa's cantina, Hey Cisco, and the rocking \\"Someone stole my guitar.\\" The only weak point is the 70's Yes stile of \\"Soon Forgotten.\\"<br />Much of the lyrics are based on the true experiences of the band. No cornball lyrics here.<br />This album is mainly ballads here, so don't expect any sonic blasts. Go to \\"Abandon\\" if you want that.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Impressive debut from Jared Leto.  For those who think this is a band effort, read the album credits.  Nearly every instrument is played by Jared, with drums by Shannon Leto (sort of like Billy Corgan's recording techniques with the Smashing Pumpkins).  Getting the opening spot on Incubus' tour should help propel this CD to a level where more people get to hear it.  Maybe more bands like this would keep all the boring nu-metal off of the radio.
B0000640VO|5.0|After watching this film I'm now in love with foreign screenplays.  Amelie is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  There's something about it where I smiled through the whole movie.  Definently recommended.
B000001FND|4.0|While &quot;Horizontal&quot; contains some very good tracks (Lemons Never Forget, And The Sun Will Shine, Harry Braff, Birdie Told Me, Daytime Girl, Earnest of Being George), and hits (World, Massachussetts), there is a few that definately do not hold my interest.<br />You are better off getting this one as one of the last Bee Gees CDs if you are collecting their albums.<br />Don't get me wrong it's not a &quot;bad&quot; album, but not a Great album like the 1st album.
068981528X|5.0|This turn-about of the usual Three Little Pigs story is a nice \\"take\\" on the familiar tale.  I have used this with 1st grade gifted students who were already familiar with the traditional story to compare and contrast the two.  <br />It also lent itself nicely to a puppet show and the audience as well as the students enjoyed it tremendously.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|One of the best Psycho Thrillers I've ever seen.  You have to see it twice....just get's better and better every time.
B000021YQV|5.0|I have't read all of the reviews out there for this album but i am sure that there cannot be much left unsaid... Speaking as someone who is fed up with the over produced offerings of so called \\"Nu-metal\\" i can say that this is truly a step above filled with Insane chord progressions and arpeggios and wait you can actually make out the Bass guitar part...wow...and vocals that send shivers down my spine and raise the hairs on the back of my neck. I wait with bated breath for a follow up!!
B0000019HU|4.0|...but not enough to gush on and on like half the reviewers on here.  Jeez, it's like indie fans are more obsessive and excitable than the girls that read teenybopper magazines and have ten posters of their favorite band on their wall.  It's just music, lighten up a bit.<br />Anyhoo, this is a fantastic record.  It is worth the price of admission just for the end of the last song.  People keep going on about that part, and they are right.  Bands like Mogwai try to emulate this kind of loud/soft thing, and don't get me wrong, Mogwai is good, but they don't pull it off like Slint.  <br />A little pretentious though.  The vocals in particular.  You are on dangerous ground when you use spoken word in a song.  It can come off really bad in the wrong hands.  It is a bit &quot;coffeeshop&quot; for my tastes.  Not terrible, though.  Also, that nonsense about vinyl has got to stop.  CDs are superior, and if you want that warm vinyl sound you can just play around with the equalizer until you get it to sound right.  If you want to hear clicks and pops and hissing you could put that on a cd.  They could just master it from vinyl.<br />Even if I'm wrong about vinyl vs. CD (and I bloody well doubt it,) it isn't like poor sound quality could ruin a terrific record like Spiderland.  Your collection is incomplete without this record or cd.
B000002TP7|5.0|damn dude.....this album is a pretty interisting hip-hop album....is full of rare and weird samples and great lyrics and nasty funny rhymes.......is the first great album of the beastie boys.....oh yeah and pretty good instrumentals from bobo of cypress hill and that dude......oh man what's his name?.....oh yeah!q-tip!......is pretty awesome.....but the beastie boys are been kinda shy these days.....something's wrong I think!.....compralo mija!....I mean....buy it!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|all i have to say is that this movie is a must have in a dvd collection...at first i thought that this movie would be lame and typical just because of the title itself but boy was i wrong, its one of those movies that stay in your head and makes you wanna watch it over again. it has really cool 80's songs that unfortunately arent in the soundtrack.
B00005JKCF|4.0|This is the best bigscreen adaptation of a major comic superhero that I've seen, much better than the chaotic messes of Burton's Batman films (though I thought Michael Keaton was excellent as Batman). Tobey Maguire's characterization of Peter Parker/Spiderman is perfect, though I do hope he doesn't get limited to the role, since he is probably the best Hollywood male actor of the twenty-something age group. <br />Sometimes I think Raimi still goes for too much close-up violence in that sort of goofy but sadistic cult director way (as does Peter Jackson in Lord of the Rings), but overall this is a serious action hero movie that manages to have some fun. It sticks pretty close to the Spiderman many will know from the 60s comic book, but the story and conceits have been largely updated for this century.<br />Here's hoping Ben Affleck as Daredevil (another Marvel favorite of mine) turns out as good.
6305078491|3.0|This is a great film, but sadly an awful print has been used as the master copy, and makes the viewing of this classic horror  film, a real nightmare. PLEASE CRITERION, BUY THE RIGHTS TO THIS FILM AND FIX IT UP!
0064400557|5.0|This has got to be one of the best children's books ever. The message is timeless. It is entertaining, yet teaches so many important lessons. My 8 year old loves this book. Highly recommend!!
B000069CWE|5.0|This is the first remix i have bought but then again it's linkin park. which no matter what u know it good music.  <BR>i heard it the day before it was released and i really enjoyed it all the way through.  It just flowed so nicely.  The reinterpretation is awesomely done.  how one song in hybrid theory has more feelin in the words and the way it is interpreted<BR>to a different sound in chesters voice.  Two completely different versions of it.  It shows how much talent chazzy chaz has and the whole crew in general
B00000612G|4.0|There is no arena bombast to be found on Richie Sambora's 'Undiscovered Soul.' Even the upbeat songs are practically acoustic jaunts that thrive on creative vigor more than amplified exuberance. It's easy to get the impression that Richie Sambora's just a really nice guy, this album shows a songwriter who really doesn't have a lot of problems and who's content to share with us his content and his committment to his world. It's a gentle record, something you can play in the background instead of blasting down the street.<br />The standout tunes are 'Hard Times Come Easy' an upbeat rocker and 'All That Really Matters' an unabashed dedication from Sambora to his wife. <br />Lots of artists claim to be writing albums for themselves first, with 'Undiscovered Soul,' I can believe Richie Sambora wrote an album for himself, that we, the listeners, can't help but enjoy. It's just a really nice record.
B00005221L|5.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in Predator, a hit box office film that hit the shelves and automatically flew off within the few first months of its release. This film has always been one of my favorites from Arnold, ever since I was 12 years old. When I finally went out and purchased a DVD Player, Predator was one of the very first DVDs that came to mind, because, 1)I knew a spectacluar film had to produce a spectacluar DVD, and 2)I would finally get to see this film in widescreen anamorphic format with 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound.<br />This isn't just an action movie, its a sci-fi/action/suspense movie with a pot full of astonishing actors. I give credit to the directors of this film for choosing such an excellent cast. A cast that includes Sonny Landham, Carl Weathers, Jesse Ventura, and Arnold Schwarzenegger. And who could forget the HUGE 7 foot tall Keven Peter Hall that played the Predator. This is one of the films that set Arnold Schwarzenegger to fame through the 90s, also backed up by Commando and The Terminator, which were also box office hits as well (I have those on DVD also). It seems almost every film Schwarzenegger has starred in has produced a spectacluar DVD.<br />I believe there are two different versions of this DVD; one has the full screen version and THX Surround Sound, and the other one has the Widescreen version, THX Surround Sound, 5.1 Dolby Digital, and extra features. The latter of the two is somewhat rare...I haven't seen many copies, but I was fortunate enough to find one in [a store]somewhere.<br />This film is great, and the DVD is even better. Many scenes really capture the effects of the THX which adds to the climax and the recessive parts of the movie. The audio and visual effects of this DVD are AWESOME, and I'd encourage anyone that has a DVD Player and likes action films to get this. Great movie by a great director, played by a great cast. No disappointment here.
B0000065TL|4.0|I've seen the Girlie Show which I thought was spectacular but as a behind the scenes look this was okay too. Though I think that it skirts the insight of her as a businesswoman, the labogorious meetings, teh lawyers, the accountants, the business structuring and also very limited access to her home. This also needed a reporter of some kind asking her definitive questions, a shadow reporter if you will. <BR>Though the freestyle works of sometimes simply being a fly on the wall, there seems to be some shielding to who she is. Which is troublesome on one level and applaudable on another. We shouldn't have TOTAL access to her life, she deserves privacy as we all do, even if she has chosen the public spotlight. But at the same time what is her goal here?<BR>Did I get to know Madonna better? Somewhat but there's so much flurry around her that often times its hard to see if she's orchestrator or along for the ride or perhaps some days there is no difference.?<BR>She's interesting, yes. But at the same time strident and I don't think thats because she's a strident person but because there is so much for her attention to manage. And at the same time 99% of the people around her are on her payroll or subject to her whims. It puts her in a position where for her artistic vision she may want to get her own way and at the same time she has to constantly war with the maturity of listening to others and deferring. It must be a hard balancing act to maintain control and flexibility when the whole show is YOU.<BR>Admirable.
0684800713|3.0|The Sun Also Rises<br /> The Sun Also rises is no cliche love story where boy falls in love with girl, <BR>girl falls in love with boy, they get married and live happily ever after.  In this sense the book is good.  The  author does not rely on cliche and has a unique writing style which carries the story forward with an interesting rhythm. <BR> <BR>   The themes of the book seem to be love and money.  Nothing out of the ordinary, <BR>but it is highly exaggerated and confused. <BR> In this book money is very important.  Money brings friends, love and happiness. <BR> The more you spend money the happier and more loved you will be.  <BR>Most of these expenses are frivolous.  Mostly money is spent in bars, travel and \\"partying\\".  Partying is also highly valued.  Partying and wine or anything that can get you drunk.  <BR> <BR> With all these priorities love is only a feeling in the background.  <BR>             Infatuation invokes attention more than any feelings of  true love.  <BR>             True love rarely appears and is ignored when it does.<BR>  <BR>  This story took place mainly in France and in Spain.  If you have never been in France or Spain this book eagerly attempts to show them to you, but in a stereotypical sense.<BR> <BR> Personally I did not like the book.  I found it hard to relate to and the occasional phrases in French did not make it easier.  Nothing much happens in the way of a plot either.  There is a lot of dialogue which is hard to follow because it is hard to tell whose talking.  You have to concentrate to understand what you are reading which some people may find intriguing but if you skip a few pages you wont miss much!
B000066NW0|5.0|All right, I will admit that I was skeptical of this CD at first.  I liked 'Complicated' a lot, but was uncertain if this CD would be good or just another pop star that has every possibility of [going bad].  Well...I listened to the disc finally, and I am sorry, but this stuff just rocks.  Not only is Avril probably one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, but she is just a righteous rocker chick.  I am sorry, but girls that play guitar and rock out while tossing their hair, that is just hot!  This young lady is very talented and her CD is one of uniqueness, honesty and fun.  I came away with a big smile on my face because this CD is just fun to listen to.  It's got great melody in the instrumentals and Avril has an amazing voice.  No Britney Spears here people!  Clear the way for Avril Lavigne!
B0000009RT|5.0|\\"Freak Out\\" - FZ's 1966 debut album - is my personal favorite. This album has almost all of the diverse music styles in it that Zappa would continue to use and develope throughout his 27 years of recording. There are songs that are very funny (\\"Wowie Zowie\\", \\"You're Probably Wondering Why I'm Here\\"); One Doo-wop track (\\"Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder\\"); A few totally weird ones(\\"Who Are The Brain Police?\\", \\"Help, I'm A Rock/It Can't Happen Here\\"); Songs on social commentary: one light-hearted \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\\" and the other serious and uncompromising \\"Trouble Every Day\\". <BR>Frank Zappa was known for his instrumentals along with his sometimes raunchy, but always hilarious, songwriting. He seldom wrote serious songs but when he did, they were excellent. \\"How Could I Be Such A Fool\\" is a perfect example. Also on this album is the most-catchy tune about suicide ever recorded \\"I'm Not Satisfied\\"; Catchy optimisitc tunes \\"Any Way The Wind Blows\\" and \\"Motherly Love\\" and down-beat, self-pity diddys \\"I ain't Got no Heart\\" and \\"You Didn't Try To Call Me\\". The music variety on Freak Out is abundant. The only thing Freak Out doesn't contain is an instrumental song. But you'll hear more of them on many other albums you listen to. Probably not the best place to start. To truly appreciate this album, I recommend \\"Strictly Commercial\\" - his greatest hits as the first album to get. It only scratches the surface of Zappa's career but is perfect for a beginning listener. As you get more and more into Zappa, you will find \\"Strictly Commercial\\" more and more expendable. Then listen to one of his most popular albums, \\"Over-nite Sensation\\", to grasp his unique satire and humor. If you enjoyed those two albums, then listen to Freak Out. You won't be disappointed. I promise.
B000002L7R|5.0|Yes it followed Purple Rain.  Yes, you can't follow up such artistry, you can simple explore new areas, which is ultimately what Prince does.  Having collected Prince for years, truly listened to the span of his music, I can say that there is both a consciousness to it.  By that I mean that you can see (hear) a singular mind behind the creations, an affinity to certain sounds, melodies and then you can also see the recreation and even further improvisation upon his own work.  In a sense Prince's work, his thought is never completed because it is constantly reinformed, reformed, restateable.<br />And thats what even makes the &quot;bad&quot; albums admirable.  In an artform where popular,rich, successful musicians rely upon old formulas, old collaborations to try and create hits, Prince has already been to the mountaintop.  Was his rise meteoric?  Perhaps within the context of only a few years from initial albums to mega-success albums.  But in truth he's exploring the hills and valleys and cliffsides and pathways around his mountain.  And it is his mountain.  He is his only competition and he refuses to compete with himself.<br />I write.  Stories, books, articles and each creation is something anew and yet I can return to what was &quot;perfect&quot; yesterday and find a new permutation, a new juxtaposition.  Someone once told me that one of my stories didn't hit the mark of my others but I personally enjoyed the &quot;failure&quot; because it took me in a new direction.<br />So this CD, not the mega hit of Purple Rain gives us Pop Life, America and Around the World In a Day.  Not just classics in the Prince lexicon but also permutations.  Another excellent coloring of a canvas by a master artist.<br />Again another homerun from Prince Rogers Nelson.

0380778556|5.0|I don't read mysteries but I really had fun reading &quot;Rebecca&quot;. It was recommended to me by a friend &amp; like all the reviews, I agree that it started out slow &amp; boring, but don't lose hope. I almost did. I know this is a good novel because I was never able to tell what was going to happen next. It is such an inventive novel &amp; I love how descriptive it is. I gave it 5 stars because, other than the ending, was pretty much perfect. It being old makes it all the much better. Mysteries today seem like they were made on an assembly line. I do think everyone should read this one, though.
B00006J3WH|4.0|Joss Whedon certainly didn't embarrass himself as he initially feared he would when he began writing the songs for the musical episode, and his allegiance to idol Stephen Sondheim really payed off in the long run. Despite some of the cast's limitations, I really don't have a problem with any of the performances since Whedon did a fabulous job of gearing the songs to accomodate their strengths as well as their characters' personalities. My one disappointment with the episode itself was the void left after it became apparent that Willow would be the only character without a showcase number. I don't think I would have minded too much if they found a Willowy voice double for Alyson Hannigan to lip-synch to as long as my favorite character got to be in the searing spotlight for a few minutes. My nitpicky complaints about the soundtrack would include my confusion over why the Main Title theme came after the End Credits rather than at the beginning where it belongs chronologically. Either the listing here is incorrect or something's been changed since I received my copy. I would agree with others that appropriate dialogue and sound effects would have filled out a few of the tracks without disrupting the flow of each song. Also, \\"The Mustard,\\" \\"The Parking Ticket,\\" and \\"Broom Dance\\" could have been combined with some new snippets to form a Street Suite, but that's just showing how anal I can be rather than how flawed the soundtrack is. What I also wanted to hear as a bonus was one of the demos Joss Whedon and Kai Cole recorded once I heard about them before the episode aired. Glad they were able to accomodate me on that one, because it's a real treat! Congratulations to Chris Beck, not only for his work on the musical episode (which he told me a good season ahead of time would be the highlight of his career), but also for the compositions from other episodes included on the CD. All in all, it's wicked marvelous, as Joss might describe it.<br />For the record, Mustard Guy was portrayed by writer David Fury, not David Greenwalt as was mentioned in a couple of the other reviews. I was set to play MG in a loose production of \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" but arrived too late to do so. Meeting Fury the following day certainly made up for it.
B000002LE6|5.0|Ok, 45 solid minutes of song to song to song, in the tradition of Marvin Gaye who believed that an album should flow, not be interrupted even by a moments silence, as the music is continuous in thought to creation to instrument to recording.  Should you buy this at full price?  Yes.<BR>When love calls you got to go.<BR>Lovesexy, Alphabet Street, Anastesia, on and on.<BR>It sounds like a party, a room full of moving, grinding people, a new one at the mike, different incarnations of even Prince himself.<BR>As always royalty worthy of worship.
B00006J3T4|4.0|Oh, the lyrics are kind of depressing, but Mark Knopfler's elegant, perfect guitar playing makes me want to lick something.  I will definitely be putting this into heavy rotation on my home CD player.
B00005UM42|5.0|Its hard to believe this movie is over 40 years old,but it retains its power and passion in what is one of the most underrated westerns ever filmed.  True to form,it is a very serious movie but wasn't Brando always serious?  However,any serious DVD collector should not be without this version of the movie,its in Widescreen and the visuals are stunning.  It is at a bargain price at present so I would urge any western buff to grab it immediately
0965093670|5.0|This book will make you think differently about your restaurant dining experiences but not necessarily in a bad way. <br />In particular it will make you appreciate all the effort that goes into putting together a top class dining experience. Yes, there are some nasty stories about rats and bacteria but this is probably nothing you hadn't already suspected if you're a foodie like me.<br />There are a few terms that a non-US reader might be perplexed by - red sauce for example, which isn't a term we know in the antipodes.<br />Definitely a good read for anyone who enjoys food preparation or dining out.

0920668372|5.0|This story is often misconstrued by adults.  My mother bought this book for me when I was 7 and I have loved it ever since.  I am now 21 and if I ever decide to have children, this is one of the first books I would give to them.  It is a tender story of devotion and love; something this world is lacking in.  I highly suggest you find a copy of this book and read it for yourself, so you are not mislead by negative reviews.

B00005UK1F|5.0|I'VE ONLY BEEN HEARING GREAT REVIEWS OF THIS CD. I BOUGHT IT ON HEAR SAY, WHICH IS SOMETHING I NEVER DO. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO METAL SINCE I WAS 13 I'M 30 NOW.I BEGAN TO GET BORED OF METAL THIS PAST YEAR.I GUESS I MAY BE OUT GROWING THE METAL THAT JUST BEATS YOU UP WITH BRUTALILTY. I BOUGHT THE GREEN CARNATION, NOW IT WASN'T BRUTAL BUT I GOT MY BUTT KICKED BY PURE TALENT. I LISTENED TO THIS CD, I GOT UP WHEN IT WAS OVER AND PRESSED PLAY AGAIN. I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I HAD HEARD. THE GREEN CARNATION IS MORE THAN METAL IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT IT IS OTHER THAN REALY GOOD.
B00005JL3A|2.0|Not being an owner of a game console such as a Playstation and the like, I have never spent much time actually playing any of the Resident Evil series. I tried to play them on my PC, but it always seemed like my top of the line PC was being dumbed down by playing console games on it, like it was getting a headache trying to think on the same level as a console. That said, I have however seen the games played by many of friends and know the Resident Evil stories, read some of the comics and a couple of the novels. I know and like the characters and all of the playable ones like Claire Redfield or Jill Valentine. Both have one quality, among others, that Mila Jovovich lacks in abundance- her character Alice is not very likeable. In fact, she isn't much of anything, she isn't even that attractive.<br /> The Resident Evil movie also has very little in common with its console video game forebears- other than it's title and that it has an evil corporation named Umbrella which has made a terrible virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies. Now, to me, this sounds like a match made in heaven. I'm a graduate of the George A. Romero school of zombie flicks and cut my teeth on Night, Dawn and Day of the Dead. I make no apologies for like spectacular gore- I want to see people being ripped in half with their intestines and other organs spilling out on the floor with wet goopy splatting noises like a bowl of rotten fruits being tipped over. I want limbs hacked off. I want people using 500 bullets to kill something instead of using just one. I want Peter Jackson `Bad Taste' and `Brain Damage' level gore. Resident Evil the movie has flesh eating zombies, but very little gore, very little actual eating of flesh. Almost none. So, what's the point?<br /> Anyway, the film is pretty much an amalgamation of some of the game stories, namely the virus being released and Umbrella trying to cover it up by gassing the residents of a watch house after someone attempts to steal the virus and purposely releases it. Alice, who awakes in the shower, has no memories of her past and is suddenly thrust in the middle of a commando raid as Umbrella attempts to gain access to `The Hive'- their massive underground research facility where the `T'-virus was made and subsequently released. Now, in the video game, everything Umbrella owns is made of rusted steel and looks to be about a hundred years old or painted a sickly medicinal green and splattered with mud and blood. The film, however, everything is cut from polished stainless steel and aluminum, all very sanitary and high tech, which doesn't fit the milieu.<br /> The commandos realize they'll have take down a powerful hologram-based AI known as the Red Queen, because she controls the whole Hive and they suspect she's insane. Entering through a glass corridor we get to watch as most of the team is cut into meat by lasers, including the grid laser seen in the commercial. But they wimp out- we barely see Number 1 cut into giblets Sylvester-running-through-the-chain-link-fence style, and get a semi decent slow motion decapitation. Now, in my mind, after the first laser had passed and killed two of the commandos, the next obvious move would be to roll a couple of grenades down the hallway- made entirely out of glass!! Instead, no, everyone dies, leaving only Alice, three commandos and a ineffectual cop to deal with it all.<br /> All in all, this film is nothing like the video games. None of its characters are likeable and truth be told, I wanted them all to die. However, the production values are very high and they obviously put a lot of care and thought into the end product. I'm also a big fan of Jon Anderson- Event Horizon will always be one of my favorite films. But in Resident Evil he changed too much, took too much away from the games that made them so effective. Very few of the monsters made it to the screen save for the lickers, which were underused and the undead skinless dogs, again, underused. Notice I have said much about the zombies? I haven't because there aren't exactly a lot of them, nor a lot of scenes with them.<br /> It's a zombie movie! For crying out loud, this is what people paid money to see and they give a very poor account of themselves. In this is where the film really falls apart- the zombies just didn't look dead enough, for the most part. It's like the make-up artists gave up before they were finished. The zombies didn't looked decayed enough, weren't feral enough, weren't missing enough body parts or bleeding enough. In short, they were one of the least satisfying portions of the film. I want gore...not scene after scene of high tech equipment and mean spirited characters with very few redeeming qualities. Dawn of the Dead could get away with being a character drama as well as a satirical portrait and scathing indictment of our consumerism-based society. Resident Evil is about gore and killing zombies in as many disgusting ways as possible and nothing else. Worse, the music had me reaching for an icepick to puncture my own eardrums it was so terrible.
B00005B36H|5.0|From the moment the first vibrations reach your ears, on the very first song, entitled &quot;The Grudge&quot;, one can sense an almost omniscient feel about the album.  This time, inner speculation is correct, as this album goes far beyond and above the majority of most &quot;music&quot; today.  Tool utilizes every instrument, ignoring the term &quot;background music&quot;, and bringing into light the guitar of Adam Jones, the Bass of Justin Chancellor, the Drums of Danny Carey, and the Vocals of Maynard James Keenan.  <br />This intoxicating album has such mesmerizing tracks as &quot;Schism&quot;, combined with the more upbeat, powerful music of &quot;Parabola&quot;, and the sedetive &quot;Triad&quot;.  If you are looking for an album that transcends modern music; an album that entices not only your ears, but your soul, than I suggest to you Lateralus.
0316666343|5.0|This is a profoundly resonant story for me, from the first flat recital by the narrator of her date of death, and age at the time, fourteen. <br />She is the person who disappears, traces of whose body are found just before all hope of finding her alive vanishes. The national news picks it up now, linking our thoughts with the latest victims from Virginia to California. We are spectators - or even survivors- and we all have our voices. The child does not. <br />Sebold speaks for the child, one girl. In heaven, she does not remain in that stasis we associate with a Platonic place of rest. She is watching. And she is growing. Because as every survivor knows, however scared you are, you are thinking of your family and how they will function after they know they have lost you. Susie Salmon cannot help her family at first, and she finds that she knew them a little less well than she thought. Just by observing them, she grows in understanding and perhaps in influence over their actions, as a kind of grace-bearer. Her death affects her school, her friends, the world. The ripples go far beyond the horrible moment it took to kill. And what of the murderer? He gains in skill and confidence, taking in just about everyone, the way such people do. His victim understands him better with time, but there is no forgiveness because he never repents, but keeps killing.<br />It's a page-turner. In some ways, it reminds me of The Giver because of the fantastic premise. <br />How much do you prepare a child to deal with the real threats posed by the abductors and killers? As much as you can. But relative strength being what it is, this is not always possible. <br />For everyone who did not get away to swim another day, Susie Salmon speaks, confronting us with the very riddle of existence. Can she come back? Or, to paraphrase Emily of Our Town (a reference not quoted but mentioned in the book)- \\"Does anybody really live life while they're living it, every, every minute?\\"<br />She wants desperately to have a life. Somehow, she does.
B000002GFT|5.0|I've had this work for a long time.  I rarely listened to the LP because I thought the sound was very flat, especially compared to their previous 2 LPs.  That kept me from buying the CD for a long time.  Well, I finally acquired the CD and am very happy with it.  The sound is much improved over the LP and this album is now a delight for the ear and takes its proper place in the Fairport pantheon.  <br />I love it!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|I like this album, I like the lyrics, I like her voice, I like the music. She wite as people do in her age, that dosent disturb me, she writes about her life in her own words. She are one of the few who have the courage to write her own lyrics, thats not common if you are as young as she is. We have no paid expert songwrites here, and if you read this Avril, do never pay others to write your lyrics, your lyrics are as good as it gets. <BR>Maybe her music isnt real punk music. But in her sould and in her thoughts she is a real skater, that is no doubt in that. I bought this album yesterday, I like rockmusic. I have albums with U2, R.E.M, Metallica and... Avril Lavinge.
B00000DLUV|5.0|This CD is actually the best sampling of Gibb music you can get!!<BR>It has all the hits and a few early music nuggets for the 60's fans. You can do one better with the DVD!!
B0000542D2|1.0|Some things are just inexpicable.  DVD gives us the possibility of the sharpest vidoe images combined with the awesome sound of Dolby Digital or DTS.  So how excited was I when, finally, the announcement came that A Hard Day's Night was finally going to be given the deluxe treatment.<br />What a joke!  Oh, the video quality is just fine, but one would expect that.  The big mystery is WHAT HAPPENED TO THE AUDIO??!!  Incredibly anemic is the only way I can describe it.  I have to turn my volume level twice as loud as on other DVDs to even get a listenable level.  But that's only the start.  It is in MONO, for God's sake!  And that's not all...there is NO dynamic range, no depth to the sound, no quality in the midrange or high end, and a low end that is boomy and without definition.  I could get a better sound by setting up an old Radio Shack microphone in a garage..sadly, that is not a joke.  But this DVD is.  I am going to write Miramax and demand to know what happened.  Once again, the Beatles fan has been exploited.  Please, if you have not yet bought this, DON'T!
0060977493|5.0|A great story must be propelled by a majestic myth. The myth behind Arundhati Roy's fascinating tale,The God of Small Things, is universally known and powerful. It is the myth of  the Garden of Eden.<br />Like Eden, the garden of the tale is planted with fruit trees, bananas, jackfruits, mangoes, nuts and citrus; and it is a working garden, a tropical paradise, for the produce is used to make preserves and pickles. This eden has its boundaries, a small but swift river, dangerous in flood, and a vaguely described world road that leads first to the villiage Ayemenem, then to Kottayam,the county seat of  Kerala, and, far to the East-of-Eden lies Calcutta.  Eden has is symbols, too: its denizens are Syrian Christians, transplanted to India ages ago and stuck in the midst of a mixed pagan and Hindu milieu. Inside the garden is innocence; outside, there is an ugly world fraught with temptation and the seven deadly sins which include pride, sloth, lust, greed, and the Indian caste system.  The innocence is impersonated in the two protagonists who are \\"two-egg\\" twins, an Adam brother (Estha) and an Eve sister (Rahel). There is a serpent in eden; she is great-aunt Baby Kochamma. There is a god in this eden; he is uncle Chacko and he's omniscient because he has been schooled in paradise, as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxenford. As God, however, Chacko is manque, for he has neglected or failed to banish the god of small things from his creation, the Tohu and Bohu of  Genesis (mistranslated as Formlessness and Darkness). Chacko gives eden its neo-Genesis by making of it a productive garden--a pickle factory which employs the needy of the region, including some untouchables (horribile dictu), in low-skilled jobs. His grandfather was a colonist who ran a latex plantation for profit by exploiting these people. The mansion of the latefundia lies outside the garden on the other side of the river; and it is this place, called the History House, which represents the Tree of  Knowledge of Goodand Evil. So this eden has a history. The do-unto-others morality is represented by communism, and Chacko is a comrade, but one without credentials. Hence the ambient morality is conditional and corrupted by politics. God, too, has a history; for, while he was absent in paradise, he had a wife and made a child. And this beautiful, white-skinned flaxen haired Lilith, called Sophie Mol, comes to Eden. That is the beginning of the tragedy--knowledge, folly, deceit, murder and banishment.<br />A moving story must be propelled by drama. The drama behind The God of Small Things is archaic. Its action is simple: a reunion. Reunions are comedic, but any element of comedy or happiness Ms. Roy has studiously avoided here. The dramatis personae are two; it is then an Aeschylean tragedy. But the protagonists do not utter a word; only their act of reunion described. The rest is told by the chorus, as in Aeschylus. The chorus in this novelized drama has the voice of the omniscient narrator which often takes voice as the recollection of Rahel. The utterances of the chorus are sheer poetry, as in Aeschylus full of surprising neologisms and unusual rhythms, and it is reminiscent, as in the Agamemnon, making our knowledge of the events and motivations complete by cyclical repetition.<br />This book is a masterwork. The syndics of the Booker prize are to be lauded for their perspicacity in choosing the work of a tyro for the prize, for by a tyro or not, Ms. Roy's novel is bound to become a classic.
6305508550|4.0|What makes good comedy really funny is an element of truth.  Office Space has more than just an element.  Who hasn't worked in an office setting, and heard those words, &quot;What's the matter with you, didn't you get that memo?&quot;, or something to that effect.  The whole film is about a working &quot;life&quot; in a dull office that is very reality based.  It makes me wonder if Mike Judge spent all of his time working in an office job that he hated, before going on to create Beavis and Butthead.<br />The movie offers loads of belittling contempt for those condescending and overbearing office managers and for those brought in to assist with the downsizing of a company.  The movie even offers a way out for the protagonist in the story.  Watching his story made me think that the way he drifted away from his life of each day being worse than the next might just work.  Ron Livingston reminded me of Ferris Buehler in this movie, which was a good thing.<br />The movie has plenty of laughs for those that have worked any kind of office job.  It would be so funny . . . if it weren't so true, but you'll laugh anyway.<br />As a DVD, the movie in this medium doesn't offer that much.  I'm still looking for the easter eggs on this disc, but haven't found any.
0316666343|5.0|Read this one twice.  Once for yourself, and once for everyone that you've ever loved - those that you remember, and more importantly, those that you do not.
B00006FDCD|4.0|This TV mini series was a frightener when released during the 90's. Tim Curry did an excellent job as Pennywise the clown just as he did in his cult classic &quot;LEGEND&quot;. Whats good about this DVD is you get a better look at the movie thanks to the quality of the DVD and the special commentary track added to the film's special features that are inserted in this disc. The color and resolution is much better  and the widescreen helps out a lot. I strongly recommmend you buy this disc to add it to your horror DVD collection. If you own the video your missing out on the next bestb thing.
B00005R87Q|5.0|This movie is the best one I've seen in a long time, and I watch movies a lot.  The sweetest cars are in the movie, the actors/actresses do a very good job and there is a suspeseful plot. Anybody who likes one of the following will love this movie: cars, hot girls, hot guys(says the girls), action, or good actors.  The DVD version is even better, there are bonus features. The movie is wicked and the bonus stuff is the only thing that could make it better.  I extremely reccomend this movie, and if you dont buy it, at least watch it.
B00004TJJZ|5.0|I was the first person in the theater the day this movie came out after having watched previews for almost a year.  I have to admit that the first time I saw it, I didn't really like it at all.  I thought the story was amusing, but the humor just didn't sink in.  But then, I watched it again.<br />Since then, I have watched this movie probably close to a hundred times, and I think it gets funnier every time.  This movies certainly grows on you.  Despite my very large number of viewings, I still notice things in the movie that I haven't ever noticed before.<br />This movie is a masterpiece of subtle nuances.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, something else dawns on you, making the movie even more fantastic than you ever thought.  I would highly recommend this movie to any serious sci-fi fan (though having spent a lot of time around Trekkie types, I can't imagine one who hasn't seen this movie by now!) or to anyone who wants to laugh riotously throughout an incredibly witty, absolutely hilarious movie.  The tension between Smith and Jones is perfect and the deadpan humor is amazing.  I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B00005U16N|5.0|I won't go into much detail about the movie since there's enough of that already. I just wanted to comment that this not only is a story about the rise and fall of a notorious drug dealer, but also the story of a man and his family. It's about the love a father has for his daughter and the promises that he tries but in the end can't keep. In the beginning of the movie, George Jung(Johnny Depp) deals drugs to make money. After his daughter is born though, he gets out of the business and tries unsuccessfully to lead a more 'normal' life with his wife and kid. In the end though it all falls apart for him since he's penniless and dismissed by both his wife and daughter. It's a tragic story that will leave one with the pangs of regret for not only the mistakes that Jung made but also of the love he missed out from his daughter,ie. his whole world.
B00006FDHI|5.0|I would recommend purchasing this movie for the music along, but the plot and acting is superb also.
B000003TA4|5.0|Probably one of the best top 5 rock albums of ALL time. No kidding! Just buy this record and you'll know why. Sold an unbelievable 10 million copies. To go platinum is extremely rare for a rock album. Nirvana's nevermind is surely a must buy!
B000002KBA|5.0|This album is a milestone in heavy rock. It still sounds fresh today. The sheer power and dynamism of this still blows me away. 1970 was very much a hinge point in music - this was the era of seriously BIG music. When you compare this to the shallow, mindless , manufactured ... that passes for popular music now - you can only ask yourself \\"where did it go astray?\\"<br />This genre of music rocked then - it rocks now. This has passion, anger, aggression - this is music to get a speeding ticket to (Speed King?!). Go for it! DP, we salute you!
0316666343|4.0|As an often disappointed reader of modern fiction I can say this book was far from disappointing.<br />The author launches into a tale that is both grim and tender with an amazing certainty. The prose is beautiful and the telling of the story is bold-- confident.<br />There were some parts in the narrative that might be weaknesses, might be me. I never really understood Susie's heaven. It seemed melancholy and like a slow kind of torture. It was more like hell. You can see the ones you love, see their struggles more clearly than when you were alive but there is nothing you can do for them.<br />The last hundred pages unraveled just a bit. I found myself wondering at all the far reaching threads that kept being pulled into the narrative. The ending had the feel that it was time to wrap things up. It didn't have the confidence or certainty of the first 200 pages. It's a subtle drop off, though.<br />Overall, it's one heck of a read.
B000059T1V|5.0|This is the concert that inspired the likes of Eric Burdon, Clapton, Winwood, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards, Jimmy Page...this is a must for blues and rock n' roll collectors.  The sound is live, probably Muddy's best live recording.  I would like to find the video/35mm film to this.  I also recommend &quot;Hard Again&quot; by Muddy with the help of James Cotton (who is also on this live recording) and Johnny Winter.  The man is missed.
B00005MP58|5.0|Oh how I adored this miniseries!!! I am obsessed with not only this time period, but with England in general..let me tell you this film did not disappoint!! The Bennett family was hysterical...Mrs. Bennet in particular...oh and the ending was so satisfying...Such a charming story!!!...my only advice is this...set aside a nice big block of time to watch..its agonizing to shut it off before its finished!!!
6302968119|4.0|Great movie, recently recommended as a &quot;re-rent&quot; by Roger Ebert's new partner (can't remember his name).  Outstanding performances by Gary Oldman (a personal fave) Christian Slater and Dennis Hopper.  James Gandolfini and Christopher Walken add hard-edged muscle to the well-written script.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the show.  I can't believe that Joss Whedon has so much room in his brain by producing so many great shows.  The musical idea was great and I have not seen the episdoe yet as I missed it.  However, I bought the CD and I'm a hooked.  By taking the voice ranges of the cast and creating some great music and lyrics that make me think!.  The show makes me think but it also entertains, it's funny, and poignant and sometimes sad.  But the music is a huge kick.  I would love to ask the radio station to play James Marsters, belting out \\"Rest in Peace\\".  Also, Sarah Michelle Gellar has a pleasant voice, and has proved she is a professional as her performance is outstanding.  The cut \\"Walk through the Fire\\", my three kids, ages 5, 6 ,and 9, love the song and sing it in the car.  We are a Buffy family and would recommend this CD.  Emma Caufield, Nicholas Brendan do a splendid job.  Though I don't think that singing is in the cards for Emma -  but she performs well.  Giles of course has a great voice along with Amber Benson.  <br />Buy this CD and you won't be disappointed as you will be singing the lyrics as well.  That tells you the composer,lyrics writer has done is job!  Fantastic!  Bravo, Joss Whedon, Staff and performers of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  <br />Thank You<BR>Karen
B00004YYDI|5.0|Great movie!  Strange sexual tension between pre-pubescent Natalie Portman and Jean Reno -- but it only adds to the surreal feel of the movie.  Great plot, great story, great acting, GREAT action sequences, and great characters.  Great all the way around.  And I don't want to ruin the ending (so stop reading if you haven't yet seen it), but it's refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't have a happy (or predictable) ending -- even if it is so sad.
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen.  As a Christian, the attitude of Jeremy Iron's character is one we should all hope to emulate - sacrificial, loving, and above all else interested in serving God.  It's an inspiration.<br />My favorite part of the movie by far was the debate between De Niro and Irons over whether or not the Jesuits should resist the soldiers coming to kill or capture them.  It's an argument that still rages on in the Church - whether or not we should physically resist evil.<br />I cried when the native priest was forced to disrobe by the soldiers burning down the monastery.  It's so sad to see such things, even when dramatized in a movie.<br />Basically, this is one the most touching, moving, breath taking movies ever to have been made.
B00006G9KW|3.0|My old roommate left this book at my house when he moved out. It sat their for about a year. The only experience I had ever had with a Ken Follet novel was years before when I read \\"The Third Twin\\". I was not very impressed with that book, and from then on I had decided to steer clear of the entire Follet scene. Hence my disappointment, when I heard a car horn honk and I saw myself grabbing the Follet book as I dashed out the door for a long weekend at a cottage. <br />When the time came around to hunker down and read the book, i was pleasantly surprised. It was definately not the worst book in the world. As others have said the writing was poor, and one line in the book prompted me to read it aloud to the people in the room. <br />Luke looked in the mirror, and with a voice trembling with terror said \\"WHO AM I?\\"<br />I wrote a story like that when I was in grade six. However, things do pick up speed and get more interesting. All you have to do is ignore the clunky dialogue, and let your mind take some inspired leeps of faith. <br />I really wanted to hate this book, but I really couldn't. The reason why is that it was exactly what I thought it would be. A fast, pulpy, silly, piece of fluffly, literary escapism. If I had wanted to read a book because of the prose of the author, and the beauty of language, I would have. <br />Read it. But know what you are getting into. It won't change your life, but it will make the line at the bank move a heck of  lot faster.
B00004TH83|5.0|I found out about Lara Fabian by being a Josh Groban fan.  I listened to their duet on the AI soundtrack and thought it was great.  I recently heard Josh Groban perform Lara's song &quot;Broken Vow&quot; at his PBS taping (which will air in November).  I instantly went and ordered her cd.<br />She has a wonderful voice. I am going to enjoy her music!
B000002WYT|5.0|Dave Mathews Band has several incredible cds including, Under the Table and Dreaming, Before These Crowded Streets and Remember Two Things.  Crash, however, is the best Dave Mathews Band cd.  The cd contains many awsome tracks including:  Two-Step, #41, Tripping Billies, Say Goodbye, and Crash into Me.  There are no bad songs, and you can play the cd all the way through without skipping any songs.  If you like any other DMB cds, or other jam bands, then this is an excellent cd for you.
B000000WFF|5.0|Soon after the release of this album, Geri parted ways with the group...but I didn't care, because she was my least favorite girl, anyway! In fact, she barely sang at all...but whatever. This album, I think, was really great. The girls matured this time around, even though they were still having fun and the music was still great.
B00005JKPF|3.0|I didn't like the first x-men that much cause it didn't have a lot of action, i don't know how this one's gonna be but the first one was dissapointing. i thought x-men was gonna be one of the best comic book movies but i was wrong,i was into the x men comic books when i was younger but this sequel has got to be better than the first weak one, i thought spider-man was better than x men cause it had a lot of action and x men didn't have any barely.Marvel is huge now since they're coming out with moves next year like daredevil, x men 2 and the hulk, you know what they should make a punisher movie, now that ill pay to see there! punisher's da man.
B000000WCA|5.0|I'm not a closet Spice Girls fan. In fact, I'm proud of it! This was the first album and a great introduction to the Spice Girls. I'll admit, sometimes it gets a little corny with all their references to friendships...but why shouldn't they write their music about it, if that's the way they really were? This CD cheers me up whenever I'm done, all the songs are wonderfully mixed and the lyrics are smashing as an early effort! I really enjoy this debut album.
0393038912|4.0|Professor Diamond provides a compelling theory for the differences in civilizations and development among different races, linking a wide range of factors that have not generally been considered as a part of one holistic historical record. This book is an enthralling read for the evolutionary biologist, anthropologist, social scientist and layman alike. <BR>GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL is a convincing discussion about the plausibility of arguments that centre around the challenging question of why population groups on different continents experienced widely divergent paths of development. Professor Jared Diamond, comes across as a firm believer in the theory of environmental determinism, presenting elegant arguments consistent with evidence provided from a wide range of disciplines, even as he skillfully evades the question of genetic diversity, including differentiated intelligence, among racial groups even though on several occasions we find Diamond subtly stating that he finds the average New Guinean more intelligent than the average Westerner. Beginning 13,000 years ago, the author illuminated the conditions or circumstances that may have facilitated development for some groups and inhibited the rise of others. Diamond argues that food production and domestication of wild species is of paramount importance in determining variable rates of development for different societies. Jared Diamond plays skillfully with the evidence at hand to present convincing arguments of how the spread of  infectious diseases have decimated local communities and helped in the establishment of new societies, how the east/west orientation of continents proved to be conducive for transmigration of people, products, and technologies and how food production led to the growth of a predominantly hierarchical present day societies.<BR>On the whole, it proves to be an illuminating piece of work on the rise and fall of civilizations and societies from several interesting perspectives. Guns, germs andsteel is a book bound to appeal to a wide audience.
0316666343|5.0|It took me just two days to read \\"the Lovely Bones\\". What an interesting concept . The story unravels from the victim's point of view. At times chilling and other times compassionate and even comical. It becomes easy to relate to Susie's grieving family and friends to understand their diverse reactions and mechanisms of coping after her death. A very unusual novel without the expected  contrived ending. Alice Seckold leaves the reader satisfied with her eventual conclusion even though everything is not necessarily rounded off and tidied away.
B000068IEU|5.0|First of all this is a good movie by Wes Craven.  This was <BR>his first movie.  Anyway all you need to do is go on to the documentary \\"Forbidden Footage\\" while Wes is talking it goes into<BR>that seen and you see a lot more than you do on the movie.  So this DVD is basically uncut but to get a pinch more go on to \\"Forbidden Footage\\".  Most people should know this but if you don't than know you know.  Just so you know the VHS IS cut and the DVD is pretty much uncut...
B00005B36H|5.0|I am a simple man, who enjoys complex things.  I enjoy Tool for knowing they are a very complex band, but not necessarily always knowing what they are standing for.  I think the music itself is always above par.  But I think the main reason I think I enjoy this band is because of Maynard's vocals.  Not necessarily the lyrics, but the way the man presents his skills.  For example on this album:  I enjoy the 20 second scream that he performs near the end of the grudge.  I also enjoy, what I like to call a &quot;rap&quot; that comes near the end of the title track (the spot that begins with &quot;with my feet upon the ground...&quot;).  Those are just examples from this album (coincidentally my favorite two tracks).  But his skill would not come out feeling like this if it wasn't for the accompanying music that goes with it.  I don't think I have anything else to say other than: GET THIS ALBUM.

0316920045|5.0|I love books whose authors play with the experience of reading, teasing the reader by witholding and releasing information at just the right moment.  In this category I place authors like Nabokov with his unreliable first-person narrators, Rushdie with his swirling, poetic prose, Joyce with his stream-of-consciousness, nonsensical word play, and now David Foster Wallace.<br />Reading _Infinite Jest_ is a wonderfully disorienting experience from beginning (where the temporal relationships between the events being described are left totally unclear) to the end (in which a sedated character relates events witnessed through a heavily drugged haze).  But the events and characters are so quirky, so imaginative, and so 3-dimensional that none of it matters.  It's as if this extremely complex, near-future, dystopian world exists fully-formed in Wallace's head and he reveals it, bit-by-bit, to the reader, not in chronological or thematic order but as necessary or convenient.  Almost never (except occasionally in the copious and vitally important footnotes) does he resort to bald-faced exposition.  Instead, important background is constantly revealed or implied by the events of the novel.<br />It should be said that if you are the sort of reader who likes fast-paced plots with clear, clever resolutions leaving few loose ends, you will hate this book.  Although a huge number of events take place, this is not a plot-centered novel.  Instead, it's more like an extended visit to a foreign (and yet eerily familiar) country to take an extensive but not always coherent guided tour.<br />And yet the world (with its Subsidized Time, experialism, and Quebecois secessionist politics) and the characters (rising junior tennis players, recovering (and not-so-recovering) substance abusers, and Wheelchair Assassins) are so engaging that I was perfectly content for 1000 pages to be fed drips and drabs and left to my own devices to piece together what I could.<br />It is entirely appropriate that I was unable to put down and sorry to finish this novel that deals with all sorts of addictions and whose title refers to a film so fulfilling and entertaining that those who watch it are unable to do anything but continue to watch it over and over and over...and as soon as I finished _Infinite Jest_ I found myself wanting to go back to the beginning and start again.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink's first album went unnoticed to me. it was th height of the teen pop movement in pop and I wasn't going to give someone named pink the time of day. <BR>One day, I went in to a bar and i heard them blastin &quot; Don't let me Get Me&quot; and &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;. The voice drew me in. She sounded like an angry Annie Lennox singing ballsy lyrics. There was no evidence of any teen pop her. This CD is her first step yto becoming a full fledged rocker. I bought the CD the next day and I haven't regretted it since. Sure the lyrics seem child like even diaristic, but give the girl a break, she's 22 and finind her voice. There hasn't been a CD with this much vivaciousness, energy, attitude and cool since the like of No Doubts &quot; Tragic Kingdom, Cyndi Laupers &quot;She's so Unusual&quot; or Pat Benatars &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;<BR>Get This CD and You won't be disappointed.
B000069HK2|5.0|Very rarely do I buy a CD without hearing at least one song off of it. Luckily in the past I have avoided getting burned by it (Snot's 'Get Some' being a prime example of taking a chance and being rewarded). So at the urging of at least a half dozen people insisting I check this out, I sucked it up, bought this CD, popped it in and got a big grin on my face. Wow. This CD is just plain stunning. I have no idea where these guys came from, but they certainly have their style pinned down. These guys know what they're doing. The songs on here are moderately heavy, but have sort of a pop feel to them. You'll find yourself singing along to a lot of this CD. Their lead vocalist, Bert McCracken (nice name, not) has a really great voice. Listen to the song 'Poetic Tragedy' and you will see the range he has and just how outstanding he is. I bought this CD about a month ago and the only problem I have with it is that it keeps getting stuck in my CD player, I never want to take it out! Definetly a CD where you don't have to skip any tracks. Favorite songs: \\"Taste of Ink,\\" \\"Maybe Memories,\\" \\"Poetic Tragedy,\\" \\"Buried Myself Alive\\" and \\"Greener With the Scenery.\\" I seriously recommend you go pick up this CD right now. I have an extremely hard time imagining anyone being disappointed in this. These guys are going places.
0767817486|1.0|Although I believe that Alan Parker is an excellent and skilful movie director, this film<BR>is a mixture of unbelievable racist plot and full of blasphemy to the targeted Turkish people, therefore this movie is a shame in Parker's successful cinematography,and also for Oliver Stone(script).<BR>There is no good Turkish people in the film(???)<BR>and imaginary middle age (??) atmosphere of prison is set in a 1970's Turkey.<br />And also the movie's protagonist blasphemes in 3/4 of the film to all the turkish people using exactly \\"I...all your mothers, all your daughters ,you are all bla bla bla..\\"<br />I've saw an interview in a magazine of the real protagonist of the real case and he was rejecting this film and was saying that \\"it is not my story\\".<br />We know that The Greek Government (longstanding historical rivals ) of Turkish people financed this film ,and the movie has been filmed in Greece.(And also all the Turkish characters in the movie were dubbed by greek people, they all talk turkish like in a comedy as a greek person who live in Turkey)..<br />When you watch this movie you see why the Greeks financed this film,and used it to their benefit, without thinking whatever it was the results. Insulting and slandering a nation,and all its citizens.<br />I live in Switzerland and have a lot of Turkish friends,and I know this unbelievable racist film and its evil goal touched all the turkish people very deeply.Although I am against all the brute force practice in every nation of the world, I dont think this movie has an objective about this case,but have an another..<br />The Turks ask sometimes to you as \\" with your behaviour -Do you want to get some grape or your reel objective is to beat the vineyard keeper??<br />When you watch this scandalous racist film, you will see very clearly, that Alan Parker,Oliver Stone and all other Greek financiers wanted not to form a real movie, or a work of art, but all they wanted was to BEAT the Turks...

B00004URWV|5.0|For fan's of Jean Michel Jarre, Jean Jacque Perrey, Space Art, Tangerine Dream, Pete Barden, and others of such, I highly recommend Space &quot;Magic Fly&quot;, and all of there other albums. This is early electronic music from France, from the same time Jean Michel Jarre came about. Well, Jarre came about in the late 60s, but if we're talking about Oxygene then 1976, a year before this album, Magic Fly.<br />Once again this is an excellent piece of work, very relaxing with some pretty original melodies that are very nice.<br />enjoy!

B00006690F|5.0|In case you didn't notice, the Marshall Mathers LP was VERY different from the Slim Shady LP. SSLP was a comical album, with lots of joking around, funny stories, and huge exaggerations... the only serious song on it was Rock Bottom. The Marshall Mathers LP, while still having some comical tracks (Kill You, The Real Slim Shady, Criminal...), was a much more serious album (Stan, The Way I am...). This trend continues with Eminem's third commerical solo album, The Eminem Show. While many of the fans of the Slim Shady LP are disappointed, this makes for an extremely solid album... so solid in fact, that I would rate it in the top five rap albums of all time.<br />Many people have complained that there are no standout tracks on this album, like Stan from MMLP. This is because the overall quality of the album is so high, that the best songs ('Till I Collapse, Soldier, Cleanin' Out My Closet) don't stand out all that much. While 'Till I Collapse is the best song on the CD (and possibly one of the best rap songs ever created... I'm hardpressed to think of a better one), the number two spot could be shared by three different songs; Soldier, White America, and Cleanin' Out My Closet. Soldier is a fast, angry song, reminescent of 2pac's work. White America is a political song, with amazing flow and meaningful lyrics. Cleanin' Out My Closet is slow, well thought out, and painful to listen to because of how horrible some of the things he describes are. <br />Almost all of the rest of the songs on The Eminem Show are extremely high quality as well. Square Dance, Sayin' Goodbye To Hollywood, Superman, When The Music Stops, and My Dad's Gone Crazy are all amazing songs, all of which would be considered the best song on any above average rap CD. <br />Eminem also includes a few poppy songs (Without Me, Business) to keep him on MTV and keep the money rolling in. While not bad songs (some of the best stuff you'll see on MTV), they seem a little out of place on this CD... it's obvioushe included them just to appeal to the mainstream crowd (nothing wrong with that... everyone needs money).<br />The only songs this CD could've lived without are Drips and Say What You Say. Drips, while sending a good message (don't have unsafe sex), garbles it with pointless vulgarity. The song would be better with more substance and less shock tactics (do we really need to hear feminine fluids compared with sour cream dip?). Also, Say What You Say seems thrown together at the last minute (both the beat and the lyrics), not living up to the extremely high quality of the rest of the album).<br />One last note: Hailie's Song. Eminem's singing debut. I've heard mixed responses on this one. I'll put it straight. While Eminem is not a horrible singer (he sings better than most men I know), he is DEFINITELY not professional level. If you are looking for pure listening value, the singing verses on this song will not satisfy... however, the EMOTIONAL value of this song is amazing. The fact that he would put a song where he sings (and, as he states in the song, knows that he can't do it very well) on a commercial album just for his daughter shows just how much love he has for her. Sometimes, the emotional value is enough to make it a great song. I personally love this song, and would put it in the top five songs on the album (which is saying a LOT on this album). However, because the song is so dependant on emotional value (which a lot of people don't recognize), I won't even put it on the list, because 90% of people will be angry about it's placement.<br />As I stated earlier, this CD is an amazingly solid CD (eleven out of the fifteen songs on it would be considered AT LEAST extremely good by an average, unbiased rap fan). Couple that with the fact that the very top songs on it are some of the best rap songs ever created, and you have one of the top five rap CDs of all time, and DEFINITELY the best since Biggie's death (I'm not saying that any of Biggie's CDs were the best, I'm just saying that the CDs that have come out since are of lower quality).

6301969294|2.0|And then some... There doesn't seem to be one line in this film (or in the book) that doesn't telegraph Rand's \\"philosophy\\" like a punch to the proboscis. The pompous & silly propagandizing is worse than Riefenstahl's films for Hitler. But it was prescient in one very key sense. It anticipated the strong need of today's viewing & reading public for easy-to-understand formulas that substitute for real thinking (& \\"self\\" understanding). Good cinematography though. Vidor always did have a great feel for the WPA look.
B00005QDW1|3.0|Rock Steady is a decent recording effort and features a couple of very well-written songs.  Alot of the material is forgettable, however, though it tends to be better than the melodramatic &quot;Return of Saturn&quot;.<br />My personal favorite on the disc would be track 9, &quot;Running&quot;.  It is subdued, carefully-chorded, and Gwen Stefani manages to inject the lyric with sweetness.  Radio hits &quot;Hella Good&quot; and &quot;Hey Baby&quot; are decent tracks as well, although they fall more into the category of mindless party music (not necessarily a bad thing).<br />I continue to buy and enjoy No Doubt's work, and Rock Steady should appeal to a broad range of listeners.

0316666343|3.0|I've only read the first couple of chapters, as I had heard so much about the book and wanted an idea of if I would enjoy it before I bought it.  So far, I think the descriptions and writing are beautiful.<br />I don't think it's unrealistic that people would act inconsistently, before or after the murder.  They're supposed to be people, not perfectly logical robots.  As to the argument about Susie wearing the childish hat her mother gave her being in conflict with her sophistication, that review wasn't paying attention.  First of all, she says she doesn't wear the hat (it's in her pocket), even though it's cold, because it is too immature for her.  Also, she contrasts her knowledgeable viewpoint from heaven with how naive she was before her murder.<br />I can't speak for the rest of the book, but I thought those complaints were completely off base.  Please keep in mind that reviews are not supposed to be synopses of the plot.  Some of us might still want to read the book, after reading all the reviews.
0385486804|4.0|I read the book, \\"Into the Wild,\\" by Jon Krauker.  This book tells the mystery story of a man Christopher Johnson McCandless.  This man gave all his money away and left most of his possessions behind.  He does not tell his family anything and the next thing they knew Christopher was dead in Alaska.  This story is an unraveling mystery about what happened to Christopher the four months before his death while he was on the road.  But this is also a mystery of why a man, with everything going his way, would drop everything, disappear, and keep his family worrying about where he went off to.  <BR> What was so touching about this book was how Christopher touched many people's lives.  For example, Christopher gets help from a man, Ronald Franz, (not his real name.)  Ron gives him rides, food, and clothes.  They also spent a lot of together.  Ronald gets very attached to Christopher, so when Christopher left, Ronald Franz was heart broken.  \\"Astoundingly, the eighty-one-year-old man took the brash twenty-four-year-old vagabond's advice to heart.  Franz placed his furniture and most of his other possessions in a storage locker, bought a GMC Duravan, and outfitted it with bunks and camping gear.  Then he moved out if his apartment and set up camp on the bajada.\\"  This is just one of the people's lives Christopher touched.  The way he affected people is heat warming.  There was hardly nothing bad sad about Christopher.  <BR> I was glued to this book.  It is not just a touching story or mystery.  It is an adventure that makes the reader think about life and what is worth living for.  The author, Jon Krakauer, did fantastic job getting all this information about Christopher McCandless, who never stayed in one spot.  Christopher was always moving.  Jon Krakauer's great imagery and writing makes the reader feel like they are in the book, retracing the steps of Christopher McCandless.  \\"On the northern margin of the Alaska Range, just before the hulking ramparts of Mt. McKinley and its satellites surrender to the low Kantishna plain, a series of lesser ridges, known as the Outer Range, sprawls across the flats like a rumpled blanket on an unmade bed.  Between the flinty crests of the outermost escarpments of the Outer Range runs an east-west trough, maybe five miles across, carpeted in a boggy amalgam of muskeg, alder thickets, and veins of scrawny spruce.  Meandering through the tangled, rolling bottomland is the Stempede Trail, the route Chris McCandless followed into the wilderness. <BR> This tragic story of a man's escape is full of excitement and suspense.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to sit down and dive into the great detective work of Jon Krakauer.

0553275976|5.0|In retrospect, there is no better snapshot of New York City during the 1980's than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES.  This novel completely captures the energy, and even the euphoria, which crept into city life during a decade that now seems far removed.<br />BONFIRE is an engrossing novel, interweaving all of the many aspects of city life, from the self-indulgences of the newly (very) rich to the struggles of the ghetto poor.  Much like that proverbial first potato chip, once a reader gets a taste of this book, it is hard to stop reading until the final resolution.  Wolfe writes a detailed and informative story in his typical lively style.<br />Anyone who wants to remember New York City during the overheated 80's will find THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES to be a clear snapshot of that time and that place.

0060920386|5.0|BARBARIANS AT THE GATE reads like a work of fiction.  To compare this book to fiction is quite a compliment to its authors.  Just as easily, they could have been reported this story as a dry and dreary episode in the chronicle of this nation's business conglomerates.<br />Instead, they focus on the very real players in these dealings, a group of people who were living large at the end of the 1980's.  This was a decade of ostentatious successes and conspicuous consumption, so these people and their lifestyles make wonderful copy.  Along the way, the authors use their stories to flesh out the cut-and-dried business machinations which made them rich and famous.<br />BARBARIANS AT THE GATE is a lively account of a very specific moment in the financial history of our nation.

0316666343|5.0|In The Lovely Bones, Alice Sebold transform into a world of a family dealing with incredible grief and how they try to go on with life. Alice also shows us in her wonderful book, the pains of growing up that most adults seem to forget.  She gives us beautiful details without making the book seem long and tedious.  Susie Salmon is a thirteen-year old girl who has been murdered and is in already in heaven. She watches from heaven, her loved ones back on earth.  Everything she wants always appears in her heaven except what she really wants, to be back with people on Earth.  Susie sees how her family is changing. Her sister growing up without her and enjoying all the things she wishes she could, first kiss and a forever love.  She sees her little brother try to understand what really happened to his sister. She watches as her parents struggle to live their day to day life while dealing with their immense grief.  In the end of the book, a miracle takes place that makes the readers sit back and really reflect on life. Sometimes we forget how truly lucky we are just to be alive but this story reminds us. It gives us hope that there really are miracles and that there really is such thing as love in the world. This story gives out a radiating light of optimism that together, we can all get through anything together.  <BR> When my friend first recommended that I read this book, I thought it would be just another sappy book with whiny characters and clich lines. But it was not. This book is so remarkable because it manages to capture the real feeling of its characters. The author does not just scratch the surface but goes deep inside the characters personality and emotions.  Susie is portrayed perfectly as a girl with a deep longing to be back with the people she loves. She loses herself in past memories from when she was alive and then craftily goes into the present time.  This book goes makes its readers go through all the emotions, laughter, sadness, understanding, and pain.  This is a book where at the end, you feel like you are a part of the family.  The Salmon family becomes a part of you and you can not wait to turn the page to see what happens next. When you finished reading, you will want to keep it on your bookshelf as a reminder your journey into the middle of a strong family and their experiences.
B000002J09|5.0|With enough hits to be some bands &quot;greatest Hits&quot; album, Led Zepplin IV is an all time classic for the classic rocker. With songs like Black Dog, Rock and Roll, Misty Mountian Hop, and last but certianly not least, Stairway to heaven, in my opinon one of the best songs Zepplin has ever produced. The advanced guitar riff of Black dog is very impressive, and it is obvious that this was John Bonham's finest album. Songs like Goin' to California is a good more mellow folk song, very nice. Robert Plant's voice is a work of art in these songs more so than his other recordings. Buy this album, even if you are not a follower of Led Zepplin, you will not be disapointed.
B0000214F3|5.0|Long, but worth watching unfold.  I truly enjoyed it, and I hope you will too.  Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins both bring out the best in each other; Hopkins has a tendency to chew the scenery sometimes when the drama is high and Brad Pitt sometimes retreats behind his on-screen persona [sort of scruffy but charming, and a little vacant] if not challenged in his roles.  However, neither one of them do this in this film.  Hopkins shows great heart and humanity in a performance that is by turns subtle and stunning in its intensity.  Pitt underplays everything except the first scenes in the cafe.  This is Pitt as his most charming and engaging, which is saying a great deal.  The latter scenes, where Death takes over Pitt's character's body, are all the more amazing because they are so subdued.  Death, apparently, is very fond of peanut butter and [as one might expect] one glimpses an exceedingly dry, even arid, sense of humor.  Pitt's interpretation of Mr. D. rises to greatness because of the blend of both fulfilled expectations of what Death would be like personified and some surprising twists to the way he behaves.  The only point which seems to be a little out of character for Death is when he announces his love for Hopkins' daughter and his intent to take her with him when he goes.  I can see where it would be very hard for an actor to make this work, as we know that Death cannot love, for Death is the ultimate Detachment.  Love is about attaching one's life and soul to that of another.  The body that he occupies can experience heterosexual carnal desire, but Death can't really love someone.  The best he can hope for is a moment of the touching of the soul of the one that he loves, before he releases her to the Next Level. Pitt handles the part when he lets the girl know who he really is magnificently, but maybe what could have been done was to play the scene where he confesses his love as an expression of a profound wish that he *could* love someone so worthy of it.<br />But who am I to give acting advice?  I hope you enjoy this film, as it is a real pleasure to watch such wonderful actors work under a great director, with a grand story.

His guitar playing is, as always, stellar... his band is tight and does an excellent job at bringing MK's ideas to life. If you like MK and his previous work you will enjoy this new record. He's always been a great story-telling songwriter as well as one of the very finest guitarists we've ever had. He continues to find new ways to twist a lyric into thought-provoking and/or funny stories <br />(even - arguably - one of the best shoe spots ever) and he bears that out with big-time style on The Ragpicker's Dream.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Loved the music in the movie -- thought I'd by the CD. Mistake! Some of the best songs from the movie are missing...like &quot;Spectacular Spectacular&quot; and &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and more. Plus there are some lousy songs that weren't even in the move. I actually thought it was a mistake and that I ordered the wrong thing!  Unfortunately not. I feel cheated!

B000067FP7|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films.  I grew up watching this and it scared me and made me laugh at the same time.  i just picked up the special edition dvd. Anyway the Party at Dorry's scene with the gremlins cracks me up every time i watch it.  The flashdancing gremlin and the cocktail waiter gremlin who spins on the bar (it lasts for bout a 1/2 a second) kills me every time.  The director Joe Dante is a genius of the absurd.  I just wish most of his movies didn't bomb at the box office (American movie going tastes <are bad> if you ask me), so we could have seen more brilliance (Pick up Gremlins 2, which pretty much takes the Dorry's bar scene and extends it for the last 2/3rds of the movie.  A bit much and part 2 has less scares and is less schizo in tone than the orignal.  Still a must see.
B000001F76|5.0|Hank Williams is a true master of words. As one reviewer previously mentioned, no lyricist or poet ever used such simple English to express such complicated feelings. On top of Hank's lyrical brilliance, he was a vocal genius. In the same way that Muddy Waters almost &quot;created&quot; the intonations in the vocals of all modern blues singers, Hank &quot;created&quot; the intonations and pauses in the vocals of all modern country singers. Both men were masters of vocal subtlety.<BR>    As for these two cd's, they are flawless. Sure, maybe your favorite Hank Williams song is missing, and there is one you're not crazy about in this collection. However, this is as perfect as a Hank cd can be. Hank Williams is probably one of the 10 greatest artists in the history of music; buy this cd now!
0375707972|4.0|I am about half way through The Reader (enjoying it so far) and was curious what other's had to say. Well the reader who titled his/her review &quot;A bitter portrayal of a young man's bliss and its aftermath&quot; just gave away the rest of the book for me! A review is not a blow-by-blow synopsis of the book, especially not on an e-commerce site intent on selling readers the book. I am so disappointed that I read this review, and I'm nowhere near as excited about going home and finishing the book now.
1587990717|5.0|The book's weaknesses lies in the fact that 1) it is not a textbook, 2) it is not linear (more of a meditation than a treatise), 3) it is personal. Its strength also lie in that. It is entertaining and personal, and certainly not dry at all for it. Veryb unusual for such a topic usually treated by nerdy electrical engineers .<BR>It can rub some people the wrong way (the author trashes those he believes take themselves seriously but this includes himself!).<BR>At any rate Nassim says that he writes principally to entertain himself. He certainly entertained me.
0446608955|2.0|Ok,the book is alright. But the Movie is way better,I fell in love with the characters in the movie but I couldn't get into the book. It was good but the movie is one of my very favorites and the book didn't even come close.
0312243022|2.0|The novel, The Hours, by Michael Cunningham, opens up with an idea of Virginia Woolf's last few days before she commits suicide.  It then continues on with two stories about modern American women. All three stories take place in different settings. The first story is about a woman named Virginia Woolf. Her narrative has taken place in the early 1920s, in the middle of the war. The second story is about a woman named Laura Brown, which has taken place in the 1940s. She is in her mid thirties, is married has a son, and lives in a suburban part of Los Angeles. Finally the last story is about a woman named Clarissa Vaughn. She is in her early fifties and has a long time friend named Richard who is a prominent write who is dying of the fatal illness AIDS. Also, she is a book editor who lives in the present day. The book opens up with an idea of Virginia Woolf's last few days before she commits suicide.<BR>For me the book was, to some degree, difficult for me to understand due to extent of deep feelings that were expressed within the three stories that were collaborated. After reading page after page of everyone's feelings and deep thoughts it got really annoying that it couldn't be possessed physically within the character. There was also very little dialog, which didn't urge me to fully enjoy the book. I furthermore wanted the feelings and deep thoughts to be brought out by the character through their speech. I've been recommended to reading Virginia Woolf's novel Mrs. Dalloway, which I think would've helped me understand the book a little more. Though I didn't particularly like the book altogether what I did like was how Cunningham expressed his words. They flowed as perfect as a river because it was so beautifully written. Overall I wouldn't recommend this book unless you were really into poetry and material with deep powerful meanings.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|Even if you weren't that impressed with this movie, this DVD is so worth buying! The extra features are really impressive. In addition to an attractive package with a nice booklet and vintage postcards, the DVDs themselves are full of commentaries, documentaries, and other goodies, giving a lot of insight into what the movie makers had in mind. The movie itself I give 5 stars for looks and 1 star for plot and character development. (A 2-dimensional love story somewhat trivializes an important historical event.) But, boy does it look good! If you are a film buff, I think you'd find the extras on the DVD outweigh the lackluster movie itself.
B0000542D2|5.0|This is a great movie.  A piece of history that everyone remotely connected to or interested in western culture should see.  The great Roger Ebert said it best, &quot;One of the great life-affirming landmarks of the movies&quot;.  I still love the scene where Paul's grandfather pops up during &quot;She Loves You&quot;- a really pure and funny scene.<br />That said the criticisms about the sound quality are unfortunately true.  I was expecting a lot more oomph when I heard the opening 12 string Rickenbacher chime for the title song.  Now I want to find the original dvd release that everyone is speaking of so fondly here.  <br />There are also some bad copies out there.  I bought mine right away and had to return and replace it because of some digital freeze frame gobbledegook.  The second copy worked fine.  But I know of one other person here in Boston who had the same problem.<br />Also what the hell is up with the packaging?  This is A Hard Days Night for God's sake.  Miramax made it look like those cheesey Millenium Collection cd's.  I didn't recognize it at all in the store.<br />Even still I will play it again, and again, and again.  Just like I did in 1985 when I first saw it on videotape.  This time playing along on my Rickenbacher and 6 string acoustic... pretending to be a Beatle in my living room.
B00006J9OT|5.0|Imagine the technical piano styling of Andre Previn, the hard driving beat of Ramsey Lewis, and the jazz comprehension of Oscar Peterson, joined in one set of hands.  Then, imagine the throaty sexuality of Chris Connor, the soul of Billie Holiday,and the styling genius of Ella Fitzgerald pulled together into one voice.  Put the two together, and you have Diana Krall - at her best ever in this live recording.  The DVD blew me away.  Then, I heard the CD and picked up on the tremendous talent that Ms. Krall and her combo present.  It's great to watch (even with the body english and facial throes of her guest guitarist), but there is a level of professionalism that gets lost behind the visual splendor and that manefests itself through the audio performance.  The excitement that was missing in \\"The Look of Love\\" is back.  Jazz Lives!!
B000068FWC|5.0|Get this album no matter what.  I have to laugh at Rolling Stone or anyone else who doesn't have this album on their list of the 10 best albums of all time.  There are 10 songs on the album. At least 8 of them are masterpieces.  The Logical Song and Goodbye Stranger are perhaps the most famous but Take The Long Way Home, Breakfast In America, Oh Darling, Lord Is It Mine, Child of Vision and Gone Hollywood are all also outstanding.  The other two are also great just a bit more dark.  ...  Get it. You will love it.  I guarantee it.
B000066NW0|4.0|This album is a slice of music heaven. Though it does have some low points, like Too Much To Ask the rest makes up a great album. Sk8r Boi is a bouncy song about not judging people and the single Complicated makes good listening. Unwanted is a powerful song which I identify with totally. Anything But Ordinary is my anthem and I just love it. I gave it 4 stars because its not quite perfect but its so close!
B00003CXTG|3.0|In short, the movie is a rich man's two hour soap opera, complete with best friends falling in love with the same girl.<br />The DVD does include more fight footage which is an improvement. Still, it is not enough to put the movie on the top of any respectable list.<br />Buy it if you just want to add it to an already extensive collection, otherwise, use your money on a better movie.
B00006AFUR|5.0|5 stars is simply not enough.  This album is as close to the perfect record as i think we can hope to achieve.  From start to finish, every second is powerful and completely breathtaking.  An 11 track masterpiece that will cement these young men into the history books of rock and roll forever.<br />Vocally, Jared Leto is virtually beyond compare.  He has raised the bar for all rock singers by a significant margin and will likely one day find himself held in the same revere as such vocal gods as Bono and Jeff Buckley.  <br />The instrumentation on the record is befitting of such an inspiring vocal talent.  The percussion is excellent, blending industrial, progressive and alternative beats into a thundering roar.  The guitar work is phenomenal and the synth effects are understated, adding tremendously to the songs without overtaking them.  <br />To put it simply, 30 seconds to mars has not only released the best album of 2002, but quite possibly the last decade.   Buy it.  now.
B00005JKED|5.0|The story of a young, \\"green\\" narcotics officer and a corrupt veteran officer, Training Day is definitely a movie to talk about.<br />Ethan Hawke plays a young cop during his first day on the LAPD narcotics squad. He is to receive his training from Denzel Washington, the Sr. Officer in the same group. During his training, Washington challenges Hawke to cross the line between cop and criminal.<br />Provoking ideas throughout the movie, like \\"what would you do if your life counted on it?\\" However the last 30 seconds are entirely predictable. Still, very much worth buying!
B00005LMBK|5.0|The gorillaz have created a masterpiece in one attempt.  They songs are beautifully constructed, layered to all hell, completely original, and have a sense of cohesion (strange when you think of how many styles this album exhibits).  These are all traits you would usually expect from a band that's been around for years.  But the album, despite it's electronic palate of sounds, is incredibly raw, the best part of a normal debut album.<BR>  The controlled genious, playfullness, and raw studio sound bring to mind Odelay, Outkast, the Pixies, the Presidents (RIP), and even Exile on Main Street(!).  It actually is incredibly similar to Odelay.  If you're one of those people that has memorized every sound on Odelay, I command you to purchase the Gorillaz.  You'll thank me later.<BR>  The next amazing thing about this album is its length.  It has seventeen tracks, and maybe three weak ones.  It seems like a combined cd, with an lp and an ep, but it's just one lp.  Believe me, you WILL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH WITH THIS ALBUM.<BR>  There are weaknesses, though.  The songs, or at least some of them, could use some conciseness.  Rock the House, Sound Check, and Slow Country (the best song on the album) go on forever.  Which is a shame because songs like 5/4 (yes, it's named after the time signiture, which is actually 5/4 over 2/4), Clint Eastwood, 19-2000, and Re-Hash are perfectly paced, disjointed pop songs made in another universe.  The other songs just sound rushed.  Then there's the weak tracks that are a result of packing too much material into the album.  It looses steam after Double Bass as far as cohesion goes, and there's a drop in song quality after Latin Simone (except for Slow Country).<BR>  But don't let the cartoon characters scare you away from a VERY seriously good album.  Pretend they aren't there, if you must.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' In The Rain is a landmark musical.  Gene Kelly was riding high after his An American In Paris had just won the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and he and director Stanley Donan hit all the right notes.  The film's plot revolves around the difficult transition the film industry had moving from silent films to talkies.  Mr. Kelly is Don Lockwood who a dashing leading man who has become a star starring alongside the gorgeous Lina Lamont.  On the silent screen Lina knows how to strike all the right poses, but when she is making her first talkie, it is discovered that she has a shrill, screechy voice akin to nails on a blackboard.  Lina is played brilliantly by Jean Hagen who was the only cast member to score an Academy Award nomination (in the Best Supporting Actress category).  Donald O'Conner plays Don's best friend Cosmo and Debbie Reynolds plays his love interest Kathy who in the end voices Lina's parts and is revealed as the true star of the film. The movie's real highlights are the songs.  \\"Make `Em Laugh\\", \\"Broadway Melody\\" which features the sultry Cyd Charrise, the brilliant \\"Good Morning\\" and of the title track which is one of the most famous and indelible screen images of all time with Mr. Kelly putting on the dance number of his career.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|At the time of Unforgiven's release in 1992, Clint Eastwood was a movie icon with most of his most memorable films being westerns.  This film though would become his most acclaimed and honored movie.  It is a classic western tale of a man with a terrible past who struggles for redemption.  Mr. Eastwood plays William Munny who was one the most ruthless and cold-blooded killers of his day.  As the film opens, he is now just a lowly hog farmer who is widowed with two young children he can barely afford to feed and care for.  Along comes a young stranger known only as the Schofield Kid (played by Jaimz Woolvert) who propositions Munny to join him on a mission to avenge a prostitute who was beaten by some men.  Munny reluctantly agrees and the journey back into his former life is a revealing and sobering experience.  Along the way they join up with an old cohort of Munny's Ned Logan played by Morgan Freeman and a strange bounty hunter English Bob played by Richard Harris.  Gene Hackman is brilliant as a sadistic sheriff Little Bob with whom Munny has a final showdown that strikes at the heart of the film.  It reveals the impact that a violent life has on a person's conscience and soul.  The film won the 1992 Oscar for best film, best director for Mr. Eastwood (who won his second Oscar of the year as producer of the film) and Mr. Hackman won his second Oscar as best supporting actor twenty-one years after his best actor Oscar for the French Connection.
B0000542D2|5.0|A Hard Days Night was produced to capitalize on the Beatlemania craze that was sweeping across England and America in 1964.  The fact that a musical act was releasing a movie to piggyback on their success on the record charts was not a new idea.  It had been done by Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, Pat Boone and of course Frank Sinatra.  But was new was the approach.  Instead of creating characters for the group to act as in some contrived plot that allowed them to perform new songs written for the film, they acted as themselves in basically a day in the life of the Beatles.  The results were a surprise to most as the film is extremely funny, well written and well acted.  Of course, by playing themselves, the band doesn't have to assume new identities, but their quick wit and wry humor makes for some great scenes and a fun experience.  Although some of the humor is dated, the film has held quite well despite being almost forty years old.  Director Richard Lester does a superb job in capturing the madness the band was going through at the time.  The four Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr are extremely likable and funny in their own way, Mr. Lennon is sarcastic, Mr. McCartney cute and bubbly, Mr. Harrison is deadpan and wry and Mr. Starr a lovable goof.  The music is the focus of the film and the songs including \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\", \\"If I Fell\\", \\"Tell Me Why\\" and the title track are rock classic.  The extras are great and the DVD is well worth the long wait.
B000005RQT|5.0|Heavy metal doesn't get much earlier or heavier than this. \\"Child in Time\\" was even in the movie \\"Twister\\". This is Deep Purple, 1970. This was late night FM stuff back then, too bad it isn't now. Some of it sounds crazy, but it sounds like it's meant to be. The titles also sound crazy and they're meant to be too. This, like I said, is one of the earliest heavy metal albums. This is Deep Purple's heaviest. Anyone who remembers \\"Beeker Street\\" on KAAY I think will agree that they probably played songs on it from this album.
B00006F7S4|4.0|Here Beck plays his genre ping pong harking back to Mutations understated beauty.  This pseudo concept album pulls off the difficult task of representing some dreary issues, without coming off as a downer.  From the opening tune, the sweepingly beautiful Golden Age, Beck sets the tone for this modern blues epic.  Easy whimsical understating strumming lie just beneath some of the most intraspective lyrics in pop music in some time.  Beck's back and we're in a better place for it!
078322799X|5.0|Frank Bannister is a simple single man with an average life eccept for one problem. HE CAN SO GHOSTS!!!!! He even lives with some and befriends them. The biginning of this movie makes you think it's gonna be a stupid ghost/comedy movie that Michael J. Fox has wasted his time on. WELL IT'S NOT. Close to the middle of the movie is when the horror begins. In other words, All Hell Breaks Loose starting with this part of the movie. Frank notices a very creepy looking spirit flying around and killing people in his town. It seems that it reaches inside its victums and squeezes their hearts until they they stop. This creature looks just like the grim reaper, complete with cloaked body and sythe in hand. Frank attempts to stop it with the help of his ghost friends but with little affect. Frank can see who it will come after next because just before they die, he notices they have numbers carved into their foreheads. Trying to save people, however, only makes him become a suspect in this murder spree. When this evil spirit starts coming after the women he's in love with, having already lost his wife in a car crash, he takes this save the victums thing to a whole new level. He trys an out-of-body expierence to fight the evil spirit hand to hand. This was one of the great special effects scene. Another good special effects scene is when victums die and float up into the spirit world. There is a huge cloudy spiral and everything. This movie has funny parts early on but middle to end is terrifing, slasher , blood and guts horror. Michael J. Fox does a great acting job. If you barely like him at all you will love The Frighteners.
B000003S0P|5.0|In 1994 I picked up this album, deciding to give King Crimson one more try (the only other album I owned by them was Lizard). I wasn't prepared for what this album had in store.<br />To call Red a dark album is like saying The Beatles were kind of popular. Even on the hundredth listen, this album is still a very dark, ominous, powerful recording. 25 years after its release, this album still sounds fresh and timeless. The raw, dry guitar sound and the overwhelming power of the rhythm section still sounds utterly modern. To put it simply: sonically, this recording hasn't aged much at all. <br />Though the album is fairly short, it's still a riveting listen. The first three songs - Red, Fallen Angel, and One More Red Nightmare come in rapid succession, all perfect to listen to if you're trying to get pumped up for something or if you're just in a bad mood and want to listen to something sinister.<br />The quiet, lurking evil of Providence provides an interlude before Starless, one of King Crimson's greatest pieces. Starting out as a very quiet, almost mournful ballad, it quickly becomes mid-70s-Crim-trademark tension and release. <br />This is an album that everyone should hear at least once in their lifetime. It's completely powerful and I've never heard anything quite like it since.
B000063V8S|2.0|Season 4 is a terrific season for TNG however the low rating is due to manufactors problems with disk 1. I was unable to play the episodes 'Brothers' and 'Suddenly Human' on my DVD player. Both episodes were extremely jumpy. The picture was highly pixilized and the sound came out distorted. I thought it might be the DVD player so I played the disk on my DVD-ROM to see if the same thing would happen and the DVD would not play at all. I tried cleaning the disk and still had the same problems.
B00005QZ82|5.0|We've seen it before (When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless In Seattle) and since (You Have Mail), but Meg Ryan is indisputably The Right One for this cutesy-yet-not-too-slushy romantic comedy lark.<br />Aviophobic bride-to-be Kate (Ryan) is enthusiastically preparing for the lavish wedding when her fiancé flies off to Paris on a medical conference ... only to 'phone-in a few days later with the startling announcement that Kate should cease wedding arrangements forthwith as ... he has fallen in love with a Frenchwoman. Disbelievingly, Kate faces her mortal fear of flying to get to Paris and shake him out of his infatuation. On the aeroplane she sits next to petty thief Luc Teyssier (Kevin Kline - Gérard Dépardieu declined the rôle). Exchanging stereotypical national dislikes, it is hate at first sight.<br />Or is it ...? Ryan is ever-cuddly and ever-so-slightly-ditzy, whilst Kline is perfectly-accented and stubbled, oozing a pretty darn convincing Gallic charm. Kate's rebuttals by the Georges Cinq's stoic Concièrge - she puts down 100 Francs as a bribe; he simply takes it - are a treat. And so is her animated air-fighting following the theft of her luggage - \\"Oh man ... ma stuff, man ...\\" Almost as a fil rouge, Kate's wanderings through the City of Light include constantly not seeing the Eiffel Tower ... until she is on a train leaving Paris. Kate's earlier opinion of loser Luc turns via promiscuous rascal to grudging respect upon discovering that he is, in fact, a Man With A Plan, from a background in fine wine; that moment is quite poignant ... Hovering in the background is avuncular detective-sergeant Jean (Léon) Réno who is aware of Luc's family history as well as his current jewellery-smuggling, but who owes Luc a never-fully-explained life debt. It is he who actually rescues the mis-matched couple ...<br />Anybody who says \\"They don't make 'em like they used to ...\\" should swallow those ill-chosen words as the 1990s have produced endearing romantic comedies to counter the numerous over-the-top petroleum-jelly & mayhem Action Blockbusters. French Kiss may be a trifle formulaic, but its superbly-nostalgic soundtrack - Charles Trenet's rendition of Verlaine's 'Blesse Mon Coeur' is wonderfully evocative of an autumn stroll in Paris - and the fine interaction between Ryan and Kline help make this one of the more memorable and heartwarming feel-good films of the decade.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Yes, Manson himself has thanked the good religious community for making him a house hold name. The very people who claim to know that he is \\"evil\\" and have ignorantly missed his point, have helped to make him famous, oh the irony! Evil, yes if being able to think for yourself, rely on yourself, not feeling guility for having human emotions and fighting to keep your own free will in a so called \\"free\\" country is considered as such, guess I am too! Most people miss the point. The band is a criticism of the issues of religious hypocracy and conformity in America. This album is built on the concept of Manson's life experiences and how religious hypocracy formed him into this so-called antichrist. His message speaks loud to those of us who exercise free-will, we hear it. This album is his best to date, hard rocking and filled with deep and truthful meaning. Read the lyrics, as with all Manson albums. A true creative work of art.
0375823360|5.0|The typical stereotype of a work of fantasy is a good guy pitted against a bad guy in a magical battle to save the world.<BR>This is certainly NOT that.<br />These were truly some of the best books I have read.  These aren't just simple fantasy books for children or teens; these will be enjoyable and thought-provoking even to parents.  It is true to realistic events and real characteristics.  No character is purely good or evil.  The books seem so real you forget that it's fiction after a few pages.  It all seems possible.  Subtle debates about issues applicable to real life carry through the trilogy.<br />It starts with us meeting Lyra, the female character that we soon grow to care about greatly.  She lives in a world that is very similar to ours, but also different.  There are daemons, physical embodiments of our souls.  Witches, some for Lyra and some against, intelligent animals like armored bears, and more are abound.  And then, there's this all-important particle nicknamed as Dust...what exactly is it?  And all this is only in the first volume.  As Pullman tells us before the start of TGC, \\"The second begins in the universe we know, and then it and the third volume will move between the universes.\\"<br />Read it!
0767819594|5.0|Unless you are ragingly asexual, strongly against promiscuious behavior, and dislike comedy, drama and tragedy, there is a good chance that you will find something good to say about Cruel Intentions. Guys like it for the \\"scoring\\", cool cars and sometimes scantily clad cuties like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Selma Blair and Reese Witherspoon whereas girls can appreciate the tragic true love stories and of course RYAN's BUTT! I think a reason why people love it so much is that they can relate to it- everyone has wanted to be bad at one point in time but most people don't carry it out. Besides a delicious cast, great performances by Gellar and Phillipe, believable chemistry between the actors and a massive soundtrack, this story managed to make  me laugh out loud and cry in the same sitting. It has a great moral, too: what goes around comes around.

B00004RFFM|1.0|I remember when this flick was released in theaters and how I wanted to go see it so bad and never got to go. But I did rent it when it came out on home video and I'm glad I didn't go see it at the theaters. Why? Because it stunk! It was a huge disappointment. The sharks in the movie look so fake, infact, faker than the Great White shark in the movie Jaws, which was a heck of a better movie than this one. Jaws was a much better movie than this! However, gore hounds might get a kick out of it. It is definetly bloody but I could really care less. A movie needs more than just blood & guts to make it a winner. And this was not a winner. The sharks in this movie look a lot like a cartoon or something. The acting is poor. The plot is stupid. And this movie is a dud! If you want a good shark movie, then watch Jaws or something. But avoid this.
0446677450|3.0|This is a good book for everyday people like us.  The reading is very light and easy so you don't need to be a math wizard to understand it and you will read it in a flash, which is always a good thing.  You will gain some good common \\"cents\\" on what to do with your money.  The key point is to use your money to buy assets as opposed to liabilities.  An asset is something that puts money in your pocket.  A liability takes money away from your pocket.  According to the book, if you can get only this point after reading the book, you are light years ahead of everyone else.  But the book does not go into details on how you can amass these assets.  It is more a self-help book than a personal finance book.  Each chapter is very inspirational and contains stories of financial conquests by the author.  Personally, I find that to be annoying after a while because I hate people that brag.  The author claims he is not bragging but is trying to inspire you.  This is similar to someone telling you, \\"Please don't take this personally, but you are a....\\"
6304097042|4.0|Ali was one of the best fighters of all time. And this 90 minute documentary captures some of his greatest moments - the title winning victory over Liston, his captivating interviews with the press, and still photographs of his 1974 win over George Foreman. <br />This video has been eclipsed by more recent documentaries such as the the 6 video set &quot;Muhammad Ali: The Whole Story,&quot; &quot;The Fights and Times of Muhammad Ali,&quot; the ESPN Sports Century one hour documentary, and a number of others. If you have those, you don't need this. But if all you want is one 90 minute video, this will do fine.
B00005RDCA|5.0|Previous reviews have said it all so I'll just reiterate that this is one of the top 100 albums of rock history, in my book top 50.  It's a shame that &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit,&quot; as great as they are, received the most airplay because every track has something to offer; yes, this was known as psychedelic rock but Marty Balin's &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Comin' Back To Me&quot; are two beautifully quiet ballads that further showcase their unique writing and arrangements and stand the test of time. Grace Slick's voice was never better and stronger and &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; definitely shows her vocal talent and range. <br />Some may think the music sounds dated because it is very much a late '60's sound but it's so perfectly put together that to miss experiencing it would be a shame.  Jerry Garcia is noted as Musical and Spiritual Adviser in the liner notes-not sure what he did but the effects were profound.
B00005JKG5|5.0|Well, Paramount has done a better job at this one.  Compared to Grease....the Dolby 5.1 Surround of Flashdance is wonderful, with rich bass best heard during &quot;Maniac&quot; and &quot;Manhunt&quot;.  Unlike Grease I didn't here any drop outs or fades in the sound and the music certainly does surround you.  As for the picture, it has a good 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer, some scenes are fuzzy at best, but others are crystal clear.  The reason for the 3 stars for the disc. NO EXTRAS....no trailer, no commentary, no behind the scenes featurettes, not even cast bios.  Ahhh, Paramount Pictures, could we expect anything less.  I don't think so.  As for the movie....there's enough reviews here about that, except to say wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
B000002P5R|5.0|Having listened to everything else Hendrix for years, \\"First Rays...\\" just proves I can not tire of his music.  \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Ezy Rider\\" are great driving songs and just beg to be played loud, whereas \\"Angel\\" and \\"Driftin\\" are in complete contrast and moodier, much in \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" way.  Hendrix's lyrics are not complex but a little goes a long way-it almost doesn't matter what words are used because the music and his guitar virtuosity speak volumes and the lyrics are more like subliminal subtext.  <br />I am no music reviewer but I know Hendrix can still inspire me at 36 as he did when I was 13, which was nine years after his death.  \\"First Rays...\\" is one of those posthumous compilations that does justice to his legacy, which shows no sign of deteriorating.  If you own \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and \\"Are You Experienced\\" plus this one, it surely is enough to convince you how great and short-lived his genius was.  If you think that's an exagerration, listen to the best gutarists who followed him and they will all say they worshipped at the ground of Jimi.
1568496982|3.0|The problem with this book is that it's so gnomic.  That is, its compact style and size are, I suppose, purposefully wrought in this way so that we may come away asking ourselves profound questions on the meaning of a mentor/student relationship, social hierarchies, art, betrayal, pedagogy etc.  It's, you know, like the kind of thing you get from an old white-bearded yogi sitting on the top of some Himmalayan mountain: &quot;The crow flies in square circles.&quot;-Now, what's the meaning of life?<br />  The problem with this type of book is that it never takes the time (or Spark doesn't)to grab hold of your heart and mind for long enough to make you care about the deeper questions involved (and they are clearly there).  Rather, it flits around like some intriguing butterfly on a lazy afternoon and then just as quickly hovers out of sight.<br />  In other words, Spark and the book are too coy by half.  You forget about the lilting butterfly by nightfall.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first saw the episode &quot;Once More With feeling&quot; it was a rerun so I missed out on the extra 8 minutes so I was quite thrilled when I bot the CD and there were parts that I had never knew existed: the extra verse in &quot;I've Got a Theory&quot;, &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;, and &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;. Even the lyrics are included so you can sing along or figure out what's really being sang in some of the songs. I'm so glad Joss decided to add some instrumentals from other Buffy episodes like &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Restless&quot;, and &quot;The Gift&quot;. The demo of &quot;Something to Sing About&quot; where Joss and his wife sing the parts is a great touch to a great CD.<BR>    Any Buffy fan needs to add this CD to their collection because the songs are great, and the actors all have amazing voices that make this cd so fun to listen too.
B0000024Z7|5.0|This is a record with hope in it.<BR>Santana 1-3 was unsurpassed latin rock. Heavy and outstanding.It is not better than these,but in company with Borboletta and Welcome,it makes me feel like humanity tried to explore itself and find new ways.(maybe it was just Carlos that tried to explore life,but he transmitted it well on these records) This is Jazz-oriented and it is not as good as real jazz,and it it not as good as real rock,but it has a true personality that makes it one of my favourites altogether.After these three records he became healthy and industrial,with the exception of <BR>Love ,Devotion and Surrender,wich sounds like John and Carlos trying to imitate John Coltrane,without knowing how to do.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I love this CD!  The singing is actually quite good, better than I thought that it would be. I have this one in the car CD and it is fun to sing-along.
0316666343|4.0|When I first began to read the book, I couldn't put it down.  It was a beautifully written sad story about loss and grieving and ultimately having to let go.  I found that towards the end, as suspenseful as it had been the entire way through even though we knew who the killer was from the beginning, the story fades and becomes just another unbelievable tale.  All in all, I enjoyed the book but wished that there was no Ruth but instead just the family and their lives - I wanted to see them going on with their lives even after such a tragic loss.  Also, everything was too perfect at the end as we all know life never is.
B000005RNQ|4.0|Of all the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal bands who never made it big in American, Saxon were probably the most well-known among metal fans. It's a shame that they never gained the worldwide fame of Iron Maiden or Motorhead, really, but a listen to this album may indicate why: some of the lyrics can be seen as a direct link to Spinal Tap. (Think \\"Princess of the Night\\" is a love...song by looking at the title? Wrong - it's about a decommissioned steam train.) Peter \\"Biff\\" Byford has a very unique voice; I think he sounds kind of like Ian Gillan without the screaming. Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver are a guitar tandem to rival Tipton/Downing or even Murray/Smith. This probably isn't the best place to start with Saxon - I'd get \\"Wheels of Steel\\" first. But this one is an essential.
6304082428|5.0|I have seen this 6+hour video over and over and never tire of it!  Pride and Predjudice is the most beautifully made, romantic, visually and musically rich production ever made (the CD is outstanding.)  Colin Firth is dreamy, and Jennifer Ehle is the perfect Lizzie.  Observe the comedy in Jane Austin's work-which I did not pick up in the book, with such characters as Mr. Collins, Mr and Mrs Bennet.  Titanic, Gone With the Wind, all movies stand second to Pride and Predjudice.  I can't say enough about it!  Family friendly, my 6 year old and my teen adore this movie, too!  Buy it!
0684135051|5.0|Each time I open this book, I want to throw all other responsibilities to the wind and sit down and read. No, it is not a learn-to-knit book; but for one getting familiar with the process, it is a mind-expanding experience. It is also a joyous, friendly way to meet her in print.<br />When first published, most American born knitters made every garment in pieces.  The challenge of making presentable seams was formidable for me, so I welcomed EZ's sensible approach to knitting in the round. <br />I got a kick out of her calling us 'blind-followers,' which most of us were who were inexperienced and perhaps, as I was, self-taught. Having the traditional directions along with her smart short-cuts and the clever, sensible percentage system was enormously helpful for me. <br />The small size of her book is also a plus--easy to digest and learn from without being intimidated. Her skillful illustrations are so clear. The information she so delightfully encloses is still valuable, no matter the year! <br />Elizabeth was a very friendly, lovable, warm,kind woman, and an excellent teacher--in person or by books. I'm happy and proud to have known her. This book is a classic and should be in every knitter's library.
B00005U18E|5.0|Loved the book, loved the video even more!  Casting is outstanding, with Colin Firth and Hugh Grant vying for Renee Zellweger.  Even though it is done with a British slant, you will laugh throughout the video.  My second favorite Colin Firth video---check him out in Pride and Predjudice-WOW!
B000000W5H|3.0|This album is OK, but it's so bloodlessly contrived that it could be KISS.  It's hard to believe that this is the same band that released the masterful &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; just a couple of years before.  But, to be fair, I imagine the mid-70s wasn't the most fertile time to nuture one's art -- you know, with all those, um, &quot;distractions&quot;....
B00005JKNF|1.0|Couldn't follow the story since everyone muttered so much and called each other by their formal names... I turned it off before anyone was murdered... couldn't waste two hours of my life.
B00006AW2G|4.0|This is, hands down, the Stones' most overrated album.  More often than not, you'll hear it described as their best, which makes me think that these people need to listen to &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;, &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot;, or even &quot;Aftermath&quot; again -- and this time with the TV turned down.  Not that &quot;Let it Bleed&quot; is a bad album, far from it -- it's just that songs like &quot;Monkey Man&quot; and &quot;Country Honk&quot; tend to get zapped by the skip button more often than not; and the prententious, overly-dramatic intro to &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want&quot; grates every time.  Other that that, yeah, I'd say this is the Stones' best.  Grrrr...
B00003CX8Y|5.0|It is stunning to look at, hilarious at parts, and tears in the eyes sad at other places. It has a heart the size of a Beast and the soul of a delicate Beauty. It works, every wonderful part of it works.<br />Our family has watched it at least four times in the three days since we got it. In an entertainment world with so much junk, grab up this diamond. Then turn down the lights and be prepared to be swept away in wonderment at just how good a film can be when everyone involved does everything just right.<br />It is going to be a Christmas present for a couple of relatives.
B00006AW2M|2.0|Wow.  This is a really bad album (although &quot;2000 Man&quot; rips, but I digress).  The thing I always dug about the Stones was how they held their own with the Beatles -- album for album, single for single -- up throuigh '66 or so.  And then came this campy mistake in which the boys decided to imitate the Fabs rather than compete with them.  Didn't work.  They should've consulted with Brian Wilson and saved themselves the heartache -- but I understand he wasn't &quot;available&quot; at the time....
B00005ATQ9|4.0|The difference between Stanley Kubrick's \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and the book by William Makepeace Thackeray that was it's source, \\"The Luck Of Barry Lyndon,\\" is the difference between the story of a rogue which is played for subtle comedy and the story of a rogue which is played for high tragedy. <br />Thackeray's telling of the rise and fall of Redman Barry aka Barry Lyndon is done from Barry's perspective---he boisterously proclaims his cunning, bravery and quick-wittedness throughout each of his exploits, and is shown with every statement to be a liar and complete fraud---and yet we almost are compelled to root for him at the end, a man down but not out and with great spirit in the bargain. Kubrick, on the other hand, chooses the third-person vantage point to the story. His Redman Barry is not allowed the protective coloration of his own words and is instead observed by an omniscient narrator as a soul being swept to destruction by his own follies. There's nothing to celebrate about his life as seen in the movie---it's been a life of bad choices and wasted opportunities, ending with him languishing in debtor's prison, completely broken.<br />This is indeed Kubrick's slowest-moving movie, but that's entirely appropriate to the construct of the story. The characters are little chess pieces moving around the ornate landscape of 18th-century Europe, engaging in their intrigues, deceiving one another and themselves and, as the last title says, ending up all equally dust. Dialogue is less important than the juxtaposition of the characters to one another, and therefore it's not the worst thing in the world that both Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson make, at best, adequate journeyman performances in the film. The movie emerges as a whole rather than the sum of it's parts, a concept that's very counter to the notion of \\"star vehicles,\\" but which pays off in dividends here. Add to this the sumptious cinematography (overseen by the late John Alcott, one of the best Directors of Photography in movies over the last forty years) and the music of The Chieftains, Handel, Mozart and others, and what you get is as close to the definitive retelling of 19th-century literature as any American or English movie director ever got.<br />Stanley Kubrick's \\"Barry Lyndon\\" may not go down well with first-time viewers expecting moderate-if-not-fast-paced action throughout. But you may find yourself coming back to it, as I did, and having it grow on you with every screening. It's arguably one of Kubrick's finest filmmaking hours.
B00000I8UD|5.0|Despite being a bit obsessed with bees(this album's title, the album SECRETS OF THE BEEHIVE, and the song &quot;Pollen Path&quot;), David has at last collected sweet nector and placed it into every song of this magical album.<br />A mixture of different colors of music such as electronica, world, new age, jazz, and solid songwriting give this album a sweet taste to enjoy and a sweet scent to follow.<br />Look no furthur than the first song &quot;I Surrender&quot;.  A rather long piece feauturing an electronica loop and jazz guitar, horn and flute, is a declaration of surrendering the soul to love in only a way David can convey.<br />&quot;Dobro #1&quot; is a short impromtu aching poem soothed by the twang of the dobro.  Makes you want to hear the other numbers he must have done with this instrument!  (Two more Dobro songs eventually ended up on the anthology EVERYTHING AND NOTHING).<br />&quot;Midnight Sun&quot; is an amazing blues inspired creation of wooden rhythms, blues gritty guitar, and a brass ensemble emulating a harsh wind backing David's accusation that &quot;you've stolen the moon&quot;!  One of the finest moments on this collection.<br />&quot;Thailheim&quot; meanders thru what seems like two songs put together like two rivers converging.  A merging sound of airy far off music and David's honeyed words.<br />Other standout tracks include &quot;Krishna Blue&quot;, &quot;Shining of Things&quot; (weeping strings are the only backup for David's voice....it is unbelievably incredible to hear!!), &quot;All My Mother's Names&quot;, the walking gait of &quot;Wanderlust&quot; and the final moment with David on &quot;Darkest Dreaming&quot; brings afternoon to evening.<br />This is an album carefully crafted with each song supporting the next finishing off with sweet words, inspired music, and of course...bees.
B000003N7K|4.0|This is a historical album, John Coltrane and Johnny Hartamn both sound beautiful together. Johnny's deep yet soft voice is just unreal and sometimes haunting and Mr. Coltrane's playing on this I think is his best. I've never really cared for him until now this album shows that he dosnt have to play wild to sound great. I love the tunes on here every song is done so well I really like \\"Lush Life\\" and \\"My One And Only Love\\". McCoy Tyner plays at his best and Elvin Jones really lays back and it sounds great and I also really enjoyed the Bass player Jimmy Garrison who is a mix between Ray Brown and Major \\"MULE\\" Holly I would recomend this album to any jazz fan or anyone who wants to spend the night cuddled up to there loved one sitting by a fire.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is great and Avril really speaks her mind. She doesn't care what people think of her and she bes herself. She tells the truth of how things are today being a teenager through her songs. People judge you by how you dress and in the song &quot;Skater Boy&quot; and &quot;Complicated&quot; it explains it very well, and having people judge you for wearing something is wrong. &quot;Preps&quot; seem to think they are better then &quot;skaters&quot; or whatever else people consider themselves. Everyone is the same and the fact they judge you by clothes is wrong.<BR>Anyways, Avrils CD is great. Like I said before her songs are real and she expresses herself really well. She's a great new artist, give the CD a chance and I can garentee you will enjoy it. However, it's basically a one memember group since she takes a lot of the credit for herself and not for other members.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is an awesome CD. But it is less Uncle Tupelo than a kind of  new age Bob Dylan. Wilco's lyrics and music are not immediatly catchy, except for a couple of songs, but the word immediate is the key one. After 4 or 5 listens, you see that the music and the lyrics are pure genius. Listening to &quot;Ashes of American Flags&quot; when you're depressed or watching some 9/11 special will make you feel some strong emotions, whether good or bad. &quot; i'm the man who loves you&quot; is great because of how they keep up a happy melody while some great guitar player in the band goes crazy in a totally original, psychotic way. The main effect of the whole CD is one of total brilliance once you begin to understand it. Don't listen to the people who don't give any effort to their listening. Actually trying is well worth it.
B00006IJ0Z|4.0|I am glad that us vinyl is being pressed again. While I wish the liner notes had been included it sounds great on the best format vinyl. Elvis is great and my favorite artist for the last 20 years. Sadly three songs are not the orginals and though cool to have it is misleading. &quot;Wonder Of You&quot;, &quot;Fool Such As I&quot; and &quot;Big Hunk O'Love&quot;1 are the 3 numbers. Big Hunk has not been released with the right take for ten years cd or vinyl. Still buy this especally if this is your first Elvis or vinyl for a while.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis 30 #1 Hits is quite simply the greatest Elvis collection ever.  The sound quality is startling, and especially so when you listen to his early hits.  This collection, which is in chronological order, begins with \\"Heartbreak Hotel, and ends with the surprise hit \\"A Little Less Conversation\\", which was actually recorded by Elvis in 1968, but was re-mixed. The last song here, which was recorded by Elvis just 8 months before his death, is \\"Way Down\\" and shows The King still \\"had it\\" even near the end. In an era of so-so music, \\"Elvis 30 #1 Hits\\" is a breath of fresh air, and reminds us of what real talent is. I would highly recommend this to even the most casual Elvis fan.  Pop this one in your car stereo and enjoy!
6305949980|5.0|This is a true dark masterpiece by Tim Burton! They have some of the most unforgottable characters such as Jack Skellengton. The plot here is (spoliers not included thank God) Halloween Town's greatest hero is Jack Skellengton but he has just grown tired of the same old thing...I won't tell how he gets there but he somehow stumbles into Christmas Town singing the unforgattble song &quot;What's This&quot;. The fellow members of Halloween Town kidnap &quot;Sandy Claws&quot; and give him to Oogy Boogy. The songs are extremly well done and though out. But the only sane person in Halloween Town is Sandy who loves Jack but he dosen't know yet. The animation is fluid and bouncy and the dialouge is very witty and genius. In conclusion, this is an unforgatble Disney film that shouldn't be missed by anyone who had a soft spot for Lilo and Stitch and other great flicks.
B00003XB8K|5.0|Silence must be heard?Silence CAN be heard.Talking about the music,all their works are great,enjoyable,creative and exciting to me.It's a good job done by desire.There's fighting and loss between mind and heart.I hear mind's still trying to play the game of controlling.It's talking loudly behind the mirror.Enigma 5 must be very different,they are sure singing and dancing with dream and power on that never ending journey.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I have been waiting for this soundtrack since watching what I consider to be the best piece of television I saw in 2002. First shown in the US in November 2001, the episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot; was the best present a Buffy fan who likes musicals could receive. A witty, fun, dramatic and moving piece of television that was so well written and performed and all on this wonderful CD. Watch the episode soon on BBC and then buy this soundtrack.
B00006HBUB|5.0|If you are a big Scooby Doo fan, you may love this movie. Scooby Doo follows both Popeye and the Flintstones that started out as a cartoon and jumps to live action. As the movie begins, Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr) gives himself credit for the gang's newest mystery which leads Velma (Linda Cardellini) to quit, along with Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), which leaves Shaggy (Matthew Lillard) and Scooby Doo along with the mystery machine. After 2 years, Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby accept a mystery to Sppoky Island, and they run into each other at the airport. The island's owner (Rowan Atkinson) arrive in good spirts and leave as teenagers. Buy this movie, you will not be disappointed in less in have already seen the movie, or do see it and get disappointed anyways. I don't know who does the voice of Scooby-Doo but if you do or have seen on the dvd on Scooby-Doo please e-mail me .... And please let me know you know of it. If you seen on on dvd and they mention it on the making of it or you seen it listed, If I can remember correctly I have seen two people listed.

In any case, for those of us who really listen to music...<BR>I mean REALLY LISTEN, there is a lot to be heard, for better or worse. This is the best Elvis hits compilation to date... a good purchase even if you already have the material. This stuff sounds fresh and reminds me of what the hoopla was all about in the first place...
0316666343|4.0|&quot;My name was Salmon, like the fish: first name, Susie.  I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.  My murderer was a man from our neighbourhood.  My mother liked his border flowers, and my father talked to him once about fertilizer.&quot;<BR>So begins 'The Lovely Bones.'  It pulls you in with its opening paragraph, and doesn't let you go until the end.<BR>I think the author was terribly brave to write such a story, and the way in which she executes it is amazing.<br />Susie's take on heaven and all that can happen between heaven and earth seems to ring true; it's like it explains all the weird de ja vu and eerie happenings that happen on earth - the things we tend to push aside as 'coincidences'.<br />This book is a kind of 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Others', only Susie doesn't get to stand on earth as a ghost; instead she looks down from heaven, yearning to be one of the living, to grow up and fall in love the way her friends and sister get to.  In heaven, no moment on earth is taken for granted, and the experiences of a once-living fourteen-year-old Susie are held extra precious as there are no new earthly experiences to take away their magic.<br />I recommend this book for its originality and for the moments that almost form a tear in your eye.  Dad and Holiday are two of my favourite characters.<br />Read it.
B00003CXSP|3.0|At the end Hammer films churned out a number of overwrought films with heavy handed direction and weak scripts. What has all that got to do with Hannibal? Read on and you'll find out. First, the title should have been a dead give away that this was not SOL or Red Dragon.<br />Hannibal has more in common with Alien than with Silence Of The Lambs. Ridley Scott has made a mainstream horror film. It's a shell game really. Scott has taken the genre trappings and put them under another walnut too swiftly for most folks to see. The baroque novel that Thomas Harris wrote really wasn't a very good sequel to his two popular bestsellers Red Dragon and SOTL. The screenplay does the best with what it's got.<br />The performances are over the top as can be expected in a gradiose horror spectacle. Gladiator, Scott's previous film, took Spartacus and merged it with a sword and sandal b movie creating a new sort of gory epic. With the added element of that film's satire (greatly on display in Hannibal as well), this uneasy alliance of different genres worked pretty well.<br />It's a pity that Jodie Foster didn't return to the role of Clarice Starling. Having Julianne Moore play the role brings a different element to the role. She has a world weariness and maturity that Foster might not have been able to bring to the table. That's not slightling Foster. It's a compliment to Moore in that she brought her own interpretation and emotional baggage to the role. Anthony Hopkins is, as befits his character, all over the place. He overplays the role a bit but it works given the film's context as a horror film. Ray Liotta plays a scummy FBI agent that is everything Starling is not -- a perfect foil who is more glory hound and politican than devoted government agent.<br />The screenplay improves Harris' feeble novel. The elements that were taken out are more in line with how the audience believed the characters would behave. In fact, it seems as if Harris' novel has completely different characters with the same names as in the previous work. That's not the case with the film. It's true to its character sources.<br />Is this film detestable? Frankly, there are moments that are pretty disgusting. But these moments also prevent Hannibal from becoming the anti-hero of the piece. He does unpleasant and disgusting things because he's evil. There's no cosmic sense of justice at work. That's where Moore's performance as Starling works well--she becomes the moral center of the film. Despite her dishonor, she continues to hold on to her sense of morality. It isn't dictated by politics but by what is right.<br />The film runs too long and the convulted plot doesn't hang together as well here as it did in SOTL (or Red Dragon). The later is due to the poor source material. I read Harris' book and, frankly, he was trying to destroy the sense of \\"romance\\" that had arisen around these two characters. While his intention was honorable, the plotting for Hannibal was sloppy and the character motivations poorly thought out. The screenwriters do a good job of cleaning up the book and making the story more coherent and presentable. Scott does keep Harris' tone though and that's probably what disgusts people more than anything else but it was meant to disgust at the same time as entertain.<br />You'll enjoy this film if you accept it not as a thriller but as a horror film. Silence Of The Lambs was a thriller in the Hitchcockian sense. Hannibal is clearly informed by all the European (particularly Italian) low budget horror films made during the 70's and 80's. Hannibal could have been directed by Mario Bava (if he was alive of course) with similar results. The film is powerful, unpleasant and atmospheric. It's also entertaining in a sick sort of horror film way. Which is precisely what Scott was aiming for. The cult of Lecter needed to be shaken up so that the audience can see him for what he is; a charming, arrogant sociopathic monster. Hannibal is a clear descendant of the type of films Hammer churned out in the late 60's and early 70's. Perhaps that's how it was intended. I'd suggest avoiding Hannibal if you're pretty easily sickened by gore.e type of films Hammer churned out in the late 60's and early 70's. Perhaps that's how it was intended.

B000067DNC|5.0|Wow! What a great series Sg-1 is! I currently owned season 1 set, and now I have ten discs of Stargate!!! Of course the episodes are great, but in the DVD release some things could have been done better. There are only three featurettes and trailers for each episode, which isn't much for five DVDs (X-Files DVD sets offer documents and behind the scenes stuff). But the look of the box is great. Video quality is very good for the TV-series, though some background noise appears, and the sound is almost outstanding Dolby 5.1! This is very good set, a lack of extras don't spoil it completely.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|Superficial, undeveloped characters sing absurdly arranged medlys of Air Supply, Elton John, Beatles, U2, Madonna, and Nirvana songs in turn of the 20th century Paris (no, I am not making this up).  After \\"Like A Virgin\\" was performed, the tv was turned off.    While tons of thought, work and creativity obviously went into these costumes and sets, I just thought this movie was weak in artistic sensibility and totally lacking in taste.  And that camera work!!
0812550706|5.0|This book really hit me deep. Card portrays Ender and his young commrades in such a life like way that you can really get into the character. I found myself thinking as Ender and trying to figure out what he would do. Its a book that really changes the way you think about everything. Suddenly everything becomes a challenge like Ender faces. Something that can be overcome, something to test your limits. Every child should read it. I just finished it today at school and i already want to change the way i've led my life and got the sequel on the way home. Ender is a role model for childeren and adults everywhere. I hope other people can connect with it the way i have.

B00005AAFS|5.0|This album, Rammstein's third, is truly a masterpiece.  I actually had heard very little of Rammstein before acquiring this:  only the songs Du Hast and Engel from Sensucht.  Well, Once I delved into this album, Rammstein instantly became one of my favorite bands.  Their songs are passionate, sometimes exhilirating.  Not only that, but they include guitar solos in their music, which is rare for industrial metal.  This CD is essential to any metal collection, as are Sensucht, Herzeleid, and Live aus Berlin.  Rammstein are truly among the saviours of modern metal.
1559409002|5.0|Much has been written about this 1962 classic film and a remake was even made in 1998, but the film still remains an enigma. The lighting, camera work, makeup and music score are all very original and still manage to haunt 40 years after it's release. The remake was a decent idea gone bad. Don't even bother with it. <br />In 1962, industrial film director Herk Harvey decided to make a horror film. He had previously made about 40 films for school and industry with such titles as: What About School Spirit? (1958), Caring for Your Toys (1954) , Street Safety Is Your Problem (1952) and Your Junior High Days (1961). He enlisted the help of fellow Kansans John Clifford (screenplay) and Maurice Prather (cinematographer) to help him and they recruited local talent to act in the film. The lead character, Mary Henry (played by Candice Hilligloss), only appeared in one other film. Most of the other actors have this movie as their only film acting credit. <br />There are many dvd releases of this film. Even the cheapest and most no frills copy would be worth owning and watching. The one that stands far above the rest however is the Criterion Collection version. This 2 disk set has an amazing amount of features including a 1989 reunion of the actors, writer, and director, Herk Harvey. It's quite the dvd set and you will know everything there is to know about all of the principles involved. I understand that this also may not be a good thing for some people...<br />So the basic story is that Mary Henry is involved in a drag race in rural Kansas that results in her car driving off of a bridge into a river. She manages to walk away from the accident, but afterwards she is haunted by a ghoulish looking man. She ends up getting a job as an organist at a church in Salt Lake City but is still seeing the ghoul man. She also starts felling compelled to go to an old, abandoned carnival. This is the basic story and I don't want to give away any more for those of you who have not seen the movie. <br />This really is a classic and somewhat of a landmark film. After making this film, Herk Harvey and John Clifford continued working for the same industrial film company as if nothing had happened. Over the years the movie started fading away from peoples memory until the advent of VHS tapes. The movie was a popular rental and it developed a cult following which prompted Candice Hilligloss to contact an aging Herk Harvey to try and make a sequel or remake. This fell through but eventually a remake (of sorts) was made titled &quot;Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls&quot;. John Clifford has the lead writing credit and at least one actor from the original, Sidney Berger, appears in the remake. But this is not an endorsement to rush out and see the remake. And this is not from some purists viewpoint either. It is simply confusing and nonsensical and resembles the original in title only. As for the original, buy it, watch it, make others watch it.
B00005AQE8|3.0|It's a shame to think of how 2Pac's would-be greatest album turned out - it was one disc too long. It's a common criticism of double albums - and one that has been used by critics ever since the Beatles released their White Album. But here, it's true. Some of the material on All Eyez On Me is very good, even amazing sometimes; on Only God Can Judge Me 2Pac suddenly explodes in a shower of pure skilful rhymes: \\"I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward/There's a ghetto up in heaven and it's ours/Black power/Is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state/And our fate is a lifetime of hate..\\" what follows is a splendid musical climax which along with Pac's marvellous rhyming skills coalesces with breathtaking momentum. Unfortunately, there isn't much more to match moments like that; vivacious duets with Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre are welcome, but with two hours of this, it grows extremely tiresome by the end; there's probably more to criticize there than there is to praise but Pac certainly had the right formula to make a first-class hip-hop album, but All Eyez On Me is not too appealing when the listener must trudge through much crummy material to get to the good stuff.
B00004XPPK|5.0|The hottest film noir from the 40's,\\"Gilda\\" is what Rita Hayworth was all about---sex, glamour and vulnerability. She does to the b&w 40's screen what Marilyn did to the 50's Technicolor one. She sets it on fire. Married to a sinister Buenos Aries casino owner old enough to be her father, she's a wild kept toy. But when the man hires a bodyguard (Glenn Ford) to keep an eye on his wandering wife, all hell breaks loose. It seems they've \\"known\\" each other before. Both have shady pasts. Gilda gets wilder to test the limits of this bodyguard and pushes him to the brink. She performs a Latin-esque song/dance number \\"Amado Mio\\" that spells out her feelings. Later, a mock strip-tease to \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\" that drives Ford to the boiling point puts Hayworth on the map as a femme fatale to be reckoned with. \\"Gilda\\" is a classic and should not be missed by 40's film lovers. The DVD is beautifully presented and a keeper. Hayworth and Ford are dynamite together.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The biggest flaw in this story ... is that it makes a 45-year-old man cry like a child every time I watch it.  My opinions on Disney movies vary -- some are good, some are almost unwatchable -- but &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is the best work the studio has ever done.<br />Why do I love this movie so much?  I think it's the music.  In some musicals (animated or live), as soon as a song begins, the story comes to a grinding halt.  (Can anyone remember one tune from &quot;Mulan&quot;?)  But in this film, the music by Ashman and Menken advances the story marvellously.  Animation and voice acting combine in a near-flawless performance, and the use of computer animation in the ballroom dance sequence was ground-breaking in its time.<br />As for the added features, the added song &quot;Human Again&quot; is a wonderful fun number.  I can understand why it was left out of the original version, but its inclusion really doesn't detract from the story (it's another big production number like &quot;Be Our Guest&quot;, not really essential to the plot, but helps us get to know the supporting characters).<br />The &quot;making of&quot; features are fairly interesting; the on-disk games I can take or leave.  But the film itself is still the gem, worth the purchase price all by itself; the standard by which all other Disney movies are measured.

0786867973|4.0|This is the most sensual cookbook I have read, turning what is to some a mundane satisfaction of a body's need into a near erotic experience - - where else is creme patissiere called \\"...utter, smooth voluptuousness...\\"<BR>The short comings I note are the insistance on using self rising flour and an absence of subjective descriptions of what the end point of a product should be.  Again back to the creme patissiere, why not tell me it should be thickened to the consistency of_______, rather than \\"...utter, smooth voluptuousness...\\".  Had I not seen this made by my dear old Mum I may not have had a lovely Boston Creme Pie, but rather a runny trifle on a cake stand.
B00006IUL7|5.0|Without a shadow of a doubt, &quot;Insomnia&quot; is the best movie of 2002. Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) has been sent up to Alaska to investigate a homicide. In the small, quaint city, Dormer is on pursuit for a psychological killer and fights with a faulty past. While searching for the madman, Dormer loses sleep due to the atmosphere and his personal guilt. The movie does a good job with the setting and the lush scenery is perfect for the story's mood. The film centers around the characters and it's surprising to see Al Pacino not make so much noise. It was great. Robin Williams in a different role and Hilary Swank was kicking major buttocks. Kudos for the director Christopher Nolan with this follow-up to &quot;Memento.&quot;
B00006J3T4|1.0|As a huge fan of Mark Knopfler since the first Dire Staits Album, it's time he moved on from the Nashville scene to create music that more cutting edge.

6305428522|5.0|This marvelous film has been rightly praised for the excellence of its actors and the intelligence and wit of its dialogue.  What has not been singled out sufficiently, though, is the film's insightful, indeed unerring documentation of that lamentable Post World War II transition in the States from a brahmin culture of family and/or intellect to one merely of celebrity and new money, very much our society of today, from which the old Wasp elite and the New York Jewish intellectuals, each the upholders of higher standards, have essentially disappeared. Unlike the gracious old Van Doren and the ethical young Goodwin, Charles Van Doren, the young Wasp intellectual, Stempel, the Jewish self-taught proficient,and the relatively new medium, television itself, represent the unbeatable wave of a debased future.  For its poise and shrewd wit in illuminating this decline, the film deserves the highest marks.
0451196716|3.0|I occasionally describe a movie as \\"Like watching a trainwreck.\\"  You don't want to watch, but you can't quit.  That's the way _The Long Walk_ works.  It is excruciating.  As usual Stephen King's dialog for boys is right on -- they are all teenagers, of varying sophistication -- all (but one) doomed to die -- and yet they walk on.  We never know how the long walk got started, why it is tolerated, how there could be a civilization that would take 100 young men, carefully selected, and run them down into the ground, shooting each one mercilessly as they fail.  Obviously, King was considering the Ultimate Game Show;  miss a question and you die.  The only real fascination in this book is wondering how he will kill off the odds-on favorites.  They get colds, they go crazy, etc. etc. ad nauseum.  I really wanted to put the book away (and did, to read some other book) but ultimately I had to finish it, just like I'd have to watch that train wreck until the last car stops.<br />So.  You've been warned.
0451167716|5.0|I picked up this book when I was a teen and read it simply because I wanted to read the #1 bestseller.  I remember enjoying it very much and then a couple of years seeing the movie and being rather disappointed in the movie (in comparison to the book).<br />Anyway, about a month ago I was rollerblading through the streets of Chicago and ran across a garage sale.  They had a beat up paperback of the Godfather, first paperback printing.  No cover.  I bought it for a dime and started reading it that day.<br />I brought that beat up paperback with me everyday for the next week and finished it off relatively quickly.  <br />The book is simply magnificent; I found that I had forgotten almost everything during the 30 year span between readings.  I hadn't forgotten the part about Sonny banging Lucy standing up against the door though!<br />The great Don, it is repeated at least three times, \\"is notoriously straitlaced on matters concerning sex.\\"  This is just one of the many fascinating glimpses into the mind of the central character Vito Corleone.<br />Although Vito Corleone may be the central character, contributing to the greatness of this book is the superior development of a host of very interesting characters.  Such as Michael, Sonny, Tom Hagen, Tessio and Clemenza, Lucas Brasi and Albert Neri, Carlo Rizzo, Tattaglia, Barzini and the other dons, Amerigo Bonasero, Nazzarine, Paulie Gatto, Johnny Fontane, Woltz, Mama Corlene, Kate and Apollonia, Fabrizio and the other sheperd, Don Tommasino, the island of Sicily, the depiction of the \\"brutes\\" from Chicago.<br />The scenarios of vengeance and retaliation are the most exciting you will ever read in my opinion.<br />Many interesting insights into the human condition are covered going along with the flow of the novel.  One thing I found interesting is how many Sicilians cannot grasp how anyone would put anything more than a trivial value on the \\"sexual powers of a woman.\\"<br />I've read many Puzo books and only this one didI read twice....I will probably read it again in the next thirty years.  It is timeless.

I've heard a couple of cuts on the jazz station and read enough good reviews to figure she was worth checking out. Maybe I got the wrong Diana Krall CD, because this one did nothing much for me. It's a nice collection of songs, I just wish someone else was singing them.
1587990717|5.0|Taleb's first book, _Dynamic Hedging_, is the options trader's trading book.  Easily the finest book on the subject, it has just enough math for rigor, and plenty of intuition and application.  So I picked up _Fooled By Randomness_ to see what the man would have to say with many more words and many fewer equations.  This is a wonderful book, full of humor and subtlety.  Don't expect it to impart the secrets of success in the financial markets -- it's more a collection of anecdotes and thoughts from a successful career.  But it sheds light on the kind of thinking necessary to ensure longevity in trading.

0345456343|5.0|Many people know of Anne Rice's \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" due to the popular movie starring Tom Cruise & Brad Pitt.  But what some may not be aware of is that \\"Interview\\" is only one part of a much larger tale.<br />Rice has been at it for many years and the Vampire Chronicles span innumberable volumes by this point in time. A reason to buy this particular book is that it collects the first three, and most essential novels in an affordable single edition.  <br />While Rice's future work suffers from sameness and lack of a good editor, this trilogy (Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned) is filled with striking imagery and an emotional resonance that commands attention.  You journey with these characters as they grapple with issues of good and evil, and search for the meaning of their existence... complete with sex and blood and explosions, all that good stuff.<br />The novels contained in this volume are hugely entertaining and shift through many different moods, perhaps all you ever need to know  about Anne Rice - it stands as her best legacy.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix, as other reviers will attest to, is a slick cyberpunk thriller set in a dismal world. However, there is one thing that must be noted, above all. No, it is not the coolness of bullet-time, though that is cool. It's not the martial arts, though they are well coreographed. And it's certainly not Reves acting. The best part of the Matrix is described in one word: Lobby.<br />If you haven't seen the Matrix yet, I won't spoil the plot for you. However, I will just breifly describe the scene I'm refering too. In it, Neo (Reeves) enters the lobby for a high security building, of purpose unknown, and steps through a metal detector. It beeps. One of the guards walks up to him and asks him to for his keys, change...<BR>Reeves opens his trenchcoat and exposes his hardware (and no, that's not a sexual pun): about twenty assault weapons. He pushes the guard...<br />That is the start for what is the lynchpin, the strongest scene of the film. Take out the Lobby, and you still have a fair movie. But it's missing something. The Lobby scene is easily the best gunfight ever recorded on film. The tiles of the floor shatter beautifully as Neo flips around, unscathed. And at the end, where Trinity (Moss) grabbs the bag and heads towards the elevator before the last gun can hit the scarred floor... That, more then anything else, makes me crave the Reload.
B00005JKHZ|5.0|The caption on the movie poster read, \\"Makes Bullit look like drivers' training.\\" This was back in the days when a new car was larger than a sofa and didn't resemble a jelly bean or a bar of soap so much as a statement of aesthetic poise and integrity. <BR>The movie is a sort of mock epic of an anti-heroes' journey through the desert from Denver to San Francisco in what is supposed to happen in less than 15 hours. Although he supposedly commits suicide by running into two buldozers at 160 mph, the beginning shows him spinning around to again elude the state troopers. He is then shown delivering a 1970 Chrysler Imperial to where he will get a 1970 Dodge Hemi Challenger R/T and attempt to deliver it to its destination in 15 hours. Because the end shows a 1969 Camaro crashing into the bulldozers, and the beginning shows him eluding the state troopers, it becomes questionable if he does commit suicide. The twin themes of speed and death that permeate the film give it a sense of adrenaline, that perhaps speed is what makes one feel the most alive, and in this sense one eludes death, if only temporarily.<BR>I liked the scene where Kowalski is challenged by a Jaguar XKE, but hated to see a Jaguar get destroyed. Maybe they could have used a Pinto with a Boss 302, instead of a Jaguar.<BR>Although it featured a great soundtrack, songs such as The Allman Brothers' \\"Midnight Rider\\", Free's \\"Allright Now,\\" Led Zepplins' \\"Heartbreaker,\\" or even the later released Deep Purples' \\"Highway Star\\" would have worked well in this film.<BR>Another thing worth mentioning is that this film has much in common with \\"Easy Rider.\\" This was yet another counter-culture film where the police, the government, and the establishment are all the bad guys and are given stereotypical roles.<BR>Although Kowalski doesn't have much dialogue in this film, we are granted insight into his character through a series of flashbacks that show him as a frustrated and idealistic loner. Therefore it seems likely that speed and death are the only solutions he chooses to solve his problems. But the scene where the Camaro crashes into the bulldozers raises the question, did he, or didn't he?
B000069AUI|5.0|A very talented band. Simple, cliche'd lyrics? Yeah there is some of that, but their instrumental and song writing talent are very entertaining and inviting.<br />I wish the pretentious crowd would just lay-off.  Coldplay has released an excellent CD and I guess it doesn't live up to the pretentious &quot;I'm not sure what he's singing about, but will pretend I do&quot; crowd whent it comes to so many other bands who wrap great sounding music around questionable lyrics too personally involved for most to truly understand any ways.  The songs are simply about things we can all relate to, every day feelings and emotions without being typical Top 40 pop and R&amp;B bubble gum junk.    <br />I really enjoy their sound, musicianship and ability to write very listenable songs without falling into the utterly boring Radiohead/Dave Matthews clone band they are so often compared to.  They are much better than both of those groups as for enjoyable, distinctive songs that stick with you and make a real impression.<br />I find myself listening to them more and more.  Like Nirvana, they are proof that simple, but creative, catchy guitar oriented rock played by talented people can still exist and be very good.
B000068IEU|4.0|The term \\"Cult Classic\\" was made for movies like this, since it got more notoriety among horror fans than any other movie. It's reputation for raw brutality and uninhibited violence still stands 30 years after the movie being made. \\"Last House On The Left\\" is one of those movies you enjoy, even though the probably shouldn't.<br />\\"Last House On The Left\\" follows the standard revenge formula, in which two teenagers are murdered, and the parents execute a terrible revenge on the killers. The characters are surprisingly well developed, considering that characters in movies like this usually exist for the sole purpose of dying a bloody death. The cast contains largely unknown actors who had little subsequent success after \\"Last House On The Left\\", and as the commentary suggests, this movie might have been the reason for that.  \\"Last House On The Left\\" looks like what it is, an ambitious amateur movie, which tried hard to push the envelope, and succeeded. The acting and writing is all amateur night, and there are areas where the movie suffers from ill-timed humor. The police characters were totally unnecessary, and only adds screwball, \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" style comedy where it is neither needed nor wanted. One thing I will give kudos for is the music score, which is the best example of juxtaposition I have seen in a horror movie. Watch it and you'll see what I mean.<br />This is the closest thing to the completed version that has ever been released. The original cut ran 91 minutes, but with much of the scenes edited out to meet the sensitivities of the public at large, and much of the audio for the cut scenes being lost, a full version would be impossible. The DVD runs 84 minutes, which amounts to roughly 1-2 minutes of gore, but believe me, you will notice the difference if you've seen the edited version.  The picture quality brings the best out of a bad print. The picture is grainy and dirty at times, but like all low-budget movies, it is hard to make it look like it was shot in 35mm. The DVD extras are plentiful, and should more that appease horror fans. It has a 28 minute documentary aptly titled \\"It's Only A Movie\\", and it features Wes Craven et all giving their insights into the impact and appeal of the movie. The commentary by Craven and Sean S. Cunningham is inspired, funny, and thought provoking.  The reel of deleted scenes is the real gold mine for collectors. Included at all the violent bits that they cut out, including the infamous disemboweling scenes. People with weak stomachs should avoid this movie at all costs.

Not here. &quot;Acrobat&quot;, &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;: how can &quot;One&quot; stand out among such hits? Each song stands out from it's kin, from the surreal &quot;Zoo Station&quot; to the poingent &quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot;. &quot;One&quot; is first among peers, making this a disk that everyone should get.
B000065U1N|5.0|This motion picture is a masterpiece. From the start of the fight, you can tell Ridley Scott did a great job. Tom Sizemore asks how much longer to get the humvies out, and he has to repeat himselfto hear. It makes you feel like your in the war, and how its so chaotic that you can't hear someone standing next to you.<br />The only problem I have is that Josh Harnett is too much of a hero. When Todd Blackburn was going to fall, he shouted, \\" Go Blackburn go, go blackburn go\\", so you could tell something was going to happen. He also saw the RPG. Another part was when a soilder got his thumb shot off, (he went back to get it, so it shows how brave the soilders really were), but Harnett shouted \\"Are you OK, are you ok? NO! Don't go back\\". Another fault was when Sgt. Dominek Pilla was about to get killed, the guy shooting from the roof had white hands. <br />This movie showed bravery (when the guy went to get his gun after his thumb was shot off), the violence of war ( When Tom Sizemore couldn't hear the guy right next to him, and when the kid shot his mother), and how the US Soilders felt ( When the soilders went back into the battle when they didn't have to, and the music also put a kind of mood into it). Another great job on Ridley Scotts part was when the 1st bird (Wolcotts) crashed, the entire tide of the battle moved. You could tell, which was a great part on Ridley Scotts part.<br />Here's my LEAP rating:(out of 10)<br />Language:9 Displays the raw art of war, but some bad lines by Josh Harnett takes something out of it.<br />Erotica: n/a<br />Acting:9 GREAT acting, emotions and facial expressions tell it all, but Josh Harnett takes some away (again)<br />Plot:10 Attack on Somalia goes bad, and once Wolcotts bird goes down, it gets frantic.
B00005JKG5|4.0|I have been waiting forever for this movie to come out on DVD. I have to respectfully disgagree with those who say Jennifer Beals isn't a good actress. See her in the movie \\"Four Rooms\\" if you don't believe me. She was really good in this movie, and it's a shame she didn't become a bigger star because of this. There was urban legend maybe that Madonna was up for this role. I love the Material Girl, but I can't imagine her in this role at all. Jennifer was an excellent choice. I'm still not happy with the ending, and I'm still a bit confused as to who exactly Hannah was to Alex. I wish they would have explored their relationship a bit more.<br />My question for anyone who has seen this on DVD is this. There are some scenes missing. The first scene, and I remember this, is the scene where she goes to the dog Grunt, (not Brute as I previously wrote) \\"Grunt, you're getting fat. You're going to need to work out\\" or something to that effect. The scene where Alex and Jeanie are watching the breakdancers is also shorter than I remember. Is this a case, as with Fast Times at Ridgemont High where you got one version on TV and one on video or DVD. I never had a chance to see it in the theaters, as I was about 3 or so when the actual movie was released. I'm just confused here. <br />Other than that, I'm glad this was finally put on DVD, although I'm also a little bit disapointed by the lack of extras and the possible editing. Not even a trailer for the movie was included. Hopefully another version will be released sometime in the future.
B00005K3NY|5.0|10 Seconds... THE PAIN BEGINS.<BR>This film is a real curiosity because it's a biological horror movie made for a mass commercial distribution. But far from making his cinematic art and vision softer than they were in his previous films, \\"The Parasite Murders\\", \\"Rabid\\" and \\"The Brood\\", David Cronenberg goes further, straight to the brain, the most complex and important organ in the human body. Even if here, the treatment is more on the level: the good against the evil. Four years after Brian de Palma's \\"Carrie\\", dealing with telekinesis, Cronenberg introduces us to another paranormal phenomenon.<br />20 Seconds... YOU CAN'T BREATHE.<BR>A 'Scanner' is a person with a particularity: a dysfunction of the synapses in his brain, also called 'telepathy', the ability to mentally penetrate anybody's mind, to possess it. Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside) is one of them, one of the most powerful, and the most ambitious. In some distance, he's able to make anybody do anything, included kill himself. During a meeting he gives a demonstration of his power, blowing up the head of another Scanner, one of the most famous 'gore' scenes ever shown on a wide screen. His ambition is take his revenge on the normal people who isolated the whole community of telepaths, who put it in some kind of a ghetto, and dominate the world. Only one person can do something about it: a Scanner as powerful as he is, maybe more. Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack), a homeless, disturbed man, is the one, and Dr. Paul Russ (Patrick McGoohan) is, with Revok, the only one to know about it. After some time of effective investigation Vale manages to mentally penetrate and destroy the heart of a big computer which contains a very important program about a medicine, the Ephemerol, supposed to shut down the power of the Scanners but also to create other Scanners, through pregnant women. The psychological fight between Cameron and Darryl can begin, even when Darryl reveals Cameron that they're brothers, and that Dr. Paul Russ is their father, who gave some Ephemerol to his wife.<br />30 Seconds... YOU EXPLODE.<BR>This astounding movie, now a classic masterpiece, was n° 1 in America when it was released and it's not a surprise. If the story is not very innovative, we can't say the same about the way it's used and treated. To the usual fight between the good and the evil is added a reflection about genetical experiments from medicine men, and their eventual consequences in our societies. The script, well written and told, is very intelligent, the art direction and 'gore' special effects are perfect and the acting is solid. It's the first popular film Cronenberg has made, and along with his next release, \\"Videodrome\\", it's still one of his best and most original and curious. A rare piece of intelligent and efficient 'gore' cinema.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar has no strikes against them. Bugs Life was a fun film, while the Toy Story films established them as a cut above. While Disney made \\"Dinosaur\\" and \\"Atlantis\\", Pixar was where the good films were at. Monster's Inc. raises the bar further, to a height most film makers would have a difficult time accheiving.<BR>Although some say that it should have ended differently, without the reconstruction (I'm having difficulty explaining it without spoiling the magnificent ending), I have two problems with that logic. Firstly, that would end the film on a different note. Secondly, the final \\"shot\\" of the film was one of the defining shots of the film; at least a quarter of the films final charm would be lost without that ending.<br />As for the second disk in the DVD, it's worth the price all by itself-I reccomend you buy the set before the retailers realizes that. \\"For the Birds\\" is anything but: it's hard to pack so much humor, and a moral, in so short a time. \\"Mike's New Car\\" is also entertaining. And the Company Play will have people rolling in the... um, on the couch, I guess. The expression doesn't hold up here.<BR>Then add the rest of the bonus materials, including the monkey, and one of the best kid's movies of the past few years, and you have a DVD essential.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  As with most Pixar Movies they are those type that are great to watch over and over again.  my year and a half old daughter asks &quot;Monster Monster&quot; everytime she comes home so I have seen this a lot.  Only better Pixar Movie I would say is Toy Story Two.
055375596X|4.0|Needless to say, I enjoyed the cassett tapes of his book  read by David Duke.  I thought his voice was perfect and it made me feel like I was right there in the story living out the story as he read it.  Now is that a reader or what?  Coupled with the grand master's story by DeMille, you have a formula that cannot be beat.  DeMille, if you are out there you should have Duke read all of your books.<br />I absolutely loved the story.  Can't you see Cory, the seen it all, lived it all, been everywhere and know it all trying to stay away from the underworld of crime while he recuperates.  It just cannot be done.  So, it was only natural for someone to come along and breakup his boring rest period.  Had it not been friends of his, he still would have jumped at any chance someone may have teased him with to flex his \\"I am superior\\" detective muscles.<br />Corey brings a bit of lightheartedness to the story that may not have been able to be obtained without him.  He also brings a good bit of detetive savvy along as well.  <br />During a time when we are undergoing so much attention about chemical and bioterrorist warfare, this book could not have been better timed.  I learned a lot about some of the horrors of bio-chemical warfare.  Let us never forget.<br />I must say, however, I was really surprised that right at the beginning of this story upon finding the scientists dead, Demille wrote that the scientists had to be up to some harry-carry.  DeMille quickly moved the story along to prove that these scientists were not selling the USA out to the enemy but were seeking fortune through another less threaten route.  I learned a good bit about lost/found treasures and how one can become the rightful owner.
B00000J7J4|4.0|Santana's smash hit release &quot;Supernatural&quot; is flying off shelves everywhere!  It's the best CD from a solo artist I've ever listened too.  Problem is, it's too long.  No foul language, and great solos.
B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club is an odd film. It's visually and styilistically impressive. There are many great shots, like when the main charecter is seen walking through a catalouge, or the entertainment brought by the icey cavern and the penguin who encourages Norton to &quot;slide!&quot; And the sciript is full of great lines, like tyler's well done prophesy of the new world order<br />However, the film falls on some levels. The goal of Durden makes the movie seem somewhat pretentious. And the film just has a somewhat, &lt;i&gt;wrong&lt;/i&gt; feel to it, in an indescribable way. Of course, that could have been what they sought<br />However the style of the film is great.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I advise everyone to buy this amazin CD <BR>Tenacious D r the best thing since blink-182<BR>i rate it 5 stars , it rocks
B000002KE2|4.0|This is THE best Black Sabbath ever did in the studio. If you want some serious hard rock and withOUT all the devil [stuff] of the first album or 'evil' bat-eating Ozzy antics of the later albums...buy THIS one. Some good old fashioned British style 70s rock and roll. Trust me.
B0000009S3|5.0|you can't beat hot rats when it comes to guitar solos and other instrumental songs. hot rats isn't completely instrumental. willie the pimp, the second song, has lyrics sung by captain beefheart (before he and zappa went their separate ways because of beefheart's complaining that zappa marketed him like a \\"freak\\"...grow up beefheart). however, beefheart is at his finest here and he finishes the lyrics within the first 2 1/2 minutes of the 9 minute song. after that, the rest of the album is filled the best instrumentals, guitar solos and rock-jazz fusions that were ever recorded by zappa or anyone else for that matter. forget lumpy gravy, uncle meat, burnt weeny sandwich, weasles ripped my flesh, waka/jawaka, and the grand wazoo....the musical compositions on those albums are second-rate compared to the ones heard on hot rats. but to market and sell those grade b albums, they had to name them very odd titles so curiosity would lead the listener to buy the albums. don't let those titles fool you. hot rats is a simple and relevant title to the album (it's what willie sells)and all of the tracks put together on those 6 albums mentioned above can't compare to the 6 magnificent tracks on hot rats. so skip the grade b stuff and get right to the best. if you're like me and most people, you don't have enough money to buy all of zappa's 60 + albums, bootlegs and compilations. so to fully capture zappa at his instrumental best, hot rats is the place to go.
B00003CXXI|5.0|Shrek is a must see for the entire family.  We have it on VHS and DVD.  My husband, daughter and I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it and laugh the whole way through.  I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000005ITX|5.0|Okay, I know that some of the lyrics are fairly dumb, but behind the hippie cliches Arthur Lee's songs are original and concise acid-inspired folk rock masterpieces. Bryan Maclean also contributes two classics, the cheesy but nice \\"Old Man\\" and the timeless \\"Alone Again Or\\" which features the highly perceptive line: \\"I could be in love with almost everyone and I will be alone again tonight\\" perfectly describing the injustice of loneliness and using a mega hippy cliche' to original use. On \\"Da Cap\\", the previous love album, Lee had shouted, grunted and yelled far to often. Here he is much less embarrassing. There are no lyrics with quite the same level of amusing oafishness as \\"Da Capo\\"'s \\"7&7 is\\" ( \\"You can thrill me if you want to because I'm a bone and I go boom bip bip boom bip bip yeah!\\") but the wonderful \\"Bummer in the Summer\\" offers us \\"I'll be thinking of your mama when your thinking of another man\\". <BR>\\"Forever Changes\\" may be dated and naive but who cares when it's such an enjoyable and refreshing thing to listen to? Great expressive string arrangments, chiming guitars and multi-influenced melodies. \\"Andmoragain\\" is clearly one of the best songs written EVER. Come on! Buy the album! Whoever you are, don't listen to what Lou Reed says about West coast music, just listen to Lou Reed. And This.
1558908382|4.0|Smart, fun, and downright violent as times, this dark comedy was co-produced by John Cusack himself. . . The film fits his reserved image well.  The internal conflict within the lead character is great.  The Cusack character's psychologist is hilarious.  And Joan Cusack is always a great sidekick to her brother. Overall character interaction is strange. . . but in an absolutly hillarious fashion. Good movie, well worth the money, and fun to watch with a group, Gross Pointe Blank is quality.
014028009X|4.0|you know what they say, the book is better than the movie. in this case, the old saying rings true. (even though i enjoyed the movie version as well...)<br />i can only say that these pages are more entertaining and its a shame that on screen they didnt develope the funniest character -Bridget's boss at the tv studio. i laughed outloud while reading and was disappointed to see his role was overlooked in the theater. <br />i had fun reading this book and i think you will too!
B00000IQC8|4.0|The film that introduced us to Jay and Silent Bob, brought writer/directer Kevin Smith to the forefront.  This movie is brilliantly witty and criminally vulgar.  Above all else it is hilarious.  Brian O'Halleron's character Dante plays a great loser. Dante and Randall are great at debating the most pointless things.  It is also funny to see the placement of this film in the series of Kevin Smith movies as they are all inter-related. Well worth the money, and damn funny, this is a must have for anyone who likes sarcastic comedy or has liked any other Kevin Smith movie.
0316776963|5.0|this was recommended to me by a friend and it was my first exposure to david sedaris. if you've never heard of david, you may have heard of his sister amy who plays &quot;jerry blank&quot; on the comedy central show, &quot;strangers with candy.&quot; if you like her humor, you'll definitly love davids books. <BR>i never laughed outloud so much from reading. his stories are, for the most part, nonfictional tales of his off-beat life. scattered and out of order, each chapter is an adventure in and of itself. <br />if you're thinking of buying this book, do yourself a favor and order the other 3 as well. &quot;holidays on ice,&quot; &quot;barrel fever,&quot; and &quot;naked&quot; are just as crazy and entertaining.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.  The character interaction between the Burnham family is spectacular.  The entire cast is absolutly wonderful.<br />Kevin Spacey did what all people wish they could do. . . Take back their life and reclaim their youth from the soul-sucking monotony that is everyday suberbia, and a lousy job. Trade in the Camry for a '69 Camaro, it'll save your soul.  <br />Ditracters of this film only dislike it because their lives are too much like it. They realize that they are stuck in a job and life that they do not want and see themselves unable to do what Spacey does in the film. This movie makes you want to live life in the moment, I cannot think of any other movie that has that kind of effect.
0671027344|5.0|this is the best book ive ever read and if i could, id buy copies for everyone on earth. <br />its short, full of emotion and superb-delicious-intense-great-and-wonderful-fantastic writing! follow the main character Charlie as he enters his first year of high school and experiences new things for the first time. he writes letters to no one (the reader) and you get to watch as his story unfolds into somewhat of a surprise ending. (i didnt even catch on to it the first time i read it and i still loved the book. the second time around i finally understood what had happened and it was like reading it for the first time all over again.) <br />charlie is a wallflower and you will fall in love with him and the way his mind works. i promise.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|this is a great movie which tells a tale of a downward spiral of people hooked on drugs. it is depressing and thought provoking at the same time. i cannot stress enough that if people liked this movie then they should definitely read donald goines's \\"dopefiend,\\" a book about heroin addicts which is very similar if not worse than the one's portrayed in the movie.
B000053VAF|5.0|This movie is funny as hell,it mite not be the best Kevin Smith movie but it's still [very good].Jay(Jason Mewes)and Silent Bob(Kevin Smith)are funneier in this than any other Kevin Smith movie,....There is a lot of language in it but that's what makes it funny.This movie is hallarious.<br />  Dogmas got a sweet DVD too.It's got sweet deleted scenes that I personaley think the editor's should have kept in the movie,some are funny as hell and some have nudity.It's got some cool Special Features and two disc's,well the special edition does anyway.Rent it,see it,like it,buy it,I did.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|While this DVD falls short of the amazement that is last year's DVD release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, my review will not concentrate on that. Also, this has something over Snow White: there are three presentations of the film. I will go over these and some of my favorite features in this review.<br />First, the three versions: Special Edition, Original Theatrical Release, and Work In Progress Edition.<br />The first version is the Special Edition, which was restored and remastered and re-shot with enhanced animation for IMAX and large-screen theaters with the \\"Human Again\\" sequence added in as well.<br />The second version is the original theatrical version. You know, the same film we've seen for the last 11 years. Perfect for those who think the Special Edition sucks.<br />The third, and possibly, my favorite version is the Work In Progress Edition. This was shown in October 1991 @ the New York Film Festival because they had requested a showing, yet the film was unfinished. There's a lot of scenes that are mostly or ALL in pencil animation, some parts are put together with storyboards, some with a mix of fully inked and painted animation, storyboard sketches, and/or rough/cleaned up pencil animation. It's really cool, you get to see some of the work involved in the creative process of the film. My only fault is that they added the finished score to it and replaced the colored scenes in the actual film with ones from the restored version. The score was not finished at the time, as is told in the \\"A High-Profile Review\\" featurette on Disc 2. I would have really liked to see it the way it was shown, dull colors, incomplete score, and all. But it's still satisfying.<br />Some of my favorite features on Disc 2 include the virtual galleries, which I was glad to see as those were my favorite features from the Snow White DVD. I also enjoyed all the trailers and TV spots and promotional galleries as well. Mrs. Potts Personality Test is a winner for all ages. *I got Lumiere.* I also enjoyed seeing the camera tests, Early Presentation Reel, the alternate version of Be Our Guest sung to Maurice instead of Belle, (And let's thank God they decided to go with Belle.) and the demo of Human Again set to storyboard sketches.<br />All in all, it may fall just a bit short of Snow White's amazement, but BATB still has a uniqueness of its own. It's still my favorite Disney movie of all time, and I love it now more than when I first saw it 10 years ago, as I now have a finer appreciation of the animated picture, everything that goes into it, the styles each film has, and the deeper meaning of the story. This DVD is a MUST have for any DVD collection, if only for the 3 versions of the film. I suggest you view all 3. Even if you HAVE the 1992 video release with the original theatrical version, I still suggest you see it in its newly restored glory, the Special Edition, also restored with the Human Again sequence, and the Work In Progress version for serious film buffs who like to see what kind of work goes into making a film.
B0000073BG|4.0|Look folks, a lot of you people dont give a hoot about this kind of music, but those that do -- computer specialists, doctors of therapy, historical scribes, journalists of note   who love music, must understand that this particular LP (ha!) is a brilliant display of classical/rock/mind trip music that was (in my case) seen as more of a diversion  than an art form by those who could never listen to Led Zepelin.  Do I like this record?  Yes, I find it stimulating and inspirational.  Is it good?  No, its profound.  But, you see, Renaissance is profound in its pop presentations of singularly striking musical presentations, and, yes, I tried very hard not to make my musical review sound ponderous.  After all, that was the main complaint of this music at the time.  We (then) were aware of the criticism of this music.  And now, some decades later, we need only to listen again to see if we, or they, were correct.  I have to say that Renaissance is as fresh and inspirational today as it was in 1975.   I miss the challenge this kind of music offered.  I miss the depth this kind of music provided.  Why should music be superficial?  Why should music be vapid?  I am no wiser now, but older, and I miss the intellectual concepts offered by \\"pop\\" music of that time.  Children, buy this for your father.  Father, buy this for your children.   Lets not forget that pop didn't mean fluff.  Rather, it meant contemporary.
0316666343|1.0|The idea of the story being told from the vantage point of a murder victim in heaven was very creative and the reason I bought the book.  Unfortunately, that was the only positive about the it.<br />As far as the \\"believability\\" of the book, I cannot agree more with the review from \\"Psychologist from Michigan\\".  The characters and story in this book are pathetically unrealistic.  I can't say this any stronger.  As the book wore on, I kept shaking my head in frustration and looking to see how many pages I had left to endure and hoping for a good ending.<br />Unfortunately, the frustration continued as the ending was another huge disappointment.  To say the ending was anti-climatic and overly unbelievable is an understatement.  I read 300 pages for that pile of trash ending?  <br />The author is someone who came up with a creative idea to write a book, but doesn't have the skill to write a good book.  This was a big dissappointment and I do not recommend it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|As others have said, the movie is recapped enough around here, so I won't delve in to it too much. I must admit, I'm not a big Anime fan. I like Cowboy Bebop a lot, Kiki's Delivery Service was cute and sweet (without being on the sappy, too-cutesy side of things) and I can handle bits of Ranma at a time. But this movie is unquestionably one of the good examples of the genre called \\"Anime.\\" I just saw this movie for a second time, since it was running cheaper during the day, and at a closer look, there is a lot more going on here than initally seen. The music is fantastic: many times it is simply a piano playing over animation, sans voice (IMHO, the most memorable being the opening and ending theme, as well as the scene where Chihiro is on the train). No one is subjected to any real singing or musical numbers. (There's a very short ditty sung for a monster/spirit that is all of 15 seconds.) The characters translated well into English.<br />My only (minor -- very, very minor) issues would be the inclusion of characters, notably the Radish Spirit, that seem to have little reason to exist in the movie. I still can't find out why Lin looked so nervous to see this Spirit, and how it factored into the movie. But, that may be just a place where translating this to a western audience was not going to work. However the director never ends up looking like he is simply trying to show off with is detail-rich scenes, and off-the-wall minor characters (where some people seem to want to come out and yell at us \\"See how clever we are?? See?? Over there! Isn't that artsy??\\"), but rather is trying to give us the same experience a young, terrified Chihiro would have.<br />Overall, this is one I can't wait to have on DVD. This movie never speaks down to it's audience, so I hope someone over at Disney or Dreamworks is taking notes.
B0000639FE|3.0|Bought this DVD cause we love the movie and thought the extras would be worth the extra dollars (over the standard DVD release). <br />The main reason we bought it was for the audio commentary. Unlike other movies where this has provided great insight into the movie and the actors, this commentary is more like a reunion of actors that haven't been told they are being recorded. There are huge gaps of silence followed by comments such as &quot;I love this bit&quot; and &quot;this bit was great&quot; and fits of giggles.<br />It is a huge waste! They obviously haven't watched other DVDs to understand the value-add they could have provided to the viewer.<br />The other extras are OK (the Rod Tidwell ad is really cool and the deleted scenes are interesting) but even the commentary around some of these stinks.<br />Don't get us wrong - we still love the movie in all ways but don't waste the extra dollars if a good commentary is what you are looking for.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Fabulous and a bargain too!  Love Princes of the Universe from Highlander, I Want It All, of course the 70's stuff.
B00005QGAT|5.0|When Michael Jackson and Quincy Jones teamed up to record the 1979 album \\"Off the Wall,\\" I doubt they knew what kind of beast they were about to create. Spawning four Top Ten singles including two Number Ones, \\"Off the Wall\\" blasted into the Top Ten and gave Jackson his biggest solo success at the time. But chart domination aside, the album is a classic collection of funk and disco-laced soul that holds up amazing well today. His magical voice breathed life into infectious hits like \\"Don't Stop til You Get Enough\\" and \\"Rock With You.\\" He also cruises effortlessly through the hyperactive \\"Working Day and Night\\" and the blazing title track. But Jackson, I think, triumphs best on \\"She's Out of My Life.\\" If tossed into the hands of a lesser singer, this song would have been a disastrous sapfest of maple syrup sentiment, but it's Jackson's delivery that makes this song a genuine \\"she-just-dumped-me\\" ballad. Three years later, he would return to the scene with a little album called \\"Thriller\\" which sold, oh, maybe a few million copies worldwide. But \\"Off the Wall\\" should be credited as the album that put Michael on the map as an adult solo star, and it holds up as a verified classic.
0790729725|5.0|This movie is a must see for everyone.I watched it at my friends house on Movie Centeral Ardreniline drive.I am 10 years old and I love the parts where Pesci goes around killing people(He does that in every movie he acts.)Robert de Niero is the hottest!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now that it s on dvd its even better .the sound track really stands out now .it really a fun film to watch the film looks better now on dvd makes video tape  look bad . i would recommed buying this dvd if you really like this film or have not seen it yet after 20years GREASE IS STILL THE WORD !!!
B00004TH7Z|3.0|In the old days I loved Maiden as much as anyone but they should have hanged it up ten years ago. If you must reunite for old time's sake at least dump that hack Gers. Murray and Smith's playing flowed together like magic. Gers sticks around like a leech and destroys the chemistry with the worst lead guitar playing ever recorded.<BR>Some tracks are okay and bring you back to the good old days but music has evolved and changed so much since then. Maiden has not. Same old stuff. You can't go home again.
B00006JK1R|3.0|The inevitable sequel to the immensely popular MEN IN BLACK is on DVD, and while the film isn't as good as the original, the DVD extras are impressive. Like most Hollywood sequels, the tired \\"Bigger is Better\\" rule applies here (Somebody has to throw that old Hollywood \\"How-To\\" book in the bin). However there is much fun to be had throughout the somewhat un-original plot. Will Smith, returning to the comedy side of things after Michael Mann's ALI, gives another \\"I ain't touchin' that thing!\\" performance. And Tommy Lee Jones returns as straight-faced Agent K after getting his memory re-inserted to save manikind from the threat of alien invasion. It's fun, yes, but not as good as it could have been. At least it's better than WILD WILD WEST.<br />The DVD extras make up for it though, with a substantial amount of extras on the second dic of the 2 Disc set. Starting off with a Director Commentary, 14 (!) Production Featurettes, Alternate Ending, the predictable Will Smith music video, Multi-Angle Deconstructions, Blooper Reel, DVD-rom content, Marketing Campaigns and trailers.
B00000BKE1|2.0|\\"No Prayer For the Dying\\" was the last quality Maiden album. Even though they sounded old and tired every song was decent. \\"Fear\\" is a total hit and miss affair. A first for Maiden. A crack in the armour that has only gotten worse since the unspeakable horror that is Blaze or whatever that singer's name is. Don't even get me started on Gers. The biggest long haired [person] that ever strapped on a guitar. Not only are his guitar solos utterly horrific he is the worst heavy metal performer in history bar none. Prancing around the stage like a long haired ballerina in tennis shoes. I saw them on this tour and the arena was half full. In the 80's the same arena was so packed you couldn't move<BR>an inch. Alas, a sign of the times. Nirvana and Co. single handedly destroyed our beloved 80's metal. Bruce saw the writing on the wall and bailed out just in time. BTW, his solo albums are<BR>light years ahead of the [stuff] Maiden put out after this one.
B0000640SB|5.0|Barry Sonnenfeld's Sci Fi comedy blockbuster starring Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones is one of the most purely entertaining films of the 90s. The premise, taken from the DC comics is simple, yet an excellent choice considering the talent behind the project and the possibility (now reality) of a new and exciting franchise.<br />With the superb comic duo of Smith and Jones (As agents K and J respectively) and an inventive take on Sci Fi cliches, added with well-played wit and charm, it's effortless coolness is just right. Jones' dry persona in the film, combined with Smith's jibes, is one of the best buddy parings since Newman and Redford. The supporting cast including Rip Torn as head honcho \\"Z\\" and Linda Florentino are great, and extra kudos for Vincet D'Onfrio as the bug in the \\"edgar suit\\".<br />Danny Elfman's Batman-esche score adds a nice layer of comic adventure. And extra kudos for FX maestro Rick Baker's award-winning alien creations. All of the seamless combinations of ILM and practical effects are literally out-of-this-world. The audacious concept that aliens are living among us (disguised as humans) provides for some humerous moments, including an alien observer screen that shows that MIB-producer Steven Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone (among others) are extra-terrestrials. Ok, so it's somewhat of a re-tread of GHOSTBUSTERS in some caveats, and it dosn't even pretend to have depth. But hey, the universal question pervades: Who cares? With comedy this good, it's minor flaws can be ignored. Building on it's endless comic potential to a satisfying showdown, MIB will no doubt linger long in anyone's memory, regardless of if you've been nuetralised.<br />But for cryin' out loud! Yet another re-re-release of the MEN IN BLACK DVD. However for all the jaded people who, knowledged by the usual re-release pattern so common in many DVDs (MATRIX, LORD OF THE RINGS et all) decided to wait for a better edition of MIB, then here's the best one to get. With enough extras to satisfy fans, this \\"Deluxe Edition\\" has it all. A 2 Disc set, the extras include a Commentary by director Barry Sonnenfeld, Rick Baker and the team at ILM, a featurette and trailer from Men In Black 2 a scene editing workshop, Creatures: Concept to Creation, Music video, Storyboard comparisons, Conceptual art gallery, Multi-angle scene deconstructions, Original featurette, Character animation studies, Extended and alternate scenes and trailers (Phew!). The picture and sound quality are top-notch too. Very impressive stuff, and one of the many reasons you junked your VHS collection yonks ago. And altogether, a 5-star DVD. But then, in a couple of months, a DVD 2 Pack of MIB and MIB 2 might pop up...satisfy fans, this \\"Deluxe Edition\\" has it all.

B00005JKG5|4.0|Flashdance for the 80's was what the original French film La Femme Nikita was for the 90's. Both films presented us with very stylish (almost smoky and noirish)atmospheres and intelligent sensual women in the lead...The soundtrack I have owned in 3 formats over the years (first tape, then vinyl, now c.d.). The music was the pinnacle or the point beyond disco and other musical pop styles or fads that came before it !<br />Director Adrian Lyne's sense of style was the culmination of what the early 80's MTV era was all about without ever compromising quality or artisitic integrity. His work never bordered on cheapness or rip offs. Flashdance was an original...<br />This is a great stylish film from the 80's for good ol' memories' sake and nothing more.It's almost a guilty pleasure. For those offended by this film for portraying women in a bad light, please do yourselves a favor and just don't watch it !Don't expect anything deep or revealing other than the music, dancing, and the ladies wearing very little...
B00006IUL7|5.0|Christopher Nolan's follow-up to MEMENTO is a more straight-forward thriller which serves as both an excellent tour-de-force of suspense in terrific form and re-establishment of Robin Williams' serious acting roles. But the main guy here is of course, the great Al Pacino, who gives another fantatsically compelling performance. The story, basically, is centered around Pacino hunting down a serial killer on the loose (Williams). Hey, at least Williams is breaking away from his &quot;funnyman&quot; sterotype and proves, at least with this, that he can be serious and still bring the same commanding M.O to any character on film. Hillary Swank also provides impressive supporting energy, helped with a sharp script. Not surprisingly, the score, very important addition in this genre, is a fantastic blend of slighty etheral tracks with downbeat percussions building up the tension. Director Nolan, having proven his coup-de-grace with the intracate stylistic MEMENTO, here works in more familiar action territory. That's not to say that the film is bereft of twists however, for there are numerous shockers and suprises along the way. A terrific film, and a must have on DVD.<br />Speaking of which, the DVD extra features are fantastic, with an interesting commentary by director Christopher Nolan, commentary by actor Hilary Swank, production designer Nathan Crowley, editor Dody Dorn, cinematograher Wally Pfister, and screenwriter Hillary Seitz, additional scene with commentary the doco &quot;Day for Night&quot; making of documentary, &quot;180 Degrees&quot;: A Conversation with Christopher Nolan and Al Pacino, &quot;In the Fog&quot;: Cinematography and production design and &quot;Eyes Wide Open&quot;: The insomniac's world. Also included are trailers and stills gallery. Very impressive.

But of course this very practice was started on a wide scale by the Japanese in the 1930s.  <br />The lack of attention paid in the West to Japanese war crimes <BR>in the WWII era is probably due to racism.  There was hatred<BR>among Americans and Australians for the way the Japanese treated<BR>POWs, but the brutal treatment of the Japanese towards Asian populations was overlooked.  The fact is that Japanese war crimes against Asian civilian populations were as brutal and widespread as the Germans' atrocities in Russia and Eastern Europe.<br />Iris Chang barely mentions the Japanese rape of Manilla or the treatment of POWs in her book.  Had she wanted to write a more damning book on Japan, there was plenty of material for her to draw from.  Instead she wrote a restrained, hearfelt work of  history which will endure as long as there are readers who respect truth.
B000060MY6|4.0|This is a film I couldn't stop watching.  It is dark, disturbing and gripping.  Too bad it doesn't make sense.  This 2001 film directed by David Lynch won all sorts of awards and he even got an Academy Award nomination. To enjoy it though, one has to suspend all sense of logic and reality, and just plain experience the surrealist dreamscape in the form of a dark Hollywood film noir that it is intended to be.  You have to look at it as a very modern piece of art and throw away your expectations about conventional storytelling to really appreciate this mystery that never gets solved.<br />There is a sort of plot.  A young starry eyed Hollywood hopeful played by Naomi Watts is planning on staying in her aunt's empty apartment while she goes on auditions with dreams of becoming a great actress.  The apartment is not empty, however.  A mysterious dark haired woman, has just walked away from the scene of an accident and has wandered in there, not remembering who she is or what has happened.  The two women become friends, and their relationship develops as they search for the dark haired woman's identity. But then there are surreal scenes of murders and intimidation, including a director who is pressured into hiring an actress by some weird surreal murder threats.  Seemingly kind people turn ghoulish, there are dire warnings of trouble, and both actresses wind up playing a variety of roles. It all seems like a horrible dream, and indeed it is.  I yearned for a satisfactory conclusion, but as the film went on, it just got murkier and murkier.<br />Although I can understand some of the artistry, this film was a little too weird for my taste.  I like my stories to have a beginning, a middle and an end, thank you.  And Mulholland Drive doesn't even come close.  It played with my emotions and then let me down.  Recommended for the brave and experimental only.
B00006J3WH|4.0|I missed the 6th season episode this album was based on, it would very likely have been better if I'd been able to see it as a companion piece. <BR>As others have said, the songs cover a wide range and the cast display a wide range of singing talent. Amber Benson is great on &quot;Under your spell&quot;, James Marsters does very well(sounding like the American he is to me), especially on &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;, Anthony Head sings as well as ever. Nicholas Brendon mostly talks his way through his bits (were they chosen for that sort of talent range?)while Emma Caulfield is good on her &quot;Bunnies&quot; segment. I wish I could hear more of Alyson Hannigan, what little of her that comes through really sounds Willow like, can't tell if she can sing. Sarah Michelle Gellar could make a singer with practice. Joss Whedon and wife Kai Cole aren't bad either.<BR>There are just a few instrumental pieces near the end, from earlier seasons. I consider #22 Sacrifice (from &quot;The Gift&quot;) to be the best of these.
0800139151|4.0|This 1995 film is certainly not to be taken seriously.  It's a western that's a spoof of westerns and sure is enjoyable. There's a big name cast - Sharon Stone as the avenged lady gunfighter, Gene Hackman as the cruel boss of the town, Leonardo DiCaprio as the son of the boss, and Russell Crowe as a former gunfighter turned preacher.  There's a big contest going on, with pairs of gunfighters fighting to the death until there's no one left standing.  And plenty of action as yet another poor loser bites the dust.  Cinematography is excellent and so is the directing.  This is the typical western town etched in all of our minds.  But the characters use some modern slang.  And Sharon Stone wears designer sun glasses.  The acting is good and the story moved fast.  It held my interest throughout and I recommend it as good escape viewing.
B000002I2I|5.0|Invites you in for a draught at Morrison Hotel.  It is a raucous roadhouse filled with blues, driving rock and darkly poetic images.  Don't go into the corners of Morrison Hotel and watch for hidden passages.<br />The Doors star was ascendant when they  released Morrison Hotel. The band composed of members, Robbie Krieger on guitar, Ray Manzarek on keyboards, John Densmore on Drums and Jim Morrison on vocals were known for their carnival sound and poetic songs. Their leader, the charismatic singer and performer Jim Morrison's mojo was rising in 1970.  He was at his peak creatively , but less than one year later he met his end in a Parisian bathtub.  Somehow Morrison Hotel with it's darkness and rock driven beat retains the strange twisted feelings of the politics and events of the day and age while still being relevant to current events and times.<br />The cd launches with a drive with Jim Morrison to the Road House Blues:<br />Keep your eyes on the road<br />Your hands upon the wheel<br />We're going to the roadhouse<br />We're gonna have a real ...good time<br />Good times according to Morrison is getting up in the morning and searching for a beer.<br />The album shift gears between songs from fast paced rock and blues to slower poetic ballads.  Krieger, Manzarek and Densmore are at their best musically.  This is some hard rocking stuff which showcases each of their skills nicely, form the guitar solos of Roadhouse Blues, to the driving drumbeat of You Make Me Real to the superb piano of The Spy.<br />Perhaps the song most reflective of the tone of the album is the oddly titled Peace Frog a hard driving rock with visions of destruction which is intertwined with Morrison's poetry.  The lyrics reveal the lie of the upbeat rock:<br />Blood in the streets its up to my ankles<br />Blood in the streets its up to my knees<br />Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago.<br />It was a strange time and Morrison Hotel is an excellent and intriguing musical commentary of the times.  I loved it then and I love it still.mes.  I loved it then and I love it still.
0553278398|5.0|Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; was fortunately the first work I ever read from this master writer. My expectations were more than fulfilled.<br />The main character is Hari Seldon who possesses a rudimentary mathematical framework for predicting future events. His problem is living in a universe where there are 25 million planets  and trying to take the massive amount of information from each to make a reliable model from which to predict the future. Seldon is aided by Hummin who helps transport him across the planet and Dors, a historian, who try to keep Seldon and his ideas from being seized. Seldon gradually refines his approach to predicting the future, leading Seldon (and the reader) to a great many surprises about the many whom he trusted along the way.<br />Asimov creates a complex plot which could have easily unraveled, but he ties all loose ends together in this skillful and brilliant novel. A must read for anyone interested in science fiction!
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie has been pondered enough.  I just wanted to state that it contains some of the finest acting I've ever witnessed and I didn't even know it.<br />The performance of &quot;Crying&quot; is incredible and worth owning this dvd just for that.<br />This isn't a movie for people that need to have everything spelled out for them.  You may actually have to think for yourself.  Something American audiences aren't used to.

B00005JG6R|5.0|When I first bought Akira, it was for three reasons. One was my absolute hatred for most Walt Disney movies, my love for anime, and the fact that I love weirdness. Hearing my close friends talk about a biker gang running over a kid with a face of an old man really appeals to me. So I went out and bought it...<BR> I didn't dare buy the English dubbed version. Dubbed versions will NEVER give you the \\"true\\"  and \\"original\\"  feel of the movie, so I took the one with subtitles. Watched it, and fell in love WITH EVERY SINGLE ASPECT OF IT.<BR> If there's a flaw in Akira, I didn't see it. The animation was perfectly done, the story line was intense, and...humanity bleeds through every single one of the characters. As tough as Kaneda may be, he still shed tears for Yamagata, another one of his biking friends that the mutilatedTetsuo had killed.  Kei may seem like your average warrior (oops - I meant terrorist)  lady, but she still screams and shows fear. And Tetsuo - at the very brink of his helplessness, he screams for...surprise, surprise, help. <BR> The story line isn't as confusing as it seems. Reading subtitles and watching it twice will help.<BR> Another thing to toast about Akira would be the MUSIC! The Akira theme song, is...there's no earthly word to describe it. It's a type I've never heard before. It's neither modern, nor classical, nor New Age, nor tribal....it's almost a rare mixture between heavy metal, techno, choral, tribal...it's very strange, yet at the same time, delightful and exciting to the ear.<BR> There's lots of blood and gore in this anime - but it's all tastefully done. The blood and gore's there for a purpose - without it, the story wouldn't be complete. It's not just violence and blood for the heck of it...it's there for a reason. But it's still not a family film. The scene where Tetsuo's girlfriend nearly gets raped by one of the Clown bike gang members isn't exactly pretty to watch - and when Akira's power inside Tetsou is revealed - I'm of legal age to watch it, and it scares me. Thankfully, growing up around manga and anime helped me sleep when night came.<BR> Akira - you won't be dissapointed.
0385484518|4.0|While I don't necessarily agree with everything (i.e. the philosophy of) espoused in this book, I have, nonetheless, gleaned many lessens about life from its pages. This book is an emotional and intellectual ride with Morris Schwartz (late Professor of Sociology at Brandeis University). This is a record, of sorts, about his last few months of life, his thoughts about life and certain things in life such as marriage, regrets, the perfect day, money, love, forgiveness, etc.<br />Mitch Albom has a great writing style, simple but yet detailed, descriptive and emotive. There is much wisdom in these pages, much emotion, much love, much grief, much warmth, much compassion, much courage, much experience, much mentoring, much teaching, and the list could go on. I find it interesting that when I see famous people in interviews and they are asked to reveal who has had the most influence in their lives up to that point, most make mention of a school teacher. Morrie was such a person - one who had much influence.  This book will move you to tears and cause you to laugh. It is quite easy to read and you could probably finish it in about an hour or so, but in that hour your life will be changed in one way or another having read these pages.
B00006G8K0|4.0|I have not even opened the package for this classic film from Hammer Studios - because I can not get past some obvious errors and bad choices on the packaging of the DVD from Warner.  First, this film has always been considered a classic movie with fine production, acting and script components.  <br />So why is the outside of the front cover listing the film as Christopher Lee's \\"Fang-tastic\\", first ever, etc...???  I take umbrage with the use of this explotative term, that I would coin for an Abbott and Costello movie.  And why would they use such a ... cover poster.  Dracula does not even look like Christopher Lee.  Fo course the last error is the obvious glitch on the back cover, which I don't need to mention again here...
B00003CX8Y|4.0|Definitely one of the best animated films ever made. Most of the special features are a welcome addition, except for the scene \\"Human Again\\" in the SE version of the film. All of a sudden, the Prince/Beast can't read??!! Why does he have such an extensive library? Pathetic addition. The animation/song for the scene itself is also poor. It does not fit it as well as Disney would like you to believe. The animation for certain things is different (see through curtains, loads of animated nonsense, etc which are not present in such a strong way in the rest of the film). The animation is somewhat different, and \\"characters\\" added don't seem to fit in-- their faces are somewhat goofy/generic. 4/5 for the rest of everything else, but no 5/5. (...)
B0000630BT|2.0|I don't know if Priest were trying to compete with the likes of Megadeth or Metallica, but this is definately Priest with a new direction.  I'll focus on the pro's, first.  Enter Scott Travis.  He really pounds the hell out of his kit!  With his intensity, it's as if Priest turned into a speed metal act.  Even K.K. and Glen crank up the intensity with killer guitar playing.  For instance, listen to the rhythm playing on an older song, say, \\"Heading out to the Highway\\", and compare it to the rhythm guitar playing on any of the songs from Painkiller.  But I'm not sure that their speed metal direction is a good thing or not.  I prefer the less obnoxiously-intense songs like, \\"Hell Patrol\\", \\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\\", and \\"A Touch of Evil\\".  Here's the con's.  A lot of the c.d. sounds TOO intense and just plain ridiculous!  Judas Priest always tried too hard to force the metal image!  (They'd probably say, \\"It's not an image; it's a way of life!\\").  I have a Painkiller concert video, and it's funny to see them with MORE studs, MORE leather, and those STOO-PID custom guitars!  But let's get back to the music.  The lyrics are embarassing!  \\"Feeling those tendons rip!\\"  My favorite part is during the spoken part on Night Crawler.  \\"WHILE IT FEASTS ON FLESH AND BLOOD!!!\\"  I've played that part for a dozen or so people, and everytime I play it, people just die laughing.  If you want a HEAVY c.d., I recommend \\"Accident of Birth\\" or \\"The Chemical Wedding\\", by Bruce Dickinson.
B000067CPX|5.0|By discarding the sock-adorned genitalia gimmick, and slap-bass heavy funk obsessions, and then discovered mellow harmonised music, Red Hot Chili Peppers have now made in my opinion their greatest album to date, reflected in the fact that they are enjoying arguably their highest level of popularity to date.<br />1. By The Way<BR>One of those songs that sounds anonymous the first 2 or 3 times, then suddenly becomes brilliant. Some might say a typical Chilis song, but the harmonised verse and shotgun delivery of the lightning rap interludes seperate this from the rap/rock guff.<BR>A definite *****<br />2. Universally Speaking<BR>A great bouncing rhythm right through this track, you cannot help but nod ya head (no black suits comin'). Fairly generic verses, but Kiedis comes into his own on the chorus.<BR>****<br />3. This Is The Place<BR>A more slower tempo for this one, it is almost like a follow-up to Under the Bridge. Another strong chorus makes this a distinctive track, together with Flea's consistently brilliant bass.<BR>****<br />4. Dosed<BR>Not a favourite among the more rap/funk centralised Chilis fans, this is one of the highlights of the album. Showing how love has mellowed his outlooked, Anthony Kiedis' vocals are beutifully matched by the melodic, swooping guitar play by John Frusciante<BR>*****<br />5. Don't Forget Me<BR>One of the more anonymous tracks on the album, that is not to detract from the track, more a reflection in the overall album.<BR>***<br />6. The Zephyr Song<BR>The second single to be lifted, a more upbeat song, with an almost rap-like sung verse, and another melodic chorus. The middle eight makes the song stand out however. Bear in mind, the lyrics make no sense however. Brilliant gibberish<BR>****<br />7. Can't Stop<BR>The second typical Chili song, with a fantastic start, building up to a heavy crescendo, before the shotgun rapping kicks in, interspersed by the sung chorus. Reminiscent of Around the World in structure, and that is no bad thing.<BR>****<br />8. I Could Die For You<BR>Like Don't Forget Me, another of the more inconspicuous tracks, maybe a little slow for it's position on the album.<BR>**<br />9. Midnight<BR>A strings-heavy song, with a soaring chorus. The harmonising between Kiedis and Frusciante really brings home the influences of bands such as the Mamas and the Papas.<BR>***<br />10. Throw Away Your Television<BR>Another of the more funk orientated tracks, this may please the more old-school fans, but I found it quite unremarkable.<BR>**<br />11. Cabron<BR>A definite break from the norm, and one of the songs that defines this past summer for me. It is a definite highlight, as a bright and breezy flamenco vibe makes this one of the best tracks on the album<BR>****<br />12. Tear<BR>A fantastic song, simply put. The melancholic verse leading into the powerful chorus, in a song reminiscent of the beach boys. One of the best pieces of music they have ever made.<BR>*****<br />13. On Mercury<BR>A more ska-punk song that wouldn't be out of place on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. As such, it doesn't seem to really fit with the rest of the album. Still top class though.<BR>***<br />14. Minor Thing<BR>The last great song on the album, it just kicks into life in a second, and is underway. A great verse and chorus, interspersed with an unintrusive rap bridge.<BR>****<br />15. Warm Tape<BR>16. Venice Queen<BR>Both of these songs are not really too memorable, hence stuck at the end of the album. Although decent tracks, they kind of fall back into the shadows when compared to the rest of the album.<br />** each
B00005R62K|5.0|Man, '70s metal just doesn't get any better than this!  You have excellent drumming (Exciter); awesome riffs (White Heat, Saints in Hell, and Heroes End); brilliant lead playing (all songs); and even an embellished cover (Better by you).  And although the intro to \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" sounds like Styx's \\"Madame Blue\\", it has one of Glenn Tipton's best guitar solos ever!  You can't go wrong if you buy this c.d.!
B000053VAF|5.0|Some explicit language and very violent some sexual humor, and dark funny. Once you get past this, you see that there is a message to this story. Not a deep one, just a tip or eye opener ...Kevin Smith once again exhibits his talent for writing spoken text. Ben Affleck pulls off a great emotional scene in what appears to be a parking garage, or sub part of a building...
0156012197|5.0|This book is a marvel of modern literiture.  It encompasses ideas of philosophers, like Plato, and great writers, like Tolstoy, while keeping the text and story simple enough to make a child giggle with delight.  You should buy this book, not only for you but for your family.  You should let all who have an imagination borrow it.  The more people who have read this classic the better.
0441003257|5.0|This really fun book does not need an additional review, but I had to put a rating in order to influence my amazon recommendations. I would love to read more books with that great sense of humor.
0375414053|4.0|I am a working woman who is thinking of becoming a working mother one day. Pearson's book put it all in perspective with that dry British humor. The book portrays the physical and mental struggles of juggling home and work. It does not neglect the needs of the mother as a woman also. Kate Reddy is the woman many aspire to be. The one who has it all but may die trying to keep it together. Pearson also goes deep beneath the surface to explore why  the character wants it all by going back to her own relationship with her mother.  At no time does the book become preachy or sappy. It is a straight forward, at times edgy and laugh out loud funny narration of what it takes to be a mom at home and to hang on to everything else you built up before the kids took over.
0792151712|2.0|There are so many reviews already, I need not go into much here. I am 40 yrs. old, mom to a 19, 10, and 4 yr. old. For 12 years we did not own a TV. It was a blessing in many ways, to be sure. Last year, we decided to get a video player (still no TV, still a blessing!), the main reason being I wanted to see some documentary videos on Elvis, whom I was studying at the time(I am not an Elvis fan; my mother was).Anyway, we then went through the Alfred Hitchcock classics, studying those, and recently I have discovered Fredric March (a GREAT actor, most popular in the 30's and 40's)and so now I have been studying Fredric films, and have seen over 35 to date. We love the old classics best, and waste little time on modern cinema offerings...so why did we watch the Titanic video?<br />Well, my mom, the Elvis fan, died 2 yrs. ago and my 19 yr. old brought home her Titanic video, even though at the time  we had no way to watch it. Finally, last night, I felt like seeing it, to see what the hype was all about (also I am out of Fredric March movies right now!)back in 1997.  <br />Overall: my opinion is that while it wasn't HORRIBLE or AWFUL or anything similar as other reviewers have called it, it wasn't really good either. It was just \\"okay\\".  I don't think modern movies can even come close to the old classics that Hollywood gave us back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's. Why?  It's hard to describe...there was more decency, more class, something. Sure, there were bad films and acting jobs back then too, but I don't think modern actors and actresses have what it takes anymore. In saying this, I go to Leo and Kate...I felt they were very shallow in their acting, I felt they were miscast. They were too modern, even in period clothes. Leo is not the romantic, manly, leading man the film needed. Kate was not the woman to portray the inner beauty, the inner turmoil, that I think the Rose character needed. Her hair color was VERY awful to me...honestly, it distracted me a lot during the movie! It was just too weird. Because these 2 were miscast, and because their acting abilities were lacking in depth and sincerity, I could not feel for them in the film, hope for them, or anything. And a good film is supposed to get you into the heart of the characters, and get you caring for them. None of this happened for me with Leo and Kate. I felt the characters on the whole were not developed...I think it would have helped to know more about Cal, and why he was as he was, and why he and Kate had gone this far in a relationship. I felt the supporting cast were not very good actors either...Molly Brown could have had a lot of potential, but it seemed the actress was not into the heart and skin of her character...like she was just parroting lines. I am not trying to be unkind here...I just feel disapointed when the characters appear as actors and do not become the characters. The only supporting actor who I felt \\"became\\" his character was Victor Garbor, who played Thomas Andrews. You could feel his feelings along with him. And along with this, I say that the dialog seemed too modern for the most part...the people spoke 90's lingo a lot. Better writing would have helped here.<br />I was mildly offended at the crude language throughout this film...believe me, you CAN enjoy a film without everyone speaking gutter language. I couldn't believe even old Rose had a bad mouth! The bad language was a negative to this film. I also did not feel the nudity was necessary...Kate was beautiful, but noone but her husband and doctor need to see it! I did not appreciate the sex scene either...was totally not needed and anyway it was not like their love was beautiful and pure...it seemed just a lust thing, a heat of the moment thing, a \\"let's do this because it's exciting\\" thing. A man who really loves will wait to be married before becoming physically one with her. I felt their kissing was even lustful...not truly loving and meaningful like you see in the old movies. The languageand the nudity/sex would keep me from letting my young children see this film, and also the scene where the one officer puts a gun to his head and kills himself. <br />I think the filming was pretty good...there were some good visual moments. I think it was an awsome task to film some of the scenes in this film, and the Oscars won I am sure are very well deserved. <br />I have read much about the Titanic, and while this film is okay, I must say I got more out of my reading, and felt more of the tragegy in my heart for the disaster through books than through this film.
B00006IRHB|5.0|I think this video will be viewed in our home about as many times as is humanly possible. Every member of our family is a rabid Harry Potter fan. I have read comments that the movie's faithfulness to the book is alternately a strength and a weakness of the production. I believe it is a strength. There is, however, one small error in the film. When Hagrid blows into the island hut where the Dursleys are hiding out, he mistakes Dudley for Harry. This NEVER would happen! Aside from this small screenwriting blunder, the movie is perfect. It makes me wish I could go to Hogwarts! We are anxiously awaiting the fifth book and the second movie.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Beyond a doubt the best live album out there. It's a must have for a Metallica fan. Any metal fan will be blown away by this album. I consider it one of the top 10 albums of all time.<br />When I heard Metallica was putting out an album with an orchestra playing behind them I was skeptical. But when I played the CD I was amazed at how fantastic it sounds. The symphony arrangements give the songs so much more power and emotion (which I didn't think possible with any Metallica song). Michael Kamen takes great songs and brings them to a totally different level. The reditions of \\"Of Wolf and Man\\", \\"Fuel\\", and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are particularly great.<br />I don't know what album the people who gave it bad reviews listened to (maybe they were so put off by the symphony backup that they didn't really give it a chance). What I do know is that this album ROCKS !!!! In fact, I've given this album to non-metal listeners and they've RAVED about it. I cannot recommend it enough. <br />Do yourself a favor and buy this album. It's sure to become a favorite in your collection.
B000000H3Z|5.0|\\"Beneath the Remains\\" and its successor \\"Arise\\" are, without a doubt, two of the albums that define the genre of extreme thrash.  Taking the seminal thrash of originators like Slayer and Metallica to the next level, Sepultura helped provide the bridge that connected thrash to death metal.  I think \\"Beneath the Remains,\\" \\"Arise,\\" and \\"Chaos A.D.\\" make up a trilogy of consecutive classics, and here is where it all started.  While this album isn't exactly groundbreaking, what it lacks in originality it more than compensates for in speed, heaviness, precision and aggression.  On angry tunes like \\"Beneath the Remains\\" and the anti-conformity \\"Inner Self,\\" Max and co. channeled their righteous indignation into some of the heaviest music that's ever been produced.  Pretty much every song takes off at about warp five, propelled by Igor Cavalera's amazing drumming.  Max's vocals are a deep, barking growl, and his lightning-fast riffs combine with Paulo's bass lines to create a driving, bottom-heavy groove.  Andreas's solos are also terrific.  They're fast, just like the rest of the album, and there's plenty of cool distortion thrown in.  This remastered version also delivers a thick production that does justice to the music found here.  If you're a fan of thrash/extreme thrash/death metal, you should have this album.  Pure and simple
020530902X|3.0|I read Strunk and White as part of the recommended summer reading list before starting law school, and I've since been subjected to a few law professors leading the class through the ritual worship of bowing down before it. It seems to me though a cliff's notes to basic English that you were supposed to learn in high school, combined with a few quirky recommendations: such as never to end a word with \\"s',\\" so you'd write \\"I kicked the Chalmers's dog\\" instead of \\"I kicked the Chalmers' dog;\\" and never to use the word \\"thrust\\" at all any more, for any purpose, because it inevitably conjures sexual imagery in the reader's mind. Other than that, it contains a decent guide to the all-important art of writing succinctly, one I've failed to master as you can tell by now, such as using short sentences and paragraphs and that flow together naturally. Somehow though, even at a slim and extremely well-crafted hundred-odd pages, it manages to be dull. Somewhere out there is the ideal writing manual, but I haven't yet found it. This will have to do in the meantime.
B00005JK8K|3.0|First of all, Roger Willie is Navajo from New Mexico and Adam Beach is the only native from Canada who are the main characters besides Nicholas Cage.  The person who wrote earlier saying both the natives were natives from canada, should look more into it than making a statement like that(it will discourage other natives to defend where they are from originally). <br />Ok. To the movie now.  I think the movie could have been done better than portraying the traumatized soldier from his last battle.  Navajos characterize in this movie, were not given much of a chance other than say a few sentences and all about the code talk.  There is much more to that. Although this is more to say on this subject...i need to go.

B00005JKCH|4.0|I thought Spider-Man was a great flick. The fact that you can relate to Peter Parker puts it on a plane that no other comic has done. He has trouble in dealing with his mutation (Don't we all feel like we outsiders) and more importantly in love. Though the Green Goblin looks nothing like the one in the comics (I thought he was an actual goblin instead of a power ranger reject), it is slightly better than X-Men because of character development. We feel for Spidey/Peter and his toils....However does it really deserve the huge box office tak it has gotten. It grossed more 115 million dollars!!!I expected a big turnout, but the biggest ever. I loved the film and the people, but it didn't bring anything new to the table. The only thing that shows that this isn't like all the other summer box office bonanzas is its huge wad of money it raked in. Nothing else

B00005QG9J|4.0|Let me be up front:  I hate the metal/rap garbage that started becoming mainstream in the late '90s even more than the overall grunge scene annoyed me earlier in that decade.  Many of the rock bands I like from today may be considered \\"safe\\" (e.g., Creed, matchbox twenty, Goo Goo Dolls), but that is simply because there has not been a great rock music trend since heavy metal became mainstream in the 1980s.  The above-mentioned bands are at least accessible to someone my age, as they combine some of the best elements from various eras of rock music.  That being said, this album by this band has truly hit me the right way.  I certainly never thought I'd like an album that has the \\"record scratch\\" sound in it.  This band has changed that, much like the Red Hot Chili Pepers allowed me to appreciate music with rapping in it 10 years ago (with their \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magic\\" album) even though I hate rap music overall.<br />What I like about this album is that it is both rocking and mellow--a diverse collection, and the sound is accessible.  My favorite bands from the past can be both hard and soft effectively, and this band does this as well with a modern twist.  I love the mid-tempo track and big rock radio hit \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  \\"Nice To Know You\\" and \\"Warning\\" are other tracks that have improved the quality of what is on rock radio.  \\"Circles\\" and \\"Under My Umbrella\\" are other great rockers, and \\"11am\\", \\"Mexico\\", and especially the long closing track \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" bring this band into mellow territory that suits them very well.<br />I wasn't privy to this band's earliest releases; I admittedly became aware of them with the \\"Make Yourself\\" release and their big radio single \\"Drive\\".  While that album was decent overall, this one is even better--a truly listenable rock CD.  Call my overall rating 4 1/4 stars for a fine and diverse modern rock record that, while somewhat mainstream, doesn't cater to any particular current trend.  Very enjoyable.
6304082428|5.0|First of all, this version of Pride and Prejudice is my favorite movie of all time. Colin Firth...what more can I say?<br />Secondly, in response to those viewers who complain about the lack of subtitles in the DVD, SURPRISE - there is a subtitle option available IF you can adjust the Menu section of your TV set, not VCR or DVD player.  Most TV's have the option of turning on closed caption, which pops up at the bottom of the screen. It works, not only for broadcast shows, but for DVD's.  You don't have to touch the DVD Menu. Hope this helps you.
B00000099Y|5.0|This piece of music and most of Tool's recordings have been nothing less of great. Sure. Ridicule them because they are not as complex as some say. Obviously, those who ridicule Tool because of musical technicalities that don't stand up to their standards, are just not good musicians or not musicians at all. Every musician knows that it is not only your technicality, but how your music appeals to your listener. Sure, some of the material Tool writes is extremely simple. But you cannot catorgorize Tool as a simple band, whatsoever. Tool can all of the sudden pull you down into a hole that brings you into the next part of their journey. Carey's rythymic escapes are paralyzing as he brings you through several 6/8 feels throughout Aenima and Lateralus. Aenima set a stage for Lateralus. As a hard, studying college student of Jazz Drumset, I reach out and recognize Tool and truly believe that they are one of the most creative and influential bands, in the hardest time to be influential.
B000059LGC|5.0|Although the \\"mystery\\" isn't that intriguing, the performances from this star-studded film, the magnificent locations, and the superb Rota score make up for any deficits in the movie.<br />Ustinov, though not the physical embodiment of Christie's Poirot, is quite good at his interpretation of the Belgian sleuth. His sharp twinkle of the eyes, though reminiscent of a beardless Santa, still resonates a mind at work. It is good to see David Niven, one of the most elegant actors ever to grace the silver screen, in a supporting yet significant part. Veterans George Kennedy and Jack Warden are also on hand as respective \\"suspects\\" in the death of heiress Lois Chiles.<br />But, the acting nods go to a quartet of heavyweight grand dames of film: Angela Lansbury is a delight in the role of an eccentric lush of an author seemingly obsessed with sex; Bette Davis as a kleptomaniac dowager with designs on Chiles' baubles again shows why she is at the top of the women of Hollywood; and Maggie Smith as Davis's assistant is a joy as she trades barbs with her employer. Even though Mia Farrow is younger than the aforementioned, she still shows that she can hold her own in the role of a scorned woman with plans of her own. These women know how to deliver an award-winning performance.
068484267X|4.0|Who says publishers are not interested in your life. Frank McCourt proves otherwise. The book is very informative about the life in Irland in the age described by the author. The language is simple, including understandable accent. The story is very touching and realistic though sometimes I got the impression author is taking sadistic pleasure in so thoroughly describing painful experiences.If one is successful in life past painful memories are not painful in present but they give a triumphant feeling having conquered difficulties in life. I am sure Frank McCourt is enjoying his success. The presentation of dialogues has been done in a very peculiar fashion - an unorthodox way for sure. I also enjoyed a comic twist given to otherwise sad situations - kept me reading, otherwise I would not have continued. I am looking forward to reading 'Its.'
B00005JLHG|4.0|That was fun! Oh wait, you haven't seen it yet. 24 Hour Party People is a worth-see, even if you know very little about the Manchester punk era and the name \\"Joy Division\\" makes you go, \\"huh?\\" But the more you know about the era the more you will enjoy the self-referential storytelling that Michael Winterbottom makes fly from the opening flying scenes.  And thank you Steve Coogan for embodying Tony Wilson so well that he comes across entertainingly, theatrically real without being likeable at all. The film does run out of story to tell towards the end, but what a ride and what a great tale of a true come-back kid.  (FYI, there's a really good Joy Division boxed set now available called \\"Heart and Soul\\"/2001)
0792151712|3.0|When this movie came out I was sixteen. I didn't see the movie because I didn't go to theatres and we didn't have a TV. But that didn't stop my friend and I (especially I, because I had a crush on the Leo guy) from finding pictures on the Internet, reading books about the movie, so forth and so on. Later on we found the movie in my grandma's stuff after she died and brought it home.<br />I've seen it now two times all the way through - once last year, once just last night.<br />No longer being sixteen and swayed by baby-faced leading men, I look at this movie with more mature and calm eyes and my honest opinion is, it just isn't that great. For one thing, there is too much bad language/swearing, which I don't want to hear. Everyone knows about the nude scene and the car scene. One of the officers shoots himself in the head near the end. And this movie is rated PG? Some Shirley Temple movies are rated PG and there's not a thing wrong with them! I mean get a grip - this should be R!<br />As for the characters - Rose's hair (something my mother pointed out and which really bugged me this time) is far too red. I know that's not her natural colour because it did not look like that in Sense and Sensibility. She also wore far too much makeup. A more natural look, with her hair neatly up, would have given me a much more \\"period\\" feeling about her. Also she didn't have much power to me as a character because she's such a tramp. She's disrespectful, can't make up her mind what she wants. I couldn't feel much sympathy at all for her.<br />I couldn't really feel anything for Leo's character either. It's funny the things that appeal to you as a young weird teenager, because I see nothing now in Leo that's particularly wonderful, in looks or in acting. He didn't have what it took to make it worth Rose's running after him.<br />The dialogue between Rose and Jack seemed particularly strange to me as well. Except for Molly Brown, the other characters in general seemed to have a quieter, more refined way of speaking, while Jack and Rose just talked like 90's Americans. Totally wrecked the feeling.<br />Cal had a lot of potential as a character, but like most of the others, was sadly undeveloped. Interesting how his voice sounds a lot like James Mason's (Mason played in \\"North by Northwest\\", \\"A Star Is Born\\" with Judy Garland), something I did not notice before.<br />The only one of the set of main characters that evoked any feeling in me was the Thomas Andrews guy. He talked like a decent, respectable Irishman and outshone everyone else in the cast for the simple reason that he, obviously, knows how to ACT. I remember the first time I saw the movie particularly, I cried for him - not for any of the other leading characters.<br />Let's see what else should I say... Oh, yes, the special effects. At times I thought the moving water was no better than the old method of rear projection - it looked incredibly fake. But the sinking scenes I felt were done as well as could be done. I would agree that it was a great achievement on James Cameron's part, but it did seem like the movie was built around special effects, and everything else took second fiddle, really. Perhaps that's why the actors were so bad and the script so poor.<br />The music is very nice too. I still enjoy listening to my soundtrack CD sometimes, and I fell in love with I Salonisti - the group who played the first class music. (They did an excellent recording called \\"And the Band Played On\\" which you should listen to if you want some good music that is Titanic-related.)<br />I give this three stars because it isn't utterly AWFUL.

0618154248|5.0|I added this book to my registry because Curious George is a book I remember loving strongly when I was very young.  Curious George is a classic, and I wanted to share that enjoyment with my little one, when she becomes old enough to understand it more.<br />This set comes in a sturdy box that buttons to close and contains four different Curious George books inside.  The books are all board books and each one has the bright and delightful cartoons that I remember inside.<br />While my baby is still too young to get the gist of the stories, she does enjoy chewing on the book, hehe, and the bright colors keep her attention.  This is an awesome gift set, especially for the good price.
B00005Y228|4.0|I really enjoyed Kylie's Fever CD.  I must admit I enjoyed Light Years better.  Consdering she had a year and a half in between ablums, all is good.  &quot;Burning Up&quot;, &quot;Give It To Me&quot; and &quot;More, More, More&quot; can be repetitive.  The other songs are VERY fun to listen to and take me away a world full of problems.
B000066NW0|4.0|Excellent. That describes this debut album from Avril Lavigne. I am not usually a fan of this genre of music, preffering bands such as Pearl Jam, Silverchair and Incubus, but after hearing 'Complicated' and, yes watching the video I was intrigued. I wasn't convinced of the depth and talent of the singer/songwriting, until hearing 'Losing Grip' and 'Unwanted'. These two songs in particular show her harder edge, and I also love 'My World'. Even though the lyrics in some songs do leave somewhat to be desired ( the lyrics in 'Things I'll never say' and 'Losing Grip' are excellent),when up against established bands of the same genre, in years to come Avril Lavigne will be an even bigger force to be reckoned with. She will be compared to Britney and others, even Alanis because of their similar voices, but Avril has the talent and record label who will market her incredible beauty easily, (they got me didn't they), which is key, to succeed. I still can't believe Im liking this music so much, but in a time of a nu-metal and RnB dominated music scene, it's refreshing to see a telented MUSICIAN - key word!- with the right attitude. One to watch!

B000000993|4.0|My first review was stupid. This is a great rock album with progressive overtones and interesting song structures. \\"Crawl Away\\" and \\"Swamp Song\\" are catchy rockers with pummeling guitar riffs and hard basslines, and the 15 minute jam \\"Disgustipated\\" is one of the strangest pieces of music put together based on the theme of how Religious people will believe anything (thus the sheep noises you hear), and a hella creepy phone message from Maynard's crazed butler.<br />Check it out. It's beyond worth it, being that it is more cohesive.
B0000542D2|1.0|It is my considered opinion that whoever is responsible for the \\"digital remastering\\" of the songs on this DVD should be shot!  Believe me...I LOVE THE BEATLES!  That is why I'm so disappointed.  For one thing, the levels are totally screwy.  But to really hear just how f---ed up the sound is, listed to Paul's vocal on \\"And I Love Her\\". Then go and put on the cd or better yet your old vinyl version.  You've got hear it to believe it.  I'm sending mine back today. :-(  Don't waste your money.
B000059XUO|5.0|I've had to put this movie on my to-buy list again, since my original copy is so worn out.  I've seen this movie so many times that at one point I could quote it from beginning to end.  The casting, the setting, the story itself- all brilliant.  Brandon Lee is the definitive Eric Draven, Michael Wincott, playing Top Dollar, my favorite movie villain of all time.  The movie, based around true love, focuses on Eric Draven's need to exact revenge on the people who destroyed the happiness of him and his wife-to-be, shelly.  It's very powerful and, to this day, has the ability to make me cry.
B00005N53P|5.0|This album suprised me in how good it was.  From the average customer rating of 3 and 1/2 stars I thought it would have maybe three or four good songs but, actually the whole album is good.  The strokes have this rare ability to write songs that are very memorable that stick in your head for a long time.  &quot;Last Nite&quot; and &quot;someday&quot; are the two songs that are the most obvious hits of the album, but there are many more that are just as good if not better.  I don't know why people criticize this band so much.  It could be because these people are stuck back in the 70's when punk ruled and they dismiss anything that sounds similar because it just isn't good enough.  Well, I know of another band that borrowed heavily from a band of an earlier era.  Nirvana's sound borrows so heavily from the Pixies that it is so obvious to people who listen to the Pixies.  Does that make Nirvana 100% derivative?  No, because they write their own songs.  So, in deciding whether or not to buy this album the fact that some people claim this band to be &quot;derivative&quot; shouldn't be a factor.  The strokes are a great band and this is a truly great album.

Mitch sees his old teacher being interviewed on Nightline and afterwards visits Morrie every Tuesday until his death.  Morrie was a true teacher right until as he teaches he old student how to appreciate true pleasures of life and how love and family are more important than money and careers.  His lessons will continue to live on through this thought provoking and soul searching book and they will reach many more students than Morrie ever dreamed of.  Morrie must have been a truly remarkable person and as soon as I finished this book I reread it.   This book is highly recommended and a true 5 star book.
B000065V42|5.0|INTRODUCTION<br />In summer 1989, this worldly-weird movie bursted onto the screen by Disney, with the audience expecting another blockbuster hit like the previous summer's &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Include that with the rave reviews recieved, the great idea and Rick Moranis (very big at the time), and the audience flocked to the theaters announcing &quot;1 for Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;. Yet, people used to mix it up like, &quot;I Shrunk the Kids&quot; or &quot;Honey, I Shrunk&quot; or even (I heard this one myself) &quot;Honey Shrunk Kids&quot;. Soon enough, &quot;Honey, I...&quot; was a household phrase. Just because of this movie. What was so good and wonderful, and yet quirky and weird about this movie? Read on...<br />MOVIE<br />...continuing on, here's a brief, yet spefic description: When a baseball from the neighbor kid enables Wayne Syzlinski's shrinking machine to work, Amy and Nick Syzlinski and with the neighbor kids. To the kid's unfortune luck, they are stuck in the rear of the backyard, and need to walk about five miles (which is actually not that long, it will only take you about three hours, but it is a backyard full of dangers) to get back home. Throughout, romance blossoms between Russel and Amy, they ride bees (at the time, the response was the same as the door vault scene in 2001's Monsters Inc: Make a Disney ride out of it!), avoid huge water droplets from sprinklers, dangerous scorpions and huge forgotton toys, and don't forget the horrible world under the grass (which A Bug's Life gave us a second helping of nine years later). <br />REVIEW OF MOVIE<br />This movie has got to be the greatest display of how trippy the live-action movies of the late 80s were. Watch the first 30 minutes, complete with a completely-80s animated opening sequence (which gave a first look into computer graphics and hand-drawn animation combined). But, later, the very quirky mad scientist score and trippy idea gets on you...until the scorpion and Russel kissing Amy...it gets pretty trippy again. Just until the kids almost get eaten (yes, the Cherrios-ad scene) the movie's a weird experience. If you happen to take a trip to Disney/MGM Studios at Walt Disney World, the HISTK playground gives you exactly what this movie was like. But, this movie is wonderful, a great experience for all...
B000063DI9|5.0|I have had this album all of 2 days and already I feel compelled to write a review on this fantastic production.  For Maiden to produce such an outlandish and mystical production was a risk and a half after solid metal albums like 'number of the beast'.  I can understand why some fans won't like this album because it does differ from earlier releases and this certainly is not 'balls to the wall metal'.  Seventh son of a seventh son takes metal up to a higher level and the added use of synth/keyboards is a masterstroke, the emotion the they  added was immense. Fear not though the old Maiden is still there with the killer riffs and guitar solo's with Dave and Adrian performing brilliantly, Harris as good as ever on bass and with Nicko's stylish and technically outstanding drumming you can't go wrong. Mr. Dickinson?, one the best vocal performances ever, his voice suits the epic theme as the god-like story teller, shire brilliance. As for the album theme I think it is one of the best of all time, a fantatastic biblical type story for which ordinary people can take so much from as it explores subjects like reincarnation, immortality and magic...My first experience to listening to this album was a powerful one, I was glued from start to finish as it was such a high powerful experience, very thought provoking.  As it ended and all was quiet I had to take a breath from coming back down to earth (I was at work at the time) and all I could think about was listening to it again (I didn't want to over listen but I couldn't resist, listened to it over and over throughout my shift!).  All the tracks on the album are excellent, not one filler and all classics in their own right.<br />As you may have guessed by now I did like this album but I don't think it's for everyone.  If you are looking for a solid metal album to pump up on the stereo and get you all fired up this isn't for you(try 'killers', 'no. of the beast').  However if you are looking for a very high, thought provokingtrip to an ancient world with a whole range of conflicting emotions brought to you by masterfully innovative musicians then you've got to buy this album.<br />Steve Harris's vision was realised, a gamble that paid off as Maiden took their progressive style up a level and with this level of creativity who knows what they can achieve in the future.  Bottom line is this knocks the socks off anything around today, very powerful stuff indeed.

They all sound wonderful.  I found myself singing right along with all the great songs I've always enjoyed.  Some reviewers/critics have said...ah, this is just another bunch of songs for someone to make a bunch of bucks real fast.  If you buy the CD and don't care for it, give it away to someone who appreciates Elvis and his music.  I bought it for the pure enjoyment of fond memories of years gone by, where I was when some of those songs were released, what was happening it the world at that time, and could I still find some of my old Elvis records to replay on my phonograph (record player to some people). Yes, I still have one that works.<br />Just getting your CD?  Put it on, sit back, kick off your shoes, relax, and sing along with Elvis and the gang. It's enjoyable, and even if you can't sing worth a drop in a bucket, who cares.<BR>Don't get All Shook Up, let your Hound Dogs howl right along with you.

0553573403|5.0|I hadn't ever read a fantasy novel prior to 'A Game of Thrones', and  nothing in the fantasy genre I've read since has topped it. It truly is the best novel of its kind, epic in scope and grandeur. It tells the story of the Stark family, your typical 'Hail Britannia' unit, and the strife that ensues after King Robert Baratheon asks the Stark patriarch, Eddard, to serve as the 'King's Hand'.<br />The novel is told in third person omniscient from the perspective of many characters, including Catelyn (Eddard's wife), and his children Brandon, Arya and Sansa. Other characters include the delightfully malicious, yet strangely human Tyrion Lannister; Eddard Stark's ... Jon Snow; and the exiled princess Daenerys Targaryen. The characters are precisely the reason why the Song of Ice and Fire series is so brilliant - they are drawn in precise detail, yet you never know exactly what they're going to do. George R. R. Martin delights in building up our sympathies for certain characters and then smashing them with one foul swoop. As a result, the characters, like the plot, are totally unpredictable.<br />There are moments in this novel that, like great movies, can only be truly enjoyed upon first viewing. So, for all those who haven't read this book, savour it. When you come to those scenes which take you completely by surprise, stop, and remind yourself that moments like those in literature don't come around very often. A Game of Thrones is an amazing read that flies along at a fast pace, but be warned - no other fantasy novel (I think) has ever come close to being so good.

They aren't the same band I fell in love with. It's a good album with great songs, just a little change. I guess I just missed the sounds they had w/ Tragic Kingdom and Saturn. Anyone who is a true No Doubt fan will like the album, just be suprised by some fresh new sounds!!

Don't Let Me Get Me is another strong track which is about wanting to be someone else. In my opinion the strongest track on the album is Just Like A Pill. It has a strong rock influence. Family Portrait is an emotional track avout her growing up. This song is the second best. 18 Wheeler is also great. Strong attitude. <BR>The rest of the album is strong. She changed her style from her last album but in a good way!!
6304806418|5.0|Evita is a good film on many levels. As a musical, it has a fantastic soundtrack; songs such as \\"High Flying, Adored\\" and \\"Waltz for Evita and Ché\\" stay with you long after the credits finish. As a bioepic, it is also strong, giving the viewer the feel for the rapid rise and fall of Eva Duarte. And, needless to say, as a Madonna movie, it's practically Citizen Kane.<br />However, there is another way of looking at the film: as a statement about government. The nameless everyman played by Antonio Banderas is named \\"Ché\\" where he is named at all, an almost certain reference to Ché Guevara. And the film itself shows Juan Peron rise to power as a populist general, only to turn against his people as a dictator as brutal as those that preceded him. Eva was used to distract people as their liberties were trampled; \\"She's the one that's kept us where we are\\" Juan sings. And when she dies (it happens at the start, so it's hardly a spoiler), Ché rightly sings that \\"Your queen is dead, your king is through). Evita held the government in place, and it will crumble with out her, because of it's repressive rule<br />And... um, I guess I may have sort of wandered off here. Bottom line: don't be a despot; watch Evita.
6305609705|5.0|1979 film by Francis Ford Coppola, inspired by the book Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad. Great cast staring: Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen, Robert Duval, Lawrence Fishburne, Harrison Ford, and Dennis Hoper. This film was nominated for both Best Picture and Directing.<br />This is an epic tale of a man (Willard) with a mission to kill an ex-military leader (Kurtz), who has gone insane, from the reality of wars, and has killed three officials, with his own army of followers. At the start you see how ill Willard feels from this War, and he accepts the mission, but does not realize how terrifying it will be. By the end of the film you could say Willard has taken on the role that Kurtz had filled. <BR>The closer he gets to Kurtz, the more absurd his situation gets. The film is very well made, and can be analyzed for hours. Every shot and scene, the music that plays, the narration, adds to the idea of what the War is doing to these men. Being in a distant land away from home, away from loved ones, needing to kill. This film can be seen as an existential crisis, with all the absurdities and brutality Willard sees on his mission to execute Kurtz. See this film, for the inspiration, and epic story telling it contains. There are so many memorable characters, and moments. If you like war films, you have to see this, and anyone who likes an interesting story would enjoy this. But beware this film contains strong themes of horror and insanity. Be glad you are not in war. 5 stars. Check it out.

I figured, &quot;what the hell...&quot; and watched it. I am BEYOND glad I did! No movie has ever had me laughing as hard and consistently as this one. The movie never gets old for me and it's actually one that my mom will watch on multiple occasions with me. <br />John Goodman, John Ratzenberger, Billy Crystal, Jennifer Tilly...GREAT CASTING JOBS! Hats off to Disney, this is the best &quot;new school&quot; animated Disney movie to come out, bar none.
B00005J6T1|5.0|In 1983, an unknown pop-starlet called Madonna released her debut album. I don't think Madonna thought she would become the international superstar she is today, that's why this album is mostly dance-oriented, more so than her follow-up albums Like A Virgin and True Blue which definitely had a more mainstream pop sound to them. Madonna may not have been an international superstar at this stage in her career, but she was huge in the clubs. Everybody and Holiday support this theory as they raced up the dance charts and No.1 stardom beckoned. Nevertheless, this album has sold 10 million copies to date and inspired a generation. The album was titled \\"Madonna\\" in South Africa, Canada and the USA, but was called \\"The First Album\\" in Europe, Australia and the UK. Why? Why not?<br /><br />The music on The First Album, infact all of it is dance-oriented with an obvious touch of pop. The album opens with \\"Lucky Star\\". This song, Madonna's second single, proved to the critics that Madonna was no one-hit-wonder as the song peaked in the US Top 10 and No.14 in the UK. The song is bursting with energy and power with its upbeat and funky bassline, along with Madonna's great vocals. \\"Borderline\\" was the third song to be taken from this album, where it charted at a dismal No.56 in June 1984, but was re-released in January 1986 and peaked at No.2. The song is a much more mellow effort than most of the other songs on this album, but it still has Madonna's soaring vocals with a bouncy bassline that is bound to melt the stoniest of hearts. The video to Borderline is superb, and was included in VH1's 100 Greatest Videos Of All Time. MTV was the biggest helping hand in the early stages of Madonna's career. People could put a name to a face and it was a brilliant way of promotion for her single releases - a factor that still stands prominently today.<br /><br />\\"Burning Up\\" was released as a single in some countries and has a high-energy, sexually charged video to accompany it - one that garnered heavy rotation on MTV for the best part of a year. The song has some amazing guitar work going on with a traditional dance bassline to get your freak on to! \\"I Know It\\" is another up-tempo dance track with an excellent synthesiser bassline, which was the main instrument used in Eighties pop songs. The lyrics aren't very good, but Madonna sings away to her heart's content - as she does on all the eight tracks on this album. \\"Holiday\\" was Madonna's first ever song to be released as a single. It charted at No.6 in UK in January 1984. If you want a definition of a true Madonna classic, this is it. The ten-note intro that runs at the beginning of the song is almost legendary and was most greatly appreciated on Madonna's Drowned World Tour 2001. The audience goes berserk when this song starts, basically because it's just so fun to listen to - a real party track that still sounds as fresh and new as it did 20 years ago! The song basically rocks gently with its melodic sweetness sending out party invites (\\"Everybody spread the word...We're gonna have a celebration\\").<br /><br />\\"Think Of Me\\" is the album's worst track, yet it's still a brilliant Madonna song to get down to. The thing I noticed the most about this song is the vocal arrangement: it's superb and expertly done. The lyrics aren't very good, but pop songs aren't meant to have phenomenally, thought-provoking lyrics, are they? The bassline is excellent, while the instrumental halfway through is a great listen. \\"Physical Attraction\\" is one of Madonna's most underrated songs ever. The song had almost been forgotten by 1987, but Madonna made everyone remember just exactly why it was such a good song when she included it on \\"You Can Dance,\\" her remix album. This is the longest song on the album, clocking in at 6:35 minutes. The lyrics on this song are excellent and very memorable, especially when the tingly bassline is added after the line, \\"Maybe we were mean to be together. Even though we've never met before.\\" Madonna makes convincing attempts to live up to the sex-kitten image when she speaks with her deep voice on songs such as this one. \\"Everybody\\" is a brilliant song to close such an amazing album. This was never released as a single, but received heavy airplay in nightclubs throughout 1982. Holiday is Madonna's first single, but Everybody is the song that made her a star in the clubs. The lyrics are just pure fun as Madonna begs you to \\"Get up and do your thing.\\" And the listening audience is instantly convinced, as this song is so infectious it will get anybody dancing. Sire records (Madonna's record company at the time) released a 12-inch of Everybody in October 1982. Those who choose to see Madonna, as a self-image mongerer might be surprised to learn that not even the Queen herself was featured on the sleeve for the record. I'm not sure of \\"Burning Up (12\\" Version)\\" and \\"Lucky Star (New Mix)\\" because my version of this album is the original version, not the remastered version.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />If you don't own this Madonna album, you really need to get it now, as it truly is a must-have for every die-hard fan. Madonna's debut album represents the dance/club styles of the early 1980's. Other essential Madonna albums that follow the similar style showcased on this album are Like A Virgin, True Blue and You Can Dance. I feel Like A Virgin is superior to the rest of Madonna's 1980's albums, because it was her true breakthrough album. The lyrics are good, but not excellent whereas the overall mood of the album is stunning. If you're ever feeling down and you need to feel happy, this record should be in your CD player straight away!ing attempts to live up to the sex-kitten image when she speaks with her deep voice on songs such as this one. \\"Everybody\\" is a brilliant song to close such an amazing album.

0441172717|5.0|WARNING: There may be spoilers in this review if you actually haven't read this book yet.  Go read it.  Now.<br />Strangely enough, it took me a few attempts to read the entire text of Dune, and I am usually not one to leave books unfinished.  My first attempts failed because some of my false impressions about the book were fueled by the first third of the story.  Though Herbert launches into the story without giving much thought to the nuances of the universe he has created, the story in the beginning is very concrete and easy to absorb.  However, when Paul casts his lot with the Fremen, the plot becomes increaslingly abstract and the writing gradually loses control.  I was one who had difficulty understanding the limits of Paul's prescient awareness, the changing goals of the tribe, and the marvelously confusing effects of the Water of Life.  But the &quot;real&quot; part of the book is a mere prelude, the Fremen, led by Usul (Maud'Dib), hold the real meaning of this book.  How Herbert creates such an intricate world I cannot begin to guess.  Arrakis is an incredible creation, rife with fascinating characters and political intrigue, but secretly controlled by a complex and beautiful religious movement seeking to remake the planet.  The setting in itself is reason to read this book, but Herbert's real strength lies in his characters.  Maud'Dib's transformation from naive youth to messiah is the caliber of character development that we are not likely to find in modern science fiction.  And the conclusion, though abrupt, is a massive redirection of the story, in tune with the epic scale of the book.  If you haven't read it yet, it isn't quite too late.  With the prequels coming out, now would be a good time to start.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Sex and City has gotten better and better since its debut a few years ago, but it is still fun to go back and revisit the way it all began and realize that this was a wonderful show from day one.  The characters all begin to develop quite naturally by the third or fourth episode and the show becomes quite addicting by that point as well.  This is a hilarious look on life in New York from four sassy young womens' points of view, but anyone can relate to the problems that come up in their never-dull lives.  The DVD features some nice extra features; however the picture is a bit grainy in some scenes for some reason (that's why it did not get a full 5 stars) which is annoying at times.  Other than that, a wonderful release.  Make sure you check out seasons 2 and 3 as well.  Can't wait for the release of season 4!
B00000IREA|4.0|Roger Vadim's sexy sci-fi opus starring his then wife Jane Fonda as the outer space adventuress Barbarella opens with the now famous strip-tease scene over the opening credits. Fonda peels out of her space suit accompanied by the sexy sixties pop theme song. She is totally nude but discretely covered here and there by her arm or a letter from the credits. You can still see her breasts anyway. Based on a notorious French comic strip character, this futuristic saga is more of a fetishistic ode by Vadim to Fonda's kittenish sexuality. Through all of her sexual escapades throughout the film, he focuses (like he did with Bardot) on her beauty and body whether nude or clad in skimpy \\"futuristic\\" costumes. What stuns me is this got a \\"PG\\" on DVD. It's too raunchy for a \\"PG\\". Parents should be cautioned before letting their kids see this. Although, older boys will find it a turn on like their fathers did---but it's very campy and a lot of the humor will be lost on today's generation. Still, it's a nice time capsule for what the sixties had going on and Fonda is beautiful.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White is one of the greatest animated masterpieces of all time.  Although it was an experimental film at the time of its release (no one had ever made a full-length animated feature before), there is not a hint that the creators at Disney didn't know exactly what they were doing when they made this beautiful movie.  The DVD features a perfectly cleaned up picture and soundtrack.  Everything looks and sounds beautiful.  The extra features are QUITE extensive as well; documentaries, behind-the-scenes, interviews, games, deleted scenes, alternate music tracks, you name it, it is here!  This disc features hours of enjoyment.  Disney has definitely done good with this release!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought Nora Jones's Come Away With Me on a whim after hearing Don't Know Why on the radio and on MTV not thinking I'd be that impressed.  Boy was I wrong!!  She is fantastic.  I have never heard a singer like her before.  Her vocals are creamy, smooth and astonishing.  She is a throwback to the Billie Holidays and Sarah Vaughns of the world but unique in her own way.  I really hope people experience this phenom if they really care about the state of popular music.  In an age where hip hop and Britney rule the music scene, Norah is like a refreshing light at the end of that tunnel.  I especially enjoyed Cold, Cold Heart, Painter Song, and The Nearness of You but you really can't go wrong with this album.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone regardless of your musical tastes.  Yes folks she's that good!
1559409002|5.0|Where the films of H.G. Lewis are interesting today as camp curiosities, industrial filmmaker Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS remains a chilling existential drive-in ghost story. Candace Hilligoss plays Mary Henry, a young girl who survives a waterbound car accident. She promptly leaves her hometown, travelling to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. Mary is haunted by visions of a ghostly man (Harvey), and is strangely drawn to an abandoned pavilion where other apparitions seem to congregate. She periodically has strange \\"spells\\" in which she can't hear anything but her own voice, and no one around her seems to know she's there. She can't connect with anyone emotionally, including her overly amorous neighbor at the boarding house, the minister of the church where she plays, her landlady, or the doctor who tries to help her. If you've seen any horror films in your life, you've probably figured out the mystery; the plot is very simple, but that's not important. Atmosphere is the name of the game here, and Harvey (directing from a script he co-wrote with friend and fellow filmmaker John Clifford) lays it on thick: the film is eerily photographed; the amateurish performances of most cast members only enhance the dreamlike atmosphere; the all-pipe organ score drones dirge-like non-melodies endlessly throughout, sending chills up one's spine. There are many images in the film that were later copied in other great horror films: Mary emerging from the lake after the accident, covered in mud, looks alot like Carrie covered in pig's blood on prom night; the white face of the mystery man peering up into Mary's window resembles a simliar shot in HALLOWEEN, when Jamie Lee Curtis thinks she sees someone standing in her back yard; and of course the ghouls bring to mind Romero's zombies; I sometimes even wonder if David Lynch might have seen this film. But unlike those films, here we see nary a drop of blood in sight. This film proves that to make an effective chiller, a director need not resort to wall-to-wall gore tactics; in fact, there need not be any onscreen violence in order to generate suspense and atmosphere. Sometimes, violence, even gore, is necessary in a film. But in this case, gore would have destroyed the atmosphere. This is not only one of my favorite horror films, it is one of the best utilizations of a low budget I've ever seen. The incredibly eerie B&W photography, the jittery music, the stilted quality of the dialogue and performances (to some extent unintentional, no doubt)... the mood of this film is its most important asset, and as such, I think every filmmaker interested in working in the genre should take a look and learn. Sure, maybe there a few unintentional laughs here and there, and it isn't exactly horrifying, but overall it leaves you shaken. This will probably not appeal to slasher fans or splatterpunks.

B000002OZY|5.0|The Who's &quot;Tommy&quot; is a funky concept album. It might not be so funky had I seen the rock-opera itself. I can say the music, even out of context, is first rate.<br />You know &quot;Pinball Wizard.&quot; Everyone does, but it is the songs deep in the CD which make it a classic. Several of the other songs are classic rock standards as well, but to hear the not-so-angry &quot;1921&quot; shows the listener these guys are more thoughtful and romantic than fist-clenching &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It.&quot;<br />More than counter-culture, the Who's &quot;Tommy&quot; album draws out a sense of questioning. Am I worth anything? More than one teenage boy has felt as deaf, dumb and blind, and longed to be known.<br />Best listened to during a long drive, with no disruptions, or in headphone bliss with a glass of something cool.<br />I fully recommend &quot;Tommy.&quot;<br />Anthony Trendl
0060922583|3.0|This book is well writen. If I agreed with the content I would give it a five. However, an author that beleives in psychokinesis, miracles, faith healing, levitation, ghosts and a million other unsubstantiated phenomena cannot be taken seriously. Someone who uses stigmata as an example to reinforce an arguement is not credible. This book, although it presents an interesting idea, kills it with [ridiculous] beliefs. Nebuchadnezzar?<BR>Get Real!!
6304539282|5.0|I love this trilogy. I was 9 years old when I went to see Star Wars at the movie theater and 4 more times after that. From the first scene, when the destroyer flies overhead, my jaw dropped in amazement. The special effects of these movies are so good that even today they hold their own compared to the cgi effects of the newer films (which in my opinion are terrible). The acting is very good and natural, the script is articulate and multidimensional and the storyline is dinamic and layered. I love all three of them. Overall: EXCELLENT.
B000021XR5|5.0|Tending to move its directions per each album, STP's move to their penultimate effort, No. 4, is maybe the most simple and most interesting: there is nothing new here, but the band proving they still could be a hard, solid heavy rock team. From the opener \\"Down\\" to \\"Pruno\\", Dean Deleo breaks with a remarkable return to guitar-driven tunes, such in a way of Dead And Bloated or Silvergun Superman were in previous appearances, while both \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"Sex And Violence\\" range to a higher agressiveness the band never reached. Aside from this first impression, other tracks like the psychedelic \\"Glide\\" or the sarcastic lyrics of \\"I Got You\\" give a good notion of the band's [still intact] sweetness, which had gone unnoticed in \\"Tiny Music\\". <br />Despite the radio friendly \\"Sour Girl\\", No.4 was a sort of rebel posture from a band that seemed to be tired of treating with a little of respect. If they had anything to be proved, and in my opinion they had some, it was proved. One of the best and most enjoyable records of the 90's.
0446608955|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is the author of many best-selling novels including THE NOTEBOOK, MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, and his latest love story, A WALK TO REMEMBER. A WALK TO REMEMBER during year 1958, which is a heartwarming story that focuses on two restless young teenage on the account of young, innocent first love, which changes the outlook of the main characters towards life. The illustrations and descriptions of each character create a vivid image in the readers' mind. Landon and Jamie, the two main characters, are teenagers that live in a quiet coast in Morehead City in Beaufort, North Carolina. During those times, when there was nothing much to do, young people would walk around barefooted on wet mosses and mud during the months of April through October. The townspeople, on the other hand, greeted everyone, even if they were strangers. In other words, they were pretty friendly.<br />Landon Carter is a mid high school student who experiences what an average 17 year old doesn't. His father, working as a United States Congressman, pressures Landon to become a miniature version of himself by expecting Landon to run for the student body president. Due to the fathers' job, Landon was often left with his mother whom he loved more. Thus, the relationship between him and his \\"old man\\"(as Landon referred in the book) wasn't that firm. He pleases his father by running, and soon wins. Along with becoming a president, Landon obtains numerous responsibilities, including the attendance to the homecoming prom. Since his ex-girlfriend had dumped him, he has to find a date to go to the prom, to avoid embarrassment. An atypical high school girl who wears old sweaters, plaid skirts, and ties her hair up in a bun is the girl Landon decides to take. Jamie carries a bible every where she went and believed in situations in life according to the Lord's plan. Normally, she is not an approachable girl, being a minister's daughter, and not exactly a girl friend material. After the date at the prom, things turned out differently and were unexpected but successful. Willingly, Landon walks Jamie home with curiosity in his head about whether Jamie's kindness was a pretense. One walk back home led to many other late walks.<br /> Landon takes part in a Christmas play after much pleading of Jamie. After much thinking, he thinks that she has done a lot from him, and therefore feels that she deserves something too. From, acting comrades, it develops into a more intimate relationship, until actually; they can't live without each other. Jamie diagnosed with a serious illness, Leukemia does not keep the love that these two share, apart. Romance, tears, and a well-developed character like Jamie, brings what one can't expect. Their romance is definitely the talk of the book. <br /> This heart-wrenching plot touched me. I now really realize what people could do for love, and how a book, like Jamie and Landon, can't be judges by its cover. Jamie, a simple sweet girl and Landon, desiring prominence and popularity, both are different necessities. What touched me was how Jamie ended up changing Landon into a simple male like her, some one who he wasn't before. The walk after all, was a self-discovery for Landon, and his hidden love he had for Jamie. For all the lovers out there, you could possibly experience the exciting resolution that these two characters face. Furthermore, after reading the book, you could also purchase a video based on this plot, now available worldwide.
B00004XOWM|1.0|...The songs are horrible. The lyrics are [bad]. And the instruments are played by what sounds like amateurs. Don't waste your hard earned money on this CD...
0767805712|5.0|Superior Sci-Fi thriller about an 'advanced' future society in which genetic hierarchy is established - leaving an inevitable underclass to pay the price . Application and ambition are immediately negated by poor genetic makeup. Good schools reject kids with high probability of illness because of the lack of insurance cover. Companies refuse to invest in employees with poor health 'expectancy'. 'Genetisism' is rife , people are no longer defined by their virtues or abilities but damned by their genes. <br />Beautifully understated, it has intelligent dialogue (which I wont spoil by quoting) and a Micheal Nyman soundtrack that will break your heart. The acting is excellent. Ethan Hawke is both inspiring and endearing as the 'Inva-lid' who conquers not only a prejudicial system but the determinism imposed upon him by nature. However...Alan Arkin as the chillingly efficient Police detective betrays the absurdity of Hollywoods own hierarchy by convincingly acting the pants off most of todays 'A - list'. <BR>The film owes some of of its aesthetic beauty to Frank Lloyd Wrights architecture - its a testament to his futuristic vision that a building designed and erected by him in the 1950s should be an appropriate setting for 'Gattaca' , a film not only shot in 1997 but depicting a future possibly a hundred years from now. This film gets better with repeated viewing so buy the video - and dont let it sit on your shelf gathering dust (or eyelashes).
B00003CXI0|3.0|Ok Im a huge fan of the harry potter series. Altough My ultimate series is lord of the rings, harry potter was more laid back and funnier.<br />First off, if you've read the book, this movie will be a let down.  Daniel Ratcliff's performance was uninspiring and he really didn't put his heart into it.  Not that im trashing him, but compared to watson and grint his acting was horrible. I later found out he was an expierenced actor and the other two were new comers.  One thing that probably had to do with this was the fact that Ratcliff was actually asked to audition while the superiors were simply there on thier love of the book and their passion for making a name for themselves.<br />The visuals were very nice. The movie was shot at cathedrals and the like, so the backdrops were breath taking. The costumes were good too.<br />Another pet peeve I had was the many inconsistanties(did i spell that right?) with the book. One of um, were Hermoine was showing Harry the tropie of his father, it said that james was a seeker. Hullo he was a chaser! And whats with only one quidditch match!  There are more but i don't want to get into them (Midnight duel was another inconsistantie) I realize they couldn't do the whole book, but all that advertiesing was...wrong.<br />One more, I had to explain half of the movie to my parents cuz of the rearanged scenes and cut outs.<br />The thing that gives this movie its 3 1/2 stars was the acting by Watson and Grint and Coltrain. They each portraid their characters perfectly and really felt out thier characters. The backdrops, costumes, and the basic story still gave this movie enough grounds with me to get a descent score.  I will still get all of the other movies in the series cuz i do feel that Columbus will learn from his mistakes and I want to see grint and watson with expierence.
B00005JL95|5.0|This is a simply magnificent movie. I've seen it in the theater 4 times so far and have cried my way through it each time. I was not born in Hawaii, but lived there for more than 20 years. The film's creators' respect and love for Hawaii, its people, and its traditions are very evident. Stitch will tug at your heartstrings. Who among us has not felt left alone, wanting love? As for you who coldly condemn any family structure other than the one you approve of, consider the fact that some of us may not want that kind of family, or, like Lilo and Nani, might have lost the one we had. <br />In my opinion, apart from the sheer entertainment and humor, the strongest part of this movie is the message that what truly matters is love and caring and that families can be of any configuration. I also appreciated the un-Hollywood-like portrayal of Nani and the fact that Lilo's personality quirks and problems were not sugar-coated. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000002JSJ|4.0|I rediscovered this album after watching the &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; DVD, which in the director's commentary they mentioned that Robert Plant was happy to lend the copyrights for use of &quot;Achille's Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; rather than  the well-known and overplayed songs you hear on every Classic Rock station.  This is definitely worth adding to your Zeppelin collection since, though great, how many times can you listen to &quot;Stairway To Heaven?&quot;  Personally, my favorite is &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot; for its spunkiness and Bonham's pounding drums.  &quot;Tea For One&quot; is languid but engaging and &quot;Achille's Last Stand&quot; is arguably excellent.  The other tracks grow on you the more you listen.  It's definitely a nice respite from say, the monumental Led Zeppelin IV (which we called The Hermit album growing up). It also does not sound dated and elicited curious looks as Bonzo's thumping wafted out my sunroof; when you're in a rockin' mood Zeppelin still stands high above most.
B000001BZT|5.0|I first heard COPPERHEAD ROAD when I was in the army when some of my friends decided to turn the barracks into one giant party. Somebody decided to put this on, and I had to stop and listen, it totally had me hooked. The next day I went out and bought it and I still pop it into my CD player 12 years later. I am a rock fan, but  his blend of rock and country is just mind blowing. This album went with me to the Persian Gulf, during my tour of Korea, and now that I live here in CA. The first SEVEN songs are just classic songs that will get you going: COPPERHEAD ROAD, SNAKE OIL, BACK TO THE WALL, DEVILS RIGHT HAND, JOHNNY COME LATELY, EVEN WHEN I'M BLUE, and YOU BELONG TO ME. These songs are reason enough to buy this album. The last 3 songs are good songs, but to me they lack the punch of the first seven. Like I said before, this album had me hooked the first time I heard it, and very few albums have ever done that to me. So I highly recommend this album for addition to your collection.
0790729342|5.0|I only buy DVDs that I know I can watch over and over again and  Road Warrior is one of them.  Whereas Mad Max is raw and simple in its revenge theme, Road Warrior is a bit more complex: the embittered lone-survivor of this vast, cruel wasteland is still a man who has some human compassion in him but is reluctant to feel lest his survival instincts become compromised.  Beneath his stone-faced reserve you can see he struggles with this as the little urchin-boy vies for Max's attention and the clan he helps to defend against The Humungus desperately seek his help.  They are reminders of real people, like his wife and son he lost earlier to the road warriors.<br />But this is an action film at its best and even knowing the outcome the road battle scenes are still awesome and the evil warriors, looking like your worst nightmare motorcylce gang, are still scary as ever. And what more appropriate commodity to be fighting over than gasoline? This film will never feel dated for its futuristic outlook where oil becomes gold.<br />Personally, this is my favorite Mel Gibson role-hands down.  He's just too cool, too intense and a character you can't forget. Mad Max and Road Warrior are definite buys.  The last of this Outback trilogy, Beyond The Thunderdome, is a bit too over the top for me-it just feels too over produced- but I'd still recommend it to see what you think.
0316666343|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this novel after reading the reviews. What I do know is that I couldn't put it down. All the stories we read or hear about when someone dies are from the point of view of those left behind. Susie manages to open the doorway to a world invisible to our own. I was horrified, saddened, touched and uplifted at different times during this book. I looked forward to every page and my mind and imagination were opened just a little bit wider by the end. Read it...I know you will enjoy it.
B000002J29|4.0|I may be alone among long-time Genesis fanatics in not thinking the 1977 live set \\"Seconds Out\\" is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  I think it's a good, but by no means great, live album, and I'm throwing in a fourth star because the song selection is the best of any of Genesis' live albums; it's effectively a \\"Greatest Hits\\" of Genesis' 70s period.  It was only two years ago that I bothered buying a CD version of it.  The production is a little flat somehow, with the sonic colors of Tony Banks' synthesizers and especially Steve Hackett's guitar sounding washed out.  With the possible exceptions of \\"I Know What I Like\\" and \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\", nothing sounds any better than on the studio versions.  (By the way, when the crowd claps for no apparent reason during \\"I Know What I Like\\", it's because Phil Collins is doing a dance on stage.)  I've heard recordings of \\"Squonk\\" and \\"Firth of Fifth\\" from the \\"Duke\\" tour (the latter was the flip side of the 12-inch single of \\"That's All\\") that I like better than the ones here, and the excerpt from \\"The Cinema Show\\" on \\"Three Sides Live\\" has more intensity than this version.  Over the years, some people who've never listened to \\"Foxtrot\\" have insisted to me that the version of the epic-length \\"Supper's Ready\\" here MUST be superior to the studio version -- well, it's not.  This is good, \\"Foxtrot\\" is better.  (And why is it that Genesis always plays the closing section of \\"Supper's Ready\\" much slower live than it was on \\"Foxtrot\\"?)  The \\"Dance on a Volcano\\"/\\"Los Endos\\" sequence comes off well here.  All but one track on \\"Seconds Out\\" is from the \\"Wind and Wuthering\\" tour (though only \\"Afterglow\\" appears from that album), with Chester Thompson on drums.  \\"The Cinema Show\\" was recorded on the \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" tour, and has Bill Bruford on drums.  My copy of the CD, the \\"Definitive Edition Remaster\\", is banded improperly -- half of \\"Los Endos\\" is included in the \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" track.  I know it's sacrilegious, but I'd choose \\"Three Sides Live\\" over \\"Seconds Out\\" any day.    (1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie should have been buried at sea.  Not only was the story bad, but watching that coward baldwin as the War Hero Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle was as offensive as it gets.  baldwin wouldn't know courage, honor or integrity if it slapped him in the face.<br />The movie is so bad that the rental places are still selling the \\"used\\" ones for under 9 bucks and a major electronics chain is giving it away when you buy 1 of any of a dozen other movies and they're still overstocked with them.<br />Amazon editors: if you can't / won't post the part about the prices, at least post the first 1/2.
0786867973|5.0|I found this to be a very enjoyable cookbook.  This isn't the book that is best suited for the beginner cook though.  The recipes tend to embellish a bit on those that you would serve on a daily basis, but the book has a wonderful range of recipes.  It covers breads, desserts, main dishes, cooking for children, savory dishes, liquors, and much much more.  This book centers around British cooking with a variety of meat pies, triffles, pastries, jellies, and jams.  The book is well illustrated with many pictures, so if you like to see what you are going to make this book is good for you.  All in all this book is a very good book, has a great variety of recipes, and is a good sampling of British cooking.
B000022TSW|5.0|When I saw this movie, I had never seen an episode of South Park.  In fact, I still haven't seen an episode.  But this movie is absolutely hilarious, and more than enough of an indictment of censorship.  Featuring over a dozen pseudo-Broadway songs, which really are what make the movie, this crazy thrill ride starts with Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman innocently going to see an R-rated movie, and ends in the most wild way possible.  One thing I like is that this is the one movie I've seen where the profanity is not gratuitous.  Not only is it integral to the plot, but it's FUNNY!  However, the funniest thing of all is the brilliant plot that surrounds these 399 expletives and 40 rude gestures (according to Guiness):  South Park has been the victim of adult scrutiny for years, so what better plot for a SP movie than a plot of adult scrutiny?  Be warned, though:  the high content of violence, sex, vulgarity, blasphemy, political incorrectness, etc, while not gratuitous, is quite shocking ,so don't go expecting a pleasant stroll in the (south) park.  Whatever you make of it, this film is a truly wonderful satire, and will have you laughing, and thinking, for years.
B0000640VO|5.0|I don't have one bad thing to say about this movie. It is the most beautiful, uplifting piece of art I have ever seen in my life. No one I have recommended this movie to has been disappointed- most are pleasantly surprised. The colors, the cinematography, the sets and backgrounds, are all candy for the eyes. Even ones who don't know a word of French and have to read the subtitles love this movie- even ones who would otherwise refuse to watch any movie with subtitles. The theme and plot are lovely, like poetry, and Amelie is fit to inspire with her subtly witty and perfected art manipulation. Most of the time, she barely even needs to say a word, and Audrey Tautou's impish manner is perfect for the part.
B00004XOWM|1.0|1999's Significant Other from Limp Bizkit was often overlooked; a smart, bouncing album with an almost perfect mix between heavy metal and rap, even with some melodic pieces, and an appeal to audiences both black and white, young and old. Enough about that. One year later, the hastily made and stupidly titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water is a stupefying mess of faked anger and roughness; opening song Hot Dog is a swearfest of over 30 'F' words, with no reason behind it; nothing has happened to Fred Durst to make him [madd] at the world; while Fred may consider himself the voice of a generation; what he doesn't realise is that he is 30-year old man refusing to clear his room and thinking he is making a connection with the youth of America, while for some reason begging to be hated. The pointless mess of swear words simply displays an utter lack of creativity; while other artists such as Eminem can marvellously use swear words to show incredible talent and transport anger through musio, Fred Durst just turns out to be some dumb white guy in a red hat swearing for \\"shock value\\" which soon wears out, and for trying to establish a \\"cool\\" reputation to kids because of his potty mouth. Meanwhile, his band kick out the most uninteresting and simplistic of riffs, while the songs have irritating and nonsensical choruses like \\"keep rolling rolling rolling\\" and \\"my way or the highway.\\" This is not an album I am proud to own, let's put it that way.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is excellent, and everyone out there needs a copy of it!!Anyone who loves groups like New Found Glory, Weezer, Green Day, will love this band!! Their single \\"The Taste of Ink\\" is a great song, and has excellent words. The single is motivating, and makes you want to get up off your seat and jump around. Every song on their album can wake you up, because it's filled with so much energy!!! (if you have trouble getting up in the morning, you NEED this cd!!)  Most bands come out with one single, and you go out and buy the cd, and the cd isn't good. The Used isn't a band like that! I'm sure that you won't regret buying this cd!!
B000023VR6|4.0|As an object of much hate and doubt over the years since his classic 1992 The Chronic, Dr. Dre's 2001 is obviously strong on comebacks and vitriolic attacks on his detractors. However, such rap albums often neglect the most important ingredient to fighting such claims: the music itself. Here, the undispited king of West Coast gangsta rap proves himself to be better than any other producer in hip-hop with a seamlessly fine album; the music is always spot-on; you couldn't be prouder to have anything else booming out of your Acura while rolling through the hood. Lyrically, it's near-perfect; of course, Dre has never attested to being a great lyricist or even a great rapping talent, but on 2001, Dre's lyrical dexterity and slickness is amplified, with many rhymes that will have you praising the King of the West Coast. However, Dre has always relied on guests to provide the true mic skills; in this area Dre perhaps does indeed steal the show; we shouldn't be too surprised seeing as it is his album. 2001 is again very Snoop Dogg-heavy, as well as featuring much performance from usual guests Nate Dogg and Hittman. But perhaps the most extraordinary moments come from newfound mega-talents Xzibit and Eminem. On What's The Difference, Dre kicks it with both X and Em; total proof that he is still atop of his game; as he rhymes on Still D.R.E, \\"Kept my ears close to the street/Signed Eminem, he's triple platinum, doing fifty a week.\\" The closing song, The Message is a poignant and almost tear-jerking tribute to Tyree with a breathtaking guest-spot from Mary J. Blige who tenderly sings, \\"I'm trying to tell you something good/Don't get caught up in the hood.\\" 2001 could even be described as mature, while staying true to Dre's gangsta roots, at the same time refusing to get caught up in the past. One of the greatest triumphs ever in gangsta rap and a true testament to Dre's greatness and diligency. Still Dre Day. Key Tracks: Still D.R.E, Forgot About Dre, The Message.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Since this is my 100th review I've written since I started doing this a couple years ago, I decided to choose to review a movie very near and dear to me. With the rerelease of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" on DVD, it seems fitting and appropriate that this is the one I choose!<br />So many years ago, when Beauty and the Beast first was released, I hesitated going. After all, how could Disney possibly top its tremendous achievement with \\"The Little Mermaid\\". I ended up having to go, for the entire school where I was teaching at the time went. From the opening scene that takes us through the forest to the stained glass windows, I was totally awed.<br />If you don't know the story (who doesn't?), Belle is an intelligent, beautiful girl smart enough to know that what society deems her life to be isn't right for her. She yearns for something more out there, something she's only read about in her books.. She heroically saves her father from an unjust prison sentence by taking his place in the Beast's delapidated castle. There, through her honesty of heart, she sees through his gruff exterior, into his honest heart. The rest, as they say, is history.<br />Everything about this film worked back then, and it works just as magically now. The animation is crisp and daring. The songs simply spin powerfully and gently at the same time. The characters are real and realized, from the enchanted objects in the castle to the buffoon-turned-evil guy Gaston. The infamous ballroom scene, which 10 years so stunned me, still today stuns me, not for its techinical merit (after all, we've been exposed to Pixar's incredible work) but for its honesty and high emotional punch.<br />The DVD offers many treats for \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" fans. On disk A, they've offered three different versions of the movie: \\"Special Edition\\", \\"Original Release\\", and a \\"Work in Progress\\" version that mixed some animated parts with sketches and drawings. I particulary enjoyed the commentary done by the producers and song writer Alan Menken during the \\"Special Edition\\". Disk B comes with several interviews on making the movies, as well as games for the kids. It seems that Disney has struggled with making their DVD's worthy of the medium, but with this release, they've finally started to learn what they can do with it!<br />This is my third most favorite movie of all time. Perhaps it was the animation. Perhaps it was the music. Or perhaps it was being able to relate to the longing of a girl who wanted so much more for herself. Or even perhaps, it was the longing of the Beast, who only wanted something that he at first couldn't do himself; for someone to look beyond his appearance to see the beauty within. Perhaps they all work together, perfectly, in \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".g writer Alan Menken during the \\"Special Edition\\".

B00005Q45W|2.0|Did you ever wonder what it would sound like if you took the great voice and lyrics of Leonard Cohen, hired a karaoke band to play the music, then time-traveled back to the early 80s to produce it? Well, wonder no more!!!
0316286850|5.0|Before I was pregnant I used to work in clubs as a dancer. I knew a few tricks about make up but nothing compared to the knowledge gained after reading this book. This book will show you have to wear it from natural to dramatic......how to change your look completely or just play up certain features. There are also many celebrity styles and makeovers which blew me away. Kevyn also gave this book a personal touch which made it all the more memorable. He is adored by the many celebs who have worked with him and it is easy to see why. His style and personality come shinig through on every page. He believed in the beauty of women....ALL women and this is what he helps you accentuate. I learned many techniques but the most important thing I learned was how to play up my beauty w/o hardly trying. Kevyn Aucoin passed this year and although I don't know him I do miss him. His book left that strong of an impression on me. I recommend this book for those who just want a few extra tips or for those who know nothing at all. I also purchased a copy for my husbands sister who is in those teen years where she was experimenting with makeup. It has helped her to polish her look and scored me points with my mother in law who would cringe every time she tried something different on her face.

B00006690G|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that I own. You can tell that Eminem put lots of time into writing the lyrics. One of the best songs on the CD not including \\"Without Me\\" is \\"Square Dance\\". \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" also tell about the way he feels about his family, espicially his mom. He even wrote a song for his little daughter Hailie Jade, where he actually sings! People that appear on this CD are Obie Trice, D-12, Nate Dogg. Kon Artis, Von, Proof and Bizarre all appear on \\"When The Music Stops\\". Of course Dr. Dre and even Hailie Jade appear on this new CD.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is one of the most realistic sci-fic story I have ever seen for all ages. Totally  human and divine! The story line about his beginning was more than \\"unreal.\\"it is believeable! And  it is pretty likely that something like that will happen one day. <BR> The prevailing quality that stands out is how naturally humble Clark is. I wonder if Tom Welling by nature are those qualities he protrays; gentle, humble, caring, funny, intelligent, and security conscious in a cool way.<BR> I really love the way the story unfolds his supernatural abilities, it's logical! With special gifts, comes a sense of great responsibilities, and it's very intriguing how the story shows how these gifts were taught by his earthly parents,who were sensitively wise, understandingly patient, caring and insightful and as well as comical in timely fashion. Great way to teach us adults how to deal with gifted and high-powered adolences, whether natural or supernatural.<BR> I thought you should know, that I for one have thought most of the film world had gone the ways of stupidity, violence and money making tactics, and rarely indulge in any kind of televison series, but yours, I make it one of the highlights of the week. I am a non-church-minded-missionary but spiritual, and my passion is to use movies as a means to teach the youth of today the real meaning of life and how to skillfully face life in all aspects and quirks. Your series, has all the essential lessons that build character with meaning and direction  and as well as up beat source of entertainment, a rare combination to have. <BR> I look forward to see how Clark and those whom he cares for will grow to love and accept him for who he is and not for what he is. Very cool and suspenseful series.
B000002V0Q|4.0|Here's the truth: Dave can't sing for crap.  But MAN can he write some kick-ass metal.  And I believe this to be one of Megadeth's crowning achievements, where Dave finally compressed his songs to make them more accessible to the masses.  Some of Dave's older songs were complex, but they sounded like just a bunch of different riffs he jamemd out and decided to paste them together.  Here, Dave has cut down on the complexity, which I personally don't mind.  Symphony of Destruction is of course an all-time metal classic that will never die.  Sweating Bullets is easily one of Dave's best songs that he's ever written: introspective, fast, and a great guitar solo.  I'm impartial to this album because it contains my all-time favorite Megadeth song: Ashes In Your Mouth.  I can't explain why it's my favorite, all I know is when the intro stops and Dave whips out the first riff, it just makes my spine shiver.  I love that song and should be on Capitol Punishment in place of Crush 'Em.  This album is slick, heavy, and Megadeth's breakthrough commercial success and not without reason.  A great album and I highly recommend it.
0316096199|4.0|I absolutely loved the book, in fact I could not put it down.  Alice Sebold gives the reader insight of the emotional struggles she dealt with after her rape, and she bravely shows her reading audience the raw emotions that surround a rape victim not for one week or two, but what the victims deal with for years after. <BR>One in nine women who have been raped have the emotional strength to go through the system and get a conviction for their rapist.  I hope this book will demonstrate that it can be done, and must be done to stop the violence against women.<BR>Sebold tells a remarkable story that nailed me to my chair, and changed my attitudes and opened my eyes toward rape victims.  I am so glad I had the opportunity to read it.
B00005R87Q|1.0|They shouldn't of called this the Fast and the Furious, it should've been called Point Break 2. Same exact story except it's an under cover cop in street racing cars instead of on a surf board, and it has the same bad acting. I don't know who discovered Paul Walker and Vin Diesel, but they have about as much talent as a rock. They only way I tolerated this movie is because there are so many nice cars in it, that it makes it worth watching, but only once.
6305177473|5.0|I love this 1998 version of &quot;The Parent Trap&quot;; it's very much like the 60's version, except with a modern-day setting. It's the same memorable story with a fun present-day coating: 10-year-olds Hallie and Annie are identical twins separated at birth and accidentally reunited at summer camp. With a little work, they manage to switch places and then scheme to get their parents back together. Just like the old film, both twins are played by the same girl. Lindsay Lohan is a very talented young actress with a great future ahead of her; her acting style is very high-energy and shows a lot of ability on her part. It's every bit as fun as the original &quot;Parent Trap&quot;
0679640304|4.0|Without doubt, Byatt's much-beloved Possession is a tremendous achievement, creating two enthralling romances and believably spanning centuries, conjuring from scratch the life and work of two legendary poets who never existed. From the outset, the entirely original pairing of wan academics Roland and Maud fascinates -- the eventual coming together of these two to whom loneliness is not necessarily a curse feels both novel and true.<br />The brutal and rhapsodic affair between Victorian poets Ash &amp; Christabel is (knowlingly) more the stuff of melodrama, but told through letters and diaries, their forceful and particular personalities make them as interesting as the neurotic scholars.<br />There is much beside the terrific characters that fascinates in this rich book, thoughts on poetry and scholarship and, well, possession, that resonate powerfully between the two periods. And yet, as the book draws to a close with a winkingly silly &quot;melodrama&quot; denouement, complete with a secret revelation of ancestry, some of its magic fades. Much as the pastiches of Ash &amp; Christabel's major work begin as great fun but come eventually to feel like authorial showing off, so the final chapters seem too self-aware, an underlining of the &quot;A Romance,&quot; subtitle that feels like a vague betrayal of the reality of these vivid characters. As if the author does not trust herself or her critical following to accept the tall-tale format of this story, and so must set quotation marks around it.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|The wait was worth it for 'Beauty and the Beast' to make it's way to DVD. This has got to be the DVD with the best bonus features EVER! You start out with a highly in-depth look at the making of the film and the history of the story all hosted by the delightful Celine Dion. Celine also hosts a HIGHLY entertaining segment called &quot;The Story Behind The Story.&quot; In this segment actors Angela Lansbury, Robby Benson, Jodi Benson, Ming-Na, James Earl Jones, Paige O'Hara and David Ogden Stiers relive the Disney versions and original stories of 'The Hunchback of Note Dame,' 'The Jungle Book,' 'Mulan,' 'The Lion King,' 'Cinderella, 'Sleeping Beauty' and 'Pocahontas.' The DVD also features the music video to the highly successful song &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; performed by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. For some unknown reason, Disney felt it necessary to include a newer version of the song performed by Jump 5. It's a crime that Disney wasted these talentless youngster's time to record a version of the song that in no way fits into the magic of this film. Celine and Peabo already recorded the song beautifully. Why did Disney hire people who can't sing a note to record the same song? The film itself has been fully resorted and the picture and sound quality has never been better. It even includes a new musical number &quot;Human Again&quot; which I could really do without. Many people like the song but I think it's poorly written and even more poorly performed. But it doesn't take anything away from this being one of the greatest films ever made. I'm really happy with what Disney has come up with this time. This &quot;Special Edition&quot; actually is special. I can only hope Disney continues with these &quot;Special Editions&quot; and bring us 'Aladdin,' 'The Little Mermaid,' and all the other Disney classics. Hopefully they will do this sooner than later.
B00006CXSS|5.0|As the years pass and less of the WWII generation is around to tell the story, this is a thoughtful edition to the library of anyone wanting to record their sacrifice. The men of Easy Company together with the expertise of Tom Hanks and Steven Speilberg tell one of the most compelling stories I've ever seen. If actual history is your thing and you didn't see this when it was aired on HBO then I can guarentee you won't regret getting this. If you did see it and you're debating on getting this DVD, it is impotant to remember the sacrifice given when the outcome wasn't at all predetermined. For me, it helps me keep my little troubles in perspective.
B00006BTCA|4.0|This is not the best album of 2002.  It may not even be in the top five or six... Not with T.A.T.U, Andrew W.K., N.E.R.D, &amp; Flaming Lips already having released stunning albums on U.S. shores as well.  &amp;, hell, if I included all albums I bought this year &amp; not just those released in the aught-two, Kix' s/t, from '82(!), would give Turn on the Bright Lights a run for its money.  That said, I still enjoy this album very much.  Though not because it reminds me of Joy Division, since I was only two when that band broke up &amp; haven't either since then acquired a taste for them &amp; bought &amp; heard their record.  Rather, I get the same downbeat &amp; wistful but with a twinge of optimism that they can barely, but do, contain vibe from TOTBL that I got from the first that I heard Jimmy Eat World's Clarity.  Which I suppose makes me have to think I'm calling Interpol &quot;emo&quot;.  &amp; to my ear, &amp; given what I consider true emo (think: U2's The Joshua Tree &amp; most certainly not anything that Promise Ring, Sunny Day Real Estate (now on their second break-up!), or Get-up Kids (you know, the usual suspects) have done), this is nearly that.  &amp; it's a great thing to hear.  Particularly NYC &amp; Stella was a diver... The spoken intro on that song has me on the floor laughing every time I hear it, &amp; the guitar that comes in makes me play air-riffage.  Great stuff.
B00006JDSI|5.0|Just when I thought I'd FINALLY owned the definitive version of &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (the 84-minute version from IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT), along comes this &quot;AUTHORIZED&quot; version from KINO.  The running time:  93 minutes!  Nearly 85% of the scenes are longer (by a few feet of film), creating a much smoother, atmospheric and tension-building vision that Murnau had originally planned.  Some scenes are COMPLETELY new to me (after having owned over 12 different versions of the film--from 8mm, to VHS, and now to DVD!!)  This KINO print has come from some archival Italian film museum, and is even sharper than the IMAGE version...and even more appropriately color-tinted--(Count Orlok walking the deck of the ship is now BLUE for NIGHT!--for those who were bothered by the mistakenly amber-tinted sequence on the IMAGE disc).  Admittedly, this version actually gave me chills...for the first time!  <BR>Now:  as for the musical score...the DVD will automatically leave the FIRST option as your &quot;score of choice&quot;.  GOOD.  It's very well-composed...creating the perfect setting for each and every sequence.  WARNING:  Do NOT select option #2...not unless you want to experience the film with a COMPLETELY inappropriate soundtrack which sounds like a TECHNO-PUNK-HEAVY METAL-INDUSTRIAL MIXED-UP Mess!!--I can't describe it any other way.  That being said, you will definitely NOT be disappointed with this &quot;NEW &amp; IMPROVED&quot; release...and don't be mislead by the date of 1929 (that was the year in which &quot;Nosferatu&quot; hit the American shores).
B000066NW0|3.0|I bought this CD pretty much randomly after seeing Avril on TV once. I know she is all about being different but not trying to be but honestly this CD isn't anything amazing or different than anything else. It definately isn't a punk CD no matter what she says about being punk or just &quot;being herself.&quot; Seriously though, even if she is trying to be herself she can wear a different outfit everyonce in awhile and she doensn't always have to wear a tie to establish that she can do what she wants. It doesn't matter if you are being yourself nobody wants to see you wear the same thing everyday. Anyways, I will admit that I did like her song Skater Boy (or Sk8ter Boi, the &quot;cool way&quot;) when I first heard it but it is so overplayed on the radio it's ridiculous. I listened to this CD about two times and put it on my shelf somewhere and haven't listened to it since. So the bottom line is, if you like the songs of hers that you hear on the radio then you will probably like this CD otherwise don't expect to hear anything exceptional or different than any of the other female pop artists out there right now, even if they do all claim that they're different.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is a great CD, go to your room turn it full blast lie on your Bed for half an hour, you'll feel alot better, i'm 14 and this is great music, my mates love it, its a CD that, in a way tells you a bit about and describes it and still sounds good!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|How can you describe in words an album like OK Computer?<br />The same way you would try to describe your spouse, your best friend, or your dog - you can't. I have come back to this album hundreds of times as I would to an old and trusted friend, often times beaten back by the haughty waves of today's hollow rock. With every listen, I am consoled by the soothing angst of this remarkable album. An entire culture exists in this arrangement of sounds and words. An inconspicuous bass riff that you didn't hear before, a scintillating tinkle of electronic syncopation that magically emerges, or the groggy croon of Thom as he falls into harmony...these are the always-shifting doorways into each of my listens, leading me down the path to some new and deeper layer of the music. Truly, OK Computer's most extraordinary element is its mundane existence on a Compact Disc. Just as a loyal friend is merely a collection of atoms organized into cells, OK Computer is merely a collection of pits on the underside of a CD. Constant in its form, OK Computer is purely dynamic as living and breathing music. This amazing album exhales the stuff of genius.

B00005QZ7U|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a personal favorite of last year. It takes place in the early 1900s in Paris, France. Satine (Nicole Kidman) is a beautiful actress who dreams of making it big and is getting her career started at the Moulin Rouge theatre. Christian (Ewan McGregor) is a poor, struggling writer who, when he first meets Satine, falls instantly in love with her. To become famous, Satine's boss will not allow her to fall in love...she must marry the Duke (Richard Roxburgh). But soon after Christian confesses his feelings for Satine, she falls in love with him, too. Now, Satine must hide her love affair from the Duke and her boss before they both find out.<br />Baz Luthrrman has created a masterpiece. &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is funny, romantic, upbeat, and tragic. The music fits in well with the film, and the acting is just plain outstanding, especially the performances by Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor...they have amazing on-screen chemistry, as well. The DVD is amazing with tons of extras. There is a behind-the-scenes look at &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, interviews, music videos, a documentary on the music, and so much more. The DVD comes in a wide screen package. Besides being brilliant, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is also one of the most unique films I've seen in a long time. It definitely deserved all the praise it received. <br />I highly recommend &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;.<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+

B00000IFWE|2.0|From the nasally, up-close vocals of the first lame ballad, to the ending chords of the last song, Tom Petty is turning into a serious hippie!!  Just listen to his lyrics about freedom to smoke dope, running around in the grass, and all this Lenny Kravitz type junk about \\"letting love rule\\".  In my opinion, Petty should stick with the jangly songs he wrote of yor, where every song was a guaranteed FM rock staple.  These days he sounds tired, weary, and put off by everything under the sun.  For a hippie, he's pretty uptight about stuff.<br />Well, that's about it.  If you like hillbilly rock, check this one out.  Otherwise, stick with that other brilliant hippie dude, the one and only Neil Young.<br />CHECK YA' LATER, DUDES!!
B00003CXCT|5.0|Some apologists for The Phantom Menace, not all, defend it by saying, \\"Yes, it has its flaws; but it's just as good as the original Star Wars, which had the very same flaws.\\"<br />After a while it's hard to avoid the suspicion that they're right. Not about The Phantom Menace being a good film - it is definitely not - but about Star Wars being no better. Maybe we've been deluded these past decades. Similar delusions have persisted for just as long. Could it be that Star Wars, too, was an unimaginative, flatly directed, kiddie movie?<br />NO! Most certainly, it was not. One thing The Phantom Menace reveals, though, is that Star Wars was not fated to be as good as it was. It became great partly by accident.<br />Harrison Ford has genuine charm; Mark Hamill is perfect as the innocent adolescent with a tendency to whine; Alec Guinness needs no comment; and no other female lead had the strength of Carrie Fischer - at least, not while playing a traditional princess. Maybe this perfect cast was assembled by sheer chance. (Lucas never replicated the feat, after all.) But so what? It's still a perfect cast. They all created memorable characters; and moreover, as characters and actors, interacted successfully with each other.<br />Mos Eisley's spaceport was also a fortuitous accident. \\"Never will you find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy\\" - yet it managed to avoid being a thriving, respectable looking town largely because George Lucas didn't have the money to turn it into one. And a good thing too. It's possibly the most frightening place in the Star Wars universe: truly grimy, light years away from real civilisation, crawling with odd and touchy aliens.<br />With art direction, special effects, and music, too, George Lucas struck gold. Has a science fantasy world ever looked better? Have special effects ever succeeded in making such a world look more real? Arguably not - although this isn't what makes Star Wars unique. Nor is the music (although the music is part ofwhat makes it unique). No: there really is magic here. It sounds a cliché, but there IS something about the simple but honestly pursued story, or the world, or the score, or something, that lifts Star Wars high above by-the-numbers space opera - the same indefinable element that makes Das Rheingold more than a soap opera with occasional sorcery, and The Lord of the Rings more than the first of five thousand episodic fantasy adventures. This is the company \\"Star Wars\\" belongs in.<br />I for one am thankful that Lucas never had the time or money to over-fill Star Wars in the way that he has Epiodes I and II. The new films are perfect examples of how self-indulgence achieves only one thing, the spoiling of the art.<br />If the film isn't quite up to the standard of the aforementioned opera or the book, well... maybe that's because it found its way into such company by accident. It belongs there all the same.
0553565915|2.0|Eadie's report of the afterlife is much more simple-minded than other books in this genre. It seemed strange that she waited so many years to write about her experience, and I wonder if her memory has embellished the particulars. First of all, there is no proof Eadie actually \\"died\\" after her operation, as she describes no life-reviving efforts that would have been happening if she had flat-lined (didn't this hospital have any nurses watching the monitors?) Next, sorry, but I don't believe Eadie met Jesus. If indeed her spirit slipped from her body, she may have met a spirit, but her simplistic notion that this was Jesus goes along with other shaky assumptions she makes in these pages. She says some people are purposely given miserable lives so others can learn by showing them compassion. Isn't this a bit circular? We need miserable people in the world so happy people have someone to show compassion for. What then is the purpose of happy people? So we have someone to rescue miserable people?<br />Eadie's view of the afterlife is full of dualism. Good angels fight evil spirits. We are all beset by evil but have only to trust our guardian angels to protect us. Eadie saw nasty evil spirits as well as good ones. The afterlife is apparently a battlefield. I found her whole vision inconsistent and unbelievable.<br />The only relief from the string of ridiculous afterlife scenarios was the last part, where Eadie takes in an unwanted child, then later rescues her from abusive relatives. Yes, I found that touching and I applaud her actions in seeing her spiritual connection to this child. This may be a woman with good intentions but a poor memory of what actually happened that night in the hospital. I cannot bring myself to be a total cynic about Eadie's vision, but I think most of it is just not so.
6305546797|5.0|If I were asked to list the top scary movies of all time, I would place John Carpenter's Halloween at the top of my list.  It is much scarier than Psycho and The Exorcist, in my opinion, and the likes of Jason and Freddy pale in comparison to Michael Myers.  Its influence on the genre can hardly be overstated; countless slasher films have been released over the last two decades plus, wherein each filmmaker consciously or unconsciously has tried to duplicate the force and power of this 1978 masterpiece of terror and suspense.  It is this movie's genre-defining influence that earns it first place in my rankings.<br />Is the movie scary?  Yes, emphatically so.  All these years later, with audiences having a number of other slasher films under their belt, Halloween may not seem as frightening as it had to have been when it was released, but it is deliciously scary nonetheless.  The groundbreaking point of view shots Cameron employs only adds to the incredible suspense of the story.  Watching this movie alone in a dark room is probably a pretty bad idea, as is going to bed immediately afterwards.  Nick Castle's portrayal of Michael is brilliantly subtle, and the photography and soundtrack are superb.  The image of the featureless, pasty-white mask hovering above a dark set of clothes is unnerving, and the early sightings of him in Haddenfield are amazingly effective-even when you know he is there, it is sometimes difficult to spot him.  One of the best scenes later on has Michael creeping out of a darkened room; it is as if the mask just somehow emerges out of nowhere from the shadows.  Even Michael's walk and method of suddenly sitting straight up out of a prone position are amazingly impactful.  He really does seem to represent true evil, a force of nature that keeps coming and coming all the time yet is entirely human.  He is everywhere and nowhere.  The musical score is beyond outstanding; the famous Halloween theme is immediately recognizable whenever you hear it, taking you directly back to Haddonfield.  Halloween was the first true horror movie I ever watched.  I was probably around twelve at the time, and I decided I was going to watch my first horror film the proper way-in the dark, late at night.  I am embarrassed to say that I never even made it through the opening credits.  That jack o'lantern and incredibly creepy music scared the daylights out of me.<br />While Michael is horror's most terrifying killer, Halloween would not have seen nearly as much success had it not been for Donald Pleasance's character Dr. Loomis.  Loomis' brilliant acting and forceful presence gives Halloween something its imitators don't have, and his almost philosophical musings on Michael's innate evil give this killer a depth that other slasher villains just don't possess.  Jamie Lee Curtis, of course, was also fabulous in this, her first movie role.  No other scream queen can boast of such advanced acting skills.  I didn't think the acting jobs of the other teenagers were very good, but those characters were in the movie for one reason only, and it wasn't to steal the show.<br />The extra features on the limited edition release are pretty good.  The \\"Halloween Unmasked\\" featurette from 1998 delivers interviews with cast and creators (including an unmasked Nick Castle, who looks more like a professor than a \\"killer\\").  The extras also include several scenes shot in 1982 and added to the television version of the movie.  The first of these provides more detail about Michael's original transfer to a minimum security institution and Dr. Loomis' attempts to prevent it from taking place.  The second one is a great scene featuring Loomis telling the teenaged, pseudo-comatose Michael that he may have fooled the hospital administrators but he hasn't fooled him.  The third offers a bit of unnecessary data on Michael's motivations.  The fourth scene features some extended dialogue between the movie's three teenaged girls and is forgettable at best.  WhatI found most interesting was the story of Halloween's origins.  Many have forgotten or never even knew how much of a surprise hit this movie was in 1978.  It was filmed over the course of just three weeks with a total budget of little more than three hundred thousand dollars.  Donald Pleasance filmed all of his scenes in a mere five days.  The history of Halloween is really remarkable, especially when you consider the importance and influence of this movie on the genre.  John Carpenter managed to bring together everything a horror film needs to succeed, and the entire industry has been trying to match his efforts without complete success ever since.What I found most interesting was the story of Halloween's origins.

B00003CXAE|3.0|I am in complete and utter awe of this movie.  I don't believe there is any other film in history that has matched Grease's ability to mess around with its audience's expectations and perceptions.  So many people finish watching this film feeling like they have just gone through a very cheerful and life-affirming experience.  But look at the film's actual plots!<br />1. (The main storyline): Olivia Newton John learns that in order to become popular in highschool and win back the love of the man she had a summer fling with, she must make it obvious to the whole school that she is willing to put out.  Until she does this, John Travolta risks being ostracized and ridiculed by his male friends for dating a woman for purely emotional reasons. Since Travolta is the one that she wants, O.N.J. decides she must cater to his needs and very publically presents herself in her new role as a leather-clad boytoy at a fair (I still can't decide if this storyline is more insulting to males or females); and<br />2. (the main subplot) A girl who gets pregnant because she has unprotected sex in the back seat of a car with one of Travolta's friends (she apparently learned earlier than O.N.J. how to be popular) has to choose between dropping out of school and getting a job (by way of graduating beauty school) so she can take care of her baby, or, alternatively, have an abortion so she can return to highschool.  Meanwhile, the boyfriend who dumped her after she got pregnant is one of guys accusing Travolta of a lapse in judgement for falling in love with O.N.J.<br />Oh yeah.  And there's a dance contest!  (Perhaps if Scorcese had added a hand-jiving scene to \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" he could have avoided the whole controversy.)<br />But because this extremely cynical story is set to catchy bubble-gum music and is filled with colourful images of a 1950s America that has never existed anywhere outside of theme diners of the 1980s, almost everyone misses the point! As a result, this film is widely loved, even by people who would ordinarily refuse to consider going to a depressing, sexist or \\"morally questionable\\" movie.  Which all goes to prove that in order to have a hit movie, sometimes all that is necessary is an easily forgettable plot wrapped up in distracting spectacle!<br />However, as cynical and unrealistic as Grease may be, it is a fun exploitation film. But it only gets 3 stars because there are many juvenile delinquency films which were actually made in the 1950s that are far superior.  Sure, they're not much more realistic, but they're entertaining, not because of their insincerity, but because they try so hard to be sincere.
0792844602|5.0|This film has been remade by Hollywood twice with disastrous results.  The original is still formidable.  I have it on Beta and I saw the original as one of the first color pictures I can remember seeing.  It should be duck soup for modern technology to recreate it in at least as good shape as it was originally without trying to change it in any other way. As I recall, the desert photography had the superb realistic quality seldom seen elsewhere (maybe Lawrence of Arabia).  It ought to be a smash hit again - especially in today's world where the &quot;thin red line&quot; has been replaced by the &quot;thin red, white and blue line.&quot;
B000002UA2|5.0|1972's \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is a very overlooked Pink Floyd album---it's essentially a soundtrack album to a little-seen French film, \\"The Valley,\\" and it's sandwiched between two Floyd albums that are much more popular, 1971's \\"Meddle,\\" and the legendary 1973 release that is \\"Dark Side Of The Moon.\\" But mark my words, \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is a stunning Floyd album that's just as strong as any of the band's well-known classics.The opening two-in-one instrumental, \\"Obscured By Clouds/When You're In\\" is one of my all-time favorite Floyd pieces. The first half starts out very hypnotically, with a pulsing rhythm and David Gilmour's searing guitar coloring it in all the right spots. Then it fades, and the band roar right back into it, full-throttle, with a gloriously rocking second half. Other highlights include the fine rockers \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" & \\"Childhood's End,\\" the whimsical \\"Wots...Uh The Deal,\\" \\"Free Four,\\" a light-hearted Roger Waters tune about death, the lovely \\"Stay,\\" which is a great showcase number for keyboardist/vocalist Richard Wright, and the atmospheric finale, \\"Absolutely Curtains.\\"\\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is truly an obscured Pink Floyd album, but it is without question one of their best. As the album that came just before \\"Dark Side,\\" it captures the band knocking on the door to rock immortality with an album that's just as good as that legendary monster. \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" is a marvelous buried treasure from Pink Floyd. Buy it! :-)
B000002GK1|5.0|Well had some badmoterfingers. Since the brake up of sound garden around 1997, i feel and i'm sure among quite a few others that it was quite a waste. But reading interviews,articles and such the members of SG unfortunately never planed soundgarden to be a very long prodject. I mean running 12 years or more they could of made it an even 22. Enough with the irrealavantcy and lets just get to the album. I obtained this album about a month or two ago and I must say that this is one of the most kick buttearly 1990's rock albums I have ever had the fortune and pleasure to listen to. Infact one could say that this album represented the peak of soundgarden's musical career, that statement indeed is pretty dam acurate within it self. I have not heard all the songs off all the soundgarden albums, but I have a-sides, this one, louder than love(just by sheer luck from a circuit city selection, wouldint you belive it was the only one left?)and superunknown. I have heard various songs from there fopp,louder than love,ultramega Ok so I can at least make a pretty acurate judgement. But with this album, to me it just flows musicly better than that of superunknown and the meterial from there earlyer days, not to say that thos albums were sub-par, they were great in there own ways. You get into songs like the grinding rusty cage, outshined(one of my favorite SG songs), slaves and bulldozers and so on. I guess the thing that intrests me the most about soundgarden, or the rest of the early 1990's rock bands is chris cornells intencely insane soaring choruses. Another thing is his writing style. Just briaint it it's own way, I love his metaphors, and ability's to turn something kinda dull and turn it into something really cool. Songs like rusty cage, mind riot, drowning flies etc are prime examples of this. So inconclusion, if you want a superb, and hardrockin rock album or grunge album i would definetly aquire a copy of this. Definetly a sonic experience.
0380820846|4.0|If you like the format of Ms. Quinn's other books you will most likely enjoy this one.  The characters from past books are present, yet the focus is always on the current characters, Colin and Penelope. The interaction of characters is wonderful and the Bridgerton family is both amusing and complex. <BR>Events from the earlier books are revisited so the first time reader will not be lost by the &quot;flashbacks&quot; of the characters. The romance is sweet, a little hurried in my opinion, but the characters have known each for so long that I found it excusable.  This is not great literature, nor is it intended to be.  It is an enjoyable read that will remain on my bookshelf along with Ms. Quinn's other books.
0790744295|3.0|What I love most about \\"Creepshow\\" is the homage it pays to the EC comics of the1950's, of which I have always been a fan. That, and the fact that I have enjoyed every single George Romero movie to date, when the ones fans and critics hated. Since the movie is told in a comic book style narrative, with 5 separate stories, I will review it as such:<br />1. Father's Day. Your classic EC story of revenge from the grave. Nathan, the patriarch of a wealthy family, was murdered by his daughter on father's day. When the family gathers for their annual celebration, he decides to seek his revenge from beyond the grave. Let's just say that he want's to have his cake, and eat it to. Standard horror comic formula has it's moments, one of which is a young Ed Harris, but is nothing special. ***<br />2. The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verril. Stephen King himself flexes his comis muscle as  a less-than-bright country bumpkin who discovers a meteor in his back yard one night, and upon touching it, starts to sprout green plants. His fate is sealed as he so aptly states \\"I'm growing\\". Is the funniest of the lot, with a bit of horror and a bit of absurdity. ***<br />3. The Crate. When a Janitor finds an empty crate under the stairs of a local university, one man must deal with the consequences of what he unleashes when he opens it. Apparently, it contains a prehistoric beast that can devour a human whole. What the man also contends with is his obnoxious, alcoholic wife (played very well by Adrienne Barbeau). How can he solve both problems? The is probably the best story in the whole movie, and by far the bloodiest. ****<br />4. Something To Tide you Over. Wentworth (Ted Danson) intends on marrying Rebecca (Romero regular Gaylen Ross). One problem is her current husband, Richard (Leslie Nielson), he is a little less than sane. When he kidnaps Rebecca, Wentworth must save her. But in order to do so, he must go through what she does. Richard lives on the ocean, in which the tide is an ominous sign of things to come. One of the most serious and terrifying stories in this movie. Good performances all around, but it is very similar to the first story. ***<br />5. They're Creeping Up On You. Upson Pratt (E.G. Marshall is a standout performance) is an obsessive-compulsive millionaire who lives in an incubated, germ-proof apartment. The only problem is that he is infested with cockroaches, lots of them. On the eve of a hostile takeover by his company, his cockroach problem intensifies. His evil ways are about to be punished at the hands of thousands of roaches. Definitely the most skin-crawling of all the stories, and my personal favorite. This one you have to see to believe. ****<br />The DVD package is what keeps this from being a 4 or 5 star review. It is barren of anything other than the movie and an attractive widescreen transfer. The only special feature is a theatrical trailer. Other than that, there is nothing. Worse yet, Warner (as is their habit) released this movie in a cheap \\"Snapper\\" case, which is cheap cardboard with a plastic frame. This always kills it for me. Other than that, the movie is fine, and still one of my favorite Halloween party movies. Filled with fine acting, writing, and imaginative directing by Romero, this movie is a winner.ous sign of things to come. One of the most serious and terrifying stories in this movie.

B00005QIPH|4.0|Probably one of the most hyped indie albums of the decade, while the Strokes don't look like they made quite the impact critics believed they would five years ago, it did help them become the ultimate hipsters for awhile. And these 11 songs aren't really profound, deep, or anything like that. Lyrically, it reminds me of the obscurity of old R.E.M., and while I don't enjoy every song on here, there is definite highlights. You'll be repeating \\"Barely Legal\\" and \\"Hard to Explain\\" the most, since those two are where they get the formula right. The other songs are good, too, but those are the more instantly memorable ones. I also like the sequel \\"Room on Fire\\", although I'm kind of mixed on the new one. Seems like it's one of those times where the band was better using the formula.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I am a little angry at some of the reviews out there. What is the matter with everyone? Sea Change is a beautiful piece. A masterwork! At first, I was not sure I would like the CD. However, now that I have listened to it many times; I have found a treasure. And the treasure is for all of us to enjoy. No, it is far from Loser and Odeley. Now I hear the early 1970's. Being inspiried by Gordon Lightfoot it appears. And many other 70's ballad makers. I am a songwiter and I predict this CD will win Grammy Awards and other Awards. This CD is a SLEEPER. Watch what happens. Beck is showing us his talent in another lasting form. He has shown us he is still one of the greatest talents today. I say to you again Beck Hansen. Bravo!

B00003CWTI|1.0|Really! This movie has impact and impressive enough acting, but is it really worth praising with SO MANY MISTAKES? The worst movie I ever saw was &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; because it glorified violence with villains so just cruel, selfish and blatantly undisturbed by their actions that I could not find anything redeeming about the film's &quot;message.&quot; It could be argued that &quot;Magnolia&quot; and the other abomination I just described are clever and have &quot;artistic&quot; merit. I say PHOOEY TO YOU! Even though I liked particular actors in the picture and was able to at least sit in the theater for three hours waiting for a conclusion to the various plots, the &quot;reptile storm&quot; was both unnecessary and poorly executed, propelling this movie from a bad film to a truly despicable one. I couldn't help but think how cheated I felt out of the three hours of my life taken from me from this meaningless and ultimately dismal picture. Best Picture of 1999? PHOOEY!
B00005JKZ2|2.0|There is a sad fact about movies: If it makes money, it'll likely get a cashin sequel. Even remakes like Doctor Dolittle manage it - anything to bring in a few extra bucks. But when 5 years exist between original and sequel, surely it's not a case of acute cashin sequilitis?<BR>   Alas, yes. This movie took similar time to materialise to Star Wars Episode I... yet somehow, it still managed to add so very little to the excellent film that was Men In Black. Now there was a class act of a blockbuster. Decent effects, yes, but it boasted Tommy Lee Jones' fantastic restrained-yet-hilarious performance, delivering excellent lines with perfect speed; it had a decent script; and obviously it offered a new slant on the alien conspiracy theory idea. It was great, even ending with a lovely unnecessary but really effective existencial visual. <BR>   MIB2 falls flat on its face because, instead of saying \\"Hey, what more could happen with the Men in Black,\\" they simply re-do the original film, albeit with less impact and a far-too-great sense of self mockery. The list of problems is as follows: The story is a virtual rewrite. \\"The Galaxy\\" is substituted for \\"The Light\\" (quite what said Light is, we are not told); The Bug is substituted for Serleena; The new/old agent theme is still present, albeit the roles are reversed; the story takes similar turns, though slower, with a similar (admittadly effective) ending visual of a similarly perspective-setting nature.<BR>   Next, Tommy Lee Jones. Before he was restrained and sardonic, for me the highlight of Men in Black... here, he simply looks bored for the duration of his scenes. Clearly just roped in for the cash, and to rescue an already bleak so-called \\"plot,\\" he seems incapable of that lightning-fast delivery we were so gifted with last time. Will Smith dumbs down his character to seem ever inferior to Jones, which doesn't help his already \\"love him or hate him\\" fan status. <BR>   Then, there's the humour. Yes, there's one or two decent lines - the majority of them from Smith after neuralising someone - but there's simply too much of it. Everyone's playing for laughs, even Rip Torn's Z (in a cringe-inducingly awful karate scene), and there are pointless cameos from the likes of Michael Jackson (a wasted oppertunity) and Tony Shalhoub's Jeeves (who simply rehashes the head-shooting joke from the first movie). It tries so hard to amuse, it ends up a simple mockery of the whole concept. The other agents are feeble, one bursting into tears for no reason, the others cowering at the sight of Tommy Lee Jones' character. Humour is a good thing, but constant?<BR>   Lastly, there's the fact that it could actually have been really good. The film's only decent ideas (Jeffrey the Subway Worm; A super-fast multi-limbed postal worker; The Statue of Liberty neuraliser, etc) are ignored, forgotten or plain wasted. This is in line with various plot mistakes (the guy with two heads disappeared between scenes, not to be seen again) and just acts to annoy us that this film was so nearly a riot. <BR>   Why did it take 5 years to produce something we'd expect them to take 2 years to do? It's a tired cashin. Even Danny Elfman's music doesn't inspire, and armed with some hefty visuals (one or two actually coming off well, particularly the hilarious \\"race who live in a locker\\" scenes) it has the look of what it is: The \\"bigger, louder sequel\\" that accompanies ANY film these days.<BR>   It's a let down. Worse than that, it's so short that the action slugs along and takes a final mad dash in the closing reel. Do yourself a favour and stay happy with the far superior original.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Having seen (and owned) \\"Evil Dead\\" in many different forms, it is nice to finally get an all-inclusive version. Anchor Bay is notorious for lousy video transfers (the VHS version of Halloween), but this one is surprisingly good. This neat little \\"Book of the Dead\\" is a great collectible, assuming you have the cash for it.<br />Rather than give a plot synopsis (if you are reading this, chances are youve seen the movie many times), I will say that this is the only real \\"Horror\\" movie in the Evil Dead Trilogy. While \\"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn\\" and the later \\"Army of Darkness\\" were more comedy than horror, the first installment is a strait-forward horror outing. What sets it apart from other 80s horror movies is Sam Raimis stylish direction and Tom Sullivans extremely gross special effects. \\"Evil Dead\\" is perhaps the goriest of all the 1980s horror flicks, with blood, guts, and body parts flying everywhere. But it is done in such a way as to make it a stylish horror movie, not a snuff film like a lot of early 80s \\"Video Nasties\\".<br />Anchor Bay gave us quite a package with this edition, so fans of the series can rejoice. Included are no less than 2 documentaries, one by Bruce Campbell himself called \\"Fanalysis\\", which give an insight into the world of fandom as seen at conventions. Campbell makes a piece similar to that is \\"Trekkies\\", showing all types, and all degrees, of fans. The \\"Evil.Dead\\" fans, by the looks of things, are the most civilized out of the bunch. The second documentary is called \\"Discovering Evil Dead\\", which has interviews with two early proprietors of home video who discovered \\"Evil Dead\\", and were responsible for getting it released to the general public. Also included are the outtakes, bios, trailers, and other supplements.<br />The quality of the movie itself it nice, even though I have heard people complain about the \\"matted\\" widescreen. The only other prints I have to compare it to are the Thorn EMI release from the early 80s, and Anchor Bays abysmal re-release that I bought in 1998. The image is clear, but a bit grainy in parts. This is to be expected in a print as old as this, and especially in low-budget movies, also like this. I have always loved \\"Evil Dead\\", and am happy that I now own it on DVD<br />My biggest complaint is the price tag, which is steep no matter how you look at it. This costs as much as some DVD box sets, and considering the extras, this is still only 1 DVD with a fancy book included.

B00003CXZ4|1.0|Excrutiating. Boring. Pointless. These are the adjectives that beat like a slow loungy postmodern wipeout in my brain from 5 minutes into this mess. I know I was supposed to like it because all my male friends with scruffy French-influenced facial hair and all my female friends with rings in their nose said it was the bomb. But my patience with a movie that won't meet me half way is nil to begin with. I could hear the director saying, \\"Forget 'em if they can't take a joke! It doesn't have to make sense, it's art!\\" all the way through.<br />I don't care if \\"there is no flaw\\" as the spammer says. Don't care if it was a dazzling job of direction and editing. Don't care if the main actor was convincing in a sweaty desperate way that we've all come to love since Survivor hit the air. Because of the structure, none of it makes sense for more than 30 seconds at a time. That seems to be the point. Let's make a movie that doesn't hang together. We are way more lost than the narrator, who at least may have had the luxury of asking the director what he meant be all that. It is a pinata of a film: the director blindfolds us, spins us around until we are dizzy, and then pushes us at the thing we are supposed to get.<br />After this film, I was seized by the impulse to rush to a tattoo place and have \\"Don't go to any Christopher Nolan film ever again\\" and \\"Go to theater and demand money back\\" inked into my forearms. Then it hit me  \\"Life imitates Art\\". Like OMG!! Is that ironic or what?!?

B00003CX8Y|5.0|How can you not love this movie? It is such a beautiful story. I love that the DVD has 3 versions- even though the special edition is my favorite. The bonus dvd is full of fun activities and facts. I found I am most like Belle, dh like Cogsworth and dd fifi the feather duster.
B00003BDXG|1.0|If you want to see a movie that shows some insight into human emotions and questions motives of different types of individuals, particularly those involved one way or another with illegal activities, I recommend &quot;The Concrete Jungle.&quot; Oliver Stone missed the mark on this one and just satisfied his unhealthy fascination with violence.Really! This movie has impact and impressive enough acting, but is it really worth praising with SO MANY MISTAKES? &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; glorifies violence with villains so cruel, selfish and blatantly undisturbed by their actions that I could not find anything redeeming about the film's &quot;message.&quot; It could be argued that &quot;Magnolia&quot; and this absolute abomination are &quot;clever&quot; and have &quot;artistic&quot; merit. I say PHOOEY TO YOU! Even though I liked particular actors in the picture and was able to at least watch <BR>the events for a conclusion, I couldn't help but think how cheated I felt out of the two hours of my life taken from me from this meaningless and ultimately dismal picture. Brillant? PHOOEY!
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park's 1st full length release is very, very good.  Has a rap-metal sound.
0590353403|4.0|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling tells the story of an ordinary young boy who discovers that, he is not at all ordinary. Before his great self-discovery, Harry lived a very miserable life from the time he was left on the doorstep of his uncle Vernon and aunt Petunia's home when he was just a baby. Growing up, he was told that his parents had died in a car accident, which he survived, leaving a lightening shaped scar on his forehead. When Harry turned eleven, his life changed completely. He received a letter from Hogwart's, school of wizardry! When he attended the school, he discovered many other things about his life, such as, the fact that he was a wizard. He didn't take long to realize that he was famous from the time he was still a baby, for he was believed to be the baby who survived the attack of a very evil wizard, who had killed Harry's parents. Harry also realized that there are a few of those who disliked his popularity; one happened to be his potions teacher, Professor Snape. Also, he is about to have a very challenging adventure for the first time in his life, which involves stopping the man who tried to kill him from getting the Philosopher's Stone, a very valuable and powerful stone that gives its owner immortality.<br />Overall, I find this novel to be truly unique. The author managed to balance out reality and fantasy all in one book, without making it boring or over exaggerated. The plot itself is already very different from other fantasy books that I've read. It's funny and full of mysteries that keeps you excited and wanting to know what will happen next. Also, there are many thoughtful morals that we could actually apply to our daily lives, which are expressed through the actions of the characters rather than being expressed through dialogue. I find it very impressive, because writing like this is not really an easy thing to do. The author's ideas keep flowing all the time, as we can see her vision of the \\"Magic World\\" forming little by little through her words, making you feel as if you're standing right there, witnessing the whole event. <br />When speaking of fantasy books, you'd probably think it's something for small children to read and that adults are too grown up for that kind of stories. This novel, however, has proven that it's not just a novel for kids, but it's for everyone to read, even adults. As for people who don't normally read this type of story, I'm sure that once you've read it, you'll surely enjoy it. I would recommend this novel to those who love to read fantasy books, or anyone who doesn't like to read anything too serious and enjoys a bit of comedy. People who still don't like to read fantasy books no matter what, you may not enjoy this, because there's still a great deal of imaginary bits in it also.
B00005JKNF|5.0|I have seen this 3 times and plan to watch yet again.  I also love the soundtrack - the Ivor Novello songs are worth it alone.
0060987464|2.0|Marilyn Manson could not get an worse. I only read this book to see why Marilyn Manson is the way he is and I got all my answers. I mean it was like reading a Stephen King novel. Just one creeping book that haunts you at night. I heard that Marilyn was going to kill himself like 5 halloween nights ago but unfortunately, NO. I bet he likes being called the freak of the century though. And writing this review doesn't help because all you pot smoking Marilyn Manson fans can't read anyway. I mean, jeez, whiping his bum-bum with the American Flag? Ripping apart puppies on stage? What's America come too?

B00005NWM3|3.0|&quot;Silver Side Up&quot;, Nickelback's third full-length release, is good, but not great.  Better than &quot;The State&quot;, and it holds a great song, &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I'm a hairstylist, and this makes for a great easy listening/background music CD for at work. I would be hard pressed to rock out to it though or even get really excited about listening to it.  I would not listen to it at home unless I was having a dinner party.
B00005J6UP|5.0|When I first saw this movie on the Disney Channel late one night, I fell in love with it, though I only saw about 2/3rds of it. A few months after that I found a \\"What Goonie are you?\\" quiz on a site and decided right away I wanted to get the movie so I could see it all. I bought the VHS and when that didn't work in any VCR I was pretty upset. I returned it and about 3 days later I found the DVD ... so I *had* to get it. I ADORE the scene with the Truffle Shuffle and Mouth in Spanish. Heh, gotta love Corey Feldman :). The commentary is great! I loved seeing all the actors as they are now! Too bad Sean left in the middle of it. The deleted scenes are terrific, I actually saw the octopus scene on the Disney channel, I didn't know it was cut from the original movie. Hopefully they will put Goonies back in theaters one day, then I shall ...drag all my friends along when I go see it >:). I annoy them every day by quoting Mouth or by talking about my favorite scenes. I even memorised the Goonies Oath. Well, all in all, The Goonies is a GREAT, timeless movie that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime... or they can watch it everyday like I do. :)
B000001ESP|5.0|One of Rush's best albums -- if not *the* best. In terms of sound, it achieves what I think is the optimum balance between Alex Lifeson's guitar riffs, Geddy Lee's bass and keyboard playing, and Nearl Peart's virtuosic drumming. In terms of songwriting, the songs are accessible yet thought-provoking.<br />Overall, an album that was great to start with and which continues to get better with age.
6300151379|5.0|Jim Henson, creator of the muppets, creates a film about goblins and a world of imagination. David Bowie stars as The Goblin King, an evil king who slaves (including Goblins) work for. Jennifer Connelly (Higher Learning) plays Sarah, a frustrated teen baby-sitting her little brother, who, after reading her favorite book, \\"Labyrinth\\", asks the Goblins to come take her little brother away. When they do, the Goblin King comes and tells Sarah if she wants her little brother back, she has to go his castle, through his labyrinth, a place of mazes and adventures, where she befriends goblins and creatures. This movie is great for anybody. I remember seeing this at the movies when I was 8 and own the video and DVD. It's just too excellent to hate.
B0000029AP|3.0|&quot;Toys in the attic&quot; is truly a great release, and worth every penny.  Rock sound, and crazy vocals.
B0000256VK|4.0|This album (the last Roxy Music) was made at Compass Point studio, like Flesh and Blood, but it sounds more mature than that. I really like the singles (More than this, Avalon and Take a chance with me) and I think it's their best work. Very logical that the last album is the best, it should have been for every group/artist!!! This one grows quickly on you, but there are instant favourites and I mentioned them before...MASTERPIECE...
6301763041|5.0|This movie is one of the funniest and wittiest movies I have seen.  Yes it is silly, maybe dumb in some parts, but every once in awhile you need a movie like this to remind us not to take life so seriously!  Johnny Depp is beautiful and fabulous in this movie as well as the rest of the cast, including the gorgeous and talented Amy Locane.  Its one of those movies you can watch again and again, learn the words and sing along!  <BR>So if you haven't seen it yet, expect the unexpected like you would from any John Waters movie, but also be prepared to laugh and feel for the characters!
B000003BEV|4.0|Although regarded by many as the Rolling Stones' psychedelic skeleton in the closet, \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" is actually VERY different from the album it is ENDLESSLY and unfavorably compared to, the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.\\"  \\"Satanic Majesties\\" was NEVER meant to be anything other than a parody of the whole nonsense 60's message of drug-drenched peace, love, and harmony.  Most revelatory on this unfairly criticized album is the work of Brian Jones.<BR>Brian warned his bandmates that psychedelia and the whole psychedelic movement would be over soon and to spend any length of time on an album celebrating what amounted to nothing more than a misguided fad could be detrimental.  Brian's sage warnings went unheeded.  Brian played very little guitar on the album, apart from some excellent electric guitar flourishes on \\"2000 Man.\\"  Instead he played the Mellotron (a type of analogue synthesizer), an electronic instrument panel, harp, sitar, keyboards, woodwinds of all kinds, and just about anything else on the album that the listener picks up in the layers of sounds.  Mick Jagger once said, \\"just about everything you hear on that album is Brian.\\"<BR>It took time for people to recognize that this was the Stones literally making fun of the whole psychedelic era.  \\"2000 Man\\" is almost prophetic, with children of the year 2000 asking their baby boomer relatives these pointed lyrics from the song: \\"oh daddy is your brain still flashing, like it did when you were young?  Or did you come down crashing, seeing all the things you done?  Oh, it's a big put-on.\\"<BR>And for those of us that are the generation that came on the scene immediately AFTER the baby boomers (this writer was born in 1967), it is INDEED a big put on, and the Stones knew this in 1967.<BR>This isn't \\"Sgt. Pepper.\\"  The Stones didn't care if \\"She's Leaving Home\\" or not.  They were unlikely to attend a benefit for Mister Kite, and the heaviness of \\"Satanic Majesties\\" does make \\"When I'm 64\\" sound exactly like what John Lennon said it was, a nice little song \\"for the grannies to dig.\\"<BR>Love this album.  Hate this album.  But whatever you do, DON'T compare it to Sgt. Pepper.  There were never two albums more different from each other.  Pepper is brilliant, no doubt about it, but for my generation it is BEYOND over-rated.  Feel what you want about \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request,\\" but do NOT underestimate it.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|A great way to open a collection!!! A must-have for everybody!
6304082428|5.0|Even though I confess I have not read any of the works of Jane Austen, I can still appreciate something that is obviously good literature, with incomparable richness of language; and that is here paired in a movie series unlike any other before and for future years to come as well.<br />Jennifer Ehle in her role of Elizabeth Bennett has all the charm, wit and articulation that is appropriately required, and so does the proud Mr. Darcy, played by whom I consider one of the most good-looking and most eloquent British actors of the day: Colin Firth. When I saw him in &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary&quot;  I noticed his gift to play his characters in a silent way, where whether no spoken words may be necessary, his body language speaks volumes. Alison Steadman deserves an award for her performance of the annoying Mrs. Bennett; just as her husband, played by Benjamin Whitrow, makes himself dear to us all in his role as head of a family with the responsibility of having to care for them as both mother and father.<br />And Pemberley! Well, one can only gasp - just as Elizabeth does, when she sees the old English mansion from the angle of her chariot to find it purely breathtaking.<br />This is a fine production where not only the great storyline deserves watching but the details of the costumes, the city life, the countryside and, yes, the manners of the time make it worthwhile to watch time and time again. For lovers of language as well as for the romantics at heart, &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; will not disappoint.
B000003KCU|4.0|This film may have had nothing to do with Walt Disney studios, but every aspect of its production hearkens back to &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; I watched so faithfully back in the 1960's. And yet, it doesn't feel dated. One might call it a children's sci-fi &quot;coming of age&quot; movie.&quot; The alien kids' infatuation with old pop-culture TV may have been anti-climactic, but its timeless view of youthful innocence strikes a chord with many of us.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|When Jack Haley, Jr., decided to create the first volume in this documentary franchise, it was a colossal gamble: movie nostalgia wasn't much followed in 1974.  Now, of course, we look about us and see that Haley started something big.  And in this box set all three of the TE documentaries are available for a single reasonable price.  \\"You can wait around and hope,\\" says Frank Sinatra in one of his introductory spiels, \\"but I tell ya, you'll never see the like of this again.\\"      The same could be said of almost every clip in \\"That's Entertainment,\\" first of these compilations of MGM musical highlights, ranging from an achingly bad chorus-girl number from the \\"Broadway Melody of 1930\\" (the first all-sound musical) to numbers from [[ASIN:B00006DEF9 Singin' in the Rain (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and the climactic ballet from [[ASIN:B001BHI0JE An American in Paris (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  In between, the movie hits dozens of high spots in the 40-odd-year history of MGM as *the* studio for musicals--and also delivers a few surprises, like Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable doing turns in the genre (surprisingly, not too shabbily).  Energetic Busby Berkeley ensembles, black-and-white set-pieces from the '30's, a romantic duo by Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse, every type of musical number is represented, with narrative material by Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Bing Crosby, Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor, Peter Lawford, Mickey Rooney, Jimmy Stewart, Donald O'Connor, Liza Minnelli, and Sinatra.      In Part 2, filmed two years later, the entertainment theme is expanded upon with scenes featuring Clark Gable, the Marx Brothers, Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan, W. C. Fields in [[ASIN:B000GRUQK6 David Copperfield (1935)]], Tracy and Hepburn singly and together, the \\"Thin Man\\" series, and Roddy McDowell in [[ASIN:B000294U5A Lassie Come Home]], as well as new introductory scenes filmed in Paris and musical tributes to such great names as Sinatra, Maurice Chevalier, and [[ASIN:B0007YXPKQ The Band Wagon (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  Narration is provided by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly (the latter still spry enough to hoof lightly at 75), and Kelly gets his wish, as expressed in the first film, that they might dance together again.    Part 3 was released in 1994 as part of MGM's 70th-anniversary celebration and features narration by Gene Kelly (who basically tells the history of musicals from 1929-34), Cyd Charisse (a tribute to Kelly), Debbie Reynolds (the \\"glamorous women\\" of the studio and the Latin craze of the '40's), Mickey Rooney (on his dear friend Judy Garland), Ann Miller (on Astaire), Esther Williams, June Allyson, and Howard Keel (on the new technologies of the '50's).  While a few of Williams's scenes appeared in the previous two chapters, there are also numerous sequences that were cut from the final prints of movies, including an impressive nighttime number from [[ASIN:B00005Y71M The Harvey Girls]] and two numbers that were filmed for [[ASIN:B00003CWLI Annie Get Your Gun]] with Judy Garland in the role that later became Betty Hutton's.    Besides these, a fourth DVD includes three short documentaries about MGM and its films.  Two of them are basically studio events and not particularly interesting unless you're into celebrity-watching, though the third, \\"Behind the Scenes,\\" which was filmed for the premiere of Part 3, includes interesting interview material with the movie's narrators, director, editor, and producers, including reminiscences of L. B. Mayer (most of them liked him, except Kelly) and Judy Garland, their experiences at MGM, and how musicals might be done again.  But I think they might just as well have put this material on the disc with the movie itself, omitted the other two shorts entirely, and included [[ASIN:B00005JNIU That's Dancing!]] in the set instead.  This much being said, however, the movies themselves are great nostalgic fun.  Whether you're an old buff looking to enjoy a few favorites without having tokeep changing the video, or a novice wondering what all the fuss was about and what films might best serve as the foundation of your collection, this set should definitely be on your shelf.

B000068TPN|5.0|Fantastic storytelling!  Fantastic filmwork! Fantastic acting!<br />This is a terrific film.  It moved me to great emotion.  <br />One aspect worth appreciation in this film is the positive portrayal of American soldiers.  So many other Vietnam war movies ask us to believe that \\"all\\" of our men were using drugs, defiling every living female, and murdering officers.  Although these things happened, I would like to believe that American fighting men were and are honorable.<br />This film will go down as one of the great war stories of our time.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you've ever seen and loved the classic Halloween special \\"The Worst Witch,\\" starring a young miss Fairuza Balk, Harry Potter should strike a familiar chord with you.  Though I have yet to read the Harry Potter books, it's my love for fantasies like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and Halloween specials like \\"The Worst Witch\\" that drew me to this film, and I'm so glad! Harry Potter is the fantastic and fun-filled story of a young boy whose miserable life as an orphan living with cruel relatives is suddenly changed when he finds out he is destined to be the greatest Wizard that ever was! Living in a crawl space under his Aunt and Uncle's staircase in 20th century London, Harry has no idea that his parents were a famous Wizard and Witch, murdered by an evil Wizard when he was just a baby. But one day a mysterious letter comes for Harry, informing him that he is soon to be a student at Hogwart's School of Magic. His aunt and uncle do their best to keep him away, but goodness wins out when the towering, bearded, kindhearted and commanding Hagrid comes to the Human world to save the boy from his coldhearted keepers. Suddenly, Harry finds himself being introduced to a whole new world of magic! Hagrid takes the boy to Diagon Alley, a magical marketplace, to purchase a wand and other school supplies, then on to the train station, to board the Express to Hogwart's School. On the way to his new life, Harry meets up with his two soon-to-be best friends, the friendly and true, if a bit awkward, Ron Weasley, and the cute and clever bookworm Hermione Granger (who steals the movie, thanks to the adorable Emma Watson's performance).<br />  From that first view of Diagon Alley onward, Harry takes in one jaw-dropping experience after another. But the greatest sights come when Harry gets off the train and enters the world of Hogwart's School of magic. Boats must be taken to reach the school grounds, and the view is stunning. The school itself is a sight to behold, right out of a fairytale. Within, we find several other children waiting to be sorted into their teams and dorms, from the sneaky Slitherins to the noble Gryffindors. Luckily, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are grouped together on the Gryffindor team. The students meet the teachers, formalities are taken care of, a feast fit for kings is served up, and their new lives begin. From here on out it is one adventure after another, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione battle a Mountain Troll, investigate the evil Voldemort, play a stunning broomstick ballgame called Quidditch, and learn about honor, friendship, bravery, and magic, not to mention the secret of the mysterious Sorcerer`s Stone.<br />  Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is not to be missed. It's good, clean, family fun, with great characters and lots and lots of magic. Some scenes may be a bit frightening for small children, and if you have a hang-up about movies about kids going to witchcraft schools, well, I suggest you just have a talk with your kids about fantasy versus reality, because that's what this is, a fantasy. And what a fantasy! The DVD is wonderful, but I don't claim to have been as blown away by the extras disc as others have. It was okay, but for the most part it seems to have been made for little kids. But the movie is great for any age! If you love fantasies like The Wizard of Oz, Return To Oz, The Worst Witch, The Black Cauldron, Lord of the Rings, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and The Sword In the Stone, you're gonna love this!in, we find several other children waiting to be sorted into their teams and dorms, from the sneaky Slitherins to the noble Gryffindors.

B00005V1Y0|5.0|Hey I can be a cynic too. I have always hated dancing movies with a vengence. But one night while channel surfing and nursing a broken heart, I saw an advertisement saying 'Strictly Ballroom' would be on next. I am also a person who disliked 'Moulin Rouge' and I knew that this was a Baz Luhrmann film. But I decided to watch it anyway. And from the minute it began I was captivated by its dazzling visuals, amazing dance sequences and sweet, if predictable, plot. Hey, I needed a nice romance. The story revolves around potential star ballroom dancer Scott Hastings, who ruins his chance at gold by dancing his own original steps during a performance. His extremely upset partner refuses to ever dance with him again, leaving Scott without a partner to dance at the big Pan Pacifics competition. But his chance comes in an unlikely package, an ugly duckling of sorts named Fran, a beginning dancer. Against all odds, they form a talented duo. I won't say what happens at the end, but it definately left this viewer happy. An Australian off-the-wall delight, this will definately please you if you like Baz Luhrmann or dancing movies (I see this as 'Dirty Dancing' without the annoying actors and convulted plot). And if you don't like either (I didn't), if you enjoy romances or Australian cinema,it's a must see. So get on your dancing shoes, sit back, and enjoy.

B00006HBUB|3.0|The Scooby movie delivers a lot of classic Scooby fun.  Shaggy and Scooby still carry the rest of the Gang!  Like so many others, Scooby meant a lot to us as kids.  Personally, Scooby was my favorite childhood cartoon.  <br />It's too bad the innocence of the original cartoon was thrown out for 21st century \\"gottagrabyawithflesh\\" movie making.  Kid's have enough sexual influences and unfortunately this movie is no exception.  Hemn lines are too high and the ladies dresses are cut much too low.  Sexual references are very low and not problematic.<br />The movie drops rank with the cartoon with it's \\"real\\" monsters.  These particular monsters happen to be demonic.  They \\"possess\\" the bodies of all the visitors of Scary Island.  Add to this  an ancient mystic alphabet with the ability to call up an evil army to take over the world.<br />I know many would disagree and say that we are taking this too seriously, but the influences on our children's live are very serious.  <br />The show is a lot of fun and can be enjoyed if you know where it's going and what you're getting into.<br />\\"Rooby-rooby roo\\"!

6305878323|5.0|This whimsical film is one of my favorite Disney movies ever! It has aged well, and it's message (kids may sometimes need nannies, but they need their parents more) is more timely today than when this movie was made in 1964. Who hasn't wanted to jump into a chalk drawing and say \\"Super-cali-fragi-listic-expi-alidocious\\"? Who hasn't wanted to dance on the rooftops in the magical realm of the chimney sweeps? Who hasn't wanted to have a tea party on the ceiling? And (my favorite) who hasn't wanted to clean their room with just a spoonful of sugar and a snap of their fingers? Like the title character, this classic is \\"Practically Perfect in Every Way\\"!

0792833279|1.0|Get Shorty was a very disappointing movie dumped on some good actors. John Travolta, Rene Russo, and Gene Hackman do O.K. with the hopelessly aimless plot they are given. I found this movie a torture to watch. The script is very weak and what plot there is skips back and forth like a hopscotch game. There is no persuasiveness or depth to this movie. If you like well-crafted plots and movies that enable empathy with the characters, avoid this movie!
B00005MP58|5.0|On a scale of 1 to 5, this mini-series rates 100.  This is marvelous adaptation of Jane Austen's classic love story.  Everything about it is Perfectly done; the casting, acting, scenery, music, dancing, etc.  Although this mini-series is over 5 hours in length, it is so captivating that it is difficult to not watch the entire series in one sitting.  Truly a Masterpiece!
B00006F2TV|2.0|Yes, I realize it's a comic book. Yes, I realize that this is aimed at the mentality of a 12-year-old boy (and hits a bulls-eye at that!) But come on! The writers went for the obvious every single time! And the scenes that were supposed to explore the romantic tension between the hero and his beloved made me laugh out loud every single time because it was so poorly written. And what was the Green Goblin trying to accomplish anyway? For a good comic-book movie, skip this dreck. Watch Tim Burton's Batman instead.

Nate Dogg)-some great vocals from Nate Dogg who just does his thing along with a great beat and some great rhymes.<BR>3.

B0000025RI|5.0|Michael Jackson is/was an amazing artist. A top notch singer who's music will never EVER be forgotten. You couldnt forget this album even if you wanted to. The songs on this album are timeless and will ALWAYS stand the test of time. Quincy Jones is a genius. I mean how can anyone who's human not feel the rhythm in songs like \\"Billy Jean\\" and the rockus \\"Beat It\\" with the amazing guitar solo of guitar legend Eddie Van Halen. This album is as artistic as it gets. This album will move you. The songs on here will sink into your soul. Buy this album if you really want to know what a masterpiece sounds like.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I first saw Slipknot in a Circus magazine at a H-E-B grocery store a couple of years ago.  When I saw a picture of them in their masks I thought they looked pretty cool.  When I finally saved up enough money, I went to my nearest record store and bought it.  At first when I got it I just focused on the way they dress, but after actually listening to the album I just concentrated on the music and forgot about the masks.  That's where I discovered the true beauty of Slipknot's self-titled debut.  Every song on here is at its absolute best in my opinion.  I 've owned this disc the 4 times now, I gave the other 3 to a few of my friends, I guess you could say I'm spreading the joy.  I could listen to this CD over and over again and never get tired of it.  In my opinion it will go down as one the greatest metal albums of all time a CLASSIC.  Everyone and I mean everyone should own this metal masterpiece.  Please do yourself a favor and buy it immediately, you will never regret it.  Well I'll see ya later, and when I do you better have this disc in your music library.
B000002UAR|5.0|This album is most chronicled as The Beatles greatest album of all-time by critics and music historians. I have to agree with them. John Lennon and Paul McCartney prove on this album that they are unbelieveable songwriters who could compete with legends like Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys. This is when the Beatles threw away their boyband image and became true artists. George Harrison also proved that he could hang with Lennon and McCartney with his amazing song &quot;Taxman&quot;. People complain that this album would be perfect if &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; was never recorded. I wholeheartedly disagree with that. If you cant see the genius behind the song then you just dont get it. This album is a must for all Pop and Rock fans.
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron showed the world his modus operandi for the first time in this spectacular sci fi action- fest starring Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. In his first major action role as the lethal machine, who is aptly described by Michael Biehn's charcter Reese: \\"It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!\\" Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.<br />The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way. Stan Winston's animatronics used to create the Terminator are brilliant and the CG is \\"Whoa\\" material. Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well! This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made. The DVD extras are excellent too, with commentaries, 'making of's, \\"terminated\\" deleted scenes, trailers that fully capture the menace of the machine and the nerve-shredding pace of the film, production info and more. YOU MUST OWN THIS DISC.
B00005JL0I|3.0|Burt Bacharach's score for Casino Royale and Dusty Springfield's classic breathy version of the Look of Love, came to define something about the late 60s.  In fact, the LP of this movie is considered one of the standard audiophile discs used to test high-end audio systems.  It has something to do with the quality of the recording equipment used at the time.<br />BUT.... If you are renting/buying this disc in hopes of a James Bond film, you will be disappointed.  More a spoof than anything else, the movie doesn't really work on that level.  David Niven, Woody Allen and the rest of the cast are fun to watch in some spots.  But overall, it's a barely passable film.  But that score!  Even the opening number by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass will jolt you out of your chair.  <br />Classic Records released a DVD audio version of the soundtrack.  It's also available on regular CD.
B00005UW7V|5.0|Steven Spielberg's misunderstood Sci Fi masterpiece is one of the director's most ambitious projects and one of his most amazing films. Taken from the Brian Aldiss short story \\"Supertoys Last All Summer Long\\", A.I ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE was originally a project for legendary director Stanley Kubrick to direct. Most Sci Fi fans and Kubrick devotees wanted to see Kubrick direct the film, as it is perfectly aligned to his other films, notably 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br />But with Kubrick's passing, the only director on the planet capable of taking on the colossal project was Mr. Spielberg.<br />The elaborated story taken from Aldiss tale is about a robot (Or \\"Mecha\\") child named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is programmed to love. But when his adoptive parents find themselves at a loss of what to do when their real son recovers from a coma, David is abandoned into the world with the supertoy \\"Teddy\\". David's journey takes him to the violent, nihilistic Flesh Fair where he meets the smooth-talking Gigolo Joe, played brilliantly by Jude Law (Gattaca, Existenz). From there they travel to the futuristic Rouge City, accompanied by the waltz from Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss and begin their epic journey to find the Blue Fairy. John Williams' etheral score for the film is perhaps not as meorable as his most famous work, but it still moves the film forward emotionally.<br />The jarring switches from futuristic suburbia to the mecha-hating world may not sit well with some viewers, and the ending, admittedly is overly-sentimental. But it is a compelling story, and one that's a must-see on the big screen.<br />Despite the combined brilliance of the main actors, Spielberg's masterful direction and touching homages to Kubrick, the film was a commercial failure and critics were apparently put off with the film's sentimentality (Hence the shameful Academy snubs). Whether American audiences found the film too cerebral in comparison to brainless Hollywood rubbish, or the cryptic marketing campaign of posters and trailers backfired or whether people were expecting an E.T-like tale of a heart-warming adventure (And were disappointed), is debatable. But the fact remains it is a brilliant film and a must-have for Spielberg fans.<br />One of the more impressive Spielberg DVDs, this 2 Disc Collector's Edition is lacking a Director's Commentary (Spielberg apparently likes the audience to have their own opinion) and hours of reported deleted scenes, but it makes up for it with the doco on the first disc \\"Making A.I\\", directed by prolific documentarian Laurent Bouzerau. Included on disc 2 are a series of featurettes with Spielberg talking about developing the vision of A.I. Industrial Light and Magic group on the film's special effects and Stan Winston explains how the robots were created. There's also a featurette on the sound effects and orchestral score for the film, several theatrical trailers and production design photos.

B00004TRD8|5.0|After the moderate success of The Terminator, James Cameron decided to outdo himself with the old \\"bigger is better\\" modus operandi, and together with the greatest special effects maestros in Hollywood, created one of the most amazing sci fi action thrillers ever! This time around, Schwarzenegger was to be the good guy and fans were less than happy with the idea. The Austrian oak who immortilised himself as the unstoppable killing machine who spoke the famous line: \\"I'll be back!\\" But movie geeks had little reason to worry, for Cameron had something better up his sleeve, with the T1000, an even more invincible killing machine who could take on Arnie's T100. The tantilising premise and top-notch talent behind the collosal project ensured boffo box office. And once again, Arnie (with shades for added coolness) proved that when it comes to blowing up things with really big guns, there is no substitute.<br />The action set-pieces are some of the most incredible ever put together, and with Stan Winston's lethal creation and ILM's morphing liguid metal guy (a menacing Patrick Stewart) battling it out for the future of mankind, the stakes are high, and the action ante even higher. A seriously buffed-up Linda Hamilton is a much stronger character than in the first film, and her hard-edged persona is well-played and fits the film's \\"come and get it!\\" tone. While the original's tense structure and nerve-shredding pace makes it superior in terms of cracking action, but in terms of spectacle and jaw-dropping SFX, T2 wins hands down. Wether this of the seminal original is the best is debatable, but what is for sure is that it is truly one awesome thrill ride packed with out-of-this world effects that still amaze 11 years later. Will the upcoming Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines be better? Only time will tell, but rest assured, T2 takes it deserved place in the collection of all-time greats and is a must-have on DVD.<br />The extras are really awesome, with a commentary by 26 Members of cast and crew, commentary by director James Cameron, Commentary by Arnold Schwarzenegger, trailers, the 1.85 Widescreen Theatrical Version, or you can choose the 1.85 Widescreen Special Edition Version. Also, there's over 6 hours of content, \\"The Making of T2\\" Featurette, \\"T2: More Than Meets the Eye\\" Featurette, \\"The Making of T2: 3-D: Breaking the Screen Barrier\\" and Supplemental Material - additional features which cover every aspect of the Terminator 2: Judgment Day film making process.

B00006AG5N|5.0|I am not an elvis fan, but I do love music.  I bought the CD for the \\"A little less conversation mix\\" which I had heard on the Nike TV soccer commercial, but the quality of the work they did to the recording of this CD is great, you can´t help feel like dancing, \\"heartbreak hotel\\", \\"don´t be cruel\\", and some many other great songs, with great CD quality. On top of that is a selection of 30 of the greatest songs from the King. But it, you won´t regret it!!
0743424425|5.0|I thought The Shining by Steven King was a excellent novel.  I thought King  wrote really well throughout the book.  If you like novels where it is mostly horror where you are concerned for the people this is a good book for you.  This book also makes you think a lot about the shining and if any of this stuff could really happen.   This novel pushes people's beliefs because a lot in this novel couldn't happen in real life, but while you're reading you think about if any of this could be true ad really happen.  I know most of it, like the hotel wanted to kill Danny and Wendy, could never happen in real life but I think that some people actually have something sort of like the shining.  I really thin that some people can read minds and see things that will happen in the future.  I really enjoyed that part out of the book, just thinking about it.<BR> This novel is not slow.  When the people are sitting there talking it is usually interesting and you want to know what they are talking about.  While there is also a a lot of action in this novel.  Well, of course there has to be action, the man tries to kill his wife and kid but there is action besides that.  <BR> Throughout the book, it kept my interest, especially the end.  When I got to the last 250 pages I read it all in one day, on account I couldn't put it down, I just had to know what was going to happen.  It was pretty scary to, jack was chasing Danny and Wendy around the house and Danny was having images of bad stuff and it was really good.  I was concerned for Wendy and Danny because they were so close to death so many times and I had no idea what was going to happen.<BR> I know a lot of the people out there reading his want to red this book because of the movie, this book is much better hen the movie.The book has a better ending, has more exciting things happen in it, and doesn't have any of those slow scenes where it shows the area that they are in for five minutes.  The book also developed the character's more, in the movie I didn't think at all that Jack had a little of the shining. In the novel \\"His nostrils flared a little...soap?\\" Jack thought when he went           in the bathroom of 217 after his son had been strangled in that same area.  Jack also noticed the plant animals moving toward him, ready to kill him ,\\"When he had come down the path (the dog) had been siting up.....now it was crouched, head tilted, the clipped merge of the mouth seemed to snarl slightly....the lions were closer to the tracks\\". When Danny had noticed they were moving later in the novel it was more intense but still that proves that Jack has a little of the shining.<BR> If you like very slow bring novels, then the shining is not for you.  The shining is fast paced, scary, long (so more happens in the novel), and has very good writing.  This probably isn't for the person that likes slow boring books and the person that only reads novels that are complete believable because with this novel you have to think outside the box.
B00006AW2G|5.0|It becomes apparently clear upon listening to this disc in comparison to the copy I bought nearly 4 years ago (as well as my original vinyl), that some serious time was spent in remastering these recordings. You can actually hear Mick over the bass lines. Keith's guitar licks actually have their own dedicated channel and come through crystal clear. The audible evidence is clear on this disc from track 1, and is well worth the $ spent.
B000000W5P|3.0|After years and years of doing drugs, the Rolling Stones began to burn out.  This is probably the prime example of how the Stones slowly lost their touch.  The best songs are the stuff they play on the radio; 'Shattared', 'Miss You', and 'Beast of Burden'.  The other songs are alright, nothing too special.  There is a really funny songs called 'Far Away Eyes'.  The overall sound doesn't seem to fit; the instruments sound ugly and out of place.
0553296981|4.0|When I first look at this book, my curiosity forces me to have a look at it. I just doubt why a young girl&iexcl;¦s dairy can became a classic .Now I must say what a lucky that Anne&iexcl;¦s dairy can be show to the world.<br />Anne Frank, a 15-year-old Jewish make a sacrifice of the World War 2. She wrote everything about her life in her family-hiding place within two years. I can realize a teenage girl under a severe condition, what she had face was related to her death. It totally reflect what she felt, what she saw and what she anxieties about It seems that She written wrote dairy because she didn&iexcl;¦t believe anyone except Kitty, the person she trustworthy who imagine by herself.<br />  She makes me deeply think about my outlook on life. As I am study science, I have no idea of the Holocaust. It is more touching to understand the real case rather than read the textbook. I please that I am living in a relatively better condition, at least it is unnecessary for me to concern about break out of war. How about the others? Wars still exist in the world. There is so many people suffer the problem like Anne or even serious.<br />I believed Anne was a brave and mature youngster. For her age, she already had critical thinking. The style of Anne to write diary was quite different. She treats Kitty as a confident. After I read the whole book, I ask myself what is the purpose of written diary, Is that I can&iexcl;¦t confide to people around me? And you?It's a pity if diary act as this role.<br />I admired Anne&iexcl;¦s father, Otto Frank, can tidy up her diary after the whole family was kill and he could pluck up his courage to face the remaining life.<br /> I high recommend this book to all of you, especially if you love to write dairy.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Listen, obviously people who denegrates this album are not rnb, hiphop, nor soul listener, complaining about Lauryn's lyrics and her rap.  Please, before you criticize about this album, have some background about these music categories, and unless you love these categories, don't even dare to write a single thing about this album. <BR>Now about the album, this album is without any doubt one of the best, if not the best.  What makes this album so great is the way Lauryn chose her usage of her chorus.  Her chorus which is all her own voice, is like nothing heard before.  This unique album has no downfall.  Sure, some songs like Final Hour, and Super Star might sound a little bit monotonous, however her lyrics substitutes some of her flaws.  To Zion, Nothing Even Matters, and The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill are so affectionate that they touch me every single time I listen to them.  <BR>With her emotions and her talent, this album is worth more than its 14 dollars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a fantastic addition to the excellent moving filmed in the same genre: Saving PVT Ryan.  In fact, it's almost like a series built out of that movie.  I am also a huge fan of Steven Ambrose, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg - having all three of those together, with a hand into this series, has really added a first class touch to this mini-series.<BR>Steven Ambrose has a remarkable way of telling the \\"big story\\" of history through personal events of several people directly involved in the historical event.  Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg's close relationship and dedication to quality filmmaking, historical accuracy clearly brings Steven Ambrose's written word to life.  <BR>Finally, while there are some \\"bigger-name\\" actors in this, they do not dominate the series so you get a sense that the movie is not \\"Actor-dependant\\" but story dependent.  <BR>As an amateur military historian - (WWI-II European Theater of Operations) and a former Army Officer, I strongly recommend this series to anyone interested in learning about the dynamics of small units before, during and after combat.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I cannot tell you how many times I quote this film and find myself the only one laughing hysterically. It is pure genius, original and entertaining plot, humorous to adults and kids alike, fantastic original soundtrack, stupendous voice talent, brilliant animation and best of all, the most cute little girl EVER! If you haven't seen this movie, buy it, I can guarantee you will love it no matter how old you are. Also, I think I may be the only person who thinks that George is just the cutest Scarer out there!
B00002R0MC|5.0|This collection is great for bob marley fans, new and old.<BR>it has great music, and some unreleased material. <BR>the only problem I have is that it's [alot of money], and I don't like spending that kind of money on 4 cd's and a book. <BR>but I saved up my money.<br />If you have all of his albums already, then I wouldnt buy it<BR>unless your a fanatic.<br />MCL                      <BR>                                    <jo out>
B00005JKLZ|3.0|The makers of this film saw fit to re-write H.G. Wells classic.  Wells was a genius.  The rewrite man was a \\"hack\\".  Apparently significant changes were made to fit the graphic desigh of the wotld of the future.  In doing so the original plot was rendered mindless.  If you have never read the book or seen the last \\"Time Machine\\" you might possibly like this one, even with the nagging sense of \\"this does not make sense\\".<BR>Or buy this one then treat yourself to the good version from the 1950s or thereabouts.
0517548232|5.0|Economics can be a rather intimidating area of study, but this is partly because many of us have not been educated to look too far beyond immediate effects of our actions. Hazlitt repeatedly illustrates, in clear and understandable language, why economic agendas which focus on beneficiaries only soon cause more harm than good. Here Hazlitt discusses an array of topics from tariffs, minimum wage, &quot;full employment,&quot; the effects of machinery on employment, government price fixing, rent control, and others.<br />&quot;Economics in One Lesson&quot; has been revised over many years and was originally written over 50 years ago, but amazingly, the very topics he discusses can be found regularly on the nightly news, in newspapers, or discussed among politicians. Hazlitt believes that although economists are largly in agreement with what the government and unions should and should not do, he feels that we've learned very little. Fortunately, Hazlitt has left us a concise book that explains how we can really benefit society in a sound economic way. Recommended!
B000000H5K|5.0|Scanning through the reviews of this album a person would think that some music fans want Sepultura to don mullets and tight jeans again and continue &quot;thrash&quot;ing. ROOTS is a very dynamic, exciting album. This band has always impressed me with their respect for and understanding of world cultures and music. Thrash is a dead art form. Sepultura (and now Soulfly) are quite alive. They have remained relevant. A rare feat indeed. I tossed out my Metallica albums a long time ago. Sepultura is the only metal band left in my collection.
B00005QIPH|5.0|There's been alot of hype on this CD, and some people were let down on it. But i thought it was great. TIP: Don't expect alot from the CD, it's fun Indie-rock. If you want rock, you will be pleased, others beware. It's not an experimental album with odd sounds of wonder and beauty.
B000002NJS|1.0|techno [poo] with pretensious lyrics. Don't get me wrong, I am a big Madonna fan, but this material just failed to live up to all the hype(and my personal expectations).I've really tried liking this cd,but after about a million listens,I just fail to see all the emotional depth,or perfect musical quality that everyone thinks this cd is full of. I just find it shallow, and just as bad with the like a virgin and material girl [poo] she started out with. Maybe it's just the fact that I SERIOUSLY dislike techno music, but that's not even the point. The melodies are totally dull,definately stuff we've heard before.the lyrics are childish and completely pretencious. I recommend all the rest of madonna's work(besides this, and of course the material girl,like a virgin [poop])
B00005QATY|5.0|I don't think I've ever been so quick to buy a movie--certainly not to watch one as many time as I already have this one--and it only gets funnier .     Everyone I know is singing the songs, from my 92 year old mother to my 3 year old granddaughter. It might actually revive the art of 3-part harmony.     Everyone in it looks like he's having the time of his life. I can't look at Tim Blake Nelson w/o laughing, & his singing voice is beguiling. George Clooney is PERFECT, Charles Durning is stupendous, Holly Hunter is--as always-- marvelous, and I think the guy who plays the blind manager of WEZY & that unforgettable woman in the bank who whispers, \\"That's Baby Face Nelson\\", deserve a new category of Oscars: \\"Best One-Minute-or-Less Performance\\".     I love the women's shapeless feedsack dresses & faces w/o makeup. I love the baptismal procession to \\"Down in the River to Pray\\" (best song in the movie, though that's a close one). I love the crazy mixed-up chronology w/Pappy O'Daniel (beloved former governor of Texas) & his Lightcrust Doughboys metamorphosed into governor of Mississippi & his Farina band. I love the three cons' \\"deus ex machina\\" escapes from pursuers, I love the many insightful commentaries on human nature like Clooney's shortlived religiosity.     No one writes comedy dialogue like the Coens. This is a quirky masterpiece of good clean intelligent fun, & that's always been the rarest commodity in the world. My eyes cross when I read the handful of negative reviews of this pure delight of a movie. Who ARE these people?
B00005JKCH|5.0|This movie was 150% excellente! ... I loved it so much! Tobey McGuire does a good job at playing Spider Man and Kirsten Dunst is an EXCELLENT Mary Jane (MJ). I was kind of ... at the end because I thought it ended a little too soon and they should have put an extra 10 minutes into it AT LEAST. ... Everyone who HASN'T seen this, NEEDS to! Especially a Spider Man comic reader, this movie follows the comic entirely and well!
B00005JKJA|4.0|I won't go into a review of the content of the film; perhaps another time for that.<BR>What I will comment on is the absence of chapters in the DVD!  A 2 1/2 hour film and no chapters!<BR>Here's the kind of problems that creates.<BR>I bought a used copy and it was a bit smudged on the shiny side.  About an hour and ten minutes into the film, the smudge part is hit and the skipping starts.<BR>OK, out comes the DVD, the surface is given a once over with a tissue and back into the player.<BR>Now what?  Five minutes of fast forwarding is what.<BR>A while later, something comes up for me two hours into the film and I have to take it out.<BR>Returned later, popped the DVD into the player and now an even longer wait for fast forward to do its magic.<BR>Hey David Lynch! Whose dopey idea was it to exclude chapters?  Yours, the production companies?<BR>Real bad idea.
6302799066|5.0|Probably the greatest anti-war movie spoof ever made. Yet, it sends a message about the insanity of war.<br /> Peter Sellers plays Dr. Strangelove, a mad German nuclear scientist and two other roles. A crazy commander orders a nuclear air strike on Russia and the President and others must try to stop it. After talking to a drunk Russian Premier, the President learns the Russians have recently created a \\"doomsday\\" machine. \\"Dirty\\" nuclear bombs will automatically explode if Russia is attacked. If U.S. planes are not stopped, everyone of earth will die. One SAC commander (Slim Pickens) is determined to get through to his Russian target. Out of touch with U.S. communications due to a nearby missle explosion on his plane, he manages to release a nuclear bomb by riding it down through the bombay doors to its destination.<br />  This movie is great fun! It should be mandatory watching for all generations.
B00006IX0R|5.0|In my opinion they are simply the best band out there.  I own all of their regular CD's and The Treasure Box AND the Live in Paris 1999 DVD (version 2) AND now I own the imported limited edition Stars CD.  I would reccomend them to anyone who enjoys good easy-to-listen-to rock.<br />Bottom line:  Be careful, extremely addictive music.
B000002MJC|4.0|The name of this CD (&quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;) is appropriate considering how many songs on here contain religious/spiritual themes and have pretty obvious titles like &quot;Judas&quot; and lyrics like &quot;The narrowest path / Is always the holiest&quot; (from &quot;Judas&quot;) and &quot;Friends, if you've lost your way / You will find it again some day&quot; (from &quot;Get Right With Me&quot;). There are a few fast songs on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; (like the first track, &quot;I Feel You&quot;, that begins with a cavity-piercing noise similar to screeching tires, and the fast-beating &quot;Rush&quot;, where, at one point, David Gahan sounds a lot like Robert Smith from the Cure), but the majority of them are relatively slow and fall away from DM's typical synth sound by featuring more mellower instruments (strings/cello) like in &quot;One Caress&quot;, or are as simple as just including hand claps and humming like in &quot;Condemnation&quot;. A couple songs I had to listen to repeatedly, though, to really enjoy them (i.e., &quot;Condemnation&quot; and &quot;Higher Love&quot;), but this CD has some of my favorite songs by Depeche Mode (such as &quot;Mercy in You&quot;, &quot;In Your Room&quot;, &quot;Rush&quot;, and &quot;One Caress&quot;). I wouldn't consider &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; my favorite Depeche Mode CD, but I'd still recommend it to DM fans.
0800177177|2.0|While the story does follow the major events of Stoker's novel, it has been rewritten to the point that it is almost unrecognizable. I will admit that visually this film is impressive. The scenery and cinematography are quite good. As for the cast, Anthony Hopkins is a very enjoyable van Helsing, and Gary Oldman does very well as Count Dracula- but not Bram Stoker's vision of the vampire. The other performances are forgettable.
B00004RIV4|4.0|Moloko are one of the most original and experimental dance acts out there and this is, no doubt, very evident on this landmark album.  Roisin Murphy's voice is breathtaking, full of emotion, and texture which makes her one of pop's and dance music's most interesting personalities.  Many of the songs here are difficult at first, but work very well as an entire album.  &quot;Things To Make and Do&quot; is definately for more creative listeners, so if pop and pop only is your kind of bag, then this probably won't go over too well with you.  &quot;The Time is Now&quot; is the standout track here, which, in my opinion, is one of the best dance records composed in the last decade (Mixmag magazine readers agree).  What's even better is that this CD is full of lyrical depth as well, which is a rare thing for dance records, but let's not forget that dance is only part of what is Moloko.  The inclusion of club favorite &quot;Sing It Back&quot; is a definite plus.  I can't wait 'till the next album.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Start with one of the most riveting moments in American history. Use as a guide one of the greatest treatments of that story- namely Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;- and so much so that the script very nearly word for word was taken from the book. Add the fantastic acting abilities of such men as Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Sam Elliot. Throw in for good measure several thousand Living Historians, also known as Re-enactors, who live and breathe the War Between the States. Film it all on the actual battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. <BR>  Given all of the above, this movie HAD to be a classic, in the company of such movies as All Quiet On The Western Front, Tora Tora Tora, or Zulu. It is intensely gripping- even though you know that Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia will be defeated and turned back, even though you know that Pickett's Charge will be smashed and repulsed, you are unable to tear yourself away from this film for even a moment.<BR>  Historical accuracy was the watchword when making this film. Uniforms, weapons, hairstyles and beards, manners of speech- everything was made to be as authentic as possible. The result is a film that will not only show you the Battle of Gettysburg, it will take you there.<BR>  The performances of the cast are superb. Martin Sheen as the religious, resigned, and gentle Robert E. Lee; Tom Berenger as the serious Longstreet, Lee's right hand man who senses doom but can not prevent it; Sam Elliot as General Buford, who fights his dismounted cavalry troops as infantry to slow the advancing Confederates and give the Federal Army time to arrive; and Jeff Daniels, who is unforgettable as Colonel Chamberlain, whose desperate defense of Little Round Top against overwhelming odds and relentless Rebel attacks saved the Federal Army's left flank and the Battle.<BR>  The cinematography is outstanding, and the re-enactments of the different phases of the Battle are well directed and carriedout. There is absolutely not one flaw in any facet of this film, unless you happen to be from below the Mason-Dixon Line and don't enjoy the outcome of the Battle! I myself am a born Yankee....
0060987464|5.0|ok here i go.... i think EVERYONE should read this book!! that includes the people that LOVE Manson, the people that HATE Manson and people that just became a sheep of his flock.  <br />first off- it's written by the Big Cheese, manson himself.  he talks about everything, school being hell, his grandfather's pornography, how he broke down several different times, struggles with girls, drug hallucinations, and Anton LaVey.  ALSO, at the back includes exerpts from his Journal, some rumours about him, claims, protests against him by Xtians, pictures... you name it, this book's got it! <br />It's packed with everything that you want to know up to the release of Antichrist Svperstar.  i am anticipating an update of this biography soon... it is definately one of the best books i've read in my entire lyfetime... he writes so well.. and he's not afraid to be himself. quite intelligent, witty, sarcastic, down to mellow and vulnerable.  <br />LOVE IT!!!!
B00006J3WH|5.0|Everyone involved in Once More With Feeling - from Joss to Christophe, from Jesse to Marti, from every mainstay and guest star to each extra or backup dancer - is to be thanked and praised.  A musical episode is a huge undertaking and it was pulled off brilliantly.<br />Once More, With Feeling was a true musical. Sometimes, folks burst into song for no reason; other times, it was just the right time and place. It offered funny tunes (The Parking Ticket), a jazzy duet (I'll Never Tell), showstopping ballads (Under Your Spell, Standing), the group numbers and more. The hour was replete not just with songs but with emotion. It moved the stories, the people and the plots forward. This episode shook up almost every friendship and relationship and altered the course of the season.  Secrets were revealed, hearts were broken, lives were changed.<br />Much like I pay heavy attention to the writing in a regular episode - the dialogue, the snappy our-show-only lingo to which we've grown fond, grown accustomed - here, I listened closely to the lyrics. I wasn't expecting everyone to sound perfectly.  I was watching their acting and listening to the words.  Not everyone wanted to sing, but they did. They were brave enough to do it. What I say to the naysayers who are telling me so-and-so sang poorly is this: Were you up there, on that screen, bearing your heart for the world to see? Just standing up there on stage - or in this case, in front of a camera - takes guts.<br /><br />What an absolute pleasure it is to have the entire cast actually sing and take part in the episode rather than lipsynch to other people's voices. Granted, some shy away from singing, so Joss had them only sing a few lines by themselves and otherwise take part in the group chorus. Everyone took part; everyone was passable...<br />Some were outright outstanding. Amber Benson (Tara) stole the screen with \\"Under Your Spell,\\" a lyrical, magical love ballad. Our hearts broke right along with her later on the reprise, and with Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) as he proclaims himself a hinderance to Buffy in \\"Standing.\\" When you couple the two voices for their duet, not only do you get the mirroring of stories, but lovely harmonies. Tony and Amber deserve standing ovations. Nicholas Brendon and Emma Caulfield, as Xander and Anya, made me laugh out loud with \\"I'll Never Tell,\\" the perfect piece for the two lively actors who possess such great comic timing. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) impressed me quite a bit. From the Disney-esque inquisitive \\"Going Through the Motions\\" to the emotional \\"Life's A Show,\\" that girl gave it her all.<br />One cannot remark upon this music and not mention Christophe Beck. This amazing composer worked on the series full time for years, then departed to focus on scoring films, but returned to provide instrumental pieces and the overture for Once More, With Feeling. The bonus tracks also give us score pieces from famous episodes \\"Hush,\\" \\"Restless\\" and \\"The Gift,\\" also scored by Beck and instantly recognizable by any fan.<br />With an immediately-addicting hour packed with harmony, revelations and shakeups, this episode was rightly named: \\"Once More, With Feeling.\\"ise, and with Anthony Stewart Head (Giles) as he proclaims himself a hinderance to Buffy in \\"Standing.\\" When you couple the two voices for their duet, not only do you get the mirroring of stories, but lovely harmonies.

0446608955|5.0|This is my favorite book. I dont cry a lot, but wow, did i shed tears after reading this. I loved it soo much that i bought the movie and the soundtrack! All three are a grerat gift. Ive  read the book 3 times.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I came into the movie with high expectations. There was a good story-line, and some slightly-above actors to back it up. Toss in a (usually) great director, and you should get a half-decent movie. This is NOT the case.<br />Five minutes I found myself laughing hysterically at the shocking acting, and didn't stop until the credits started to roll. Ever see those B-grade action movies where the hero, impervious to bullets, mows down battalions of enemies with his trusty pistol?? This is much the same case as in Windtalkers.<br />Utilizing every war movie cliche known to man and shocking and thoroughly unbelievable acting, this is possibly the worst WWII movie in film history.<br />What could have been an interesting story (with the Navajo codetalkers) was barely touched on... we see the code being put to use hardly at all, and in moments when they could have more easily just used plain English (like when giving a battleship coordinates of a Japanese gun battery).<br />All in all, I would not reccomend this movie to buy. By all means, rent it for a night of comedic genius, but if you're looking for a good WWII movie, look elsewhere.
B000009QOC|5.0|While DANZIG introduced us to Glenn Danzig after Samhain and The Misfits, LUCIFUGE really takes flight with some excellent material, improving swiftly upon the blues-metal formula of the debut and turning in some impressive numbers on this album.<br />\\"Snakes of Christ\\" and \\"Her Black Wings\\" are full-throttle rockers, the latter ranking among some his absolute best work. \\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" and \\"777\\" also rock with some excellent guitar work in the latter from John Christ. But what's real surprising is that Danzig can get real tender and yet still rock, as showcased on the beautiful ballad \\"Blood & Tears\\" and the semi-ballad flare \\"Devils Plaything\\". Another nice surprise has to be the Delta-blues feel of \\"I'm The One\\", with its jangly acoustic guitar and Danzig's great vocals. Also of interest on this album is the bluesy grim of \\"Pain In The World\\" and the blues-bent rocker \\"Killer Wolf\\". <br />While Danzig would continue to delve even further with future releases, LUCIFUGE began the impressive musical growth that Danzig and cohorts experienced on this highly impressive and downright irresistible sophomore effort.
B00003W8NM|5.0|The title of this movie divides people into two groups: the people who believe that there is nothing to the script other than a group of idiots beating the ... (literally) out of each other, and those people who actually took the time to discover that the previous assumption is totally false.  A friend told me I absolutely HAD to see this movie, so I rented it.  Not paying attention to the first 20 minutes, imagine my surpise to suddenly be stricken completly confused by what I was hearing.  I immediately rewound it and began it again, giving it the attention it deserved.  After it was over, I rewound it again and watched it.  It was perhaps the 5th or 6th viewing that I finally took everything in.  Not to say that I didn't comprehend it; the plot is quite understandable.  But it is unbelievable how many subtle points indicate everything that is to come.  Similar to the opening of \\"The Sixth Sense\\": pay proper attention, and the solution is easily predictable.  However, \\"Fight Club\\" has not much to do with a group of men getting together and venting frustrations by bare-knuckle fighting (with draws connections to Brad Pitt's role in \\"Snatch\\").  The fighting is only incedential.  It serves simply as a method of finding people who meet certain characteristics to perform certain activities.  Almost everything about the movie makes you wince: from the fighting itself, to the camera work beautifully expressing the disgusting conditions surrounding the characters, to the final scene during which you sit there in amazement and total awe.  It's at the same time hard to believe and completely understandable.  There is no other way everything would have happened, and yet you sit there in a stupor because you are still upset at yourself for believing the same thing I did.  I happen to only be 17 years of age at the time I'm writing this review, and I have not seen as many movies, obviously, as the people who wrote the published, professional reviews of this movie, but my hat off to the director, producer, actors, screenwriters, and scriptwriters involved in the making of this movie, along with the open-minded people who actually took the time to absorb this movie for what it is: a perfect piece of cinema that forces you to realize that these things are not only possible, but they do happen. In fact, a friend of mine recently moved from Wisconsin told me that there was an attempt in his town to ban this movie because people were reinacting many of the characters' activities.  Similar in fact to the reaction in England of Kubrick's \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\"  And how many people are still talking about that movie?
B000068G9X|5.0|Although this might not rank as every Danzig fan's favorite release, this really is where Danzig started. This bluesy-metallic rock disc began Danzig's journey without the Misfits, 14 years (and still going under Danzig) album career. \\"Twist of Cain\\" was one of the best tracks on this self-titled disc, but \\"Mother\\" was the real innovation...the track that really caught the eye of most Danzig fans out there. <br />DANZIG also contains such veritable treats as \\"She Rides\\", the nice thumping bluesy feel of \\"Evil Thing\\", and also \\"Am I Demon\\" which was one of three videos culled from this album.<br />So while this might not be the best Danzig album, it certainly has its fair share of pure rocking moments. It's essential to any Danzig fan's catalog. This is where it all started.
B000001ED1|4.0|Joan Osborne has a great voice and uses that voice to express her emotions perfectly. This album is a great mix of blues, folk, and rock elements. Everyone has heard &quot;One Of Us&quot; (What if God was one of us?), but other highights are St. Theresa, Ladder, and Pensacola. A couple songs, &quot;Let's just Get Naked&quot;, in particular, could have been left out. So overall, I give it 4 stars. She really has talent to express emotion in her music.
B00006AG5N|5.0|\\"Elvis 30 #1 Hits\\", for more or less, delivers what it promises.  These are all of Elvis's number one songs in the USA and UK.  It admits that how what qualifies as a number 1 (not necessarily the Billboard number 1) is not traditional but at least it explains its method unlike other greatest hits CDs.  This collection is high class right down to its extensive liner notes to the remastering that doesn't butcher these classics.  The album is in chronological order and this doesn't make the early tracks sound dated (like on other sets which do this).  These songs are truly so original and fresh (even though they have been played millions times and in every possible place) that being placed in order doesn't make even the earliest tracks sound ancient.  It's either the remastering or the sheer fact that these songs are just that remarkably excellent.      <br />His earliest massive hit was \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", about a depressed youth mourning the loss of his girl.  This is a surprising rock track that still has entertaining sway to it yet is shows the rebellion the kids have, making a rock song about such a depressing subject yet making it a hit.  You knew something was in the air.  \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" and \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" are the most inspired and still well known rock classics that helped change the face of music.  These songs are some of the key classics in his arsenal.  They all feature a signature sound of rough yet sweet vocals and erratically on point rock instrumentation.  It's really hard to describe these songs since they are the primers for rock and roll.  The remastering process makes these singles sound as good as ever.  Although Elvis is the kind of rock, this collection shows his huge diversity well.  \\"Wooden Heart\\", which is probably not known to novice US fans like myself, is partly a German children's sing along song.  You can hear the Italian ballads that inspired \\"It's Now Or Never\\" and \\"Surrender\\".  More tracks showcasing the different aspects of the kings voice include romantic rock song \\"One Night With You\\" and fast paced blues based \\"Hard Headed Woman\\".  And country dominates tracks like the soft \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\\".  The fast paced pop of \\"Devil In Disguise\\" and Motownish \\"Return To Sender\\" proved that Elvis could crank out quality hits in the Beatles era that rival their diversity.  The songs leading up to and including the seventies are my personal favorites.  From the heartfelt epic ballad \\"In The Ghetto\\" to the country-fried groove of \\"Burning Love\\", Elvis's period when the hits came less fast and furious was full of substantial hits.  \\"Cryin' In the Chapel\\" is almost sacred. \\"Suspicious Minds\\", a dour relationship song about an untrusting man and woman, sounds so poppy that you can hear the influence this song had on modern dance music with its soul singing and melody packed guitar. <br />Cheers to RCA for releasing a thrilling package of the biggest and brightest hits from the career of the King of Rock.  The funny thing is that the ended up waiting so long that Elvis eventually had a another hit song, a remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation\\".  The great thing about this slightly speed up mix of the short but sweet original is that it being added as an extra track (due to being a number 1 single in the UK) doesn't affect the classics.  This might be a very biased review since I'm an Elvis person and not a Beatles person, but this album is truly one of the best ever created.  All the tracks blend so well together that you can listen to this massive collection (31 tracks and 80 minutes long) back to front and be entertained the whole time through.  This is one album that everyone should have in their collection (and if you get around to it, maybe pick up the \\"Beatles 1\\").
B0000029LG|5.0|Okay, I'm not gonna waste time on Disc 1 because it's a collection of hits and favorites that any Michael Fan is well enough familiar with.  So let's just skip right to Disc Two.<br />Scream-Truly the most Dance Oriented song on the album, but a rare occasion in which we get Brother to Sister love, and anger, both shouting about injustice.  A Great song, a great video.  And great beginning.<br />They Don't Care About Us-A powerful song really.  Great beat, Some later versions are censored because of some alleged \\"anti-semetic\\" lyrics.  Put it doesn't hurt the song.  Michael's anger somewhat begins here.  Another great video.<br />Stranger in Moscow-A beautiful ballad.  By far one of Michael's best.  Haunting to the Extreme with a chorus that could bring a tear to your eye.  \\"How does it feel when you're alone and it's cold inside?\\"  A beautiful music video.<br />This Time Around-I like this song.  Has a good beat to it.  A tad self-indulgent, but I'd say he's earned it.  Great Rap bridge by the Notorius B.I.G.<br />Earth Song-One of his most powerful ballads to date.  Most of us have seen the video, so we know Michael is true to his subject matter.  Michael hits it hard on this song, worthy of buying the album just for this one.<br />D.S.-Who is Dom Sheldom?  And why is Michael so angry at him?  This isn't a bad song, but it's the one I listen to the least.  <br />Money-Powerful lyrics.  Although Michael doesn't sing a whole lot.  More of a spoken word, but good none the less.  Still Michael a bit angry in this one.<br />Come Together-This one is alot of fun really.  Shows his funk-rock side with this cover of the old Beatles song.  Truly verges on remaking it better than the original.<br />You Are Not Alone-How many awards did this one win?  Too many to count.  This song, written by R. Kelly, shows off the passion he still has for a love ballad.  Very artistic video with his ex-wife Lisa Marie-Presley.<br />Childhood-Some may call this song sappy, not me, it's beautiful.  In our own ways I think most all of us could relate to this song.  Poetic lyrics, well orchestrated instrumentals, and the video has a quite an interesting original concept to it.<br />Tabloid Junkie-A song with a strong message more people need to pay attention to.  Not to mention having to do with Michael's more recent past at that time being a victim of the Tabloid Junkies.  <br />2 Bad-This song has a cool beat, and it's a good dance song.  The only part I don't really enjoy is Shaq rapping in the middle.  Who the hell ever said that Shaq could rap?  He couldn't wrap cheese in a taco!!  At least the parts with Michael are cool.<br />HIStory-More of an anthem than a song.  But amazing none the less.  Using quotes and recorded speeches from pinical moments in History.  Proving Michael respects many people, and is inspired by greatness, causing him greatness as well.  <br />Little Susie-If he ever decides to stop being a pop singer, this song shows proof he could compose music for movies and seriously win OSCARS for it.  It's sad, haunting, beautiful.  A great direction for Michael.<br />Smile-I can't think of a better way to end this record.  This track, which is a tribute and dedication to one of Michael's heroes, Charlie Chaplin.  You can't help but smile I think when you listen to this track, because it's so beautiful, and Michael whistling at the end gives off the most lovely example of Michael's playful side.  <br />A wonderful CD, truly worthy of all good credit.  His most mature and artistic album to date.  Get one for yourself, you won't regret it.
0140067477|4.0|As someone who has always loved Winnie the Pooh, and who has a deep interest in Eastern philosophy, this book was one I'd looked forward to reading. It didn't disappoint. I loved the technique he used of having the characters ask him questions. It was fun, and it kept me engaged in the book  The author explained Taoism in a way that was charming, easy to understand, and not at all dry, as some philosophical works can be. I feel that I have a better understanding of Taoism, and I am now eager to read more about it. What's interesting is that I have a four year old niece who loves Winnie the Pooh, and when we watch the cartoon together, I also now have new, grown-up insight into it, which makes it more fun for me too! <br />The book is quick - in fact, I found it a bit too short - and easy to read. I admit, it could've been a bit more in-depth. I'm sure critics who say this is a very superficial examination of Taoism are probably right. However, I don't know that this criticism is particularly important. I think Hoffman's purpose was simply to whet the reader's appetite so that they'd be motivated to do more study of Taoist philosophy. If I'm correct in this belief, he was successful, at least in my case.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I have wanted to see this flick since I had heard of it in Japan. I have always been a big fan of Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, since I've seen Totoro, KiKi, Princess Mononoke, etc. The story is also very good to this movie and revolves around a bathhouse, I won't spoil too much though! I also did like the music that went to it, it was so addicting, and all the cute little things that Hayao Miyazaki added in! Overall I suggest if you like ani.me you should see this!
0738206679|5.0|This is not a technical book, it is not meant to give a complete overview of current research on networks, and there are very few equations in it.<br />YET, it is a beautifully written book. It is a great chance to experience the joy and excitement of people who recently made some discoveries about networks. It has lots of stories, but the author is very careful and capable in making his technical points clear (just, by using words!).<br />Finally, I want to say that the author indeed accomplishes his objective: This book makes the reader think about networks. I wish in every field people could write such fun books, summarizing their research and the state of the art.<br />-- A PhD student in applied math.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Smooth as silk and a joy to listen to.  Just the right voice for these songs.  Got my vote!
B00006AFUR|5.0|This new CD is tremendously original and innovative from start to finish. It has a new and different sound that will keep you interested and entertained. Jared Leto (the lead singer) has a beautiful, melodic, even mesmerizing voice that captures you. I loved all the songs, but my personal favorites were Capricorn (a strange spacey sound with meaningful lyrics, \\"so I run and hide and tear myself and start again with a new name and eyes that see into infinity\\") Next, I enjoyed \\"Buddha For Mary\\". It's a combination of electrifying sounds and robotic voices (you must hear to know what I mean!!) It also has a driving sound that will make you fervent to listen.  The lyrics will enthrall you. The rest of the album is just as high quality and attention grabbing. You will be amazed at the immense talent of the guys of 30 seconds to Mars. Be sure to get the CD if you don't have it already!!!<BR>Thanks, <BR>-joyce-
B00000099Y|5.0|If you are tired of trendy bands like Linkin Park, Disturbed, Creed or Staind then Tool is a band that you need to check out. I got into Tool because I was tired of all the trendy music that is so prevalent today. It still seems like so many bands are tying to emulate the Seattle sound or they are foolishly following the silly trend of Rap/Rock. Thankfully, there are bands like Tool that do not follow trends. Rather, they are innovators and true artists who are willing to push the creative threshold of music.<br />I also have Undertow and Lateralus and I must say that this is their best album. This was the first album where the band started to enter their experimental/progressive phase of their career.  I like the way a lot of their songs are up to 8 minutes in length.  If you have a short attention span and can't get into long songs then don't but this CD. Tool has shown that they are a band with depth and versatility. <br />Two tracks you have to check out are Aenema and Third Eye. The musical arrangement and emotion on track 13(Aenema) is incredible and one of THE BEST rock songs I have ever heard.  Just listen to all the changes Danny Carey makes in the song and you'll see what I mean. The song is about everything Maynard hates about LA and how he wants it to sink into the Pacific Ocean. \\"Don't just call me a pessimist, try and read between the lines\\" is one quote from the song. <br />Third Eye is also an incredible number and showcases the bands ability to write long songs without boring you. The song begins with an excerpt from a late comedian that the band admired telling a joke about how drugs have brought us some of the greatest music.  Some have said that Lateralus is a better album but I just don't agree.  Aenima has such raw emotion and so many great songs that there is no way that is inferior to Lateralus. I don't think Tool is for everybody but if you want more than just your average mainstream hard rock then you won't be disappointed.

0780021150|4.0|Fritz Lang's masterpiece &quot;M&quot; is clearly one of the greatest of the early sound features made by him or practically anyone else. Peter Lorre gives his greatest performance as a weasly serial killer of little girls, and we accompany him on a couple of his stalkings, the last of which have him marked by the underworld with the letter 'M' and sought out by the city's criminal element, so the police will take some of the heat off them. The sound is crude, obviously added post filming in many instances, but it doesn't reduce the power of one of the greatest of German imports.<br />A film this old (1931) is naturally not going to be in spotless condition, but I have to say that I was very disappointed with Criterion's unusually sloppy work on this film. Clearly little effort was put into making the print pristine with scratches, dirt, and missing frames all still marring the viewing experience (compare what Criterion did with THE LADY VANISHES or THE SCARLET EMPRESS which look practically brand new), and the white bar which crisscrosses the screen (similar to the problem with new prints of THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI) is very annoying. I have seen film prints of &quot;M&quot; without this white bar. I can't understand why it couldn't have been digitally removed. <br />So, one star gets removed due to the nature of the disappointing transfer. The film should nevertheless not be missed!

0375823360|5.0|If you want a review on the content of these books, don't look here. You can find reviews on the content of this series all over the place if you look else where on this site. <br />I just want to say that this is a nice edition of the His Dark Materials series (there is no way to make that sound anymore awkward).  I really like the thickness of these books.  The pages are nice and sturdy, and I really like the illustrations by philip Pullman that head each chapter.
B00005LB50|4.0|Just wanted to point something out that's been mentioned in other reviews -- the reason for songs included on 1,2 &amp; 3 turning up a second time on 4 is because those are the stereo cuts. The first half of disc 4 is the far superior mono version of the debut album that Stills and Young cut.  Listen to the difference and you'll notice it.  All in all this'll due until the Archives are FINALLY released.
0316666343|4.0|I liked this book and recommended it to several friends. In fact, my own copy is drifting about somewhere at this very moment. What an original story. I found it to be a unique point of view, seeing the lives of those left behind from the perspective of the murdered girl, looking down from her version heaven. I also thought the author's idea of heaven was curious. She has a different idea of what heaven should be, rather than the typical heaven used in most stories. The way that heaven is depicted in various genres is as one large heaven for everyone. In &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; each person has their own idea of heaven and those persons who somehow touch their lives in a meaningful way are included in that person's heaven. I liked that idea. It didn't have the ending that I expected. I wouldn't say that I was disappointed at the ending. It was just different. I did come to terms with the ending after a bit of reflection.<BR>All in all, it made me think, it was an easy read, and it kept my attention. &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; was an enjoyable book.
B00005ASQ1|1.0|If you want to see a good movie that is very similar to this one, see Good Will Hunting. It is along the same lines, only about 100 times better. <BR>On to this dreck. This movie was awful. Every movie needs a story. Guess what? This one doesn't. It's 130 minutes of the black guy talking to a pissy Sean Connery, who, by the way should retire because he hasn't been in a good movie since The Rock and wasn't in anything good before that, with the acception of the Bond films. I don't understand the average rating of 4/5 stars on this one-it should be one at the most.<BR>So if you have sleep apnea and have trouble sleeping, just put in Finding Forrester-it is gaurunteed you will be knocked out within 20 minutes. <BR>And don't be worried about missing a big plot development because THERE AREN'T ANY.<BR>So if you want a good, heart-fealt, smart, well-written/acted/directed, try Good Will Hunting over this.
0316666343|4.0|I liked this book and recommended it to several friends. In fact, my own copy is drifting about somewhere at this very moment. What an original story. I found it to be a unique point of view, seeing the lives of those left behind from the perspective of the murdered girl, looking down from her version heaven. I also thought the author's idea of heaven was curious. She has a different idea of what heaven should be, rather than the typical heaven used in most stories. The way that heaven is depicted in various genres is as one large heaven for everyone. In &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; each person has their own idea of heaven and those persons who somehow touch their lives in a meaningful way are included in that person's heaven. I liked that idea.

B000069HK2|3.0|First of all, I'd like to say that I never thought I would like this band.  I like one genre of music and that's it, I'm never open to anything even slightly different, because I'm sooo passionate about emo, like Blink, NFG, Yellowcard, TSL, bands like that.  But with the Atticus compilation being Mark's company there was no doubt I would buy the Atticus Compilation.  Box of Sharp Objects was one of the only songs I hadn't previously heard.  For the for few listens I repeatedly skipped over it thinking that all that yelling was just not for me.  But after a while I found myself listening to it, and jumping to it in my room.  Most people that like this CD seem to like harder stuff, but you gotta admit it also has catchy punk parts to it as well.  If you like hard stuff, emo, punk, anything like that you might like this CD.  As other people have said, not all the songs are great, but for someone who only likes emo, like me, it's pretty good to catch my attention at all.  Check this band out, they're not bad.
6304578482|5.0|I'm not a fan of movies, normally, but this film just grabbed me and will not let go.  It's probably the only film I've seen more than three times (I think I'm up to seven) and I am not even close to tiring of it.  It's just hilarious with wonderful acting (Lisa Kudrow in her usual air-head role, Mira Sorvina as the serious and sensible Romy, Janeane Garofalo as the surly, cynical Heather Mooney, Julia Campbell as the stuck-up Christy Masters, Vincent Ventresca as the \\"dumb jock\\" Billy Christianson, Alan Cumming as nerd Sandy Frink, etc.).  The cliques of the high school class are so typical and help the viewer really relate to this film.  Whose class didn't have their \\"preppy\\" group, nerd group, jock group, etc.? The early 80s music makes the film even more wonderful; however, the choice of tracks indicates a high school class of '84 rather than of '88. Don't try to analyze this film or search for deeper meaning, just sit back and enjoy again and again.  I only wish there was a sequel:  \\"Romy and Michele Go To College\\"!!  Perfect!!

0316666343|2.0|I'd read so many high-octane reviews of Lovely Bones that I began it with great hope and anticipation.  Unfortunately, I ended it with a whimper.  The engaging premise was ripe fruit left to die on the vine.  The book moved slowly and I never felt a great deal of empathy for the characters, except perhaps the father.  There was too much nuance; too much literary stylishness; too little that touched my heart or challenged my mind.  And I was really turned off by the body-borrowing that went on late in the book.  Not exactly sorry I read it, but ....hmmmm... well, maybe I am.
B000068OSK|5.0|Here is the first effort of the next age in rock, Jack and Meg White push off hard with this effort. You really need to see the progression of greatness in this band, so start here and then go on to De Stijl and Cells and know you are onto something incredible here.<br />One reviewer said \\"White Stripes' is completely unselfconscious-- it's just two kids honestly following their instincts and influences, yet creating an original.\\" He's right, The Stripes don't sound like anybody else (no matter how hard you try to draw parallels). Jack is brilliant live too.....just yelling out in the middle of a song \\"Buddy Holly is dead and there is nothing you and I can do about it!\\" or ranting about an \\"insane Elvis\\" leads you to believe it's all stream-of-thought rantings anyway (and that would include the music).  Legions of other bands will be compared to them, not the other way around.<br />In Jimmy you honestly think Jack's guitar is going to explode......there just isn't any room for bass and rhythm in this sound.....how can one guy sound like System Of A Down, Metallica, or Rush all by himself? Big Three, Bricks.....there is this incredible run of three killer tracks - Wasting My Life/Cannon/Astro that makes you want to scream how good rock and roll can be......honestly, there is way too much sound here for two people.....it's the sound of an original rock lightning strike......it's rare......there hasn't been a band like this one in 10 years.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie is not for people looking for a nice Meg Ryan flick, where the cliche story is so predictable it's pathetic.<BR>For the people who complain about this movie, or say it \\"doesn't make sense\\", well, maybe Monday night football would be more appropriate for you.<BR>Naomi Watts was incredible, as was the soundtrack.  If you are into thought provoking movies, this one is for you.
0446608955|5.0|I teach 8th grade. One of my students suggested that I read this book. I ordered it from ... and started to read it Saturday. I could not put it down on Sunday. You become so engrossed in the lives of Jamie and Landon. The author gives you a hook in the beginning and reels you in through the book. I think it is a wonderful and beautiful book. It is filled with honest feeling and there is a depth to the characters that you do not usually find. Once you discover the secret that Jamie is unwilling to share, the book takes on a deeper meaning. You will cry, but from your tears you will think of others with Jamie's strength. It is an amazing book!
B00005K3O0|4.0|This is for fans of Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen kind of. It's about riencarnation. Pop in the Dvd and watch the theatrical trailer first, then watch the film. A shocking ending. Haven't read the book. Some of the acting is hokey, but it can be forgiven. Rent it!
B00005JLO2|4.0|A detached and thoughtful (even obsessive) study of courage. The first fifteen minutes of the film are shaky and murky, perhaps reflecting the hero's state of mind. There is a dramatic change of pace when his unit ships out to the Sudan. The scenery, the costumes, the action sequences are spectacular. War on horseback is depicted with all its  visual excitement, as well as its horror and suffering, without omitting the story's many ironies. The unsentimental treatment of love, honor, and patriotism may leave viewers unsatisfied, but it is a worthwhile film for adults and adolescents.
B000002P2W|5.0|The Who has a LOT of great albums. This is one of them, and it shows how talented all of them are/were. I was very sad when I heard about Entwilstle's passing, because being a bass player he was a huge influence to my playing. This album is a fine example of his great playing and songwriting, too. He wrote &quot;Sucess story&quot;, one of the best songs here.
B000065V41|4.0|This movie is a true treasure that warms the heart and gladdens the soul. Michael Caine is outstanding and it's his classic portrail that enhances the muppets. It's impossible not to sing along and to continue singing the wonderful music long after the movie is over.<br />I would have given this 10 stars, but the colors seem a bit faded and it's not in wide screen. But don't let that stop you from buying this. It's a real treat.
0312265859|3.0|I have to say, this series is getting stale. Unless Janet Evanovich can invent some new twists to throw in her next books, we might as well just reread the first four books over and over. Nothing new has happened since then, except in each book I wait the entire time for Stephanie to get together with one or the other of her two hot hunks, and keep getting mad when she doesn't manage.<br />I am wondering if Janet doesn't have a formula on her wall somewhere telling her exactly how to write her books: A car must blow up on page ninety, a bail jumper must foil Stephanie on page one twenty, and so on.<br />On the plus side, Stephanie Plum is fun, unflappable, good hearted, and every once in a while she even has a serious moment, when she actually can connect with the reader on a deaper level and make you think about things.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I love this movie. It is positive, upbeat, and just plain fun. You will always feel good after watching it.<br />Instead of being the typical rich, snotty, elitish sorrority queen, Reese Witherspoon' s Elle Woods is warm, endearing, funny (especially when she cries during the breakup scene with Warner; her hilarious crying is reminscent of Doris Day's in \\"Pillow Talk\\"), and intelligent.<br />For once the tables are turned and the popular sorrority girl finds herself an outcast with Harvard's staid law school students and professors. But with pluck, determination, and a positive outlook, Elle forges on and eventually wins them over.<br />The scene where Elle introduces herself to some classmates during Orientation is priceless. After she utters the classic line, \\"Whoever thought orange was the new pink is seriously disturbed,\\" the reaction from her classmates is absolutely hysterical. I laugh everytime I see it.<br />The only REALLY dippy-dumb part was the \\"Bend And Snap\\" portion. That was really LAME, and really did not fit into the film all that well. To me, that temporarily transformed Elle back into the mindless, air-headed blonde.  It just didn't fly.<br />Other than that portion, this is a cute, fun film. The soundtrack is superb--being from Hawaii, I am a fan of Hoku's music. It's nice to see a local girl make good. (For all of you who don't know, Hoku Ho is Don \\"Tiny Bubbles\\" Ho's daughter!)
B00001OH7G|5.0|as far as live albums go this one is one of the finest.<BR> <BR>recorded at concerts in Dublin, in Cork (where he grew up),<BR> and in Belfast - at a time when the violence in northern Ireland was at its worst, rory was one of the few artists who would even consider playing there - a fact which endeared him greatly to his home fans.<BR>the sound leaps from the speakers, demonstrating that he truly was at his best when faced with an adoring crowd. just let the crowd noise play out at the end of \\"whos that coming\\", you can still feel the electricity nearly thirty years later.<BR> <BR>his live recordings are stunning (see also \\"live in Europe\\" and BBC sessions), and are looser than his studio work, with the band locking into a groove rather than faithful renditions of the originals.<BR>\\"as the crow flies\\" is a particular highlight as is \\"too much alcohol\\" with the sound fading in at the begining giving the impression that the bass groove could've been going for hours...<BR>\\"i wonder who\\" is one of those tracks you just have to sit back and have a smoke to. simple as that. great blues music.<br />its rare that i would feel compelled to write a review but this is one of those albums that if the house was burning down i would grab first...............and then maybe one of the kids....<BR>anyway, get it and love it.
0783226160|5.0|If you've only seen this film on television, then you haven't really seen it. Television stations usually gut this film of some of the best gags, dialog, and of course, nudity. Without that stuff, it becomes pointless- like a Mad Magazine parody of National Lampoon.<br /> This version with THX remastering is really sharp and crisp. The original theatrical trailer is shown without it, and the difference is like day and night.<br /> I love this film for the same reason that that I love &quot;Grease&quot;, namely, everyone seems to be having so much more fun getting their third-rate public education than I got getting my third rate public education....
B00006FDCD|5.0|When I saw this movie I was totally drawn in. It was haunting to say the least. Tim Curry plays Pennywise the clown. This is his second best performance( first being Dr.Frank N Furter )in Rocky Horror Picture Show.The rest of the cast are compelling as well.This film, originally a t.v.miniseries, will scare you! Besides the cheesy ending, this is top-notch horror that will change the way you view clowns forever.My girlfriend, Carly,testifies that this IS the scariest movie she has ever seen.This is Stephen King's best novel-to-movie, along with The Shining,another movie I recommend.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This was one of the first anime movies I have seen and it got me hooked. No other type of animation can compare to Miyazaki's wonderful fantasy about the competition of the forest and the human civilization. <BR>Though Disney released this and its animated, this isn't a movie for small children, and maybe not for some adults either! But the animation is spectacular, the story and plot wonderful, and this is a must-see for any anime (or animal) lover!
B000002KXV|5.0|I bought this in 1982 and loved it immediately. What's not to like? Interesting stories; fabulous arrangements; top-notch musicianship; impeccable production. Worth it just for Maxine and New Frontier, but every song is a gem. Fagen is a national treasure. If 43 five-star ratings out of 45 isn't enough to make you buy this CD, perhaps 44 out of 46 will push you over the edge. Consider yourself pushed and enjoy the ride down. You will not regret it.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I had seen John Mayer's video for &quot;No Such Thing&quot; for several weeks on VH1's countdown and really enjoyed the song. Normally, I wouldn't just jump in and buy an artist over one song, but he really seemed to have something going. <br />I was really impressed. An intelligent Dave Matthews with some nice, soothing sounds and thoughtful lyrics. The first time through the album, I kinda felt bored. But, the second &amp; subsequent trips through have me hooked. <br />The first track, &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, is an easy stand-out. But, I also really loved &quot;Love Song For No One&quot; (boy, I can relate to that one 100%) and &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot;. A track that I hope he'll release in time for Christmas is &quot;St. Patrick's Day&quot; -probably one of the nicest seasonally-inspired songs I've heard. It's a great song to listen to during a snowstorm, cuddled up next to the fireplace. <br />Overall, I think John's great some great stuff on the album. It's a solid debut and I'm already looking forward to the next release. Definitely recommended.
0446677450|5.0|This is an excellent book that describes in clear and easy-to-understand steps how to understand how money works.  It helps readers understand how we can make our money work for us rather than having to work so hard to get the money we want.  It encourages us to change our mindset from &quot;I can't afford that!&quot; to &quot;How can I afford that?&quot;  It helps us realize that we often work so hard to get money but when it comes to getting our money to work for us, we're generally lazy.<br />My library can't keep this book on their shelves (I had to wait three weeks in reserve with four copies in distribution at my local library).  A definite must-have.
B0000019HU|5.0|One of my top ten albums ever.  There are very few albums I've heard that match the emotional intensity of Spiderland.  You must listen to the albums as a whole - the individual tracks just don't work on their own.  Throughout the album, Slint builds an emotional time bomb which detonates at about 6m30s through \\"Washer\\".  Absolutely devastating moment. It's impossible to compare Slint to anything else, and it still amazes me that this was released 11 years ago.
B00006DXXL|4.0|Paramount did a fine job upgrading the sound and video for dvd, but made no effort at all in special features. This is something dvd collectors have come to expect, so this disc is a disappointment.
B00005JKOI|5.0|Pretty In Pink is the classic story of love on the wrong side of the tracks done up in 1980's Brat Pack style from producer John Hughes.  80's teen queen Molly Ringwald stars as Andie, the poor girl whose mother walked out of her and her father's (Harry Dean Stanton) life and caused her father to go into an emotional tailspin.  She works at a small, but hip record store with her quirky, but older friend Iona (Annie Potts) and pals around with Duckie (Jon Cryer), her best friend who secretly loves her.  Andrew McCarthy is Blane the rich and popular boy who falls for Andie despite his friends, including the lecherous Steff (James Spader), balking at him for going out with poor white trash.  The film has a fairly formualmatic plot, but it is elevated above the simple story by wonderful performances by the three leads.  Ms. Ringwald is supremely sweet and you feel for her in her tough situation.  Mr. McCarthy is amiable as a someone caught between his feelings and friends and Mr. Cryer adds the perfect amount of comedy relief to his character.  Mr. Spader is also quite good in his role, but he seems too old to be a teenager and is just a little out of place.  The soundtrack to the film is first rate and the album peaked at number five on the charts.  This was the last big hit for Ms. Ringwald and the film marked her end as the teen queen of films. Look for a young Andrew Dice Clay who has a bit part in the film as a bouncer at a club Andie frequents.

And yes, \\"Where would you be\\" is the greatest song ever, don't think anyone can sing with such great strenght as Martina. Saw the live-preformance on TV and I was just stunned! I got gooze-bumps the first time and now after the hundred time I still do. LOVE YOU MARTINA!
B000067CPX|5.0|Simply beautiful. Those are the only words that come to my mind when I listen to certain songs on this cd. Songs such as Dosed, Zephyr Song, and Tear are a few of my favorites. Yes, I know, this is very different from the Chili Peppers we used to know. However, to expect them to put out the same thing they did 10 years ago would be extremely selfish to ask for. This is a wonderful and mature album by these guys. Good Job RHCP!

This really is a show to remember!

It shows you how they developed &quot;bullet time&quot;. Anyway, once again I say, BUY THIS DVD!!! It is awesome!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko was easily one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Not only did it have a meaning (unlike most of the movies that Hollywood spits out these days), but it was hilarious to watch as well.  There are rampant 80's jokes, as it does take place in the 80's, including a kid doing coke right in the middle of the school hallway as soon as the principle walks by, not noticing.  The biting cynicism about religion and the way the world is provides for one of the most entertaining and thought provoking movie ever made.  The DVD also includes commentary as well as deleted scenes, which, for anyone who's seen the movie, will definitely want to check out.  This movie's a doozy, so get it!

0140166157|5.0|\\"Hide My Eyes\\" (also published as \\"Tether's End\\") is one of Margery Allingham's more atypical works.  Rather than take their normal place as main characters, Albert Campion and Charlie Luke appear only occasionally.  They serve to provide vital context and to move the plot along, but they do not take part in direct action until the book is almost over.<br />The tale is about a seemingly unconnected series of killings which Luke is convinced are related somehow.  First, a bus with a strange old couple in it is used to transport a victim from a crime scene and then vanishes.  Then another old couple sets out for South Africa and disappear.  Some Jewelry from an unsolved murder turns up unexpectedly.  All of these events tie into Luke's old patrol, Goff's Square, and Garden Green<br />While Campion and Luke try to fit the pieces together, the narrator moves on, shifting from the murderer's point of view to that of several important and delightful characters.  Young Annabel Tassie has come to London at the invitation of her Aunt Polly.  Polly runs a museum of peculiarities originally collected by her late husband.  Having never met Aunt Polly, Annabel calls on Richard Waterfield, an old friend to keep an eye out for her.  Richard, who is starting out his professional life in the big city, has not seen Annabel since he failed to marry her sister, and is greatly affected by the changes in his old chum.  I believe it takes him about 5 seconds to fall totally under her spell.<br />It is Richard and Annabel who are the true main characters.  Their separate adventures, Annabel with Aunt Polly, and Richard with the murderer that Luke and Campion are hunting, provide the main backdrop for the tense and chilling story of a killer who is gradually spinning out of control.  Their paths weave through restaurants, clubs, barbershops, and city dumps until at last they come together in the small museum across from Garden Green.<br />This is an intricate and thrilling tale, a disturbing look into the mind of a charming sociopath, and an intriguing study of London life at the end of the 1950's.  As she did in \\"Tiger in the Smoke,\\" Margery Allingham turns from comfortable writing habits to show a rare expertise with psychological fiction.  I am quite confident that the Allingham fan will find it irresistible.g look into the mind of a charming sociopath, and an intriguing study of London life at the end of the 1950's.

B000002KOJ|4.0|It's often said that Joni Mitchell first came into her own on this album. I would disagree. It's hardly a quantum leap from the first LP (sometimes referred to as JONI MITCHELL and sometimes as SONG TO A SEAGULL). Both albums are quality late 60s folk, with a few hints of the artistic adventuressness to come. What CLOUDS does have are some of songs already made famous by other artists, which, not insignificantly, she had penned prior to even beginning her recording career. Tactically, it was actually a pretty smart move NOT to record \\"Both Sides Now,\\" \\"Tin Angel\\" or \\"Chelsea Morning\\" until her sophomore effort. Fans may have been dying for her versions of those songs, but if her fledgling effort had included them, it would have only proved what people already knew: that she had written a few good tunes. <br />Remember how Karla Bonoff's (much later) debut contained all three songs that Linda Ronstadt had already made famous, plus one that Bonnie Raitt had already recorded)? The implication was that Karla didn't have that much more up her sleeve (not an entirely fair assessment, but hard to avoid under the circumstances). Joni was actually quite canny in parceling out the pre-existing \\"hits\\" over the course of her first three albums (the only ones from SONG TO A SEAGULL being the title track, which had been recorded by Buffy Ste. Marie and \\"Michael From Mountains\\" which Judy Collins had done earlier--and she held off on recording a crowd pleaser like \\"The Circle Game\\" until her THIRD album). She thereby proved that she already had a wealth of material and that she was hardly a flash in the pan.<br />Less of a concept album than her debut, CLOUDS' focus is more on the individual songs, to be sure. In that sense, it may be viewed as a stronger album, since the individual songs are SO good. She was also gaining confidence as a singer and has a number of stunning vocal moments on this album. Her double tracked vocal on a track like \\"Songs to Aging Children Come\\" actuallyelevates one of her weaker, drippier lyrics into something quite special. Not all her vocal moves work so well, sometimes she seems to be striving for dramatic effect (as on \\"Tin Angel\\") and winds up just going flat. But even those occasional awkward moments do not undercut the entire song. <br />Unlike much of her later, more experimental work, CLOUDS is impressive mostly in its stark simplicity. On most tracks, it's just Joni's vocal accompanied by her guitar. One can really get a sense of her much vaunted guitar work, her unique open tunings. Her a capella \\"Fiddle and the Drum\\" always seemed a little forced to me, but I must admit that given the present political environment her stern anti-war, anti-unilateralism ballad takes on new significance.<br />CLOUDS is, as some have suggested, a good introduction to the work of Joni Mitchell, although for your more musically conservative friends and relatives, you may need to throw in a few caveats (\\"It's not ALL as tuneful as this one, Mom!\\"). Indeed there are many people who probably won't want to advance much more beyond this record and its follow-up, LADIES OF THE CANYON--just as there are others whose attention flags after middle period Joni (BLUE, FOR THE ROSES and COURT & SPARK). And well, that's OK. You can't bring everyone along with you every step of the way (although from Mitchell's own comments, I sometimes wonder if she blames critics, record company execs and radio programmers more than her own later obscurantism for her gradual falling off in sales). Whatever the case, if there is one record that could accurately be called \\"Mitchell for the Masses,\\" this is it. Not that that's a bad thing!
0380820846|5.0|I'd waited a long time to read this, and thought it was Quinn's best yet. The sub plot of discovering the identity of Lady Whistledown allow Penelope &quot;The Wallflower&quot; Featherington and Colin &quot;The Charmer&quot; Bridgerton to discover themseves... and each other. <BR>Fast paced, witty dialogue had me laughing out loud, and some beautiful moments(especially the ball scene at the end) had me tearing up. This was  different and better than some of the other things Quinn has written becuase of the careful, believable and just plain old excellent characterization.<BR>This book isn't as &quot;fluffy&quot; (sorry, Mz. Quinn) as some of her other work.<BR> <BR>I have to admit, though, I was a little sad that Lady Whistledown is no more. But that won't stop me from reading more-I eagerly await Eloise's story.<BR>I reccomend checking out the other Bridgerton books, especially &quot;How to Marry a Marquis&quot; and &quot;How to Catch an Heiress&quot;.
6303148352|4.0|The graphics in Jurassic Park are what made the movie what it is, if they had staid with Phil Tippet and &quot;go-motion&quot; I bet this would have been Speilburgs biggest flop and the &quot;begining of the end&quot;. But luckily ILM decided to push it and blew the world away. <br />But in it lies its fault. The &quot;wow&quot; factor has become mundane and this computer technology now seems to almost ruin films instead of making them stand out. If you didnt see Jurassic Park when it first came out then its hard to grasp the feeling you had. I dont think the first ten times I saw it I knew what the plot was, I didnt care because it just was so amazing to see. But now the fun is wearing off, lets hope number 4 does it right...
B00006F7S4|5.0|Having read loads of the reviews on this album, I'm aware that some people have drawn comparisons with Dylan, but I haven't heard much of his stuff. I can just about recognise that some guy who has worked on Radiohead material has also had something to do with it, but I've only got one of their albums. The only reference that I can offer is that it somehow sounds like Eels in places (and that's no bad thing) and a little like The The from time to time. There is clearly a gap in my musical knowledge and I look forward to filling it. The problem is, I can't envisage a day when I won't want to listen to \\"Sea Change\\" from opening to closing my eyes. This is everything that an album could be. Those who complain that it's depressing and dark have kinda missed the point. This is understated, subtle, moving and intentional. It's so refreshing to hear an artist like Beck not being led by the mass market or the dictates of a record label and going with what so evidently felt right. It's an album that for some people would fit those long \\"just me and a bottle\\" nights, but listen carefully and I reckon you'll find new layers and like me, adopt it as a permanent soundtrack. Cheers Beck, I needed this.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie actually has people playing roles who &quot;look&quot; like they're in high school. Well, except Heath Ledger who looked more of a college kid. Anyway, the story was sweet and Julia Stiles ruled the movie just by that one scene where she was table dancing. Larisa Oleynik did a great job playing snobby, superficial Bianca, which was a total 180 from her famous Alex Mack character on Nick. This movie gets 5 stars.
B000002H6C|3.0|Call me a cliche but nothing after Master Of Puppets was really much good. Many people rate this album, but I (despite trying SO hard to like) have never thought much of it.<br />The idea of progressive thrash is a great one, but while this is far more progressive than most of the material on Master Of Puppets, on Puppets the epic stuff worked. Here, it's just so overdrawn and boring. The production is some of the worst I've ever heard. The album sounds like its been recorded in a dustbin with a dictaphone. For the most part, it lacks energy, is not at all heavy (the sound is thinner than a piece of paper) and most of songs actually lack the speed associated with earlier Metallica. It's not that I don't like complex music (or music that is not fast and heavy) - I listen to a wide variety of rock and metal, ranging from Frank Zappa to Cryptopsy and Gordon Giltrap to Satyricon. One of my favourite bands are Dream Theater, who aren't exactly well known for their simple songs and their sloppy musicianship.<br />There are two songs worth it though - Blackened still has a cool riff, and I love that little intro thing - whatever it is (that quiet humming noise). The other (by far the best song on the album, and certainly ahead of Blackened) is One. This is the haunting tale of a young man has lost his arms and legs in war and is basically a vegetable, but has to be kept alive (presumably for legal reasons). The music is very progressive, starting with a quiet, tranquil riff and building up to a fast heavy ending. The lyrics are also some of the best Metallica have ever written, exploring this man's thoughts and his anger at what has happened to him. There are some other good moments - the intro to the title track is great, if only for the over complexity of it, while the main riff to Harvester Of Sorrow is very catchy (I hate using that word about a metal band, especially when reviewing an album like this who's appeal lies lies in anything but attempted catchy-ness).<br />All in all though, this is pretty poor. If you don't own anything by Metallica then buy Master Of Puppets.All in all though, this is pretty poor. If you don't own anything by Metallica then buy Master Of Puppets.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon did such a great job playing Elle Woods. Sure, the plot is a little far-fetched. Come on, airhead girl who works her ass off to get into Harvard Law actually gets in....and she only does it to try and get back with her ex boyfriend! She goes through hell when she's there and then....okay I won't spoil it, but this movie really is cute though. It's so not real. Hence, the perfect movie!
0316666343|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and yet, when it first came out I didn't think it would be my kind of book.  Told from a 14-year old's point of view after her murder, it is horrifying, funny, sad, and hopeful.  It is how one family and the people in the town who interact with them react to the death of that family's daughter.  I was pleased that the author did not try to make Susie into a ghost that keeps in touch with family and friends.  It was more real in that she did not contact her family and friends on a human level from \\"her heaven\\" other than by concentration of thoughts.  Well done, but keep tissue nearby.
B000002UAU|5.0|35 years ago, the Beatles released their landmark album 'Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band', and the world of popular music would never be the same. The album sounds as if it were a dream the was forged into Lennon and McCartney's minds, make an album, title it after an imaginery group, and try to be that group on the record(and let Ringo sing lead for the first time). With just a look at the album cover, it makes you think that this could be something more than an album, it could be a soundtrack for the generation ansd generations to come. The Beatles certainly raised the bar musically with their arrangements and experimentations on this album, but they also showed that change could be a godd thing, and when you are tired of being the same band on every single record, try being another band.
0553579908|5.0|Just wanted to chime in with everyone else. This book picks up where A GAME OF THRONES left off. It continues with it's amazing detail, action, and gritty reality. I love this series and can't wait until &quot;A Feast For Crows&quot; comes out.
B00006ADFL|4.0|Pauline (Melanie Lynskey), a loner, is befriended by Juliet (Kate Winslet) at school.  Juliet who is in need of friendship and belongingness finds Pauline to be the perfect friend. The two of them create a new fantasy world of which the often write and talk about.  They spend every possible moment together, and they acknowledge that they are need each others company.  Their parents become growingly concerned about their friendship when it stretched the moral borders.  Heavenly Creatures is a dark film based on a true story that depicts the troubles of coming to age when the notion does not conform to popular beliefs.
0553573403|5.0|I picked this book up without any knowledge of George R. R. Martin or this series whatsoever. The Lord of the Rings movie got me re-interested in reading fantasy books and I read the LOTR trilogy and The Silmarillion and anything else Tolkien-related I could find. After re-reading the LOTR for the second time in 3 months, I realized I needed to find something else to read. I picked this book up in a bookstore on the recommendation of the clerk there &quot;if you like LOTR, you'll like this.&quot;<br />I picked it up a month ago and Clash of Kings and Storm of Swords were out as well, but I figured I'd pick up the first volume just to see how I liked the series. I've since read ALL THREE books and am waiting with anticipation for &quot;A Feast For Crows&quot;<br />Anyway, there's a number of great reviews here. Basically, this is a must-read for any fantasy fan. It's gritty reality is what really makes it unique (this book is not for the squeamish -- it's the &quot;Braveheart&quot; or &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; of fantasy series).
B00005JL78|4.0|Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is working on the pre-crime division that prevents murders by seeing into the future through three pre-cogs, gifted individuals that can see into the future through dreams.  John firmly believes in a pre-crimes system, but there are those who have a different opinions such as detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell).  Shortly after Witwer's arrival, the pre-cogs have dream of John being a murderer, which is shocking to John.  A stunned John escapes the pre-crime unit while trying to figure out who is setting him up, after all John has never meet this stranger that he supposedly will kill.  Minority Report is an exciting sci-fi film that has many interesting viewpoints that will entertain the audience.
0553381709|5.0|Not wanting to spoil anything, but there was a chapter I was reading one evening (had something to do with a wedding) and after I finished the chapter, I was so ... I couldn't go to sleep. Not ... at the book -- ... at a certain group of characters responsible for some real atrocities committed in the particular chapter. The book just really pulls you in and you forget these people aren't real. The fact that there are two books in the series before this book (A GAME OF THRONES, A CLASH OF KINGS) makes you all the more attached to the characters in the book.<br />By the time I finished the book, I was pumped up for my favorite characters and can't wait until A FEAST FOR CROWS comes out.<br />I've seen some people saying this is better than Tolkien. Not quite. Tolkien can get a little tedious sometimes, whereas Martin usually always has something interesting happening. However, this isn't quite Tolkien. Tolkien's development of the elvish languages, the songs, and the immense back story add a lot more depth. Still, this is the kind of story that Tolkien-fans will really enjoy. This series isn't for kids, however. There's a lot of sex and violence. In many ways, this series is a lot more realistic than LOTR -- but it's that realism that should probably keep it out of young kids' book collections.
0316666343|2.0|Not as well-written as I had hoped...I had to read some sentences several times to make sense of them.  Found it hard to become engaged by the characters and care about what happened to them.  Many instances of dissonance and downright dichotomy in the story.
B000066NW0|5.0|Reading the reviews I see that a lot of people have good things to say about Avril Lavigne. I think she is great! One of the reviews I read is totally absured. I do not agree with a single thing said by the reviwer so I must set the record strait so that someone looking to buy the CD doesnt let these absured views affect their choice. <BR>     I know people have the right to their opinon but how can you say that Avril Lavigne is not unique. It is so easy to feed people the same garbage that other so called &quot;pop princesses&quot; like Britney Spears. People like her are what it wrong with the music industry today and people who can't recognise that are very dumb. Avril Lavigne has a very unique voice and she brings positive messages to a crowd that is often fed the same explicit lyrics in a million songs that all sound the same. <BR>     In this review the reviewer says that all of her songs sound like a nine year old talking about ex boyfriends. Most of her songs have nothing to do with guys so I have no clue where that came from. <BR>     Many of the songs talk about important life lessons and I hope that if you are a young person or a parent looking to buy this CD for your child that you do, and quick because Avril gives some very insightful observations and opinons on life that every person should know and the younger the better. <BR>     So do yourself a favour and buy this CD. As long as you dont want the same garbage that is always out there then get it becasue Avril is unique and her songs send very important messages.
B000066NW0|4.0|I like almost all the songs on this CD, but I made a mistake. I took it to church and played the entire thing through until about song 4. A couple swear words, but nothing major compared to other stuff out there. <br />1. Losing Grip-- It's an okay track, but not my favorite. It's a good opening song for this disk, but everything is pretty tame compared to this. <br />2. Complicated-- The most overplayed song in the history of the world. I've heard ten billion times, but still love it. <br />3. Sk8er Boi-- Ignore the stupid misspelling, and this song is great. Even a couple guys from church want this CD because of this song. <br />4. I'm With You--The song I referred to earlier. The worst part of this song is that the cuss word is in the chorus, so it says it several times. Not one I can play at church. But as far as cursing, it's as tame as a Garth Brooks CD.<br />5. Mobile-- It took me about two days to get the meaning of this song. I don't really care for it though.<br />6. Unwanted-- Bleh. This song sucks.<br />7. Tomorrow-- See above. <br />8. Anything but Ordinary-- I could listen to this song on repeat all day long. 'Sometimes I get so weird, I even freak myself out' is probably the best lyric on the whole CD. <br />9. Things I'll Never Say-- This song is okay, not the greatest, but I can stand it. <br />10. My World-- She sounds so much like Alanis Morrisete in this song. Good thing I like Alanis, or this song would suck. <br />11. Nobody's Fool-- This one is fairly good. <br />12. Too Much To Ask-- Ooh, PRETTY LYRICS! <br />13. Naked-- Nothing like 'Barenaked' by Jennifer Love Hewitt. This one is normal, for the most part. <br />Tis one is worth your money!
B0000524CY|5.0|This is the scariest movie ever made! I almost couldn't make it through. Gave me nightmares for weeks, and some images are still playing my mind. Scared me the first 3 times I saw it!

It is not Washington's best but is excellent nevertheless.<br />What I really like about this DVD is the care which they had taken to create it. The picture is superb, the sound is unblievable. It is my current demo DVD whenever I want to demo my Home Theatre.<br />Get it now. It is a joy to watch this movie.

It has by far the best dialogue of any movie in the last 30 years.  The all star cast was asked to stretch themselves to deliver performances of a lifetime.  I could ramble on here forever, filling up pages about how I feel about this movie.  So go buy the DVD before they change their minds! :)

B0000630BT|2.0|Priest seemed like a drunken guy that does not know where to go in the middle of a dark street...<br />They tried to go glam and hair-metal with the awful TURBO and then they release the \\"techno\\" bomb, RAM IT DOWN. Then Dave Holland was fired, and came great drummer Scott Travis.<br />So, they released the \\"Ultimate\\" heavy metal album. THis is not true. IN PAINKILLER, Priest reached an all-time dumbness in lyrical department,a total stupidity. Also, the album sound terribly dated today, while SAD WINGS OF DESTINY, SIN AFTER SIN, BRITISH STEEL and UNLEASHED IN THE EAST don't.<br />PAINKILLER was a pleasant punch in the stomach at those days (1990), because it came right after the worst albums Priest has ever made (TURBO and RAM IT DOWN. But now, 12 years later, we can see how bad it is. The good point is that Tipton and Downing are soloing like bats from hell here, erally amazing.
B00006F7S4|4.0|If you are a casual Beck fan by way of &quot;Odelay&quot; and the like, 'Two turntables' genre.  This album may not be for you.  This Beck album is very unlike that style and you may be disappointed.  However, if you like a wide variety of music you should definitely give this a chance.  The best way to describe this album is similiar to Mutations, but with a more acoustic undercurrent.  Only instruments found in nature are used. <br />This album and Mutations both showcase Becks ability to create excellent music without excessive use of computer effects and distortion.  Sea Change reveals all of Beck's insides at present, he is sad.  But voices it beautifully in this.  I recommend the free DL's, very representative for the album.  This CD is excellent to just sit down and chill or get work done too.  But let me just say this again, if you give it a chance, you'll enjoy this album.    <br />I'd have to say that thus far, my favorite Beck album is Mutations.  I think there's only one song on that album I don't really enjoy.  My recommendation is that if you don't own Mutations, you should get it first.  It's an album not to miss.

She doesn't make heaven sound attractive, nor does she seem particularly happy there. She is more concerned with the people she left back on earth. The heaven parts and what the author imagined its residents can do were boring and not very believable.<br />.... Most of the characters seemed more isolated from each other than from Susie. I didn't see any preparation or motivation for the mother's sudden desire to have sex with the detective working on her daughter's death.

B00001PE4D|4.0|With Reese Witherspoon riding high with \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" & \\"Legally Blonde,\\" I wanted to revisit this movie where she stars with her real-life husband Ryan Phillippe.  I think there was a chemistry between the two of them; it made Sebastian's (Ryan Phillippe) change seem believable as the character fell in love.  The plot is a marvelous lesson in superficiality, especially with a bold cameo appearance by Christine Baranski.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is delightfully evil as the sister.  Joshua Jackson does a nice cameo as a gay drug user; he switches characters when he places a phone call into a campy queen.  Sean Patrick Thomas who is on tv's \\"The District\\" does a nice cameo as the music teacher who tries to seduce Cecile.  Selma Blair's Cecile made me wonder if someone could be that inexperienced.  The kiss between her & Geller showed how far the sister Kathryn would go to corrupt.  Witherspoon seems so wholesome, but does bring a realistic quality to a movie that badly needed the realism.  Overall, this is an enjoyable and entertaining little romp.  The pool scene was fun.  The ending seemed a bit contrived with Sebastian giving up his life for his true love; but it made Kathryn's getting her just deserts all the more sweet.  Enjoy!  I did.
0876855575|5.0|Pick this book up and you will not be able to put it down.  The story of a boy's upbringing held hostage by the hard hands and angry mouth of his father.  Bukowski was the ultimate outsider, emotionally and physcially separated from world, a black-eyed prey who learns to fight back with scrapped knuckles and sharp words, all captured here for your reading enjoyment and emotional enlightment.  Reading this book is a one-two punch to the head, wonderfully enchanting prose that makes you appreciate how much you have given as compared to the society's discards and a lesson on how to breath words into living sentences.  His words flow like melted bitter-sweet chocolate.  Bukowski is authentic and gifted -- put his books next to Hemingway on your bookshelves.  (check out his poetry.)

6300183971|1.0|This movie is just as bad as it always was. Dune is one of the best Sci-fi novels of all time. It was a 600 page novel telling an epic story of the human race 8000 years in the future. However, Dune presents a different view of the future than almost any other sci-fi would. There are two major differences. First off, there are no aliens in Dune, humans are alone in the Universe. Secondly, humans are not allowed to use computers or any sort of A.I.(probably to avoid a future similar to The Matrix) As a result, humans are extremely advanced in the area of mental development, but lacking in almost everything else. In order to make up for the lack of computers, very unique breeds of humans have developed. One is the guild navigators who are bred to be able to navigate through space-time folds and essentially allow humans to warp through hyperspace. There are also mentats, who are essentially trained at birth to think like a calculator(even simplistic calculators are forbidden in this universe). There are even warrior breeds, like the emperor's Sardaukar.<br />Probably the most important are the guild navigators, they are the ones who allow humans to break the speed of light. They are the ones who make intergalatic travel possible. However, they rely on a single resource to give them the ability to travel through hyperspace. This resource is found on only one planet in the universe, it is known as melange, or simply, spice. It is only found on Arrakis. Dune. Desert planet. A planet with winds and temperatures so harsh that it is only habitable near the polar regions. It's also filled with 400 foot worms that travel beneath the sand and will eat anything that moves. Without the spice, humans would be isolated to their own planets forever(or at least until they reinvented computers). Consequently, spice has become the most valuable resource in the universe. It's also an addictive drug which gives you telepathic abilities and makes you live to age of 130. Although why 8000years have gone by without anyone ever finding a cure for aging is mystery. I mean, there was a classic X-files episode where this guy found a cure for aging by implanting a serial killer with the DNA of a salamander. You'd think 8000 years would be enough for them to try something like that, oh well, back to the review. Another thing worth mentioning is that people don't fight with laser guns as in most sci-fis, they fight with knives. The reason for this is because the only thing that pierces a force shield is a slow moving object. As a result, we also have humans who are trained as masters of knife-fighting.<br />So what does all this have to do with the movie? Absolutely nothing. In the first battle sequence the Sardaukar come in with robotic suites and automatic weapons, go figure. This movie makes no sense whatsoever. If computers are banned then why do you constantly see things that would require computers to build? There are so many inconsistencies with the book it's ridiculous. The shields still exist, even though everyone is fighting with hi-tech weapons, but they look like orange boxes, when they are supposed to be invisible. Nobody actually uses them except for one guy, and he gets killed by a stunner(a gun which if fired perfectly by a highly trained warrior can go through a shield). The Atreides are developing some sort of sonic weapon. Where the hell did Lynch ever come up with this idea? Now you got the Fremen, who are supposed to be fighting with sandworm teeth, fighting with guns that blow things up when you yell \\"Muad'Dib\\" into them. The ornithopters are gone and have been replaced by these hovercraft thingies. And why the heck does the Baron Harkonnen, who is the dictator of one of the most powerful houses in the universe, float around in this suit thingy that resembles long underwear? He is SUPPOSED to be wearing very elaborate clothing decorated with expensive gemstones, why does he look like a half-naked rotting fat man? Don't even get me started on the \\"heart plugs.\\"<br />The casting is absolutely horrible. Paul Atreides looks like Eric from \\"That 70's Show.\\" Duke Leto looks like he came straight out of a Barbara Streissand movie. Paul's mother goes bald(don't ask). Chani looks nothing like she was described in the book. And as for the Baron Harkonnen, what happened to him? Lynch ruins the Harkonnens by trying to make them seem really disgusting and evil. One of the interesting things about the book is that the Harkonnens weren't actually evil, they just thought and acted differently from the Atreides. They were cruel and savage, they were based on the Romans, but they were nothing like how they are portrayed in the movie. The book actually gives the internal monologues of the Harkonenns several times, and they don't seem all that unusual. There is ONE character who is well cast and that is Sting as Feyd-Ratha. He's also the only person in this movie I've ever heard of. Unfortunately Lynch removed practically every scene with him in it, and he is reduced to a couple of lines. Why did Lynch have to take out the gladiator scene with Feyd-Ratha? That was one of the best scenes in the book, why did he feel the need to remove it? In fact the only knife fight left is the most important one, and it's hardly impressive.<br />Bottom line, this movie stinks, and is nothing like the book. The 2000 version, on the other hand, is superb, despite the lack of a budget. It follows the book almost exactly and it's six hours long, so it doesn't feel rushed. I don't know why Lynch felt he was qualified to mess with the genius of a writer like Frank Herbert, but he completely butchers the book.
0345451325|4.0|I found out about this book after playing the game that it is based on. Anyone who has played Halo can vouch for the fact that once you get a taste of Halo, you can't possibly get enough. So I brought this book home expecting it to just help satiate my thirst for the Halo universe. What I got was a near full-immersion. I felt like I was on the battlefront alongside the human defenders. If you know the game, this book will provide a riveting experience that's hard to find.<BR>     Still, this book wasn't without its flaws. I noticed several continuity flaws (not between the book and the game, those would be forgiveable). For example, a certain character, within the span of 5 pages, goes from beng female to male and back to female again. I dont know about other readers, but errors like this always annoy me. The book also feels like it was cut short, with little of the book actually detailing the fall of Reach. Yet even in light of the bad things, I recommend this book to any fan of the game. It will make you see the game in a light you never would have before...

B00005JLKB|5.0|i love this show. it has been the best show i've watched so far. even better than friends or the simpsons. it has everything you need romance, action, wierdness, and even comedy. when i first went to amazon to check it out i was so mad that it didn't even have a realease date on it yet. if you buy this movie you will have one of the best shows in the world. it was in the top 10 in the best dvd awards. trust me you will get so into it you just watch one episode.
B00005OC06|4.0|Here we have a great recording with the essencial Butterly herself. The music and singing is superb. Unfortunately as the singers are lipsinking rather badly with silly costumes, and rather bland acting.. you have to wonder if you shouldnt just buy the CD. there are a few nice moments.. un bel di.. che tua madre... and of course the finale.. but overall.. I'd much rather have freni on DVD in operas where she's actually singing and acting.. like Adrianna.. which is fantastic.
B00004VVNB|4.0|UPDATED FOR BLU-RAY VERSION 11/12/09<br /><br />For those thinking of upgrading to the Blu-ray of \\"Logan's Run\\" there's good news and bad news. The bad news is that while this does improve on the original DVD, it's not a huge jump in quality. The film needs some restoration and it appears this is a new transfer (the same one that was used for the reissued DVD with the same cover). The image quality is soft throughout lacking the sharp image quality that you'd expect from a recent film or one that has been restored.<br /><br />The other bit of bad news is that we get none of the extras that were included on the old three disc laserdisc instead getting only the original special features ported over from the DVD (which is good news in a way since this could have been bare bones).We also get the commentary track featuring director Michael Anderson, star Michael York and costume designer Bob Thomas discussing the making of the film.<br /><br />Anderson points out in the commentary track WHY there are some plot holes (the film under went some heavy editing to allow more showings per day and move it from a potential \\"R\\" rating to \\"PG\\")but it's a pity that none of this footage has been found or and restored for a director's cut more than likely the footage is missing.<br /><br />(The 2002 original soundtrack album CD by the way notes some of the sequences in the booklet that were cut including a longer sequence in the ice cave with box--cut to earn a PG rating and some other sequences which appear to be lost)<br /><br />The flaws in the film are less of an issue for me 33 years later. Sure, the production design can be cheesy at times but \\"Logan's Run\\" is a product of its time. The themes examined by Anderson and screenwriter David Zelag Goodman still does a good job even if the last third of the film falls apart.<br /><br />The 5.1 mix sounds pretty good overall which is more good news but it would have been nice to have Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score available as an isolated track. The score is availabe here [[ASIN:B0006SSQ5W Logan's Run [Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]]which 73 minutes of Jerry Goldsmith's praised score.<br /><br />Many of the visual effects look dated with the miniature work in particular leaving a lot to be desired but the for time it was pretty good. The matte paintings by Matthew Yurichich are one of the few highlights of the visual effects in the film.<br /><br />Logan's Run started off with a pretty amazing concept--(courtesy of science fiction writers William F. Nolan and George Clayton Johnson)what if our youth obsessed society put everyone over the age of 30 (21 in the novel)to death as a means of population control? This film version of a classic cautionary tale is intermittantly successful. David Zelag Goodman's screenplay condenses and changes around several key characters.<br /><br />The basic plot--In the future our society is enclosed in domes. As a means to control the population, everyone has a life clock crystal on their hand. When you reach 30 you have the option to become \\"renewed\\" in a ceremony attended by the citizens. Logan (Michael York) and Francis (Richard Jordan) are Sandmen who hunt, capture/or kill runners (people who choose to not go through renewal and try to escape).<br /><br />Logan is sent undercover by the computer that runs the city to find the location of Sanctuary and uses Jessica (Jenny Agutter \\"Walk About\\")who helps runners escape. He and Jessica discover more than they could possibly imagine.<br /><br />The film is quite good despite some gaping plot holes. Michael York gives a impassioned performance as Logan 5. Jenny Agutter is enchanting as Jessica. Richard Jordan shines as Logan's former partner Francis who feels betrayed and hunts Logan down. Roscoe Lee Brown is exceptional in his cameo as the demented cyborg Box.<br /><br />Logan's Run attempted to tell an adult cautionary tale in a world of light weight escapist movies. It's a commendable film and the film makers frequently bite off more than they can chew. I'd rather have a film that's too ambitious than not at all.<br /><br />Still, I appreciate the ambitions if not the execution. 3 1/2 stars.ers frequently bite off more than they can chew.

0380713802|2.0|First, let me say I'm a Bill Bryson fan.<br />His &quot;A Walk In The Woods&quot; and &quot;In a Sunburnt Country&quot; were brilliant, witty, informative and thoroughly entertaining.  They were, in short, everything this book is not.<br />&quot;Neither Here Nor There&quot; is a travellogue with the emphasis on log.  What we get is a listing of the author's various motels, transportation and meals in different European cities.  This book is heavy on the actual travel and accomodations and very light on the places he's visiting.  In other books, Bryson would tell the story of the place, livening up his observations with fascinating tidbits of history and curiousities that made most of the places interesting in themselves.  In this book, the places seem just an excuse for him to ride the train or bus, change hotels, and drink beer and eat.<br />There are a few -- disappointingly few -- laugh out loud moments in the book.  On the whole, the witicisms and wry observations are replaced by overly long descriptive sentences.<br />This book was written before some of his more recent successes.  The earlier Bryson doesn't compare well with the current model.  I'd skip it (and &quot;Notes From a Small Island&quot; which suffers from some of the same deficiencies) and go to his other books if one is looking for the enjoyable Bryson reads.
0393312836|5.0|If you are a sci-fi fan, love social commentary or think Kubrick's translation of this book was stunning but have never read the book . . .  read it.<br />I've never come across anything else like it.  The style, voice and character of Alex, the narrator and main character, is more than enough to keep the pages turning - and this is just one of the dozens of reasons to pick this up.
0140186409|5.0|There are at least 5 different levels to this story and the more you soak in it the more they are revealed.  The ending is perfect.  It's not a happy book, then again most starvation stories aren't very cheerful.  That's the point.<br />I really like the flow of this book, with the alternating chapters about the characters and the explanations of current economic/social conditions.<br />I read this book for the 1st time im my life while I was in my 30s.  I'm glad I didn't read it in highschool.  Teenagers simply don't have enough life experience to appreciate this book.  How could they understand this when they can simply go to the freezer and take out an instant dinner every time they get hungry?
0151006903|4.0|Umberto Eco is, in my openion, almost without compare as teh literati of the historical epic.  Baudolino does not compare to his other works; however, little does.  Truth or dilusion . . . what is a lie, and what is reality.  Bravo for Baudolino.
B00005B36H|5.0|In three short words.. this album rocks!! People that didn't know who Maynard or Tool were will be very pleased to sink their teeth into this album. A good evolution since Aenema, this album is the perfect soundtrack for the new millenium. And if you really love this album, you will be entertained for a good period of time. Almost 79 minutes to be exact. <br />Everyone that is into metal will tell you that Maynard's voice is unlike any other. His vocal ability seems endless, ever growing and changing. And it's not all about screaming forever, either. While he is &quot;God like&quot; on &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; with screams, his singing ability, showcased on &quot;Lateralis&quot; has also seen loads of improvement and growth since his work with Billy and the rest of A Perfect Circle. <br />Adam Jones is by far one of the greatest guitarists I have ever seen. There is no one song on this album that he doesn't shine on. Guitar players everywhere will appreciate the complexity he brings to the table on this album.<br />What can I say about Justin Chancelor? Everyone that has heard &quot;Schism&quot; knows that this guy can PLAY. His every move is perfectly executed on this album. There are very few people who could keep up with the rest of this lineup, but Justin does just that. <br />Finally we get to (in my opinion) the most amazing member of the group. Danny Carey needs to have someone bowing before him after he completed this album. Some of the most intracate rythms are placed on Lateralus. And if you want balls-to-the-wall drumming listen to &quot;Ticks and Leeches&quot; His chops have grown by leaps and bounds since the last album. <br />In Conclusion this band is amazing. It's no wonder that Maynard has been accused of starting a cult. The playing is amazing, the singing is the closest thing to God as we mortals will ever experience. Hands Down this album rates 5 stars for sheer and raw TALENT.
0316666343|1.0|The premise was what attracted me to the book.  A story written from the view of a deceased teen, from heaven seemed to have great potential.  And the book truly could have been wonderful. It feels like Ms. Sebold stopped writing about half way though.  I finished the book only because I had nothing else to read at the beach.  And that the book still is number one -- I can't explain it.  Skip this one; there are plenty of good books to read.  This is not one of them.
6301008944|3.0|If someone could tell me why some movies have two titles,that would be great......./Anyway//Liz Shue plays a 17 year old babysitter who is stuck babysitting 3 brats(2 are teens)after her conceited boyfriend stands her up for the school hussy.That's NOT where the hardships end.A trip into the city to rescue her best friend who has run away from home and is stuck at an airport with a mob of wackos(including a bald chinese lady with no pants on and a man waving a gun around and grinning)leads to one mishap and dangerous adventure after another.Will they ever make it home b4 the kids parents get home???It is pretty funny,especially Daryl,a smart-mouth who laughs like a deranged loony at everything.When I was 15,this movie actually made me WANT to get stuck in the city with those kinds of scary adventures,which means I'm sorta weird I guess.
B000005JHP|4.0|Kate Bush is a genius.<br />This is a dangerous statement to make. A lot of people view her as a moderately talented kook - if they can remember her at all. However, I believe the statement is a valid one to make. When one listens to the actual music the woman produced, one realizes that only a imaginative, left-of-center genius could have dreampt up the sonic landscapes on an album such as 'Never for Ever.'<br />Lyrics have always been one of Kate Bush's strongest points. On Never for Ever, she is in fine lyrical form. The subjects of the songs vary from nuclear holocaust (the breathtaking 'Breathing'), bed-ridden classical composers ('Delius,') and wedding-night homocide (the compelling 'Wedding List.') On 'Babooshka,' one of Kate's catchiest songs, a jealous wife writes her husband anonymous love notes as a test of loyalty. He only responds so positively to the notes, however, because his wife is so suspicious and withdrawn from him! This is the sort of engaging story that Kate Bush wraps into each song, and the listening is all the more rewarding for it.<br />However, 'Never for Ever' is not all genius (save that for 'The Dreaming' and 'Hounds of Love.') There are spots that shine lyrically, yet fall flat musically. The pretty but musically pointless 'Delius' and the flat 'Blow Away' are examples of both. Their lyrics are typical Kate Bush genius, but the music is lacklustre. On the other extreme, there is 'Violin.' 'Violin' rocks out most satisfyingly, but lyrically it just seems to be Kate proclaiming her love for the violin - she does a good job of it, but it's not exactly subject matter for a deep or spiritually moving musical experience.<br />However, all flaws are forgiven once the squall of 'Violin' (the ending can be basically described as a cat having an orgasm) fades. The final four songs are haunting, epic, glorious in their beauty and stunning in their meaning. The album's crown jewel is 'Breathing,' a song detailing the after-effects of a nuclear blast. The song has made me weep and sent a chill down my spine all of its own power. If the entire tracklisting was \\"Breathing,\\" it would still be worth every cent.<br />To sum up, 'Never for Ever' is the product of a genius coming into her own. It shows glints and promises of the glory that would be 'The Dreaming' and 'Hounds of Love,' but it is not without its flaws. If you are new to Kate, go pick up 'Hounds of Love.' However, if you have heard this album and would like to delve further into the world of Kate Bush, this is an excellent piece of work.
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a horrible and depressing film despite Mr. Washington's superb acting abilities.The problem with black actors as always  is that they have no idea that they are being used (or may be they dont want to know?). <br />This film is not only racist and an affront to blacks and hispanics,but it is also very unfortunate that an accomplish actor like Denzel does not have the courage to turn down a script like this insulting piece of garbage.(He certainly doesn't need it).<br />Black stars in hollywood should be seen as role models and should be making more films about strong and dignify characters rather than selling themselves short like they've been doing throughout the film industry's history.There is nothing wrong in playing bad guys in films but hollywood has made much too little films about black historical figures and way too much about buffoonery and a plethora of stepandfetchit movies. Nothing has changed.<br />This is absolutely tragic!
B00006FDCD|4.0|I've been waiting for this film to come onto DVD for ages, and now I have finally got I can say that it is every bit as good as I remember. Like a lot of people I watched IT when I was quite young, maybe too young coz I do remember having nightmares for weeks about a clown with sharp teeth just appearing from nowhere. And one bit that I think scared me the most was when Annette O'Toole goes into her old house and has tea with the old woman, it made me not want to visit my Gran ever again! The thing IT did teach me was not to talk to or except things off of strangers, so maybe little kids should watch this film. This film isn't just scarey though there are some excellent moments when the kids are getting to know each other, and fight back against the bullies. Also Pennywise is quite funny especially the scene in the library with the exploding balloons.<br />There weren't many special features on this DVD, but what I did like was the cast and director commentry, which was quite interesting.<br />There are three things that I didn't like about this film, and they aren't really major things. The first is that the film is split into two sides of the DVD. I know this was originally a two part mini series but couldn't they put the whole 3 hours on one side of the disk. The second thing is, in the scene near the end of the film when the adults go into the sewer to find IT and they follow the paper boat, you can see the shadow of the camera and camera man against the tunnel wall as it's following the boat. These two things aren't really that bad, but the worse thing is the ending. A lot of people mention this but what an anticlimax... a big spider!!! I can't believe this was the scarest thing Mr King could come up with after the horror that was Pennywise.<br />All that said, I still think this is an excellent horror film that really does scare even 12 years on.
B00000J7A2|5.0|This C.D. Kicks major @ss this is one of the best rock albus I have ever heard if you like wierd tripped out sh!t buy this its the Blues on Acid very very good songs even the bonus trks are excellent.
B000002NAK|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Everything is as it should be. Madonna may not have been the first woman to play Eva, but she is the woman who finally did Eva justice. Everyone else that played her played it bitchy the whole time. Madonna allowed herself to be soft and sentimental when it was needed, such as the beautiful, soaring ballads &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina,&quot; &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall,&quot; and &quot;Eva's Final Broadcast.&quot; Maybe it was just because she was pregnant at the time, but it was the most fragile and sweet I've ever seen her. She did it beautifully. She played it nasty and bitchy on the songs were it was needed like &quot;Good Night and Thank You.&quot;<br />And Antonio...mmm...let's put it this way: I never understand what the fuss about him was til I saw this. He is gorgeous, talented and dang near perfect. Wonderful man. Perfect for Che.<br />The musical may no be entirely historically accurate, but it was like Madonna was channeling Eva anyway. The whole thing is perfect. A must have for any music fan.
0312265859|4.0|but Hard Eight is still an amusing, enthralling, laugh out loud adventure.  Anyone who is familiar with the Stephanie Plum series knows exactly what they are going to get.  Once I started I found it hard to leave it alone (dam!! hubby wanted a meal every now and then!!) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Now I am biding my time waiting for number nine because surely SOMETHING will be resolved in the Stephanie/Morelli/Ranger triangle any minute now!  And in these uncertain times in the world it is a nice mental diversion and great fun to anticipate what the outcome will be.  Come on, Janet, we're waiting for more, more, more!!!
B00005JL3A|4.0|I have to say I wasn't that bothered about seeing this movie at the cinema, I've only played the game a couple of times and didn't really get hooked on it. So I have no idea why I bought it on DVD, but I am glad I did.<br />You don't have to know anything about the story behind the game to enjoy the film. I thought everything was explained really well, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) losing her memory and throughout the film having flashbacks was a good way to do it. The zombies were really well done, and the cgi Licker was good for the ammount of money spent on the picture, even though it sometimes seems as though it does quite fit into it's surroundings, like when it bursts out of it's holding box it looks a bit fake, too computery if thats even a word.<br />The part that surprised me was how fast the commandos die, but more to the point the way they die. The laser mesh was an excellent idea and really well done, even though the director admits it's taken from a film called Cube.<br />The special features were quite good, even though I'm not a Slipknot fan I think the song really suits the film and the music video is pretty cool as well. But the best feature is the feature length commentary. I had never listened to a commentary all the way though until this one. It doesn't just comment about the film but a whole host of other things. Milla and Michelle are really funny along with the director and producer, especially taking the p**s out off Eric Mabius and his yogurt adiction.<br />This is an excellent film, much better than I'd expected, and it is left open for the sequel.
B000069HZP|5.0|If there's a more suspenseful, mind-bending, plot-altering movie made, I haven't seen it - and I've been on the hunt for decades. This movie delivers, with a plot that you simply won't understand until the final moments. Nevermind the dialogue (though don't miss a minute of it). The action, drama, and emotional confusion add up in any language to edge-of-your-seat entertainment. Douglas really delivers!
B0000062S0|4.0|'Walking into Clarksdale' is what we desparately needed from Plant &amp; Page: original material. 'No Quarter', their last team-up album was full of Led Zep material, which was WONDERFUL, but not as refreshing as one might hope. John Paul Jones is needed if these two ever pair up again... &amp; it's been years &amp; years since John Bonham passed away. It's time to bring Led Zeppelin back. All of their solo work proves they've still got it, so why not flaunt it? Newcomers, The White Stripes, have brought back the garage-band/blues sound we used to groove on, so the time is ripe for Led Zep to return.<BR> With incredible tunes like 'Shining in the Light', 'Most High', 'Upon a Golden Horse', &amp; 'Blue Train', from this album &amp; 'Wonderful One' from 'No Quarter', we know these boys can unite &amp; come up with some high quality material. I thoroughly enjoyed 'Walking Into Clarksdale' as an album to be listened to over &amp; over. 'Dreamland', by Plant, is a must-purchase as well.<BR>Come on guys, now is the time, the time is now. Please read the letter. Plant, Page, Jones forever.
B000066NW0|5.0|I listen to a lot of music on MusicMatch Radio--the song \\"Complicated\\" really caught my attention the first time I heard it.  I looked a little closer, watched the video, listened to a few more cuts and finally bought the CD.  Let me tell you, I have a LOT of CDs of all kinds and this is now one of my favorite.  More rock than pop with lots of edgy guitar.  Avril's voice suites her material very well--she always sounds in control of the song.  Highly recommended.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is standing out from all of the other artists about at the moment.  Her catchy debut hit (Complicated) was a smash hit all over the world and it has started the young artist on a rollercoaster of fame.  Let Go is an eclectic album full of all musical tastes that will appeal to a multitude sins and keep everyone happy.  My favouriet tracks are Complicated, Sk8er Boi, Mobile, Too Much To Ask and My world.  I hope that Avril manages to stay craetive all the way through her musical carear and comtinues to bring out gems like this album
0446310786|5.0|I was first assigned to read this book 28 years ago as a freshman in high school.<br />I have since read it at least 4 other times, and each time  enjoy it just as immensely as the prior.<br />Harper Lee captures the deep south in the Depression as well as any author I have seen, and there is nary a note a falseness in the entire book.<br />The only negative here is that this is the only book ever written and published by Harper Lee -- you'll keep wishing for another, but she just got it right the first time.<br />To those us you lucky enough to have not yet read \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", I can only say \\"get thee to the library or a book store, or simply get it from Amazon\\".<br />The hours you'll spend reading this book will be among the most enjoyable you'll ever spend.
B00006DEFA|5.0|An absolute masterpiece of a movie that tells a fascinating story of two men; one with all the musical talent in the world, and one who desires such a thing above all. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is the premier court-composer in Vienna who has everything. One day Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) comes to Vienna and changes his life forever. Salieri seeks musical perfection for himself from God, but is dismayed when he sees it in the vulgar little man Mozart. Abraham plays Salieri perfectly as a man who absolutely adores Mozart's music yet despises Mozart himself. He blames God for choosing Mozart to write the music of the divine and not him. This results in a deep conflict with Mozart, God, and himself. Mozart on the other hand while, very talented, strives for his father's approval, and fights to stay afloat with money and against all those who place a multitude of obstacles in his path to immortality. <br />The third main character of this movie is the music. It is Mozart in all its sublime glory. Pieces are fit perfectly in the movie and often take the movie over all together. We see quite a few of Mozart's operas and a clever parody of Mozart's operas done by his friend. The way Salieri describes the music is some of the greatest verbal descriptions of music ever, and having the music playing in the background as he reads some is a great touch.<br />Perhaps the greatest scene ever filmed is the one when Mozart, on his death bed, is verbally writing the Requiem and Salieri is at his side writing every note down. The play between the two is brilliant and the music integrated into the scene is an awesome touch. <br />The extra scenes while they do not improve upon the film do not diminish it either. Some give more insight but that is about it. It is a definite keeper.<br />Amadeus is a visual, musical, wonderful masterpiece that does Mozart and his music the justice they deserve.
B00006F7S4|5.0|These reviews are fascinating... people either love it or <BR>hate it.  Me, I think it's great... I instantly recognized <BR>the numb pain played in every note. It's a sad beauty I know <BR>well.  Listen to the background noise that wells up on the <BR>first track (The Golden Age).  It's like the first cold winter <BR>wind coming in November.  Unmistakable to those who know it.  <BR>It's how I feel after losing a love.  Done in state of the <BR>art music.  <br />Maybe that's the reason for the two extremes of these reviews; <BR>if you know this kind of pain, this album is better than Prozac. <BR>If you don't, it probably sounds kinda mopey and boring.  <BR>You're lucky and I envy you.  But do yourself a favor.  <BR>Don't sell it back.  Keep it around for a rainy day, and <BR>remember to take it out when you need to.  Beats Prozac.
B00006F7S4|5.0|There isnt really a change of direction on this album, but there is more of a persomal approach coming through.  This album is more personal and painful then his previous outings.  Tracks like Lost Cause, Nothing I Havent Seen, Already Dead, Paper Tiger and Sunday Sun are the ones that make this album complete for me as, as they are the most complete songs on the album.  Although this isnt instantly my favourite Beck album  its up there with the rest of them, and any Beck fan should well and truely appreciate this album, and savour it from start to finish
B00004ZD69|5.0|This is the album.  I don't know if you call it an orchesteral masterpiece, but I would venture to say that this is a &quot;very special album&quot;<br />What do I mean by this?  I talked to my buddy Mario about this album after I had just finished disc one and he was not surprised by my statement &quot;its a very special album.&quot;<br />Very rarely do albums cause a completely sober person to be taken to another place or world, the listener is so drawn in by the complialtion of noises, sounds, and musical arrangements that one's heart actually begins to beat faster and slower as the music reaches its climax and then subsides only to begin another journey.<br />I still don't know how the group can put together such an album, let alone rehearse it, but I am excited to say that this album is one that will change your opinion on the future of modern music.
B00006JDVV|2.0|The trailers led me to expect a mighty man-vs-dragon battle of epic proportions. Stupendous effects, a clever premise (the dragon hibernation cycle and raison d'etre), and good British talent, all could have made for a very entertaining piece of film.<br />Instead, I wasted 3/4 of the run time watchin the development of two or three characters. The dragons, and the setting in which they've placed the cast, becomes secondary. I have nothing against character-driven stories, however, this movie failed to convincingly deliver such a story. And the attempt to do so required the sacrifice of a lot of potentially impressive battles.<br />In short, this one delivers the unexpected - in a displeasing fashion.
B000069HK2|5.0|this cd is so sick.... its one of the best i have. the song \\"choke me\\" is soo [ggod].i recommened that you should get it. they are pretty new but they have [great] awesome music
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is someone who i hadn't heard of until a freind started to tell me about her.  He had purchased her album and was saying that she had the best voice that he had ever heard and that i should give it a listen.  I opted to buy the album after his recommendation and i wasnt disapointed.  With stunning tracks like Come Away With Me, Turn Me On, Lonestar, One Flight Down and Cold Cold Heart, its so easy to see why everyone is going mad for Norah Jones. (congratulations on winning a MOBO award at the recent event you deserve it)
0140177396|4.0|Companionship is a bond between two people who share the same interests and help each other through struggles.  In the book Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck talks about the friendship between two migrant workers, George and Lennie.  George is a small, wiry man that cared a lot about Lennie.  He is usually the one to make the decisions and plans for their future. In contrast, Lennie is large in size, lumbering, and he has a childlike mind.  Lennie¡¦s mental disabilities allow him to completely depend upon George for guidance and protection.  <br />Both George and Lennie shared a common dream.  Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches.   To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream.  The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.<br />This is a great novel to read.  It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest.  It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene.  The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it.  The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess.  Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life.  I strongly recommend this story because it brings laugher, excitement, and tears, and it is a classic you don't want to miss.
1573300403|5.0|Excellent DVD from Sony. It is a master piece of the collection of KING OF POP. The sound is amazing. I used in my HT JBL Pro the sound is purly chanalized and fills the room with the dolby 5.1 which has made everybody dance.<br />The photography / camera, editing compilation is excellent. Can be avoided two similar tracks such as Bille Jen, and against that could have provided any one additional new track. OTHERWISE LIBRARY COPY, one should have it.
0446310786|5.0|\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" thoroughly deserves it's title as a \\"classic.\\"  With the intriguing manner Lee used to explain the events over two years, as well as showing the maturity in Jem and Scout over those two years, this novel has deep meaning.  The title Harper Lee even chose was ingenious.  If more people lived by the saying \\"to kill a mockingbird would be a sin,\\" we would live in more peaceful times.  The main plot of the story is good and evil, and how we let our grudges and prejudices blind us from the truth or what's right.  A must read - I recommend.
B000069AUI|4.0|I thought Coldplay would fail with this album as their previous outing had been so good, but i have to say thet delivered the goods with fine style.  Tracks like Green Eyes, In Place, A Whisper and Daylight draw you in and you dont want to stop listening.  With stunning vocals and music to die for. This is the essential purchase of the year.

Their dream is to earn money to buy a farm of their own where no one ever reaches.   To make this a reality, they found a job at a ranch. At the ranch, George and Lennie encounter many challenges, and they also undergo many struggles to attain their idealistic dream.  The author concludes this novel with a very shocking and unexpected ending.<br />This is a great novel to read.  It is a short and entertaining novel that captures the reader's interest.  It moves in a fast pace with many excellent descriptions in every scene.  The novel was so well written that I was immersed into it.  The author explorers the brotherhood in humans, strengths and weaknesses, and the dream we all possess.  Steinbeck clearly illustrated the impossibility to achieve happiness and freedom - the American Dream, and I definitely can relate the themes to my daily life.  I strongly recommend this story because it brings laugher, excitement, and tears, and it is a classic you don't want to miss.
B00006AG5N|5.0|This collection is a must have for any Elvis fan as it is a coillection of some of his finest work.  Fans of old and new will appreciate this, as it spans through his whole collection, and features his most recent number one, &quot;A Little Less Conversation&quot; (JXL Remix).  Other standout tracks on this album (or ratjer my favourite are, Love Me Tender, Heartbreak Hotel, Jailhouse Rock, Return To Sender and Cant Help Falling In Love With You.  For the price of this cd noboby should be able to resist this little gem.

B0000668IF|4.0|If You Loved Play then you must own this album.  18 is more of an extended session from Play than a new album.  18 is full of classic tracks that has made Moby stand out from the crowd.  Standout tracks are We Are All Made Of Stars, In My Heart, Extreme Ways, Look Back In and Sleep Alone.  Moby is a genius and this album only cements my view.

B000065V41|5.0|Finally, in Michael Caine, we get a Scrooge that is despicable without being disgusting.  In a flawless performance, Michael Caine makes us clamor for Scrooge's redemption, by showing us glimpses of the man he could be. The entrance of Caine as Scrooge and the accompanying song is alone worth the price of the movie.<br />The music invites you to sing along, or weep along as the case may be. and the sets are imaginative and evocative of Christmases we wish we had.<br />You know a film is good when you care about what becomes of a green cloth frog.  To me, this is the best of all possible Christmas Carols.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Puzzled by the dead-split comments on this film? Don't be: it's a *subtle* movie, and Hollywood has just not geared modern audiences for subtlety. No car chases, automatic weapons, or technicolor explosions here.<BR>Yes, it's true that the heavy English accents can be daunting. But attention and thought are rewarded by a rich, coherent story of the sort most moviemakers don't bother with any more. And if you are willing to actually THINK a bit about this movie, there are ongoing worlds of comment on class, wealth, human character, etc. Repeated viewing actually yields more subtleties. The DVD transfers the very good sound and camera work of the film to the small screen about as well as possible.<BR>Gosford Park is a worthwhile addition to the astonishing body of Altman's life's work, and highly recommended to anyone starved of content by the flood of Corporate Mega Blockbusters. <BR>For everybody else, hey, there's always a new Vin Diesel flick coming out...
B00003OSSL|1.0|This movie is the reason there should be ZERO STAR rating at Amazon.  I am quite sure Random Hearts is the worst movie I've ever seen.  Certainly the worst movie ever made with a mega-star like Harrison Ford.<br />Uninspired script, frenetic story line, pathetic performances all combine to make the audience wish that ALL of the characters had gone down in the plane crash together and spared us all the next two hours of agony.  I really feel like I wasted part of my life watching this one.  But I must admit, it's kinda fun to hate it so much.
B00005RFVL|5.0|Robbie Williams' masterpiece &quot;Swing When You're Winning&quot; is a great ablum, with outstanding covers of Capitol's classics. This is really great to play at night. I don't know anything about Robbie; I am not a big fan of his, but I liked this CD. A must have for music fans.
0783231202|5.0|To those that say that this is historically inaccurate: watch the dvd extras. They did to the greatest ability make this movie accurate. And if you go to John Quincy Adam's house preserved today you will find some things like Cinque's chains and other things so he DID MEET HIM. So you historical &quot;experts&quot; are mistaken.<br />Anyway this movie is absolutely excellent. My second favorite movie to crouching tiger, hidden dragon. Speilberg did an excellent job and Anthony Hopkins was Steller as his role as john quincy adams. As I said, many of these negative reviews are mistaken and I disagree Wholeheartedly.

0345446798|4.0|I have a problem dog with fear/aggression to strangers and our dog trainer lent me this book to read on Saturday.  By Sunday - I had read the entire book and it was a remarkable revelation for me.  It's amazing. I now understand better how my dog views the world.  In a way it was sad...the communication gap between primate and canine is larger than I first imagined and my little dog has put up with alot of indignities (hugs, kisses) that would be rude in the dog world.  I guess those of us with small dogs like to think of them as &quot;baby primates&quot; but they are certainly canines first and foremost.  My trainer was right in that this book has allowed me to peek into the psyche of dogs and see the world a little more from their perspective.  It's a valuable experience.
0783225849|5.0|Still scary after all these years, and Hitch didn't need $100-million visual effects--he didn't even need color.  No one can forget the shower scene, where you never see the knife and the victim in the same frame, and the blood is in black-and-white.  I saw the first re-release in 1969, about 2 weeks before the first night I ever spent alone in a motel... and you can bet I didn't take a shower!

B00003CXCK|5.0|Schindler's List<br />Though you see Oscar Schindler in most of this film's scenes, he<BR>is primarily the narrator of this story, because the film is less <BR>about him than it is about triumph of the human spirit and survi-<BR>ving at a time when survival wasn't even one of the options.<BR>He is portrayed by Neeson as cold and calculating, motivated <BR>only by the expectation of windfall profits, but as the film unfolds, <BR>the viewer witnesses his uneasy transition to that of a man<BR>haunted by the horrors of mindless genocide. In the film's most <BR>poignant moment, Oscar witnesses the obliteration of the Warsaw <BR>ghetto through the eyes of one little girl, desparately seeking <BR>a way out--but finding none. It is in this moment that WE see <BR>all too clearly the single-minded ruthlessness with which the <BR>Nazis' pursued the complete extermination of European jews. <BR>And what we discovered in this cinematic journey is that Oscar <BR>Schindler was a man who failed at every thing he ever tried to <BR>accomplish, except for the ONE thing he was truly meant to do.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I think that it is simply AMAZING that the Beatles can make a best selling album to a new generation.  I have really enjoyed listening to this CD simply because it's the Beatles!  This compiles the best of their well-known songs onto one MEGA album.  &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; is my favorite, if you really really wanted to know.  Of course, there are a few of those classic jewels that were not number one hits, so they are not on this CD.  It certainly does not deserve to be called their greatest hits album, although it is in sort of the same genre, because there are a few good songs missing.  It blows me away to think that one band could have 27 number one hits!  That's really awesome!  If you like the Beatles, or if you just like classic rock, or if you're just spontaneously reading this review, I highly recommend that you purchase this album right away!
B00002JV0I|5.0|I became a fan along with a friend a while back while searching through my brother's CD case. We found this, thought it looked cool, so we popped it in my boombox. The only black metal we knew of back then were Emperor, but we loved them to death, so obviously we enjoyed 'At...' This album was a major push into the world of black metal for my friend and I. I now own a multitude of black metal albums, yet this still seems to be one of my favorites. Also, its the only Immortal CD other than 'Sons..' than I can find! I find it incredible how these songs can be quite repetitive and still I can listen to each second of every song. I believe its because of the incredible atmosphere that was created with this album. I mean just listen to the all out beauty of Solarfall. The crunchy cold guitar riff, coupled with the distorted bass, gargled vocals, and insane drumming create a winterland of metal. Its really hard to explain, so please, do yourself a favor and check this one out!<BR>The Band-<BR>Abbath, guitars, bass, synthesizers, and vocals- I give Abbath incredible credit for being able to pick up guitar and synth duites as well as bass. Demonaz caught some sort of illness sadly that restrained him from playing the guitar. He still writes lyrics for Immortal though. I believe with this album Immortal found an incredible style of their own, since Abbath creates most of the material written nowadays. I am glad more clean guitar is being incorporated with Immortal's music. Abbath also creates some very cool keyboard lines as well, like those on Solarfall and the title track. Hail Abbath!<BR>Horgh, drums and percussion- Horgh is one of the standouts of this album. His drumming isn't as fast as it is on 'Sons..', but it still fits the music perfectly and adds even more to that atmosphere I've been talking about. His percussive drums sound pretty cool too. <BR> <BR>At The Heart of Winter is a perfect addition to any black metal collection, and probably should be in everyone's.Plus, it's a great starter CD for new black metal fan, because it isn't an all out attack on the senses, which many black metal bands try to do.
B000001F5A|4.0|I like the theme music, which repeats itself throughout the various tracks. It sounds very much like Antarctica. However, I only find myself listening to a few tracks. Track 4 has a little over 2 minutes of solo reed instrument, which sounds like movie music as it doesn't create any atmosphere like the other tracks do. It then repeats track 1 after the reed solo and fades away after a few minutes, which seems kind of strange. I've never known Vangelis to do reprises. Other tracks like five just don't recapture the vastness and escapement that tracks 1 and 2 create. However, if you're wondering whether to buy it, I'll say that some of the tracks are wonderful enough that I wouldn't pass them up given another chance.
B000000H40|5.0|I must admit when I bought this album, I expected full-on super fast death, Cannibal Corpse-style. But when I popped it in, I got some nice slow, dirty, shredding technical death! Quite a good surprise, not that Cannibal Corpse don't kick arse or anything. Anywho, this album rules from start to finish, speeding up at the right times and slowing down at the right times. The production is alright to, now that its remastered. This is old school death at its best!<BR>The Band-<BR>John Tardy, vocals- John has quite a unique style, kinda reminiscent of early death. It sure fits the music though. Jonh's lyrics are pretty unintelligent, but hey, thre fun and cool, especially for that time period when death metal was just beggining.<BR>Trevor Peres, rhythm guitar- Trevor is responsible for co-writing every single riff on this album, which means he wrote all the classics, like Body Bag, Chopped in Half, and Turned Inside Out. Trevor has been with the band since the beggining I believe, and stuck with Obituary til' the end, which in my book is very cool when your band keeps losing members.<BR>James Murphy, lead guitar- When I said Trevor wrote most of the material on the album, that might sound a little selfish. But, Trevor doesn't write or play one solo on this album; Murphy does! And no one else could fit the part of lead guitarist for this album better than James. His style fit the band completely. A neat fact is that this was one of the first CDs Murphy played on; incredibly impressive for such a newbie, ins't it?<BR>Frank Watkins, bass- Not a lot of Frank's bass work is phenomonal, but he sure is heavy. And that to remasters, Frank's that much heavier. <BR>Donald Tardy, drums- Don pounds out some very cool bets on this one. I would say he's fast, but not as fast as other death metal drummers. Thankfully, on this album he doesn't have to be. His snare, toms, and cymbals are really what help Don out on this album. Though his bass drums are pretty audible, his snare and cymbals sound very crisp thanks to remeasters again.<br />A very cool death metal album for old school fans or for fans who are looking for something more technical than fast. Cheers, Obituary!
B000002IZM|5.0|Wow. This CD was great. Not only did it have catchy tunes from the movie that I liked, but it also surprised me with songs that weren't in the movie that have now grown on me. Others have expressed their dislike of the movie dialogue, but I have a different point of view. I pretty much like it because I've seen the movie, and it adds that verisimilitude when I listen to it. I do see where they're coming from, however, and the only thing I would change is to remove the minute of dialogue from the beginning of track 1.<br />\\"Wait for me\\" was a pleasant surprise for me, as I'm a fan of Enigma and it reminded me of it. As an added touch it has breathing in the beginning. Overall it's my favorite track. The \\"love theme\\" was perfect. When I first bought the CD, I was afraid it would have dialogue but it's completely instrumental. \\"Memories of green\\" had good production but in my opinion the sound effects in the background were a hair too loud. \\"One more kiss, dear\\" is a simple, yet very lovely song done in a 1950/60's style. \\"Blush response\\" and \\"Rachel's Song\\" are new songs not featured in the movie, but remind me of the movie anyway.<br />If you managed to read this far you must be seriously considering this CD... wait no longer! Buy it now, you won't be disappointed!!!!!
B00000HYXB|5.0|Power metal is played to the absolute max on this incredible Blind Guardian release. Though this is my first BG I have purchased, I have listened to them online for quite awhile. Rhythm and lead guitar work on this album are incredible, drumming is excuted perfectly, heavy bass supports the pounding drums, cool keyboard effects fill every song, and sweet vocal harmonies intertwine every second of this hour and five minutes of bliss. Of course, to the average metal head this could be cheesy, but when taken in musical seriousness, there's no denying this album is awesome.<BR>The Band-<BR>Hansi Kursch, lead and backing vocals- Hansi is now one of my favorite power metal vocalists. Though many power metal vocalists sound familiar, Hansi really does have a style of his own. And being backed by an awesome choir doesn't hurt either.<BR>Andre Olbrich, lead and acoustic guitars- Although Andre hogs much of the writing on this album, he still is a brilliant guitarist. Just check out his solos on Into the Storm, Blood Tears, Nightfall, and Thorn. Not to mention his beautiful acoustic bits, though I haven't found a nice acoustic song in full yet.<BR>Marcus Siepen, rhythm guitars- Sadly, we don't get to see a lot of guitar work written by Marcus on this album, although he does write one of my favorite songs on the album, The Curse of Feanor. I am glad that BG do have a permanent rhythm guitarist though, since these songs live would sound pretty bad with just one guitar.<BR>Thomas Stauch, drums and percussion- Tom has some great beats here and there, but what really impresses me is his wide arrange of percussive instruments. Since this is an album based on the novel by the great J.R.R. Tolkien ('The Silmarillion', if you don't already know), it is nice to hear some fantasy-like instruments that add to the mood.<br />All in all, this is a perfect CD for a begginer in the genre of power metal and for those exploring the genre. Everything on this album is just about perfect, even though the production in some places is kind of sterile.
B000053GTK|5.0|This album is simply all that prog-rock is about but still it hasnt got one cliche on it. This is truly PROGRESSIVE, not just rock songs spiced with occasional 7/8-parts. Just get it. If you love progressive rock, you love Gentle Giant.
B0000009TK|5.0|I am writing this in favor of every live Zappa album there is.  I personally love Frank and grab up everything I can.  Put on a pair of headphones listen to this album and I defy you to find any other rock group that comes anywhere close to the complexity of what Frank did live.  99% of what other groups do are rehashes of studio work mostly of inferior quality, but it is live.  The absolute confidence and skill Frank and his &quot;real musicians&quot; accomplished in live performance puts the vast majority to shame.  Frank passing was a great loss to the musical community, rock, jazz and classical venues alike.
B000001FW9|5.0|I still remember the day I bought this album. I didnt know anything else about Gentle Giant but they were a prog-band. When I got home, I put my headphones on and pressed the &quot;play&quot;-button. Suddenly I was somewhere else. The song &quot;Pantagruels Nativity&quot; sends Me into a world that could be from J.R.R.Tolkiens mind. This song is just unbelieveable, one of the best prog-rock songs ever made! The next track, &quot;Edge of twilight&quot;, is a surreal trip to a nighttime-sleeping village, or thats where my mind always travels when I listen to this song. Couple of next songs are just perfect too. &quot;The moon is down&quot; is also one of my favourites. Kind of short, but it still has a lot of stuff in it. I really like the way the song &quot;Black cat&quot; sounds after listening to &quot;The moon is down&quot;. After &quot;black cat&quot; I Always feel like the album is over, but theres still &quot;plain truth&quot; to come. Its also a great song, but not one of my favourites. This is an album any prog-head should have! Gentle Giant really didnt make another album like this, but you might also like their other albums as well. My recommedations: In a Glass House, Power and The Glory, Three Friends. This is some of the best music known to man! Get these albums, Now!
B00006F7S4|1.0|This album was utterly disappointing. I've been a Beck fan for about 12 years and it has taken that much time for me to become disillusioned but \\"Sea Change\\" has done it. The critics were right about the heartbreak at least: this record is so bad it's heartbreaking. He relys heavily on trite cliches to mope his way through dull, unevocative, just-plain-bad songwriting... I was really looking forward to this record. \\"One Foot in the Grave\\" has been one of my favorite albums since it's release. I'm also a fan of \\"Stereopathetic...\\" and \\"Mellow Gold\\". But this collection of songs sheds such a light on the nature of his artistry that it actually makes his past releases worse.
B00004YZ36|5.0|This cycle stands among the greatest of Mozart Piano Concertos.  Compared to the complete cycle recorded by Vladimir Ashkenazy (my point of reference), this set possesses great qualities, in both the music making and the recording quality.  Deutsche Grammphon has done a superb job of remastering these recordings.  Some passages have a bit of glare in the string section, though this is not pervasive and is perhaps the only real hint as to the age of these recordings (made between 1961 and 1969).<br />Published reviews of these recordings by Geza Anda mention that he set the stage for &quot;modern&quot; interpretations of these piano concertos.  I concur strongly with this evaluation.  After hearing other great renditions of these works by Ashkenazy, Barenboim (1960s and 1990s), Brendel, and Uchida, (I have not heard any concertos by Murray Perahia), I believe one will find unique and inspiring approaches to these works by Geza Anda.  <br />This is a thoroughly recommendable and economical collection of these concertos.  Though I would still slightly favor the complete set by Vladimir Ashkenazy because it includes the concertos for two and three pianos, whereas this set only includes the single-piano concertos.  However, for the listener who wishes to possess another complete cycle of the concertos, then this set stands strongly on its own merits.
B000002AGN|5.0|There's a reason &quot;Time Out&quot; has sold gazillions of copies over the past 43 years. It is not just really, really good, but it does have a bit of an edginess...Brubeck and his saxophonist Desmond combined to alter their rhythms just enough so that the listener has a few challenges, yet each selection ends up a pleasing experience for the ear and the brain. &quot;Take Five&quot; is justly famous, &quot;composed&quot; by Desmond and led by him, but the other numbers, while less memorable than that, are plenty good enough. There is a reason why the vast majority of the 87 reviews posted as of today advise that you add this to your collection. Read 10 or 20 of them and you'll get the picture on the cover of the album, as well as the CD inside, as quickly as you can find a way to pay for it. Hear it with earphones and no distractions a few times before you play it for your entire living room. Is it one of the ten best &quot;traditional jazz&quot; CD's out there, or only one of the 20 best? Opinions will differ, but few would ever rate it below the top twenty. All four members of the Quartet get shining moments within this 38 minutes of music.
0743238257|5.0|Unlike some reviewers, I feel that if I get one idea that will change my life from a book, that book has been well worth its cost. Peck's first book did just that. After a lapse of many years, I started writing again, my health improved and yes, I attribute that to Peck's first &quot;Road Less Traveled.&quot;<br />I don't know how this second one will affect my next decade for I haven't yet walked down that road.  I expect that it will make some major difference for me. I suppose it might for anyone who reads it with a willing spirit.<br />One of the things I learned from Peck is to consciously be open to new ideas or to refamiliarizing oneself with good, old ones. Being quick to find fault is often nothing more than a defense of old practices that may allow us to protect ourselves so that we feel oh, so comfortable. Growing pains are sometimes preferable to warm fuzzies.<br />Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of \\"This is the Place\\"
B000066NW0|4.0|When i heard \\"complicated\\" i diddent like it until i heard the album its is really good!!<BR>her voice is poewerfull and different and the music is superb almost like the go-gos meet alanis morrisette! <BR>the worst track skater boy is cheesy but the rest is excellent <BR>buy it and see!!
B000000H3Z|5.0|How do you begin to describe an indescribable experience? In one almighty slab of a metal landmark, Sepultura created the near perfect thrash album. Thick, aggressive guitars, gargantuan drums, the perfect mix of all things metal.<br />1989 was a landmark year for thrash metal. A generation of Metalli-clones was dominating the scene, and death metal was just starting to rear its pustulant head. Thrash was on the verge of being written off. Suddenly, a typhoon of immense proportions swept out of the over crowded slums of Brazil. The impact \\"Beneath The Remains\\" made on the metal world is near on impossible to comprehend now, but it was like a force 12 hurricane on the Beaufort scale, a magnitude 10 earthquake on the Richter scale, a huge asteroid crashing into the Earth. OK, so it was only one album, and there were probably about five billion people in the world who had never heard of Sepultura, but in terms of metal, it was really big!<br />It may seem hard to believe, but this one album revitalised faith in thrash to still deliver killer albums. Harnessing the power of Slayer, the muscle of Metallica at their peak, the aggression of hardcore, and touches of many other influences from Black Sabbath to Celtic Frost to Dead Kennedys, Sepultura seemed to have hit upon the perfect recipe to take metal into the 1990s. This took Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" to the next level. <br />All still in their teens when the album was recorded, it was amazing to hear such maturity from such an unexpected source. Brazil had produced a grand total of zero metal bands of international note before Sepultura. While English was only a second language to a young Max Cavalera, he showed excellent mastery of dark themes, while keeping things relatively simple and to the point. The lyric sheet is not really good reading if you're looking for something to cheer you up. His rhythm guitar playing is also outstanding. Andreas Kisser's leads were original for a time when lead guitar players were either ripping off Kerry King or Kirk Hammett. Igor Cavalera's drumming is incredibly accurate and aggressive. Paolo's bass is not really audible for much of the album, but it provides a rock solid sub-sonic foundation for the whirlwind of noise created above. <br />Slipping on this album is like meeting an old friend after spending months surrounded by people you can't stand. Every track has its distinctive familiar character, instantly recognisable when you hear it. The acoustic introduction to the title track, the solos on \\"Sarcastic Existence\\", the opening riff on \\"Slaves Of Pain\\", Max shouting \\"Mass Hypnosis\\". All provide metallic nirvana, a veritable musical orgasm, a feast of sonic pleasure.<br />Yep, when the rest of the world has gone crazy, \\"Beneath The Remains\\" is still there, like a thrash metal security blanket.
6302765536|2.0|They tried the same formula but it did not have the charm, warmth, or laughs of the first film. This time they even threw in a homeless woman to try and capitalize on America's fascination and empathy for homeless people. It didn't work. The homeless woman character seemed to be full of all sorts of wisdom and brilliance. She was also some kind of \\"bird lady\\" who fed pigeons in the park and was almost entirely covered by bird feces. Too bad she didn't use her profound sense of wisdom to understand that being covered in bird poop is unhealthy and disgusting.<br />Donald Trump makes a cameo in the film and at that point you wonder it was probably done just so they could get a good rate on filming at the Plaza Hotel which Trump owns. Otherwise, why would you include this talentless, buffoon into anything?<br />Joe Pesci and what's-his-name show up again and just happen to run into \\"the kid\\", as my daughter refers to him, on the street. Once again, \\"the kid\\" feels the need to defend his turf, this time his turf is the Big Apple, and he devises an elaborate plan to outwit these two morons. Haven't they learned anything by now? <br />Anyway, the only plus to this film is the irresistable Culkin and the opportunity to see the cast assemble once again. Otherwise, the storyline, especially the parts involving Tim Curry, are just mind-numbingly stupid. But, hey, my daughter enjoys it so what do I care? But, I think she likes \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Home Alone 3\\" better.
B000002JR8|2.0|This album is considered a minor classic. Can someone explain why?<br />The riffs are excellent, the drumming intense, the vocals brutal. Problem is, Pantera forgot to write any songs. Most of this album is just a few riffs thrown together at random, the odd sub-Death Metal growl over things, continue for four or five minutes, then do it again. Most of this album is \\"brutal for brutal's sake\\", and forget playing music.<br />Case in point, \\"Becoming\\". There is just no flow to the song whatsoever, sounding like someone with Attention Deficit Disorder put it together. Vinnie Paul has the strangest kickdrum sound this side of an old Dismember album. Dimebag's riffs do not run into each other. Phil Anselmo growls monotonously. Rex's bass is there somewhere, and it just gets frustrating, because it should be better.<br />Dimebag Darrell's guitars are the high point of the album, and also a disappointment. He's a one of a kind player, but seemed intent in showing off. The guitar sound has a killer, crunching tone to it, but almost every song featured a clipped, almost staccato riff in it somewhere.<br />Phil Anselmo must be one of the worst singers in metal. He has the vocal range of a rutting stag. His vocals are one dimensional, and many of the lyrics incredibly juvenile. `Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills' has to be a contender for one of the worst songs to ever make it to record, so inane are the lyrics.<br />There are none of the classic headbangers on this album, like \\"F***ing Hostile\\" or \\"Primal Concrete Sledge\\" or \\"Domination\\". `Vulgar Display Of Power' suffered a little of the disjointed song writing too, yet the other albums either side of this pair are excellent.<br />Pantera seemed to be doing everything they could to distance themselves their early career `Glamtera' days by being as brutal as possible. They were also trying to distance themselves from the days when they were compared to Metallica. So they copied Exhorder's sound instead, note perfect but without the songs to back it up. Exhorder's albums sell second hand for many times the original price. `Far Beyond Driven' turns up in the bargain bin.<br />This is simply just not good music.
B000066F6H|5.0|The Hives have been getting a lot of media attention recently in part because of the string of bands that everyone keeps grouping together (The Hives,The Vines,The Strokes).<BR>Besides the ever-present 'The', each band has their own sound.The Hives use a lot of sharp guitar sounds that blend perfectly with Pelle Almquist's (lead vocals) cracking voice.<BR>This is the type of music that you can't sit still to. There's only one slow song on the entire album (Find Another Girl) and even that rocks. They remind me of the Ramones (though they are of course incomparable, The Ramones that is) but never the less the music and anthem-esque songs (my own personal anthem being Main Offender) make me want to listen to The Ramones.<BR>I was at first turned off by them because of the hype and the cult like concerts (in which Pelle seems to want everyone to worship the band) but now I'm checking for thjey're next show.
B0000248L1|5.0|Uh oh, what's this? A dodgy thrash album? Well, it has all the trimmings to set off the average detector- a logo which looks like it's stolen from Blade Runner, five bemulleted denim-clad warriors trying to look tough on the back, a pretty girl being stalked by a demonic dolly on the front. This should really set alarm bells ringing. It almost makes Anthrax's 'Fistful Of Metal' look classy.<br />But never judge a book, or an album, by it's cover. The grooves within contain pure class.<br />The pretty intro piece \\"Crystal Ann\\" is a well executed classical guitar passage, merely whetting the appetite for some thrash action. And thrash this does! \\"Alison Hell\\" sets the standard for the rest of the album to follow. There are tasty guitar licks by the truckload. Annihilator main man and guitar slinger Jeff Waters wrote just about everything on the album, played all the guitars and bass, and threw in some backing vocals. Lead vocalist Randy Rampage (as if THAT was his real name...) looks like he'd just escaped from the introductory class at the Motley Crue School of Big Hair and Bad Makeup, but when the guy opens his mouth, the hair crimes are forgiven. Limited vocals were often a stumbling point for thrash outfits, but Rampage lets rip with a gutsy, tuneful shout reminiscent of a more restrained version of Overkill's Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth<br />The recording of the album took over a year, as it was done a small piece at a time, but there is excellent flow throughout, with no sense of anything being disjointed.<br />The music is second to none when it comes to riffs and solos. OK, so it's more polished than the likes of Slayer or Possessed, but both of those bands would have cleaned up their sound if they could have written melodies and solos like Waters. There is something new to discover on almost every listen, with the odd thing still hitting the ear more than a decade after first hearing it- a quick fill here, an unnoticed counter-melody there. However, it's not Malmsteen-esque guitar wankery. These are songs which will have you playing air guitar and compulsively banging your head, so be careful listening to it while using public transport if you don't want to attract funny looks.<br />Waters' lyrical bent was rather refreshing for the time. Each song has a quick explanatory note with the lyrics. He explored themes of mental illness and altered states of mind ('Schizos Are Never Alone Part I & II', 'Human Insecticide', 'Alison Hell', 'Word Salad'), and even literature, with a retelling of Edgar Allen Poe's twisted supernatural story of love lost and found in 'Ligeia'. On any normal album, 'Ligeia' would be a contender for the best track on the album. It has an addictive crushing main riff, excellent guitar and bass interplay in the bridge section, intelligent, thoughtful lyrics, solos to die for, and a driving thrash pace to get even the most jaded toes tapping.<br />But this isn't any normal album. Last track off the ranks is the storming 'Human Insecticide'. It pushes the standard just that bit further. It rips straight into the main riff, a high-speed thrash classic- simple, memorable and irresistible for the air guitar enthusiast. Rampage puts in his most er, rampaging performance of the album, spitting out the lyrics as if he were the delusional psychotic subject of the song. Blasting out of first one speaker, then the other, then both, the fretboard frenzy seems to pick up speed as the song progresses. It thrashes it's way through several themes of the original concept, continuing to gain momentum until it all collapses in an exhausted, satisfied mess, like a slow motion train crash in a 1970s disaster movie.<br />Jeff Waters set the standard so high for himself with this stunning debut he has never even remotely approached such greatness again.steen-esque guitar wankery.

B00005JA2B|5.0|...(CARRY ON WAYWARD SON) screamed out of the speakers, WOW I was held in awe, then (THE WALL) my first spiritual encounter at the age of 14, WHATS ON MY MIND \\"they rock\\" I thought \\"like BOSTON do\\" (MIRACLES OUT OF NO WHERE), the most progressive music I had ever heard ,but the best was yet to come, (CHEYENNE ANTHEM), so beautiful so well writen and of course the mighty (MAGNUM OPUS) I was in a musical heaven. I was so impressed with this, that night I took the album to bed to read every bit of fine print on the cover and look at the picture of that bearded wise man on the cover,...Its a long time since my first encounter with LEFTOVERTURE but I remember It like It was yesterday.If you havent heard this brilliant works of art please do so it magical.
0385486804|5.0|I loved this book! I enjoyed and had a great learning experience about the wilderness up North. Very Interessting and exciting! I wish i could do the same thing as Chris someday
0380817683|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I've read it three times!  I found it to be a very true-to-life story of an addict coming to understand herself and break free of her addiction.  Rachel is a very likeable, very human character, and her journey to a better life is at times hilarious and at times heart-wrenching.   In my opinion, this is the best of Marian Keyes' books.
B000065V3H|5.0|if you're an 80's child like me, you need to get this one! It's up there with all of the John Hughes classics, and until now, hasn't been available on DVD for a decent price. The soundtrack is great and the storyline typical 80's high school: popular kids and jocks vs the nerds and \\"losers\\". If you like Patrick Dempsey, catch him in the new hit \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" with Reese Witherspoon.
B000066NW0|5.0|Before I say anything else, I can bet you that all these people who r dissing avril haven't even heard her cd, and just don't like her image. Personally,I find it so annoying that she is being dissed cuz she isn't punk.Who ever told u people that she was punk?Where did all this come from and why r there all these people that are just CONVINCED that avril is punk.Well she's not,and she never said she is,so just STOP.now about her music, personaly,i LOVED IT!Now  I agree that her music is for the younger crowd, but that doesn't mean that it isn't meaningful or without feeling.That's not true.Avril has a good voice, and when she sings every word comes out with feeling. Her lyrics are also really,really good.They deal with a lot of the stuff that teenagers go through(being a teenager myself,I should know),but they are very well-written,and give the music itself even more meaning.Avril still needs to fully form as an artist, but this is still a WONDERFUL album.Most of the songs are feel-good and expressive.Here is a seperate review of each track.<BR>(i know, know im gettin' annoying)<br />1.Losing Grip-This is perfect for an opening track for some reason.The beginning is sort of icy and cool, but the chorus is very lud and roary.A good song with strong vocals,and an angry feel to it.<br />2.Complicated-Who hasn't heard this?For me,it STILL hasn't gotten old!<br />3. Sk8ter Boy-This is a poppy rock song with some punk influence. It's definately a cool song to sing along to.The lyrics here r definately un-serious, but that's the whole vibe this song is meant to have.It's not meant to be \\"deep\\".It's very fast.The fastest song on the whole cd.<br />4.Im With You-This is the slowest song on the cd.It's kind of a rock ballad.It is quite emotional, and her voice is shown the best on this cd.It's very powerful.LOVE IT!<br />5.Mobile-This is the worst song on the cd, which is fine cuz its still pretty good. It's just not really a standout among all the rest.<br />6.Unwanted-Thisis the most rock-influenced song on the whole cd.It's vibe is similar to losing grip,but it's angrier and I like it better.It's great for those times when no one understands.<br />7.Tomorrow-A soft song.It's very gentle and pretty.<br />8.Anything but Ordinary-This song has great lyrics,a good chorus, and from experience,this IS something that will get stuck in ur head.A great song!<br />9.Things I'll Never Say-A really feel-good song that'll make u wanna sing along.It has a very catchy chorus,and is a very cool song!<br />10.My World-Good lyrics that talk about duh,her world.It's similar to #9,but it's more poppy.I don't know how to describe this song,except that it's another one of those feel-good songs.honest and straight forward.<br />11.Nobody's Fool-Love this song!!She raps the first verses and it sounds cool.It has a great beat,is totally catchy. empowering.<br />12.Too Much To Ask-A great song.An awesome chorus.Probably her most grown-up work.Except I think she could've thought of something better to say in the first verse besides \\"I thought you were cool up until the point you didn't call\\".Other than that,it's awesome.<br />13.Naked-It's a good song.It is a bit on the mellow side, and is nice to relax to.<br />All in all,it's a great cd.She is talented and I respect her for writing her own music.On the most part,her music is catchy and melodic, but in some places,she shows many signs that she will grow into something deeper.But that aside, her music is totally relatable,her voice is good,and something I listen to A LOT!!(P.S.i saw her sing live somewhere, and she sounds even better than on her cd, so I don't understand why people r saying that she can't sing live)GET THIS!!!
0345298349|5.0|Arkydy Renko, an honest hard working, conscientious, public investigator, fights his way through a maze of evil and hostile characters, the cunning, ruthless American entrepreneur, Osborne, his own corrupt boss, Yamskoi and major Preblida, the KGB man. He is after the ruthless killer of three young people, found in frozen Gorky Park, shot at point- blank- range, their faces and fingertips obliterated.. He is helped along the way by the brother of one of the slain men, a young American idealist. Curwell, a New York detective, fluent in Russian, joins hands reluctantly with Arkydy to revenge his brother's murder.<br />Arkydy, by brilliant reasoning and with help from his love, Arina Ossinova, entangles the Sable fur trade, the labyrinth of KGB, and bureaucracy of FBI, tracks down the killer all the way to New York City. Here detective Curwell teams up with him to go after Osborne. But Osborne knows the score and book ends with an unforgettable scene where Arkydy fulfilling his task, limps back to Moscow. He tells Arina, his accomplice and love,who sells her very soul to come to America, to go disappear in America, where she belongs.<br />The book sheds light on dark, Byzantine, bad old days of Soviet Union where every body spied on every body and KGB ruled supreme. I guess people<br />like Arkydy, the optimistic, very human chief investigator, turned the Soviet r&eacute;gime around and created another revolution seventy years after the brutal first, paving the way for democracy.
0375704027|5.0|This novel was a huge depature from Murakami's other work. Unlike his other works, which are chalk full of evil sheep, unicorns, wind up birds, and the end of the world, Norwegian Wood is a fairly straight forward coming of age love story. But the relativly simplistic plot of this novel betrays a very complex underworking that is just as good, if not better, then the other, more playful and bizarre, books. In terms of actual style, I couldn't help but liken it to a mixture of The Great Gatasby and Catcher in the Rye (bot of which are alluded too many times in the course of Norwegian Wood). Unlike the other Murakami's, which I feel have an almost emotional void to them (which I love, don't get me wrong...), this one was almost painfully emotional. Loce, loss, hardship, happiness; Murakami touches on all of them. And Toru Watanabe is not the average Murakami Hero. AGain, he is more emotional, less detached then the others. The reader knows him far better than any of the other protagonists in the other novels. You feel for him. You understand the basis of his pain. It's really a powerful novel. Any Murakami fan that hasn't yet read this, must get to it as soon as poissible. Don't overlook it because it appears to be mainstream (which it really isn't). However...if you are looking for a Murakami book to start with, I really can't recommend this one, simply because it is so much more different than the other books. Try the Wind-up Chronicle or A Wild Sheep Chase. And have fun. Reading Murakami for the first time is on e of the greatest experiences you can have.
6305508550|5.0|This movie is a classic.  Mike Judge, the man who brought the world &quot;Beavis and Butthead,&quot; surprizingly brings us an increadibly clever, fun, and a &quot;God I wish I could do that&quot; movie.  Every one who has ever worked in an office will see this movie as the gospell.  People can associate with every character in the film.  Ron Livingston, also a bit part in &quot;Swingers&quot; was a wonderful lead.  He plays the &quot;stand up and fight the man&quot; role to perfection. Well done, fun, and a must have in any DVD collection.  Well worth the money, and something you'll watch over and over and laugh each time.
B000002L7J|5.0|On the second proper LP from the Smiths, Morrissey makes no attempt to conceal his disdain for carnivores on the chilling title track.  Dramatic and over-the-top, it takes vegetarianism to fanatic heights.  Once you've read the lyrics, you'll be sorry you ever made that drive-through at McDonald's.  Elsewhere, Morrissey and Marr create strokes of brilliance on \\"Meat is Murder.\\"  Here, the singer glides through unrequited love (\\"I Want the One I Can't Have\\"), isolation (\\"How Soon is Now,\\" which appears on the American version), and child abuse (\\"Barbarism Begins at Home\\").  Nobody does self-pity like Morrissey.  Sample lyric: \\"when I lay in bed at night/ I think about death and I think about life/ and neither one/ particularly appeals to me.\\"  And Johny Marr's melodies are always strong and on-point, adding urgency to Morrissey's thoughtful and eloquent lyrics.  Morrissey cries, \\"That joke isn't funny anymore.\\"  But we're not laughing.  \\"Meat is Murder\\" is a blazingly good album that's just one of the few entries in the band's stellar catalog of brilliant British pop.
B000006TRV|5.0|Roger Waters steals the show in one of the finest hours in rock with 'The Wall'. From the opening chord to the last, it is one of the most awesome journeys any music fan could have.  Certain parts are dull and very depressing, but the album has a way of pulling you in and not letting you out.  Floyd took a departure from their long-song routine and made a series of shorter songs into a narrative.  What we get are some of the most powerful, moving, mind-blowing songs in rock history; 'In the Flesh', 'Another Brick in the Wall Pt.2', 'Goodby Blue Sky', 'Rull Like Hell', 'Mother', 'Hey You' and 'Comfortably Numb'.  Never has there been a rock band who made such great songs just on one album.
B00005QGAX|3.0|Michael Jackson faced the most daunting task any recording artist could tackle: following up the greatest-selling album of all time.  \\"Bad\\" is an all-too-obvious example of what happens when you try too hard to top yourself.  His first album in 5 years, the CD has some really good songs sandwiched in between cheesy material.  There's no denying the soul and power of \\"Man in the Mirror,\\" a far more convincing inspirational song than the bloated mess that is \\"Heal the World.\\"  The excellent \\"Smooth Criminal\\" radiates with unfiltered energy and urgency, while \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is a bouncy, if fluffy, love song with a killer chorus.  Elsewhere, it's a one-way trip to Velveeta-land.  Michael's duet with Siedah Garret, \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is so syrupy, it looks better on a mile-high stack of waffles.  The song is extremely sappy.  When he warned, \\"your butt is mine\\" on the tepid title track, I was holding back bursts of laughter.  C'mon, Jacko.  We know you as a lover, not a fighter.  You said it yourself.  And his duet with Stevie, \\"Just Good Friends\\" is just forgettable.  Had this CD been released by someone else, it wouldn't have debuted at No. 1 and spawned five Number One singles as it did.  While I wasn't looking for a sequel to \\"Thriller,\\" \\"Bad\\" is just a few pints short of the greatness I expected.
B000002U9W|2.0|No doubt, Pink Floyd is/was one of the greatest rock bands, but the stuff they made before 'Dark Side..' is either extremely strange of just plain boring.  'Atom Heart Mother' is just plain boring.  The title track grows on you after repeated listenings; it contains something new each time that you hadn't heard before, but the rest of the album is bad.  The songs have no light or heart.  I like the cover.  Its kind of funny.
B00005MNP7|5.0|Yes, this album is the definitive Blondie and does hold its own against the great albums of all time. It rocks ragingly. 'Nuff said.
B000002U8G|3.0|After the disaster that was 'Atom Heart Mother', Pink Floyd released 'Meddle', an album signaling the beginning of their greatness.  It is not without is major flaws.  The first half is incredibly boring, with only one good song.  I forget  which one, but it goes something like &quot;born with a silver spoon in your mouth&quot;.  The second half is just plain magical.<br />'Echoes' is one of the greatest longest songs I've heard.  It is constructed with simplicity and played beautifully.  There is a long section where no music is played, but then from the darkness, the instruments the intruments reappear, and what you hear will be nothing but pure magic.
B000002INR|5.0|If you don't like this album, then you don't like rock n' roll, plain and simple.  I still have tapes from this album and \\"Slave to the Grind\\", which has the greatest song ever - 'Wasted Time'.<br />These guys kicked ..., the singer is great, the guitarist is bluesy and these are just some regular guys in a band, no make-up or hair spray.  These guys bring it from the street. I listen to all kinds of music, but this band never goes away, how can you deny your roots??? I loved it when i was 10 and i love it now when i'm 23!!!!!!!!! Skid Row fu*%in' Rules, Man!!!!!!
0380977788|4.0|Coraline is bored. Her parents work more than she'd like them too, her clothes are dull, her new home is boring, and the neighbors, though interesting, aren't entertaining enough to hold her interest for long. Eventually she finds her way through a bricked-over doorway into a new world. She meets her kind-but-creepy \\"Other Parents,\\" enjoys a delicious meal, talks with cats and rats, and plays with new, marvelous toys. Still, she decides to go back to her real parents and her real life. Her \\"Other Mother,\\" however, has different plans for Coraline.<br />Coraline is a fun and haunting read. I particularly enjoyed the character of Coraline herself - she lacks the supreme self-possession displayed by the protagonists of many other children's books. Sometimes she's a very brave little girl, and at other times she's just a little girl, preoccupied with neon green gloves and boots shaped like frogs.<br />The book has some genuinely creepy moments in it, and may be too scary for younger children. The \\"Other Mother\\" in particular, as she increasingly reveals her true self, can be quite frightening. The disconcerting prospect of having buttons sewn on where one's eyes used to be is another unpleasantness that lingered in my mind's eye long after I'd finished the book.
0380778556|4.0|Rebecca is an amazing book. It took me awhile to get into thought, but after a few chapters, I couldn't put it down!
B00006G8G1|5.0|Okay... I want to add my $0.02 on Rock In Rio. Fully tainted by \\"being a fan\\".<br />First, it absolutely must be said: MAIDEN ROCKS!<br />Second, details... People commented on Steve Harris's video direction, on it being so jumpy it'll cause seizures (or something to that effect). After watching it in it's entirety, I must say it's NOT SO!<br />It is a bit \\"busy\\" at times... with one notable \\"drumming on the editing board\\" moment during \\"Wrathchild\\". Otherwise, I liked most of the video edit - usually it followed where the action was, and with 6 guys in the band, that's tough to keep up with.<br />But, even if you have simply have to turn off the video... GET IT FOR THE AUDIO ANYWAY!!! The performances by every member are the best I've witnessed. Bruce sang better than I've ever heard him live. Steve rocked. Janick rocked. Adrian, rocked. Dave and Nicko... well, I would have to say, \\"rocked\\" also. :)<br />Why, it's as if they KNEW they were being RECORDED! :)<br />More plusses: Easter Eggs (including \\"Monkeys In Love\\"), interview snippets, photos.<br />Downside: Yes, there is a fault to this, and it's part of it's strength. It's the 5.1 audio.<br />Anyone reading up on RIR knows this disc was designed for 5.1 ONLY. On most players (including mine), the stereo downsample will cut a guitarist out completely (on mine, Janick). Find a friend with a 5.1 audio system, and you're good to go - I might just get me one. :)
0316666343|5.0|I had read a review of this book, was intrigued by the description, and bought it as soon as I could.  I literally could not put it down.  If you have children you cannot help but identify with this family and what it is going through.  Everything is written through the eyes of the young girl who was murdered and she watches her family go through all the stages of grief.  She watches them deny, grieve, fall apart as a family, and eventually go on with their lives.  Even though Susie has to deal with the fact that she will never be older than 14, that she will never have a relationship, that she will never touch or be a part of her family again, by the end of the book she has reached a mature attitude for beyond her years.  The author's description of heaven is the way you would hope it would be.  If you want a good book to curl up with, not an intellectual read, a book where you can identify with and become close to the characters, while enjoying a writer who tells the story from a completely different perspective than what you are used to, this would be the book!
0767020308|4.0|Being that I have never read the book &quot;Emma&quot;...I cannot say if this film lives up to the standards that I am led to believe of the novel. Regardless..I found this to be a very charming story.<BR>I adored the characters ...Mr Knightly was sooo gorgeous and Mrs Bates with her constant ramblings was a treat. I also found it fun to see Kate Beckinsdale before she became wildly famous.<BR>This was really a fun way to spend a few hours and I would definitely recommend it.
B00004NRWH|5.0|When I first heard Nickelback in the fall of 2000, I tought tey had a really great intense sound that I thought was fairly unique. I finally got the state recently. I have to admit, it's a strong rock album. I like it better than silver side up. It seems the state should have brought nickelback to the mainstream then silver side up. The songs on te state are intense and great to listen to. Both versions of leader of men are good. Other songs like breath and hold on your hand are also great. Overall, just a great straight ahead rock album.
B000002J1H|5.0|A great album, equal to their previous masterpieces.<br />I totally recomend it to newcomers or people exploring YES.<br />I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed Relayer,Fragile,Close to the Edge etc. Dont let harsh critics influence you.<br />The magical melodies, the outwordly feeling, the mystical lyrics, everything works in this album, a truly YES album.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|How any fan of this fantastic film can accept this HORRIBLE transfer is shocking.  The dvd supposedly contains not only the special edition but also the original theatrical edition, but the reality is that the mis-named \\"original theatrical\\" edition is a mutilated version that is definitely NOT the film shown in theaters in 1991.  The colors were drastically changed, making brown things red, red things pink, and erasing all shadows into virtual non-existence.      Gone is the palette of beautiful rich colors that were used when the film was made.  In their place we have a pastel, ... saturday-morning cartoon palette where shadows don't exist.  Instead of keeping the brooding, gothic, mysterious castle that once existed, the dvd lightened it up so there are no more mysterious shadows.  Now you can see everything quite clearly, including the Beast (when he was supposed to be lurking in shadows as a plot device).      The backgrounds were literally replaced with computer generated backgrounds for the imax presentation, which is fine for the special edition.  But they also used the new backgrounds for the supposed \\"original theatrical\\" version as well.  Oh, and did I mention that they went in with a computer to completely re-draw the characters to make them smoother?  They used those altered images for the so-called \\"original theatrical\\" version, too.  They also cut off the top and the bottom of the film to make the aspect ratio 1.85:1, when the original film was made in 1.66:1 (much closer to your actual \\"regular\\" tv shape).  Add those changes to the edited dialogue (there is no more stuttering Beast) and the horrid pastel colors that replaced the vibrant colors that used to be, and you have one big mess.  ... - what Disney calls the \\"original theatrical\\" version is just the special edition without the human again sequence.      ...
0385501560|3.0|It's not that Chuck Palahniuk is overated. He deserves some, if not all the attention that he's been getting for being a truly inventive and amusing author. The problem seems to be that his books are never quite capable of pulling off a genuine interest and concern for the misled and troubled characters. Palahniuk's skewed view of the world his books take place in adds enormously to their cynical humor and biting sarcasm, but effectively keeps us from viewing the characters as basically good people, or even as true humans. This problem kept me from ever really enjoying the truly original ideas and complicated subplots.<br />In Choke, Victor Mancini is a sex-aholic who supports himmself and his hospitalized mother by going to resteraunts and pretending to choke on a piece of food until someone 'rescues' him. His theory is that once a person saves your life, they feel responsible for it forever. As in all of Palahniuk's books, multiple plot lines that seem unrelated pop up constantly, revealing facts about Victor's childhood with his sociopahtic mother, his day job at a colonial reenactment village, his best friend and fellow sex-addict, and a doctor at his mother's hospital. These all tie in to the ending, which was personally a let down to me considering some of the other great endings his books have had.<br />Choke has all the outward makings of a good book, but it lacks emotional depth and human interest, which prove vital in the end.
B00005Q4GV|5.0|PATTON opens with George C Scott's famed six minute monologue as  General George S Patton addressing troops. This segment alone is enough to convince viewers that Scott deserved his Oscar- even if he himself didn't want it. He gives a superlative performance as the hard-assed and fearless General who is the only US General truly feared by the Nazis: Ironic considering Patton  had his nose shot off by the Germans. The man thinks nothing of shooting fatigued pack horses and dumping them into a river because they no longer serve their purpose to him. But although he is referred to by his men as \\"old blood-and-guts\\" (\\"Our blood, his guts\\") Patton still manages to hide an almost fatherly love towards them (the scene where Patton tends a wounded soldier in hospital and then reverts to his hard-nose self and begins beating up on the poor guy for being a coward. And later in fearless mode to one of his superiors \\"I shaved very close this morning, in preparation of getting smacked by you\\".<BR>The battle sequences are well staged. In fact not a single frame of PATTON's 2 1/2 hours that doesn't detract the viewer's interest. If high school history had been this interesting, maybe I would have passed.<BR>My only complaints with the movie: What's with the stupid intermission two-thirds of the way through the film? And second, it seems Jerry Goldsmith later recycled a portion of his score for the POLICE ACADEMY movies. Now if that isn't an insult to cinema history, then what is?
B00005JKBC|3.0|For the most part the film was good. It just left me flat at the ending. Wait till its a dollor movie and then rent it from the video store.
B00004TWZF|4.0|I'm French and part of the so-called \\"generation Grand Bleu\\" and I can tell I was marked by this movie a \\"long\\" time ago (I've always been a sea lover and I am myself a diver for years now). I have seen the US version (on tape) for the first time and was totally disappointed by the \\"Hollywood happy ending\\" and the music that does not translate Besson's feelings. I understand that different tastes lead to enjoy movies differently but I think that the US version is missing the real message that Besson wished to send.<BR> <BR>Besson was inspired by the life of the real Jacques Mayol (who died recently at 74 and was the first man to descend to 100 meters or 330 feet) and his very complex relationship with the sea. He made this movie around a (yes!) minimalist scenario to emphasize the tragic loving that a man had for the Ocean. Rosanna Arquette just represents the connection between Jacques and the Earth but this is not (to me) the most interesting part, and you can feel that the movie is not totally comfortable with it. Besson chose to emphasize the other part and the photographic scenes above and below the surface are just amazing. You will not see any white sand beaches or coral fish but only the deep blue of the immensity of the Sea. The Mediterranean Sea surroundings are also just gorgeous. Remember that it was just at his time (almost 15 years ago!) a new way to make movies and it showed the different look of an inspired and rising realisator on a new subject. The pace is voluntarily slow to help you relax and breath a bit of this Ocean (I hope we will get one day \\"smell-o-rama\\" video systems !!!), not to have your mind racing. The captivating original score by Eric Serra was made to fit Besson's view of the subject, not for being replaced by another one's sensitivity ! Where does this need to constantly rearrange original productions to the national taste come from ???<br />As a conclusion, it's a great choice to have reinstated the original ending and score butI think that a DVD support should bring more extras than those proposed here (which is why I give only 4 stars)... Anyway, the dream goes on...
0451167716|2.0|Since The Godfather is one of my favorite films, I decided to read the novel, following the tenet that the book is always better than the movie.  Oh goodness, not true in this case.  Mario Puzo writes like a amateur.  Example:  He's goes on and on for 5 or 6 pages about something (details aren't important) and then actually WRITES &quot;To make a long story short...&quot;.  I gasped.  Note, if the novel's writing style was conversational throughout, this would be acceptable.  Much to my dismay, it's not.  <br />I found Puzo to be a quite lazy writer; he just doesn't take the time to think about a better way of forming his words and telling the story.  So, I say if you enjoy the film as much as I do, and yearn for more background story and character development, please please shy away from this horrible piece of pulp.  Just watch the movie again.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|First of, I have not yet read H.G. Wells novel that this movie is based on, though I have seen the original movie from the early 60's (yeah, I know, what kind of sci-fi nerd am I?) However, I know enough about it to know that this movie is NOT like the book. Some of the changes were good, some were not.<BR>The movie begins with the death of the professor's fiancee, which I thought was a nice addition; it created empathy for the guy (no pun intended,) and also a motivation for building the time machine and putting himself in possible danger by using an experimental invention. I liked Guy Pearce's portrayal; a moody, eccentric, almost Dr. Who-like protagonist was refreshing for someone who doesn't swoon for fearless, wisecracking badasses.<BR>On the downside, the logical flaws are many: the often-mentioned fact that the English language as it is spoken today managed to survive an apocalypse and 800 *thousand* years of evolution. Oh, yeah and the only one who can speak said 'old language' fluently just happens to be a young, gorgeous unattached woman. And there's this supercomputer and its flat-screen glass panes that managed to survive 800,000 years of geological movement and erosion. <BR>The main thing I found troubling was the fact that the socio-economic angle that made the book and original movie such a disturbing vision of the future was downplayed to the point of non-existence. There's no mention of the upper and working classes evolving into the Eloi and Morlocks, so the second half of the movie has more of a \\"good guys vs. the monsters\\" feel than a reversal of social classes. The Eloi are supposed to be as tragic and disturbing as the Morlocks are. <BR>Despite the plotholes and watering down of the original lesson, it was a fairly good movie that I don't mind seeing again. It has inspired me to finally read the book!
B000002HPT|2.0|I bought this CD based on what I`ve read in the reviews on this site. <BR>What a disappointment, nothing that reminds me of Awake, Metropolis or Images. No inspiration, No enthusiasm, just like the record company forced them to do the yearly album, so they came to `One more day at the office`. <BR>Ridiculous words (and I don`t expect them to be Jim Morrison), and the music ... Like ELP at their worst ... Bombastic with no inspiration and no enthusiasm (I wrote it before' didn't I?). <BR>Save your money, buy something else from DT, anything else but not this CD.<BR>I gave them 2 stars just because they are DT.
B000001A3H|4.0|*If you could give half stars, I would give this album 4.5.<br />I got into this band based on my fanatical love of Queens of the Stone Age, as well as my admiration for other stoner bands like Fu Manchu and Monster Magnet.  First of all, it should be noted that this band bears little resemblance to Queens of the Stone Age, beyond the fact that Josh Homme is the guitarist for both bands. Josh was merely the guitarist in Kyuss, with vocals being handled by the much more gravelly-voiced John Garcia.  Kyuss's sound was also much denser and heavier, with a more obvious Black Sabbath influence and more jam-oriented songs (there are a bunch of instrumentals on here).<br />Anyway, &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot; is a Kyuss album, not a Queens of the Stone Age album, so let's turn our attention to Kyuss.  The sound is trippy, and the song structures are unconventional and diverse.  The music on this album is nothing short of amazing.  Josh Homme, Brant Bjork, and Nick Oliveri are all excellent and distinctive musicians (especially Josh and Brant) and they were in fine form here.  Josh turns in plenty of pummelling, mesmerizing riffs, and is also effective when he slows things down, as on the second half of &quot;50 Million Year Trip.&quot;  Brant's drumming is precise and varied; at times he's practically soloing in the background.  Nick's rumbling, subterranean bass adds an extra element that really drives home the heaviness of the songs.  John Garcia was a decent vocalist, with a throaty voice that fit the music well, but his range leaves a little to be desired.  Still, when the music is so good, that's a minor complaint, and this album is more tilted toward music than vocals anyway.<br />Of course, everything I've said above doesn't mean much without good songs, but fortunately Kyuss deliver in this department as well.  The fast, roaring &quot;Green Machine&quot; could almost qualify as speed metal; &quot;50 Million Year Trip&quot; similarly starts out heavy before turning into a mellow instrumental about halfway through.  &quot;Thong Song&quot; starts out as an almost gimmicky song, with weird vocals and such humorous lyrics as &quot;I hate slow songs&quot; and &quot;No brains, all brawn,&quot; but then some heavy parts burst out of nowhere.  The lengthy instumental jams &quot;Apothecaries' Weight&quot; and &quot;Caterpillar March&quot; give the musicians ample opportunity to showcase their skills, with some great grooves and stunning guitar and drum work.  On the muscular &quot;Writhe,&quot; John turns his intensity down a notch, laying down some melodic vocals over a driving guitar riff.  &quot;Capsized&quot; is a brief and very pretty acoustic instrumental that provides a nice break before &quot;Allen's Wrench&quot; turns on the heaviness again.<br />To sum up, &quot;Blues for the Red Sun&quot; is a terrific album that deserves a lot more attention than it's gotten.  Kyuss's guitar sound was pretty clearly influenced by Sabbath, but they definitely had a sound and vibe of their own.  Hopefully with Josh and Nick's current band Queens of the Stone Age getting some well-deserved and long-overdue popularity, more Queens fans will turn their attention to this band; I'm certainly glad I did.  I'm sure I'll be picking up Kyuss's other albums soon.ning into a mellow instrumental about halfway through.  &quot;Thong Song&quot; starts out as an almost gimmicky song, with weird vocals and such humorous lyrics as &quot;I hate slow songs&quot; and &quot;No brains, all brawn,&quot; but then some heavy parts burst out of nowhere.

B000002JOH|5.0|Oh man, what an AWESOME record!!! I still can't believe this killer CD is 10 years old. No, it's not like the \\"nu-metal\\" junk you hear today. This album marked the ressurection of metal in the early 90s. \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" began Pantera's rising to the top and they eventually earned the title \\"Kings of Metal\\" with their follow up to the amazing \\"Cowboys From Hell\\" CD. There aren't any weak songs on this, just aggressive, in-your-face heavy music. You cannot call yourself a metal fanatic unless you have this masterpiece. BUY THIS NOW!!!

B000069AUI|5.0|When first asked if I liked &quot;Coldplay,&quot; I responded with a quick No.  I wasn't a fan.  Then, one Tuesday night, I was watching &quot;Smallville,&quot; and I heard the single &quot;In my Place,&quot; and I fell in love with the band.  I quickly bought the cd, hoping that the song wouldn't be the only great one.  I was not disappointed.  The entire cd is truly wonderful.  My favorites are: A rush of blood to the head, In my place, The Scientist...actually, they're all good.  It's the kind of music (for me), that i can listen to when I'm laying on my bed and just think or just listen.  Just listening to the lyrics, the beautiful music, everything about it, it's amazing.  Plus, they don't rip the buyer off with only having 11 songs, because each song is about 5 minutes (with the exception of two or three).  I recommend this to most anyone.  Not all will enjoy the music, but it sure changed my mind about the band.  Give it a listen...you may be surprised.
B00003CXBK|4.0|First of all, the pcaing of this movie is a little off. Whether done intentionally or not, just when you expect an action scene, you're instead given a soliloquy. And just when you're expecting a dramatic speech, someone loses a limb.<br />In terms of plot, character and look, this movie is clearly worthy of five stars. I really enjoyed this movie, the pacing was just a little too jerky.
B0000639FE|5.0|I first watched &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; when I was about eight, so you can imagine how confused I was.  I had absolutely no idea what was happening.  Well, I had never watched it since then until I visited my friend and she owned it.  We watched it, and I left her house, wanting to buy the movie right away.  Not only is Jerry Maguire an incredibly mature and intelligent romantic comedy but the director/writer isn't afraid to have a nice ending.  It seems like more and more, movies have to be sad or depressing to be considered good.  Jerry Maguire proves that theory wrong.  I love this movie.  It's a movie I can watch when I'm sad, stressed, or just want to relax with some friends.  I really don't think I could say one thing that I thought was bad about it.  Tom Cruise is absolutely amazing and made me a fan of his.  Renee Zellwegger, Cuba, the entire cast is great and perfectly cast.  Maybe not all will love this movie as much as I did, but reguardless, it's worth a viewing.  Great people, great music, great story, great movie.  Jerry Maguire will have you laughing, crying, and smiling the whole way through.
B000068G9X|5.0|Hard, raw, bluesy rock.  If you don't own it, do yourself a favor and pick it up along with Danzig II.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|With a second disc chock full of extras, this DVD is well worth the price.  Not to mention three, yes three, versions of the film.  One can see interviews with the voices, the animators, and the producers.  There are also games for everyone.  And the movie, well, it is brilliant.  Not just a kiddie cartoon, it is enjoyable for everyone.  If only we could all live by the message behind this movie...
B00006AW2P|5.0|Yeah, yeah, we all know about the Stone's history...we've all read the same books and reviews. This is the band that made me force my mother to buy me a [money] electric guitar! After learning how to play guitar with this record more than 30 years ago (I still use the same 3 chords), I can FINALLY HEAR THE DISTORTED TUBE AMPLIFIERS ON ROUTE 66. This re-mastered version brings to life the concept of \\"live in the studio\\". There wasn't much dubbing on this LP. I first purchased Ya ya's and Let It Bleed when the re-masters were released. They sound better than the first (1986) CD releases. But the difference is PROFOUND on the early recordings. Listen to Keith's already dirty guitar work on \\"Little by Little\\", his amplifier was LOUD! You can hear Jagger's breathing into mike and the wailing backing vocals on \\"Tell Me\\" much louder and clearer than on my prized mono UK vinyl original!  True, they couldn't sing very well, God love 'em, but neither could I! Yeah man...the Beatles were a cool band, but who could figure out how to play \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" on a Kay guitar? I'll stick w/ Mick 'n Keef...a real working man's band they were!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer has brought a breath of fresh air with his album.  His musical ability is far reaching.  Several Musicians I know have raved about his ability to write complex jazz chord formations along with great lyrcs.  To the average listener it adds up to great music for the ear.  Every song protrays a story that has nothing to do with the negative messages brought to us by the Hip Hop or the Alternative sectors.  I believe that John Mayer is a new Singer for the next wave of kids who like us grew up with Dave Matthews.  He is bringing and living the singer song writer dream much like John Denver, James Taylor, Billy Joel and Dave Matthews giving us a painting of his ability.  If you haven't had the chance to catch him in concert do so because he will leave you wondering how he manages to get the SRV sound one minute and then PUT Dave Matthews to shame the next.  Don't get me wrong I love Dave but John Mayer is on a different Planet.  Lastly the editor is able to voice an option but his option was shallow.  People don't need deep meaning to love a song.  They want to sing and feel good for that three minutes.
B00006HBUA|5.0|Funny!!! I loved this movie. I watched Scooby Do as a child so I had to get the movie. It made me laugh out loud and wish it would never end.
B00005AWMF|4.0|A couple of the songs are not the full length album versions. Also, the songs on the CD are not in the order in which they were released. Still, this is a very good compilation of Sade's songs. Anyone that has heard and liked her will like all or at least most of the songs on this CD. Of course, anyone that has listened to her albums may find songs missing but that's because her sound can be very soothing and likable. It's a good CD to just let play without having to select songs off it.
B000001FVL|4.0|How to describe the Buggles?  How about this:  staccato robotic and electronic sounds coupled with light-hearted sounds, soaring female choruses, electric guitars, new-wave synthesizers, and vocals and an overall proto-industrial sound that would influence Depeche Mode, Camouflage, New Order, and Electronic.  The difference is that the Buggles sound less colder than the above groups.  The title track is a prime example of what I described above.<br />&quot;Video Killed The Radio Star,&quot; historical because its video was the one that launched MTV, is far better than the Presidents of the United States remake.  The distance travelled between different media, from that wireless back in 1952 to the then-present day of 1979, can be heard in the distorted male vocals and the strings, which evoke a kind of nostalgia for the lost past.  The female vocals singing the chorus are classic.<br />Things move to a quicker pace with &quot;Kid Dynamo,&quot; with electric guitars and strings boosting things along.<br />&quot;I Love You (Miss Robot)&quot; with electronically synthesized vocals singing the chorus lends credence to the futuristic setting of this album.  Love those female vocals mid-song!<br />&quot;Clean, Clean&quot; begins with a slow baroque synthesizer before going full force with guitar and drums.  The synthesizer solo in the middle of the song is classic late 70's new wave electronica.<br />&quot;Elstree&quot; is a slower number about the British studio of the same name and tells of the protagonist's fantasy of playing heroes in historical B-pictures.  The song closes with the sounds of a galloping horse.  An electronical version of that stock music from British historical sagas is included as well.<br />&quot;Astroboy&quot; isn't as remarkable compared to the rest of the album.  &quot;Johnny On The Monorail&quot; however, continues with the quick-paced soundscape of synthesizer-mania.<br />This is more of a futuristic mechanized soundtrack for the industrial landscape of the current day and near future than ELO's Time.  Considering that this came out in the new-wave movement of the late-70's/early 80's, this one-of-a-kind nugget is to be cherished for all time.ndscape of the current day and near future than ELO's Time.

B00005JK8K|1.0|this movie was so bad i wish i had never seen it.  You dont even find anyhting out about the war all you see is fighting and blood. Nobody describes what is happening in the movie. Digusting and horrible you would two of the many words to describe it. My advice dont see it. it would be the worst exprience of your life.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|This movie may not appeal to everyone, but it certainly appealed to me. Ben Stiller plays a male model by the name of Derek Zoolander, and Will Ferrel plays evil fashion designer Mugatu. Mugatu hypnotizes Derek and tries to get him to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. The voice Stiller uses while playing Zoolander alone is enough to make you laugh, throw in some great jokes and Jerry Stiller and you've got a nice comedy.
