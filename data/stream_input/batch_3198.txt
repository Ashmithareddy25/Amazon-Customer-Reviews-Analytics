B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Great book - very intense- had to keep reading to get top the end - great story tellers keep going
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|As many others have said I am a long time fan first discovering the guys after Awake was released, buying everything from dt and all the solo stuff. Their music has been played almost everyday in my car for the last i'd say 11 years, a run only surpassed by Rush. I was very disappointed when MP left, but also slightly excited by the possibilities. Then I was glued to the drum audition video releases and even more excited. I fairly quickly warmed up to ADToE and really love a few of the songs and enjoyed MM playing on that album. With all the hype about the one coming out as just called DT I was also excited, but also really started to miss MP and felt the guys were unnecessarily going on and on about the new vibe in the band and the new beginning and how awesome the studio sessions were. Well I think the results are pretty weak besides all the recording levels and drum sound issues I think the songs are so not memorable and the song I feel most excited about is too short  (Surrender to Reason) I do like the Epic but the first few minutes are spent running through the been there done that instrumental sections I know I have heard in past songs in very similar form. How many times can they go to the &#34;nod to Rush&#34; cliche and the song for me is the worst on the album. I am being harsh because I expect more and I don't think they needed a technical wizard on the kit they need someone with groove and feel. Mike is so busy with his math trying to figure out how many drums he can hit in between a song section that he forgot these are songs not lessons in beats per second. Plus as mentioned so often his drums sound like crap. I am harsh because I am getting more upset about MP's departure and not more please with their direction as I had some hope of after ADToE. I will see them this tour as well,  and hope they don't stay clear of the songs MP had a hand it like they have so far. This album is my lease fav so far. Correction the Astonishing is now my least favoriteby far.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Perfect reading for teenage girls; everything a girl could want!  Love, fashion, challenge, courage!<br />tantalizing story line to keep one reading into the night!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|If your going for an all out quality microphone it's probably not the best, but for the price they are offering for it works great.
0316055433|5.0|This books reminded me of everything that made me fall in love with reading and books. It's a delicious cross between Bright Lights, Big City and Oliver Twist/Great Expectations.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Excellent book, if you are a camper/backpacker/wilderness person you will love it. I live in Oregon and have been to most places she referenced which made it even better!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|People getting sick and turning to a zombie is getting old; it would be nice to see if they created a plot that started to understand why or how people are turning without getting bitten. There is very little success in this show, and everyone has accepted this way of life.I have not seen the mid-season finale, but I know what happens and wonder if this is the beginning of the end.
B008602KQI|4.0|Having read the book, I think they did a good job of telling the story.  Makes you proud of what big government can accomplish.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|I bought this for my mom for Christmas, but she opened it while I was at school. She loves it! She loves his music, and her favorite songs by him is Wicked Games, and Twenty Eight.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I LOVE PLAY THIS AND KIDS WOULD LOVE IT ALSO,SO GET YOUR KIDS THIS GAME IT FREE AND YOU CAN PLAY ANYTIME
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I just finished Allegiant and I can't stop crying its so sad. Why must life have no happy endings. Why. =::::(
B003O86FMW|3.0|I liked the first book much better .Catching Fire was very slow to start. Then it got too violent and somewhat confusing.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Great songs, and a fine collection of musicians.  Sadly the fills, are not Phil's.  Otherwise the joy, and the expertise this collection of musicians demonstrates is wonderful.  The love and respect for the music is palpable.  The US tour supporting the album was sold out and understandably so.  Steve Hackett stands up, and stands out!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's fun. I haven't spent hours on it. But it's fun. Kinda wish you could attack at it own pace but thts it.. Oh and jump...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A nice way to escape your current life & get wrapped up in this mostly taboo life of Fifty !
0399255370|4.0|The Day the Crayons Quit comes from the Crayons point of view. Each Crayon crayols out a personal note they leave for Duncan expressing either their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the lot they have in life.<br /><br />Each page is filled with life like looking notes and crayon drawing's featuring the Color writing the note. Some Crayons get used to much, some not enough. Some don't like being used for drawing huge pictures of elephants, and some don't like being solely used for princess gowns. It's like a community in labor bargaining negotiations and your lucky kid reading gets to be the Mayor!<br /><br />Learning the back story of each Crayon could provide a parent and child the opportunity to discuss ways that the Crayons different complaints could be resolved. Not only will this book spark the imagination, but it could be the basis for some critical thinking... Problem solving on a kid level.<br /><br />The Day the Crayons Quit is written by Drew Daywalt and has pictures from Oliver Jeffers.<br /><br />This book colors out a rating of... 4 White Cats in the Snow!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Picked this up for my kids. They love the Youtube, and I was tired of watching them all crowded around my son's 17&#34; monitor.<br /><br />Youtube streaming is fantastic. I normally don't get 1080p content on my desktop, yet the chromecast gets it everytime. Same for Netflix.<br /><br />The TV I have this on IS a smart TV, but the interface is sluggish and horrid. It has the ability to stream Netflix, and we never do it because it runs like molasses. The tablet makes for a very nice interface, and it's already hooked up to my accounts. Win.<br /><br />I have also used it to &#34;broadcast&#34; tabs from my PC for presentations. Very cool to be able to use a big display for showing off my new app while you manage it from your PC. We have even used this for presentations at Trade Shows.<br /><br />I really wish it had a way to natively cast local content, but hopefully that will come. If you want an easy way to get your cloud content on your TV, this works great.
B00GINENG0|5.0|Absolutely love this game tom is so adorable and you can really care for him like an actual cat! Great for young children as well
B007T7MIR0|5.0|Was looking for something like this so I could add and edit various information I wanted to keep on my Kindle Fire HD Tablet. This word program fits the job and does it so well.<br />Other ones I tried just didn't preform as well as this one does! Highly recommend.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|The is smooth and I love the fact it's straight carnage, tons of fun. I wish it was easier to get tokens, but over all that game.
B00G5AVM3S|5.0|You can have so much fun changing photos with a really nice selection special effects.<br />You can take an ordinary photo and make if funny or make it something special that you and everyone you show it to will admire!<br />Highly recommend. If just to play around to see all the variations that you have at you disposal.<br /><br />Also nice for children to play with their photos of friends.
B0000261RJ|5.0|classic dio!fantastic tunes.it has all the power and magic one would hope for in a power metal cd.get it man!
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|Great movie! Its a little slow in the beginning but once the action starts, it is really good. I hope they can produce a follow up for this story line!
B008M4MB8K|5.0|I loved the movie the first time saw it, all the caracters are rich and sustancial , great directing , editing, and acting,
B00CTIHATA|1.0|Rip off! I saw this exact pack at walmart yesterday for $5.99 do not pay this price for something you can pickup way cheaper.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|This movie was worth it! Zack Snyder did an great job, better yet everybody did a great job in the movie. Can't wait for the next movie.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I have read everyone of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I am a loyal reader.  Dust was not one of her best and not one of my favorites, it didn't have the intense protrayal and relationship of the bad guy versus Doc. Scarpetta.  Doc. Scarpetta spent a lot of time reminiscing about her past which got a little boring.  Too much time given in the scencery descriptions and not enough time getting to know the bad guy. I am still a loyal reader and can't wait for her next book...
B007WV05GY|5.0|I've watched this movie so many times.  There are a couple of scenes that are starting to get on my nearvs.  But I love the flash backstop with his wife.  They are sweet and tender and a surprise.  The are so many good actors with beards & grubbed out it's had to tell at first how many good ones are there.  The wolves are great.<br />And I dig it. & of course Liam is very nice & good actor AND an Irish man, very cool.  Think they left it open for sequel
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Just a lovely, well done movie.  Easy to get lost in this movie with a cup or two of hot chocolate!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|A long time fan of Doctor Who, how could I not like it? Ready to watch it again! How many doctors can they fit in one episode?
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I don't usually read or watch WWII books or movies but I can highly recommend &#34;The Book Thief.&#34;  I knew nothing about the book but a friend wanted to see the movie, and I usually like to read the book first, assuming there is a book.  Excellent move.  The writing is definitely different and the narrator, Death, puts an interesting spin on the story.  Rather than focusing on the atrocities of WWII Germany, the book's main focus is the humanity of some.  Read the book and then go see the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I can't say too much without revealing plot twists but that is not what I expected. I think I cried through the last chapter. Great ending to a great series.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It keeps my attention throughout the whole book.  Not boring at all  Love the story line how she is changing him
B009CGAISM|5.0|I have always loved this movie but the disc kept getting scratched so I thought if amazon has it for instant play! I will buy and I am so  glad i did! Great Product
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really like this game. But just like all the other games , I feel they charge to much for the amount of chips you get. Come on people times are tough, why not let it be you guys that finally gives us a little more for our money
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|cookie cutter monster movie, no logical flow, poor explanations, does not portray characters in depth, weird chemistry between the characters
B007B5EDEG|3.0|The characters and plot lines are great, but these books are too long and it feels like the stories are being dragged out somewhat aimlessly.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|OMG! If I was to envision a world where Batman had to take down an Evil Superman and Evil Justice League. This is how I would envision it. We have a team of normal humans with unique and compelling training out to take on the worlds super powered villains and no true superheroes to help. If you like that premise. Go for the book.<br /><br />Excellent foray into the supervillains vs normal humans. You showed us that even without powers humans can still make a huge difference. And some can even be more than human when it comes down to the line.<br /><br />I hate spoilers, so just read the opening sample. Trust me. You won't regret it.<br /><br />If Sanderson keeps this series going, I will buy it.
B00ECLU346|1.0|I wanted tp purchase the DVD for a requested Xmas present, not  whatever I got.  Will never watch this.  Rating the purchase options not the movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Gripping and engaging story that is masterfully told and held me to the very end.  Loved it and recommend it highly.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|the world needs to know that no good can come of war.  for all sides.  it also needs to realize the suffering for everyone. the people we considered our enemies are just as loving and hating as all humans are.  this book should be read by our children and grandchildren.  we need to remember the hollicost, but this book opens one's eyes to the suffering of all during war.  beautifully written.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|One of my all-time favorite books.  There are scenes in this book that send chills up my spine.  Unlike the new &#34;vampire&#34; books/movies, you won't find multiple pages devoted to the color & gleam of the Counts' eyes.  There is no teenage angst in one single paragraph!  It's the original AND it's perfect for the grown-up, grown-past the bubblegum.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Got hooked on it while home recovering from the flu earlier this year.  Started in the middle of Season 2 now I am up to date and wanting more.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Best Bond movie ever. It is not just an action movie, it has drama, a good story and an awesome bad guy.
B00CHCUR9I|5.0|too bad it's so expensive for the rest of the comics because I am a huge fan of the show.
B002RSQGQK|5.0|A personal favorite from Hitchcock's career.  It's great cinema.  Suspense, intrigue and Grace Kelly is one of the all-time beautiful stars.
B00E9A656K|5.0|super fun and I really enjoy how fun it is because its just to fun it's tons of fun. I like it though
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|Testament simply gets better with age. Dark Roots of Thrash is a nice sounding recording with a great set-list. I have seen testament live many times dating all the way back to 1989. They are a band which has gone through many line-up changes over the years but in my opinion, this is their best collection of musicians. The return of Alex Skolnick several years back and the more recent addition of drummer Gene Hoglan has created a &#34;seasoned,&#34; super-group.<br /><br />Testament has always been great live but as the years have passed a couple great things have happened to their live shows. First they have a lot of great albums to pull from when playing live. Second, these guys have become better musicians throughout the years. They are honestly at the top of their game. Third, I think they take it more seriously now...the party years are probably over and this makes for a great, professional, clean, yet fun (and very hard) show.<br /><br />So, Dark Roots of Thrash has a lot going for it. It follows up an exceptional album, Dark Roots of Earth, and they also play some classics and even a few buried tracks throughout the set. The sound quality is certainly above average and the guys are definitely on the top of their game. Lastly, you get your money's worth with this disk. The set list is huge..19 tracks. This is definitely a &#34;must own,&#34; live metal album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it is so addicting. I started playing when it first came out and have since gotten my entire family to play.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  How it dealt with the issues of the deep south and the emotions of all the characters.  How Anvil and Letti put the past behind them.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|I could not make it past the first 75 pages. The writing style gave me a #headache. Such a disappointing departure from the first book.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|I only recently downloaded this app, but so far it's worked really well. I was having problems viewing certain files with Moboplayer, but none of those problems are showing up on this app.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|TV at its finest, great acting and great background. English should be proud of this production, top notch entertainment for adults.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Bright and easy to use! The download is immediate and the power of the light is the best I have seen!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is amazing. I would recommend it to almost anyone who liked the first book of this series. Happy reading and may the odds be ever in your favor. And I hope you don't weep to much.
B00GINENG0|4.0|This is the greatest game since Talking TOM!<br /> I wish I could send him to school other then that love my baby boy!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|This movie has the best 3D of all the 3D movies I own.<br />It full of action and very exciting
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is a master storyteller who engages the reader right from the start.  His charming characterizations of the people of Clanton, Mississippi and the way that familiar characters (Jake Brigance, Harry Rex Vonner, Judge Atlee) turn up and interrelate in many of his stories endears them to you all the more.  Sycamore Row centers around an all-too-familiar plot, the Will contest and the lengths to which the parties and their lawyers will go when there is a fortune at stake.  Jake Brigance has the unpopular task of defending the Will while he deals with the concerns of race relations in the old and the new South.  It is difficult to put the book down and, as always, Grisham leaves you wanting more.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|I am so glad she put out this CD.  I think it's a triumph for her.  She came back after a couple of years and I hear the inspiration songs.  Of course, it was not as good as her albums done in the past like the 90's but it made me feel good.  She is getting a raspy sound to her voice but that doesn't stop her from getting those high notes!  The songs are modernized.  She always evolves with her times.  The 90's, 2000s and now in 2013!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Simple and easy to use. It has nice large buttons and multiple features, exactly what I was looking for in a calculator,
B008KP6ENE|2.0|I can not even get through the first level, due to poor control response. The graphics are great. Thankfully it was free.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My favorite author, I use the pseudonym Mark Twin in honor of Samuel Clemons.  I would be proud to be 1% as interesting
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|This game is epic and it gets tougher but u just got to pull off. It's fun upgrading troops and heroes and the graphics are boss
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Writing!! It is such a gift. Not all authors possess this gift this author does. You see the good side of human beings and the dark side, the good that words can do and the harm. Reading this book was a true experience. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did.
0446615625|5.0|I just love the Camel Club books---wish David Baldacci would write some more to carry on the character's current stories.
B000HX499S|4.0|Loved the movie but it was buffering so may times I will not watch another &#34;free movie&#34; on amazon. The most annoying experience I have suffered!!!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Because we know the future, it was fun to see how the Enterprise was handled earlier on.  To discover how the crew handled things that we knew had already happened in Star Trek.  Wish I had watched when it was created instead of now.  I am really enjoying it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I could feel every bit of emotion in the book. No matter which character I was reading about (even some of my least favorite character) I could really connect. The ending will make your heart stop.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Have you ever had a flashback to a childhood memory, and then said \\"No, that's impossible!\\" And then revised the memory to fit current reality?  In this intriguing story, Gaiman explores the differences in adult perceptions and those of children. It will appeal to adults who retain a remote sense that all is not exactly as it seems, and to younger folk who know that it is not...especially those who have managed to keep in touch with childhood sensibilities.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|I have read every one of the Kay Scarpetta novels.  I like her stories, but have found her last two to be over the top violent, and gross in detail.  Some things should be left to the imagination.  Her older books were excellent, but if she continues on this past I am going to stop reading her books.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I like this very much and it is hard for me to think of eighteen words to say as to why.
B007HACDLK|5.0|IT'S VINCE FLYNN. I SAY NO MORE  HE'STHE BEST I'VE READ SINCE TOM CLANCY.  HE WILL BE MISSED MORE THAN IS PRINTABLE
0783229372|4.0|..what really holds this movie together is the ensemble cast: George C Scott, Roy Thinnes, Anne Bancroft, Burgess Meredith, etc. Legendary acting for an average drama regarding the Hindenburg and it's fateful journey into New Jersey. I enjoyed the movie, but the DVD transfer is lousy. the video portion is substandard and grainy, and the audio, well, i have to turn my set up to at least 30 to hear the character dialog decently.  I'm hoping, one day, that someone at Universal puts this on Blu-Ray with better transfer, and more extras.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another hit by Grisham. I enjoyed the story very much. He is a good storyteller and makes you root for the underdogs.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|The narrative is utterly absorbing and the prose simply shimmers. I can't remember when last I enjoyed such  total immersion in one book.
B002WYH5N2|5.0|Was one of the best movies I have ever seen!<br />Keira Knightley is a great actress. Like her in everything I have seen of her.
B00F6Y3FKW|5.0|It's Bob Dylan folks!  One of the greatest American poets and song writers ever.  Great recordings at a great price.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Love this movie!<br />How creative Julie was.I think I would like a challenge like that!<br />Both Julie & Julia were determind women. Good for them !
B00E6F15HM|5.0|Gorgeous, beautiful, breath thaking music from a great show.  Lots of energy.  For the real Peter Gabriel fan in your family.
B00005NWLO|5.0|I had this album when it came out, it was also my first cassette as 8-tracks left society. There was nothing greater then hearing this album again  after 30 years or so. it has to be one of the best  live album of all-time. The &#34;original&#34; lineup for this tour was at its best for this album. If you remember the original release of One More From the Road, you will be pleased with what was done with this 25th anniversary edition, as far as the extra tunes go, they are comparable to what was originally laid down for the LP. The between song Ronnie banter is also good to here. Great, Great album here.
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|Good quality disc. The movie itself is kind of slow, but once you're into it, it's fine. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job acting as well as everyone else, but don't expect a lot of action.
0670024856|3.0|Though beautifully researched, the story fell flat. The characters seemed one dimensional and as a whole I found it hard to get into. I trudged on actually enjoying the botany and background of Whitaker's knowledge of trees rather than the plot. Really, really long.
B00GFOIUVQ|3.0|This game is immensely entertaining and fun.  I love the game and am completely addicted! There are a few issues with it, however. It routinely crashes on my brand new 16g Kindle (I'm assuming because it's a big program). The player controls are bulky and obstruct key parts of the playing field- a big problem on some of the levels where the perspective seems to be awkwardly framed (accidentally summoning your helpers while trying to run is a pain).  Other reviewers have mentioned the unresponsive weapons controls, but where this seems most problematic is trying to generate maximum runes while fighting enemies.  Thor's reactions to the same tap moves vary and I can't seem to predict why or when an attack will give runes; it could just be me! Apart from the annoying pay-to-play features which block one's capability to earn stars and advance, some of the levels seem to have requirements that can't be fulfilled beyond the cash issue (i.e. kill 10 ice breakers in 3 minutes when it's seemingly impossible to get 10 enemies to show up in the allotted time).  Again, I don't know if it's simply me or a design flaw.  Looking forward to seeing more.
1909313033|5.0|Could not have been more accurate in terms of the life of a spoiled pug!  I have 2 pugs and we laughed until we cried multiple times, well worth the money for that reason.  Would make a great gift to any pug lover!
B0081SRJSY|4.0|Great conversion of the classic board game. Easy to get the hang of and if fun to play. Lots of strategy while keeping it simple
B00G922EA2|5.0|Excellent Game!  I enjoyed the narration, graphics, puzzles and adventure.  It took over one hour to install but once it did it was hard to put down!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book and the whole trilogy I've probably read the series about 4 times i think it's a great read for anyone. The movies are great and am waiting to see the 1st and 2nd parts of the mockingjay. I really enjoy the books and movies.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I loved the movie Side Effects because it was captivating, and it had a really good plot twist. Rooney Mara rocked!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the trilogy and the movies think its a great read for anyone just make sure you read them in order!
B00G6SDX36|4.0|So far its a very durable case. i have dropped it once on the concrete and not a scratch on my phone. However i don't like how dirt can go into the case so easily but it not an enclosed case so its does its job.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was<br />An amazing book you should definitely read it so much thrill and drama so much many new things in it so read it
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Its a shame that the D5200 doesn't come with the lens cap from factory but I am certainly glad I have one of these now!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I was suppose to be doing my home work but how can I with Cut the top: Time Travel HD? On my kindle fire HD? So any ways this is most likely not helpful.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|This app does WORK on KF. But it isnt easy to get it to connect, took me 2 weeks &amp; uninstall of both FB &amp; the game before I was able to SYNC!!! Also Sea Trading DOES WORK w/out fb connect, I played this way for 2weeks. However the app did screw me out of a reward of &quot;crowns&quot; for connecting to fb &amp; syncing. Once you do get to sync it is fine. But major pain.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Excellent plot with lots of twists and turns. A couple of surprises which keeps you reading. Just loved it. On the next one now.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I ENJOY THIS GAME, BUT I CAN NEVER SYNC W/FB! So Im left w/10 neighbors since it refuses to connect w/FB. I have followed the trouble shoot instruction on 2 different occasions &amp; still doesnt connect. I lose out on asking for help. Fix &amp; would be 5stars.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Please fix this game asap! I was enjoying playing. Then, it FREEZES UP!  I would have given it a much higher rating, if It gets fixed!!!  UPDATE:This game is Great! I have found out I had been playing my Kindle so long that it got too warm. That is why the game seemed to freeze up. Have played this game several times since without any problems. And, I have changed the rating to FIVE STARS-WELL WORTH GETTING THE GAME!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book - best I've read in a while. Couldn't put it down. I look forward to the author's next book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It's long and seems overly wordy, just like the stuff Robert Jordan would write, but the pace is good once the Final Battle starts.  Overall, I was satisfied with the book and the ending of the story.  It's been a VERY LONG journey to get to the end of this series, but it did not disappoint me.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|And the good stuff just continues.  I am disappointed at how appalled the parents are at the child's interest in religion.  God is never the bad guy and everyone should be pleased at the pursuit of good. I also hate that &#34;The Good Wife&#34; continually pursues a relationship with her boss. This makes her a not-so-good wife.  At least he was the bigger person and told her there is nothing there.
0060922583|5.0|I loved it.  Recommend it to anyone even considering it.  Maybe I should read it again, it has been so long now since I ordered it, read it and am finally rating it here on amazon.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is very entertaining.  I loved the storyline and how the lead character deals with her personal life all the while continuing on with the pursuit of her career.
B00GX50BD2|5.0|Excelent story found it very informative. Ashton plays his part perfectly.  Plan to watch to watch it again in the future.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|We purchased this Barbie storage box last Christmas for our then three-year old granddaughter.  She loves it still, as does her two-year old cousin.  The box and lid have held up well to being stood on, tugged, dropped and otherwise played with.  The one we have has woven handles for carrying ease.  About the only &#34;problem&#34; we have is when carrying it, the lid tends to pop off.  That is because of the flexibility of the product and zippered corners and is a minor issue.  I came to Amazon to see about ordering another, but the price is higher than I remember paying for the one last year.  We did not get it through Amazon, though. Maybe I purchased it with those JCPenney Christmas buttons.  ;-)
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I love all Garth Brooks work.  Very interesting voice and recordings.  Look forward to any new cd's he puts out.  Recommend.
B00G3Q6VPS|1.0|So, after the Blackout Album I've promised myself to give all next Britney Albums a try.<br />I think Blackout is like one of the best Pop Albums ever, guess thank to the huge help of Producers as Danja and less because of Britney's actual Talent. But anyway!<br />I liked Circus and so I did F. Fatale,<br />but the new Britney Jean which was supposed to be her ''most personal album'' is THE weakest one out of the last 5 (including In The Zone). I don't know her first Albums like Oops...and Baby One More Time so I am not able to judge.<br /><br />Let's begin with the lead single Work B*tch.<br />The Sound is pretty nice if you are working out, however i just hate the lyrics and they do absolutly not fit in our times now.<br /><br />You wanna hot Body? You better work, b*tch. OK! I am okay with this one, you  gotta work out to get a nice Body, that's fine.<br /><br />But!<br /><br />You wanna Bugatti, Maserati, Party in France...You better work, b*tch...<br />LOL ? Seriously? So many People work like 60 hours a week, getting their a**es off at 5am in the morning, coming home very late and tired and she / her Producers tell me you gotta work to get a Maserati? Please.<br /><br />Maybe that's one of the reasons why the song failed.<br />Stupid lyrics, which do not find listeners in our time. The word B*tch, we got it, your a bad Girl and you like to call other People b*tch. And the noizy Sound, that sounds like everything else in the Radio right now. It's good to work out in a gym, but nothing more.<br />That's the difference. I can listen to Gimme More or Break The Ice anytime and don't get annoyed.<br /><br />Perfume is another lame song with lame lyrcis, I was sooo surprised that Sia has written this ''emotional and personal'' song.<br />Some People even compare it to the beautiful Everytime.<br /><br />Way too  electro, way too dull and lame lyrics which try hard to be emotional and dramatic but in the end it's just boring.<br /><br />Another song is Alien, which iseven nice! The one star is probably for Alien.<br /><br />Other Songs as Tik Tik Boom begin (of course) with ''U gotta sex in the eyes...'' Ehh...right, our domina from Work B*tch Video is coming again.<br />Other Songs as It's Gone have the same noisy, David Guetta Sound with dull lyrics.<br /><br />As you can see i repeat myself pretty often, the same way the Album does.<br />I was listening to it pretty much time and I NEVER exactly knew when a song had an end, because it all sounded same.<br /><br />The ''most perosnal'' try with Britney Jean was a fail, same as her Work Bi*tch Video where she had again (as she did on Billboard Awards) Play a domina. It just gets boring. Put something on, take Rick Rubin for slow Songs and Danja for the urban/fast ones and go back to the Studio and record something new.<br />And pelase, leave will.I.am!!!<br />I know Brit had some good time with Scream and Shout but his Songs as Producer and Songwriter are just soooo pathetic, boring and stolen from other Songs, I absolutly cannot understand why she had to work with him so often on this Album.<br /><br />Britney Jean: 0<br /> Blackout: still a Hero.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Well researched and greatly interesting. Fairly obscure topics examined by a passionate writer. Can't wait to read his other books!

B000SXMSJ0|4.0|I love Norah's voice and the tunes here are very well written.  Hard for me to place in a specific genre (easy to listen to but NOT Easy Listening, a bit blues-y but Norah is not singing the Blues here, IMO)
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|Cornwell is either on vacation or is totally off her game on this one.  I got 3/4 of the way through this mess of a book and gave up!
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|I downloaded this game to see if my 73 year old grandpa would like it and even be able to play it. We're both playing now on our individual kindles and having great fun. I totally recommend this app.
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|This is yet another app that will not work without network connectivity. It plays for awhile but then dies with an error message about needing a network connection.
B00BCCEBRI|5.0|I think this is the best collection of guitar and lute available. I have been a Bream fan since I have been young. He is the best and this is a fantastic collection.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I was looking for a completely free app to help me brush up on my Spanish. This is it! Similar to rosetta stone style, but better because it's free! The interface itself is very easy to use and it doesn't take long to zip through a lesson or two.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Read the books. As usual they are much better but still brutal.  the movie had to streamline the story line  long movie.

B00BC5AWNM|5.0|Very philosophical book yet an easy, entertaining read. I have heard that Henry is based on Oscar Wilde. Highly recommended!
B00AQL8VU4|1.0|I give it 1 becase it's free. As soon as I finish the download I had to force stop it. I'm not going to have someone trying to sell me something on my home page. And I will not jeopardize my security in order to shop for apps. I do like shopping with amazon and think you to be a good company.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I hadn't been this excited about bond for a long time. He truly makes the movie worth watching, plus he easy on the eyes.

B005ZB91KY|5.0|Great story line, great action, costumes, scenery, etc.  Builds on the overall Avengers theme across multiple movies.  Everything about the movie is nicely done.  Leaves me wanting to see the next one.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Fairly narrow plot but plenty of twists and turns.  Not a lot of scenery or location changes but plenty of good ole Reacher bare knuckled action and persuasion to reach justice.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie.  Leaves me wanting to see what happens in the next movie.  Great characters, great story, characters, costumes, scenery, technology, etc.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It is so easy. Even if you have never taken a foreign language before you can easily understand and learn with the methods they use.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Excellent movie.  Builds on the Avengers storyline and leaves me anxious to see the next movies in the series.  All are very well done, great actors, costumes, scenery, technology...  Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor, and in Star Trek movie as Kirk's father.  All around enjoyable movie.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|It was good but you only got half the stuff you had to buy the other half for $4.99. But it is really fun once you have it all.
B000V63BN6|4.0|Great collection.  One sour note--they used the abbreviated version of &#34;Do I Do&#34; so you don't even get to hear the Dizzy Gillespie solo.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|A stunning book, marred only by  its overarching ambition.  I hated The Secret History so it was with great trepidation that I picked this up, deciding that I should suspend disbelief, if only temporarily to at least see for myself if it lived up to the many positive reviews.<br />It did.<br />This a fabulous book, with phrasing so glorious, observations so astute, and descriptions so strikingly visual and at once lyrical that I got lost in them, and read them over and over, like one would roll a hard candy over ones' tongue to get every bit of flavor.  To write a single sentence, almost anywhere in the book involved an internal perceptiveness and command of detail that reflected true craftsmanship.<br />The story wasn't bad either. It is a strange tale that manages to be about good and evil, the meaning of life, luck and tragedy, while at the same time involving stolen art, growing up--oh--and it's a bit of a love story too.<br />I dreamed about this book. I couldn't wait to finish this book and at the same time I was racing to the finish, I wanted to savor and luxuriate in this book and didn't want it to end.<br />The book would have been a five star, it deserved a five star with the exception that towrds the end, it got a little preachy, if not subtly pedantic as if the author feared she had not made her point and needed to actually hit the reader over the head with it as if she didn't have the confidence to realize that less is more. Despite that little bit of criticism, it was an edge of your seat couldn't put it down kind of book that I would read over and over, just to relish in the details and pick up what I missed, it was that good.<br />Read it. You won't be sorry.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|Works as expected.<br />Finds most songs quick and accurate.<br />Doesn't find everything (hence 4 of 5 stars), but hey, it's free...
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Excellent reading!!!! A real page turner, Preston and Child continue be impressive. The story line is practical and the characters are amazing
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I really liked this book. I`'ve had a hard time finding a good book. I would read this book over,I don`t do that a lot!I`m just a kid,but still it was a good book! I recommend this to others.<br />A.T.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Really good chick flick. The singing is good and who knew how good Anna Kendrick is at singing and acting.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Based on a true story with some Hollywood effects.  Scary and more proof that evil does exist in spirit form.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Loved it. It was great being together with Kay, benton, marino and lucy again. The winding road of this story was fun to be on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Watching the movie then reading the book made me think that<br />I would be upset with the book not following but for the most part I felt like I was reading the script from the movie.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|To much was going on. I felt like Roth was trying to drag the story out as long as she could. I loved the other two books prior to this one, sure they had there flaws but not near as bad as this one. This book reminds me a lot of Mocking Jay from the Hunger Game series.
B00G70WLJA|2.0|I'm a big fan of the X-Men franchise, and Wolverine is my favorite mutant. However, this movie barely did justice to this much loved character. WARNING: If you haven't seen the movie yet, I will be talking about movie scenes below. Spoilers.<br /><br />This movie takes place after X-Men: The Last Stand, after Wolverine killed Jean. So he's depressed and tormented by this and decides to walk away from being a hero. He goes into hiding in a cave up in the mountains. Then a man whose life he saved years ago sends another &#34;mutant&#34; to fetch Wolverine. I use that term loosely coz her only non-human ability is that she sees someone's death, but the visions come at random and it's only in bits & pieces. That my friend, in my mind, is a psychic not a mutant.<br /><br />She said Yashida (guy Wolverine saved) is dying and wants to see Wolverine so he can say goodbye. At first he said no. But really it didn't take long or much at all to convince him to disavow isolation and travel to Japan simply for goodbyes.<br /><br />At this point, the movie just took a slow dull turn; desperately trying for the mysterious and keep-you-guessing feel. But instead of hanging on to my seat, I kept wanting the scenes to move a little faster already. They did however show a naked Hugh Jackman being bathed by a group of women. And there's a bootylicious frame of him, but not sure if it's Hugh's butt or a body double.<br /><br />So long story short, Wolverine finds out that he wasn't there just to say goodbye. The now dying Yashida wants to take Wolverine's immortality from him. Other than living forever, they don't really provide a concrete motive as to why this man would want to be immortal. So he's pretty much just an ungrateful megalomaniac who wants to live forever. Lame.<br /><br />Don't even get me started with Wolverine's love interest in this movie. There was no chemistry there at all. And at first, she looked like she was barely 18. So when they started making out, I was actually a little grossed out.<br /><br />I can keep going, but then I'll just get frustrated again. I blame the writers and the director for this failure of a movie. With a budget of over $200M, they could have done waaaay better than this. Honestly, if it wasn't Hugh Jackman that starred in this movie, it would have flopped in the box office big time.a little grossed out.<br /><br />I can keep going, but then I'll just get frustrated again.

B00785P2QC|3.0|I love the little game but some goals do seem too hard if not impossible to achieve. Some updates would be awesome!!!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It was a good book, entertaining. An easy read from front to back. If you are thinking it will be like the movie, it is not. I enjoyed the book more. It is a collection of short stories told through a narrative. It makes it easy to put down and come back to later. Great for me having two kids.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Listen people.<br /><br />DO YOUR HOMEWORK when it comes to purchasing tech from these sellers. (Non-Amazon) Many of them are selling fakes. These counterfeit products are almost indistinguishable from the real deal.<br /><br />Remember to look at packaging. Are there any odd dents or cuts in your box? Does the lettering or print on the box seem off to you? These are questions you should ask when you receive your controller. Look at the controller. Do the red lights blink too fast? Are the analog sticks to clicky? Does the home button press all the way down? (Real controllers only go flush, you can't push it further).<br /><br />Official SONY controllers strive to maintain the appearance of being one smooth piece of plastic. Fakes won't offer the same luxury or passion. If you have any certified controllers from SONY, COMPARE THEM.<br /><br />DO NOT BE FOOLED OUT OF YOUR MONEY!!!
B0032KPE0G|1.0|I was alarmed at how promiscuous the female protagonist is.  Since when has it been OK to be anything other than a female virgin on your wedding day?  The fact that Hugh Grant's character failed to see through this wanton woman is beyond me.  Non-virgin wives are bad bets for marriage.  Hollywood should stop feeding the urban leg-spreaders rom-coms like this if they hope to inspire young women to value chastity and modesty.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie for any kind of under-21 audience for the brief nude scenes, the profanity, and the rampant sexuality.  This is definitely inappropriate for our young women hoping to find role models in the media.  I recommend wholesome rom-coms from the 1920s to the 1980s, and especially those that feature such men as Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant.  Movies such as \\"Gone with the Wind\\" and \\"Casablanca\\" prioritize values-based courtships over physiological responses to attractive stimuli disguised as \\"chemistry\\"-based courtships and offer good instruction to young women who aspire to marry well.<br /><br />Young girls, take heart: virtuous women who save themselves for marriage get attractive husbands, not promiscuous ones.  Aspire to become the wife of an important man, not a washed-up bimbo in an age heterogamous relationship with a penchant for stringing along innocent, hardworking men like Hugh Grant's character.  High-achieving men don't like women who play games, nor do they hope to marry an evil harridan incapable of respecting male boundaries.
B00G6YH6G0|4.0|Outstanding writing but at times confusing to follow. Fabulous detail and clear character developement. Worth taking the time to read carefully.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|Pure classic and even if you don't care for subtitles or older films, you will still enjoy this film.  Enjoy
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Gunny Hartman get some Oohrah get up here fat boy Is that you John Wayne lean forward an choke your self how much more could you ask for
B0095G5AFU|2.0|I was using the free version until I saw the pro for free for a very brief time.  I downloaded, and tried to import my free version notebooks into it.  It doesn't do anything.  I might as well keep using the free version.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I relax when I play the game. My dog Holley loves when I pick up my Kindle she know it time to lay in bed and I play solotaire and she gets to lay on her sheet at the end of the bed with me.
B00G3P6VA4|4.0|Good movie but not a surprising ending. Matt Damon was in his typical studly character.  Was bummed I had to buy it and not rent it.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great Christmas movie!  Chevy Chase and Randy Quaid is absolutely awesome in these roles and this is the best Vacation movie! Hands down!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Don't really care for the ending, feels like book 2 is forced on me now. I'll give it four stars.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Unique and fun painting puzzle game that my 3 year old was eventually able to figure out how to play.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Good old fashion , clean , shoot em up movie. Able to watch w younger kids and not have to worry about sex scene. Does have some bad language, but so does regular tv
0399255370|5.0|My 17 year old son read this book out loud to me a few days ago.<br />We never laughed so much and so long as we did when he read this book.<br />Buy the book and read it with your child or any age; you will both have a special time together !!!
1419839365|5.0|Excellent series. It is the perfect gift for someone who is a big fan of the series and wants to watch it on their schedule.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Well written characters, interesting story lines, great acting. This show has it all! I highly recommend it if you're looking for a good way to spend 45 minutes.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie. I look forward to watching the next one. Lots of actions packed and some romance on the side
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|This is an awful release. If I could give it zero stars I would. I have enjoyed every Boston album until now. It's really Tom Sholtz playing every instrument and not doing a very good job at that. For someone who has created studio magic in the past, this is an abomination. It should have never been released. And definitely not as a Boston album. The drum machine used is so bad you can't make it through an entire song without wanting to rip your ears off. The album was terribly mixed and the songs are nowhere near the quality you would expect from a Boston release. It's a shame this is the best he could come up with in over ten years of writing this album. I think it's time to hang it up. I feel so cheated and ripped off.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|This is the best true mob movie ever made! Joe Pesci is amazing and got a well deserved Oscar for is performance. Robert Di Niro and Ray Liotta also are awesome as well!
B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|I'm start out by saying I'm not a Kanye West hater !<br />Okay,second I have almost his whole discography<br />I like his other albums but I have to keep it real this time<br />The record company must be scared of him or don't give a !@#* .<br />You can't listen to this in a music board room meeting and say oh wow that's a hit record .<br />This one of those album when you say I make what sounds good to me and don't care about what you say.<br />It can grow on a fan but not the masses and as a fan it's still a pill to swallow
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This CD is Susan's first complete collection of Christmas songs.  My favorite songs are the ones where I can hear most clearly hear Susan's beautiful Scottish accent (When a Child is Born, In the Bleak Midwinter, Miracle Hymn).  I would like to see Susan do more Scottish/Irish songs - her voice always shines so bright when she sings the more obscure, lesser known songs.  As a professional singer, a character in a play or as her pure, simple and honest self, Susan is a true unsung hero.  She is the modest ideal of ourselves.  I love her unconditionally.  As you listen to her sing this array of songs, she reveals her astonishing depth and speaks to our hearts.  Even though I may not always understand at first listen why Susan may choose any particular song, I quickly discover her deeper, more meaningful reasons.  I trust her to convey a higher message and to take us to a place we will want to return again and again.
0307887448|5.0|My favorite book of all time. Anything and everything nerdy in this book makes it a nerds wet dream. Stop reading this review, and buy it already.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the best Christmas visual and audio spectacles ever.  Saw it in 3D IMAX originally, and it has become a Christmas tradtion for the grandkids to watch it with us...they love the timeless tale, and we do too.  The DVD has served well over the years and now we have the BluRay version...even better!
B00FY2TQMW|4.0|Great series of movies.  This one is a little out there, but makes for a fun watch.<br />Either way fast cars, action, and a great cast.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a wonderful fun little app.  There is nothing really to learn as it is simply a hand and eye coordination game.  You can play it anywhere or anytime and can easily put it down and pick it up again.  Have been playing on a Kindle Fire 1st generation and have had no problems.  The only problem I have is in trying to beat my own score of 163,000 lol.  Warning......it is addictive.  Give it a try and I will bet you will enjoy it as much as I have.  Good luck.<br />K Cable
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This CD is amazing.  Every single song is so catchy and fun.  one of the best albums of the years.
B00957T6X6|5.0|You should definitely be buying the 5-book set because if you're only reading 1, you suck, and if you're buying 5 separately you're dumb.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I have played almost every big fish, G5 game there is.  And this is one of the better ones. The only thing  I found is it is a little to pricey'<br />.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is the best workout video I have ever tried. Its not like other videos where they are screaming at you and the music is irritating and blaring in the background. This kind of has a calm to it but it will definitely Give you a work out!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|One of the best games ever created!! 500 hours and still loving it!! If you stop and think about everything you can learn something from the game. The gameplay is very improved if you played any of the previous Personas! THIS IS A MUST FOR THE VITA!!
B00GPWEPZ8|5.0|I spent the majority of the movie in tears. A simultaneously sorrowful and joyful film about the power of story to inspire hope, heal pain, and bring redemption. I absolutely loved it, and as an actor, it reminded me why we go to all this trouble to make movies - so that we can love each other through them. Emma Thompson as PL Travers is practically perfect in every way, and Tom Hanks and the supporting cast are delightful. It's sentimental, but it was a sentiment I needed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun all my friends and family play it on facebook and there phones would recommend to anyone fun to play
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|Okay, this loom is pretty cool.  My daughter got it from her ELF on the Shelf the day after Thanksgiving and started making bracelets right away.  The colors own the rubber bands are pretty nice, but we got a lot of some colors and just a few of others.  Sort of wish they'd sent the same amount for each color.  The bright pink is not very pretty, more like a red color.  It works great, but I gave 4 stars for the instructions.  Sometimes it mentions the wrong pin number to use.  As an adult, I could use common sense and see that it was wrong, but my 9 year old daughter was confused by that.  Also, there is only instructions on like 3 or 4 different bracelets.  I was disappointed that she didn't have instructions on fishtails and some others.  I guess we'll have to get her a separate book for the others.  Other than that, this is a good product.  On sale at Toys R Us for $10 right now I think!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I woke up this morning to discover that once again, yahoo can't leave well enough alone. I was happy with the way my e-mail was functioning, mostly. But this &quot;upgrade&quot; that wasn't optional is by far the worst. Seriously considering leaving Yahoo. How is Gmail working these days?
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|The dialog is tiresome and dull.  Such convoluted thought processes this world renowned medical examiner puts us through.  There was little new in the development of the characters.
1572816112|5.0|This deck is very unique in almost every way.<br />First off the characters in the cards are very interesting. Their designs are colorful and very, very strange. One of my personal favorite traits of the character designs is how all the Royal cards of each suit do have very similar appearances. Example: the King, Queen, Knight and Page of Swords wear mainly red and gold. It gives each suit a little more personality.<br />The backgrounds give this deck a unique atmosphere, they mainly consist of abandoned looking buildings, billowing smoke stacks rising out of darkened factories, and the ever present Moon shining down upon the scenes. These give the deck a almost melancholic feeling but that is not a bad thing in the least.<br />The cards are printed on a tougher stock than most (they also way a little more then most) and are sure to looking great after a long time.<br />This deck comes with a nice LWB that nicely summarizes the cards regular and reversed meanings. It also helps explain this deck's special spread; the Lunatic (a rather clever pun) spread, which is pretty easy to use after a little practice.<br />All in all this deck is a fantastic deck especially for those (like me) who love surreal images. I highly recommend this to all.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|I really wanted to love this movie. Wow. Save your money for it to play free on Netflix. In one word. Bad.
1594745692|5.0|This deck is just too much fun. First off this is the first time I've seen a zombie apocalypse in a 1950s-ish setting so that's pretty unique right there. The cards are nicely printed and are fairly durable. The artwork and imagery on this card is incredibly funny, it has a feeling of parody (done right) that even if someone gets a bad reading from these cards, they will still leave giggling. This deck is very different from most decks in so many ways. If you're used to reading more traditional decks then this one may take a little while to get used to but it will be entirely worth it.<br />I highly recommend this deck to everyone especially for those who love zombies, funny images, rather tongue in cheek comedy, and a uniquely designed deck.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Well told, well written, with an ever twisting story line that keeps you pinned to the book.<br />I'm ready to read more from this author.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great to display stuff on TV. Lightweight and cheap. Great to travel with you and watch your movies on TV
B00G70K1HY|5.0|Great comic book movie. Which means stop thinking of why this doesn't fit the other movies or the books and enjoy the action.
B005SFS4ZU|4.0|This is a well done and respectable performance. For me though, once I saw the movie version with Gerard Butler and cast, there is nothing better out there for me. I saw that version at least six times and still love it today. I guess it's a case of consumer preference, plain and simple. I don't think a live performance should be compared to a film production, so this is more a review of personal taste versus the equal opinions of those that love live performances like this one. It's well worth viewing, but perhaps not worth keeping in a collection after one or two showings.
030788743X|5.0|very fun book to read. wish there could be a sequel. but well worth your time and movie. enjoy it.
0770435726|4.0|This is a tightly written suspense/mystery which does not unfold linearly.  The author slowly reveals glimpses of the past to explain what is happening.  I found the story to be intriguing but found the ending to be a bit weak.  Still I love a strong and capable female lead which the author did a great job capturing.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day and am very pleased with it.  Excellent graphics and music, and it works perfectly on my KindleHD8.9.  Not necessarily a hidden object game where you have to find a lot of items in one scene, but you DO have to locate certain items and use them on the proper things in order to advance.  Mini-games are not too hard, but not too childish either.  If you get stuck and need help during the game you can tap on the magnifying glass for hints.  I finished the game but am keeping it on my device so I can play again.  Hope there will be more like this.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|The movie stays true to the story of Thor while modernizing the storyline for the 21st century.  Very enjoyable to watch if you are a fan of marvel comics.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I loved this book--for the first third. Then the plot seemed to loop endlessly before veering off into some ridiculous shenanigans that looked like a script for a Hollywood heist movie. Finally, the last pages evoked the tone and high quality of the beginning of ghe book
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is truly a beautiful moving book. With every word written you can feel as if you are there with the characters. The idea of the narrator is also an interesting idea that I found very moving.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Very contagious, uplifting song. Was great price, easily downloaded and played many times since purchase. If you like the song in the movie you will be glad you purchased it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I was not able to install it. An error occurred every time I try to install it in my kindle fire
B00009Y3L4|5.0|What's not to love, Liza is the Best & the music is to live for. It exceeds excellence in many forms.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Worked flawlessly, all the necessary cables, including flex connector for HDMI a nice touch for TV's close to the wall.  Looking forward to more apps and or directly from browsers or files
6305428042|5.0|This is my all time favorite Halloween movie! I love Bette Midler, wonderful actress. I will watch this movie every year!
B000VUCIZO|4.0|The book reads as a pleasant conversation with a very friendly guy. The pace is a little uneven. Some parts seem to drag on, the days before the home brew club for example, and others fly by, with little detail.  I can't speak for the accuracy of the facts but the telling feels so earnest. A point I can't decide on is wether Woz is being boastful, enthusiastic, are honestly factual. Many of the passages read similar to &#34;Then I invented this, and it was great, I was so smart.&#34; But it is apparent from the overall story that Woz does not seem to be self effacing.<br /><br />Bottom line: I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of the personal computer. I also recommend it for people who enjoy reading about Steve Jobs as Woz's sense of fun and wonder are a real counterpoint to Job's intense style. The two were the yin and yang that made Apple and the personal computer.
B00003CX9E|5.0|It is a great, great classic movie of interesting historic value. Orson Welles is a wonderful actor as Citizen Kane alias  Randolph Hearst, the most controversial newspaper publisher in History!
B005PK57NU|5.0|At first glance at the title, I didn't think I'd care for the show....a philandering husband with a wife who didn't dump him on the spot. I think a better title would have been 'The Good Mother.'<br /><br />The writers and actors do a superb job portraying real life relationship dilemmas. The sub plots - quandaries of legal firm management and interesting clientele keep one coming back and enjoying the ride.
B001HN694K|5.0|I love Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. It is one of their great smashing successful movies they make together.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Boring slow moving.  Very predictable and author made point early then just kept at it. Never developed any other characters to give balance.
B00005JPO1|5.0|I love Harrison Ford and I love Steven Spielberg movies! It is one of their best and most popular movies. Indiana Jones will always be well remembered.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am hooked. Waiting for the next season to continue to follow.<br />Loved both characters. Had to laugh at some of the things that<br />Sherlock would do and how John Watson would tell him to behave<br />and try to act normal. Great show.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I love Dan Aykroyd. I love Bill Murray however my wife hates him but loves this particular movie. Funny, zany and off the wall!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|The available tiles are highlighted which makes them easier to see.  There are a lot of stacking configurations which enables you to choose a configuration which will play very quickly, or one that will require more strategy.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I love Tim Burton movies. I love Batman, comic books or movies. I love superheroes! This four movie pack is a great entertainment!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|if you need to read an amazon review for this game....you are misinformed! a collection of some of the greatest videogames to ever be developed, if you have never played MGS you need to buy this!  Mainly bought this because of the inclusion of Peace Walker, but i pretty much collect these games at this point anyway.  Must have for true fans or a clutch collection for newcomers
B00006ADD5|5.0|I love Peter O'Toole! The Lawrence of Arabia movie may be forgotten by most people but not by me! The old epic has a cornucopia of information about the Middle East we still could use today, from the book by T.E. Lawrence, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
B008I3QZKU|3.0|It's just not what I expect from the Killers and up until now I've loved everything they've done.  More mellow than anything they've ever put out, and there are too many story songs.  Someone should tell them that Bruce Springsteen did the &#34;we got married because you were pregnant and now we're not happy&#34; song years ago and he did it better.
B000E33W1W|5.0|I love Dan Aykroyd! I love Bill Murray! I also love those haunt cruisin' ghosts as they gobbled up haute cuisine dishes of some ritzy hotels! What a wonderful mess!!!
B00C74SHRK|5.0|The word 'journey' is bandied about far too frequently these days: My Weight Loss Journey anyone? Perhaps 'odyssey' would be a better way to describe this book though it somehow conjures up a majestic mode of travel, and really, that couldn't be further from the case here. This is (there's no getting away from it) the story of a boy's tormented journey from teen-hood to maturity wherein love, loss, art and death are the prevailing themes.<br /><br />The first section of Donna Tartt's long-awaited third novel is a tour-de-force, a compelling and completely convincing rendition of what it must be like to survive a terrorist attack and essential to understanding what happens subsequently to the book's narrator, Theo, as he gets buffeted along by the fates, alone and abject. A spectacular quote plucked by the author from Nietzsche sums up Theo's belief that &#34;We have art in order not to die from the truth&#34;. The bewitching Goldfinch painting could either save him or destroy him.<br /><br />&#34;...as I walked I had the oddly appealing sensation that I was undoing myself, unwinding myself thread by thread, rags and tatters falling away from me in the very act of crossing Thirty-Second Street and flowing along amongst the rush-hour pedestrians and rolling along from the next moment to the next.&#34; The writing throughout is formidable and I found myself utterly immersed in this other world, this inner and outer world of Theo. I could quote whole chunks but Ms Tartt's book is a threnody, a complete and beautiful thing, to be taken as a whole.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It is an interesting movie. I love Russell Crowe movies. My wife wanted both the book and the movie. She enjoyed them vastly.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Loved this book, the meaning and message behind it is great! Was hard for me to put down, really enjoyed!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|It is a wonderful and very cute Sci-fi movie about a sweet harmless marooned alien from another galaxy. He was fortunate to be discovered by children who befriended him instead of the cold inhuman government to be use him for science research.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This was just great action and great plots.  What a great story and a series that must be seen. Just great.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|My wife hates Stephen King stories but this is one of the very few exceptions. Master of macabre assembly line horrors finally made something she vastly enjoyed.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Again great action with great actors.  The plots were great but the action was the best.  All in all a must see series.
B000B8QG0O|5.0|The movie is a wonderful wonderful story about toys become people, act like people, think like people and have feelings like people.
B001P4ESGC|5.0|This season was just a good as season 1.  The plots were great with a surprise ending.  Loved watching the series.
B0009MAO46|5.0|This is a &#34;toys are people&#34; movie. Toys 'r Us, really mean us people. They have feelings just like us.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|First movie I remember that peaked my interest in SciFi when I very young. I was/am amazed that it was made so early in the history of filming. Also was shocked to find that a artist from Walt Disney studios help with the project.
B0089EHWQE|2.0|People seem to love opening their reviews of this book with gifs of ugly crying. I see your ugly crying and I raise you some rage:<br /><br />Many others have said this and I fully agree; this is not a love story.<br /><br />This is a story that revolves around an immature, self-centered, vacuous woman named Louisa. She has no desire to do anything in life or better herself in any way, she’s perfectly content to work whatever job she can find, allow herself to be stuck in a loveless relationship and forever remain a selfish child. For God's sake the 'woman' is 26 and still has the type of immature fights over clothing with her sister that you’d expect from a pre-teen.<br /><br />She also has zero skills related to the care of the disabled and yet somehow gets hired to be the caretaker for a quadriplegic so clearly, she isn’t the only idiot in this book.<br /><br />The man she’s been hired to look after, Will, used to lead an incredible life. He was wealthy, successful, adventurous, athletic, passionate and intelligent. Basically the complete opposite of our MC. He was injured in a freak accident and is now relegated to a wheelchair and his spinal injury is high enough that he barely has the use of his hands.<br /><br />You’d think his story alone would slap some sense into Louisa.<br /><br />WRONG<br /><br />Wanna know what changes her? Huh? Do ya?<br /><br />A MAN.<br /><br />This is where someone will likely want to argue with me. They’ll want to tell me that’s not how it was because they’ve convinced themselves that there’s another reason. Well, there isn’t. She doesn’t change her mind because she realizes that any day could be her last. She doesn’t change her mind because she realizes that she’s let her past dictate her present. She doesn’t change her mind because she realizes that she hasn’t really been living at all.<br /><br />She changes her mind because Will all but forces her to step outside of her comfort zone. He tells her that she’s intelligent *snort* and that she should pursue fashion because she likes to dress eccentrically.<br /><br />Yup, that’s why she does it. Because he said so. Because his opinion of her means everything. So, for those of you who would like to argue about this, I'll have nothing to say in return that I haven't already.<br /><br />I had a lot of other issues with Louisa but they’d all be spoilers and would likely fuel a full-fledged, f-bomb laden rant from me so I’ll keep them to myself.<br /><br />One thing that struck me as singularly strange about this book was that towards the end of it the first person perspective shifted from our MC to other characters. I have no idea why. It didn’t make me like characters I already hated and it didn’t further the story in any way.<br /><br />That said, the moral of this book is a good one and the writing wasn’t bad, if a little inconsistent on the details at the end while trying to make the events fit together. Those are the only things that kept this from being a one star review. In the end, the main character absolutely ruined this for me. I disliked her so much that I didn’t even read the epilogue because I couldn’t give a crap what she ended up doing with her life.<br /><br />Oh, and one last thing. Will? I liked you at first and I cannot imagine what I would do in your situation but I feel like everyone around you was too nice to say this so I will: Screw you, you hypocritical, self-centered, narrow minded prick.
1572707208|5.0|Get this Audio CD and listen to it over and over. I started getting up at the same time every day (5:30) and after only 1 week, I don't even need to set the alarm.  (Scary, huh?)<br /><br />Doing this, in concert with having my 'A List' written out the night before has dramatically improved my life in less than a month, especially in ways that I wasn't even ready to address yet. (Play it in your car all the time.)<br /><br />This is a great thing for any person, but for me personally, with a raging case of  ADHD (Robin Williams level at least) it has given my personal productivity a quantum leap.<br /><br />Thank you Mr Tracy for organizing this wisdom into an easy-to-digest format for folks like me.
1616551607|5.0|Wow. Just…wow.<br /><br />I can draw. I’m actually pretty decent at recreating anything you place in front of me. But the thing is, I can’t create. I can’t sit down, imagine a horrifying monster or a beautiful fairy and make it come to life. My lines always end up wrong or the features not quite what I picture in my mind. That said, I’m always more than a little in awe of anyone that can flawlessly pull creatures from their imaginations and with the tip of a pen or the stroke of a paintbrush give them life on a piece of paper or a canvas.<br /><br />This is not a pretty book of animation that you can flip through in a few minutes, nor is it one to set on your coffee table so that guests have something to do. At least I wouldn’t recommend putting it there if you plan on conversing with them because the second they pick it up they’re likely to fall under its spell and be lost to conversation and company.<br /><br />What this book is, is completely transcendent. Within it is page after page after page of gorgeous artwork. I can’t tell you how many times I paused for minutes on end staring at a creature or a landscape and marveling at the talent that it must have taken to create such a being or place. My fingers ran over lines drawn in pen and ink, the swirling mists of watercolors and rough, yet brutally mesmerizing sketches.<br /><br />The art was ethereal, exotic, alien, terrifying, feral, mythical, creepy and whimsical. Each painting or sketch pulled an emotion from me, each drew the eye.<br /><br />Mind? Blown.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the books because my teen children kept telling me how good they were and that I should read them so I finally did. This story is gripping with fascinating characters. Very well written.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It dont work on my kindle.i advise nobody to download it.why want it work.please write back so i can get it started.
031286504X|5.0|Six years ago I ordered this book off Amazon.  I was going to college and working at night near the airport in Seattle, and that night it snowed so bad I had to turn back or risk getting stuck on the highway, already full of abandoned cars and trucks.  I got home and tromped to the mailbox, at least warmed by the idea my present to myself had arrived.  It was this book, of course.<br /><br />I sat down on the edge of my bed and started to read a little.  I couldn't stop though, and I didn't move for hours until I got to a scene that is so heartbreaking I had to put it down for a bit.  I finished the entire book by dawn.  In Seattle its never so cold for long, and the snow was already melting.  It was time for classes, but I didn't feel like I had missed any sleep or dreams that night.
B002RT85RW|5.0|I use these to archive photos and data.  The price is great. So far no bad discs. Quality seems to be comparable to Verbatim.  Highly recommend.
0316055433|1.0|I'm one of the obvious minority who hated this book. I really thought I would love it, but I found the writing intolerable, and the plot incredibly depressing without any creativity or beauty to make up for it (think &#34;The Story of Edgar Sawtelle&#34;, which I loved). I suffered through the whole thing, but I really wish I hadn't. I'd feel better if it were half as long so I hadn't wasted so much time on it. The Vegas portion especially could have been about two pages long (&#34;We got wasted. We laughed. We passed out. We got up and stole some stuff. We got wasted. We laughed. We passed out.&#34;… ad nauseam). Most of the characters are dull at best and awful at worst, without any redeeming qualities that I could see-- even the main character. They're flawed and bummed out about it, but not enough to consider becoming better people. And Tartt spends an awful lot of time trying to make us care about the characters by repeating their problems and sadnesses a million times over, none of which end up succeeding. Total waste of my precious reading time.
B00064WSOQ|5.0|The Power to Believe (2003) is the last studio album by King Crimson. Over a decade later, there's talk of a reformation, and I certainly hope it materializes. If it doesn't, then their legacy is solidified as the premier progressive rock band. What began in the late 1960s with the iconic In the Court of the Crimson King ends with this very impressive and underrated album. Heavy in sound, and bold throughout, this album hits hard, with doses of metal in a lot of the songs, namely LEVEL FIVE. For a change of pace, there's the solid ballad EYES WIDE OPEN, and the dazzling ELEKTRIK, which has a sort of 'far away' sound to it. Crimson never ceases to amaze me with each album more or less reinventing the band, and pushing the boundaries further. A good example of this can be found on the song HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU HAVE TO BE HAPPY WITH, which has a metal and grunge sound to it. Overall, this album ranks high among my Crimson albums. Don't miss this unique but worthwhile release.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|This. Is a cute movie  , especially if you like wizard of oz  it was a  good price. Worth buying in 3d
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This was a very exciting fast paced thriller.  I could barely put it down and when I was finished I was sad that it was over.  I read all of Preston & Child's books and this was one of their best.
B008JFURII|5.0|RED 2 picks up where RED left off, minus, of course, Morgan Freeman - bummer, I liked him. But along with Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Mary-Louise Parker and Helen Mirren (from RED), we get Byung-hun Lee, Anthony Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones added to the mix and fray. And, what a mix and fray it becomes!<br /><br />Zeta-Jones is great as a Russian secret agent (who had a relationship with Willis earlier in his CIA black-ops career). She and Parker have some great back-and-forth scenes. Lee is hired to kill Willis and, well, I don't want to spoil anything, but he does a fantastic job in his killer/assassin role. And, Hopkins, he is just amazing. What a versatile actor. You can really believe, the way he acts, that he has been held captive and probably experimented on, aside from other activities that may have occurred to him, for three decades.<br /><br />Once again the Retired Extremely Dangerous crew must stop the worst of all possible scenarios from happening while avoiding being captured or killed by both enemies and friendlies. And they are forced into it after an online document attaches Willis and Malkovich to a very dirty secret that happened 30 years earlier, though they were not part of it, that very much threatens life today. As for Parker ... well, she is itching to get back into some action. Seems our lil Kansas gal doesn't want to stay in Kansas. Mirren does not have as prominent of a role, but she is very in-character as she is reactivated by her British spy masters. Malkovich is classic and just as paranoid, if not more so, as he was in the first installment.<br /><br />This is a rocking shoot-em-up, explosion-filled, car-chase-full, action-packed flick with ample one liners for comedy relief that is a very worthy sequel to the first. Not sure if I like one over the other. They are both worth the price of admission (or DVD or Blu Ray) and a great back-to-back evening and, for me, earn 5 stars for pure entertainment value.
B0018OAPAW|5.0|A great piece of work from an exceptional band.  There are wonderful nuggets of music & Dexter's lovely way with lyrics throughout this cd. A work of art.
B0060D0S12|5.0|Great movie.  It is for all ages.  My 2 year old and 12 year old grandsons both like the movie.  I personally enjoyed the movie myself.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|While the film's target audience is clearly people in recovery or otherwise struggling with addiction (not unlike 28 Days, or Clean & Sober), Denzel Washington's character development is superb!  Frankly, I didn't know that Washington had such acting chops in him until I saw this film.  He is clearly right in the same camp along with Sir Anthony Hopkins & Dustin Hoffman.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Drizzt is so addicting. From this very first book and onward they'll only go from great to spectacular. A must read for any fantasy fan.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Just started reading last night and I was already hooked at the prologue. Already looking forward to picking it up again!
1781162646|5.0|wonderful read, easy, fast and very good. I found that Joyland was  the right mix of everything that I'd expect from Mr. King.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I've always loved this movie and it makes me laugh as much as it did the first time I watched it YEARS ago!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Giving this only one star because I am not a You Tube fan.  To many times they contain viruses which I have had my fair share of problems with.  It is not worth putting You Tube on a good computer.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|I already have a copy of this movie, it was released earlier in Mexico but I thik I´ll buy this one too, both because it´s an extended edition and it will help Reach Out WorldWide, Paul´s foundation. That´s a good cause and I´m glad we can be part of it. Good one from Universal.
B009O2XY12|1.0|This was a fun game at first but became so much more complicated I ended up deleting it from my kindle.
B005V4FJC4|3.0|Wanted to like it, wonderful voice.  Production is understated to the point of distraction.  A little like hearing my Dad learn how to play the UKE.  She has a classy voice but took some of the phrasing in unclassy directions.  This seriously sounds like someone got a great singer to lay down some tracks on garage band and had no money left for a musician and no favors to call in.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|Good on Pc.  Cann't get it on my kindle fire.  Just bought a samsung tab 3.waiting g to get so I can get it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It seems this book had some of potentially best parts just skipped over in a matter of a page, and sometimes just a couple of sentences. I see no need for the author to cut that much of the story to keep page count down. Sometimes I even went back and re-read to make sure I didn't double skip through a page.  But, even with that, the story is still compelling and I absolutely plan on continuing to the next book in the series.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My TV already has netflix/youtube apps but they are very slow. At the beginning I was not sure if I should pay $35 for this just for the speed and convenience.<br /><br />After playing it for 2 days I feel it's worth the money. You get same flexibility as your phone while you have everything display on a HDTV instead of a small screen.
B004CS7R70|1.0|Do Not Buy This Product. It simply does not work. You need to be at one specific distance to get any enhanced view and that's not practical...and the company that sells it does not stand behind it. When I called to tell them that my disabled father could not benefit from them and they did not work well they started arguing with me and telling me that they would not give me a full refund even if the product was defective. I shipped at my expense it back and took a &#34;restocking&#34; fee loss. In the end, between shipping and their restocking fee I took a 25% loss on a product that did not work. Do Not Make The Same Mistake That I Did! Avoid this company and avoid this product.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I just love all the &#34; Pendergast&#34; stories. His new protégé, Corrie, is a nice touch. Also, I'm a big lover of Sherlock Holmes, which made the story so much more interesting. I look for to more &#34;Pendergast&#34; books. Please just keep them coming.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I am a fan of the Dark Knight trilogy (Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises).  When I watch The Dark Knight Rises, I was really impressed with Tom Hardy's interpretation of Bane.  And I loved the movie.  So when I seen the Bat Cowl crushed, in this Limited Edition set.  I had to get it.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|G5 Entertainment did it again with Twin Moons. This game was so fun to play. I am starting on my second time around, this time in adventure mode, then I will play it again in the hardest mode. There are lots of great places to explore, lots of items to find and some neat puzzles to figure out. I like the fact that there is a story that unfolds slowly to let you know what is going on. I would highly recommend this game to all of those HOS enthusiasts out there and anyone else who wants to try their hand at something new and wants to be entertained. I am ready for the sequel anytime, I just wish that the games and their sequels didn't take so long to come out. It seems like I am always waiting for a new game. ENJOY!
B004I11VZA|4.0|For those not familiar of Ip Man, he is the mentor of the late, great Bruce Lee.  Ip Man 2 (obviously the sequel) takes place after the events Ip Man.  Though (in my opinion) this movie is not as good as the first one, it is still a  great movie to watch.
B00GET4DMW|4.0|Not as Good as the Original. This is true for most sequels though. There must be a fine balance between keeping true to the original and making it stand on it's own. In this case, it seemed like a failed attempt to make it just like the original. The story line of teen anx overriding almost every aspect of life was kind of boring. Some good action, but nothing like the original, especially when it came to fight scenes of the main characters.  Also, the new concept of &#34;everybody can be a superhero&#34; was hard to swallow. The Jim Carrey character was implausible as well. Character development and back story is weak almost to the point that it seems they believed the viewer would buy whatever they sold, no matter how pretentious and petty.<br /><br />The names of superheroes, and especially the name of the arch villain, are great examples of the pretentious and pettiness of this sequel.
B001AGXEA6|4.0|Ahh Beetlejuice.  This is just a classic film.  And I had to have it on Blu ray.  Michael Keaton was phenomenal in this movie, and had you smiling pretty much throughout.  Outside of that I mean, there really isn't much more to say than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|In my opinion it is a classic and timeless movie. Our family watch it at this time of year.  Nice
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Oblivion was a good movie.  I like Tom Cruise, but I am not a huge fan of his in particular.  But Oblivion had me sucked in, for most of the movie.  I would recommend this movie to just about anyone
0385360185|3.0|I bought it as part of the set of four.  Entertaining but not great literature.  Gotta like S & M.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Adrien Brody really surprised me with his performance in Predators.  I was skeptical at first when I heard he was casted as the main character, but he proved me wrong.  Now I really enjoyed Predators.  It gave us a little deeper look as how the Predators adapt, and try to remain &#34;the apex predator&#34;.  This is a good watch for sure!  Especially if you like Predators
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Creepy.  Good.  Very detailed.  Just enough gray areas between the main characters to make it interesting.  I generally only do audio books anymore because I have so little time to read, but I found the time for this one.
B008F9E306|3.0|I am a huge fan of T.I./T.I.P.  Trouble Man, in my opinion was a minor step back from his previous work.  There are a couple tracks that I enjoy, but considering his older albums that you could just about let the entire album play in order and enjoy the whole album... this wasn't as good in my opinion.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Always a treat to read a Cornwell tome.  I never can put them down, sleep be damned.  You won't be disappointed!

B009LDD1X0|5.0|How can you not like the Big Bang Theory?  The story lines are never tired, even when I have seen that particular one once or twice before.  I think it's the funniest stuff on TV.
8866137405|5.0|This is an amazing planner and it comes with galaxy \\"star wars\\" print pages on the inside. I would recommend using gel pens or pens that write on black because on the galaxy print pages, normal black ink won't show up. This isn't a problem for me, however, because I have a plethora of gel pens!<br /><br />Everything about this planner is perfect, from size to weekly notes, to address book, etc. I couldn't have asked for a better planner! For more photos of the interior of the planner, visit moleskin's website. They have a lot more images than are available on amazon.<br /><br />[...]

B00FPH6PRK|5.0|This was FREAKY. My husband and I have watched scary movies for years. Only twice has he watched a movie that made him hide behind his blanket or jump, and this was one of them. The other was Insidious. This had me hitting the internet for actual footage from the Warrens and I ended up finding scary stuff that will make you a believer in an instant. They were very involved in the making of this film - which made it even scarier since it's from their real-life catalog of experiences.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|GREAT CD.  Has everything Seether has done so well.  Always a good CD to listen to no matter where you are or what you're doing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Very entertaining! Interest was held throughout the entire movie! Although an &#34;action&#34; film with violence and weapon use, it was not inappropriate for younger viewers , as there was not vulgar language or graphic adult content. Excellent cast!
0385360177|3.0|Since it was the craze sweeping the country a couple of years ago, I bought the full set in an audio version as I drive A LOT for work.  It was fine and you were left dangling enough at the end of each book to make you proceed to the next.  Would never listen to it twice, though.
0767919408|5.0|This is the way history should be presented. Bryson keeps the reader wanting to read more and more . Definitely recommend.
1846573785|3.0|I should have stopped at this book but had bought the set of four so didn't.  I think this one might have been the best.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I am addicted to this game, and the price was right (free)!  Time of play is limited by the amount of &#34;gas&#34; in the tank, but this allows me to put the game down and get some sleep.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I enjoyed the story line very much but I thought there were a few slow parts. That being said, I enjoyed the setting.
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|This was not much use, not even as an entertainment.  The elements were fairly basic and manipulation of input was limited. If you're looking for something to unleash your creative juices, this ain't it.  If you want something to amuse your 3 year old, this might work for short time periods.
B005KMX866|5.0|Chris Isaak  and his band put their heart and soul into these recordings.  I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert and performing many of the songs on this album.  It was incredible.  I have been a long time fan but this recording is one of his best.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|I like the help this app gives, and it's nice to have on the Kindle. It doesn't get in the way of other activities.  It doesn't post endless demands that you update it and reboot.  It's kind of like a 'roomba' for Kindles.  Wish I had something this straightforward on my PC!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|The movie didn't follow the obvious and predictable conclusion. The plot was full of surprise and caught my attention for the entire time frame.

B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|I should preface this by saying that I am already a David Baldacci fan. I enjoy the King and Maxwell books, and this book was no exception.  It is so tightly plotted that you really have to pay attention to even the smallest detail while reading. It twisted and turned so many times i lost track. I stayed up way too late trying to unravel the mystery. It was evenly paced, if you can call roller coaster even. The book can stand alone, but if this is your first King and Maxwell, you'll probably want more, they're addictive, as evidenced by their move to television. *I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.l
B007IXWL2C|5.0|5 stars all day! Loved how this book opposed to 1&2 went into to details on Ana and Christians feeling. Detail on events other than sex lol! Don't get me wrong a little erotica is nice but I loved the characters ! Hurray and job well done EL James !
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Mrs. Roth is an incredible writer, and I have been completely engrossed in the first two books.  But I must say that I do not agree with her choices in ending the series.  I am pretty ashamed of this, but once I realized what was happening, and that it was final, I put the book down and cried my face off.  I have no intention of finishing those last few chapters.<br /><br />I wasn't nearly as glued to this one as the other two, but I so badly wanted to know how it would end that I didn't mind.  Then, suddenly, &#34;nothing&#34; and &#34;everything&#34; happened all at once.  Unlike the explosive revolutions in the previous two novels,  the conflict in Chicago is resolved with a quiet conversation between four people.  But then, the abrupt deaths of important characters in Divergent seem like mere setbacks compared to the jarring losses we experience directly after this simple reconciliation.<br /><br />I appreciate a good, tragic conclusion to an intense story, but I was not prepared for this one. Maybe I should have been, and maybe I'm being immature for not understanding why it all had to happen.  And maybe I shouldn't have picked up these books as a means of distracting myself from two recent deaths in my own family.<br /><br />I guess the only advice I can give to potential readers is to progress with caution.  If you want a happy ending, end with Insurgent.  It's as happy as things are going to get.

B00CSYR432|1.0|I haven't been this disappointed in a Ghibli film before.  Not even Ponyo, which was terrible, had me this indifferent to it.  The animation is gorgeous, as you expect from Studio Ghibli, but it's just pretty wrapping around an empty box.  The film is utterly forgettable, a standard romance plot with boring characters and numerous subplots and conflicts that all get resolved with a hand wave.<br /><br />For example, there was a conflict in the plot involving the two romantic leads potentially being brother and sister due to a convoluted back story, but that proves to be one of the film's major flaw.  The back story is so convoluted and hinges on so many coincidences that in the end, you're not sure you quite believe it in the end when a character never before introduced in the film suddenly comes out of nowhere to just *tell* the audience that, no, these two aren't related, so their romance is okay.<br /><br />But even assuming you do buy what said character tells you, what ultimately makes this film fall apart is that it commits the cardinal sin of being boring and forgettable.  Immediately after finishing the film, I found I could not recall a single character's name, nor could I remember most of the events that filled it's running time.  My brain immediately decided that nothing in this film was really worth committing to long term storage and threw most of it out and I feel not inclination whatsoever to see it again.
0525953728|5.0|this book is so great it inspires me to want be be a navy seal when i am out of school i too one day want to deffened the country like all of those brave men and woman i give them all thank yous and hope they make it back home safe so they too can see their families like i can see mine.

I hate when he isn't confident, secure and doesn't man-up! I get enough reality in real life. Please make my fiction characters bigger and better. I'm begging you!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Can''t wait for season four to come to the states! Great series with a fabulous cast. What more can be said!
B005PK57IK|5.0|It's fun watching these episodes one after another.  I love streaming TV episodes.  It's so convenient to watch this way.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love this game  and  I will never delete it ever. It's fun and the best part of  it's free. I wasn't disappointed when I go  this app an  I highly recommend this app to anyone.

B009XIXVU6|4.0|*And the Mountains Echoed* by Khaled Hosseini (2013) is the third in the Kite Runner trilogy centering on Afghans and Afghan expats. His characters are a bit stereotypical and his outlook a bit optimistic in my view, yet Hosseini is a captivating writer whom I will continue to follow. His descriptions of the wastelands of his native country are haunting. A thoughtful reader will detect that moralism and misogyny are not Moslem traits, but intrinsic to humanity, only amplified in some of the Moslem world.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun but sometimes the levels become unbeatable you have to play the same level multiple times to finally win.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The third in the series was obviously wrapping up the story much quicker than the first. Still a great story but would have liked e d more depth to the story since the characters were built up in the previous books. All in all a quick read and enjoyable. I will continue to read her books. I am intrigued.
0061733199|5.0|i gave it 5 stars. buy it and you will see for yourself. Dont question it, buy it. The most useful survival book i have and it covers any and ALL scenarios
B0089LOG02|5.0|I had heard about orphan trains previously, but never read a story about a child who was placed on an orphan train.  I could not put the book down.  I loved it.!
B00BEK6Z7M|2.0|Just sort of blah...I do not know whether I am tired of Preston and Child or whether they are tired of writing exciting novels. The authors of old had lengthy, intricate, exciting and gruesome novels. Except for a few torched bodies, this had none of those and the authors of old would never have simply burned people to death, even if alive. The villains were formulary and every reader knew the silver smelting was underlying the evil, long before it was revealed.<br />I have long enjoyed their novels, but unless they recapture the allure of their past efforts, I will have to pass on their next effort...with much regret.
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|White House Down Channing Tatum - This is an action packed movie with a few twists and turns.  It is in the genre of Die Hard and Zero Dark Thirty, so if you liked those movies, you will like this one.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This does not work on a desktop computer. Maybe you can get it to work if you are a 23rd degree geek. I am just a 5th degree geek, and I have been searching on Google and other sites, including appeals to the Chromecast technical experts. If I ever get it to work, I will post again. Warning! If you plan to run this on a desktop, you are in for a world of hurt.
B00E4W40C4|5.0|Get this edition of the movie!  It includes the 3D Blu-Ray theatrical cut, the Blu-Ray theatrical cut, the Blu-Ray Unleashed Extended Edition (WHICH IS THE ONE YOU WANT--This is the only way to buy it) with optional Director's commentary), The DVD theatrical cut, and a digital HD copy for your portable devices.  The extended cut is almost a different movie.  I loved both versions!<br /><br />This gemstone of a movie is a direct sequel to the deplorable Brett Ratner creation X3: X-Men United and if you wait for the credits to start a prequel of sorts to the highly anticipated X-Men Days of Future Past.  What I loved about this movie was the deep exploration of the Wolverine character who is now a haunted man--literally in the form of Jean Grey/Phoenix (Famke Janson) who is suspiciously more than just a dream character.  Having said that, in this movie Wolverine has two new women (as well as a host of Yakuza and Ninja) to play off of.  Despite all the action this remains a character driven piece and I liked the extended edition even more than the theatrical one, and I saw this movie 4 times in the theatre!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|While some of the characters are quite unlikeable, the casting is first rate.  The story is ages old: the wanderer (Anne Hathaway) comes up against an impossible being, but learns to survive and then realizes that surviving on the other party's terms is not what she wants.  And if you think fashion is shallow, though big business, this movie may confirm that.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great way to get your injustice fix on the go. Also a great way to unlock new content for your console version, and vice-versa. I highly recommend this app to injustice fans and superhero fans alike.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|This is a short story. This sucks. The end. Seriously, I have been a fan since album one. This is a slap in the face to the band's legacy. If Tom has to rely on several songs that really didn't work on the last album, to fill this album, he's in trouble.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Visually hard to tell the tiles apart and had to turn down the sound as it is very noisy and annoying.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I have enjoyed these geek boys since first they graced my TV. The show is funny, well-written, very well-acted and smart. I think we have all met someone like these characters, allowing us to relate to them as well as take them to heart.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Exactly what I look for in a weather app. Visually appealing, seems to be accurate, like the extended forcast. Thanks.
B00BATG18K|3.0|I felt it was not up to the usual Amy Tan level of writing. I have loved all of her other books.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Well written and acted show.  Great fun and one of the best series on TV.  Love the interaction between characters.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|A series you must watch from the first show to get the whole thing.  It is so captivating. It is like reading a book.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Nahhhh... is a simple game hahahaha. However, it is a very good tool to do daily mental excercise, which is good to do...
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Didn't think I would enjoy this series but wants to go to recommendation of a friend. I am so involved in the lives of the people.  I see if more stories of relationships and fighting the zombies.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A real page turner, hoping throughout for a happy ending for this unusual couple brought together by fate.  Perfect character development.
0694003611|5.0|There was no doubt that we would get this book for our daughter.<br />Now, at 14 months old, she reaches for it time and time again. She loves the pictures, the story, and loves to point out the items on the pages. And the lulling rhythm of the book is comforting and simple.<br /><br />Margaret Wise Brown is a graduate of the university I attended, so it gives me a little pride to know an alum's book is one of my daughter's favorites.
B00BEIYGK2|5.0|LOVED this movie!!  In my opinion there haven't been any good chick flicks out for a long time- either they're really crass or lacking endearment- both in regard to characters and plot.  With that in mind this movie came thru where others have fallen short.  Not only were the characters memorable and easy to root for but the plot itself was creative, funny, sweet and tear-inducing.  I especially liked how the actor who played the main character is a normal run of the mill guy- felt like someone I'd know in real life (well aside from the time traveling of course...hehe).  A definite must see!!  I highly recommend :)<br /><br />PS-  My husband went with me (gasp b/c he doesn't like chick flicks) and he even teared up at the end and said it was &#34;good&#34;... that right there carries more weight than what I wrote above ;)
B001992NUQ|5.0|Classic movie! I owned it a long time ago and it's such a cool movie that somebody stole it from me so, I got another one.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|HILARIOUS!! BOTH THUMBS UP!!! I LEAVE IT TO THE READER, AND HOPEFULLY THE VIEWER, TO DISCOVER WHAT THE TITLE MEANS!  RQ
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Wow.  I wasn't sure I would like yet another retelling of Superman, but this one was awesome.  I've never been a huge Superman fan, but this one was more comic-booky, which I prefer in a comic-book movie.  The effect, the cinematography, acting, everything was really good.
B006WMILQU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF MANSFIELD PARK I'VE SEEN! BOTH THE YOUNG ACTRESS, AND WHEN SHE GROWS UP, THE YOUNG ADULT ACTRESS DO A MAGNIFICENT JOB. I HAVE NOT YET READ THE BOOK, BUT FEEL AS IF I KNEW THE HEART OF IT!  RQ
B008JFUO72|5.0|A great follow-up to the last 3 movies (including Avengers.)  The sense of humour, the action, the armour.  Nothing but fun.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We thoroughly enjoy this show.  It has drama, romance, historical interest, intrigue, and humor...it is a &#34;complete&#34; show!<br />Husband and I both love it.
B00EAH3GHI|4.0|Really good sound quality, solid performance, and a great set.  I'm not a huge fan of their pre-In Utero sets, so this is a great show for me.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|wish there was a way to get more play tokens for free but otherwise great time passer... would recommend it to friends
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I never got to see any of these when they came out, and I didn't even know there was a third.  I wasn't sure if I would really like the series or not, as I'd only seen bits and pieces on TV.  They turned out to be really great movies.
6305428042|5.0|Came packaged and in a short time frame, I love this movie and got it as a gift so it nice to get it on time for Christmas! Pleased. :3
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The Husband 's Secret<br />A good read.  First I like the lacation which was Australia.  Second iliked how the characters intertwined.  In the end we all have some sort of secret but this was intense.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I found this book amazing, I wanted to know where Death was taking the story. It made me wonder how the average German felt at the end of the war with Hitlers demise. Was there guilt over the treatment of Jews? Was there relief that the war and suffering was over? Was there anger and hatred because Hitler was defeated? Great story, I cried bucket loads when her adopted family and friends were killed in the sir raid.
1480273228|1.0|The original story, A Christmas Carol, is wonderful.  This edition does not qualify as that.  It is choppily abridged and has no publisher information printed in it ANYWHERE nor does it indicate that it is abridged.  Upon further investigation, it is a product of a &#34;publish your own books&#34; website.  DO NOT BUY, especially if you need it for school or have any taste in literature.
B009X2CUYA|4.0|As always, Kate Morton presents a great story!<br />Always a good mix of the present & the past.<br />Great characters and storyline.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|I've thoroughly enjoyed all of the Pendergast novels and this one did not disappoint. Can't wait for the next installment!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Enjoyed watching this a second time too!  It was very entertaining watching this movie even a year later.  Very suspenseful!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a very well written book; kept me turning pages till the end!  It wrapped up well, not as I had suspected, but I loved how the author weaved the story and kept me coming back for more. I was sad to see it end.  Would highly recommend this book to anyone that loved a good story with many twists and turns.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|One thing that slightly irritates me is that this is free on any other platform.<br /><br />And the Micro-transactions, I know you have to make money, but when an app costs money, it should be the full game, not bits of it. That's the problem with modern gaming, even on consoles.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Voice similar to Holden Canfield catcher in the rye, just visited metropolitan museum so vividly related to my experience and love.  Illustrates the impact guilt and love can play in our lives .

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I've had several name brand camera backpacks and for the money this is the best yet. High quality at a very reasonable price. I was able to fit a G5 4/3rd camera with mounted 100-300, 14mm, 20mm prime, 14-42 x power lens, 45-150 x power lens, wide angle conversion, macro conversion, flash, multiple filters....etc. Each with their own protective cases. So much better than spending $185 for an expedition back pack. I have an expedition 3 and this Amazon one is perfect for fitting everything. Nice padding. For Day trips...I'll take a smaller case after selecting what I want to use. Best $25 I ever spent on camera equipment. I sprayed with waterproofing.

B004NS710C|5.0|I really liked the movie and love to watch it over and over again so I needed a copy for my personal use.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|There are 3 things I really like about this book. 1 it's written very well. 2 a unique story; the hero's (burn-there bodies are able to use) different metals to give them special abilities.  3 it allows us to consider morality without being preachy  Why is evil, evil or good always good or are they.
B00G2KV92U|2.0|Boston‘s sixth album, ‘Life, Love & Hope,’ is a rather frustrating, confusing affair JUST Boring &#34; too LOVEY DOVE DOVE !<br /><br />There are still moments — like on the chorus of the album-opening ‘Heaven on Earth’ — when the band’s trademark formula clicks into place with a perfectly infectious chorus and that famous Tom Scholz guitar tone. But that buzz rarely lasts for an entire song, and far too often what turns up instead is highly generic pop-rock filler. Obviously, part of the problem is that Scholz is trapped by his past success. He’s clearly trying to explore more diverse (and often more mellow) textures with songs like the ’80s synth-rock referencing ‘Sail Away’ or the harmonica-powered ‘Someday.’ But it’s impossible not to compare these new wrinkles to the unimpeachable template he built on the group’s first few records.<br /><br />And it’s not just the style that suffers by this measure, it’s the songwriting, the overly simplistic lyrics and even the production, which used to be the group’s calling card. Here the drums sound positively tinny, and the often unremarkable vocals — provided by a rotating cast of singers, including the late Brad Delp — are frequently too high in the mix, further burying those (still wonderful) guitars. Another problem is the scattered, unfocused nature of the record. The vocals-by-committee approach obviously contributes to this, as does the fact that several tracks on ‘Life, Love & Hope’ are reworked or remastered versions of songs from the group’s 2002 ‘Corporate America’ album. But even accounting for that, the record takes some jarring left turns, like the pace-sapping organ part that appears halfway through ‘Didn’t Mean to Fall in Love’ or the overly dramatic political rap (complete with helicopter sound effects!) that opens ‘Sail Away.’<br /><br />You can judge this album by its cover, While not compared to ‘Boston‘ and ‘Don’t Look Back”s scenes of escape and exploration, the ‘Life, Love & Hope’ artwork does rather effectively portray the image of a band that seems somewhat aimless and adrift at the moment... Fact be said there are tribute bands that could have delivered a Boston Of &#34; the once ago &#34; better than BOSTON ...s of escape and exploration, the ‘Life, Love & Hope’ artwork does rather effectively portray the image of a band that seems somewhat aimless and adrift at the moment...

B002JVWRAO|5.0|One of the best TV series out there to date. a must buy for any super natural fan. I can't wait for season six.
B00415MUWG|4.0|This is a very nice album. It doesn't seem like they are simply enjoying the music and aren't trying to prove anything. Both Kiske and Somerville can sing high, but they really don't seem to care about showing off that they can on the album.    However, it gives the music that something that makes me want to listen to it more. It's like eating at a certain kind of restaurant. Nothing fancy, but there's something wholesome about it. There's also a magical feel about the music was made. Both Kiske and Somerville have that kind of voice with the right music. Individually, they have the ability to almost take you to another place with their songs. Kiske especially was impressive in Avantasia's The Mystery of Time    One thing the CD version includes is the CD booklet with lyrics. I thought there would be better lyrics vs what you get online, however, the lyrics on Second Chance are confusing. Watch out for this
B0026ICMLY|5.0|a must buy gift set for snow white fans. a well maid product with lots of extras that collectors will enjoy.
B000000XBC|5.0|This album had lesser-known CCR hits, but it was nice for me. I got to hear fantastic CCR songs that I have never heard before. It must have been like the first time I have heard CCR. I absolutely loved the opportunity to rediscover CCR
0316017930|2.0|Starts good, then becomes boring.<br /><br />Well, I started this book very excited and kept reading the first few chapters and was enjoying it. Then, gradually I started losing interest and left the book for weeks without finishing it. I just recently got back to it to just finish it and it kept being boring. People might disagree with me, but I lost interest half way through the book. I only read it because it is on the list of my book club and I heard so many good things about it, but when I read it I thought people were exaggerating a bit.
1439102813|4.0|The book was in good shape.  The only think that was wrong with the package and the book is that they reek of smoke.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Ended up exchanging these because he wanted the electronic version, and then I ended up buying it for myself. Great series, definitely recommend.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan from the earliest days having worked at record stores pretty much my whole young adult life and met the band several times. I like the fact that they progress and mature - I don't want my favorite artists to be static. I like this CD but don't love it for no other reason than my completely subjective opinion. I'm glad I bought the CD (not digital) and will listen to it again.
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|If you're looking for a stupid comedy just to escape for a while, this could be your ticket.  Well acted with several LOL moments.

014241493X|5.0|Bought this for my daughter who is a John Green fan. She thinks all of his books are great and should be required reading in late middle school/early high school-- for parents! I find he accurately portrays teens without overdoing the angst.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love the minions game is graphically cool. I will not spend money in these games so acquiring things takes time.

B00DVPN30A|5.0|Great album, love most of the songs on here, not as good as some of his older stuff but still great
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We love the Walking Dead. When I lost all the episodes on my DVR, I had to order it from Amazon. I play it through my Roku, which works great.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|No trouble so far.  A recent download that works well.  I do not have extended experience with this tab yet.
020530902X|5.0|Every household should have a copy of Strunk & White. If you have an old copy lying around the house, it's worth getting the new 4th edition.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|This app is not a good challenge.  Winning all the games is not enjoyable.  I downloaded because I thought it would be more difficult than the one I currently have, but the only good quality is the change in graphics.
1781162646|5.0|The book was a tense, fast read. Usually King bogs down in the middle. This book never stopped. I enjoyed how Mr. King drew me in quickly and never let me go.
B00CKDYWYA|5.0|I got totally absorbed in this book.  Needed to find out whether the end would be sad or happy.  Suspense!
B009CVRQLY|4.0|Good music, not quite up to Celine's best. The songs seemed to lack some of the emotion that she put into earlier works. This lack of emotion made the music well crafted, but unexceptional.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|Dio sounds 100x better than Ozzy these days.  This is the last time Sabbath was in perfect form.  and by the way, Sabbath with Ozzy should include Bill Ward...Shame on you Sharon!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A unique book, and a unique post-apocalyptic setting. The author is not afraid to kill off a well liked character, or paint a vivid, horrible picture. Cleaning as a punishment takes on a completely new level in the Silo. The book reveals its secrets at a nice pace, always leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />The conspiracy theory and power grabbing by a group of characters was so well described, it seemed like the author has had first hand knowledge of the situation.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Great album would be an even greater album if:  They should have Mike Anthony on bass, and make Dave sing within his aging register.  He doesnt have to try to hit high notes anymore.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|cuz its awesome period. specially where the action has NO shaky cam omitting the violence like they do on most recent movies now.
B00E6NCTJ2|4.0|K I'll make this review short for a simple to the point review....it's a simple story, princess gets captured , you have to save her, they want  the princess back. See?..... Now the bad is also part of the story , they did a lot of building up as if there was going to be a fight with humans vs the giants but all it was was cat vs mouse at the end. Just when you thought the story was going to turn into ww2 things like pause and then it's the end of the movie. Yes!! They Actually get you on the edge of your couch but just stops the action with no side actually winning the war .....
0375831002|5.0|I've read it twice and about half way through the 3rd reading.  A tender story, with a unique narrator... death.
B00EVW0SA0|3.0|I had a meh average feeling towards this movie overall. You got some rookie wanting to be the presidents body guard but they pretty much tell him oh no you not good enough to be Jamie fox's body guard(president).  The problem with this movie is ummmmm it's not realistic I want give away too much but you got scenes like when the bad guys walk into the White House and starts killing security one by one as they come running around the corner. Then you have special forces on the roof looking out at the entrance hate waiting for the bad guys to what appear out in the opening but while the 3 of them are on the roof looking str8 ahead bad guy guess what? Comes behind all 3 of them and shot them all in their backs. Like wow really?  So that's my only flow with this  movie
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Cornwell never disappoints, however DUST  is definitely one of her best.  Even first-time readers will come to know Kay Scarpetta and all her main characters personally.  Great read!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|convincing, scientific yet anecdotal. Helped me be less fearful of death and death has been a lifelong phobia of mine.  I have read some quantum physics that align with some spiritual concepts and Dr. Eben supports this marriage of the two.  I like his humanity and sincerity as well as the scientific base from where he writes.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|An excellent way to have a portable alarm clock right on your Kindle Fire. The numbers are large enough to read without my glasses, and the blue light doesn't disrupt my sleep. I run Pandora on sleep mode at the same time to drift off to sleep. Excellent combination.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|This is the album with the songs preformed by the a capella groups in the film. My mother is receiving this for Christmas. She had previously bought the wrong album that has the recorded songs that play in the background of scenes. Was not happy. But this? This will make her day! Thanks!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The app is great to block other unwanted noise. It also helps me to relax. You can also mix the sounds.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's so easy to be obsessed with this game!!! I love playing on my kindle...everything is so much bigger and accessible. I have this game both on my phone and kindle for extra fun. I did have problems with freezing up during games...luckily I've always been refunded anything that was lost.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The set up of the narrator (spoiler alert) as the grim reaper intrigued me, I then grew tired of him, and finally I forgot who the narrator was I became lost in the story. A great read for all people of all ages. This work humanizes all of those--including Germans and Jews-- who suffered at the hands of the Nazi terrorists.
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|Great price. I'm a Bruce Willis fan and the move was full of action. I've seen all the Die Hard movies
B00E9A656K|5.0|ok this game is sweet, very clean and addicting, im workin my tail off in multiplayer to make rep and cash for cars. if you like straight up head to head racing and building cars this the game for you.
B00FF9SKSK|5.0|R I P Paul Walker. I have first 5 fast and furious movies, I cannot wait to get this movie. I will be watching it now with a tear in eye my with the lost of paul walker.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read the Gregor series as well, love the style of writing and character development but (Spoiler alert) a bit of a quick kill-off for a lot of characters with a few chapters left...a bit of an abrupt ending.
B00GLX1MG6|5.0|loved it - funny and Jennifer Anniston is wonderful, cute and what a good actor she has become -stupid plot but the characters are very believing and helps he movies move along - if  you haven't seen it go...was great!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great idea. but stopped working after 2 months...google support gave run around and hence finally trashed. Google should have made exchanges process little easier.
B00GX59QO2|3.0|wasn't as good as the first one-Bruce Willis was great - so was the rest of the cast -Helen Mirren class act - the action was there but it just the same - Bruce Willis's girl friend in the movie is so stupid (don't think anyone in real life is that stupid) that it sort of belittled her character
B00G3Q6VPS|3.0|An average item for a pop star in the twilight of her great career. It is better than her albums while she was married to K Fed but not better than her early albums or the last 2. Worth listening to but not buying till it drops in price in about a month. Plus, deluxe version is not autorip but standard version is. Come on Amazon.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|this movie was great - alot of action - comedy and fun<br />highly recommend it - great actors and plot line was good
B000002KDS|5.0|The best Alice Cooper album ever recorded.The band was at its highest point at this time in history. Get it now.
B001TKD4ZI|5.0|was a very good funny book about vampires and his duties<br />short book was very easy to read<br />finished within two hours<br />recomment it if you are looking for something different and fun
B005C9YZIM|5.0|Incredible visuals as you've never seen before, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, who practically built the theme of nature shows over his many years.  His historical/biological background bring you right into focus with the plants, animals, and insects of our world. Must see. Must have. So detailed it bears watching many times. The behind the scenes at the end of each episodes give one an appreciation of the cameramen and camerawomen as well as the teams of people who helped this spectacle come to life.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|was better than I thought it was going to be - how many white house kidnapping the president movies this year are coming out - Jamie Foxx was better than I thought - he did a great good as president - funny - alot of action - Channing Tatum is so hot but has such a soft voice that it is hard to see him as a action hero but the  body helps<br />see the movie
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Although heartbreaking and emotional,  I feel that the author did justice to human thoughts and tragedy in this novel. I laughed and cried right along with the characters. I found myself wondering what i would do in their situation. Fantastic!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was a touching story of love and compassion in war torn Germany as told by Death. The surprising way the author unfolded this tale was original and compelling. It managed to touch my heart.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Love this series.....bought for my Mom as she requested for x-mas. We both like the humor and mystery that this show offers
B008JFUN6E|2.0|Not a big fan of Matt Damon but he's surprised me before so I decided to give this movie a try. His acting was decent but this movie just didn't excite me in any way. It was unfortunately quite predictable and overall, unentertaining.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|If you have watched Dexter up until now....the final season. You are probably already a fan of the series.  Sad to see the show go, but I think they ended the series well.  No spoilers here....you'll either love it or hate it!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|better quality materials than expected for the price, sturdy, and you can throw this in a bag and take it with you- it is put together/taken apart in seconds
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|I can't say much more than that this is one of the greatest special/collector 's edition sets of all time. The barrel disc container is beautiful, the Blu-Ray is absolutely stunning, the Los Pollos Hermanos apron is hilariously awesome, the challenge coin is too badass, and the bonus features let you see Breaking Bad from an entirely different angle. This is the ultimate fan collection.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|I used to think westerns and SciFi shows were lame.<br /> I then sat myself  down and watched Firefly, and<br />now the world makes sense to me. Thanks!
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I love this movie...I've watched it again and again.  Beautifully acted, lovely scenes.  I enjoy it every time I watch it.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|I have only walked out on less than a handful of movies in my lifetime, and this was one of them.  Boring.
0307887448|5.0|Okay, folks, I want you to understand that I gave this book 5 stars for a reason; it's an awesome book. Really. I enjoyed every page and I barely put it down. That being said, I'm going to distinguish myself from those reviews that say &#34;IT's Great!!&#34; and leave it there, and that means pointing out the good and the bad. Here goes:<br />1. The premise is pretty cool and (I think) original.<br />2. The first few chapters are a little dry and there is a LOT of exposition. The exposition is important, though, and it really isn't boring, just dry.<br />3. The 80's trivia, Oh Gods, the 80's trivia. It's everywhere, and for the most part it's awesome and hilarious. There are moments where you will find yourself saying, &#34;OK, I get it, you know a lot of trivia, move along&#34; or &#34;It's not necessary to go as far as the game's programmer's brother's son's goldfish's middle name to prove that you know what you're talking about&#34; but for the most part, you'll just laugh or be proud of yourself if you get the reference.<br />4. The middle 3/5's of the book move pretty quickly with a lot of stuff explained away or just happening &#34;between the panels&#34;, but it's stuff that would have made long and boring chapters to explain anyway, so I don't know why people complain about that.<br />And that's about it, really, except to say that I would recommend to anyone who considers themselves a nerd of any kind. Very enjoyable.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|This CD is definitely filled with great songs, however it isn't as awe inspiring as Sasha Fierce, for me at least. It came promptly, in great condition and ready to be played on repeat in the car.
B002MFULQO|5.0|Good Movie,<br />We highly recommend it to anyone who wants to visually experience such a tragic event in our history.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is great fun for the whole family.  I bought this for my grand daughter for Christmas.  I know she will love it as much as I  do.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I love her voice and style.  Can't wait until she releases another album, one that I hope will include her single for Skyfall.
0345803507|5.0|This is the best Trilogy out there!  I cannot wait for the movie to come out.  I think I may just re-read the trilogy again :)
B002VECM6S|5.0|I love this movie, as much, as my father does... And it is my X- Mas present for my father... It arrived in great condition, and It's going to make one less present to purchase... That is going to make someone very happy...
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and when I don't have a computer handy this app works wonderfully on my tablet!  I love looking for recipes and can pull them right up as I am cooking.
B001GCUO16|4.0|This is a good movie plenty of action scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I am definitely looking for to reading the next book.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|This is a good movie plenty of action scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is the best I have played on my tablet. I highly recommend this game to everyone interested in a hunting game.
B00GLX1MG6|4.0|This is a good movie plenty of funny scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B000SGGUWS|3.0|This book was very good love it so much I can not wait to read the other books and can't wait for will happen
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is a good movie plenty of action scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B00E9A656K|5.0|I think that this game I awesome. It is a great way to drag race. It is kind of like drag racing the game, but better. You have to get this app.
B009MO5E10|4.0|This is a good movie plenty of action scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B00AEFY6ZQ|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and I lost it in the move so I bought this one and I love it! It works great(:
B008JFUOVI|5.0|This is a good movie plenty of funny scenes and good story line behind it. i would recomend to anyone
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is an unparalled story teller. Here she has constructed a modern day Dickensian fable, a dark David Copperfield-like protagonist with a little Oliver Twist and Artful Dodger thrown in..
B000WCDBKM|5.0|Great movie, kept you on your toes throughout and ended with an unexpected result. Fun to watch. I would recommend it to everyone.
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani's book, DYING TO ME tells the real-life story of how Anita Moorjani died of cancer… and then came back to life after an amazing near-death experience in which she realized she could be well simply by dropping all her fears and simply being herself. Despite a loving family and friends, and the best efforts of medical staff and educating herself to reduce stress and live a healthier life, Moorjani found herself in a terrifying downward spiral toward listlessness and probable death.<br /><br />I love the way Moorjani describes the feeling of pure unconditional divine love she felt–pure agape–and the sense of fearlessness and Oneness she experienced from a state of consciousness that allowed her to watch everything unfolding on Earth… as well as see what was transpiring in the emergency room where doctors were doing everything they could to save her malnourished, cancer-ravished body.<br /><br />This book doesn’t just tell a story about overcoming cancer–it’s really about attaining prosperity and abundance and blessings by letting go of fears and moving into a state of allowing as you are fully 100% yourself. This is a book you’ll likely want to get more than one copy of, so you can loan and give copies away… it’s that good!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 7 year old says &quot;it's the best, I love it!&quot; The horse is very lifelike and fun to show.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush Saga,is addicting!! Awesome game!! As you play,you get to different levels,and are able to help out your family and friends achieve their goals,is great!!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book finished the series perfectly in my opinion, with quite a few pleasant surprises.  I will continue to read Brandon Sanderson's other books in the future after the skill shown with finishing the WoT.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This is a beautiful, sad, but also deeply moving film. Jennifer Lawrence's performance is fantastic and even though the film has an over-all bleak feel, I didn't come away from it feeling depressed or hopeless. I would watch it again.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|It does what it claims to do. Sometimes the password reset doesn't work smoothly, but there are ways to get around this.
B00H1O47D4|1.0|The HD delivery quality was terrible.  Constant laggy playback, waits and buffering.  I am on a metered 15mbps guaranteed pipe, so no chance it was on my end.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Prime and usually have no issues, ironically with the included content.  Being my first experience with purchasing content from Prime, it might be my last.<br /><br />While hard goods purchases are fully support with refunds, there seems to be no way to indicate a digital order as unsatisfactory.<br /><br />This review is no reflection on the Walking Dead, which is a favorite show and quality content.
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom H4N is a top portable recorder. It has an exellent sound quality and is very easy to use. I recomend to every musician. Perfect for capturing voice.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|If you are a Pentatonix fan, you won't be disappointed.  If you aren't, you will be after hearing this collection.  The Deluxe Edition is PTXmas with 2 additional songs, including Little Drummer Boy, which has gone viral on YouTube.  This group of songs features each of the group's talented vocalists.  I highly recommend it as an addition to your Christmas music collection.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The story is well written and the plot twists in ways you will not predict.  Super book for vacation!  Enjoy!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I agree with many of the other reviewers.  The action seems to end abruptly with an unsatisfactory resolution.  Katniss spends too much time sitting out of the main plot development.  I was okay with the actual ending, but I felt the book was a let down compared with the other two in the series.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Barbara Streisand.  Can I say more? Saw her last year at the Hollywood Bowl, the very first time.  She was wonderful and funny and entertaining.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This is the BEST APP EVER!!!!!  I can get all Ny face photos on this app and save them tto my gallery. Thus is a total suggested app. It works really fast ut has amazing graphics and I love it!!! I give ut a 5 out of 5
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Good story in the tradition of the spy genre. Nice tribute to both Fleming and Bond. Interesting and fun to read. Some of the  hand-to-hand combat was a bit difficult to believe. Overall very good.
B008602KQI|4.0|I don't usually like the movie if I've read the book first but I have to say this wasn't a bad movie.  It did follow the storyline of the books.  More than most movies have.
B00CNQ7G5G|5.0|As a retired performer/musicologist this is the most interesting book on the subject that I can remember reading; Wonderfully researched and written from the author's personal experience.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of my favorite families.  If you want to have a good laugh this is the movie to buy.  My daughter who doesn't like older movies actually sat down and watched it twice with me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|might be even a tad bit better than the first! makes you think that you're in the very middle of the action...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the book, movie was very close - Jennifer Lawernce was perfect as Kat I can't wait to see the next movies
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|I'm totally shocked at how Scholz continues to regress as a producer.  It's kind of like he's done things completely backwards from what you'd expect -- his debut was immaculately produced, Don't Look Back was fine, then each album from there has been progressively worse.  Bringing us to the latest release, which, unfortunately, sounds like a demo recorded years ago with cheap equipment.<br /><br />The drum (machine) sound is amazingly artificial sounding.  I'm not a fan of drum machines in general, but from a tone perspective, they have gotten much better over the years.  Not here.  Even by mid-1980s drum machine standards, this sounds bad.  Really bad.<br /><br />The rest of the mix isn't much better.  The thick, lush guitar sound is gone.  This would be okay if it were replaced with something decent, but it wasn't.  The overall mix is one-dimensional.  Gone is the wide, room filling production, with nothing compelling put in it's place.<br /><br />I certainly don't fault Scholz for not re-creating what he's done in the past.  But there still the expectation that it should sound decent.<br /><br />On the bright side, some of the songs are structurally pretty good.  Unfortunately for me, I have a hard time thinking I'll be able to get past the way it sounds.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Quick, welll written book that pulls you into the story quickly and never lets you go...loved it!  Looking for more from Jojo Moyes
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|I was ready to give this a glowing review...I installed it and played it for a few minutes and was very pleased. It worked without having WiFi on, virus and malware scanners reported no issues...<br />but then...after I exited the game, it was still running in the background.<br />If an app has an exit button or a &#34;Do you want to quit&#34; window but doesn't actually quit...that's a security issue. Why is it still running even after it's made you think you exited the program?<br /><br />It's been uninstalled. No amount of fun (and the game was fun) is worth taking a chance with your privacy and security.<br /><br />Based on the few minutes I played, if the author fixed these permissions and the still-running-after-quit issue...I'd say the game is worth the $1.99 regular price. But even a FAOTD isn't worth it if it's putting your private information at risk.
0316001821|5.0|I love the way this story is told in the first person narrative by a person already deceased.  A unique perspective.  The characters are so well drawn and the story is so far superior to the movie as there just are so many nuances that failed to make it to the film.  I heartily recommend this book.
B008469DGY|1.0|I was ready to give this a glowing review...I got this quite some time ago as a FAOTD and played it fairly often. It worked without having WiFi on, virus and malware scanners reported no issues...and it was a good-looking, fun game.<br />But then I noticed that after I exited the game, it was still running in the background.<br />And then I noticed that the processes running in the background would try to access network information once the tablet connected again!<br /><br />If an app has an exit button or a &#34;Do you want to quit&#34; window but doesn't actually quit...that's a security issue. Why is it still running even after it's made you think you exited the program?<br />That this behavior is happening in a PAID app makes it even worse. (It makes it inexcusable in my book.)<br /><br />It's been uninstalled. No amount of fun (and the game was fun) is worth taking a chance with your privacy and security.
6305428352|5.0|This movie is about Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss), a man with musical talent who works as a cocktail lounge pianist while dreaming of creating a world-class symphony.  He does not earn enough money to continue supporting himself and his wife Iris (Glenne Headly) in this manner, transitions into survival mode and takes a job as a high school music teacher under the guidance and encouragement of a female principal (Olympia Dukakis).  He plunges into his new job with courage and determination, but without previous teaching experience.  This shortfall soon becomes obvious as he forcefully tries to impart music theory into his student's minds with lectures plus question and answer sessions and perfect their performance techniques with classical music drills based on trial and error.  These methods create tension and boredom among his students along with loss of faith in their instructor.  Mr. Holland realizes that he is going down the wrong road and the students are not having fun.  He scraps his failing methods and begins to use rock music examples to illustrate the points he needs to make.  His students light up, start smiling, digging in and catching on.  During the buildup to the movie's end, Mr. Holland continues to compose and eventually finishes the symphony he always wanted to create.  The movie plays down Mr. Holland's work on the symphony, leaving the audience free to forget about it as other events distract the audience.  The audience also is distracted, saddened and irritated by seemingly irrelevant material placed before the movie's end to condition them for the final uplift.  The final scene is a huge reunion involving Mr. Holland and the music students who were taught by him over a thirty-year interval.  It includes a stirring first performance of his symphony.  The result is dramatic enough to drive reasonably sensitive members of the audience into huge spasms of tearful joy.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Written from the perspective of the death angel, this book about the Nazi Germany of the common people will, no doubt, spawn many lively discussions.  I felt the writing was simple, but compelling.  I generally avoid this kind of story because the horror and sadness leave me blue for days.  However, Zusak did a good job of showing the humanity of the people behind the goose-stepping stereotype. When everything was said and done, I would've liked to have heard a bit more from the death angel about the God he serves.  Without that, the book seems to have nothing underneath.
B009MO5ES8|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time. The entire movie is a kid biking through NYC with some dirty cop chasing him. That's it, the whole enchilada. All dialogue and character development is supposed to support the action, but it doesn't work. If you have a functioning brain, you will be bored after 10 minutes.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Brilliant! Loved it, still play it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I chose this book because of it being a continuation of \\" A Time to Kill\\". I have never read the book but saw the movie many times. It is one of my favorites. I love having the character visuals in my head already there from the movie. I must now read this book. Sycamore Row did not disappoint me. It's an easy read because it ,being typical of John Grisham, makes you feel as though you are a fly on the wall in the same breathing space as all the characters he creates so well. Thank you Mr. Grisham for sharing this with me. You have inspired me to read more. I highly recommend this great ride.
B00AALX5SI|3.0|The movie is entertaining and keeps moving.  This was not my normal movie choice but I did enjoy the show.  No story line to speak of except one big tour.
0757302661|5.0|Strategies for a natural birth that got me through 2 ten plus hour labors.  What else needs to be said!  Make sure you get the CD.  That is the best part of the whole thing.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|As of 12/2/2013 It's just not that useful. I already have a couple devices that do Youtube, and Netflix. I tried to stream Amazon Prime to it, but it requires a far more powerful computer than my laptop to do so. The potential is there, but until they have more apps then it's just not that useful.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|AMAZING FILM! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! One of Tom Hardy's best. There is some full frontal Hardy in it. I call that a bonus!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|initially bought it for my daughter but I play it after she goes to bed lol it's great!!! get it!
B00095NX9G|5.0|I really enjoy the yoga portion.  It ensures that your muscles are fully warmed and stretched before moving on the the dance portion.
0765365278|5.0|One of the best new fantasy books to hit the market.  I can't wait for the next in the series!
B00BAXFACO|5.0|Another &#34;over the fence literary homerun&#34; by Mr. Connelly!!  WOW!  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  I have read every book he has written about Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller, and I can't wait until the next one... please don't wait too long to write another one.  LOL  I have always said (for me at least) that one of the best measures of a book is whether or not I can put it down and not miss it ... OR ... whether I can't wait to get back to reading it!  And on this book, I could not put it down.  And when I did for brief moments, I thought about it, and couldn't wait to get back.  I preordered it, and I had it read before the end of the day after I received it electronically on my i-Pad Kindle App.<br /><br />The book had interesting characters, and the protagonist (good ole Lincoln Lawyer Mickey &#34;Mantle&#34; Haller himself) was better than ever.  He was fired up at times, romantic with a new girl, made a few legal mistakes, but in the end he delivered the goods and did what he was paid in gold (literally) to do as a lawyer.<br /><br />The book kept you interested, the plot was intriguing, and the end was not expected.  Wait until you see what happens in the court room!  Sure, I hate to see crooked cops do their crooked stuff, but there are some out there who do.  Well, 'ole Mickey will have nothing to do with that garbage.  I loved this book, gave it 5 stars, and you will like it, too.
B00GX50ZC4|4.0|Necessary oversimplification of the real story, but I really liked Ashton Kutcher's portrayal of Steve Jobs.  Kutcher really seemed to get into Jobs' character.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved this one. From start to finish. Classic Grisham  some times  you cannot put a book down.  This is one of those stories.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this story.  I like books.  I enjoy mysteries.  And I don't like murder and care chases.  This is my kind of read.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|love this game. wish you didn't have to pay for stuff but other wise it's fun. add people it gives u stuff.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't even know where to start....this book let me down in so many ways.  I feel betrayed.  How could you do this?  Seriously!  How could you do this?  I think you should rewrite it.  People don't always need happy endings, but I'm dumbstruck.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I am a true Reacher creature and am reading through the series for the first time!  Can't seem to get enough of Jack Reacher and his adventures!  Bad Luck and Trouble was exciting from cover to cover!  Lee Child is an exceptional writer.  I would love for this book to be made into a movie as long as Tom Cruise does not play Reacher this time!!!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Spoilers...<br /><br />Okay, so the whovian doesn't really need to watch the doctor retrospectives.  Don't get me wrong, they where well done, but required?  Hmmm.  The day of the doctor is really cool though!  I enjoyed it immensely!
B001HLZMUE|1.0|I thought I was ordering the CD and got a download. I Can only use the download on my PC.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Love the game...super addicted to it but getting to the point where I will need to spend money to advance and I refuse to pay...I will delete the game before spending money.  I would make pearls easier to instead of having to spend money...like maybe trading coins or algae for pearls...cute game though!
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is perfect for quick pins and to see what's new. I check Pinterest about once a week and this allows me to check up on the new things very quickly.
B00G8MU0WC|1.0|it is stupid a total waste of time as it is a prank that deserves more thought to produce.  as a prank I would give it a minus 12
B008469DGY|5.0|This app reminds me of a 1990s mini table game that I used to play by using my fingers to launch a mini basketball into a mini net. Perhaps it's because like that mini table game, with this game you must also use your fingers.<br /><br />Overall, I have no complaints about this finger flicking app. It's nice to be able to play golf with your fingers, especially in such a beautifully rendered environment. This game is both challenging, and fun; it  isn't overly easy and it doesn't get boring too quickly.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|Adventurous game easy to follow two endings to choose from.  Half way thru game then it Costs 4.99  to finish.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Interesting look at a book-loving culture coming to grips with modern technology. Loved the juxtaposition of incredibly bright, technology-savvy young people and older people steeped in a traditional mode of constant learning.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|keeps me entertained. hard to put down after I started playing it. only down fall right now is not enough money and oil starting out.
0140177396|5.0|Classic American Novel by one of the greatest authors of all time. Of Mice and Men is a perfect illustration of &#34;life&#34;.<br />Steinbeck introduce George, a guy with no dream but intelligent and Lennie, mentally dumb but have a lots of dream. This odd couple travel together and made their way to their dream step by step. However, a tragic end is fated and inevitable. Even the best plan can rumble. This is the reality of life.<br />The ending is one of the best i ever read. It creates a lingering sadness in my mind. The novel contains many daily, realistic detail, describing the best portrays of life and feeling.<br />It is a very sad story. It definitely is on my favorite book list. I come to enjoy when studying ESOL class.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|From the start the reader is plunged into the insecure world that plays out in the state run childcare system. Through the eyes of one child's experience whose journey is determined by the actions and perceptions of others. This theme is given a fairy tale twist when the world of flowers serve as a path to communication, knowlege, understanding and love. A most intriguing book where I found hidden troves of information, definitely worth the read.
B00B5HQL50|2.0|Bond is ageless...until now. Did not care for the underlying theme that he was &#34;over the hill.&#34; It's never been an issue for the wily, resourceful 007 (remember Sean Connery?). Why do it?

B005IQZB14|1.0|I wanted to like this book.  I was rooting for her.  But in the end, I was just disappointed in her and her book overall.  I wanted her to fight--fight for her marriage, fight for herself.  I appreciate that she was brutally honest about her trials, but there comes a point where you want to yell at her to pull herself up by her bootstraps and buck up, girl!  I'm not trying to belittle what she went through--as I'm sure the death of her mother was incredibly difficult and not at all something I can begin to understand.  That said, is it an excuse for her to leave her husband?  To go sleep around and use heroin?  Sigh.  I just wanted her to get her crap together.  I think her fairytale of leaving her husband to hike the Pacific Crest Trail because it's something she just HAD to do to \\"find herself\\" or whatever is a bunch of crap.  I felt like I was reading Eat, Pray, Love all over again.  Life is hard.  Marriage is hard.  You don't just give up.  More of my thoughts on this growing trend of women feeling \\"trapped\\" in their marriages and leaving their husbands and how that has affected me on my blog:  [...]
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the challenge of this game.  One deck is fun but I prefer using one red and one black.  It is frustrating at times but that is the fun of it!!  This game makes you think.  Once I started playing this game I stopped playing the conventional solitaire.
0143038419|1.0|I completely agree with several of the other one star reviews of this book.  Unfortunately, it's taken me a few years to come to this opinion, as I admittedly fell into the trap that so many other women did when first reading this.  I was distracted by the glitz and glamour of her travel, and I had a naive and immature view of marriage and commitment at that time.  A relationship is not about self-actualization, self-discovery, or self-indulgence.  It’s about selflessness.  If you're interested in more of my thoughts on this book and the larger trend of women leaving their husbands to \\"find themselves,\\" I've written a post on my blog called \\"Eat, Pray, Leave Your Husband.\\"  You can find it here:  [...]

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham does it all again, great characters, good story, highly recommended.<br />It was tough to put it down. Look forward to his next effort.

B009IU6BIS|4.0|A hilarious Christmas movie that has now become a tradition each year to watch.<br />Chevy Chase is at his best in this movie.
B004G6009U|5.0|I didn't watch this movie for ever after it came out thinkin  it would be another fairytale story. Same thing with different names... no.... I finally watched it while on vacation, came home an  immediately saved it to my tv for my kids. We, I promise, watch this movie at the very least.... 3-5x a day while they play or when I'm cooking or whatever. My son wants everything Flynn an  my daughter want  everything  rapunzel. I have made my daughters  Christmas themed all the  way around this movie. I got her the life size.rapunzel Barbie, all the Disney dolls from each character in the  movie and plz don't forget Pascal and maximus!!! They are just as loved as  the rest and I got her  life size Pascal to go with her rapunzel dress and a giant maximus to go with her dolls.  This  movie Is  hilarious and my whole family.enjoys is so much.... a MUST BUY for any age, any gender :)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Everyone should read books written by John Grisham.  His stories style is more than just stories.  They have life, events one can relate if not have knowledge of.  Always evolving, attention keeper,and some form of history or educational facts included.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good book. I though  the book was a little slow at first but became very suspenseful at the end and I can't wait for the movie!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Great characters, no profanity, sex, violence - just a study of the human condition that represents all of us - in a different time period.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This game is fun and addictive. It's similar to other Facebook games where you collect things and complete missions. You get coins that you use for everything, plus dollars that you can use to speed up things or buy special items. Like other Facebook games, the dollars can be slow to earn, and missions can take an awful amount of time to complete. Unlike other Facebook games, while you can add friends to your game, you don't have to. There's no going to 25 friends and feeding their dinosaurs before you can expand a section, build a workshop, or any of those other silly things some games make you do. There's always more to do, including evolving your dinosaurs, and exploring both the aquatic and glacier parks. The only thing I have against it is that it doesn't tell you ahead of time how much it will cost to evolve your dinosaurs.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|As far as stories go; disney fell short with frozen. But the production of the musical numbers and folding them into the story was excellent. I listened to this soundtrack with my kids and could see the movie unfolding in my head along with the music. The deluxe edition includes songs that were experiments or cut from the movie that have so much additional flavor that I can't see saving a couple bucks for the non deluxe edition to be a smart move.<br /><br />All that said.... I would have bought this just to have Idina Menzel's performance of 'Let it go'.
B00E9ZATTY|3.0|We watched it once, but it was not quite as good as the first one, in our opinion. A great movie to rent.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I know I should rate all the books separately, based on their own merits, but I really struggle to do that, because in the scheme of things, each book has a job to do, and I think they all accomplish their purpose. The only negative I would say about it was that Katniss seemed the least lucid. Of course, this is purposeful, but the blacking out device did seem a little overused. Not enough me for me to dock any stars though. I would say this one was the most suspenseful of the three, maybe others would disagree, but it had so many twists and turns that my head was spinning. And just when the ending was beginning to feel anti-climactic, Collins brilliantly reveals something (many somethings) that blindsided me. Never...saw...it...coming. Though a little detail, I love when I'm discovering something at the same instant the character is, a connection, that if, it was not spelled out for me, I don't think I would have ever realized.  That is what I love about reading, and those are the nuances that differentiate the excellent writers from the middle-of-the pack.  I know the Hunger Games hype is high, and probably will be for a while as the second movie, and two more come out. But years down the road, when the coal dust has settled and the hovercraft have landed, I believe this trilogy will still be making its mark, generation after generation.
B005LAII4E|5.0|I love action movies, especially when I'm working out on my treadmill.  I get so engrossed in the film that sometimes it feels like I'm part of it!  The exercise time is up before I even realize it!  To me both GI Joe movies were awesome and the actors weren't hard to look at, either!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best books stay with you a while.  I would like to write this review both as a heads up to Christians and to writers. It took me a while to climb aboard the Hunger Games phenom. I was not sure, as a Christian, if these were books I should even read, given the theme. It took a lot of listening and learning before I felt I should give them a chance.  I admit I watched the movie first, only recently. I was so impressed with how the subject matter was handled that I knew I would have to read the series. I think a lot of the discussion among the Christian community, is that since they are books for young adults, should you allow your teen to read the books or watch the movies? Since I have only elementary children in my household, I would have a hard time judging that, though I think i would probably make mine wait until late high school/college age (which is what I would consider young adulthood anyway, but often this segment does mix in with the teen demo as well). There is little or no language in the books, and no sexual references, though (SPOILER ALERT) in the second book, there is a lot of them sleeping in the same bed together, to ward off nightmares. However, the violence is pretty intense in all three. As to writers, I think every writer should read these books. To me, they are a perfect template on how to create plot, characters, and inner and outer conflict. Let me also say, that this is not a genre I normally gravitate to. It seems to me that the dystopian society storyline has been done to death, but Collins gives such a fresh spin that it feels brand new.  It was obvious to me that this author planned very carefully, not on just the character arc in this novel, but the overall arc in the next two.  The universal themes are what I believe will make these books timeless, and future classics. This is the reason they have been so successful, because you root for the characters despite overwhelming odds, because the characters can't stay the same after horrifying circumstances and so you learn and grow and ache with and for them. Isn't that the whole reason we read anyway? They are fast-paced, and I could not put them down. Though I thought the movie was very well done, and followed the plot closely, the books are better. I understood a lot more after reading this one, things that were not as clear to me in the movie, though I think the film makers probably guessed that many of its moviegoers had read the books. Yes, the theme is disturbing, but it has to be to make a point, and yet the author never deliberately makes one. She allows the character's turmoil (inner and outer) to make it. And that is writing at its best.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Wasn't sure about his one, but once my daughter sat and made we watch, I have watched it numerous times.  Even have found myself singing along with so many songs that I didn't know.  Great family fun movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am writing this review, having not seen the second movie yet. I say that because I watched the first movie, before I read the first book, so I knew a lot of what would happen in Book One. So Book Two, for me, was a bit of a treat because I didn't know where it was headed. I have heard differing opinions as to whether this one or the third are the weakest of the three, but I think if you examine the overall story arc, they all have their strong points.  The Hunger Games: Book One was so intense, and I read this one right after (it might be a different experience if you read the first and were waiting for this one to be released) that I needed some down time, some breathing space, to process everything that happened to Katniss in Book One. Collins gives the reader that in the first half of this book. But halfway through, the action ramps up and it is Book One Reloaded. And then the ending leads right into Book Three. Again, I'm glad I had the opportunity to read them altogether, because waiting for Mockingjay's release would have been torturous. I will say, for hesitant parents (I also mentioned this in my review of Book One) that this book in the series has a lot of Katniss and I won't say which boy, sleeping in bed (and that's all) together, because of her nightmares.  I marvelled at the way the author develops very distinct characters in a cast of many, and excellent plot developments that further complicate Katniss' heroism in the first book.  She continues to grow and change, to prepare us for Book Three. I don't think it is quite fair to down rate any of these books individually, since they were meant to be a trilogy. And though I think the author does a fantastic job of allowing each book the capability to stand on its own, if she is doing her job right, you won't want to read them as stand-alones.  I would say the book failed if I lost interest and could care less about reading the final book, but since that wasn't even close to happening, I say Book Two absolutely I did what it was supposed to.olutely I did what it was supposed to.
B008NA2JMQ|2.0|I just didnt like this book at all in fact didnt finish it , I cannot be bothered with all the coarse language even if it was the way Belfort carried on, not a book for me

B00594XOZU|3.0|So they deleted kik from the Amazon app store. :( worst decision that they could have ever made . It was gone for like a month and now it's back !^,^ but it's not as fast as it use to be, in fact it's pretty slow, but not that slow. One of the things that I don't like about it now is that I can't see who I'm talking to, like it won't even load there profile picture , so that's really confusing when it comes to group chats. They need to fix that. Other than that I'm happy that they brought  it back . I was sooooo bored when they took it off the app store.

B005R32L66|3.0|Not bad for text chat, but for the tablet I have, it's not very good with video.  Sorry, but optimizations needed, and having to use an app store to run it is bloody annoying.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AMAZING!  You can build worlds on survival or creative.  In survival, you start with absolutely nothing but your hands.  In this mode you need to, as many Minecraft players say, &quot;smack a tree&quot;.  From there you will need a sword for better self defense, and a pickaxe to mine out some stone.  In order to do this you need a crafting table and some sticks. At this point you can get to upgrade old tools and create new ones.  There are several ores to mine, like coal, iron, gold(which is worse than wood), the most powerful and probably most well known ore in minecraft, diamonds, and redstone(which you cannot mine in Pocket Edition).  There are also mobs which vary from chickens(which are harmless) to zombies to spiders and Creepers(the most infamous mob in any edition of Minecraft), which are only avoidable by going to bed every night.  Next, there is creative mode, where you get everything...almost.  there are a few items that are unobtainable, and the only available tools in this mode are the bow, sword, and hoe(the kind you till land with).  It is never night, and hostile mobs never spawn.  This mode is perfect for shaping your world by your hands without interference. While this most certainly is NOT the best edition of Minecraft(computer edition is!), it most certainly is the cheapest and also has a free demo mode for those who can't cough up the $8 required to purchase the full version.  Even for seasoned fans of other minecraft versions, this is an amazing game you CANNOT pass up!  For things that better enhance the gameplay of Minecraft, get patch management apps like BlockLauncher.

1589946634|5.0|An incredible game with interesting mechanics, fast play, and lots of &#34;oh, crap&#34; moments.  I've played one solo game and several more games with 3-5 players.  I have yet to win once, and keep coming back for more.<br /><br />The game is extremely difficult to master--too often my friends and I have made it to the final room only to fall under new hordes of Genestealers.  Still, the game is nail-biting.  You'll find yourself afraid to throw the dice, so easily can your Space Marines be slain.  The rules can take some getting used to, but once you've grasped them they make perfect sense for the world of SPACE HULK.<br /><br />I always wanted to play the original Space Hulk minis game when it was in print--this has finally allowed me to get the same kicks for a much smaller price tag.  I now own all the expansions and expect to be playing this for a long time to come.<br /><br />The option to play solo (which, as some reviewers have stated, can be more fun than with friends!) is extremely rewarding.  Makes me wish more games included options like it.

B008I34ZFW|2.0|I was disappointed with this one, watch it on NETFLICKS before you decide to add it to your collection. I guess I found the humor predictable and the storyline in 2d but it had its amusing moments.

B008JFUUQ2|4.0|Basically a college version of Glee on film. I have been in not quite such a competitive choir situation as this but not too different. It is a very funny film and I enjoy the music much the I have the music and background music on my iPod. Anna Kendrick is outstanding and all the actors are gray since they all must sing the real songs. Buy it, enjoy it, and let others watch it. It is funny, enjoyable, and well written and produced.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Guess it's ok.  I don't visit it much from my Kindle....my grandkids do when they come to visit.  I do play some of the Facebook games on my kindle but don't always log into Facebook.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I always love how Star Trek makes referrals way back to the original series many moons ago.This one keeps referring to Kahn from the original series and a few films back. I am not a Trekkie but very much enjoy the films. This is worth owning and viewing more than a few times.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Fun game, but there a few issues:1) I have the newest model Kindle Fire HD, and it can barely handle running this app. There is a lot of slowdown during special moves and tagging in another fighter. At times the slowdown is so bad, you can and will lose matches because of it.2) The game tries too hard to push you to pay for additional content, and the game itself suffers for it. You only start with a couple of fighters, and the rest are locked and have to be bought through in game currency, which either can be slowly earned through battles, or bought with real money.3) This app demands alot of memory to run, and you will find yourself deleting copious amounts of data just to install this thing.<br />  On the upside, the graphics are amazing, the gameplay fast and furious, and you can unlock content on the home console versions, including the Batman Beyond costume.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|I great film that I have already seen more than once. I am a big fan of Denzel and very much enjoyed his performance. All of the actors did a fine job with the story line. As usual, Denzel is great and the white boy is too. This is worth the few bucks to purchase.

B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|OK, I just finished the Kindle/Audible (Using Whispersync for Voice) of Steelheart.  Still in the post ending high of having gone through the climax.  My immediate reaction is to love the book.  The characters are interesting and distinctive.  The characters aren't super deep (this is genre fiction), but deep enough to give them a tangible feel.  I found the main character easy to relate to, which is important in a first person POV.  The action scenes were exciting, believable (as opposed to realistic, which they aren't and shouldn't be), and very personal from David's perspective.  Sanderson did an excellent job of getting into his head in tense action scenes in a way that didn't slow the scenes down, but just drew me in further.  The story pulls you along.  I devoured the book in a couple of days (which for me is really fast, I have 3 kids).  When I wasn't reading, I wanted to be.  Good plot twists (which I always felt like I should have figured out, but most of which I didn't).  The ending was very satisfying.  I'm more basking in it rather than frustrated by it, which happens with some books.<br /><br />Only downsides were a couple.  The only major downside to the book is that I felt the &#34;bad guys&#34; were pretty shallow. You never get any sense of them as being people, like you do with &#34;good guys&#34;.  As for the minor quibbles, it definitely has the feel of a YA book at times, especially when dealing with the love interest, which as a 40-year-old I noticed how differently it felt than more adult books.  The other thing was the fake sci-fi-esq fake cursing.  I tend not to like it ever, and this book used it a lot.  At least half of the &#34;oh sparks&#34; should have been deleted.  But both of those complaints are minor quibbles, and probably more my personal preference than anything.<br /><br />I dropped a star for having the shallow antagonists, but I still feel like it deserves a 4.0 star rating for fun genre book.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It is a simple breakdown of how we should treat ourselves to become more fulfilled and happier with our circumstances. Ruiz gives great insight as to why we often can't find peace in our lives. Though it may not be for everyone, it is a great place to start. It is relatively unbiased, and, therefore, relatively unoffensive culturally, ethnically, or religiously speaking. This makes it much easier to incorporate the ideas presented into your own belief system.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought this PS3 controller and it is NOT the original one that came with the PS3. It is terrible. The buttons get stuck and lack the feel of the original controller. I play FIFA14 and it does not have the same feel and speed as the very original PS3 controller. You will notice a chalky or cakey feel to it. It is not the silky thing that the original PS3 controller is. I would like to find where I can buy the original PS3 wireless controller. It perhaps only comes with the PS3 system? Anyhow if you are a big FIFA player you may not want to buy this controller from Amazon. It seems that Sony (or their Contract Manufacturer) purposely produced this second rate controller so that you have to keep buying a new one That's planned obsolescence. I have gone through 3 of these recently and all have the same problem.Thankfully I still have the original PS3 controller, but it has some damage to it, regardless it works better than all of these new ones. I would look at a sports controller as I have recently purchased one and I will be testing it soon.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This really is a fun little hip-hop album that bounces between the serious/political and the fun/silly.  Look, I'm not going to say that this album will stand the test of time or that we will look back on Macklemore & Lewis as we do Run DMC, the Beastie Boys, NWA, Snoop or whomever but the songs are fun and catchy.  Also, while Macklemore is a more than competent lyricist and rapper, the beats by Ryan Lewis are really off-the-chart.  They are really spot on and can bring an almost club feel to certain tracks.  In fact, my favorite track on the album is an instrumental track call BomBom.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|Watched this in theaters, loved every minute of it. Non-stop action and a great movie in general. Would have purchased but given the tragedy of Paul Walker dying, and Universal now donating a percentage of the proceeds from the home media sales to Paul's wonderful charity. I'd feel absolutely awful not taking advantage of that. Paul touched my life through his acting and charitable acts and the fact I can support something he loved while getting something I love is just too much to pass up. Ordered two steelbook blu-ray+DVD+Digital HD copies one for myself and one for my father for Christmas.
B000084T18|4.0|Ah, the early 2000's.  It's well-rapped and well-produced hip-hop, some of which that works as dance music too.  The problem is, unless you are interested in hip-hop history or remember when the tracks came out the first time around, I'm not sure how well any of it stands up.

0123694965|5.0|This is a great, straight-forward book on iterative game design created by someone active in the field.  This is highly recommended if you are interested in the design theory, and not necessarily the coding, aspects of a game, digital or analog.  I will also say that this book does a great job of explicitly stating a lot of good and bad qualities about games that people seem to understand implicitly and are unable to vocalize.  I cannot say enough for this text; it is great for novices and experts alike.
B000T433CO|5.0|Love this holiday movie for the romantic/sappy movie lovers! Great chemistry among actors and a feel good movie you can watch over and over.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book clearly brought the reality of life in Europe during World War II to the reader's mind.  Great book!
B003YNFYD8|5.0|I love this album.  There are so many Beatles collections out there and they are all great (I love the &#34;1&#34; album) but for some reason, this one captures their later periods perfectly, in my opinion.  It includes all of the essentials from the indicated years without attempting to rob you of the whole-album experience... if I want to hear &#34;Abbey Road&#34;, I listen to it, but its hits are on here.  This album holds a solid place in my collection and gets more play than others like &#34;Past Masters&#34; and &#34;Anthology&#34;.  The new packaging is gorgeous, as expected.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I enjoy the Lethal Weapon series, so of course I am happy with this 4-movie set.  A good collection for a good price.
B00124DQZO|4.0|This album is excellent!  I managed to grab a &#34;CD album&#34; copy from Japan on a popular auction site and it was worth the few extra bucks.  The sound quality is very good and the set list is quite fulfilling for fans of early Chicago or enthusiasts who want a taste of early Chicago.  I personally think the set is quite ambitious, with the decision to front-load a string of then-new songs, but they open the show in a powerful way.  The older hits are done very well also, although I would personally trade the English version of &#34;Questions 67 and 68&#34; for the included Japanese version.  The &#34;Ballet&#34; suite is fantastic and the few longer jams toward the end of the set are fantastic.  The sound quality is not perfect but I do enjoy the mix much more than that of &#34;Live In '75&#34;, as well as the set choices; &#34;Live In '75&#34; has a more distant sound and is not as crisp, particularly in Kath's lead and Seraphine's snare.  That being said, the sound here is not perfect either; I feel Kath's and even Peter's lead vocal are sometimes lacking clarity, which I surprisingly DON'T feel in many moments on the &#34;Carnegie Hall&#34; vinyl set (pre-remaster).  The mix could be a little better which, combined with my so-so opinion of the Japanese versions of the two songs, made me bump off a star.  If you can get the CD album release, the packing is EXCELLENT, mimicking the gatefold vinyl format with the pictures, text, and scaled-down versions of the included poster and &#34;record&#34; sleeves, down to every last detail.  That's a very nice touch :)  In summary, a good-to-great recording of a strong set played by some talented, hard-working musicians in their formative years after some solid touring experience.  Choose this one over &#34;Live In '75&#34;... as for &#34;Carnegie Hall&#34;, it's a stalemate for me.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Love this board. No problems, no complaints, nothing. I used this board as a budget and ended up spending 1k. Not bad its 12/2013 and I don't have any problems.

1451666179|4.0|There are lots of repeat stories, but the new ones are great!  Like so many, I really relate to the depression stories and her accompanying running commentary about her shortcomings.  I think so many people feel that way - it just matters how much you dwell on those feelings.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|interesting, quirky, and surprising. Well made and worth the time. and the fish scene...ah everyone should clean a fish at the office.  better than talking on the phone all day.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Who cannot love the words of death writing about such a tragic era as World War II? The life of Leisel and all that she goes through makes you grateful for what you have and weep for what others had to endure... And endure she did. An amazing book!
B00GTZN0X4|3.0|The animation is excellent, as always.  The characters were interesting.  However, the story was familiar to anyone who has seen Cars.  Worth watching but I dont know if a second visit would give the viewer any surprises.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|I knew I enjoyed this movie years ago but I gotta say that it really is funnier now that I am older (eek, did I just say that?).  Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn did an excellent job.  I love them both.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent story. Kept me wondering almost till end. I am noob in legal matters but then also I could understand what's going on in court room.<br /><br />Thanks John Grisham for the wonderful story along with some good knowledge about legal system in US.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Seriously, I thought this was so horrible.  I am just giving my honest opinion.  Anyone that says that it was outstanding…well, I just can't value their opinion.  Hubby and I are arguing if &#34;The Piano&#34; or &#34;Les Miserables&#34; is the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />Dark and depressing.<br /><br />I had read the book a few years ago and I couldn't believe that it was a musical.  Yes, some memorable music, but not the storyline.<br /><br />Just my opinion.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Ever since I found the Pendergast series, I have definitely enjoyed it, and have read all but the first few books of the series (which I will probably go back and read at some point).  Anyway, this book is no exception.  Although I have really just started the book, I am enjoying it immensely.<br /><br />So far, the action centers around a small mountain town in Colorado, mostly catering to the extremely wealthy (similar to Vail or Aspen).  Since I've just started reading, I'll have to add more details later.

B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Dark, a bit confusing, descriptions of location are excessive.  I learned more about the scene than I did the people.  Maybe these characters are just played out.  Still, I enjoy reading about Kay Scarpetta and have read all of the novels about her.

B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|Fan since 1976 – generally do not do reviews same week of new releases – do we really love all music after 1 or 2 listens; especially since Brad has passed, and many did not like Corporate America, and Tom is 66 years old. I felt compelled to put in my thoughts.<br />Anyone expecting More than a Feeling, R&R Band, Smokin, Don’t Look Back, etc. or hold firm that no Brad equates to no Boston– are close minded. Those were 1970’s songs, and Brad has passed. Tom has evolved and “matured” as he says. For sure you have the right to not like and rip the album, but I look at it this way – Tom is 66, and this most likely will be the last Boston album. He plays all the instruments on the past 4 albums, and now uses multiple singers. Boston did 4 tours since Corporate America and between that and Brads death, vacations, etc. – it was very reasonable that this release took a decade. The MP3 downloads do not do the album justice. I recommend playing them loud, like in the car and give them many, many plays. I actually get goose bumps on many of the songs since the unique guitar sound that only Tom can do is there front and center. If you listen on an IPod or whatever, the production does sound muffled and so you need to blare it out loud! Sure, I would love a real drummer to be on there – but we are not going to get it, so accept it or hate it. Being an avid fan that keyed up the Boston website practically every day since it existed, honest; I appreciate any and all music by Tom Scholz. His unique sound brought me to Boston first. Listen, he DID NOT have to do any more music – but he chose to. He is who he is, and does what he wants and how he wants. I accepted that after Third Stage and Brad left for RTZ and was not on Walk On.<br />Songs: Heaven on Earth – awesome chorus, and at first did not like the low tones by David Victor singing, but after a dozen plays loud in my car, I get why it is done. The guitars are awesome and the song ends really nice. Topnotch song. Last Day of School – instrumental – nice guitar sounds with piano background – since no instrumentals on Corporate America, this is refreshing. I would love a total instrumental album from Tom. Wish it was longer, but I will take it. Sail Away – last Boston song we’ll probably ever hear Brad Delp on – I do not like the political talking in the song, but love the beat, the flow, and Brad’s voice – awesome. Life, Love & Hope – love this song – Tommy DeCarlo does just an awesome job, outstanding guitar – sounds like the 70’s - Great beat, great chorus. Someday – Tommy D singing again –great vocals, great beat, great guitar. The others are coming along as far as me getting used to them – all have their own place in the story Tom is trying to tell about this album. I would prefer Tom not singing, but again, understand WHY he is – this song affected him, and he wanted to sing it just because he felt no one else could portray the emotion of the song like he could. The 3 songs from Corporate America – ideally would not want to see them resurrected, I love the songs, but wanted all new songs. Again – Tom’s choice – I respect that, and do listen to them. By the way, I saw them 9 times on the past few tours, and the sound is awesome and the singers all do magnificent.<br />Bottom line – please have an open mind – Tom could have stopped doing this, and most likely this is the last new stuff we get. After a 2014 tour, he will be doing a long awaited DVD of live music – so who knows how long that will take. So any hope for an album from a guy that is approaching 70 is not likely. So – crank it up, think of that great guitar sound that is still there, and try and approach it in the light that it is not 1976. We all change, so did Tom, and so did Boston. Enjoy.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore & Lewis are talented hip-hop artists. The first song I heard of theirs was &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; which I found quaintly amusing, but it struck me as a &#34;one-hit-wonder&#34; kind of piece. I then heard their tiny desk concert outstanding performance of &#34;Ceiling Can't Hold Us&#34; featuring Ray Dalton's enchanting voice. I purchased this album shortly after that and could not be more pleased. Several songs feature previously unknown (to me) artists with a wide variety of different sounds, but all talented, and all that bring something to the performance. Macklemore & Lewis interweave their positive messages throughout, and the result is an interesting, uplifting, and thoroughly enjoyable album.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like this game but there is some problems when you play it on kindle fire the problem is that it freezes
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I couldn't wait to read this book because I loved the first two. I didn't really hats this book but I was kind of disappointed. I didn't like how POV changed from Tris to Tobias because Tris narrated the first to books so when it switched from characters I sometimes forgot I was reading from someone else's POV. I really didn't like how Tris died. If this was real life Tris dying would probly be more realistic than her living but I still did not like it when she died. I do like how she died for her Caleb though. Other than that I did like this book.

034580709X|3.0|I came to this book already a huge Nesbo fan.  Especially a Harry Hole fan - his difficult, alcoholic detective with unexpected soft spots in his heart.  The Bat is the first Hole story, and as such is early work of Nesbo's.  It shows.  Clearly the author's abilities grew through the years, and his relationship with Harry did, too, allowing him to give the man much more depth and character than he has in The Bat.  The story is twisty, as one expects from Nesbo, with drugs and violence aplenty.  Good and decent examples of humanity offer support to the whole arc.<br />I enjoyed it as a curiosity, a peek into the past, but if I had read this one first, it would have taken some convincing to get me to read another book by Nesbo.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Finally back to the writing that made me fall in love with the show to begin with!  I love the addition of the new &#34;batcave,&#34; it is about time the boys had a home to call their own!
B0083SF0FG|5.0|Awesome show!  This is one of my favorite scifi shows on television!  The first five seasons were excellent!  The storylines lagged in seasons 6 and 7 which culminated in the destruction of one of the worst big baddies in the series, the leviathan.  Season 8 redeems it all with the return of classic writers and storylines.  This is a great collection for Supernatural fans with fantatstic HD resolution and lots of extras.
B00GOZQ2E8|4.0|Good game. Usual farm type stuff but with the monster fighting twist. Easier for kids to understand than some other games of this type.
B00D7OMNXS|4.0|Not as good as the other two movies.  I was disappointed with the ending.  However, the blu ray definition was excellent and it is still a great addition to my blu ray library.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I love Yahoo Mail and have used it every day for at least 15 years.  So I thought an app for my Kindle Fire would be a great way to check my mail while I'm out.  Sure you can access your e-mail account through this app, and see if anyone's sent you an e-mail.  You can compose a new one, reply (although typing on the Kindle Fire isn't the best experience) but the app developers have forgotten the most important thing you need with an e-mail account.  The ability to log out so your bank statements, share trade confirmations, passwords for other websites, personal correspondence, payslips and everything you get e-mailed isn't there for any thief who steals your Kindle Fire to just press the Yahoo Mail app icon and have your inbox appear on the screen without having to enter your username or password.  Ridiculously that's exactly what they can do with this app.  Even if you have turned off your Kindle, when you turn it back on you can still get straight back in, and even if you don't even touch the app, your notifications in your Kindle show whoever has taken it your e-mails anyway.  Even pressing the Kindle's back arrow on the menu doesn't log you out like occurs with most apps.<br /><br />Kindle Fires are portable small devices, much more chance of being stolen from your bag, locker at your workplace, while your travelling or wherever you take it than someone breaking into your house and stealing your PC, yet users are even less protected.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|Public Domain Baby!  This title was free. I can read it anywhere. Vonnegut said that one can learn everything there is to know about life by reading The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky. Fyodor must have read this as inspiration (the timeline even looks right). Love, hate, the best and worst of mankind, are neatly condensed into this book.  The reader will cry with sadness, but more importantly, with joy.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|What can I say i loved this movie 10 years ago and i love this movie today. Its a great concept and has some great actors in it, even the late Paul Walker. Pleasantville is basically about what would happen if a modern day teenager was somehow put into Leave it to Beaver as though it was a real place with real people, plus still in black and white. Its great watching the black and white characters gradually turning into color. I think this movie will continue being watched by many generations.

B0016BP0PW|4.0|This is a really high rating for me, I rarely do 5 stars. This is not the type of movie I would usually care for, but it was so well done that I'll probably buy it. The characters were &#34;reflections&#34; of not only the characters in the songs, but of real individuals without mimicking them. It did an excellent job of reflecting the emotions, fears, passions, and confusion of the time period. For all that was going on in the 60's, there was a real clarity that became quickly lost in the 70's. I think we're beginning to see glimmers of it again and I hope it builds and can become sustainable this time. There are so many really good reviews here about the acting and how the songs were integrated that I won't go on except to say: watch this movie with an open heart, especially if you weren't alive yet, or old enough to aware of what was happening.
B00CJCHJ8S|3.0|Wow talk about wasted opportunity.  Harry was rolling through 1973 then allowed his excesses and stubborness to destoy him and his music.  Although drop-offs in quality material are the norm in music (e.g., Joe Jackson, Joe Cocker, The Who, Jethro Tull to name a few who had HUGE drop offs in quality material), no one had a drop off like Harry Nilsson.  I love his material through A Little Touch of Schmilsson (it is mostly terrific), but his 5 albums after that all are TOTALY AWFUL!!  They are all unlistenable, almost like another person did them.  Seriously, there is not ONE good song to be found - NOT ONE!  This may still be a pretty good value for everything up to Pussy Cats, though you can ignore the rest.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This movie is - *I* thought!! - so very profound and incredibly moving!!  Once again, Denzel nails it!  I've watched it more than once!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved Tina Fey on SNL, so I was predisposed to love this book. Really funny stories about life, work, and family. Lots of celebrity name dropping and stories that manage to always be interesting. And did I mention funny?
B002PZ6XB8|5.0|I wouldn't recommend this film for everyone, but I found it enchanting and tragic.  The acting was lovely and the scenery is awe inspiring.  Have tissues on hand.  I loved the time period and the costuming.  Soundtrack was very pleasant.  The transition from daughter to independent woman was just a sign of the times.
B002JE43O4|2.0|This item was ordered as a gift, since after all it is a gift set. However once it came, I unboxed it to find that yes, everything was there(dvds, book,and the dog tags) the ppackaging looks like its been beaten to hell and back. I still love the item, its great for only 20 dollars, but I cant display it(aswell) with the collection box being so damaged. If the aesthetic dont bother you then its still a great buy though.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Illustrated answers to my questions.<br /><br />I love that when I want to know something, I can find the answer in such an entertaining way.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|This is a plausible story especially in light of the social and political climate of the time.  Well acted by all star cast
B00A7ZWUJC|4.0|This music lived up to my expectations.  I found it to be a good buy for my purposes.  Will buy more cds in the future
B000T433CO|5.0|This film is warm, funny and has an endearing story and it has become a Holiday favorite in our home.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I am a big Adam Lambert fan.  This cd did not let me down.  I will buy more cds from him in the future

B00AEFYDV8|4.0|The Francis Coppola adaptation of John Grisham's THE RAINMAKER (1997) stars Matt Damon. Also with Danny DeVito as his ambulance-chasing law partner), Claire Danes, Jon Voight, Mary Kay Place, Johnny Whitworth, Dean Stockwell, Teresa Wright (her final movie), Virginia Madsen, Mickey Rourke, Andrew Shue, Red West, Randy Travis, Roy Scheider and Danny Glover.<br /><br />It's the story of an idealistic young attorney who starts out with a corrupt firm but soon goes out on his own. Rudy Baylor (Damon) breaks a cardinal rule of lawyering, not to get personally involved with clients, but the people he cares about have no one else to help them.<br /><br />One is the elderly woman who takes Rudy on as a tenant and part-time yardman. Miss Birdie's (Wright) second husband left her a fortune, and her golddigging, no-good kids from a previous marriage want to make sure they'll inherit the estate. Another is a real sad case, Kelly Riker (Danes), a young woman who's regularly battered by husband Cliff (Shue). This current baseball bat thrashing has put Kelly in the hospital, yet she won't divorce Cliff as he's threatened to kill her if she tries.<br /><br />Finally, there's Donny Ray Black (Whitworth). He desperately needs an operation but the insurance company refuses to pay for it. Donny's parents (Place and West) don't have the resources to fight this corporation, but Rudy's willing to help in any way he can. Rudy has just passed the bar exam but is unlicensed when he goes into court on Donny's behalf. An enraged Judge Hale (Stockwell) orders Rudy out of his courtroom until he has his credentials, but the insurance company's high-priced attorney, Leo Drummond (Voight) appeals to allow Rudy to stay on and Hale obliges by swearing the young man in. Of course Drummond has an ulterior motive: to teach a rookie lawyer not to take on the best.<br /><br />Judge Kippler (Glover) takes over when Hale has a fatal coronary, and unlike Hale, this magistrate is not friendly to Drummond.<br />(NOTE: Glover has a significant role yet he receives no screen credit.)<br /><br />THE RAINMAKER is an excellent film, Grisham's favorite screen adapation, and is highly recommended./>(NOTE: Glover has a significant role yet he receives no screen credit.)<br /><br />THE RAINMAKER is an excellent film, Grisham's favorite screen adapation, and is highly recommended.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|The reviews for the Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit movies are very confusing. This review is for the Extended Edition 3-disc Blu-ray of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. (The DVD version is 5 discs. If in doubt, check the minutes shown in the details of the page.)<br /><br />I did a review of the extended edition Fellowship of the Rings. It was fantastic and well worth the money as were the extended editions of the other two movies.<br /><br />The extended edition for The Hobbit is not as fantastic. There are a couple scenes that really make you think, &#34;Ohhhh! Now I get it!&#34; but that's about it. In spite of the minimal changes, it is still worth the money in my opinion. The additional material is also good - not as good as the Lord of the Rings extended editions but still.<br /><br />I have never read the books and he read them but a long time ago so we can not speak to any differences between the books and the movie.<br /><br />If you are choosing between buying the extended edition and the original, definitely buy the extended edition.<br /><br />If you are not a big fan and you already own the original version, you might not want to bother.<br /><br />If you are a fan, even if you own the original version, you will probably appreciate the extended edition - it's a borderline call.<br /><br />The packaging is a little different than the extended editions of the Lord of the Rings but it was designed to be part of that set and that shows. I don't care about that really but I understand collectors do.<br /><br />Until now, we have not purchased Blu-rays but we happened to need another dvd player and the prices for the Blu-rays have dropped so much we decided to go ahead with the Blu-ray player. We had seen the Blu-ray movies in stores displayed next to the DVD version of the movies and the difference was amazing. Still, with neither of us being fanatical about picture quality and sound beyond the &#34;quite good&#34; point, it is still more expensive to buy the Blu-ray discs (although they are dropping in price). We came to the conclusion that it would be worth it to buy Blu-rays of movies that were particularly graphic intensive such as the Hobbit but for run of the mill movies we would stick with the cheaper dvds.<br /><br />We were disappointed with the Hobbit on Blu-ray. We had watched the Hobbit before on pay-per-view and we could not see any real difference between the HD and the Blu-ray. In this case, the Blu-ray was actually a dollar or so cheaper so no big deal but don't expect to be stunned by the Blu-ray.<br /><br />This came with a code for a free Ultraviolet copy. If you don't know what this is please do your research. Since we did not go out and buy brand new latest and greatest equipment just to watch this movie, the free Ultraviolet copy was useless. It would not play on anything except our new Blu-ray player and why would we need it for that? We have the Blu-ray disc. Personally, I see the Ultraviolet copy as utterly useless and NOT a selling point for anything at all.
B0083GPDBO|3.0|The movie was good just not one of those big Blockbuster movies. If your just interested in watching a movie to past the time this one is ok .
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Definite chick-flick. Technically a romantic comedy. Hilarious. Not a tear-jerker like most chick-flicks. Renee Zellweger is great.<br /><br />Typical story - will she choose the good guy or the bad boy? Throughout the movie she writes in her journal. The journal entries and the rest of the scenes from the movie are hysterically funny. You get to see the not so sexy side of women. The most famous scene is probably the panty scene - which pair to wear for a date? I will let you guess how that goes.<br /><br />If you like romantic comedies, this is one of the best.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Funny movie. Watch it over and over. Wish I would have done the same when I worked in an office. Guess what character.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Nice price for the 50th considering what they were charging in theaters. I don't see what all the fuss is about.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had no idea how much I would like this App. I thought I'd give it a try because I knew absolutely nothing about Pinterest. Well, boy do I love it. I have created several boards and have spent hours having a great time checking out what's on the site. Some of the Boards, i.e., Dr. Oz is one I'm following. I was also excited when I discovered people like some of my pins and added them to their boards.<br /><br />I don't think I will ever get tired of using Pinterest. I think everyone should at least check it out.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I had the free version on my phone for nearly a year, keeping me occupied in waiting rooms, airports, etc. I finally decided that I enjoyed it enough to make it official... and now have the deluxe version on my tablet.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I am really enjoying watching the music videos. There are some songs that just have audio which are labeled as such. This app is really good and I enjoy sharing my favorites on Pinterest and Facebook.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This movie was more fun and more entertaining than I had hoped it would be.  It was funny, clever, as well as visually entertaining.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A wonderful program about life in the early to mid 1900's.  The characters are complex and the plot has lots of twists & turns!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Works great, not bulky!A good cover for the Kindle Fire! Protects it very nicely while giving a good surface to grip.
B005PK553C|5.0|Its my favorite show and genre. The actors and writing are both exquisite<br />And intriguing.<br /><br />Amazing TV program of the dead telling their stories...
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|So far the game has been very interesting.  There seems to be a much better storyline than other games in this genre.  However, once you've reached a certain point, it costs $5 to unlock before you can go further. I'd wish that it's told you that right from the beginning.  It's good to let us try before buying, but feels more like baiting/hooking me in to a good spot where I can't resist spending the $5.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Wonderful adaptation of the boardgame. The player interface is very easy to navigate, my only criticism of the game is it's lack of instructions outside of the tutorial.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A brave girl reliving her horrendous experience. We can never fully appreciate what happened to her<br />I hope in writing this book some healing took place<br />She deserves a huge amount of happiness to counter balance what was stolen from her by the evil she encountered so early in life. I hope her children bring her joy so great that it helps cancel out thoughts of how they were conceived<br />May she love them for who they are and nurture them to be all they can be
0786962984|4.0|Fun, simple treasure-collecting board game appropriate for ages 8 and up, but the player pieces and stands are very cheaply made. I would recommend finding other pieces for the players. Some of the movement tiles are also hard to distinguish between (unlike earlier versions of the game). I purchased for the nostalgia (had the game as a kid) and it hit the spot.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Will recommend this series to all my family, friends and colleagues who wants to read a romantic novel over cup of coffee.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Terrific movies. Really enjoyed them. I also bought the entire Tremor series and just wish there were more. Disappointed it did not continue.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love this type of game, not too hard, just fun with great graphics. Lots of fun puzzles to solve
B0082Z447U|5.0|Love this story. Wilkie Collins' work is so brilliant and  he brings the particular era to life. Very imaginative.  The movie is also good but of course the book is more in depth and very worthwhile reading.
B00422LESO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I absolutely loved every page!<br />I can't wait to read another novel by Shannon Hale.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|Best comedy series of all time, you can not miss collection for those who like the series.<br />Box very cool
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works very well.  Very glad to have this on my kindle fire HD. It cleans everything you need it to an then some.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Arrived on time and in good condition.  My daughter has been asking for a barbie house for a while and this fit the bill!
B0061S0A64|4.0|Drop the beat, no really. It's a fun relaxing app that starts off with a good beat going and adding to their base design beats is pretty fun and the making is even better. If there was more flexibility or customizing of the beats and how they would interact instead of just the string method like if they also interacted whenever they met the primary nodes and not just at the small one's something interesting could happen there.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Love this game!!!!! Play it all day long. My 12year old son loves to help. Easy game play and quests are not hard, not easy but just right.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Now this is a E-reading program if any I saw one. When I got it the program it was on sale so yeah me, but seriously it's a work of art when it works. The read to you system needs some work, but otherwise it's 'Beau-ti-ful' as I would say. And yes I know I spelled beautiful in such an odd way, blar. Anyways the reader works wonders, once you get the bad boy going you just need to be wary of it stopping on you with the page swipes. It happens yes, just stop the app then restart it and you're back to where you were. Hell it's better than Adobe Reader at times
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Fabulous, exciting.....a great series, I can't wait for the next one!!!! It is hard waiting until the new ones comes out....can't they write any faster?  lol
B0050KEVO6|5.0|great app. Really enjoyed it. much fun. great play. you drag and combine and all sorts of fun stuff. yeah
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|I love this song!!  It has a great beat to it and a really fun song to dance to with my 5-year old
B006TVQU6C|3.0|It really is a nice looking case but for an Antec product I'm ashamed with it. The metal they have used is not of the high quality like any other Antec case i know. The cable management is not the best if you don't have a full or semi modular PSU. Doesn't come with a front intake fan but that didn't bother me as i ordered some Corsair ones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Its a Cheap &#34;Antec&#34; Case.<br />It looks nice and will fit in nicely on a desk without looking out of place.<br />Front 3.0 USB ports.<br />It comes with a PSU Air Filter.<br />Its lighter then Air.<br />Comes with 2 decent exhaust fans.<br />Matt Black on the inside unlike the Antec 300's<br />Nice Big CPU cut out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Its a Cheap &#34;Antec&#34; Case. (Cheap metal)<br />Its lighter then Air. (Cheap metal)<br />Doesn't come with intake fan or filter.<br />Not the Best cable management.<br />It can't compete with the Antec 300 Price/Performance ratio.<br />--------------------------------------<br />its a nice looking basic case and i will be keeping mine as it will fit in nice next to my Antec 1200.
0061537969|5.0|A stranger in the airport recommended this book to me, and I am glad that she did! I loved this book. I will never looked at dogs the same after reading it. It is a fun read that I still chuckle about even months after reading it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|First off let me say that I was not a big fan of hunting l. I was browsing through the app store and came across this app and thought what the heck I'll download it.<br /><br />I'm starting to play it and boy oh boy this game is awesome. Graphics are as good as they get when your playing on a kindle. I love hunting these animals and the challenges it gives you. Love hunting special animals, best part.<br /><br />The gun selection is good not too many but good. I love how you can upgrade and the game makes you upgrade them. Price range is about right.<br /><br />The only thing I would love to see is a trophy room with the heads of the killed special animals that would be awesome.<br /><br />I'm still at the beginning so I haven't experienced the whole game but if you are looking to play a fun and addictive game this is the way to go!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|simple and it simply works! why worry about some fancy app. When all you need is a simple app that upon your command, lights up the darkness.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome game...finally a game that gives you something to think about!!<br />Game gets harder and makes you slow down and articulate your moves.
B0093Q9SCS|5.0|I Love it.  It helps me get over my grief of losing my husband.  I've seen it a thousand times!!
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|The crew went somewhere most American's have never been before..inside the food industry. This really opened my eyes even more. I want to know the truth and do something about how and what my family consumes. The government controls too much already. From what we are allowed to see on television, how we raise our children, and even what we put on our table. Before you sit down to eat..ask yourself, &#34;Where exactly did this food come from, how was it prepared and what has been put into it!?&#34; We are being mislead and lied to everyday. This is OUR country..and I want it back. How about you!?
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This book tied up loose ends from a previous book. I enjoyed Dust more than the last couple of books that Cornwell has written.
B000WBOV1G|5.0|Great acting. An very good story lines.  James Woods is a terrific actor!  Some of the other actors are great, too!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|this is a cool cleaning app it takes care of everything you dont have to stress when your kindle starts to go slow just sweep it you will see a faster smoother kindle
B0017SWPXY|3.0|It's a fast read and basically well-written.  The style is quite different because the view of human life is seen through the eyes of a dog - he relates what we humans do based on his perspectives from a dog's experience and understanding of life ... certainly an interesting way of looking at what we humans do.  The story is told in flashback, but for me, sometimes the time jumps are a little bit abrupt.  Another difficulty for me is all the analogies to car racing. I know nothing about racing and put the sport at the very bottom of my list, so I had a hard time connecting.  Readers who enjoy car racing at any level, meaning one does not have to be a fanatic, would find a connection and discover the analogies make a lot of sense.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think Hill Climb Racing is a very great and fun game. I love to save up my money and buy new stages and cars.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Elaborate, dense plot.  Two very Existential protagonists Theo and Boris make up their rules for how to live.  Also a very good lesson in art appreciation.
B00GINENG0|4.0|I love this game. It's cute, fun, and realistic. Why did I take a star away? Well, I wanted to turn the notifications off, so then I tapped the icon to turn it off. Then, it turned off then on. I had negative coins after that. Be careful when you're turning notifications off. I recommend getting this app.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|Lots of fun.  If you like Angry Birds, you'll like Hambo. The premise is pretty simple, shoot the bad guys, and the game is very forgiving.  If you can't clear a level on your own, you can either skip it entirely or ask the game to show you the solution.  There are many levels and it's very entertaining
0062107313|5.0|Amy Tan is one of my wife's favorite writer's.  I hope she can be a little quicker next time, please.
B00005ATQF|4.0|One of the better VN films.  The first part is a grueling depiction of  Marine boot camp which is still vivid in my memory from first watching this over a decade ago.  Also one of Matthew Moline's better efforts.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I read this book years ago, but have lost it.  The section on why US students are behind Asian was great
B000WCDBKM|4.0|One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies.  This is a spooky mystery movie that delivers both suspense, mystery and a modicum of titillation.  If you liked movies such as Rose Mary's Baby, this one should be right up your alley.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|The film Jurassic Park is an excellent movie that portrays the apprehension that the public feels towards biotechnology and cloning. Many members of the public fear this new technology because of the unethical behavior of scientists and capitalists. This film enhances these fears as scientists and capitalists are depicted as unethical monsters who use the technology they have created to revive extinct species of dinosaurs for profit. Unlike the experts who are enlisted to review the park, the scientists who created the dinosaurs are depicted as machines doing the bidding of the greedy capitalist John Hammond. Instead of following scientific processes and ensuring that ethical behavior is observed, the scientists merely follow the orders of the capitalists. In this sense, Jurassic Park is not only a commentary on the unethical actions of those involved in both science and capitalism, but a commentary on how the current system for scientific research is so reliant on outside funding that it is impossible to ensure that scientific research is done without the threat of unethical behavior.<br /><br />The unethical behavior depicted in the movie has a major impact on public perception of the biotechnology and cloning. Rather than supporting the positive aspects of cloning and recognizing how cloning and other biotechnology can improve their lives, members of the public are more inclined to fear this technology. This is a direct result of the exaggerated scientific processes that are depicted in Jurassic Park. While it has been stated by several scientists that it is extremely unlikely that scientists will ever be able to actually clone a dinosaur, members of the public still believe that it is possible to revive these ancient creatures and others like them. While the public would benefit from the cloning of human organs and other body parts, it is hesitant to accept cloning because it fears that scientists will act unethically when using the technology. Overall, JurassicPark exaggerates the threat that unethical scientists pose when using cloning for medical purposes.
B0065CCM76|4.0|Would have gotten 5, but it did not have &#34;If I were a carpenter&#34; or &#34;Feel Like a number.&#34;Still, it's a great value on sale.
B00B0LPYXG|1.0|We watched this movie coz it's starred by Denzel Washington who is a very good actor. We enjoyed his other movies. However there were several dragging scenes which were unnecessary making this movie long. At the beginning of the movie, there was frontal nudity which was uncalled for (dont know if that's supposed to be an art!) & made the movie cheap. Profane language was also used throughout the movie. There was a time wherein the momentum was building up then was flattened again by a dragging scene. We just wanted to finish the movie coz we already spent time watching it! It's a good thing we didn't watch this in the theater & save ourselves money! I'm quite disappointed that Denzel will make such a bad movie like this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Read this in two sittings. Kept my interest and I couldnt put it down.  Grisham is a favorite and he never disappoints!
B00EOARZ4G|5.0|Good book, good action and fitting swan song for Tom Clancy.  Jack Jr gets to revisit an old case of Jack Senior and save the world  from the bad ole Ruskies the process.<br /><br />If only real life worked out this well.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I could relate to the scenarios about being an introvert in today's extroverted world. The book brought out the positive characteristics of introverted thinking.
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|Complex, historical, and great storytelling...what more do you need?  This may be his best, but the others are very good too.
B00EARP0HM|3.0|Surprising ending. I wonder how they'll tie this together with the movies?<br /><br />You'd think after all this time they'd fix a couple of typos, though. LO.
B003K15IF8|5.0|This is one of the most powerful novels I've ever read.  This is touching and real; I found Stoner to be a rich character with strengths and weaknesses which were heroic and all to human at the same time.  For anyone who's life has been touched by a special teacher, instructor or somewhat eccentric professor; this may be a great read for you.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|you will not be disappointed!  I became part of this book. when that happens you know its great! read it before you see the movie!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I never tire of watching this version of PERSUASION.  Amanda Root and  Ciar&aacute;n Hinds are perfect as the reticent, star-crossed lovers, ditto the film score, cinematography, all of it.  I've probably viewed it 10 times, but I'd view it again in a heartbeat.  As soon as the restored version came out, I bought it.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|This is the story of a young boy who is in the Museum of Art during an explosion. He leaves with the painting The Goldfinch .His mother is killed in the explosion.  The reader follows his story and the relationships that he develops. This book is extremely well written and engages the reader. My one negative comment is that it is very wordy and thus unnecessarily long. Not withstanding I do recommend it
B006OCM0G0|2.0|It was ok but down loaded it on my kindle and didn't have the manuverbilty that I do on my computer. So it wasn't as much fun but is a good game on my pc
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I saw the 1945 movie when I was in grade school. I saw the movie listing on Amazon Prime, and decided to watch it again.<br /><br />The ending was not quite as I remembered, so I bought the book for my Kindle. It has been years since I last read a Christie mystery. It was worth the re-read. Christie is a master of the mystery and this is one of her best.<br /><br />If you haven't read one recently this is one to pick up.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I don't use Facebook for a social  site...I like some of the sites and information........but my greatest reason is for the laughs  I  get from the animal site I am on...... informative, and super great pictures of all kinds of animals.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILERS.  SPOILERS.<br /><br />The book kept my attention, barely.  I did not particularly enjoy this book and I thought the two points of view were horrific. The book would have flowed much better with Tris stories, and Tobias stories towards the end.<br /><br />Even though I felt the writing was rushed and jumbled, I have to give credit to the author for having the guts to do what so many YA authors will not.  Hunger Games and Harry Potter both ought to have had similar ends but I feel the authors chickened out.
B00GOZQ2E8|5.0|I find this game to be very fun, and mildly addictive. It's very simple and good to play to just pass the time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I felt that the final book in this series did a great job of explaining and tying together all three books.  I know that a lot of people have been disappointed by the ending of the third book however I feltthat it appropriately gave more depth too many of the characters. This is one series of that I would recommend to others.
B00GIZO674|5.0|It's great and fun. A great way to kill time or just play on and on until you can't keep your eyes open anymore
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I've played it on IOS so I looked until I found this only one problem it takes a lot of space BUT ITS WORTH IT
B004X6PRO6|4.0|A surreal world...and yet hope springs eternal for some. Read the author's notes at the end to sort fact from fiction. Sadly, for ordinary the people of North Korea, the facts are depressing. The fiction of the story is the life of one man and how he influences the lives (for the better) of others. The human spirit shines through. Perhaps someday that spirit will rise up and the people of North Korea will regain their sense of individual destiny.
B00F2362IE|3.0|My son loves it, but the game freezes ALOT. He has shut down his tablet every time this happens to get the game to reset.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Fast read. Keeps you  involved to the end!  One of his best novels. I highly recommend it.  You will enjoy it
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this book it really sweet and house and cupcakes and ducks and flowers and bananas and lattes and limes
B006P4FBUE|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It plays nice sound once balanced between my kindle fire hd's volume and that of the selected instrument within the app.(this is very apparent how to do once using it)<br />Many capabilities of this app are included. The only gripe I have is that I have not figured out how to hold a note for extended time.<br /><br />All in all a good app to play with. Most of the negative ratings I read are not true in my case. If you have bad sound, it may be your device speakers, try good headphones maybe. Loaded quickly and easily, and the fitting issue is non. Sure you have a doubled screen for cord play, but this is able to be overcome by talent. Besides, its a whole piano on a small screen, Yeah it'll be a bit tight.<br />I will recommend it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock app!  My favorite feature is to be able to select playlists to wake me up.  I live in an area that gets sketchy radio reception, so being able to wake to a large assortment of music is very cool.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|What u see is what u get... It is going to be a Christmas present for my Husband and Im sure he will love it cause its a great movie. I am overall pretty please with my purchase.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I loved it !  I love her books anyway and this one was a definite hit - fun and confusing at the same time!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful, well written and well developed characters make a fast paced, entertaining drama.  Each scene is a delight for the eye.  Costuming is perfection, from the jewelry of the Crawley family to the worn pocketbook of the Cook, Mrs. Patmore.  Can't wait for Season Four!
B00GX598FO|4.0|Funny, and well written.  Great cast with excellent comedic timing.<br />There is no need to watch Red 1, but I would since it is the beginning of the character development and adds to the enjoyment of this second installment.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It helped when I wanted to get an accurate tell of the battery charge.I really recommend this app for anyone since it is easy to use.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great show, awesome video quality, downloads and buffers very quickly.  Will definitely look to amazon for digital shows and movies.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Cool game to play. It's fun and it helps kill time. Theirs nothing wrong with this game and my lil bro plays it all the time also he is into the game.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Have been following this show since season 2 & wanted to see how this great show started. Not at all disappointed and the tie in between Season 1 & current is sometimes an &#34;aha&#34; moment!
1593275080|5.0|Beautiful LEGO is an uncommon book. Unlike other LEGO books by No Starch Press, it neither contains building instructions nor any tips&tricks. It's more like an exhibition catalogue or an art book, which one would rather expect from a publisher like Taschen.<br /><br />On 260 pages, the author presents a mindblowing amount of high-quality pictures of some of the most impressive creations made by LEGO fans.<br /><br />What I personally love about that book is that it excludes super large-scale objects like the Legoland sculptures (which in fact are not so hard to make if you just have enough bricks). Instead, it shows tiny models from a dozen up to a few thousand bricks - models that impress by their ingenuity and uniqueness and not by their sheer size. Therefore, the book is a great inspiration even for Lego hobbyists with a limited budget.<br /><br />Well done, Mike Doyle!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is awsome now if you give this only one star then you are looking at the wrong game! :B
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Fascinating read of a period that I knew little or nothing about.<br />I enjoyed the murder and mayhem and all the achievements of 1927.<br />Well researched and masterfully told.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy playing this game; however, now that I'm at level 13 no matter what my score is, I can't get ahead.  Other than buying more moves, I can't advance.  I've had over 43,000 points and still can't go to next level.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Solo happy that Candy Crush Saga has come to kindle.  I feel like I've been waiting for forever to be able to play on my kindle.  Color me one happy camper!
B002DQLGHU|3.0|Kids really liked this. If you have really little ones, there are a few 'scary' scenes. So parents may want to watch it first.
B009EEGWOQ|4.0|Solid ELP album.  The 1st side is one long title track broken into several sections.  Great if indulgent stuff.  Wish prog rock would get it's due.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Good Grief! This album is horribly produced! The mix is the poorest I've ever heard on any album. Seriously can you not hear that?<br />I was listening to it on Rhapsody and it's the only album mix that sounds flat and doesn't stand out. Isn't Tom Scholz  supposed to be the production master? Not sure what happened but I can't even hear the vocals buried under the bad drum kits. No screaming guitars? What's up? Only 30 minutes of music after another long wait between albums? The album art is cool as it always is with that guitar drifting further away from the planet though. Sorta symbolic don't ya think?
B00000IMTF|4.0|Perhaps the best Rainbow album with Dio on vocals.  Stargazer is the best song, a near side long epic.  Other tracks go from great to OK.  Blackmore was with Dio's medievalism but would soon tire of it and move to a lamer pop metal version of Rainbow.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Very cute movie for anyone of all ages.  The UltraViolet Digital Copy is very nice also so I can watch it online when I'm not home.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|extremely satisfied with this!! first review i ever written by me , urge so much that i have to, looking forward to vetage and trunk to come out.!!! have a good day!
B003FMTZOM|5.0|This album is very well produced. It was not successful because it is not made up of the usual ballads. This time Christina goea beyond the everyday American pop. This album has hip hop and lots of electrical beats and sound. This will be similar to Adam Lambert and Pussycat Doll radio sound. Furthermore,  I also purchased the latest by Gaga and this is a thousand times better in sound and words,  in my opinion.
B00F880BWG|4.0|mid-season finale was by far one of the best episodes of the entire series! The writing is fantastic, the special effects sublimely disgusting.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Very dull book. No surprises in the plot but a lot of repetition of the same information over and over again. Characters are shallowly portrayed and developments are telegraphed well in advance. Not worth reading. Probably of interest to people who follow all the Ford County stories.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of those rare books that I absolutely loved and totally hated. I loved the real and relate-able characters, the banter, and the friendship and love that Hazel Grace and Gus shared despite of what they had been dealt in life--their look on life and suffering was an encouragement to me, a motivation to make every day my best day. I totally hated this book because of the realness of their story, their pain and suffering, and the loss that was all throughout this book. The Fault in Our Stars made me cry, made me feel, made me think, and made me want to go back and reread it right away.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Very engrossing novel and this is from a reader who did not like &#34;The Shining&#34;. I don't know that this story needs to be connected to &#34;The Shining&#34; but it worked far better than I expected. I'm finding King's work in the past few years to be more readable than his early books.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham always keeps my interest.  Characters are well defined and the content rolls along smoothly.  I had a hard time putting this one down.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Steven King never ceases to amaze me with his ability to draw you into his macabre world, making the unimaginable become believable. What an imagination and uncanny story telling ability.  Readers of spellbinding fiction will not be able to put this book down.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This was a well written story. Things will still surprise you at the conclusion of the book.  A very good choice for book club!
B00785P2QC|5.0|really nice game. I love it has a lot of very good graphics and fun areas. wish money wasn't as tight though
034580404X|5.0|I owned these books on my kindle reader, however I wanted to buy the collection as a gift, I must say the delivery was fast and they on the way to make someone a happy reader.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I only wish my mother ever had the chance to read this.....Thank you mom for opening my eyes to books years ago and most if all, Stephen King.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love this series because it is very entertaining.  I can watch it over and over and never tire of it.
B00BEIYMTW|4.0|My daughter loves all things animated and has quite an extensive movie collection. She loved this cute lil &#34;Cars&#34; concept movie in the theatres and I am sure will enjoy it even more at home.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a nice little device, streams seamlessly from netflix, however I am facing problems for youtube casting. video gets frozen every 2-4 mins, if I cast from my android device or youtube.com. However it runs smoothly if I use the browser plugin. I wish it could  stream video from my pc.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|This was a cute movie and had lots of action and beautiful colored scenery to keep a young child's attention in the theatre. I've read some critiques that nailed it for the &#34;caveman&#34; theme. Why not? We have movies that cover just about everything else... I just see it as another cute kid movie.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|My favorite game , keeps my mind busy and entertains me also. I spend hours with this game, and always hate to stop.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|This makes case #3 i've tried for this phone. All of them are OK. otterbox was probably the best, but just so massive in size. Overall, it's a thinner profile and OK, but definitely not going to protect your phone from a big drop.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a great, easy read. I loved the whole trilogy and all of the surprises, twists, and turns along the way. :)
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Captures the quiet pace and emotion of the book (except for Elizabeth who comes across as pouty instead of arrogantly proud).
B00GX59QO2|3.0|Not as good as RED To formula, impression it was pasted together.  Liked the  Japanese  guy tho, amazing fight scenes.
B0000CAXID|3.0|This is one of my all-time favorite records, but I was disappointed when I received this because it was scratched and one or two of the tracks simply won't play. Disc was too cheap to be worth it for me to send back. If I ever get around to it, I'll take it to a local game store and get it cleaned and maybe it will work again.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Thos movie is a really amazing movie! The graphis were amazing! The sotry is unique because its a movie of owls which has not been done before! Very exciting fight scenes as well and the slow motion parts are great!
0316069515|2.0|Generally, once I pick up a Mickey Haller novel, I can't put it down.  What can I say, I'm a sucker for a good legal thriller/ legal drama.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't say that The Gods of Guilt lived up to my expectations. To be honest, this was the first book of Connelly's that I actually put down midway, so that I could get back to something \\"more interesting.\\"  It wasn't necessarily a disappointment, but, well, perhaps I should just lay it all out. (I will avoid spoilers)<br /><br />The Good: The story is tightly written, as per usual. Connelly's style is well developed and fast paced. The plot itself is complex and really requires our protagonist to stop wallowing in self-pity and follow his gut instinct. And of course, there is the classic Mickey Haller maneuvering. Oh how I love the combination of danger and comic relief<br /><br />The Meh: The voice, for me at least, was lost. In previous books Mickey Haller's voice is riveting, you can hear it leap off the pages.  In Gods of Guilt--not so much. Instead, it seems that Connelly is writing to cater to his audience, rather than writing for the character. While this can be an effective marketing tool, it didn't hook me.  Luckily there were occasional moments when \\"Haller's voice\\" reappeared, and \\"Connelly's voice\\" faded into the background.<br /><br />The Bad: What I'm about to say doesn't apply to everyone.  This really depends on the reader, and what the reader is looking for in Connelly's latest Haller book.  The long and short of it is, this book is a story of redemption. It really exposes another side to Haller, adds depth to his character, sends him swinging from an underdog position, and digs into his past. Unfortunately, this development did not appeal to me and likely will not appeal to all readers.  I suppose it's because I'm more invested in Haller's legal battle to save his clients than I am in Haller's need to reconcile himself with what he does/ the sort of man that he is.  Don't get me wrong, the personal struggles of Haller are interesting and well developed. But they also take over the book, which frankly, was not something I enjoyed.<br /><br />In sum, the Gods of Guilt is a decent read and depending on what you are looking for, it may be best to stick to paperback ., the personal struggles of Haller are interesting and well developed. But they also take over the book, which frankly, was not something I enjoyed.<br /><br />In sum, the Gods of Guilt is a decent read and depending on what you are looking for, it may be best to stick to paperback .
B0051UT7Q2|5.0|A brilliant author wrote a brilliant book combining history and a heart-gripping story. It induced me to read Montefiore's next book, which was also a winner.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Space Cowboys. There is not much to say about Firefly other than that, and that alone should tell you it's worth watching. This was a series that was ended far too soon. Serenity made up for it a little bit, but still...wish we'd had a few more seasons.

B00BHHIWQO|4.0|good game but it seems to kick me out and I lose a star.  other than that it is fun.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I would love to read and review this book but I can't get over the insulting fact that Amazon charges US customers $1.78 to download the Kindle edition and $18.21 if you happen to have an Australian IP address. This is not an isolated example.<br />In response to this situation I generally end up buying paperback editions from online retailers such as BookDeposit rather than get gouged by Amazon.
B004LUS390|2.0|I really llike this app, but since tthe 4.4 Kitkat update, I can't export pictures. The app crashes every time I try, no matter what I try to export. I imagine you've already updated it on google play, so please do so here. I would really love to enjoy tis App again and will give you 5 starts when it's repaired.
031623480X|5.0|This book is so informative. After reading, I'm passing copies along to all of my immediate family in hopes to encourage their continued physical health and wise wits.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Classic Baldacci! I read a poor rating on this title which said that they questioned the authenticity of the author. I don't get that at all. It is very similar in character development as the previous King and Maxwell books. If you liked these characters in the past reads you will like this one as well. If you have not experienced these characters I recommend this as well as the previous. I would go back and read the other possibly first if you have the time but it is not necessary.
B003G4W49C|3.0|So, basically everyone is going to tell you that this is the most influential sci-fi books ever written (yada, yada, yada), so there is no point in me repeating these words of praise.  If you need someone to convince you that this book is brilliant then I suggest reading the other +5,000 4-5 star reviews that say so.  I (on the other hand) am going to talk about the plot and ponder why it seems to strangely resonate with the U.S. military.<br /><br />Warning, Spoilers (and you really don't want me the spoil the end for you if you don't know it already)<br /><br />To break down the story, Ender Wiggins lives in a world that is under a state of Martial law.  The military has been in the process of mounting an offensive against an enemy that has previously attacked (and nearly annihilated) the human race, and they're looking for brilliant strategists to help the cause by recruiting/training gifted children.  In the end, they feel that Ender (and other children he befriends at battle school) are hopefully good enough to handle the task and trick (at least Ender) into almost obliterating an entire species into extinction by making him believe that he's playing a battle simulation.<br /><br />In the end, Ender feels horribly guilty (even though he was well aware of what he may ultimately have to do) for what he was a part of (even while the world treats him like a hero - at first), and he tries to make amends to what he did.<br /><br />I'm believe that Orson Scott Card wasn't trying to make the military look good in this book by showing that them as deceptive, extremely restrictive to it's citizens, and seemly fine with species genocide; yet there it is on the U.S. Marine Corps Professional Reading List.<br /><br />So my question is, why would the U.S. military approve such a book for it's military personal to read?  What is their motivation?<br /><br />Anyhow, putting these questions aside; I think the most interesting parts of the book worth discussion is the simulationgame that Ender plays while in Battle School.  This provides the reader with a peek into Ender's internal struggles and personality that I think the main story line never really fully reveals.<br /><br />Add that with some exciting (yet also fairly predictable) zero gravity games that the students of battle school play against each other (I mean, Ender's name is on the book cover so who did you expect to win?) and you have a highly regarded sci-fi book that is worth your time to read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg I found diamonds!!!! To find diamonds just go on creative survival or whatever then in seed generator put in jpgaming and then from spawn dig straight down from spawn to find diamonds
B003Q6D1YW|3.0|The show is better. I bought this cause my sister urged me to. Honestly it was kinda boring,but I really like the shows
B00B65ACJM|5.0|I talked several Thanksgiving guests into watching this movie with me, including my 99-year-old mother-in-law. I had forgotten the excessive use of the f-word. She quickly fell asleep and the remainder of us thoroughly enjoyed the movie. So many apparently unrelated confusing threads get under way early in the film, but they all come together at the ending in very satisfying fashion. The cast is loaded with great actors, and if you're inclined to be emotionally moved, have Kleenex at hand!
B003Y5H51K|5.0|I saw this in theaters when it first came out. The movie is great and keeps you on your feet. If you're claustrophobic you may get short of breath haha!
B009CGCQPU|5.0|Thanksgiving eve I went on a Jane Austen binge. Among other movies based on her books I watched three different versions of Pride & Prejudice. This one is by far my favorite. Keira Knightley works her customary magic. Matthew Macfadyen was quite a surprise. He plays against character with his massive physical presence combined with the subtlety of his acting. His character's discomfort in social situations is acute, making the ending superb. Overall the movie is very well cast, especially Donald Sutherland.
0770433782|5.0|amazing book!  pictures are so beautiful and writing are so heart warming!  Great inspiration for all the bride to be out there.
030726999X|5.0|I loved all three books.  Definitely keeps you up wanting to find out what comes next.  Only sorry he is no longer with us to write some more great novels.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Dissapointed, expected more from this movie. Denzel is a great actor, but this movie has a poor argument, I think i could be better if his relationship with Nicole went further. Still love Denzel!:-)
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I love the kindle app. It really is my go to reading source on my tablet.<br />I love being able to highlight, taking notes, and looking up any words I dont know.<br /><br />The kindle has quick downloads, and many many books to choose from. I love that I can still shop fro, the kindle store on my app. I shop for my books at different places and I receive tons of books from netgalley and am able to transfer them to my kindle app. Its just so convenient.<br /><br />There are tons of free books to chose from. New books you can sometimes seriously get them cheaper in here than from a bookstore.<br /><br />My only issue with the kindle is I wish I could transfer books ive read somewheee. Id like to be able to kinda organize them in some way. Otherwise love the app def. Recommend
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|When you find out what this book is about, you know it's going to be sad. It was sad........but so much more.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Its a great game that has been around for years.  It's User Interface controls are great and it has a nice look and feel.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|Excellent diversion! Keeps you wanting more.  Think you've not good at crosswords? This app will make you an expert! 5 out of 5.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|This product is a dude. It did not work with Xbox Kinect, The magnification optics were horrible IR could not see anything
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Patricia Cornwell never ceases to produce a page-turning novel.  This is typical of her work.  I will continue to read anything she writes and look forward to the next Kay Scarpetta novel.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I miss the one before I updated it!!! If you love you're old one please do not I repeat do not update it!!
B000XPOB0M|3.0|This is a movie where you love it or hate it. It's been a number of years since I've seen it, but it didn't seem as bad as others have made it to be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it love it love it..I can't stop playing it. I go on Facebook and beg for life like my own life depends on it. #superaddicted
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Great effects & cast! Love this movie!! Never a dull moment with this!! Liam is AWESOME & you'll be on the edge of your seat.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive game play.  However,  you have to wait a whole day to continue playing at certain points in the game, if not for that,  I would have giving it a 5star rating
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I thought this was going to be like Apple TV and allow me to mirror my display so that we could look at things together.  Unless you're watching movies, it is a complete waste of money and setup time!  I would expect something useful from Google.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|accumulated lives and extra points disappear for no apparent reason which is very frustrating when attempting to accumulate for redemption at a later time
B0081SRJSY|5.0|I first played the original board gamed and loved it. This game is fantastic.  I love it. I would recommend it to any game lover
B00594XOZU|3.0|This is truly an great app. It's having some big problems right now, so keep checking for updates! (That'll fix it probably) :)
B00C74SHRK|3.0|An interesting book but found it a bit tedious toward the end I enjoyed the read but it does not stay in the mind like other memorable books
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my son loves it he thinks its amazing&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he plays it all the time and hes only 3 its just sonreal and he claims it as a pet lol
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love playing this to pass spare time! Haven't had any glitches and its fun! I would recommend it for people who like animal games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This seriously is a great game. I had doubts about it but realized why people got addicted to it. Get This Game &lt;3
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was a great book but I think it's the same old story again Greg has a hard time getting a girlfriend and has best friend problems good book nothing I never saw before
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|this movie is wonderful.  it reminds me that sometimes we lose sight of what's really important...the person who's standing right in front of us.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love  this game it's freaking awesome I hope they make a number 2 so keep playing and live on
B001412W28|5.0|Great LA Band, but very polarizing. You either love them or hate them. I appreciate how many of their songs change music styles/genre in middle of song. For example, one song may go from Folksy to Metal to Pop to confuse the hell out of the listener (in a good way). This could also be a complaint by some. Very unique and I appreciate front man Serj Tankian. Big thumbs up from me.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Although this is a novel, the migration of thousands to California from the dust bowl happened during the great depression. It's gut wrenching to know how badly these migrates were treated at every turn. Steinbeck did a clear job of illustrating man's inhumanity to man in this book. It's clearly a book to be read time and again.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Great game, tons of fun.  Weird mix between Bejeweled  and Candyland.  Works great on the Kindle.  Beware- very addictive.  Also, it is free to download and free to play however the game shuts you out after 5 lives  and then you have to wait like an hour to get more and when you clear a certain area on the game board it makes you pass 3 quests and you must wait 24 hours in between each one. OR you can buy more lives and other types of &quot;power-ups&quot; to beat the levels which could get expensive if you're addicted enough.  So be careful!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I genuinely enjoyed reading this book, others had told me that the sex scenes could be overbearing since there were so many of them --however Ms. James' literary style kept me on my toes throughout the book.  I definitely liked it enough to move on to the next in the trilogy.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I absolutely love this TV series. All ten seasons are phenomenal. And this set is incredible.<br />But, this particular package is horrible. The DVD&#34;S have no protective covering whatsoever. They come in this very tight cardboard book. And when you take the DVD&#34;S out it scratches them causing the DVD to skip parts...not sure if I am going to keep this...<br />If you own the season already. DON'T BUY THIS
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I'm a great fan of Connelly and really enjoy his stories, he keeps me in the story .  My only problem is I read them too quickly
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Well written and very entertaining! Wish I had read this book years ago!<br /><br />Should be required reading for high school students!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Dark, unflinching slow motion mayhem. Urban is great as Dredd, and his sidekick was surprisingly well cast! I want to see a sequel asap!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After the mess of A Feast for Crows, A Dance of Dragons was a turn back to quality for Martin. While AFfC was plagued by lacking beloved POV characters and little story development, favorites Jon, Dany and Tyrion return, each with fantastic tales of their own. Still, the book is plagued by far too many POV characters, the worst returning from AFfC being Aero, who is just a pair of eyes. What shocked me most in ADwD was the re-telling of a scene from another character's perspective, the vast majority being exactly the same wording. I wish Martin would drop some characters, as mystery serves a purpose. That said, while I'd rather Cersei not taken so much of AFfC, everything there paid off with one of the most memorable scenes in the series in ADwD.<br /><br />The over abundance of viewpoints causes loss of story focus, but the many threads kept me wanting more. Hopefully all these threads lead somewhere. It feels like everything is coming together for The Winds of Winter to be as epic as A Sword of Storms. If you slogged through Feast of Crows this is a must read.
B004TI5N38|2.0|Must be me, but I found this book boring and it really dragged for a supposed thriller. The main reason I decided to read it is because the Puller character is supposed to be a lot like Lee Child's Jack Reacher. There are some similarities but what makes them different is the writing of the authors. Lee Child is a good writer and in my opinion David Baldacci is not. The dialogue's not believable, the interaction between the characters always seems to be angry. Perhaps the author feels that this adds suspense and tension but it really doesn't. Finally, the story moves at a snail's pace. Half-way into the book and Puller and Cole don't seem to do much except have breakfast, lunch, and dinner at the local eatery. My recommendation is to give this book a pass.
B00D3V97DO|4.0|Just a kick ass album.  Totally unexpected to get an album this solid at this stage in their careers.  If you like old Sabbath give this one a listen.
B005CS3VQ0|5.0|Very enjoyable read about language.  Both humorous and thoughtful.  The book I keep around to read when I have a moment here or there.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Great game..I have been wanting to play this for a while and was not disappointed by the wait.. Highly recommended
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I liked this book quite alot but it really was way to long.  The basic storyline was very good reading and it held my interest to the very end.  What I did not enjoy were the pages and pages spent discribing drug and alcohol induced stupors.  Tartt could have told her story in 500 pages rather than 700.  Her philosophy of life was interesting at the end but that could have been shortened also.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Amazing.  I liked it so much that after I watched it I bought it so I could watch it over and over again even when it ceases to be available on streaming video.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I've had this app for quite a while but the new update makes it skip and then crash. we need a fix asap!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a great movie! I never knew this aspect of the story. The actin was great and the dialog fast-paced & easy to follow. The climactic scene was a lite over dramatic, and not really believable but you can't fault the movie for taking some liberties in the name of entertainment.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have read all of her books and really enjoy the Scarpetta series. This writer keeps you wanting more even when the book is at the end.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Very cute movie!!! Love it!! Would recommend it to all the moms out there!! Would watch it over and over!!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Great plot, great characters, great camera work.  Exciting.  I've watched it several times and enjoy it every round.  Good for all ages.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I love this book. It is a very fun and funny book. If I could only have one book in the world, it would be Matilda
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a game great for all ages. It has an easy 2 touch control and gives hours of hillbilly hill climbing! There's tons of cars to choose from, all being available to buy through earned coins! Anyone who is bored on their device will get some fun with this app!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Corey is the most entertaining character I read.  Guess DeMill was a standup before he became a writer.  GREAT READ ,
0767817710|4.0|Great weird western from Evil Dead/ Spiderman director Sam Raimi. A terrific cast and terrific bunch of western archetypes. Gene Hackman is nicely over the top as the baddie who runs the town, Sharon Stone is a  sexy gunslinger out for revenge... Sexy REVENGE! Well, not that sexy, Leo D is a natural as \\"the Kid\\" ... The neophyte gunslinger out to prove himself.  And Russell Crowe is the killer turned Preacher forced to amend his past by taking up the gun again. It's gotta be the only film that Sam's '73 Oldsmobile Delta 88 is NOT in though... Maybe I missed it. But don't TOU miss this!
B00GNIOJNC|5.0|Has a very 80 rock anthem feeling to it. Lot's a great songs. Feel good music for sure. Worth buying !
B001R10BM8|4.0|Less embarrassing for Sean Connery than Moore's decision to make \\"View to a Kill\\" past his prime. An okay if loose remake of Thunderball, even including a white cat with more novel references like the old Bentley thrown in. Due to a dispute between Fleming and his screenplay collabators two studios made 2 Bond films the same year (the other was Octopussy) as a result  \\"Never Say Never Again \\" didn't have the real Miss Moneypenny, M, Q or even the John Barry theme. What it does have is Empire Strikes Back's director and Kim Basinger in her prime, Max Von Sydow as the Cat-toting head of SPECTRE. Connery's final return to the 007 role, better than his last return (Diamonds) in some ways too.
B007FH9GA6|2.0|If you like the books, or want to experience the entire trilogy watch the Swedish version. It is superior to the American version and has the options of English dubbing or English subtitles. I thought the American version was rushed and superficial and probably confusing if you didn't already know the plot.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Great book. I would suggest that you read it only after reading other books on the subject (Nothing to Envy would be a great choice). The thing is that this book, as a historic novel that it is, takes for granted that you know at least a little bit about what happens in North Korea...so if you don´t, you might not enjoy it as much as you should.<br />By no means it is complicated to understand, or boring in any way...on the contraty I strongly advise to read it.
B001S86J0I|5.0|If you're a serious STAR TREK fan, you'll rate this film top notch. Fans who like science-fiction and all others will probably rate it a star less. Tim Allen, Jason Nesmith, Sigourney Weaver, Gwen DeMarco, Alan Rickman, Alexander Dane, Tony Shalhoub and Enrico Colantoni have never been better! This is plain and simple one of the greatest parody films ever made, but again it's only the real Star Trek fans (the Trekkies) who will truly understand all the humor and appreciate it most.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The graphics are fantastic and it's cute and addictive, but the further you go the more expensive everything gets. I have been at a standstill for about a week because I have no more room to put anything. For more land, they want either an outrageous amount of ice age money or a high number of Acorns. I refuse to spend real money on Acorns. So I try to earn an acorn here and there when I can.  It's a very slow process. You may as well forget ever even being able to afford most of the animals in the higher levels. I'm not even sure why I have continued to play. I  would rather pay a few dollars up front for a game than to be &quot;forced&quot;  to spend real money in order to continue or grow your village anymore.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|Very cool book I think Disney should make more of the books into movies Arthur C. Clarke is a super good author
B00GX50ZC4|3.0|Movie was ok, but left a lot of major questions unanswered. The history if Apple was well done and interesting.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I  am very stressed right now in my life and this is helping me feel better and fall asleep faster then I would without this app<br />So that is why I am rating this app today for more relaxing tones to help me sleep in this chapter of my life right now
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Fast shipment...awesome movie. Purchased this Blu-ray for our family. Must buy and a great price. Can not wait to watch again. This movie is funny.
0767919408|5.0|If I didn't know that this actually happened, I wouldn't believe the tale. Constant surprises and delightfully told. If you like adventure stories there is no better.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat at the end of each episode.  Well written and acted.  A must watch.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third installment wraps up the series nicely but is slow to start. While the first two were page-turners, it took some effort to get into this one. Definitely a must-read if you've read the first 2.
B000IKQK7E|5.0|My daughter is 15 and we found out she had never seen Animal House. She laughed as hard as I did the first time I saw it.
B00FX8FQ76|4.0|While I find &#34;Roar&#34; a little lackluster (maybe due to overplay), the rest is another solid effort by Katy. Plenty of radio-friendly cuts.
B008JFUS28|5.0|Once again the want to be movie critics that give good movies a 1 star review need to kick rocks. Maybe you could go to the studio a pitch a better idea. These are the guys that buy tickets to a movie with a smirk and sit through the entire film finding errors or things they don't like. I loved the movie and can't wait to purchase the Blu-ray.
B00FHB7398|5.0|This game is very entertaining, well developed, and I didn't feel ripped off. Some games in this genre are so short that they leave a small inkling of buyer's remorse. This one is just the right length, and I plan on okaying it again on the advanced setting in the future. Would DEFINITELY like to see a sequel and would highly recommend trying this game
B0063GORYU|5.0|I got addicted to this game years ago. I have a disability of hands and legs so when the pain is bad, I have found playing non stop games of this helped to get my mind off of it..awesome!
B00160ZEEU|5.0|I'm sorry if my review isn't that helpful. Aspiring violinists don't have time to spend on the computer writing essays. But if Amazon persists in asking my opinion, here it is: ANY recording of Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic is a good investment! I love these recordings and I treasure the memory of Leonard Bernstein and Gerhart Hetzel (Vienna Phil Concertmaster). That memory lives on in these recordings! Did you find this review helpful? I hope so!
1451695195|3.0|I am not a huge fan of this book, it was a little boring for me.  I read it for a book club and during the discussion, it became more interesting.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Bought this after watching the video of it.  It was performed in 2007 and the group still has it!  This is vintage Zeppelin performed as well now as when they first recorded these songs in the 70s.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Very good plot, kept me guessing all the way through the book.<br />If I had one complaint it would be that there were too many characters, it was hard to keep them straight.
B001GQ2BNQ|2.0|Too many moving parts and leaks water in. Useless compared to the new TYR snorkel. The breathing tube and the mouth piece shouldn't have been separate.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|This is one great movie! From how it was made (what first attracted me to the DVD) to the Flash Gordon era storyline. AND Gwyneth Paltrow to boot!!!
B00632HWOG|1.0|I hate the new format.  I don't like that partial messages are visible in my inbox bar;  I don't like the ads across the top;  it is not as user friendly as the old version.  There is no underline feature.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I liked ABBA alot and now to have there music for the soundtrack AND the story line is great. Very creative and the cast makes it a hoot.
0374105235|5.0|Absolutely amazing book. Ishmael went through a lot and came out a great Guyana his books shows how that happened and what caused it.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|great game. difficult and long but it has a great story line.  worth the time and money. looking forward to the next one.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, but it is so frustrating to have over 200 moves and lives banked and they just disappear. Plus some people get easier playing screens and breeze thru the levels. it is an addictive game but I truly believe it is an unfair game.<br />I truly understand why a lot of people delete the game and stop playing it all together.
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|First off, very glad Boston produced new music.  Music usually takes time to really grow on you or fade out.  I gave it three stars for effort and I don't know if it'll hold up, but Tom and the band have put forth the effort and I appreciate that.  Every great artist has swings of creativity and they often don't know the impact or lack of.  Freedom is great.  We can say we really liked something or not, but constantly comparing everything they do to their first album is not beneficial.  Sort of like, &#34;Well, I think I'd like you if you looked and talked like you did in high school.&#34;  Same thing with Rush.  Dig the new stuff or let it go.  Give them credit for the efforts instead of vanishing with no new material.  Thank You Tom and Boston!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Jumps right into the action from page one and keeps you hanging on till the end. A heart and gut wrencher
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This enabled me to enjoy all the great books available for kindle on my Android.  I already have an Android tablet and the galaxy s3.  I didn't need another device, so this was the perfect option for me.  Reads perfect with all the nice features you would get on a Kindle.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this disc initially as it was quite expensive. However, after receiving this disc, it would rate it as a<br />great movie with exceptional quality, highly recommended for all ages and a blue-ray worth for keeping.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game LOVE it<br />It's so fun and it never freezes or gets blurry and I would really recommend to horse lovers or unicorns
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think that there should be a sanitorium dedicated to de-crushing the masses who are whacked out of their minds.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Nice mix of gameplay graphics.and resource management.  Not difficult to play but it takes effort to master but you will find it to be worth it!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Really good book. The first book, The Maze Runner is just a beginning, and it just takes off from there. Amazing book James Dashner!
B00G21XNKU|5.0|it did everything it should have done to honor 50 yrs of great cutting-edge science fiction. It captured the new and the old and brought them together seamlessly.
B000QEILLK|4.0|Another group from the Prog rock era. The Flower Kings weren't a very well known group but they still rocked. So If you  are a fan of progressive rock or just want to see what Progressive rock is This might be the CD for you.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Interesting issues of nationalism, terrorism, aging. Judy Dench is a pleasure to watch.<br />Always nice to know that the good guy wins.
B00000DFSK|4.0|A good collection of U2 music. So if your looking for a song from one album and another song from another album. This compulation of collective toons might just be what you were looking for
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good story.  The sex gets ridiculous in several parts, though (you get the feeling that it was written by a couple of 15 yo boys at times).  The book is at it's best when they are interacting in other ways.  Wife loved it and read it twice...  Husband spent time rolling his eyes and struggled to finish it once...  4 stars is the compromise.
B0002N4ZEW|4.0|Kind of a trippy album but there is a lot of really good music on this one. Porcupine Tree. Is one of the better groups of this generation. unfortunatly with the state of the music industry today their is alot of crappy music out there. So if your looking for a group that is one of the better Rock groups out today Pick up this album and get it from Amazon. No bidding and no bull. No waiting and hoping you didn't get ripped off from some of those bidding sites.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very entertaining...  He weaves the zombies into the real world of economics, politics, and life in general in such a way that it feels more like you are reading the headlines of a newspaper instead of a work of fiction.  Very we'll done.  And nothing like the movie....
B00006AW2J|5.0|Hey its the Rolling Stones What more needs to be said.  One of their best albums.  And it was hard to find but not here on Amazon. So when your looking for that hard to find music give them a try. Not much I can say about the Stones That most people don't already know.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Not quite as good as the others, but still a good read.  At times it seems like he is stretching the story out a lot further than it has to be.  I found myself thinking &#34;enough with the side tracks already...  Get him/her to where he/she is going...&#34;  But it does move the story along, and there some significant events.
B000001YOW|5.0|Another Good album for one of the better groups of today's music industry  Porcupine Tree is a Rock group that has a hint of Progressive music in their work.  So get your bargins here at Amazon. for quick and easy transactions you can't beat it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good book.  It's been a while since I have been able to finish an sk book, let alone haven't been able to put one down.  Danny's story is an excellent story of redemption.  The final battle is a bit anticlimactic....  You end up wondering why they were afraid of these people at all.  Danny and his charge are built up to a point where they are way more powerful than the knot combined.  But still an enjoyable read just watching Danny blossom.  You can tell mr King drew from his own battle with the bottle to fill in the details.  Almost would have been better without the  knot.
B009NF54ZE|2.0|stupid game, glad it was free.  I tried several times to find some interesting reason to play and finally dumped it.
B000002GJH|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest artistic collaborations ever recorded. Simply amazing from start to finish. The songs need no mention because of their greatness but I will simply say if you love Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice In Chains or any incredible grunge this lives up to the best. Say Hello To Heaven, Reach Down, Hunger Strike all epic but there are no weak tracks here. A powerhouse from start to finish. The double vinyl 180 gram version is fantastic and is one of the BEST sounding vinyls I own. Highly, highly recommended! I only wish it would have been a gatefold instead of a single cover.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book years ago but felt I needed to read it again. I hope the movie does it justice
B00C7CTYGK|5.0|Discovering this was really incredible and I cannot recommend it enough for any grunge fan. After three listens through I consider this to easily compare to the classics by Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice In Chains. Simply stunningly beautiful stuff here and I cannot believe I never heard it until recently. I have already purchased the vinyl and can't wait to crank it. My favorites include This is Shangrila, Stardog Champion, Bone China, Heartshine, Man of Golden Words (amazing!), Gentle Groove, and of course the masterpiece Crown of Thorns! Wow....just wow! It is amazing to think what would have been if Andrew Wood lived but we did get Pearl Jam Ten and Temple of the Dog both of which are masterworks...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Here is a young adult novel that doesn't hesitate to address the knowledge and fear of anticipating death honestly as well as with up-front teen-type humor.  It is not maudlin, but it doesn't skip any of the painful steps toward acceptance.  On the other hand, it gives the reader a true love affair and a chance to appreciate the parental love and support it's possible to give to a child who must, as we all must, leave.  John Green has a real classic here.
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|By far, one of the best Gilbert's book I've read till now. Very well researched, with interesting references and strong characters. Here is my blog review of the book, following the author's reading in Berlin: [...]
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A magical journey, highly recommend this book. A wonderfully written love story, I hope we get a story about Bailey and Poppit.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I have not read this story in a long time so when I found it I thought I would buy and compare with the classic movie to see how it compares
B000GKW4HG|5.0|A good size. Wonderful detail. We are new to collecting dinos for my toddler but I am loving these Papo dinos.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I'm a cat lover, and this quirky poetry is dead on. Isn't it interesting that all the affection we thought we were getting from cats turned out to have a different, sinister motivation? I loved the book,and the poetry is ell crafted.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|Got it for my grandson who is a Lego Minecraft fan.  He was able to put it together himself. He enjoys playing with it.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed the point of view of Charlie and found the book to be mesmerizing and entertaining and just interesting to see how deep the characters thoughts really are it has a lot of great life lessons
B009NF54ZE|3.0|this is a nice game but dear lord the talking!<br />once I found the skip button it is better but it has to be reset each puzzle.<br />other than that it is pretty good.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire but this app is nice to have on my Samsung Axiom. If i'm at the Gym I just pull this out and read a bit while doing some cardio.<br /><br />Nice thing is it sync's back and forth between my phone and kindle so I know where I left off on my last book.<br /><br />Apps works flawlessly on my Android  Phone
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I watch it at least once a year. It's a must see.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Good movie and funny, good childs movie. Has some really good parts that the kids love and laugh at can be watched several times
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|It is just as it was described on Amazon. I love it because it looks exactly like Daryl Dixon. I appreciate how I was able to track my item during the delivery process, and that Amazon texted me to let me know it had been delivered right to my doorstep. I love Amazon very much, they have a great system. I will continue to buy things through their service. Everything I've bought through them have been of excellent quality. I've never had one single problem. I love Amazon.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Daughter loves this and so do the bos.  Good movie with some god funny parts and kids can understand this
0316227706|5.0|This book makes a great gift.  I wish I would have thought of it first.  Enjoyable on the coffee table or on the shelf
B009D0LBRO|5.0|I mean I know some people might think 2.99 might be kind of expensive but... it's totally worth it! So buy it already!!!
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Love the game happy it finally came out for kindle fire. It's cool that I can connect my WBID for extra content for both games.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Could have longer daily bible readings,like the different versions, ease of getting to search the bible. Handy to have on you phone!!
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|I only give this 4 stars out of 5 because I want MORE! Great sound, exact vocals, interesting arrangements. Well Done PTX!
B00701L5XS|4.0|I enjoy having this app on my device, the old Fire.  It is fun to discover new knots, what they are used for, and how to tie them.  I've recommended it to a couple of friends that work in Scouting.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|It is what it is. A fun popcorn flick. Great tone and aesthetics. If you are a fan of anime, sci-fi, and fantasy, I believe you will greatly enjoy this flick like I did!
B0067RQYNW|3.0|It gets the job done and has a very polished looking interface but some of its features cause problems.  It does so much that one must discover many of its features.  I have files that I don't want open all of the time.  It keeps an open cache of many of the files you have been editing.  It takes a handful of touches that had to be discovered to remove the files from the cache.  This is a case where it tries to do so many things, that it loses in the ratings.
B008BQ8YHQ|1.0|The New Soap Opera<br /><br />The writing began to become a soap opera and far too liberal for my taste.  Get the writing back to solving cases.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Gruesome and awesome at the same time. Read it in 3 days, and now I'm looking for more from this writer.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I waited to read this book for a long time because it was so popular. When I did finally start reading it, I found it to be quite slow for the first 100+ pages, and I was not engaged in the story line at all. It finally picked up, but I still found it lacking in a few areas. I really had no strong feelings for either of the main characters, which is always an issue for me. I also found one particularly violent scene revolting since it dealt with animal cruelty. I am going to continue reading the series, but I wasn't honestly that impressed by the first book.
B008Q00PHY|5.0|great acting, great storyline, great actors, great ending, suspenseful, kept me interested during the entire movie, it's a must see
B00FAVRFXE|3.0|Amazon continues to piss off me and many other people with their pricing. I was ok with the price because I was under the impression that the docudrama would also be included.  The 50th episode was excellent but Amazon is really screwing people left an right, especially lately.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Great adaptation to the comic. It really has a dark undertone. You have to watch both Part 1 and 2 back to back so that you can get the entire story. It is worth it.
B006BXTOFC|2.0|The good news. It only cost $5.00. The bad news it totally sucks. Is there anything worse than hipster doofus playing rock and roll. And enough with the just guitar and drums already! Get a f-ing band! So dull I want Amazon to give me my $5.00 back. 2 stars because i reserve 1 star ratings for pop cretins like Beiber.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|great sound and tune. Their entire album is great, but this song is one that is always on my playlist
B0046179EO|2.0|I remembered these guys much more fondly than this thing actual sounds.There is a reason why these guys didn't have the pop credentials of the Beatles or even The hollies. They suck.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Best movie ever and so this edition really did make my day when they announced it. I was a little sad that the cowl wasn't full sized, but it is still great.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Many different functions, and the description is spot on. One drawback is the app can use the battery. But requesting a GOOD free flashlight app that doesn't drain the battery is like asking for a smartphone to have long battery life. They both exist, but at a premium. Highly recommended!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great read from Grisham. I highly reccommend it. Keeps your attention and moves along quickly. Can't wait for the next one!
034544678X|5.0|Such a well written, accessible and useful book.  We tend to relate to our dogs as extensions of ourselves, and of course they aren't.  Now when I talk to my dog, I pay more attention to my tone of voice than the words.  Of course they don't understand my language, this book helps me understand theirs.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The best game in the world, I tell you, it is addicting !! Every time I get a chance I'm holding my iPad just to play this untiring game sometimes I slept very late because of this game. Thank you..
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I thought this book was great.  I had no idea where it was going and I couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  It has been s very long time since I read a book that I didn't want to put down!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game really works your brain  was addicted with one game  makes you want to play it constantly love brain reassures
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|The film fell short. It was captivating at times, but it was a bit flat during most of film. Denzel is a gem to watch, but his magic couldn't bring the story to its full potential.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows ever!  Julian, do we always have to loose the ones we love?  A must see but ease bring the TISSUES!
B008HJGPVO|3.0|I find this to only be ok - I love the concept but it doesn't seem to work.  I wanted this for use with my Kindle Fire.  I thought the different size tips would help with playing games versus turning pages or surfing the web.  The tips stick to the screen ergo making the stylus awkward to use.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a fun little game, it also doesn't require the payment of actual money in order to advance in the game. Which is nice. This is a very good game to play when bored.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Beautiful, plus just the right mix of challenge and fun. I'm watching daily for Room 2 to come out so I can get back to playing.
B00594XOZU|5.0|What you have to do is to push the update button on the top of the screen. After you do that it should work
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Glad to see an old character again. Good to get caught up on what is happening to the characters
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This app is probably the best calculator app available for free. I would highly recommend this app to anyone needing a solid, general app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure about it, but the more I read it, the more I wanted to read. Before I knew it, I was on the final page. :)
B005R4KUZE|4.0|The application is simple, easy to use, and remembers the puzzles you've already solved.  They are good puzzles.  All of the puzzles are categorized into &#34;Normal&#34;, &#34;Advanced&#34; and &#34;Expert&#34;.<br /><br />I found one situation where the puzzle declared a mate, but the king had two escape squares so I did not understand the solution.  I also have the pro version of Analyze This installed, and that application revealed both of the flight squares have independent checkmates.  So, what was labelled as a &#34;mate&#34; was in reality a mate-in-two with solutions dependent on the flight square.<br /><br />I would really like to see this application go more into detail regarding the solutions.  If the solution is a mate-in-two, don't simply put &#34;mate&#34; in there -- it's too confusion for the people like me trying to learn.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Super-star of the nutritional world...<br />Everyone should read this book to find out what we have done to ourselves and how to fix it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This is a very good dictionary but as I said in the title, it's not the best. It has a huge variety of amazing words, but on my Kindle Fire HD I was not able to search for the words I wanted. Not even able to go to a certain letter! I could only guess where the letter was and skip to that point, or if I was on the letter I wanted, I had to skip super fast.<br />I would give 5 stars if I could search. But even though I couldn't search, it is a very good dictionary.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Loved this interpretation of the human experience! Even when the bad happens in life, it's good too know that your friends will always be there too back you and hold you up! Great lesson!
B00ESNE696|4.0|The Good Wife finally got interesting again.  I don't know why writers think that interminable relationship problems are entertaining.<br />In fact, those situations become irritating when they stretch months of watching, until finally I realize I just don't care.  Then I quit<br />watching.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|WOW!!! This book should have been sold under the &#34;horror&#34; section! A real eye opener! GREAT BOOK; very insightful! I don't normally read books like this but this book was not boring.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Interesting plot with lots of twists. I had a little difficult time getting into the story and characters, but once I did, I was<br />hooked! A very good story that I would highly recommend.
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|It is just a horrible game ho a tiny bit to much power you lose to little<br />power you fail. It is just horrible the dang game isn't fun it is just a pain in the butt.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|HORRIBLE ENDING! I wish I had boy wasted my time reading this series. Worst ending ever. So so so disappointed.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|This is a great movie. The development of the characters (from the first and second film) is interesting - I kept thinking about the transformation of Celine and Jessie since we first met them back in the 90s, and the more I thought about it, the more it made sense that they would be who they are in this third installment. Jessie's (E.Hawke) first broken marriage weighs heavily on him and makes him focused on a bigger picture - he wants to make his second marriage work. While Celine (J.Delpy), the once exciting, romantic girl has now been almost entirely consumed by daily battles, and caring for their children. The third part consists almost entirely of the two main characters fighting and it's so well written and fantastically acted that it is almost hard to watch. Partners say mean things to each other when they argue and this is an amazing study of (possibly) disintegrating relationship.<br />This is the best of the 3 movies, not fun to watch sometimes but very true and real. It stayed with me for a long time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Loved it!  Great to read about the characters from A Time to Kill. Absolutely moving and an eye opening story!
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|One of the best movies of all time with a fabulous cast of stars. One of Hitchcocks best. I remember first seeing this as a 7 year old on tv. It never gets old for me.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very much a time filler. If in fact it was a waste of time, I would not have played it multiple times. The only problem I had was with the screen sensitivity. On the puzzle using slide tracks if you use a stylus it will frustrate you when you lose the position and have to retrace (multiple times ). But stick to it and you'll find it rewarding.  Where is Room 2? Can't wait.
B000TGCR3I|5.0|I don't care for the style of the art and was fully prepared to hate this movie. The world class animation and unique, heart wrenching story make this a five star movie. If this isn't in your anime collection you're missing out.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is an amazing author.  Eat, pray, love was one of my favorite books, but this novel was even better than that.  Her descriptions and attention to detail kept me reading to find out what happens next.  Wonderful novel!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I saw the movie and was so taken I was compelled to order the Kindle version and began reading immediately. I was not to be disappointed. This may be one of the best books I have ever read. The characters are alive and believable. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in humanity. See the movie first.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|Boardwalk Empire is a mixed bag, typical of HBO's usual strengths and flaws. On the plus side, it sets its story in a fascinating and relatively unexamined period of history, the American 1920s, and focuses on types of people we are interested to know more intimately: the gangsters made prominent and powerful by Prohibition, the corrupt political bosses who profited from the illicit liquor trade, the agents sworn to enforce the law, World War I veterans, and the ordinary folk who lived through it all. The re-creation of the era's material and musical culture is extraordinary, at least to my layman's eye and ear. The acting is top notch all around, with some really_incredible_performances from little-known or unfairly discounted actors. So, what are the things that hobble this series?<br /><br />*Discordant notes become noticeable immediately. When even little things don't ring true, they undermine the verisimilitude of a drama. In the first place was the language. With the exception of an occasional 1920's phrase shoehorned into the dialogue, the characters speak exactly like modern Americans. And sure, there was profanity in 1919, but not like this, with almost every character speaking like the lowest ghetto rat from 2010. That wasn't necessary or historical. Then there were the sociological oddities: an Irish-Catholic Republican politician (named Enoch!) who was a darling of the Ku Klux Klan, and who began an affair with an immigrant, hymn-singing, Irish-Catholic temperance activist. Such ahistorical types may have actually existed, but all dramatists know that there are just some truths that would be laughed off the stage for being too far-fetched.<br /><br />*The plot quickly descends into desperate melodrama that would shame a Mexican telenovela. I suppose the writers simply had no idea where they wanted to take the story, so they habitually resort to every kind of salacious, over-the-top, meretricious plot twist: incest, pedophilia, parricide, lesbianism, assassinations, massacres, executions, gun battles, unexpected illnesses, torture, miscarriages, mutilations, bombings, adulteries, betrayals, sado-masochism, and the old standby, HBO's perennial obsession, whorehouses and naked prostitutes galore. This adolescent writing is all so gratuitous and contrived that it drags the series down to a level of almost cartoonish caricature.<br /><br />*Everyone, and I mean everyone, in this series is evil. Even the \\"sympathetic\\" character of Margaret has a false rape accusation, robbery, adultery, fornication, an abortion, and after-the-fact complicity in her husband's murder on her moral ledger. No one is really trying to rise above the mire, so what it all amounts to is a bunch of evil people doing evil things and trying to backstab everyone else. At one point it was hinted at that our protagonist Enoch Thompson might have some hidden moral depth when his mistress declares that it's her job to seduce him away from heeding the Catholic guilt that afflicts him every so often, but that plot development was totally discarded, leaving a completely superficial character who does nothing but pursue money and power.<br /><br />The series has enough to make it entertaining, with an all-star cast and brilliant cinematography and costumery, but maybe HBO should think about employing some writers older than 15 years old.ssinations, massacres, executions, gun battles, unexpected illnesses, torture, miscarriages, mutilations, bombings, adulteries, betrayals, sado-masochism, and the old standby, HBO's perennial obsession, whorehouses and naked prostitutes galore.

B00GII9UCW|5.0|beautiful album. i think billie joe was born to do this style music. loved the kinks remake green day made years ago.. never heard of nora before this album but she has a nice voice, and i will probably start listening to some of her stuff. if you compare the album with the original Everly brothers album, you can't tell a difference in some songs. always been a fan of green day, but this album just made me love them even more.<br /><br />update... i played the album for my mom, who is 64. she said she was very very impressed that something so good came out of Billie Joe's mouth. She said its a very pretty album but it still doesn't compare to the Everly Brothers. she said the two sound very good singing together
B009IU6BIS|4.0|Fun Christmas movie.  Haven't seen this one in years but it is fun to see again.  A Christmas tradition.  Thumbs up.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|It's a good show. Not as strong as the first two seasons but entertaining. I never thought I'd like a soapy period piece, but this has kinda grown on me
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Compelling drama with enough skullduggery to satisfy and keep you coming back for more.  Good character development, and superb acting.
B002N5N4M6|4.0|Love the show, not crazy about one of my DVDs having a skip in it. I didn't request a replacement because I'd had the set for a while before I discovered it. These things happen.
B00F880BWG|4.0|Very good season to the 1/2 finale - then they killed the best character and failed to kill the biggest bad guy (off camera gunshot - yeah) Show is fun but kinda like the whole zombie craze... it's starting to feel a little stiff in the weekly episode shuffle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was so intence. Way more then the last book. I like how suzanne added new characters to this book. And the ending, talk about cliff-hanger!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|A great book and start to the giver Trilogy. Three more books in the series. What a scary concept that societies could pull all these different worlds without knowing letting others except the higher ups know about the other ways. Wow scary thought. Couldn't wait to read nightly or anytime I had spare time. Made you feel right there with them and feel for all the characters. Just don't forget to also read the trilogy. You won't be disappointed .
0316055433|4.0|Tartt has been on the literary scene since the early 1990s, but I can't say that any one her previous works can hold a candle to \\"The Goldfinch.\\"  The story itself is extremely well-plotted, but the real gem of the book is Donna's style of writing.  Bordering on the abstract at times, this novel is filled with ideas, wonderful character development (Boris!) and character interaction--but it is this superior writing in combination with a beautiful story that make \\"The Goldfinch\\" such a prized read.  (You may also notice parallels with some Dickens novels as well as a Holden Caufield-esque feeling in Amsterdam)<br /><br />Essentially, a young boy, Theo Decker, loses his mother in a catastrophe rendering him a lonely orphan in New York City.  Theo manages to avoid being taken in as a city orphan by moving between nights on the streets and in friends' apartments, but there is a recurring theme of him being mesmerized by a certain painting which serves as a symbol of his mother and his loss. As Theo is drawn closer to the painting it is vividly felt that the art becomes all Theo has, yet still signifies all he has lost. It's almost as if he knows no other path than to jump into the painting and become a part of the city's underworld art scene. This is where obsession and the \\"white whale\\" come into play, but Tartt's version allows the conflict to occur in a modern-day, realistic fashion that brings readers so close to the story that Theo's emotions are felt first-hand.<br /><br />On the realistic note, I would advise that while the tragedy Tartt uses to set the plot in motion is fictional, it is extremely similar in the imagination to what actually occurred on September 11th of 2001.  I very much feel that it is important to understand how such terrible events effect us on the day of the event as well as in the decades to come equally, however I would warn that persons too close to this tragedy may have difficulty reading this story without recalling horrific events.  I certainly don't think this will hit everyone in the same way, I just wanted to put the notion out there to inform anyone who may not feel ready to dive into this kind of read.<br /><br />I very much recommend this book; it may not survive the test of time quite like the stories we read in high school, but it's so real and will definitely be a classic as well as an iconic piece.  My criticism of the book comes from the feeling that Tartt's talent is undercut but a lazy/quiet editor. The entire novel is undercut by lack of editing which completely disrupts the flow as well as creates a huge imbalance between the beginning and end. I don't know how many people can stay excited and satisfied through the very end in the existing print and think the novel would benefit from a reedit.  Still, I am grateful for good authors who can allow us to experience someone else's life and story so clearly, like an adventure in someone else's shoes.certainly don't think this will hit everyone in the same way, I just wanted to put the notion out there to inform anyone who may not feel ready to dive into this kind of read.<br /><br />I very much recommend this book; it may not survive the test of time quite like the stories we read in high school, but it's so real and will definitely be a classic as well as an iconic piece.

B00382S9N2|5.0|Such a classic, and this Blu-ray edition does a really nice job with the picture and sound given the limitations of the source material since it was a low-budget movie. This movie makes me so happy, and the box and book are nice quality. Recommended!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I want my old app. this one sucks. have to search through pages for my weather. remind me to never upgrade again!
B0029VT3UQ|5.0|This movie was unusual and had funny, sad, and thought-provoking moments.  There is nudity and sex scenes but compared to other movies, these are tame and well-done.  One of Kate Winslet's best performances.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is one of the most engaging that I have read in a long time.  The characters have deep definition.  The psychological/spiritual component is second to none.  This is a great book to spark a fine conversation.
B00G21XNKU|5.0|Doctor Who is easily one of my absolute favorite TV Shows.  I'm a huge sci-fi fan anyways, but its right up there with Star Trek, Firefly (Best Show to ever get cancelled before they finished one season), and Stargate.  These are just the specials, but they add so much to the main shows storyline!
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan has done it again.  A culture and character lesson from China  It's like taking a captivating college class.
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|real 007, lots of action... never a dull moment it is a classic James Bond.. get out<br />the popcorn, ahed of time you will not want to miss a minute.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I have not finished the book. I am only half way through it, but so far I am disappointed having waited so long to catch up with my favorite doctor.
0767836324|5.0|what's not to love about a story reminding a dry, driven numbers guy that he is the true Peter Pan. Dustin Hoffman as Hook is brilliant. It's great for the Holidays, or anytime you are tired of being a grumpy grown-up.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|It's a hilarious dark comedy and one of the characters is from firefly! realistic? probably not, but suspend that disbelief and you are in for a ride
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I love this film. I believe it's about remembering to feel, even when the feelings aren't so good, they are still invaluable. Excellent performances, high production standards and another story that can be watched over and over. What a good movie.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|It's fun and entertaining. One perk is that you can play it offline (no WiFi)! Great game for building and maintaining.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|came very quickly, was exactly how we thought it would be, lil girl will love it and can't wait to give it to her.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I took Spanish in high school long ago. This game like format is fun and allows repeat practices easily, and good tests to help you evaluate your understanding. Come on!  What do you have to loose?<br />FAST, FUN, FREE!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was easy to get wrapped up in this story. It keeps you guessing for a while which I loved. I was disappointed when it finally revealed it's secrets, only to be pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns that kept on coming. I had that bittersweet feeling when I reached the last page, the ride was over but the story had just begun.
B009TGODOK|4.0|This is a funny movie.  The characters are only slightly large-cut some of the time: mostly, they are believable.  The story is plausibly told and the actors play their roles well.  The subject matter is suitable for anyone over 16 years old.  See this film...
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Giving reason and worth to those of us who enjoy living in the quiet. If you're like me and enjoy the company of a select few rather than a throng of visitors; seek out alone time; need a daily &#34;recharge&#34; to keep yourself balanced; get overwhelmed by just too much going on at once; if ANY of those things describe you - read this book! Or if you love someone who isn't very talkative, doesn't take you up on your offer to go hang out with the gang, isn't high energy all day long, this book will help you understand them and value them for who they are.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This is a must have for the Nexus 10 and it charges faster than the micro USB. You can actually continue to use your table while it's plugged in and it will charge, unlike the micro USB.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This app is very fun and easy to use. I wish I could give it 5 stars but it uses so much of my Kindles battery life I have to keep it plugged in while playing. Which means no playing while out and about. Otherwise it's a very relaxing app that allows you to put together a wide variety of puzzles without taking up space or losing pieces.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|Please note, I did not purchase this disc from Amazon. I bought it new at BestBuy.<br /><br />This is a review of the Blu-ray disc itself, not the movie. I enjoyed the movie enough to buy it after renting it on a previous occasion. Not sure what the issue is because I experienced the same exact problem from a rented Blu-ray version of this movie. I ended up bringing the Blu-ray back to the rental store to trade for the regular DVD version.<br /><br />I load the movie into my Sony Blu-ray player, it spins, it does it's Blu-ray internet loading thing, it plays the Universal logo video clip, does more internet loading, then it just sit's there!!! I can't play it, I can't skip to the next chapter, I can't fast-forward, I can't navigate to the movie's main menu, I can't do anything except eject the stupid disc!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The same exact thing happened with the Blu-ray rental disc. It simply won't play no matter what I do!!! I hope I can get my money back from BestBuy.  :(<br /><br />*** Follow up ***<br /><br />As it turns out, a great many other people are having the same problem with this and other Blu-ray disc titles. Apparently, the fix is to disconnect your Blu-ray player's internet connection. After doing that, it should play fine. It worked! Now my disc plays as it should. WTF????
B001AIY58O|5.0|One day my (17 year old) kid asked me about the 3 sea shells because it was referenced on the internet.  It was kinda hard to explain.  I haven't watched this movie since it first came out on video (a looooong time ago).  I rented it for us and it was just as fun as it was the first time I saw it and the kid loved it.<br />Don't give up on all the older movies, some really didn't need the CGY to be awesome and this is one of them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great Books. Received them quickly and they really help improve my sex life with my wife.  Definitely recommend to couples if they want to have more sex!
B0081SRJSY|1.0|This is game is terrible. It's boring, simple, and repetitive. I don't understand the good reviews, but to each their own.
B0043D2LAC|5.0|bought 3, for different shooting assignments.  I attach it to the shoulder strap of my backpack.  I bough the S&F belt and shoulder straps, my 2 cents, waste of money.    it can keep a flash with cords, chargers, batteries.  it can keep a lens and filters in boxes.  it can keep everything i want handy without reaching for my backpack  It can keep a camera body without a lens, but not very practical for me.  It can keep EOS-M compact camera with a converter and a 50mm lens + storage for extra lens and batteries.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I purchased this after receiving my sis' 1st gen Kindle Fire 7&#34;.  After using her old cover for some time, I really wanted something more durable and...well...less pink.<br /><br />I found this cover and immediately liked the way it stands in landscape.  The problem with my old stand was that, instead of a stand with a triangle base and hard-case notch to secure the felt cover in a stable position, it stood like a tent.  After awhile, especially after (I assume) months of use, my old cover became way to pliable, and it became harder and harder to find that &#34;sweet spot&#34; angle to keep the kindle from falling on its face or back.  Anyway, that ISN'T THE PROBLEM with this stand!  So that was a major plus for me; as I didn't have to worry about shaking the table my Kindle happened to be on or accidentally bumping into it and having it fall.<br /><br />I also typed some notes on the Kindle, and at first, this cover didn't have that going for it, simply because the angle it gave me was really not working for my wrists.  So, for awhile, I was typing on the Kindle flat on the table, which hurt my neck.  Well, one day I just decided to try to turn the Kindle 180 degrees and slip the felt cover halfway into the elastic band, and see if that could hold strong, at least when I was typing.  Lo and behold, it held strong, and I could finally type at a reasonable angle!  Now, they don't advertise that, and it probably wasn't factory tested or whatever, so do that at your own risk.  It gives you a manageable angle between completely flat on the desk and the 45 degree angle that this cover normally gives you.<br /><br />The one thing I wish it had was a way to make it a portrait stand, but, if you wanted that, you really wouldn't be looking at this cover anyway,  since clearly, this particular cover doesn't have that option.  The hard cover is very durable, and the elastic band is tight, though honestly, I don't really use the band too much unless I'm traveling with it inmy bag all day.  Other than that, the installation and removal is as easy as it is advertised in the video, and I have no problems depending on it when I accidentally drop my Kindle on my kitchen tiles (I promise, that doesn't happen too often!)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I enjoyed the first two books, but this book was very disappointing.  It started with finding out what was beyond the fences.  It was quite a let down.  After that, I was pretty much skimming over much of the dialogue because it was very tedious.  I didn't find anything I liked about the new characters, all of whom are very one dimensional.  I hardly read the epilogue at all.  At that point I just wanted the book to be over.<br /><br />This book was so boring that I would be careful about even recommending the first two books to anyone knowing that the ending was so disappointing.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Another great book by David Baldacci, his books are a great read, once you start to read them you will not put them down until you finish them. He is a great writer.
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Great movie. Kind of what you'd expect, but the execution of the film is exciting, adventurous and gets your adrenaline going. I love the suspense in this movie! I'm not even into alien movies, but this movie really was pretty awesome, for ME.
B00EJ9RIXA|5.0|I have full access to my Google Drive with this app. It is very helpful for work and school work!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun!!!!!!  My wife has become addicted to this game.  It has enhanced her ability to use a mouse, good game!
B00GQ7OZR0|3.0|The show was trying too hard. The acting was flat, the characters unbelievable. Let's face it: Dexter was a serial killer. I hated the way both Harry and Vogel kept giving him these intense stares as though they were examining him for a science project. I also didn't exactly believe that Dexter should have gotten off, nor that Deb should, either, just because of their bad childhoods and their traumas. Granted, Deb ends up poorly.The show was pretty good up until last season, when it started going south and Dexter became so desperate about his kills that he'd have made mistake after mistake and would have definitely gotten caught. And not to be cruel, but there must have been a child actor available that was better than the kid that played Harrison! I do think Dexter's choice in the end was a noble one, though, although I did grieve for his loneliness and loss. But that kind of life has to have consequences.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|This thing said it gave me a virus so I deleted it and I had to download and antivirus program which didn't download
B0039O8AQK|5.0|Very realistic! A marvelous depiction of 2008-2013 so far.... I predicted it years ago, growing up in public schools made me appreciate the methods and power of the federal government to indoctrinate (dumb down) three generations of citizens to into the&#34; governments people&#34;.
B000002542|5.0|I heard Kohoutek a long time ago, but I never looked into the rest of this album. What a shock to hear such awesome talent. 80s Journey is okay, but this record is phenomenal, breaching into Mahavishnu Orchestra territory. &#34;Topaz&#34; is definitely one of my all-time favorites now, weaving between 70s cop-show-theme and almost fusion-jazz-like riffs. Amazing.<br /><br />I really can't think of words that may do it justice, so BUY IT.<br /><br />(why you would replace Rolie's voice with Perry's, I'll never know.)
B00AFROVQC|1.0|This is one series that you can avoid. Very shallow character development, combined with a completely predictable plot and pervasive spelling and grammar errors makes these books really hard to get into. The series should be named &#34;The 'I Owe You One' Series,&#34; due to this phrase being repeated so often throughout the books.<br /><br />In a large body of writing, a few spelling and grammatical mistakes are forgivable, but the quantity present in these books is very off putting. Whether it's the confusion of their or there, or our instead of are, each mistake is a burr in the fabric of the story, and there are just too many to ignore. There was also at least one instance where the author quite obviously used the wrong character's name. All in all, it's just sloppy.<br /><br />The plot is nothing you haven't seen before. It is almost possible to read the first page of each chapter, make some guesses as to what is about to happen, read the last page in the chapter, and confirm your assumptions. Everything in between is generic action and dialogue.<br /><br />These books cost very little for a reason, and even a couple bucks is a waste of money.
B004W4N55C|1.0|It seems to me the developer has abandoned the development of this app, or care less about compatibility with tablets.
