B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Let me ask you a question.  Are you somebody who thinks the freakiest scene in the Exorcist is when the little girl surprises her mother by walking down the stairs backwards like a spider and throws up on the floor?  If so, Mama is *certainly* a movie for you!  That is the scariest scene I've EVER witnessed in a horror movie.  The timing of it makes it scary because I certainly didn't see it coming, but also just the idea of a girl darting down the stairs in such an awkward way... TRULY a memorable moment of scary movie writing there!  Mama basically delivers in the same way.<br /><br />However with that said, I honestly didn't understand some of the storyline pertaining to Mama.  I get that two daughters lost their parents, lived alone in a house in the woods for 5 years, developed wild instincts, and had to learn to defend themselves from danger before being found, and I understand that this is a horror movie so for the sake of telling a frightening storyline, some kind of supernatural force had to be included to make the girls act differently from the average person secluded away for many years (such as the Exorcist example I mention above which is used here on quite a few occasions) and of course we know the uncle and his rock star girlfriend has to try and raise the girls the best they can (even though the girlfriend is less than interested in raising kids, and only doing so for the purpose of supporting her partner).  I didn't really quite understand why they had to live in a house picked out for them, though.  If they didn't live in this specific house, they wouldn't be able to raise the girls.  I can't speak from experience, but this doesn't seem realistic to me.  Even the girls friend comments that it's weird.<br /><br />All this stuff makes sense to me, but what I don't understand is all the stuff pertaining to the Mama entity other than she developed a trust with the girls while they were secluded away and living on their own, and that she can control them through fear and supernatural ways.  The girls understand Mama's behavior as well as Mama knows their behavior.  They've developed an unbreakable bond I guess you could say.  What really frightens me is when you see the Mama demon standing quietly in the background and then she suddenly RUNS or floats directly in front of the camera!  This movie works amazingly well combining both psychological and jump scares.  You obviously jump when Mama suddenly darts across the room, but it's really mind-twisting when you see what Mama's face looks like and the way she moves on the walls and inside the floorboards.<br /><br />Also, the dream portion of the storyline that the rockstar woman has with the stabbed nuns and the screaming baby... I can't recall the last time such a realistic portrayal of a dream actually occurred in a movie before, if ever.  This is *exactly* how I dream, with one scene immediately shifting somewhere else in the blink of an eye that feels like a perfectly natural transition even though it's not.  In this case, a woman appearing in church and then suddenly appearing outside holding and running away with a baby in her arms.  The exceptionally bright background while all this is going on is incredibly realistic and reminiscent of a dream as well because in dreamland, everything looks brighter (or darker, depending on the cicumstances) than in reality.  Excellent job by the people who created this segment!  Now do I know what this segment actually means pertaining to the storyline?  Not really.  I have my ideas however.<br /><br />While quite often it's understandable to poke fun at Hollywood's exaggerated and unsatisfying attempts at movie writing these days (especially when it concerns horror) Mama is a movie that actually gets it right mostly because the film executes in all the key areas.  It has atmosphere, wonderful timing, children often moving awkwardly in dark hallways effectively sending chills through your spine, the Mama character never appearing while the parents are around for quite a bit of the storytelling during the first half, and most importantly, the Mama character herself is EXTREMELY frightening due to special effects that can only be described as otherworldly and highly unusual.  These are the kind of special effects that remind viewers what it is they love about scary houses.  While the lack of compassion between the rockstar girlfriend and the two sisters may be a sign of bad acting, and even though I may have misunderstood Mama's decisions (without spoiling it) during the final 20 minutes, it doesn't change the enjoyment, fear or fascination I felt leading up to that point so I must give in and award the film 5 stars.  It really left me satisfied.  Hollywood got it right for once!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book has a amazing message to kids and adults of all ages. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good story is not afraid to cry a little.
B005544TRQ|4.0|This show is clever and well written while still being lighthearted. It probably wont win awards for being the most thought provoking but it is one of the better shows on TV right now. More of a light watch for intellectuals it is smart and has some great one-liners.<br />Overall, a great way to spend a saturday afternoon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Makes want to never put it down. Excellent read. Can't wait to read the third book in the series. Awesome!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This is a Fun game.  It is easy for me and my son to play together. He enjoys the time together
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Was for my husband and he loved it. He actually got all of the seasons. He watches them all over and over.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Okay, so wanted to use this at work but didnt support WPA2 with certificates. Was hoping it was device direct but it really needs the wifi network. Also lack of apps to use it and Australian content.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use the bio rhythms and I sleep so soundly. I wake up refreshed and ready the next day. I also play with the sounds rain and storms. If your looking for an app look no more. Worth the money!
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|I tried to like this movie, but since I had read the book first, I was deeply disappointed in this adaption.<br />Half of the story was missing, like, really important parts and half of the characters were missing.  Again, really important ones.<br />Had I not read the book first, I may have given this movie 3 stars, since it was just not well written.  I don't see how anyone who hadn't read the book could fully understand what was happening.  There were giant plot holes, huge events with no explanation, random characters that were supposed to be major players just popping in and out with no introduction.<br />So much of the book was missing.  And I don't mean silly little things.  I'm talking, the biggest stuff.  The dance, Marium, Ethan's dad, the birthday party, the song, Ethan's mom, Amma's real character, Boo Radley, the sisters,  the explanation as to the significance of the locket, the Angels....<br />I can't believe the authors of this book were ok with this rendition.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is really cool because I've been waiting and searching for a cool free online game like this. So if you like attacking bases this is the game for you.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Bob M is an original and follows nobody. He is internationally acclaimed and copied worldwide. His music genre (Reggae) has its roots in West African sounds and instruments. Had this one since this summer but followed the artist since he was an obscure group leader (The Wailers) in Jamaica, WI. This is a short story or the life of Bob Marley that's very entertaining and informative.
B001HN690O|5.0|This is a great movie for the entire family. An excellent sequel to the first film. We have had it over a year now and we still are watching it. A family favorite.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game. So happy Amazon offered it for free on the kindle fire HD. Haven't had any issues so far, but sure wish we'd have more lives.
B00F35BV64|2.0|OK, but not great.  Glad I didn't pay full price movie tickets to see it.  I would recommend it for a home movie evening if there is nothing else to see.
B0001I561E|5.0|My children and I love this move and it has allowed them to see this amazing kid movie plus it allowed me to see actually all the adult humor in it as well.
B003Z8S3AS|5.0|Good stuff. Used to listen to it on the way to work at NAS Dallas where I was an aircraft electrician and a Loadmaster on the C9B .
B007EC27QM|5.0|It is so much better than the built in calculator app on the phone. The ability to calculate tips is awesome and also to view past calculations without having to recalculate the number each time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is the best game ever! I love this game. It's very addictive, and some levels are very challenging.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|It was a great movie to watch with my older kids.  My four, 11 to 14, said it was surprisingly suspenseful, fun and thrilling.  I found it a good father mentoring son film. I hadn't had a movie thrill like that since I saw the 2011, Rise of the Planet of the Apes.<br /><br />Now, that I've seen the movie, I would say there was definitely an unfair bias against this movie from the press.  It's worth the watch. As a side note: I am glad Shyamalan is still making movies that hit on a deeper explanation of human experience.
B00FPH6M82|1.0|The CGI was pretty cool but the story line was very predictable. There was some very corny scenes like Will Smith's character saluting Jaden Smith's character at the end. Really? The change from serious cadet to scared kid to ghosting did not follow a logical sequence. Not a good movie.
B0035LMTZA|1.0|This is a mini-cooper promotional commercial labeled as a movie. Unlikely/Horrible plot line. Movie was made so you can be \\"impressed\\" by the mini-cooper and go out and buy one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an excellent game-one of the best. What I love about it is that I can do it at my own pace. Extremely challenging also!
B0012QTT4O|5.0|i ignored this series for years. a moth ago i decided to check out the pilot of season one. hooked every since.  i just wished the series kept going. all good things come to a end heh?
0316067598|5.0|A life changing book. Hooyah!!! Finally a great accounting of a special group of warriors that have been long forgotten.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Bought this for gft for my grown son. He tells m everything was perfect. Arrived just in time for a little r and r on a fall day :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldnt put the book down. Excellent sequel. Here is King at his best!  Loved it - the creepyness and all. If your  King fan, a<br />must read.
B0014YVC6W|5.0|The three most iconic movies of the past 100 years:  It's a Wonderful Life, Schindler's List, and Short Circuit. Johnny 5 is one of the most notable characters post-industrial revolution. His bubbly sense of humor combined with his razor sharp wit create the perfect storm for a memorable and epic gold screen performance. He can be credited with single-handedly winning the cold war and ensuring those pesky communists were kept at bay. Johnny 5 has been described as the &#34;Normal Rockwell&#34; of our generation, and his on screen chemistry with Ally Sheedy rivals even Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet from Titanic. This movie will literally change your life and give you a different perspective on everything from doing laundry to pumping iron at the gym. If only the government would invest money into Nova Robotics instead of fixing our pesky social problems, we would truly be that great nation on a hill that our founding fathers spoke of. My advice to you: sit back, relax, and prepare to absorb input of your lifetime. I will never be the same after watching this movie...
1442358238|5.0|I have always enjoyed her stories but this one has been one of the best.  Definitely worth listening to or reading.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|*SPOILERS: Great opening episode to the new season showing Rick still struggling with the ghosts of Laurie and a really expensive - &#34;big&#34; set piece scene with the (now much larger) group in a shopping mall. Looking forward to the next episode tonight!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a fantastic read! I was so involved in the story that I couldn't put it down! I was in such a hurry to find out what would happen that I read it very quickly. I intend to read it again. It's a very creative story, I've found a new favorite author !
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Let me just start off this review by stating, I adore Will Smith and I have never not liked one of his movies before now.  Ouch!  This film was extremely painful to watch from the beginning to the end.  The story line doesn't make sense, it's pretty much a two man movie through most of the show.  The effects are great but not worth sitting through this film.  This would have made a better video game than a movie.
B002RMVAZ8|1.0|I'm sure that it's a good movie, I just don't want to work that hard to understand what is being said. A more modern English translation would be more up my alley.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great follow up to the Shining and a great book all on its own.  I could not put it down!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Pretty dang good.  Not life changing but def kills time gracefully.  I love her character and its not so involved that you need to catch every aecond
B007IXWL2C|5.0|OMG!!!! What a wonderful read. I've just finished the Fifty Shades Trilogy. Although they were purchased separately, once I started I couldn't put it down. I will definitely recommend the entire Trilogy. Way to go E.L. James. Can't wait for the movie to come out.
B002LB13SE|4.0|With stellar acting, a realistic plot, and graphic special effects. Makes this movie one that you will not soon forget!
B0041KVWI4|5.0|Well i loved it! I understand that the cover art it completely ugly to add to any collection but hey I was looking for great music and this is what i got!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THIS CRAZY GAME!!!!!!!!!!! I'm so happy it's on my kindel now. Waiting to tell some of my friends that they can now download this game.
B00D8HNQZI|2.0|just well if your are looking for something ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC perhaps get &#34;how to destroy angles&#34;.. sadly i didn't get what I wanted out of this one personally my star rating seems to show my enthusiasm
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app...the levels are challenging but not so frustrating that you give up without finishing.  I found it very enjoyable, and it's been a good time waster!  Looking forward to more levels!!
B00EQF2EIG|5.0|First off, I'm not a Shakespeare fan, but I am a Joss Whedan fan so I had to try this out. The dialogue is Shakespeare's, but the setting is modern. The actors are mostly people from Whedon's TV shows.<br /><br />This movie has everything - humor, villainy, buffonery, romance, drinking<br /><br />I saw it originally in the the theater. For some reason, I struggled with the dialogue in the theater. Everyone said you get used to it after about 5 mins, but there was a fair amount that I just couldn't quite get. Don't get me wrong, I fully understood what was happening in the story but some of the lines escaped me. In the theater I guess the language stressed me out a little at the beginning, but when the cocktail party started, I settled back and relaxed and thoroughly enjoyed the show.<br /><br />I just recently watched it on my TV and had no trouble with the dialogue. I don't know if there was a sound issue in the theater or if seeing it once before prepared my brain to accept the language, but I was able to understand everything on the second viewing.<br /><br />I know it was filmed in just 12 days. You would think that it would look like it had been thrown together, but it doesn't! Joss did a wonderful job and I don't think anyone would ever suspect that it had such a small budget and short shooting time.<br /><br />The actors did a wonderful job with this movie. I especially think Amy Acker deserves an Oscar. Clark Gregg, Reed Diamond and Nathan Fillion were all excellent as well.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert: The one thing that bothered me was at the wedding when (in modern times) Claudio was beyond upset that his fiance was not a virgin and her father would rather she die than to bring such disgrace on him. This part really didn't work for me in a modern setting although the fact that Claudio saw her apparently betray him on the night before the wedding added some credibility to it. That was the only part that I struggled with. On my second viewing I really didn't give it another thought.<br /><br />Frankly I'm hoping this little movie gets several Oscar noms.ive it another thought.<br /><br />Frankly I'm hoping this little movie gets several Oscar noms.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I only give this 3 stars because my grandkids really like it.  I thought it was stupid, and the acting was terrible.  And I REALLY like all the actors in it, but it just didn't seem to &#34;click.&#34;  Oddly enough, the grandkids like this one better than the original &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34; which I can't understand at all.<br />It's worth a watch if you have kids or grandkids 7 or under; the older kids will probably be bored.
B00ECTZKJ6|3.0|I love KoRn and have the utmost respect for them. They are incredible musicians and I'm so glad Head has rejoined the band. If you enjoy this album, I am glad to hear it. But personally I can take it or leave it.<br /><br />A lot of people are saying that Korn isn't afraid to explore new ground, and that they are pushing into new territory on this album, but to my ears it sounds like they are sticking to the same territory they've lived in for a decade. I don't mean that in a negative sense, because if you like that sound, then you are going to love this album. But for me, none of the tracks stand out. None of them get me out of my seat and make me want to move. I don't find myself wanted to go back and listen to again. I don't hear any new tricks that I haven't heard them use already on past albums. I've already forgotten about this album personally.<br /><br />But the band is free to do what they want, and I'm glad they are still making music.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|I knew I was going to love this one when I saw the previews, and boy, was I right! Great action movie, this one grabs you 5 minutes in, and doesn't let go till it's over.  My only complaint, and it's a very small one, was that it was another zombie movie.  I'm getting kind of zombie'd out. But the really good story and surprise ending made it well worth overlooking the zombie factor. I bought this one on Amazon.com because I watch it a LOT. Nothing make doing laundry easier than having a good movie to watch while you're folding, right? Definitely a winner in my book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun I would recommend it. I just wish you did not have to wait so long to get more lives.
B00COHAUD4|5.0|I really like this movie. Creeped me out big-time, and that's hard to do. Special effects are so good that they look real, and the two little girls were great. Much better than Pan's Labyrinth. If you liked &#34;The Grudge&#34; or &#34;The Ring&#34; you're gonna love this one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad that I can finally play this game<br />it is so much fun I love it love it
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Wow....Just WOW!! This was an amazing experience!!! My grandchildren, ages 5, 9, 11, and 16, ALL watched the whole thing, and loved it.  Plastered across a 60&#34; flat-screen, it was almost like being at the circus.  The little ones watched it twice again in the time we had it rented.  Beautifully filmed, amazing acrobatics...just a real treat for the family. Couldn't recommend any higher!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Amazon has candy crush....<br />Just it pauses sometimes...<br /> like a sec or two...<br /> other then that awesome...<br />I'm be playing this game all day
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This was just a fun movie, from start to finish! If you like magic, you'll love this movie. Good story, good acting, great visual effects, and a really nice ending. Very entertaining; this will become a favorite in my house.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!! Be aware, though...it IS addictive! I'm glad that it is on Kindle. Now I'm waiting for Papa Pear. It's even better!
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Loved this movie...from the great special effects to the ending twist, which I did NOT see coming.  Visually a treat to watch, and a good story.  Wish Amazon would sell it for a reasonable price, though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome. Love this game. It is so addicting I can't put it down. When is candy crush two coming out ?
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I love this movie, and don't make the mistake I did, I saw this on TV and like it very much, but big surprise when I got it home and watched to find out that they cut the movie up on TV. Very happy that I bought it!  Don't always believe that your seeing everything in a movie on TV.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cool game u should try it out it is fun try to enjoy it because u mite like it or not but it depends on u not on me o well hop u enjoy this game!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am very happy with this movie, just got the second one and needed the first one to complete my set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have it and I played with my little sister and she ask for the the app title for she could get on her iPhone I think it's a good app for any age.
B00F2362IE|1.0|this game locks up and freezes constantly  ... it needed more time for quality control, everyone that previously purchased should get their money back or get paid for being a game tester
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I tried to play this app but it froze my screen. Than I went to my home screen and it was there on half of my screen. I had to turn my kindle off and than turn it back on.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Funny and imaginative. Beautiful scenes and brilliant colors. Great for whole family. More entertaining than I expected from the previews.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This is my favorite Grisham novel ... the number of characters was kept to a minimum which seemed atypical but MUCH EASIER TO FOLLOW ... the story is intriguing and deeply moving. Loved it!!!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have been using this on my last 2 phones, like it so much that I bought the paid version.<br />SwiftKey rocks.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a great ride ... unexpected twists and turns ... one of my favorite Grisham novels ... you'll love it!!!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|LOVE this game! I was sad to finish the first one, until I saw an ad for this one while playing the first one again! I love this game, keeps you entertained for hours!  LOVE that there is easy, medium, and hard now, which means I can still play after finishing one of those levels! Keep them coming guys!
B00FJTWK0U|4.0|The writing was insightful regarding the many conflicts people experience in a marriage. Hawks and Delpy delivered great performances as well!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Great book that really made me think not only of myself, but how others interact and how to bring out the best in them. I resonated with many of the concepts, and they helped me communicate with my wife (the extrovert). There were some areas that I didn't necessarily agree, but even those areas were well written and thoughtful.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|We just got our tablet a few weeks ago and my husband downloaded the Kindle app for androids last week.  We already had a Kindle touch, so now we can both read e-books.  I like that we can load the books we purchase to both devices.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love the book like the moves hope there's more to Nessie n Jacob tho that would be great thank you
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started this game and just getting the hang of it. Hopefully will enjoy it. So fat looks like fun.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is ok. Everything is completely random. You could be stuck on a level for months just so u spend money to pass it. My wife is super addicted to this game so I figured I would try it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Like the fact that I can get the weather at a tap. Don't have to wait , and it up dates itself.  Thanks!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It does my sweet tooth good.  Lol..... seriously l have not had this much fun since the candy land board game.  It is fun for the whole family.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|In all honesty I went through many emotions watching this. You go from being irritated at how gullible Nev is to understanding when you see how elaborate Angela's lies  are, to pissed at Angela and wanting her to get caught to meeting her and having pity on her that a woman would go to such lengths to create a fake profile, then you see her life and sort of understand why she gravitated to Nev and didn't wan to lose him. I ended up feeling bad for both Nev and Angela at the end because they both were looking for someone else to complete a story that never was. You will definitely have a lot of conflicting thoughts after watching this film.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game and I'm glad I can now play it on my kindle fire. Thank you for it.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I've lost over 250 pounds and I totally agree with what Gary says in his book. I was addicted to sugar and even had gastric bypass only to start gaining again. when I once again found myself morbidly obese, I knew I had to do something. I hadn't read any research on sugar addiction but I knew I was addicted. If an alcoholic could get free by not drinking alcohol, maybe I could get free by not eating processed sugar. And so I began the journey towards freedom. I stopped eating sugar and then stopped eating gluten as breads were a major downfall. I was successful and feel free from the pull of sugar and breads. My journey is chronicled in my memoir released on Oct. 23. Sweet Grace: How I Lost 250 Pounds and Stopped Trying to Earn God's Favor.<br /><br />I read Gary's book after writing my memoir. But had I read it before I would have quoted it extensively. I have experienced the truth of what Gary writes about. A must read for any morbidly obese person.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read The Shining 35 years ago.  Dr. Sleep brought back all the memories and anxiety like I had read it last week.  It was a fitting sequel to, in my opinion, the best horror book ever.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this app. The games are relaxing, relatively challenging, but still easy enough. When you make three incorrect choices you start over. Nice scenes are ncovered when you. Complete a level. Highly recommended. I will consider more in future.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a fun and super addictive game. I only wish that the items to collect to complete the collections was somewhat easier.
B005544V6A|4.0|I was curious about this show since it first came on but I miss the first episodes so was resign to getting the dvds from Netflix. Just join prime and was glad to see I could stream the series - didnt know what to expect but so far I really enjoy the show - its a different take on lawyers average guys becoming lawyers - so far I watch half of season one - looking forward to the rest of the episodes
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a fun game, from an AWESOME MOVIE. and it is free, WOW it is sssssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooo fun to play
B00FPH6A70|5.0|I loved this movie!  It was one of the best movies I have watched recently.  Kept me watching until the end!
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|First... the action was terrific as were the special effects and the acting.<br /><br />That being said, this new incarnation of ST is getting to be very irritating, so much so that I can't really 'enjoy' the movie. The romance between Spock and Uhura sets my teeth on edge.  And they bring back Khan? Are there no writers left in Hollywood or are have they all gotten so lazy that they have to drag out this character and his minions from the mothballs instead of giving us an original storyline?<br /><br />Every year, original novels are published from the STOS, STNG, DS9 and ST Voyager universe.  I know this for a fact because I purchase most of them.  The powers that be couldn't 'glean' an original storyline from any of those novels if they were unable to think up one on their own?  And the technology? This is supposed to be in the year or two before the 5 yr exploration trip begins.  At least the tv series 'Enterprise' made some effort to not be too advanced technologically from the original STOS.  And.. McCoy's little elixir that he cooked up from Khan's blood should be raising the dead all over the galaxy from now on. And with 72 'supermen/women' on ice (literally and figuratively) to draw 'enhanced' blood from, no one should ever die again..lol..  It all seemed very contrived.<br /><br />And Vulcan being destroyed with most of it's population in the first movie?  I thought they might do something to set that right in the second movie but nope... it is still gone. It seems to me that this whole new franchise is creatively lazy and sloppy with their story lines.  And that knock-off of Kirk in the isolation chamber and hand print and Spock being on the outside looking in on Kirk?  Just weird... really weird and not the least entertaining or engrossing, unlike the original scene with positions reversed from the movie \\"The Wrath of Khan\\".<br /><br />And, pray tell, how fortuitous that the Klingons showed up on the surface of Kronos right on schedule so Khan could take'em out practically on his own but the crippled Enterprise hung out there for how long??  And the Klingons had no clue and never showed up to check out this Federation starship close to their space?  Highly unlikely.  And the Enterprise could contact Scotty in a bar on Earth from 'way out there'?  Boy, communications have sure improved, haven't they?<br /><br />I guess this ST universe had no missile defenses or fighter planes (what would a civilization that could put a star ship in space have for homeworld defenses?) in place to stop a star ship from careening to earth, right? Like I said... sloppy and even somewhat silly!<br /><br />And the Enterprise being underwater but couldn't move under water closer to the volcano to try to rescue Spock?  Or.. move underwater furthur out, away from the eyes of the indigenous population when it decided to get out of the water?  Khan could transport all the way to Knosos but they couldn't get Spock out of a volcano with their transporter? And how did Khan and Kirk land on another ship thru it's shields?<br /><br />There were a lot of other inconsistencies but.. maybe I am being too nitpicky.  I miss the science and the moral quandries that used to drive the old ST.
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|It was okay... Not the best movie, but not the worst.  It had it's funny moments, but I would have liked more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Good stuff. Works great. It does what it says. It'll get even better over time. I look forward to more apps.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm not a game person at all but Candy Crush is the exception. It's so fun and it's very easy to get hooked on as you advance levels in the game. The graphics are very fun as well. There is a reason thus game is such a big hit!
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Definitely funnier then the second. I didn't think it would be good, but it was awesome! Chow makes the whole movie for sure. Zach G is pretty amazing as well
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I enjoyed it! Great seeing These actors in something out of their normal genre! Story was what I expected, monsters and robots but overall great movie.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found it difficult to put down. It is virtually impossible to figure out the plot until the very end
B009LDCXNY|5.0|It arrived sooner than expected which made watching it even better! I've been watching this show for the last 10 years & it never gets old. This season was great. It's getting crazy & now I need the 9th season (:
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|Scary, as this could happen anytime soon.  Story is way ahead of it's time from when it was made so many years ago.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Very informative, a well told story,esp moving through the last twenty years of genetic research.  Would recommend to anyone interested in cancer.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Aslan has performed a broad synthesis of the non-Biblical history of Jesus.  Countless authors have documented historical realities of Roman Palestine during the time of Jesus, and Aslan weaves these historical threads together to fill in the skeletal Biblical narration of Jesus life, including the discrepancies among the gospel stories. Did Jesus clear out the Temple at the beginning of His ministry (the Gospel of John) or in the last week of his ministry after his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Matthew, Mark, and Luke)?<br /><br />Those who hold a literalist view of the Bible will likely be close-minded about Aslan's book, but those who are willing to explore what is not said in the Bible about historical figures, Temple politics, and capital punishment if criminals will discover much to think about in this book.<br /><br />And do take the time to read the chapters of footnotes and references.  You will find significant discussions and disagreements with explanations why Aslan chose the arguments he presented.  This is not a scholarly exposition perse, but he provides the wealth of the labor that went into Zealot.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game , if a little short. With my memory all I must do is wait 3 days and I will have forgotten where the puzzles are. Also the price was great. So yes I would pay for more from this company. Enjoyable.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth and World Without End by Ken Follett I just had to try the category &#34;Historical Romance&#34; and was not disappointed when I finished the first book in the Outlander Series.  Although time travel did not really appeal to me in theory, the perspective of the 1500-1700's in early Scotland did. I have now completed four of the books in the series and am just starting on the fifth.  Both Jamie and Clair are fully developed characters that give scope and range to the times.  The essence of values, dedication and honesty are tested and validate the feelings of each character.  Feelings that are prevalent in everyday life. I really think that Diane Gabaldon has done a good job in researching the eras and has lead me to investigate and explore more actual historical events within the period.
B00FN811SY|5.0|I love the library. The ease of reading and understanding the divine word is such a joy. Using the appendix and maps brings the Bibe accounts to life. A must have.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Silly, addictive, trying....all of the above, and a bargain price as a bonus...who could ask for more?  The only argument comes when everybody wants to play at the same time.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I pray that the media and leftists would let these elite warriors do whatever needs to be done...it is a tragedy that lives are lost due to this type of thinking..war is ugly......that is a fact...
B00D6M86RS|5.0|Mixing old pinball feel with Marvel characters, this game brings fun, laughter and adventure back to the current era in this classic game.  Get your game on, gathers your skills and warm up your fingers...this one will take you on a wild ride.
B003U69IX6|2.0|No real depth to the story. Character development is missing. Seems to jump from one incident to another with little rhyme or reason. Our showing was marred by losing the signal from Amazon (all our other connections worked, so we know it came from the source), so maybe the story gets better, though I'm not enthused enough to find out.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Happy kindle customer to finely be able to play Candy Crush. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because it will not allow me to connect to Facebook. I hope this will be resolved. Other than that everything else was great. I am sure looking forward to playing with my friends. Thanks for all the hard work to make this game.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|This is a fabulous Yo Yo Ma CD.  I have listened to it while driving, working, cooking, cleaning, dining and I am still amazed and entertained.  I would highly recommend adding this CD to anyone.  I have introduced it to my 2 yr old grandson, never to early to introduce beauty and art and music.

0785132619|5.0|Great book, and not the exact same as the movie.  The book is more brutal in some ways, and has a very different story line surrounding Hit-Girl and Big Daddy's origins.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Enjoyed following Don and his social ineptness a well written novel that reminds us that not all of us are created alike
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I liked it at first. As a step counter and coloric calculator it was great. But the sleep tracking arm band you put this device in keeps falling off as I'm tossing and turning I wake up constantly putting the Velcro band back on. How is this suppose to track my sleep accurately when it can barely stay on. Second as I was saying in the beginning I at first liked the step counter and all up until the plastic sleeve you put the pulse in failed and dropped my pulse. Now I have no idea where it is I walked around the whole day with just the sleeve on my belt
B00CWY76CC|5.0|loved this game, even without hints it was a great brain work out. hope more levels come soon. will love to try more.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I started this game thinking I would just be looking for objects. But you have to make friends and collect quest items. And defeat monsters. And defeat bosses to gain entry into special rooms. You can make actual cash purchases if you want. Which speeds up the game. Or make a lot of friends and do a lot of trading. Which helps but is still slow. But the game is fun. And very addictive. One problem is updating the game. A lot of the players have lost their games and the company had to restore their games. Or it is hard to update it on the kindle.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's the best I love it but it could use work it kind of sucks uh uh uh uhh h uh

1492391719|5.0|Family dynamics are often complex and disagreeable. In THE BLACK EAGLE INN, the Inn and adjacent farm are as much characters in the story as the various members of the Hinterberger family and those who interact with them throughout the book.<br />This is imaginatively achieved by the nice blend of characters that stagnate refusing to grow in spite of life offering them great opportunities to do so as well as characters that grow, either by experience or example. The subtleties and blunt ways of attacking each other as members of a dysfunctional family are clever and easy to visualize.<br />The wide diversity infused in the small town setting through the historical periods is ingeniously woven by allowing some characters to grow through experiences in other cities or countries as well as by the international influence of the `foreign' elements, through visitors to the BLACK EAGLE INN or the flow of immigration through the various changes in Europe before during and after WWII, and well into the Cold War.<br />As the book covers a large time period it addresses historical attitudes to prejudice of all kinds, from the Jews, to women's rights as well as prejudice to Muslims with its strongest note to homophobia.<br />My favorite character was Markus; as a reader he took me in a journey of understanding success and failure. The possibility of redemption when feelings run deep and there is the presence of love and forgiveness. I also found the development of the character's journey trying to accept his truth, while battling the religious beliefs that made his very nature a sin a very believable one. It was very interesting to have a story that combined how society sees homosexuality through various time periods as well as how Markus learns to balance and accept who he is.<br />Emotions; positive and negative run deep at THE BLACK EAGLE INN. Rivalries make sense and the Karmic wallop to those who deeply deserve it made for a most enjoyable ending. I am a big Fan of Christoph Fischer and now that he has so nicely wrapped his Three Nation Trilogy and entered the realms of modern times, I am most curious as to what he will write next. BRAVO and well done!ph Fischer and now that he has so nicely wrapped his Three Nation Trilogy and entered the realms of modern times, I am most curious as to what he will write next.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Suspensville! Very creepy but sad story that you keep reading to find how who really killed most of the Day family. It's the kind of story that can make you see how a series of unfortunate events could possibly lead to murder.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|As usual, Drake is amazing. Although I do feel that this is a little be more mellow than I expected, given the songs he has been featured on recently, I really enjoy listening to it, and find something I like more about it each time I listen.  My favorite songs are the  singles released on the radio though.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Came in great quality, no tears or rips. Can not stop singing the wonderfully creative songs! Will order more for other surprise gifts!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Amazon needs to add an actual working printer app for the Kindle Fire HD that's FREE/built in. I have a wireless printer and I'd like to be able to print from my Kindle Fire HD. Basic apps should be included such as; Printer App, Calculator, Calendar, Alarm Clock...just to name a few. It sucks having to search through unknown/unsafe apps...we're risking a lot when we download apps.

Percy Jackson does all kinds of crazy things such as:<br />-jumping from the st. Louis arch<br />-killing Medusa<br />-fighting a god<br />All of the above are examples of Rick Riordian's creativity. You MUST read this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app.  Easy to use and understand.  Does a lot more than I need but if I need it, it's good to know that it's there.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had seen bits and pieces of the show over the years channel surfing and it always caught my interest, but because I hadn't seen it from the beginning I never let myself really get into it. Because I like to watch stuff on my kindle and I am a Prime member I looked it up and was thrilled to find it as one of the shows I could access, so I started from the beginning. I'm part way through Season 1 now and I love it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was a very good read I didn't want to put the book down once i started. Very  interesting  characters that I'm going to miss now that I'm through reading the book....Thanks so much Stephen King for another fantastic book...Love it..

B004EPZ084|4.0|I enjoy dark satire; and the full-circle irony of the plot reminds me of Office Space or Very Bad Things (which are two of my favorites).  The unsuspecting good guys (each successful, yet horribly unknowing) end up winning in the end; so it's sweet justice.  My wife & I openly laughed watching it, so it was pretty stinking funny; yet did not get the fully five stars- would have given it 4.5, had I had the option to do so...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does what it is supposed to. Does it well.  No complaints at all.  We hat err lee can I say?
B0089LOG02|4.0|Another bit of history we are not taught in schools.  Another piece explaining our history of child abuse that continues to this day no matter how hard many people try to inform, protect and change our direction - the bottom line being abuse of power.  Very well written.  Definitely not escape reading.
1476727651|4.0|What if there was a minuscule number of people in this world who could read the thoughts and feel the emotions of those around them? They could even communicate telepathically if they were lucky enough to find each other.<br /><br />Interesting idea, but like toast without butter, boring on its own.<br /><br />Now, what if there was an ancient order of not-quite-humans whose only way to stay alive was to slowly torture these so-called shiners and feed off the steam that's released?<br /><br />Basic ingredients for a pretty good story, that's what if.<br /><br />Though King put in enough background information to enjoy Doctor Sleep on its own, I imagine it'll read better if you pair it up with The Shining.<br /><br />The first few chapters introduce us to the main players and also run quickly through Dan Torrance's life after the Overlook Hotel, the horror-filled setting of his youth, burned to the ground. We learn that the ghosts never truly left and we watch him hit rock bottom, following in his father's drunken footsteps.<br /><br />Dan ends up meeting some good people who want to help him. He enrolls in AA, determined to start over. He forms a new relationship with Abra, a powerful young shiner who needs Dan's guidance and protection. Every day is a struggle though and with the unfolding battle, the temptation to quiet his &#34;gift&#34; with a twelve-pack only grows.<br /><br />I love how important pieces of The Shining came back full circle. I was worried that King would give into the temptation of wanting something fresh, ignoring the wealth of prior material, but my fears were unwarranted. Doctor Sleep is not only filled with nostalgic detail, but also captures the spirit of the original book.<br /><br />My one letdown was not much of surprise. I felt the climactic battle wrapped up too quickly. Without trying to spoil too much, Rose, the main antagonist, had been built up to be so strong, but in the end, her powers didn't seem to be a match for those of Dan and Abra. This only perpetuated a long history of Stephen King endings that just didn't do it for me. But, it's all about the journey, as they say. If there's one thing that keeps bringing me back to his books, it's the verisimilitude that he injects into his characters.<br /><br />If you're interested in this book, and you haven't read The Shining yet, I recommend you start there. But if you don't have the inclination, you'll probably still enjoy Doctor Sleep.and Abra. This only perpetuated a long history of Stephen King endings that just didn't do it for me.

B008Y6WMEY|5.0|If you have never seen this film do it now. Don't waste time reading this any further. Now, I tell you, start the movie. If you are driven to do it then read the rest of this review. I am not that interesting a writer so just watch the movie and save the effort of reading this..<br /><br />Is is a dark comedy reacting to the cold war of the 1960's. Given our current world it is still relevant.<br /><br />The overall story revolves around a doomsday nuclear scenario between the U.S. and the then Soviet Union.<br /><br />In any case Petere Sellers perfomance as multiple characters in the film was masterful. The other actors were also terrific including Sterling Hayden as the crazed Colonel Jack D. Ripper and George C. Scott. It was acclaimed when it was released and is considered as one of the best ever made. See [...] for a quick rundown.<br /><br />.

B001NLL93W|5.0|Excellent the whole way through! Cassandra Clare writes so descriptively that it is difficult not to feel as though you are right there inside the story... It's a must-read, just make sure to start with book one. The entire Mortal Instruments series of five books has been amazing!! :-)

B006H5120E|1.0|Disappointed. Wasted my money. The 3d version starts in the middle of the movie. No matter the tricks I did to restart the DVD, back it to the first scene, disconnect power from the wall, checked to see if it was the DVD player or the movie. It just simply started in the center of the movie. I was embarrassed with my guests. Ended up playing a second class movie for the night. Amazon, please send another one or credit my account. All other movies I have bought play in the DVD 3d. It is a new LG DVD player. It is the titanic disc that is defective.<br />First time I am disappointed at a purchase from AMAZON. This is an exception.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was surprised at how much it stayed on my mind afterward. It's not a great film -- a couple of the plot elements don't work or aren't developed, and I found Dev Patel's character as annoying as he was endearing. But it's a very good movie nonetheless. It left me smiling. Perhaps it was my weakness for grand old hotels, even when they're in a state of shabbiness, and for out-of-the-way places; the movie captures India in all its chaos and color. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel follows a group of aging Brits as they try a low-budget retirement in a run-down Indian hotel. The acting is first rate. I'm used to seeing Judi Dench playing formidable characters, perhaps because of her role in the latest James Bond flicks. Here, it's a pleasure to see her on a very human scale as a recent widow, struggling to build a new life, relying on her basic optimism and humanity to see her through. Bill Nighy I associate with somewhat satanic characters. Here he's great as a bumbling, funny, good-hearted ex-civil servant adjusting as best he can to a modest retirement. Tom Wilkinson is wonderful as a high-ranking judge who returns to India to find a lost love and perhaps make amends for the past. But it is the great Maggie Smith who stealthily takes over as movie goes on. This is fine, feel-good entertainment for grown-ups.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app works GREAT on Kindle Version 1! I wanted to buy a \\"WiFi Signal Meter\\". Most just give you a signal strength with 3 LED's. That's not good enough.

It shows you the actual signal strength and you can see the nearby signals too.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved this book.  I have recommended it to so many people already.  This is how we are a meant to live.
B00BATKPBE|4.0|A little too much re: youth non science activities.<br />Latter part of book is more specific to his ultimate achievements.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Loved his first two books - but this one just did not hold a candle to the first two.  Too many people from too many places and times - I found it very confusing and did not enjoy it at all.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, not because it is short, but because I couldn't tear myself away from it.  Lovely, nuanced language I expect from Neil Gaiman. Gods inserted into our everyday affairs, a mystical world where the veils between realities wear thin, layers of meaning, yes, all are there. But in this lovely meditation, there is more. The sensibility of age coupled with the naivete of youth.  The disappointments of the man clarified by the experiences of the child.  I was taken by the voice of the seven year old protagonist who is befriended by a young girl who ultimately saves him from the evil threatening his world, and also by the tired voice of the adult who is still trying to make sense of what happened all those years ago.  I particularly appreciated how the author seamlessly handled the integration of the \\"time\\" of the immortals with the \\"time\\" of the humans.  For a peek into the world behind our world that many try to explore, but none so beautifully as Gaiman, I highly recommend the Ocean at the End of the Lane.  You won't be sorry.

B0070UFMOW|5.0|This review is directed towards those who are entering the world of high quality sound. I'm not extremely experienced, and have only used a limited range of equipment, so I'm not going to pretend like I can review this product in its full justice. For perspective, my setup goes like this: 16bit FLAC &#62; Fidelia on my MacBook Pro &#62; digital out (using Micca optical cable, not USB) &#62; E17 &#62; Beyerdynamic DT 880.<br /><br />No doubt you've researched headphones and headphone amplifiers for many hours, browsing endlessly through the Head-Fi forums as I did. If you're confused, let me devote some space to describing why you might need a DAC/headphone amplifier.<br /><br />Our music is stored in 0s and 1s, or digital. But when we hear it, the 0s and 1s have been converted into an electrical signal by a DAC, then into air pressure by speakers (headphones included). **High quality sound might be described as perfection of those conversions!** Most computer DACs aren't the most accurate, and you're losing some authenticity of the original recording. Most computer amplifiers aren't strong enough to power your speakers' (again, headphones included) needs; thus, they can't accurately bring to life the recording. But no matter what sort of signal you feed to cheap speakers, they can't accurately recreate a recording anyway.<br /><br />So if you want to hear music as it was meant to be, you've got to invest in some nice transducers - or converters - including a DAC, an amplifier, and a pair of speakers (headphones). And in most users' cases, the E17 perfectly satisfies those first two needs. Unless you're going for some crazy high-end headphones (in which case you probably won't ever read this review or visit Amazon, since you should already know most everything about high-end audio to justify that investment), look no further for a DAC/headphone amp. On the other hand, don't go for this amp if you're getting some 'fashion-accessory' headphones like Skullcandy or Beats; it really won't do anything. And please, buy it refurbished, used, or best, open-box. It'll save you money and perform just as well as a new one would.<br /><br />As for headphones... remember that there's no magical solution. Since I've only listened to the DT 880s, I'm not going to make any recommendations. But be wary of people who DO make recommendations without any experience or empirical knowledge! I wish you good luck on your search for the personally perfect audio system.; it really won't do anything. And please, buy it refurbished, used, or best, open-box. It'll save you money and perform just as well as a new one would.<br /><br />As for headphones... remember that there's no magical solution.

B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Works well with AVI files and easy to use. I tried VLC app but it didn't work, this is the solution.
B008EKON56|3.0|I was going to buy an L3 or L9, but then I saw this new L11. I thought it'd be great; I can charge my iPod and get an audio line-out. However, it turns out that the charging function doesn't work (at least for my iPod Touch 3), and the L11 is fatter than the L3 and L9. This means that it won't fit with a case, even if it's slim.<br /><br />Like I said, just buy the L9 or L3.
1401917232|5.0|Gary Renard did a great job of his final trillogy.  It was easy to read and of course follows the Course.  It also gives some health tips which I found very helpful immediately.  It was well worth the wait.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I had heard of this for years.  Glad to have got to read it.  The old man Joseph was hard to understand was my only problem.  You just had to guess about the ending and figure he gave up on getting the girl.  I would recommend it to any one who loves to read.
B009NG1Q96|2.0|Ok... I read The Selection and thought it was ok so I decided to give Elite a whirl. Worst decision! The Elite was like The Selection only this time there only 6 girls left and one of those girls happens to be America. To say that America is a dumb witted girl would be understand. The girl absolutely has no class or any respect for herself. Here she is leading a double life but gets absolutely bat stuff crazy when Maxon does as well.... HELLO???? Did you honestly think you had him so wrapped and so secure that you had nothing to worry about??<br /><br />&#34;Maybe their using the books for kindling&#34;... &#34;Yeah maybe&#34;... America and Aspen are a match made in heaven. The rebels are attacking the palace and stealing books and these two nincompoops believe it's for kindling... What a match made in heaven. I was wishing more that ever in this book for America and Aspen to get caught too.<br /><br /> I'm so tired of the two love interests  and how America strings them along like puppets; however, I am happy that America will get a taste of her own medicine in the next book. And maybe the last book CAN EXPLAIN TO US THE FREQUENT AND DISTURBING REBEL ATTACKS!!! As a reader I pieced together what they could want but why do they need those?
B008Y6RYDS|3.0|Had to watch this again to remind myself about this iconic movie. Great actors acting pretty poorly. It's hard to tell if they were just getting started with their big screen careers or if they were handed a terrible script.
B00CRGZMUI|2.0|Having read the previous 2, I was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately it just didn't feel realistic coming out of the diary of a 50 year old woman. You can read it for a fun afternoon but don't have high expectations.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read the next book. Wonderful characters and a unique story.
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|Ancillary Justice was . . . unique. Hard sci-fi. Brilliant. If, like me, you mourn the loss of Banks, then perhaps Leckie can help us endure the long night.
B0053O89WY|4.0|I love this show, and not having a tv while in college is probably a good thing. The discs came right on time and nothing was wrong with them. Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very intuitive game play, best solitaire game out there. Lots of customization options for card backs, can use own photos.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|The discs came very quickly and nothing was wrong with them. Love this show! Will not have a life for a while... gotta catch up!
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|I enjoyed watching this move. Its a very good old classic. No special effects just great acting and easy to follow story line. Check it out.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. Lots of cool stuff to try.  I enjoy trying new things on this app.  Very cool
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this book so much it is so epic that I read it at least two or three times. good penmanship.
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|Alison Brown<br /><br />Al last a realistic view of motherhood and the dating game for the over 50s. Which if you've never tried it, is much the same as in your twenties. Do any of us really grow up?

B000MR9D5E|5.0|I use it to teach. It's a great series and the kids are completely mesmerized watching it. I just love it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a very fun game!<br />Interactive and challenging but best of all free.<br />My daughter likes to play too.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|A truly entertaining movie that every member of your family will enjoy. The animation is simply breathtaking. The humor hits every level.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As the die hard Stephen King fan, I say this book is a tremendous follow up story on the life of Danny Torrance. Very great characters, interesting story and plot. I could see this storyline turning into something bigger like the gunslinger series. Wish there were more. As always.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a very addictive game so I recommend that you get this game there are over 300 levels
0375836675|5.0|This book is kind of &#34;pay it forward&#34;-ish but very, very different and keeps you guessing right through to the end. Very cleverly put together and really delightful. It's probably for &#34;Young Adults&#34; but, although far from being a young adult, I found this, and other books directed toward that group of readers, delightful and wonderfully refreshing.<br />Yes, I would definitely recommend buying this book
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I love this movie and the cast is fantastic. I am really hoping they make an Italian Job 2. Highly recommend it.
B00C90T4QK|3.0|After playing this album over and over because I am going to see him in concert next month,it feels like this album is made from songs from his former albums that didn't make the cut. Maybe because he just got married and is having a baby that he just didn't have the time to really be the Buble man we all know and love to hear. But knowing that Michael Buble is a dedicated artist, this album does not seem to be up to his past music and this is why I think these are the lesser cuts from the past. There are some songs I really like on this album a few I love and some I skip over.. usually I listen to every single song on his album ar none.. also, I am tired of his original songs.. they are getting too cutesy pop sounding and cookie cutter
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My life is complete.  Finally.. Candy Crush is on the Kindle Fire!  Thank you Thank you Thank you!!!!!!!!!  The game is the same ....  still awesome.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book with an open mind after hearing about it at a dental course.  Dr William Davis certainly did extensive research and cited patients whose lives had changed because of the mutation of wheat.  It got me motivated to lose the wheat, and am having exceptional results.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone I know.  Wow
B0068FYZZW|1.0|The one currently up on amazon for $13.99 doesn't come with the flip open slipcover. I found this out the hard way.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great timer app. It is very configurable and easily meets my needs. Also, it works flawlessly on my HTC One running Android Revolution HD 22.
B000GOWNPU|1.0|Horrible, gratuitous and sleepy indeed. Getting through the opening credits was bad but the movie is worse.<br />At one point with the director obviously lacking an idea of what to do there is a 45 second shot of Robert DeNiro looking at the camera because who doesn't like seeing RD right?<br />The soundtrack is equally as poorly chosen and used. The story could have been something but this movie is trying too hard to be epic and it just isn't.
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I was never exposed to any latin music, but when I began working with a Colombian physician he introduced me to the extraordinary Carlos Vives and gave me an incredible history lesson on Colombian music.  I began digging into his music from years ago up until this present album and I am hooked.  Joyful, down to earth, beautiful videos, beautiful lyrics ( I have to translate since I don't speak Spanish!)  Infectious and incredible!!  I love Carlos Vives!!!
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|After earth was an interesting and well done movie. This is a great addition to my Sci fi film collection. The acting was very good and the movie kept my attention until the end. Well done Smith men and M. Night! I am not sure what the critics saw but I will watch this movie again and again.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Start studded movie with lots of funny scenes and special effects. Some of the scenes were a little too predictable for my taste, hence the dropped star.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|Lightning Bolt Review<br /><br />Pearl Jam's tenth album Lightning Bolt has arrived and after spending a week listening to it closely I have decided to write a review. Lightning Bolt contains some decent songs from the group but nothing that will probably stack up to classic material found prior to the 21st Century. There are times when it is better than their last effort Backspacer and times when it is not. The album features some decent rock tracks, but listeners may be surprised by the level of slow downbeat songs found on the album. The albums strength are found through the middle portion but it dies down at the end.<br /><br />Lightning Bolt gets off to a fast start with perhaps the two most rocking tracks on the album. \\"Getaway\\" is a track that starts of the album in similar fashion as \\"Go\\" and \\"Last Exit\\" did for Vs. and Vitalogy respectively. Although the song is rather a decent opener, it lacks the lyrical strength of those aforementioned songs, but it is still better than the opening of Backspacer. The second punch by the band is \\"Mind Your Manners\\" which didn't exactly blow me away the first time I listened to it. But the more I listen to it the more I like it. It has great lyrics and is a great combination of punk and hard rock. The album really hits its first dud on track 3, \\"My Fathers Son\\", which seemed to be an angry rocker but seemed to lack lyrics and nothing really stood out instrumentally that could have compensated for its numerous weaknesses.<br /><br />The albums strongest section is found in tracks 4-8, which feature a decent power ballad and numerous downbeat numbers. With \\"Sirens\\" the album shifts tone dramatically from fast paced angry songs to more downbeat reflective songs that one would expect from a bunch of guys that have seen many years as a band. \\"Sirens\\", like mind your manners, didn't necessarily stop me in my tracks when I first heard it. The song features ok lyrics but the best part of the song is its production as well as the guitar work that is featured which can match some of the best Pearl Jam material out there. It is a power ballad, which I am sure many Pearl Jam purist will slam, but as rolling stone magazine pointed out, it avoids the cheesy factor that many other rock bands fall into when attempting. \\"Lightning Bolt\\" picks back up the pace and it is one of the strongest songs on the album. All the elements of a great rock song are found A good hook, catchy lyrics, clutch guitar playing. \\"Infallible\\" is a decent track that comes close to resembling \\"Tremor Christ\\" from the Vitalogy days. \\"Pendulum\\" is an interesting track that got my attention but in the in end it felt like it lacked just a little something that could have pushed it from being a really good song to a great song. Perhaps the best structured song on the album lyrically and musically besides \\"Lightning Bolt\\" would be \\"Swallowed Whole\\" which features some of the best lyrics and singing found on the album and guitar work that truly kicks some serious butt.<br /><br />The album mostly burns out after \\"Swallowed Whole\\" but does contain \\"Yellow Moon\\" which saves the latter part of the album from being a total disappointment. \\"Let the Records Play\\" and \\"Sleeping by Myself\\" aren't necessarily awful tracks but they left myself yawning and looking at the sleeve wondering if the album was almost over. \\"Yellow Moon\\" helps revive a little bit of the attention lost due to lack luster nature of the previous two tracks which is mostly thanks to the guitar work provided. The album ends with the piano heavy \\"Future Days\\" which is better than many other closing tracks from recent Pearl Jam albums but falls well short of album closers such as \\"Release\\", \\"Indifference\\", \\"Immortality\\" (I don't consider Hey Foxymop as the Vitalogy closer musically. The album probably could have benefited from cutting the closing track and moving \\"Pendulum\\" into that spot.<br /><br />Overall, a rating anywhere between a 6-7/10 should be appropriate for thisalbum. It really lacks any tracks that could be called classics but still contains some great songs worth repeated listens for longtime fans. They probably could have cut one or two of the duds out and it would have made for a more solid album.<br /><br />Highlights: Mind Your Manners, Sirens, Lightning Bolt, Pendulum, Swallowed Whole,<br />Ok Tracks: Getaway, Infallible, Yellow Moon, Future Days.<br />Meh: My Father's Son, Let the Records Play, Sleeping By Myself,
B000FC2ROU|5.0|There are so many good thought provoking lines in this book. I recommend reading it. I especially love the  dynamic between the old man and his traveling companion.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even though most of us cannot relate to the opulence of this piece we can relate to the interaction of the people involved.  Having wealth does not insulate you from human problems.  We are all of us, wealthy or not subject to the same human emotions, anger, fear, jealousy...This series has a blend of all and very well done.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had much fun blowing thru all the levels, gaining more confidence as each level progressed. Tho I was never very adept at math/algebra- when a math problem is required to solve to acquire another clue, I've come to realize that the most basic figuring of the equation is the most probable to figure out. Wish there were more levels to play with. I am amazed at the details in the hi-def display on my kindle hd. Can't wait for more and as complex as this game may seem, even a Bushman from the Kalahari could figure it out and enjoy it as immensely as I have.Kudos to all!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I just love the animation and the characters in this movie.  It can be silly, but that's what I find uplifting.  Sometimes silly is just what you need to feel good.  The everyday grind can be a bit too much and this movie takes you out of it all.
B0016K40KY|5.0|Academy Award nominations: Leading Actor-Peter O'Toole, Supporting Actor-Omar Sharif and Screenwriting Based on another Medium  Wins: Picture, Director-David Lean, Cinematography, Set Design, Original Score-Maurice Jarre, Film Editing and Sound Mixing    March Boy Award nominations: Supporting Actor-Anthony Quinn, Supporting Actor-Alec Guinness.    Wins: Picture, Director-David Lean, Leading Actor-Peter O'Toole, Supporting Actor-Omar Sharif, Cinematography, Set Design, Costume Design, Make up, Original Score-Maurice Jarre and Sound Mixing.    I am a film critic who has changed his mind. Two years ago I saw Lawrence of Arabia and was not very impressed. To me it seemed dull, stale and boring. Now that I'm older and have studied film making a little more carefully, I can truly say that this is unquestionably one of the greatest historical epic films ever made. The dialogue is intelligent and beautiful to hear, the direction flawless, the acting superb on all levels and the production values first-class. The only Academy Award quibble I have is the film editing; some scenes go on a little too long like the camels' entries and exoduses from the camps. I could probably cut out twenty minutes and not do the movie any harm. But even that isn't a bad choice.    I wish Peter O'Toole had won the 1962 Best Leading Actor Award for Lawrence instead of Gregory Peck for Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird because he got to play a more complex role. Atticus Finch is a saintly, upright, model father and lawyer and the movie does a good job balancing the two halves of his life--home and work. He knows in his heart he's not going to win the case because he's defending a black man in court against a jury steeped in racism but he still stands up for what he sincerely believes is the truth. However I think Atticus is a little too good. The world would certainly be a better place if there were more fathers like him but they don't always make the most fascinating characters in books ormovies. The most entertaining heroes are the ones that have shades of gray and black--a naughty side as well as a good side--to show that they are `real' people with strengths and weaknesses. Lawrence is an English soldier prone to ego and eccentricities but if you look beyond his odd exterior you'll see that he really does care about his friends and comrades. After helping the Arabs conquer Aqaba and blow up the Turkish railways he lets his pride get out of control and begins to believe he is the Arabs `divinely appointed leader.' He walks boldly into a Turkish headquarter thinking they will all fall down in awe and amazement at his presence. Luckily he escapes with his life but not without having been taken down a peg or two in the prison. He returns to his Arab comrades, a humbled person, and helps them finish the war. Peter O'Toole gives a magnificent, four-dimensional performance. He brings out Lawrence's strengths and weaknesses and glides smoothly back and forth from subtle to melodramatic.    The rest of the cast offer strong support. Omar Sharif gives a refined, smooth, subtle, polished performance as Sherif Ali, the Arab Lawrence is closest too. Their personalities and opinions often clash but they gradually conceive a respect for each other despite not always seeing eye to eye. Anthony Quinn's rough, charismatic, forceful performance as General Auda Tabi is a perfect 180 degree opposite to the low-key Ali, Jose Ferrer was absolutely perfect as the sadistic Turkish captain--I always feel like killing him when he interrogates Lawrence--Anthony Quayle is a good-natured English colonel who makes friends with Lawrence out of pity when he sees that he's being used back and forth by the Arab and English politicians and Alec Guinness is regal, eloquent and dignified just as a king would be.    Maurice Jarre's music is a magnificent blend of Middle Eastern and European elements to portray the clash of Arab and English culture. The cinematography and set design isabsolutely gorgeous and richly deserved their Oscars.    Five Stars.

B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie is top notched and should be seen by all Americans.  It does a great job of putting you right in the overly complex times of the civil war and the real issues facing the North and South.  It clearly depicts the many decisions that could have easily led to the fall of our democracy.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I usually have several books open at a time.  I didn't put this one down until it was done.  Thanks, Mr King.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am having  lot of fun - as you go up in numbers it gets more challenging.  I would recommend this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was somewhat apprehensive about this novel.  As Mr. King states himself, there is no way to recreate the feeling a reader has from a first scare, and The Shining was that first for me.  However, this novel was a homecoming.  Seeing Dan's childhood torment  through adult explanation  made parts  of what I already knew even scarier and more haunting.  The knowledge was also enlightening and I cheered for Dan from beginning  to end.  Thank you Mr. King for exploring  Dan's life after Overlook and for always delivering a story that is impossible to put down.  You are a true Master of Suspense.

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Lots of big name stars, good special effects and production values but the story is quite contrived, makes no sense and the surprise ending leaves you scratching your head - a lot of effort for a silly conclusion. There have to be a lot of easier ways for someone to get revenge. Good mindless entertainment.
B002RRWWQ4|5.0|Great movie! A little more violent at times but good. Now I need to go back and read all the books.
B00DW1WR14|3.0|The first half of the CD sounds like typical PJ.  Not that that's bad.  But, nothing groundbreakingly new either.  The second half of the CD is kind of all over the place and would sound more at home on a Vedder solo effort.  Again, not a bad thing. But, nothing new.  It's ok.  I'll listen to it for a few months.  In a few years, it won't be the first thing I pull out of the PJ catalog.
B00CATSONE|2.0|As others have stated this is more self-help than about Tesla. Reading Empires of Light and enjoying it much more.

B005K17RU0|2.0|Since this is brand-name among Internet forecasts, I ordered it.  Much preferred WeatherBug's features and ease of use.  I deleted Accuweather after a short test drive.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love it!  Wish I had more than 5 lives, without paying, as well as more charms to help, helps pass time..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The story was filled with extremely well written characters and absolutely terrifying villains. Although I do not possess any of the &#34;shining&#34; myself, I found myself looking over my shoulder a few times while walking my dog at night. My view of Winnebagos and RVs have also taken on a slightly sinister and tainted light in my eyes. I am sure I will be revisiting this novel again sometime down the road just like I revisit my favorite Stephen King novel &#34;It&#34; every year. For those of you who haven't read &#34;The Shining&#34; I would recommend reading (or rereading if you've read it awhile ago) before reading &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;. It will help make some connections during the story which you might not understand if you've never read &#34;The Shining&#34; or are going by the movie story alone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is an amazing book written in a clear style specific to Orson Scott Card. This book is one of SF most famous book. I strongly recommend it to everyone loving SF books. This was the second time I read it (first time was 10 years ago) and I enjoyed every moment.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Series speaks for itself. If you liked the first then you'll like this one. So go read it already and stop reading reviews.
B00EF1PKJQ|3.0|This one is just OK.  I appreciate artists trying to push their boundaries, but sometimes it takes them in directions that just are not as fun for the listener.  I love a good jam grass band, I love listening to Grisman play jazz with bluegrass instruments, I like bluegrassy remakes of cover tunes, I even like a good traditional bluegrass band.  This effort tries to do a little of all of this, but falls flat for me.

B0060CV31C|5.0|Hilarious! Great for kids & adults. David Spade does the main voice and he's so funny. I've loved this movie since it came out the first time.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a quick, easy, page turner of a book despite some of the far fetched plot concepts. Perfect for a vacation read!
0399226907|5.0|I love the gift - and it was a fair price and was appreciated by the person who received the gift.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|It was a narrative that could have been done in less pages.  I became bored.  However,<br />I enjoyed the commentary with the writer at the end of the book.  It actually gave me<br />more insight to what she was trying to convey in her book.
0399229191|5.0|I love the gift - and it was a fair price and was appreciated by the person who received the gift.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Clever book with fantastic twists and turns that had me reading it in one sessions as I couldn't out it down. Will very much look forward to more books from this fantastic author.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I know it's beta extension.. but still... Can't wait till it gonna work.. And google release the SDK for delvp....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting a very LONG time for this game to be on the Kindle!! Thanks to whom ever FINALLY decided to add this app!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this movie delivered as promised on great acting, plot, characters, dialog, etc. If you want extreme drama than choose a drama, same with comedy and other genres. This movie is a great sci-fi action movie with great effects as well. I am glad to see new stars and not the same faces that we usually see till you get tired of them. It didn't bog down in any one area which can happen with some films and didn't overplay any angst that some characters might have till you wanted to smack them and tell them to get over it. You got a good feel for the personalities of the many characters in the movie. I recommend this if you want a good movie night with friends or family!
0385350864|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this edition of Bridget's diary.  I was wondering how it would all turn out, given how Mark had passed from their lives.  It was a bit sad, but still uplifting- amusing- especially as she worked out things in her mind and made wrong choices, and acted all hoity toity around the new hot Daniel Craigish teacher.<br /><br />Had a proper wrap up at the end- can't see how any more squeals can be squeezed out after this one.<br /><br />Glad I read it and I highly recommend it to anyone who loved the 1st two books.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|I didn't think I would like it but it kept my attention.  My husband picked it and typically I don't pay attention to his picks but this one was really good.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|it makes. you challenge. yourself. its really a nice attractive game for all age groups. good job. keep it up
140006922X|4.0|It gives a different perspective once the historical and social background is laid open. It is very well written. He clearly does not like the person of the Apostle Paul. In my personal faith relationship, it did not raise any doubts.
0142419400|4.0|Really great book, every girl should read it! But I just have to say it! What about Meredith!? She is a smart, kind, talented,athletic girl and she still can't get a guy! Since Anna is the protagonist we are suppose to be rooting for her, but I honestly can't help but feel bad for Meredith. She loves St. Clair and the novel ends with her having to accept that he doesn't like her and he loves her best friend. How tragic! Even worse is that Meredith is called &#34;big&#34; in the athletic way and referred to as a dyke by the story's villain as if to say that strong athletic girls can't get the guys and that as a woman if you are strong you are gay?! what the heck! I just wanna say Meredith, I feel for you girl! There should be a version of fanfic that is her side of the story.It would be more realistic because that is what most girl's feel. They like guys that don't like them back and have to deal with it. I could relate.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This was my first time reading this book and I absolutely loved it. Everyone should read this book. This book is not only a classic but also a must read  for forward thinking women everywhere. Charlotte Bronte was a voice for intelligent, independent women everywhere before it was popular to adopt this role.
B001XUH69Y|4.0|This is a must see movie, A classic to be sure. The quality was great. I sometimes wish they had colorized it though. But it keeps to the original integrity of the movie for it time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is dangerous because it's so addictive. I love all the pretty  colors. A good way to waste time while waiting for appointments or just to take a break. So glad Amazon finally got it in the app store.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|LOVE the characters, town and writing.  Look forward to the next book, and the rest of this interesting set of  people
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Love  mathew ion this film a great character part  reminded me of the classic film Stand By Me  The child actors were great

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|candy crush is one of the best games out there.. really love it; so entertaining. just hats when I run out of lives; because I never want to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome. It's very addicting. I love the meena battles in  the new Halloween theme in the residential area<br /><br />Overall great game
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|I found Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn to be really entertaining. I thought it was going to be cheesy but it was really entertaining. Even if your not a Halo fan or do not know anything about Halo, you could still enjoy this. This movie has me anxious to see the upcoming movies of Halo.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this version. Very user friendly. I wish I could download it on my Note. Much easier to use than the other free Bible apps.
0307476073|5.0|Another great book, inspiring for women. I would recommend it for all. Don't think I could do what she did, but good luck to anyone who tries it.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Fast paced, exciting, great entertainment.  Will definitely download the next one down the list for my next eBook.  Strongly recommend it.
B00F8LPH90|2.0|This game was really fun for the first day...<br />Tried to engage the next day and the game crashes. Tried reset, no luck. Wish I could get my coins back:(
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Awesome game. The challenges build up as you play and get harder and harder. No ingame purchasing which is nice!!!!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was excellent!!!  It was a very easy read.  I couldn't put it down and read it in two days.  You will easily fall in love with Enzo,  and feel his frustrations.  I would, and have,<br />highly recommend this book to animal lovers  everywhere
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Very entertaining!! Made me want to keep watching from the first episode! I can't wait to keep watching. Love it!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. Unique story line- you can't help but get wrapped in this books characters. Beginning go end, The Hunger Games is flawless.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game a lot it is easy and it is fun I would die by a chansaw for it:
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I just watched \\"Beetlejuice\\" for the very first time last night. I saw it on sale at my local Walmart for $4 and I just couldn't resist it. It was a blind buy just because I have not seen it all the way through before. I had laughed so hard until I cried Micheal Keaton, Gena Davis, and Alec Baldwin stole the show. I Highly recommend it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in this film, as I always expect something exceptional from Woody Allen.  The character, Owen Wilson, is way below bland.  This rest of the film is flat, also.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I like playing it but had no idea hoe yo get started.  had to find directions nonlinear because the only directions. in the app. were to &quot;solve puzzles&quot;
B006MGDVIY|5.0|But this still isn't the version I saw in the theaters.  I saw a longer version, which looks like a UK release -- but somehow I saw it here in the States.  I will still try to find that longer version.  It was very impactful on his passion, drive, generosity, purity of desire, determination, persistence in adverse times.  A real tribute to his character.
0525958002|3.0|This isn't a bad book, by any stretch of the imagination, but it's also not a great revelation of insight, either - at least it's not if you're a hardcore fan that already knows John's story.  I had hoped for more insight on everything, but especially the later part of John's life, and all the critical situations and decisions that brought us to the man he is today.  Instead, the story John tells is more about the heyday of Duran's success, with a bit of his childhood and later life thrown in, and only occasionally gets deeper than just below the surface.  Overall, it was an enjoyable read, but it wasn't written for the audience most likely to read it.  The best autobiography of an 80's pop icon remains Boy George's &#34;Take It Like A Man&#34;.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Worth reading. Interesting to read about the effects of eating or not eating wheat. Started to try cut out wheat from my diet. Hope it helps reduce my belly.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very much enjoyed King's new novel with the nod to The Shining. Like most of the reviewers, I have read almost everything Stephen King has written. Some have been simply enjoyable, but some have been tremendous. I would put Doctor Sleep in a new category called a fun read. I enjoyed it to the hilt. While it is not The Stand, It (my fav), or The Shining it is a page turner and has characters you either want to root for or tear apart. If you are a King fan, read it and be entertained.
B000LTAY1U|3.0|I really love the looks of the watch and surprisingly I get quite a few compliments on it.  Usually the comments are &#34;How do you pull off a canvas/nylon wristband? I have always wanted one but they never look good on me.&#34; or &#34;That's a nice watch! I love the simplicity!&#34; I chose the green version of this watch as most of the clothes I wear are brown or neutral. I've found this watch goes just fine with all colors of the spectrum. I even wear it with my business formal attire. I like to think it keeps me grounded and lets my personality show underneath all the formality. Sort of like Booth from Bones with his Cocky belt buckle and crazy socks. :) Aside from its pleasing aesthetics and versatility, the mechanical operation and reliability leave a bit to be desired.<br /><br />I purchased this watch from Amazon on March 5, 2013.  It is now October 20th, 2013 and I am attempting to make a warranty claim/repair.  I've have worn this watch everyday and have had it submerged in water less than 2 feet on 2 occasions. Since I purchased the watch I have had to adjust the time every few days as it seems to lose time overnight which gradually results in the watch being off by 8-15 minutes.  In late September the watch started making more noise as the mechanical movement components became loose and moved against the glass case/cover on the underside of the watch.  While the watch still works, it needs daily adjustment to keep the time correct.<br /><br />Despite the mechanical issues, I still really like this watch. At the price point, one can hardly expect to have a perfect timepiece. If Seiko holds to their warranty then this watch is worthy of 3.5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is my favorite game..... I play every day all day!!!!!! I have it on my kindle, my phone and my laptop...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining has always been my second favorite Stephen King novel (The Stand being my favorite).  I thought Doctor Sleep was just as good!!  It was fascinating to see what had become of little Danny. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />Avid Reader
0062225790|3.0|Dawkins is a good writer of popular science books and indeed is a very interesting figure but it seems he's not very interesting writer of other books then popular science. Although biography, it is more written like a popular science book, meaning that Dick tends to more explain background of genealogy of human genome then his own family. For instance I heard that his grand-grand-grand fathers fought in American Independence wars but he missed to mention them in his ancestors chapter. Or he's more interested in writing about boarding schools systems then his time there. I mean there were some fascinating stories and facts about his schooling years, especially when he said how some boys were used as slaves, but let's face it all male schools are pretty boring and so far only Stephen Fry, in his autobiography, managed to make it fun to read.<br />Rest of the book, after school years, were a total snooze for me. It got all to technical with ancient computers to whom Dawkins dedicated good portion of his life.<br />So my honest opinion is that this will only interest die hard Dawkins fans while the rest will be pretty bored. And even the title \\"An appetite for wonder\\" is a bit misleading because even Dawkins himself admitted he was not all that keen to science, missing many opportunities to attend science classes, until he came to the point he had to choose his career. It's not like, for instance, Darwin who collected bugs in his childhood to the point that in the absence of a jar he put them in his mouth.<br /><br />And if he's gonna write a sequel, as he plans to do, then he needs to keep to the stories and anecdotes. Possibly even read \\"I Asimov\\" by Issac Asimov to see how even a scientist can write really funny and entertaining story about himself.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Very easy to download, set up and use.  The others that rated this app  left many helpful hints on usage in the rating section.  For me it is a  well used app and worth the small price.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game! keeps you wanting to get you the next level. best game to play. helps time go by when waiting for something
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really like this book because it is interesting.it is a surprise to me please send it to the other person then talk to me

B000YABIQ6|5.0|\\"Mad Men Season 1\\" caught my attention because of my fascination with the public relations world and the story being based on the career symbolism of advertising (which is indirectly related to public relations).  I unexpectedly learned the various ways that media and other various outlets can have subtle influence.  It was also important for me to watch the first season in order to help me further understand the other seasons of Mad Men that I intend to watch. The following are some of the various facets of the season 1 that piqued my interest and made the characters relatable and series worthwhile to watch:<br />The characters of Don Draper, Betty Draper, and Rachel Menken have all experienced what it feels like to lose their mothers to physical death. Additionally, the character of Don Draper had to secretly carry the societal stigma of his late biological mother being a prostitute. I also liked how Betty Draper was portrayed as a dynamic woman who adores both her children and husband but yearns for a life of her own outside the home. I feel that this portrayal is realistic due to my own personal experiences of observing my late adoptive mother until I was 18 years old. She dearly loved my siblings and me as well as my adoptive father. However, I frequently noticed that her face lit up more during the time periods in her life when she had to get ready for work.<br />Watching the characters of Joan Holloway giving career advice to Peggy Olson made gave the series a great touch because both women were carefully navigating their professional lives while dealing with workplace sexual harassment. The Progressive Car Insurance lady (Stephanie Courtney) and Darby Stanchfield (from the TV series Scandal) also make appearances during Mad Men season 1.<br />The following pop culture references are among those mentioned in Mad Mean season 1: Lady Chatterley, Sara Lee cake, Atlas Shrugged, Mad magazine, Rosetta Stone, and Clearasil.<br />Mad Men Season 1 is a fascinating series to watch for those who are either interested in American culture from the 1960's, enjoy watching drama series, and/or those curious about the world of advertising.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This is an amazing app!! I love it and now i get to record me and the great times i have with my family! I love this app and use it all the time :)
B0089AD8IO|5.0|I admit that I decided to watch Doctor Who (season 1) as one of the ways to bond with my husband and to further understand his inner world.  He is a Doctor Who fanatic and recommended that I watch the first season starring Christopher Eccleston (G.I Joe: The Rise of Cobra, upcoming Thor movie) and Billie Piper (Secret Diary Of A Call Girl tv series) in order to help me get the message of the subsequent seasons. The series opens with the character of Rose unintentionally meeting \\"The Doctor\\" after an eerie encounter involving mannequins.  Simon Pegg (The World's End), John Barrowman (Torchwood tv series) and Richard Wilson (Merlin tv series) are among some of the celebrities who guest star in season 1 of Doctor Who.  Simon Pegg  features in The Long Game episode (#7),  while Jack Barrowman and Richard Wilson first make appearances in \\"The Empty Child\\" episode (#9). Doctor Who (season 1) is great for those who are fine with watching science fiction television series involving time travel plots.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love this game. The graphics are fantastic. The friends list does not work for me however. It's quite addicting only wished all the aspects worked
B003ODIZL6|3.0|Well it is a little complicated. I would of given it a 3 and ¹/² but I couldn't figure it out. It is recommended to a person in college.
B007Z5LBE2|5.0|The minute I started the novel I could not put it down. I read it in about 9 hours on a plane. It is rare for me to enjoy a new novel so much, I tend to lean more towards the classics. This novel was amazing, realistic, and moving. I did not know how it could be translated to film. How they would capture the beauty and pain that is present within the novel.<br /><br />Yet, they some how managed to do it. Of course it moved away from the novel at points, making scenes that were not present, but simply alluded to. Despite this, it was a lovely adaptation. The acting was spot on and the depictions throughout were lovely. I would highly suggest this to anyone! If you are looking for a typical feel good film and want everything to be daisies this is not the film for you. If, on the other hand, you can enjoy the beauty in pain and still see the humanity in the piece then you will love this! I watched it for free, but will be purchasing it to be able to watch again and again.
0300169787|5.0|After having seen the exhibition in New York  I enjoy again and again the beautiful and breathtaking pieces of art done by Alexander McQueen.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very clean segue from The Shining to Doctor Sleep. Also allows for another sequel, to the sequel. One to look forward to reading.
B00881VLCE|2.0|The puzzles are great when you can get the app to open or load. After a week I decided to uninstall the app because it would crash my Fire more often than the app would open... just not worth the hassle.  Please fix the bugs as I really enjoyed the puzzles but could never complete even one without the app crashing.
B0002W10U0|5.0|This is a great movie about alien abduction if you believe in that sort of thing.  I believe the story and I believe that Travis Walton was abducted.  There is actually a 90 minute Paranormal Witness episode about this event.  Its equally as good as the movie with the real Travis and his friends and families.  A great great movie!
1441892168|5.0|This is by far the best version of Charles Dickens Christmas Carol I have heard.  This is very faithful to the narrative of the book.  The voice actors, narrator, and music are all outstanding.  If you like the Christmas Carol story, you will very much enjoy this Colonial Radio dramatization.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|I am 44 years of age and have been a KISS fan since 76', 77'.  Back in the day KISS was the &#34;hottest band in the land&#34; and I grew up on that chit.  I love vintage KISS.  This collection of footage from 1974 through 1977 is too sweet!  GREAT footage including rare interviews, live performances and videos.  You just gotta own this DVD set if you are a KISS fan.  Volume 2 is great as well.  Those are the only two that I own and have seen.
B005QYKD4I|1.0|It was was marketed for kids, but there was way too much sex, violence, and language.  It was a bad movie all around.
B000GOTESO|4.0|it was entertaining and funny, not a deep message or coment on societys problems. seven more words required.. what can you say about a stallone movie, but i enjoyed it
B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper The Friendly Ghost was a famous cartoon of the 1950's and 1960's.  A few decades later it became an excellent movie starring Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci.  Pullman plays a scientist who is interested in the paranormal since the death of his wife, and he is one kooky scientist!  Ricci, is his long suffering daughter who puts up with her dad's kookiness.  They move into a haunted house to investigate ghosts and encounter Casper, a ghost who was a boy about 80 years before.  The plot is great, the two \\"bad guys\\" are portrayed by Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle.  There are some guest appearances such as \\"Ghostbuster\\" Dan Akryod who runs out of the house afraid.  The plot is great as well as the scenery inside the house and good special effects.  This is a fun movie to watch with the family and has some quite touching scenes as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The book read like a true story, could hardly put it down.<br />The characters common denominator in their lives, so many years apart was amazing.
B003V99B16|5.0|Yo-Yo Ma + Ennio Morricone? Can't get any better than that! I listen to this all the time, just wish it was longer.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|I totally screwed up in 1989, we were in London, could have stayed over and seen both &#34;Cats&#34; and &#34;Phantom&#34;.  We had not even thought about ending our Tour by capping it off with those Fantastic shows.  This DVD will have to be a reminder of &#34;LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP&#34;  Really enjoyed watching it and will do so often.
B002GYS1FO|5.0|Heavy Rock Fire that keeps you dancing, and singing and rocking all night long.  Is it just me or has the world forgotten about rock, and rhythm?  The Heavy has not and I love them for it!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|A bit disappointing for a Steven King novel.  Not quite what the title suggests, but worth buying.  Not one I would stay up late to finish.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|IS there a 10 rating here?  There should be!<br />Can we have yet another standing ovation for the the animators....Really!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|Some of the words are hard but you should get this game. Like coffee break was hard for me or there is a word  that I'm stuck on right now. It has to do with air.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Wonderful Blues-y Rock...it gets better on every playing!<br />And can we have yet another standing ovation for the band and these vocals....Really!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works wonderful, it's and excellent option if you have an HDTV but doesn't  want to buy an expensive smart TV. The streaming is really good, even if you have a slow connection.<br />Works perfect, both with Android and iOs, easy to install and set up. The biggest issue I found is the lack of apps to used it from a Smartphone or tablet, but it is easy to resolve if you install Google chrome and the extension for your PC/Mac.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I have greatly enjoyed playing this game. Fantastic story, unbelievable graphics, great characters. I can't wait to see what is next. G5 games are always exceptional.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I did not enjoy this book as much as the last two it felt like nothing got done I will get the 4th book but I hope it is better then this one
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this app for months to get on the kindle fire. Now I can show all my friends that I'm a pro in candy crush just like them! I I'm super happy that it's here and I can't wait to play it :D!!!!!
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Fun game. People who don't like puzzle games don't play it. If you like small adventure puzzle games, play it. You will not regret it. 5/5 All the way from me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. It kept me busy and I never got so frustrated that I gave up. You will enjoy this game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book gave me everything!<br />Yes, God!  What a talent!<br />A great kid with a gift, check.<br />A tormented, well meaning, flawed adult hero, check.<br />A cast of supporting characters I really liked, check.<br />And, a very well done arc connecting the past and the present.<br />Crazy old Dad, Jack T., even made a redeeming appearance.<br />Happy endings with SK are not guaranteed - ever, so I love that this ending was a happy one.<br />I have decided to forgive him for the way The Dark Tower series ended.  Hugs all around!
B004YXE438|4.0|Love the different difficulties, makes the game usable by a much larger audience. Tons of different images! Great puzzle game for the price.
B000EXZI14|5.0|Purchased c.d. and dvd. Listen to the c.d. at night when I'm in bed, and in the car. Watch d.v.d. with family and friends.<br />The sound is amazing....so there it is!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|This game is ok....similar to 80 days, but that game is much better.  With this game, the scam is that if you don't get through levels successfully, you have to sit in time out for almost 20 minutes unless you want to pay money.  Despicable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Absolutely love this game. There aren't many games that I actually like but this is one of those game that just pulls you in.
1476727651|5.0|Such an amazing book! You will never look at RVs the same! There are many surprises that come out from the first book! If you liked The Shining you will love Doctor Sleep!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is the BEST Movie!!!  Love, love, love Christina A....as I had NO idea of her enormous talent before seeing this film!  Now I am her,biggest fan!  Great story...loved the plot, the color, costumes, singing and dancing...it was,like one of the great old musicals...but in modern times.  OUTSTANDING!
B007GYM86M|5.0|This book takes direct quotes from those who knew John from all,stages of his life.. As a lifetime admirer of his work, there is no better way to appreciate the artistic genius .
B000VYX8PE|4.0|Spoilers<br />In the bad beginning a series of unfortunate vents starts with a bang and thirteen more to come. It is about violet (14) , klaus (12) , and sunny (infant) baulderdaire. There parents die in a fire so Mr. Poe a close friend sends them to love with a distant relative named Count Olaf. Count Olaf abuses the children and tries to get the fortune their parents left behind. Overall I gave the book four stars- Julia age 9
B00COCY67A|5.0|awesome collection of  Elvis  at his best and shows a different side to Elvis in one collection that shows how versatile he was
B007N3206E|5.0|I was very happy about this product, it arrived on time and in the describe way it was supposed to arrive, I was happy and thanks once again
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to use and always up to date. Wish I'd gotten it sooner. Good to have when camping. I check it first thing in the morning before heading out.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great conclusion. A new evil foe more dangerous than Diogenes on the loose! A little disappointed that Pendergast failed to act at an important point in the story. Didn't seem like him at all. Pendergast fans won't be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only negative thing I can say is that you should be able to play the request back to back instead of waiting 24 hours. It should also be easier to play the request instead of disconnecting from Facebook. Game is very addicting.
B00AYB1CDO|5.0|This was an amazing movie! The organization and message that is delivered without a single word, is definitely something that is not an easy task to pull off, but this movie does not disappoint. If you want to see the world from a different perspective, experience an unspoken look into the different cultures of the world, and see how culture clearly does not change the human spirit, you will enjoy this movie. There are a few scenes in the movie that will make you wonder why we behave the way we do, when it is clear that our similarities as humans are not fully seperated by culture, but only appear that way on the outside. One thing to keep in mind when watching this movie, it is not a new movie, the filming was done in 1993, so it's not going to have the sound and detail that a newer BluRay would have. However,  it is extremely well done, and if you enjoy documentaries and seeing the world clearly as it is, and not how it is made out to be in the media, etc... don't miss out on this one!
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Why do film makers think that they can improve on the original story? They can't. There was no reason that they couldn't have kept to the real story and in not doing so the film is the worse for it because it is not he Hobbit.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun and so very addictive! Recommended for anyone who enjoys match and puzzle games! I must warn you though it is hard to put down once you begin!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed...grew up with the comics movie is based on...brought back my childhood and introduced the characters to a new generation
B00555X8OA|5.0|Valuable insight  into how, in so many different and non-conflicted situations, we must check our perceptions. As a Psychiatrist  I help my patients do that about their past and present. Now I am paying equal, if not  more, attention to my own conclusions in and out of the consulting room..
B00BLCHL4Y|5.0|I have been down on History Channel lately calling it Non History Channel with all the reality swamp people, ice road, strip logging, sharp shooters low cost reality kick they are on wondering what does all this crap have to do with history. I have been personally boycotting reality TV except for Pickers(which does mix history) and Travel ( has to be reality). Anyway what a great series, I'm not sure what I was doing on the nights this originally aired but I was asleep at the wheel. Oct 19 History aired the entire series in a marathon and I was hooked about midway through the first episode, I'm ordering the set now the next morning. At least History Channel has hit a 2 run homer with Hatfields and McCoys and a Grand Slam with Vikings. This series of shows has it all and the producers might not be 100 percent historically accurate but I really enjoy and learn from the sub plots and story lines. The differences between Christianity and Norse Gods, the plaque, human sacrifaces to the gods, Earls and structure of different groups of people, leading up to exploration of going West. They might be a little over the top with Radnar but all the other characters are very good and well done. I have always been not well educated on the differences of Catholic, Protestant, Norse Gods and Europe on a whole religion thing which had  everything to do with exploring and settling the new world and all else. I just like Athelstan in there as a captured Monk now slave to Radnar's family and the way the differences in Norse believes and Christianity are showed with his character.  The settings and props this is not low budget in any way.  The different characters are great and the development just make this series totally engrossing and the footage and location settings are pretty darn good as well(hopefully a lot is really Scandavia). I'm of Swedish and Danish decent and have always wanted to learn more about the Viking Era but I am slow as molasses at reading big books and the movieswell there is more to the Vikings than Kirk Douglas dancing on oars with eye patch and the 13th Warrior. The episode with the 9 human sacrifaces to the gods every nine years and land dispute I found amazingly done.  I can't wait for season two and maybe have to look at, if the money History Channel is saving with all the low cost reality crap they can put into real History like Vikings & Hatfields maybe it is some kind of trade off.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|It does work great with the monoprice lightning cable, however, which is apple certified!  My wife has this case and loves it.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|The Headline says it all you cant go wrong with 24 it has it all, good guy bad guy out of nowhere
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show, every episode is gripping right from the very start. Great characters, excellent acting that keeps you wanting to see more.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|What a thriller and an excellent view into the Russia during the Cold War! Can't wait to read more with a great leading character.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|It does not offer the features that a web page does.  The mobile is very limited but it works but I wish it was as easy to use as the regular over the web.
B00634UVX8|5.0|When I first bought this book, I had no idea what it was going to be about. When it comes to Orwell, I have always preferred his essays, particularly, Books v. Cigarettes. I read Animal Farm when I was in high school, around 7 years ago (around year 10), and its been around six years since I've read 1984, so that's a while. So, I am not up to scratch with his major hits. For uni 2 years ago, I read Keep the Aspidistra Flying, and I enjoyed that. So when I first picked up this book, I had no idea what to expect.<br /><br />After 11 pages, I absolutely hated it! It wasn't pulling me in, and I was bored!! I wanted to put it down, and never open it again<br /><br />I pushed through though, and it got better.<br /><br />I'm going to come-out and say this, I regard it as the most inspiring book I have ever read! not even kidding. I place it up there next to Freedom From Fear by Aund San Suu Kyi on my list of inspiring books.<br /><br />I loved how honest and candid this book is. There are so many poignant moments which play on your emotions.<br /><br />As you're reading along you think his situation can't get any worse, and it does, I found it shocking. We learn that there were days he went without food, and he would have to sell the clothes on he's back just to make ends meat. He writes that he was working around 18 hours everyday as a dishwasher, just to work and make money.<br /><br />We also learn lots about the culture in Paris, especially in regards to the homeless and those living in poverty. He goes into detail about why there are so many homeless people in Paris, and talks about laws which exist there.<br /><br />The number one thing I got out of it though, is that in life, we need to do things we don't want to do to get where we really want to go. George Orwell didn't want to work as a laborer, but he had to. He didn't instantly become an amazing writer, he started from the bottom, and made his way there. This book is all about sacrifice and doing what you needto, before doing what you love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a good game to pass time. My niece is really good at it. She wants it but shes 4 years old! HAHAHA! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE IM NOT AUGUSTINA IM LUCY AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU LIVE
B00004XMTJ|3.0|This is a movie version of the Broadway stage production. They use digital special effects in several scenes that are very effective and do not detract from the performance. The  show itself is excellent except for one very major flaw. There is a scene that has been deleted from this version. That particular scene is &#34;Growltiger's Last Stand&#34;, one of the poems in T.S. Eliot's poems &#34;Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats&#34;. This is the scene where Growltiger and his lady friend Griddlebone are on the barge in the Thames when the Siamese cat &#34;horde&#34; come calling on Growltiger to take revenge. This vignette has always been in the live stage presentations that I have attended. I feel cheated at having this scene deleted and especially of not being informed of the deletion before my purchase. However, because I love this show and because the rest of the DVD is so good as well as there being no alternative I will keep it.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I bought this set (preorder) for a sister's birthday gift. She loves it. She says the only problem is the Phaser does not work on stun.<br />She wants to stun anyone that takes it off her Star Trek shelf and play with it. She has not tried the kill phase, yet.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|If you enjoyed the movies you will love playing this game! Its a blast to build your own island.  It is for all ages!
B00FPH6A70|5.0|A great scary movie! I have not seen one this good in a while. The movie flows well and the story line is believable.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|No scratches on CD. Price is right. Delivery time was great. No problems. My daughter doesn't listen to her CD anymore but that is just personal preference. She listened to Selena a lot when she first got the CD.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have this game on every one of my devices. So excited that is finally on the Kindle.<br />I am so addicted to this game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As I figured it works as planned.  I glad I decided to give it a try and hope updates gives the device even more usefulness. It worked out of the box as noted.
031623480X|5.0|Love This Book. Have Been watching What I Eat. Have Lost Weight and Off Some Of My meds. Feeling Better!!!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Don't really have a review. But this is the best book in the series! Hate that Rick's going to end the new series October next year.
B0067RQYNW|1.0|Probably one of the worst apps I've used.  It quit on me several times, is not very easy to use, and maintains too many old versions rather than saving into one new file.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Well writte.  I was able to figure out the bad guy before he was revealed.  Kept a good pace.  Sometimes a little too violent.  Only one subtle reference to an actual killing floor which was kind cool.
B00B10HAO2|1.0|This movie was recommended to me. I found it to be immediately boring and the pace never changed. I couldn't even get through it despite having paid good money to watch it. HUGE MISTAKE. DO NOT waste your hard earned money or time on this. It's just terrible. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I have to find time to finish it, but it started out good and hopefully it continues to be good.  I don't buy that many books but I have several that I have to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is amazing, it's so addictive yet challenging.. Not to mention it's FREE!! The knock off candy crush games were $1.99, why would I get that when I can get the real on free? I suggest you buy this app.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Incredibly great sounding. Excellent hooks, heavy rhythms. Previously not a fan of AX7, but I am now. One of the best of 2013!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This is now my favorite game besides Words with Friends. I love the fast pace of this game and that as you play and win you &quot;level up&quot; and get coins.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Best free game I have played. Very addicting. The plastic physics and different feel of the myriad of vehicles makes this a great game. Many many tracks are available as well.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very addicting and fun. I've been playing it since Feb and I can't stop lol great game
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Did not work properly on my kindle, continually froze so I deleted it, and this is the reason I am giving a rate of 3stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is addicting during class I hide my phone just so I can play if I just,barely got this game as well I probably can play it in my sleep also when I'm connected to face book I can see where my friend are I'm the first I'm winning yes

B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset, it is the best headset I ever have tested!<br />Sound and Mic is very good, and this headset is very nice on your head.<br />One thing that I don't like is that the USB you get with the headset don't have any protection.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Game is great really fun and challenging.<br />It also helps you get your mind off of stressful things.<br />The only negative part is that we run out of lives.<br />Really recommend this game otherwise
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  Been playing it for the last 7months on my smartphone.  It's great playing it on my kindle fire now. The graphics are great!! What took you so long? Thank you again.
B005K17RU0|3.0|No rational reason for a weather app to need half the privileges it requires. Looking at other accounts on the phone?  Blocking sleeping?<br /><br />And why does it require being logged in to Amazon App Store?<br /><br />Overall, it was an okay app before, but the privileges demanded smell bad, like spyware.<br /><br />Uninstalling rather than updating.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|Jad to waste three bottles to know how to finally make one right, but its worth it, clear instructions but trial and error is needed, good luck!
B0009353IW|5.0|Whenever I hear a superbly produced enticingly different and very musical song, many times it is by Ry Cooder. I wish industry recording would have standards with the same clarity as recordings by Ry Cooder This theme album has proven to be very interesting and enjoyable (historically and musically). Beautiful in it's entirety yet each song can stand alone well. I want to get more of Ry's stuff. He is very prolific. I'm happy to hear his music every so often on my local PBS as other stations don't give him much, if any, airplay.
B001EN71DG|5.0|its awsome haveing the originals theartrical versions the other discs can go in the trash!none of the added stuff that really didnt fit with the movie and ruined the feel of it,they came pretty quick too.make sure you get the one with vader and luke duelling on the front i read that there is another set with just vader on it that does not have the originals if thats what you're looking for
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|coolest app ever very graphic Intels detail about everything should have been made into a game I would def buy it
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The show is outstanding in essentially every facet; the writing, acting, and directing are all first class.  This is one of the best television series of all time and has plenty of extras to satisfy those who are into that.  I was just happy to get the show itself for such a reasonable price.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|Works great, keeps all the leaves and debris out of the pool so less cleaning required which I really enjoyed.
0375413405|5.0|Every recipe I've tried is a success.  I've made half a dozen or so and I've only had the book a couple of weeks.  There are no photographs of how the food is supposed to look once prepared but Julia is pretty thorough in her description.  I think this is a nice addition to any cookbook collection.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Debra & the Band Blondie puts the best of Blondie's tunes here with 3 versions of Heart of Glass,  2 of Telephone (Call tune) and onus tunes including. Great album ofAwesome Blondie!~~~~
B00F880BWG|5.0|Neither my husband nor I are fans of horror or zombies. We don't have cable and generally only watch documentaries. TWD has changed all of that. We absolutely love this show!<br />Personally, I preferred seasons 1 and 2 over the 3rd. By the end of last season I was ever so slightly less enthusiastic then I had been. I didn't enjoy the  conflict between the two large groups as much as the more personal struggles the earlier shows focused on. I also began to find the shows just too depressing. The occasional moments of humor, friendship and joy seemed to get less and less common as the season went on. Obviously, a show dealing with the sort of events portrayed is not likely to be a comedy or a barrel of laughs and I wouldn't want it to be. However, in my book, a vital part of surviving in that sort of world would be to find those occasional moments of love, laughter and happiness. Otherwise, what's the point?<br />I am delighted to report that season 4 seems to have kept all the things I love about the series and brought back just a bit of the hope and humor. I absolutely loved the premier and am awaiting each new installment with baited breath! On top of everything else the new season is heading into yet another plausible, interesting direction to help keep things fresh and new. Bravo!
1401938906|5.0|I would recommend this book to any one interested in learning how we manifest .... this book takes the secret to a whole new experiencial level - a practical handbook of understanding and working with energy to create matter.  Try it and you will experience what was once only a theory in your own mind...the book is also easy to read and FUNNY because the author is a witty and funny woman!  A book Einstein would love no doubt!  Read it and do it today!
1476727651|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, although I wouldn't say it's my favorite one SK has ever written (I have them all).  It was not nearly as terrifying as The Shining, which I read immediately prior to this book to make sure I was fresh, but it definitely holds its own.  It was a really enjoyable read, but don't look for huge scares out of this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love, love, love this website.  So many cool things to discover and a great tool for inspiration.  I visit every day!
B00A285OOW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Phillips Gregory has done it again by weaving a tale of suspense, love, and betrayal.
B0073ODRKG|2.0|After listening the whole collection, I have ended up with a bittersweet feeling...I did enjoy very much those fun-catchy hits I grew up listening to , but usually when you buy an artist cd you end up finding unknown gems that become very close to your heart, nice surprises that you were not expecting when you bought the cd. The thing with madonna is that the rest of the cd is always dreadful, bloody awfull, filled with songs that sound so amateurish. It feels they are put there just to complete the required minutes for an album. I guess she could have made her career releasing singles only (the hits) and be equally famous and successful. As a fair evaluation of a body of work, besides the unquestionable vocal shortcomings, the veridict doesnt meet the expectations of her royal title as the queen of pop.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed was one of my recommendations on Kindle and I thought I'd give it a go. I started out liking the book but slowly started to become more and more obsessed with the characters. I finished the whole thing in a day! If you're into romance novels, this is one that you'll love. I laughed, I cried, I just can't even explain how much I love this book. Colleen Hoover has bumped her way up to the top of my favorite authors list. Can't wait to read the rest of the Slammed series!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I can't stop watching - I'm waiting for next episodes - very good courtroom drama. Impelling characters and good story line.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a LONG book, but truly entertaining and not in the typical Stephen King creepy way.  It puts a different spin on JFK's assassination and throws some si-fi in with time travel and of course, a love story.  Great book!
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I love the first fruit drop game. I love this one as well real cute and I do not have anyone nagging at me to spend money buy the game and it is really yours.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's Pintrest - what's not to love?  Great ideas and recipes you might not otherwise have come up with on your own.  My son says it was invented by men to get women back in the kitchen . . . ouch!!
B00CHILW64|1.0|\\"The Impossible\\" looks like a great movie, but I could not get the sound to come in...it was all garbled.  I would like to try downloading it again, but do  not want to risk wasting the $5 again.
B003L77G6A|5.0|What a great team of actors that compliment each other rather than taking the spotlight. Received it used from GoHastings which is also great. It came extremely fast and true to their description. Will continue to buy The Big Bang Theory series from them.
B000000XB9|3.0|The sound/songs don't exactly sound like the originals?<br />CCR, but this sounds a little different. what was actually done in reproducing this records?
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|The Grey is an outstanding movie.  It takes the deepest fears of humanity and lays them bare for all to see like the wreckage of an airplane on a glacier.<br /><br />The story revolves around an Irish hunter hired by an oil company to protect drillers in the Arctic spaces of the North American continent.  He gets on a plane with his co-workers all manly, blue collar men who make up the Armed Forces, keep the streets in good repair, etc.  These are the un-tamed, un-PC (mostly) white men of America who themselves can tame nature and laugh at death-if only for a while.<br /><br />The plane crashes.  The crash scene is portrayed with a stark realism.  The survivors must now face death and nature.  The survivors head away from the aircraft to find help.  One-by-one wolves start to chase them and pick them off.<br /><br />They plead for help from the almighty but do not get it.  The existentialism of this movie is a theme alongside primal fear.  Indeed existentialist philosophy is itself a study of fear.<br /><br />The ending of this movie matches what one expects and encourages all to meet their fate bravely.<br /><br />Don't use this film to learn about wolves and wolf behavior and there are many uses of a particular Anglo-Saxon word.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Game is enjoyable and the graphics are great.  I have the same game on my laptop and I really enjoy playing this game. I am 75 years old and the instructions are easy to understand and  is very entertaining.  Very glad that it is on Kindle so that when I have to go into doctors offices or other waiting rooms I have this game to pass the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing.  The limit on lives is actually helpful or I'd probably play all night.  In app purchasing would let you continue playing with extra lives.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|I like light hearted humor without violence & sex & vulgar.<br />You feel better after watching it. Take a break & laugh
B00CP4RZCU|5.0|Saw them on Gigantour tour; always good live.  First CD is better than second in my opinion but I'm just one among many.  Zach needs to give us some new stuff.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another wonderful book from an excellent story teller! So hard to put it down .. and easy to get &#34;into&#34;.
B005XI94HY|5.0|I love this album and all that Florence has to offer. This album has great work done on her part as well as her band. Would recommend to any Florence + The Machine fans.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun game, beat it in a couple hours though.  It did keep me interested through the whole game, it just went too quick.
B00138GZAC|5.0|A very noteworthy compilation of Sade's work. This album serves as a great cocktail hour album or just something to relax to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing on Facebook but so excited to finally have this game on my Kindle!!!  This game drives me nuts at times but it's so much fun I keep on playing! I enjoy the challenge!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|This is a classic album by Nirvana that any one could vouch for. Just bought it to add to a workout mix. This worked out well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is realistic and fun. I really enjoy playing it since I don't have a horse of my own right now
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The strange twists and turns our lives take us around. What would have happened if I had not done...? What would have happened had I not broken up with...? Would my life be worse? Better? The same? Wouldn't it be nice if we knew all the answers... If we could look ahead into the future and see the different paths out life could take and choose which path to take... But that's far too easy. Great and wonderful read, a few tears will be shed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written drama with witty humor. One of the better series out there on amazon prime. Holds your interest episode to episode.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I ordered this because my husband and I really love this movie.<br /><br />The silliness of these guys, &#34;I thought you were a toad&#34; is hilarious.<br /><br />Then to watch George Clooney 'sing' in overalls just makes me laugh out loud.  This is a movie to really make you laugh!
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I love classics, and this to me is a classic!  The quality of the stream was great. Clear sound and clear picture.  Will definitely come back for more!
B004N6369Y|4.0|This is not one of Danielle Steel's typical novels, you know, the mail person is blonde and rich.  This is such a sweet story about a father and daughter that start this hotel back up to a 5 star hotel and  how the daughter learns hotel management and takes over the hotel.  Such a sweet story.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I don't know how they keep doing it, but they do.  Every time an episode ends, I'm surprised how quickly the time went by and I'm disappointed it's over!  I only have a few select must watch shows on my list and this is at the top!
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|My child never gets tired of this book. It's wonderful to watch her learn and repeat the phrases. Good purchase.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Have non problem changing my review because I really like Rush-but what are the names of the albums? Maybe its me, where do you find the information for this compilation.Oh, wait a minute-they name them in the last paragraph of the description. Sometimes the band has nothing to dop with how they are marketed-so put it to five stars but my critique remains the same.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have become a great fan of the newer cartoon features being created today by so many talented artists and writers.  I am very happy with the quality of this DVD.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Never ever get tired of watching this classic.  Tom Hanks is great.  Highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.  Great viewing.
B00AEFY3MC|5.0|I am a long time fan of Star Trek and this movies was absolutely a riot!!  I was very happy to find you had this in stock and have enjoyed viewing it many times.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|This was my second Malcolm Gladwell book.  I thought that the author failed in a well-meaning attempt to distinguish \\"thin-slicing\\" from what I have always thought of as a \\"first impression.\\"  I found it a bit tiresome when he kept referring back to a big mistake on the part of a sophisticated museum and using that example to illustrate a point.  After reading about his views on why an expert could identify which marriages were in trouble, Gladwell really lost me.  I thought I was beginning to read a book where the premises were based on \\"junk science.\\"  However, I read on and finished the book and found most of the chapters entertaining and some even provocative, especially the section about police training and behavior.  I admire Gladwell's attempt to draw conclusions based on the ability of humans to make super fast judgments, since I do agree that these abilities exist.  My objection is that so many variables enter into a person's decision-making that it is risky to count on quick impressions for certain types of human behavior.<br /><br />The organization of the chapters seemed a bit strained, and I would have preferred a more scientific approach to the subject matter.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original series and was really amused with this new story set in our modern world.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Marvelous story telling! This is an engaging book from the very start! You won't be able to put it down & it will likely be a re read later!
B003UESJF6|5.0|I have become a great fan of the newer cartoon features being created today by so many talented artists and writers.  I am very happy with the quality of this DVD.
0307271080|5.0|Adichie is a real old fashioned story teller.  This Epic is beautifully written and a real page turner.  The cultural references and experiences were easy to appreciate because they are universal, proving that we humans are more alike than different.  I have added Nigeria to my &#34;bucket list&#34; of places to visit should the political climate there every settle down.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|DVD was in great shape and I'm happy that I'll have a blue ray copy when I purchase a blu ray player.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|just a regurgitating of the story in the Gospels. Not much new insight. I bought the book expecting to find more information about the idea that the New Testament is a creation of the Romans to move the blame for the crucifixion from themselves to the Jews. an interesting idea I read in one of the reviews but I didn't find anything about this in the book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a great story. King appears to have put a great deal of research into this book. I loved the ending.
0553062182|5.0|Was extremely beneficial in understanding, tools to work with, and insightful.  Thank you Dr. Aron for making people aware and helping us 'left handers' in a 'right hander' country.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan train takes you to a different time and place long forgotten. A beautiful story well told. I truly enjoyed.
B005FDWM6M|5.0|Classic movie! Always a good warm hearted movie to watch. I've always enjoyed this movie since I was a young child.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|A well written and very well described novel. I'm a great fan of James Bond, but not very fond of war stories. This read about Ian Fleming was very interesting though. If you love history and war stories, this book is definitely for you.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Dear reader,<br /><br />Movies depicting children like this is so sickening i almost threw up watching this. Yes, I did see the beginning of one of the predating Japanese movies like this one until i felt sick, wanted to cry a little, and turned if off once I caught on to the plot.<br /><br />If it was a documentary about child soldiers in Africa then I can see how one can sit down and watch children killing each other, but for sheer entertainment?<br /><br />I don't understand how people watch this like it's okay. If anyone actually likes this movie, I strongly suggest they re-evaluate themselves.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />a concerned human being
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It took a little for me to be able to connect to the Wi-Fi network. But just re-entering the password solved the problem. It works well, although I wish you could to more things with it (such as streaming your phone videos and photos)
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is an exciting seek and fine that is very mysterious. It has you go from one scene to another finding different items. And if the time runs out then you have to redo the scene with a whole new set of items in different places. The game also brings different modes to play the scenes I .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so well crafted and so witty that the reader was immediately invested in the characters.  It is rare that I find a book that I will finish in sitting let alone think about for days after I've finished reading it.  I don't want to give any spoilers away, but I think this book should be considered one of the best modern YA books written.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Wow.....What a great match 3 puzzle game.  If you like matching games, then this game is meant for you.  Lots of fruit that turns into jelly jars and before you know it you are on the way to stuffing your pantry with all kinds of jelly.  Seriously, this game can be challenging and loaded with fun.  I know if you try it, you'll be playing it constantly just for the fun of it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Really good, low price, good picture quality and excelent if you have a netflix account. However, im still waiting for more improvements, like cellphone mirroring and having other apps working on it, such as pandora and songza.
B00BV9RZSO|5.0|This is in my opinion their greatest album. Not usually the type of music i'm into, but love all the songs, love the album cover, Instant classic. This is also my first vinyl and i'm really enjoying the experience.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is an awesome wireless headset, especially for the price.<br /><br />After extensive research on headphones & -sets, I bought it as a gift for a guy friend and it was very well-received, with the next few hours spent happily figuring out how it works and playing with it. It does a decent job of sound isolation, especially for a wireless headset- I can't count how many times I've had to go over to my friend and tap him to get his attention because raising my voice was no longer enough. He also hasn't had any complaints with the mic quality nor the range the wireless provides. In fact, he does mention that it's quite comfy (a fact I can now attest to, having tried it for myself once), even with his rather large head, and that the side buttons can be programmed with different keys/actions for each game he plays.<br /><br />I will note that it's a little hefty, so it could fall off one's head with a bit of shaking/nodding, but that's really not a problem generally.<br /><br />I can only end by saying that my friend likes it more with every use. Sounds like a win to me! :)
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|A riveting story, beautifully told. The prologue sets the stage for what is to unfold: an unspeakable sacrifice by a father, driven by poverty and hardship. Hosseini provides extensive detail to provide the reader with a rounded understanding of the main characters and their lives. As is always the case with Hosseini's novels, this is a great read.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|el product is good but no play all video and all display... and block my tv o turn off and turn on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush. On fb so happy it on the kindle now.  Have been waiting almost a year for it to come to the kindle fire HD. Just hope it not glitchy downloading it noe.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could only get it on my Android phone but now that I have it on my kindle fire hd I will give it a five star.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great game!!! I really encourage you to get this!! WARNING it might be slightly adictive and hard to put down. It also takes half an hour for 1 live to build up. You have 5 lives in total, it is FREE, it is FUN, and it just became available in the app store again! PLEASE GET THIS APP IT IS SSOOOO WORTH IT!!! YAY!
0920668372|5.0|Have loved this book for the last 27 years .... the age of my son.  I would recommend it for all newborn boys!!  Love the illustrations too.
0307346617|5.0|I got this book because of the zombie survival guide and just wanted to get all his stuff so i got this awesome book :3 cat face yeah!!!!!
B00E1LT41K|5.0|While the books and the miniseries are based on History this and other Phillip Gregory books are Historical Fiction and I think people are forgetting that. The story is compelling because we don't know what REALLY happened. No one does except for those who were there. No one should expect this to be History lesson. It should be taken for what it is. If you want historical accuracy I think you should not watch a movie based on a book that is clearly labeled FICTION!
0486407217|3.0|This is an excellent resource for experienced costumers and historians who specialize in late Victorian.  Possibly I didn't research carefully enough before buying.  Also, the patterns are reprinted from historic magazines, so you need to know how to create and size your own pattern from the diagrams and understand 19th century dressmaking techniques.  Not for the casual sewer.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|My order came very fast, was sold out many places - but they had it! Very impressive<br />service that I hope to continue to do businss with. Kudos!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|I am a huge Cher fan and have every album and cd she ever made.  This is perhaps the best yet.  You get the unmistakable powerful Cher vocals in a mixture of fun dance hits and great ballads.  I have the deluxe cd and am glad I got it because &#34;I Don't Have to Sleep To Dream&#34; is my favorite dance song on the cd.  But believe me all the dance songs are high energy fun.  &#34;Dressed To Kill&#34; is a divalicious classic.  &#34;Pride&#34; is an anthem for the club crowd.  I think &#34;Lovers Forever&#34; is a throwback to the 80's electronic dance mixes.  The layout of the cd is genius with the pulsating beats and the beginning and the strong ballads at the end.  You will definitely enjoy &#34;I Hope You Find It&#34; it was originally performed by someone called Miley Cyrus no one will ever remember her performance after hearing a true singer like Cher blow it out of the water!  Just buy it and enjoy it all.  I know you will!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I found this movie to be very very good..  It is very intense, but I'm pretty sure this happens more often than we actually hear about.  We ALL need to be praying for praying for our soldiers.
B0044WUIHA|5.0|We had a young friend staying with us whom had never seen this movie.  It was the 3rd time for me and I still thoroughly enjoyed viewing it again!!  Hanks should have won the Best Actor Oscar this year instead of Russell Crowe!
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I haven't even opened this special edition one, but I have the regular older version, but I know it's all good.  This is for sure, one of my favorite movies of all time. If you haven't had time when you have time to sit back, relax, & want to watch an awesome movie, this would be it.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|hauntingly simplistic and beautifully powerful. A repertoire rendered spectacular by its stunning transmutation into something beyond the original, which was already easily beyond our wildest dreams. PG takes it to amazing new heights; so if there is blood pumping through organisms in this other amazing world, then it is not of this earth...truly amazing stuff. Hope you caught it live!!!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Absolutely love the this band. I'm just a little slow on picking up all of their cd's. This one is wonderful!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|After reading The Shining many years ago, I have been curious what happened to Danny and Wendy.  Now I know.  I enjoyed this book very much.  Some great turns and twists.  Must read for Stephen King fans.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|Tried lots and lots of tutorials. When it does work, its lots of fun. But don't get too set on it working every time, or even 50% of the time.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|I am a 60 year old Dylan fan who is attracted to any performer who breaks new ground and seems unconcerned about what is expected of them. For me Miley is a unique and ground breaking performer and I will tell you why.<br /><br />On her album, &#34;Breakout&#34; she sings of feminine situations that are separate from and independent of any relationship a with a male figure. Certainly she sing about sexuality and romance, but often she sings from the perspective of the person who is in control of the relationship, not the one dependent or at the mercy of the male counterpart.<br /><br />Examples include: &#34;Breakout&#34;, &#34;Fly on the Wall&#34; and 7 Things I Hate About You&#34;.<br /><br />On Bangerz she continues this theme on songs such as &#34;SMS Bangerz&#34;,<br /> &#34; #GETITRIGHT&#34;, &#34;FU&#34;,  and &#34;Someone Else&#34;<br /><br />Over and over again Miley Cyrus sings from a feminine perspective that while partly a result of feminism is one of the first post feminist artistic expressions.<br /><br />Her feminine power is natural to her. Part of who she is, not who she would like to be.<br /><br />Other great songs that combine pop, rock, rap, hip hop and a country twang include:<br />4x4, Adore You, Wrecking Ball, Love Money Party, Drive and Do My Thing<br /><br />Finally, the album , &#34;Banger'z&#34; incorporates the power of &#34;hip hop&#34; and &#34;rap&#34;, known for their misogynistic attitudes to express feminine power with an aggression that is new, cool and substantial all at the same time.<br /><br />This album is a pop masterpiece which will hopefully get the respect it deserves in the combining months.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|A good remake of the of the 69  movie, that has been around for awhile.  I have seen it before numerous times and will watch it again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|even when I am stuck on levels for weeks or maybe even months I still love it thank you for putting on kindle fire.
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|This was a game I'm sure one of the grand kids bought, and I'm sure they love it and play it.  Didn't know I had it but that's okay.  From time to time, when they are bored, they borrow my Kindle and play games on it, and I guess this one is on there.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This game has potential to be good but it is very confusing. They is no direction on how to play. going to uninstall.<br />good luck.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Was happy to find this favorite classic!  Enjoyable and works well on my Kindle Fire HD.  Would recommend to solitare lovers. Nice app.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple Run is a entertaining game. I just love playing it in my spear time. my son showed me how to play it and i just kept on playing it every change i get. It is some what relaxing.
1475143389|4.0|This book is very informative and i found it very helpful. It answered a lot of questions that i couldn't figure out before. Now I realise why I wasn't getting any where in my workout because of the great information Micheal Mathews has in this book. I reccomend this book for anyone. Losing or gaining isn't as hard as it may seem!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|There's an old saying that goes something like...when it is 3 p.m. in the rest of the world, it's 1938 in England. What I love about the modern Gothic novel is how one is never quite sure when the story takes place. There are clues--heroine Margaret Lea wears trousers on the train, \\"types\\" up interview notes made in longhand. We are told that a secondary character went away to war. But was it the First World War or the Second? From the moment the book opens the reader is on uncertain ground, ripe for tension that heightens with every chapter.<br /><br />Diane Setterfield's THE THIRTEENTH TALE took me back to the heyday of the modern Gothic. Victoria Holt. Mary Stewart. I thought of Stewart's chilling THORNYHOLD many times as I read about Margaret struggling to find grains of truth in the fantastical tale the eccentric authoress Vida Winter weaves for her day after day in the rambling old mansion at the edge of the Yorkshire moors. An academically-inclined introvert whose life revolves around her father's antiquarian bookshop, Margaret has been hired to write Winter's biography. But Winter is a storyteller through and through. A liar by trade and by inclination.<br /><br />Margaret is ultra-sensitive about being lied to. When she was nine years old, she learned she had a twin who died at birth. The loss and its cover up has defined her life. Her twin is tangible to her. A ghost that follows her every moment of every day, visible in Margaret's own reflection in a window or pool of water. From her core, she knows she should turn down Winter's commission. And yet the obsessive reader in Margaret needs to learn the truth, to \\"read\\" through to the end of the dying woman's story.<br /><br />Setterfield's prose is gorgeous. Through painstaking scene setting and cut-glass character interactions, she draws us into a world of light and shadow that mimics the secrets and half-truths of Vida Winter's personal history. This isn't a quick or an easy read. The action jumps back in forth in time and the point-of-view at times gets as foggy as one might expect of a story centered in memory. Also, for all its Gothic qualities, THE THIRTEENTH TALE is not a romantic book in the way most contemporary readers have come to define romance. There's no dark knight to sweep Margaret up out of the path of her personal demons. She finds her own way back to firm ground. Once she does, though, there's the definite sense that a happy ending awaits.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from the library, but I liked it so much that I'm buying my own copy. It is definitely a keeper.forth in time and the point-of-view at times gets as foggy as one might expect of a story centered in memory.

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This was a great game<br /><br /> for the whole family. Every one helped and took turns. When we got stuck we helped each other out. It was a great challenge. I would suggest for AGES 5 and up.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I absolutely love this album, especially all the symbolism. It is in frequent rotation in my car's cd player.  Most of the lyrics are clean enough for my toddler to sing along with me as well so that is a huge benefit.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|:) Whoop Whoop<br /> Mamma' s diggin dis app rite now. I don't know what else to say i really just wanted to give it 5 stars:)
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This is A Great and Entertaining Program I recommend it to all! Always a fan of good action and entertaining programs!<br /> Always,<br />  LeAnne M Pruitt
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE! it every girl should have this game. It is AWSOME that it is free.<br /><br />I will never delete it.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|SGU departs from the more campy SG-1 and the completely absurd (often laughable) SGA with some real character development and dynamics between the characters. The juxtaposition of the military personnel with the scientists and the inevitable clash of priorities leads to some truly interesting plot twists as allegiances are tested (and constantly reevaluated).<br /><br />True SF not only has good science behind it (okay, flames in space are still good for action but stretch the boundaries for those of us with any understanding of such things), but should be a good story *without* the science. Like Star Trek, SGU poses a series of morality plays, as it plays out a space opera. Two seasons was too short a run for something of this grand scale, but my review here is limited to the first season, so I won't delve into the series overview in any more detail.<br /><br />The first season gets underway very quickly, with characters establishing their relative importance (and trustworthiness) in short order. Few episodes lag, but when they do, it is usually to set up for something to come next (contrast this with the revamped Battlestar Galactica, where I found almost every ep to drag and seemingly make little progress from one to the next).<br /><br />After a considerable hiatus, I returned to SGU (hey, I get to see these shows for FREE with my Prime subscription; I can't get that from my FiOS service!) and am not in the least disappointed. There is so much detail which I am picking up this time through, and the scripts do not disappoint. Even when I remember an ep clearly, re-watching leaves me quite satisfied and anticipating the next.<br /><br />I won't go into character details here; I'm sure others have described them in some depth. By the 4th or 5th ep, the newcomer should be comfortable with who's who, and having a detailed understanding of SG-1 is *not* required (aside from the stargate itself references to the Ancients, and knowing that Stargate Command is/was &#34;in charge&#34; of the original operation, no real foreknowledge of the SG-1 characters is expected).n charge&#34; of the original operation, no real foreknowledge of the SG-1 characters is expected).
B005ZUR724|5.0|this game is very cool still tryn to figure it out but it is very cool amazon finally got the rights to a awsome game it is very challing and the multiplayer side of the game is very cool well worth the money get this game you wont be disappoint ed
0307387178|5.0|Required reading purchase for my high school student. He enjoyed the book so much that he went on a hunt for the the movie and watched that too.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Only con - stays powered on at all times if it needs to be plugged in via the power adaptor.  Other than that works great.  TV is smart enough to know that once your casting to switch to the chromecast source to view!<br /><br />Great little product for the money.  Great for get togethers, everyone can link to wifi and choose the next video!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|this was one of the better books in the series.. I'm glad I bought it for the kindle makes it convenient
B001BZRUR4|3.0|Another reviewer basically said the same thing.  This was an \\"OK\\" book, very readable, but I had expected more from the author of \\"The Book Thief\\".  I felt the message of the book was rather obvious somewhere at the half way point and could easily anticipate the ending.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|This book is a great and insightful guide to those of us looking for a no BS guide to getting your project/product done and into the market as soon as possible!
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Think of the worst movie you have ever seen.....buy that one...you'll be happier, and won't miss a thing. It is bad
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into when I picked up this book.  I couldn't put it down.  Anita's story was told in such a real and authentic way and paralleled many of the challenges I have faced in life.  It gave me a truly new perspective on how to look at things and embrace all that is light and good.
B00E6F155E|4.0|Great audio accompanies a great performance by Peter Gabriel. This is a must for Peter Gabriel fans. Recommend &#34;Secret World&#34; for the more casual fans.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|I enjoy a good mystery as much as anybody else.  Then why didn't I like this novel more??? 1st ~ the editing needed to be more selective, too many repeat situations~~~the &#34;red pen&#34; needs to tighten it up.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|In the Final Empire there is the downtrodden Skaa, who are treated like slaves, many of whom starve to death, and the noblemen. There is also the Lord Ruler, who oversees everything and is immortal. There is also magic in the form of allomancy, the ability for an individual to burn a single metal (called a misting) and burn all eight metals (called Mistborn). Mistborns are few and far between, however skaa and thief, Vin, is learning more about Mistborn and Mistings, when she discovers she can burn metals. Vin goes on quite the journey when she discovers this talent and leaves her thieving crew, where she is mistreated and abused, and meets Kelsier, who has a plan to overthrow the Empire.<br /><br />I'm getting back into reading epic fantasy and Mistborn came highly recommended from a few friends. After reading the first book I have to ask: why haven't I read a Brandon Sanderson book before? Seriously, why? Mistborn was epicly awesome!<br /><br />The world building and magic are first class, and the adventurous story kept me on the edge of my seat. I have to admit though my favorite part was the allomancy. The ability to swallow a metal and then use that metal to move things or change people's emotions is such a cool concept! Vin believes that she is a \\"good luck charm\\" as she can soothe peoples emotions, which makes her worthwhile to her thieving crew when negotiations are taking part. But when she discovers that she can burn other metals her whole world opens up!<br /><br />I absolutely adored so many characters in this book. Kelsier with his snarky and wonderful sense of humour stood out for me, as did his partner-in-crime, Dockson \\"Dox\\" who is just trying to keep Kell on track. Vin is such an introvert and would rather stick to the shadows and I liked how as her abilities in allomancy grew so did her confidence.<br /><br />Even though Mistborn felt complete as a standalone, I'm looking forward to seeing how things develop in the second book, and what challenges lay ahead for Vin and her friends.lay ahead for Vin and her friends.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Loved the boxed packaging. New special edition, excellent product, great price. Exceeded my expectations. Definitely a must for Supernatural fans!
0374533555|5.0|Kahneman does a masterful job in painting a very clear picture of the differences between system 1 and system 2 thinking.  He provides a thorough discussion of both systems and in so doing, provides explanation for so many of the things that occur on a daily basis in our everyday lives.  This is a must read.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Ok I logged out of my kik and it won't let me log back in.!!!!! It was working perfectly before I logged out but now all of a sudden it won't let me log in or MAKE A NEW ACCOUNT!  PLZZZZZ someone needs to fix this app quick!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously!!!!!!! I recommend not using this app on a kindle fire until someone kind enough will fix it!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very fun game to play. I also have it on my iphone. This game was loaded for my 6 year old granddaughter. It has to compete with many other kind of games she plays. I do like that this game will ask your age so they can gear it to age. She doesn't understand everything on it as far as the goals/missions but still is fun for her. She does lose interest fast and moves on to other games. This game gets extremely hard as you go up in levels. It is not hard to play but to earn acorns, money and land expansions. Acorns are almost impossible to get and the majority of the animals cost acorns. I'm sure they are doing this so we will buy acorn packs. She has a daily bonus that she gets. I don't know if that is just for kids but I don't have this on my game. Beware of updates on this game which I'm sure is important but something bad always seems to happen when these are done. She totally lost her village on one and had to start over. I did one on mine and lost all my friends and had to start over on that part. Hopefully they will get the bugs worked out of the updates quickly. Customer service does try and help out when you have problems.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Not much to say about a CD from an acclaimed musical, it came as described. So it worked and I'm happy with it.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I couldn't get it to open on Kindle HD.  It showed the company logo, then kicked me back to the app store.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|I purchased this book on recommendation of a friend.  While it is very informative, it is a difficult read.  Lots of facts but tedious.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|This has a new sound for John Mayer but still a very well done album. Nice to see him try new things with his music. Am really enjoying Waiting on the Day...he is still one of the best writers in terms of lyrics. Love anything by JM!
B0041KKYCY|4.0|I gave this a 4 star rating.  Fast moving and graphic.  Not for the squeamish.  I prefer this one over the original.  Your sympathies really are with this victim even though I sometimes found my self yelling Will you please get out of there!!  Oh well, if she did then there would be no movie. I recommend if you are into this genre and like a very on your edge of seat film.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|I liked about 3 songs on this cd. The good thing is that I didn't have to pay for it but the singles that were released on the radio were the peaks of this album for me. I'm a huge pop music lover, but this album just didn't really do it for me.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very poor streaming capabilities...have to sit in front of the wireless model to get a decent signal and even then there are constant lags in streaming
B0019N8P2W|4.0|Loved this series while it was on MTV. Great video quality. Able to play all or just select certain episodes. Overall a good investment for fans of the show.
3833160454|5.0|I have had this book in my wish list for a long time and finally decided it was time to get it. When i recieved the book i was not disappointed. This book is full of very useful information. Not only does it go into the details of the making of high quality leather shoes, but it goes into the history and stories of the process from a cobblers point of view. This book has such wonderful information in it that i wish i had gotten it sooner!
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I love this movie. It is dark and has a surprising ending, to which I'm still confused about it. Natalie Portman does an amazing acting job and the score is wonderful. I think the ballet is beautiful to watch and overall one of my favorite movies.
B007L6VR12|5.0|This movie is one of the most wonderful movies I have ever seen. The actors do a great job. There is so much emotion under the surface. You have really feel the movie to see the emotions. Young love is so precious and this movie captures that first love. That first kiss, first feel. There are laugh out loud moments but there is touch story. The movie never goes off track and pulls into the station at the right time. You feel so refreshed and enjoyed the journey. The good bye is hard but you will have a satisfying feeling at the end. I feel Wes Anderson movies are made just for me. Enjoy and soak in the detail of this fantastic movie by a true master.
B009LDCXNY|4.0|Well lets start with the technical stuff.  Packaging and discs are as usual well done.  Good quality audio and no skips in the discs.<br /><br />Content is ok if not awesome.  All 23 episodes are good and most have a deleted scene you can watch but nothing real special.  The commentary on some episodes just isn't that good.  I kept wondering why they bothered to record it.<br /><br />The show itself seems to have come full circle.  In the first years you have the monster of the week where Sam and Dean go find a monster figure out what it is and after almost losing a fight kill it.  In the middle years like from 3 to 5 the show got a little difficult by really screwing with its take on Christianity.  Still well written and very believable.  Years 6 and 7 not so much.  The show had lost its identity and the writers seemed to be scrambling for content,  Well in year  8 I thin k we have the best so far.  We are back to the monster of the week which I really enjoy and a subplot that spans the entire year without infringing to much on the weekly story.  The show has really embraced the flashback style where you can tell two stories in the same episode.  That style is becoming a lot more popular with todays sophisticated audiences.<br /><br />All in all if you love Sam and Dean (And the Impala) it is well worth the money.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I loved it. But I'm also a big Charlie Hunnam fan, so I figured it would be good. The movie had a good story line. I wish I could have seen it in 3D.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Different type of game where you have to look everywhere for aids to help you get keys to get out of the room.  You have to pay special attention to colors, numbers and patterns.  It's challenging but fun trying to figure it out.
B005ILYW1E|5.0|I really enjoyed Blitz! Jason Statham plays his part wonderfully, I have watched it twice and still enjoy it. It is not a show for young kids!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|George Martin has left us hanging and we don't know when we will see the next book about \\"the game of thrones\\" so badly played by so many people.  Great ending to this one and now we must wait for the next one before we know what will happen.  I hear he is busy writing it -
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I really enjoy Suits. The story is interesting, the character development is great and every one of the primary actors play their role perfectly. I often get frustrated with some of the characters, but that only goes to show that they are playing the role they were given. I would definitely recommend this show if you enjoy a mix of genres; some of the episode have me laughing, others have me intrigued, and some even have me frustrated.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I love this game and have learnt to be patient with it to avoid spending any money on it. Love the different pictures
B000NH7SZ0|3.0|Good price. Does its job. Name brand. Used to increase RAM in network printer. Helps with memory intensive print jobs.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|This app rarely stays open long enough to use.  It crashes all the time, and that makes me extremely irritated!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally the real thing for the kindle fire hd, very happy when I seen that I could get the app, love  love love this game
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|Moves a bit slow, but okay game for young children of about 6 or 7 years.  Entertaining enough for us older folks as well.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|addicting needs to give more credits though but overall I love it cant stop playing it everyone should play great past time game
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Gathered a group to watch. Wanted to get ready for the release of the new Movie. It won't play! It plays all the previews, starts the movie and at 2+ minutes it just quits! What a huge disappointment for all of us. Please send one that works!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|The best touch screen rpg game I have ever found. If your in to rpg this is a game for you
B009VMN3RA|5.0|This book left me with a heavy heart. It seems Sachi only wanted what any child wants, the love of her parents. Unfortunately Sachi had two of the worlds most self absorbed parents. This book is beautifully written for all the heaviness it holds. I hope Sachi has found peace and love from within. She's clearly a strong gal who has suffered a lot.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game I like it a lot because it keeps me focused and its fun to play I like to try to pass people up.  I also like how the game changes when it is a holiday it changes to what the holiday has in it. So that's why I like the Game Subway Surfers. Who ever made the game is a brilliant thinker .
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good fun app really enjoy playing when ive got some time to kill. need some more rooms to play but it makes you think.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Overall this app was a good buy and I have been using it for quite a while so I do recommend getting this app.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Of course this game app is fun and addictive!  The desktop computer version never worked very well for me so I'm finally able to play using my Kindle Fire.  Only gave the app four stars because I can't find a way to send my friends lives and power-ups using this version.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love this angry bird game. Its hard but challenging. I hope you continue to bring out these games that are fun. Thanks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great, love it, I want more!!! All of my friends have it have millions of coin. More places to travel maybe more people to play with!!! It's great and can't wait for more!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has umpteen translations of the Bible and you can easily switch between them in a flash.  It's very easy to find just the verse you want.  There are all kinds of features to use along with the Bible.  It must be used with Wi-Fi, but there aren't many places that that is a problem these days.  For serious Bible Study or just the Verse for the day,  this app is the greatest!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|this is free to purchase but not necessarily free to play.Like another reviewer,  I was wondering what the fuss was about and I just don't get it! The only challenge is completing the level within a set amount of moves. if you fail you can either buy more turns or wait 30 minutes. I see people on FB literally begging for extra lives and power-ups and they look ridiculous!!
B00BWRKVVS|3.0|The Emperor's New Groove is undeniably underrated and one of the better movies to come from Disney, with balanced content aimed at both kids and adults. The Blu-ray itself appears to be an excellent transfer and I've no complaints about that. My issue is that for a \\"Special Edition\\" it is severely lacking in the extras department. I had purchased this as a replacement for The Ultimate Groove DVD set (which I loaned to a friend who lost it; stupid me) and had anticipated that it would have the same extras (it's not like a Blu-ray disc is lacking for space... they could have put them on here). I would recommend waiting for Disney's next re-issue.
B00425S1H8|5.0|While not a technical expert, I have purchased this product for our digital signage business over the last 2 - 3 years, and never had a problem with the quality of the product itself.  We have had no failures, even though the RS-232 is installed on over 100 machines, it is a highly reliable adapter, and we have been extremely satisfied with the manufacturer.  Timely delivery on every order, very consistent and reliable sales transactions, and a great product means we are a very satisfied customer!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This series will compete with the works of Patrick Rothfus for my new favourite fantasy series. Highly recommended to any fan of the genre.
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|It's one of those books that appear great not because they are great in themselves, but because they are very well written. The characterization is expert, the description is luscious, the characters are almost Dickensonian in wealth of detail, it'll draw you in.  But you'll get thru all of 800 + pages and might realize that you've read a very ordinary tale, forced into a convoluted shape by an unnecessary conceit. It did not have to be circular, or reflect astrological signs, or invent complex extra characters simply to move them like marionettes from A to B with no internal development.  I think if the author left the whole astrological scheme a secret, then perhaps some determined readers could have discovered it on their own as an extra layer, a sort of private mystery within a mystery; instead of being distracted by it at every turn and being pulled out of the narration by trying to figure out who represents what. As it is, the development of the story disappoints, it drags on long after all the secrets are revealed; and the main characters are shortchanged. I don't want to spoil it, but after reading about every minute impulse of someone peripheral like Pritchard, why is Francis Carver such a stock villain or Emery such a good natured cliche? Why does it build to a sort of crescendo at the trial and then diminishes interminably until you are almost losing interest and ends with a whimper.. Yes, I understand it's the waning moon, but why.  The best compliment I can pay this book is that it's great enough for the flaws not to be overlooked. It begs to be held to a higher standard. I am divided about this book. I am certainly not sorry that I read it, but at times I wished I was reading something else.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|The show has kept our interest from the opening in the first season.  Terrific dialogue, story plot, acting and characters you can care about.  Well done and keep them coming...
B00ENV1HPY|5.0|Can't believe they put out a new album, but I'm glad to have it. If you're looking for innovation or some new dimension to their sound, don't bother. This is classic, timeless, and indisputably at home with the rest of the discography. It fits right along with the rest of their albums when I want to zone out to my Mazzy Star playlist in the car or just chilling at home.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|Their web ads hijack my Android browser and force me onto the Google Play Store page for this app.  With such a slimy business practice, I would not trust this company one bit.  Your personal information is at risk when installing apps.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|All three of my kids (two are boys and one is a girl, she's 6 years) and they all really enjoy playing this game.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I had to read the book twice in order to follow some of the characters and their connection to each other.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easy to write, edit, organize, and share documents. The grid makes it convenient to find them also. I can use evernote on my kindle and cell so things are wherever I am. Overall great app.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|The tight harmonies are captivating and soulful. Love the soundtrack but think you'll like it better if you see the film first. It's a surprise and a lovely movie.
B005CRQ3UC|5.0|Fun and colorful!  My toddler caught onto the story very quickly.  Teaches colors and animals.  She enjoyed this story very much!!
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Wonderful, sweet surprise of a movie. I rented it after accidentally coming across it and reading the review. I loved it so much that I bought it. In fact, I bought several to give as gifts. The actors have great chemistry, and their voices mesh beautifully in this wonderful story.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|Torture from first chapter.  Horrible dialogue with same phrases repeated over and over.  The story might have been interesting if you could get past the writing.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|The watch measures distances very well. GPS signal is very good. Too bad because I had to change it because they stay dead.<br />The technical service is excellent
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|slow moving, but great acting.  Thoughtful, provoking, sad.  Excellent portrayal of the grieving process complicated by the anger of betrayal.
B00FVS4EUI|5.0|Last year I became a fan, I have watched all of the episodes from year 1 until now. The \\"Walking Dead\\" is addictive and a commentary on the human condition not just a sci-fi shock and horror show, although it definitely has those attributes but it also shows the humanity (good and bad) of people working through a catastrophe and what you have to give up to become a survivor. Life is precious, protect it!
B008M721MS|2.0|Ok so like i will be on skype and its awsome but this has happened a couple of times i would press the app to get on it band when i get on its at the logon screen and it says not reconized and ill keep on putting in my info and keeps on saying we do not reconize this so i have probably like 3 to 4 skype accounts cause it does that. I don't no if it is cause i've had for a long time but it makes me SSSOOOOO MMMAAADD.
B00DZVKQGY|1.0|I gave this book only one star because I will never read another book by this author. If you like very graphic sexual language that is very descriptive you will like this book. I do not but maybe it is my age. I am in my mid seventies and do not want to waste my time on this kind of book.
0451450523|4.0|I love this book. Apparently, everyone else does too because the price was not supercheap. I thought I was going to get this cover. I did not, but it was the book, whether or not the cover is what you want is up to you.
030758836X|2.0|I bought this book for a book club I joined and am struggling to finish it. I think it will probably pick up speed in the next chapter or two but till then I will keep wading through it.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Best App Ever! NO ONE WILL EVER CALL THIS DUMB OR THEIR GOIN DOWN! Hope this is the best game of the year.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|so much fun just wish that there was some mention about the number of  lives that you have.  I'm brand new to the game so maybe I missed something.  still love the game!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Just downloaded this application and so far it's been very entertaining. It has kept my interest and helped to pass the time.
B00003CX9S|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL AND HEARTFELT STORIES OF HUMAN COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING. THIS TRUE STORY BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES EVERYTIME I WATCH IT.......IT IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE.....TO GIVE JUST ONE HUMAN BEING A CHANCE AT A GOOD LIFE, NO MATTER WHAT THE FLAWS OR THE DISABILITIES....THEY ALL DESERVE A CHANCE AT HAPPINESS AND THIS MOVIE PROVED JUST THAT.....IT WILL BE ONE TO WATCH OVER AND OVER AGAIN.........GLORIA
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game if it weren't for running out of lives I would be playing it all day long
B000FA57US|5.0|ALL OF THE HALLOWEEN MOVIES ARE JUST AWESOME AND REAL CLASSIC SCARY HORROR.....THESE ARE GENUINELY A CLASSIC HORROR OF ALL TIME ..............GLORIA
B00F3C0GSG|3.0|The DVD and seller were perfect.  The story unfortunately was a rehash ( and a bad one at that) of the old Khan saga.<br />Get some new writers with fresh ideas before embarking on another Star Trek movie.<br />This one left me feeling like I paid to see an Star Trek 2 all over again.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have had this app for around a year and now I can't log into my account any longer because I get errors everytime. I really enjoyed using the app until these problems started.
0393317552|5.0|Professor Diamond makes a most convincing case for the role of geography in determining the advent and evolution of civilizations. He articulates complex phenomena in a way that both is clear and makes sense. This is a classic.
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I don't care what any of the reviews said, I thought it was a great effort. However, it was uneven at times. Storyline could have been more coehesive, etc.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This program is very fast at getting rid of useless temporary files and closing apps which are taking up memory without doing anything useful for you.  The UI couldn't be simpler.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|Great album.  That is all I have to say. Yes sir, best comeback album next to Broken Hope and Gorguts. peace :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun, challenging game. It challenges the brain to think in abstract ways. I had a fun time playing and hope that there will be updates soon.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Lot's of fun and very addictive! Can't wait for the next one!!! Lots of levels for hours (days) of play..
B000035Z3K|1.0|My DVD Dracula came in great condition and very quickly. I was hoping to buy the ORIGINAL Dracula, the one without the LOUD NEW ADDED music and it came! thank you seller for sending me the Original &#34;Dracula&#34; that I had asked for.  I can always count on Amazon's sellers for great quality
B007EC27QM|3.0|If you are looking for a calculator that will do multiple step equations ... this not the app for you. 100-5x5 equals 75 not 475. So if you are looking for a basic one step calculator with a large display  (which I was)  then this is a great app.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Aunque muchos se quejen de que sólo funciona con Youtube y Netflix, yo creo que es lo que más usamos de lejos y por el precio me parece una maravilla, además es muy práctico y cómodo, y sé que dentro de poco habrán muchas aplicaciones compatibles.<br /><br />Although many complain that only works with Youtube and Netflix, I think that is what most use by far and the price seems great, it is also very practical and comfortable, and I know that soon there will be many compatible applications.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|I love this music, excellent music from the Sherlock series. I love to listen to it when I am reading mystery books. I enjoy the Sherlock series and hearing this music just brings it back. Cant wait for season 3.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|Love the CD, as usual.  Pink Martini is my go to tapes for riding in the car. Pleasant listening music. Trying to figure out which language the song is being sung in, is fun too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a great deal of money but it's awesome.  All thats wrong is they don't have a dream bed anymore.
B007N85POS|4.0|Fun and easy enough for a little one to learn.  my soon to be 4 yr old caught on quickly.  but also fun enough for the 11yr old.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I think this is one of the most fun apps I've ever downloaded.  My 8 year old daughter was able to compose many different audio tracks that she is able to use in creating her &#34;videos&#34; - which include photo stills, and bits of video all compiled together to create very creative and moving videos.  I guess every parent says such things as this....I'm blown away by her creativity, talent, and ability to acclimate to using the computer to create art in the form of multimedia!<br /><br />For me, I just love playing around with the app, and love how you can share your creations.  This is one of those apps that you don't wish you'd bought a stick of gum, or bottle of pop, instead!<br /><br />Whoever created this, and whose original idea it was, I applaud them on their vision, and ability to make such a brilliant application for mobile devices.  I look forward to apps from this author in the future!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|Fun game can't wait for the next movie. This is a fun game movement controls are a bit funky. My son loves to just web swing around the city, he thinks it's great.
B00APPMB9I|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  It's one of my favorites.  I think the acting was really good, and the cinematography superb.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!!!!!  (do not read below if you have not watched this movie, please)<br /><br />What I love most though, is simply the idea of it.....how unlocking our complete potential of our minds, we can do anything access anything that we've ever been exposed to in order to allow us to pretty much do anything we want!  Hey, it's great science fiction! And who knows.....it might actually be possible one day... ;)
071815780X|2.0|My husband bought this so we could have fun cooking together every night for a month, on a \\"let's eat healthier, honey!\\" kick. It might sound obnoxious to say so, but I'm being honest when i say I'm a very experienced cook -- and I collect cook books, especially vintage and classic ones -- so I feel I have a lot to compare this one with. And? And we both found \\"15 Minute Meals\\" seriously lacking in a few really important ways. I was almost offended by the lameness of several problems with it, and I felt so strongly about it that I had to come online and write a review. Here are our beefs: 1) We actually -- no joke - timed how long each recipe took to make, over the course of a few weeks, and the \\"15 Minutes\\" claim is total hype and bunkum. It's ridiculous marketing hoo-hah. Yes, we followed his method of boiling water in advance, heating pans in advance, and measuring and laying out the ingredients in advance -- and, no, those steps were NOT counted in the preparation times we recorded -- but our average effort was 45 minutes. This was with two of us, usually, doing the cooking, and neither of us is a beginner. I kept thinking of \\"The 60 Minute Gourmet,\\" the classic cookbook by Pierre Franey and Craig Claiborne of \\"The New York Times,\\" and wishing we'd just stuck with that classic, which not just deals honestly on the time factor but delivers the deliciousness. Because . . . .guess what?  2) More than half of the recipes in \\"15 Minute Meals\\" were definitely not tasty enough to try twice. That's a bad success rate, let's be frank! There is also a ton of repetition of flavors and techniques. Yessiree, this man loves a cutlet pounded flat and dusted with coriander, he sure does! He also really seems to love a big, mushy pile of mushed up grain and vegetables and sauce. Fried or grilled meat on top of soft bed of highly sauced what-have-you-grain is the fall-back formula. Sometimes these recipes were yummy, but more often they were an \\"Huh, hm, it's okay. Not bad-ish.\\"Which brings me to . . . 3) Wow, these are actually quite complex and high-effort recipes, especially considering the \\"meh\\" payoff. They tend to be three-tier recipes, where you're cooking a sauce or vegetable, a separate grain, a separate meat, and often also a dressing, plus tricksy garnishes. The instructions are often a bit muddled, too. In a few cases, he forgets to tell you what to do with, say, the radishes he's just had you prepare off in a separate side-recipe to the recipe. This is why these are not even close to 15-minute meals. 4) Okay, so, now, the very best thing I can say about this cookbook is that each recipe really does pack in a ton of nutritious ingredients. Very, very wholesome and healthy eating, for sure. Any one recipe might include two or three bunches of fresh herbs, several peppers or leeks or what-have-you vegetables, plus a whole grain, plus two or three garnishes, like preserved lemons or toasted sesame seeds. So it's super-high-nutrition, definitely . . but also pricy, pricy, pricy! Cooking to serve four, we found that each one of these dinnertime recipes cost two or three times what we usually budget for a regular supper. Some of the expense comes from needless and thoughtless waste of ingredients. We're instructed to make an (expensive) coconut milk sweet-curry sauce, and then told to put half of it in a bowl \\"for another day.\\" We're instructed to buy lemons and harissa and yogurt only to realize at the bottom of the recipe that these are simply garnish. (So, say, $9 just on the garnish for one dish. C'mon, people!) I felt almost offended, like the author is living in a la-la-land of Dean & Deluca privilege, in which he can't even be bothered to notice that he's recommending $9 worth of garnish on a family supper. To go back to Franey and Claiborne, they'd never be so spendthrift and offhand about needless ingredients and needless waste. (And their cooking was light years better!) So to put it plainly: \\"15 Minute Meals\\" is not a sustainable way to encourage people to eat better, because it's needlessly work intensive, plus it's budget-busting.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I find myself creating grocery lists, taking notes in meetings in the office, creating to-do lists for work, and at home.<br /><br />I love the &#34;checklists&#34; feature......once completed just tap on the item/task, and it shows up with a strike-through line and greys it out, showing it complete.  I also love how the user can drag each item up/down to re-prioritize, or organize it within the checklist created.  This is especially helpful for work, but also for doing things like grocery shopping.  I usually make a checklist, re-organize the items, in order which will be the most efficient so that I can pick up items based on where they are in the store (all before going to the store...as I know the &#34;layout&#34; of most things in the specific store I'm going to), and I'm able to check them off my list from top, to bottom.<br /><br />You can throw away your tired old notebook for taking notes, and creating tasks that you need to be able to check off a list, and then throw away when you're finished, and you don't have to knock down a single tree to do it!
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|Got this for my android devices, and while it works to get something down, you can not do updates to each device.. you have to come back to the pc web and do it.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson asked to download the game.  When we are waiting and bored he plays this and time flies.  I also enjoy the game however some levels frustrate me when I cannot complete.
1476712042|4.0|This book was good.  Still after reading the Twilight Saga all the books are nothing but Edward and Bella.  Thank you for your time.  Denise
B0061TQBRK|5.0|They've come quite a way as a band, and while not as goth or dark as they once were, they still have an incredible sound.  Cristina Scabbia continues as my favorite artist!  Love that voice!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I just started playing this game today and so far it's pretty good . The graphics are perfect, the controls are great! Still getting used to it but overall I think it's worth $6.99
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Very intriguing puzzles and storyline. Loved this game and wish more companies took the time to be so inventive with their games. Cannot wait til the next installment.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|I truly enjoyed Americanah.  Started out a little wordy, but as the characters developed, it gave an interesting look at what others will do to become &#34;American&#34;.  Ms. Adichie writes in a simply beautiful fashion.
B001E95ZI8|5.0|i love this film. Simple and funny. The music was decent too. Wilson did a great job too. Very talented cast.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Well imagined and executed game.  Clues and puzzles challenge but don't confound.  Hours of entertainment that merits re-playing.  You get your money's worth.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love it! Works much better than the free version,  a good alarm for the right price.  I really like it.  I need 3 more words to submit this :D LOL
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Tons of fun. I love that there are so many levels. I will be playing this game for a long time.
1451624468|5.0|This book is a well-rounded high-level presentation of the history and more recent discoveries about the size, shape, expansion and eventuality of the universe.  Above all, the vignettes of early attempts and scientific stances on these issues illustrate the tenuous, yet ever-more-learned, grasp we have on them.  Krauss is a solid writer, although quick in places - as the book's size reveals - but overall his presentation left me feeling that the theory of \\"something appearing from nothing\\" (and it's corroborating observations) are indeed a substantial and profound concept in cosmology & astrophysics.<br /> I don't take much of this book into the realm of the supernatural, and aside from clarifying his terms in the softcover preface, I've not encountered overt challenges to philosophical/religious beliefs.  Krauss is also well-known as an outspoken challenger to religions and the role of science in that discussion (Summary: Science makes no claim to the spiritual, unlike how religion typically stomps from spiritual to pseudo-science poorly).<br /> Overall, I'm fascinated by the implications of how the universe is structured after reading this book, and feel that I've learned a lot of details I wouldn't have been exposed to otherwise. (That is, as an occasional consumer of layman-level science publications).
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If you loved Firefly or simply are a fan of great script writing and colorful characters, Castle is for you.  Based on a novelist and a NYC detective, Castle is a serious, yet humor-filled romp through the rigors of odd cases.
B004S9AK7C|4.0|Ken Follett carries this story off really well ,as only he can .Not at all disappointed in this book .A very easy read with plenty of intrigue .<br />Having read a number of Follett books now ,for me they all range between 4 and 5 stars and usually based on the number of characters and twists that he introduces into the stories .Very diverse ,with characters well researched and twisting plots this is no exception and well worth the read .
0812548094|5.0|This book is so good.  Using a child to hide something of such magical importance was brilliant.  The saga of Richard and Kahlan continues with great new challenges and edge of your seat dilemmas.  The Skreeling and other nasty thingys from beyond are gruesomely cool.  The Sisters of the LIght  and the Prophet are unforgettable. If you liked Wizard's First Rule, you are ensured of a great journey as well with Stone of Tears.  Well worth reading!!
B000000HHE|5.0|Chances are, if you're looking at this product, you know what you like. Which means, YES, GET IT. If you like De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and their associates, you'll love this album. Prince Paul and Plugs 1-3 do their thing. It's a really great debut album. Great sampling, lyrics, and flows throughout.<br /><br />If you've never listened to De La Soul, or this album, it/they is/are totally worth checking out.<br /><br />Do it!
B00122MWBK|5.0|I enjoy the Goo Goo Dolss, but didn't own any of their music.  This was a great way to get their greatest hits plus a great price.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very entertaining and a real man's book. Bit like playing &#34;Modern warfare&#34; video games. Becomes a bit repetitive after a while....I mean how many head-shots can one enjoy? Also raised lots of questions for me about the US army/marines interference in other countries through military adventures and apparent lack of respect for their locals.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Can't complain...A great movie and now in 3d...what fun!  This even included the digital version of the film, great for being able to use it on my phone to entertain my nephew.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Received these headphones right before a road trip from Vegas to LA.  My first listen was through my android phone, regardless, my first impressions were \\"meh\\".  Finally got home and plugged them into my laptop and they sound a million times better!  I do not claim to be an audiophile and my primary use will be to listen while I work.  These headphones are more than I could have asked for, for the price I paid.  The sound is very rich from the Bass through the high tones.  The headphones themselves seem very well made and I love the way they compact down for travel and stow.  The cord is extra long and is spiraled in the center so the cable is not all over the place.<br /><br />Next thing is a DAC, a coworker says that with a DAC they will sound even better! (Hard to believe)<br /><br />If you are in the market for a pair of over the ear headphones for &lt; $100.00 US, believe me, just go with these you will not be disappointed!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Very good movie, a bit like the game Halo but Hollywood style. I enjoyed every minute of this film. Buy it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! It was a very good book, great twists, great plot, and never boring either
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Truly one of the best films ever made. Historically significant, everyone should see this movie regardless of how old they are or their nationality.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I think the concept of Chromecast is a great solution for those without Smart TVs. It works well and I like how I can use it with my iPad. It's downfall is the lack of services (currently only YouTube, NetFlix, and they finally added Hulu). Once they add HBO GO and other such services, it'll be a  must-have.
B00EAIMGDW|3.0|I love the game, but can't continue.  The game crashes when I try to play the last chapter in \\"The Royal Rescue\\".  I am playing on a 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  When I try to enter the level, it takes me back to the home screen for the kindle.  Can anyone help?!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful, heartbreaking, wonderful. What a heap of doing that reviews require 20 words or more and no obscenity. Hazel and Augustus would hate that.

B009ZM74F8|2.0|Somebody obviously read Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Brave New World, and probably some other dystopian novels. Somebody probably noticed that some of the dystopian movies of the time (The Matrix) have techno soundtracks and choreographed fight scenes that blend old world fighting with modern shoot 'em up weapons, so there's some of that too. But Equilibrium really never gets close to dealing with dystopian themes on the same level as any of the above. Some of my biggest gripes include the rather one-dimensional acting (though Christian Bale at times approaches two dimensions), the terrible fight choreography where the winning side's bullets hit every target but the losing side's bullets never hit anyone (even if the winning side never even ducks!), and the movie's fulfillment of so many dystopian stereotypes without actually doing anything new or novel in the genre itself. The movie is full of iconography designed to remind you of oppressive empires, from zeppelins flying overhead to Roman style lettering/engraving to an oppressive leader known as \\"Father\\". But instead of being novel or subtle, the use of imagery instead comes across as cliche and unimaginative. All in all, there are so many good alternatives in this genre that this movie really isn't worth anyone's time.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Pop music today, with some exceptions, seems largely motivated the by mantra \\"more of the same.\\" With the gradual financial takeover of the music industry from the 1970s to the present, popular music seems more and more repetitive, predictable and far less in flux. Today's pop radio songs don't sound startlingly different from those of twenty years ago, apart from the superior electronics. That mainstream musicians today might experiment, break new ground and turn the industry on its head summons up scenes of nervous executives armed with earnings graphs chanting \\"too risky! too risky!\\" Though the often over romanticized 1960s pop music scene produced plenty of bubblegum throw-aways and predictable musical motifs, it also seems to have encouraged nearly revolutionary adventurousness unlike anything seen since. Though the Beatles were by no means the only pioneers of new sounds and recording techniques, their unprecedented popularity, still not really overshadowed today in scope, makes their rejection of \\"more of the same\\" all that more amazing and poignant. Though the Parlophone \\"Help!\\" album hinted at the band's new directions, \\"Rubber Soul\\" remains the point at which things really started getting interesting. That really only two years, and numerous albums, had passed since \\"Please Please Me\\" puts their increasing sophistication in startling perspective.<br /><br />The music on \\"Rubber Soul\\" speaks for itself. It sounds little like the Beatles' previous output. More instruments, most surprisingly sitar, flow from the mix. The variety also increases. Despite encompassing disparate styles such as \\"Drive My Car,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" \\"Michelle\\" and \\"What Goes on,\\" the entire album somehow sounds incredibly uniform. Not to mention the themes. After multiple albums of love songs, the lyrics here diverge into headier territory. Though \\"Drive My Car\\" nonetheless provides the album's requisite bawdy pun, \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"The Word,\\" and \\"In My Life\\" cover more \\"grown-up\\" topics such as worthlessness, love as a universal concept and the meaning of life via friends, family and place. \\"The Word\\" provides a retrospective prequel to \\"All You Need is Love\\" and the subsequent free love connectedness culture that flourished in the late 1960s. \\"Nowhere Man\\" provides a bleak and brutal portrait of a person disconnected from the world and ambition. \\"In My Life\\" remains one of John Lennon's timeless songs about memory, change, growing up and appreciation of one's surroundings. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" gives a sideways peek into band life. Whether the vaguely related tryst ended up successful or not could probably fill hours of debate. Musically, of course, this track stands out thanks to George Harrison's then self-taught sitar playing. At the time, the pleasantly fuzzy droning accompaniment opened the gate to an entirely new musical culture. In a few years Indian culture, or perhaps an Anglicized misunderstanding or simplification of it, filled western popular culture. The song's intrigue still buzzes retroactively. Harrison started really coming into his own here with \\"Think For Yourself\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone.\\" The Beatles' next album, the even more stunning \\"Revolver,\\" would prove Harrison's song writing skills once and for all. For all of the wonderfulness \\"Rubber Soul\\" contains, it sadly ends on a slightly sour note. \\"Run For Your Life\\" approaches all out throw-away status. Though probably meant tongue-in-cheek, or as a psychotic or an \\"anti-love\\" parody song,\\" the opening line \\"I'd rather see you dead little girl than to be with another man\\" sits a little uneasily. The remainder of the song pushes this envelope, especially when the true meaning of the hook \\"that's the end-A little girl\\" sinks in. The overall tone, especially lyrically, clashes somewhat with the rest of the album.<br /><br />The Capitol label of course, as with all previous Beatles albums, also butchered this one for the American market. \\"Drive My Car\\" vanished with \\"I've Just Seena Face\\" in its place, giving this version an extremely different feel. \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" also vaporized with \\"It's Only Love\\" inserted. All of these less folky and more relatively harder rocking tracks appeared in 1966 on \\"Yesterday and Today,\\" which of course appropriately featured, initially, the infamously misunderstood, but still rather grisly, \\"butcher\\" cover. Thankfully the butchering would cease following \\"Revolver,\\" but its cutting legacy left many Americans confused when the first 1980s CD releases featured the Parlophone song lineups. Since then, these versions have faded into the background, having made profit a plenty for butchers past.<br /><br />\\"Rubber Soul\\" will doubtlessly stand as one of pop music's masterpieces. But the Beatles had not yet reached their songwriting peak, even after cranking out top notch material for five previous albums in only three years. For those who appreciate the \\"late Beatles,\\" the show had just begun and, from this perspective, \\"Rubber Soul\\" sounds more like prelude than pinnacle.a Face\\" in its place, giving this version an extremely different feel. \\"Nowhere Man,\\" \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" also vaporized with \\"It's Only Love\\" inserted.

B00BMEF6IO|4.0|After eight years of peddling an abrasive, grinding deathcore sound, Britain’s Bring Me The Horizon return with their fourth full-length in 2013’s “Sempiternal.” And upon face value, it appears BMTH have not changed much with age, as this album is comprised mainly of fiery, thrashy guitar picking, pounding drums, throaty screams, and chunky breakdowns.<br /><br />But once the surface is cracked, it becomes readily apparent that the quintet are actually now opting to sound more like a full-on metalcore band more than anything else. This influence is especially apparent in the riffs, which are now clearly indebted more to Swedish melodeath (a la At The Gates) than anything else. Also, there are a handful of melodic choruses to be had, here, as well. (And hey, they might not be, say, Killswitch Engage-worthy, but still…) And furthermore, the use of grinding blasts and deathly growls, two of the band’s standbys in past years, are now noticeably absent.<br /><br />“Sempiternal” kicks off with a creepy, and startlingly melodic intro track in the form of “Can You Feel My Heart.” But this is then followed up by “House Of Wolves,” a fiery, intense, and aggressive metalcore chugger that leaves just enough breathing room (in its choruses) to be memorable, and packs in plenty of mosh-happy breakdowns for good measure, too; and “Empire (Let Them Sing),” another blistering and mosh-intensive metallic-hardcore number.<br /><br />The rest of the album continues in a likeminded fashion to these openers, pinning just enough melodic fare against inexorable metalcore brutality. For example, consider “Sleepwalking,” a cut that might very well have more mosh pit-ready breakdowns, but is actually first and foremost centered around huge melodic choruses. This, however, is immediately offset by two other pit-stoking bruisers in “Go To Hell, For Heaven’s Sake,” which boasts another unforgettable chorus, and the blistering “Shadow Moses.”<br /><br />Also consider the fact that the band then opt to include a much slower, and more involved and textured piece in the borderline atmospheric near-ballad that is “And The Snakes Start To Sing” (which has quite a bit of accomplished clean singing) before yet again storming back in full force. “Antivist” revs up the engines once more with blistering, belligerent riffing, thrash tempo’d pacing, catchy call-and-response vocal patterns, and empowering, moshcore lyricism that is as simple as it is potent (i.e. “Middle fingers up/if you don’t give a, ahem, you know what”).<br /><br />Just to make sure we’re all on the same page, here, it needs to be noted that “Sempiternal” is not a mind-blowing effort, as it bring practically nothing new to the table, nor does it move the metalcore genre forward one iota. But overall, BMTH, who are quickly proving its status as one of the most consistent and promising groups this side of The Black Dahlia Murder, have most certainly delivered another very respectable effort, here.lso consider the fact that the band then opt to include a much slower, and more involved and textured piece in the borderline atmospheric near-ballad that is “And The Snakes Start To Sing” (which has quite a bit of accomplished clean singing) before yet again storming back in full force. “Antivist” revs up the engines once more with blistering, belligerent riffing, thrash tempo’d pacing, catchy call-and-response vocal patterns, and empowering, moshcore lyricism that is as simple as it is potent (i.e. “Middle fingers up/if you don’t give a, ahem, you know what”).<br /><br />Just to make sure we’re all on the same page, here, it needs to be noted that “Sempiternal” is not a mind-blowing effort, as it bring practically nothing new to the table, nor does it move the metalcore genre forward one iota.

B00009L1UP|5.0|Following up &#34;Operation Mindcrime,&#34; Queensryche returned with another excellent record in 1990. And even though &#34;Empire&#34; is not quite as godly as that 1988 watershed release, it is a worthy follow-up. And, if nothing else, the band did succeed at one thing: Making a album that was much easier to swallow. Stripped of superfluous fat, filler material, and convoluted story-telling, &#34;Empire&#34; is easily one  the Washington-based progressive metal outfit's finest hours. It is also much more guitar-oriented than most of the band's latter-day releases (i.e. 2009's &#34;American Soldier,&#34; which is in and by itself a fine effort).<br /><br />But before you go getting the wrong idea, bare in mind that this is still Queensryche, so all of the band's usual attributes have not gone anywhere. As such, you can expect these fourteen songs to be layered in Geoff's stellar, soaring vocals, propulsive guitar leads, dazzling, inspiring solos, and prominent, muscular bass lines. &#34;Empire&#34; is also of note from a lyrical standpoint, as it covers topics such as poverty, American politics, and social handicaps.<br /><br />The album begins with “Best I Can,” a soaring power metal anthem with some unorthodox, whammy bar/wah pedal-flavored soloing and inspiring memorable choruses. Then, following that comes “The Thin Line,” which begins as an acoustic power ballad before gradually picking up steam and heaviness with tasty, crunchy riffs and grungy-sounding bass lines. “Jet City Woman” is highlighted by a noteworthy bass intro, a soaring, stirring chorus, and deliciously shredding solo work. And then, after “Della Brown” (another laid back and restrained number with a beeping bass line, gloriously soaring guitar leads, and siren-like clean singing), and the Iron Maiden-meets-glam-metal-esque approach taken on “Another Rainy Night,” Queensryche opt to toss in the highpoints of the album. “Empire” and “Resistance” both boast wonderfully soaring (and thus instantly memorable) vocals, infectious choruses, and twiddly, technical, wailing solo flights.<br /><br />“Empire”’s second half fails to match the same level of power put up by its momentous first half, but there are still several standouts to be had. For proof of this fact, check out the way the gorgeous, vibrantly colorful acoustic guitar arrangement flows flawlessly into a jazzy melodic solo section in “Silent Lucidity.” Other recommended tracks include the up-tempo and steady metal chugger that is “One And Only,” the placid, soothing, and pretty sounding balladry (complete with baritone crooning and a militaristic drum beat) of “Scarborough Fair,” and the irresistibly catchy, falsetto vocal hooks that highlight “Dirty Lil Secret.”<br /><br />Epic yet concise and not overlong, heavy, inspired, well-crafted, flawlessly played, and seamlessly fluid, &#34;Empire&#34; captures Queensryche in all of their glory. It is the penultimate Queensryche album. And while it might not be the band's best effort, it is likely their most accessible.soaring (and thus instantly memorable) vocals, infectious choruses, and twiddly, technical, wailing solo flights.<br /><br />“Empire”’s second half fails to match the same level of power put up by its momentous first half, but there are still several standouts to be had.

B00BD07SGU|4.0|Amorphis is probably one of the best melodic death metal bands that you have not heard. Why can I make such a prestigious claim? Because they clearly have the chops and songwriting abilities to rival your favorite melodeath-heads, but it is a criminal fact that they just have never gotten the exposure that such groups as Opeth and In Flames have gotten (both of which are bands that cite Amorphis as an influence, by the way.)<br /><br />The Finland-based sextet have been showcasing their ample talents for the past twenty and some odd years, and continue to do so pretty much all throughout their eleventh effort, 2013's \\"Circle,\\" a record that takes just as many cues from the doom and gothic/black metal scenes as it does from the Gothenburg playbook (i.e. melodic and/or death metal).<br /><br />Songs like the album's opener, \\"Shades Of Gray,\\" are memorable in that they begin sounding like a triumphant, symphonic black metal anthem (a la Dimmu Borgir) before trafficking in plenty of pounding, lurching, pure doom riffage and Enslaved-style black metal croaks. Said song does open up to make room for some clean backing vocals, though, too. And later tracks, such as \\"The Wanderer,\\" also do a successful job at staggering this mix of beauty and brutality, offsetting chunky, momentously chugging power chords with subtle keyboard accents and soaring clean backing vocals.<br /><br /> \\"Narrow Path\\" begins sounding like a piece of Irish folk music, but ends on more familiar, brutal melodeath ground. But, conversely to such melodic ventures, the listener is also treated to more straight-forward and compact bludgeons in  the form of such tracks as \\"Hopeless Days,\\" which is filled with brutal, thrashy riffing, crunching power chords, and rhythmically martial-sounding drum beats. Later highlights include the positively brutal and downright monstrous death metal vocals of \\"Nightbird's Song\\"; and \\"Enchanted By The Moon,\\" which offsets this brutal, deathly bellowing/burping with some soaring clean backing vocal lines and (what sounds like) some trippy keyboard soloing. And, of course, one must not forget to also mention the set's closing piece, \\"A New Day,\\" which is a piece that, with its pretty acoustic intro, helps to cement its status as being a nicely textured and progressive epic.<br /><br />\\"Circle\\" could stand to be a touch or two heavier, and the inclusion of a couple of great guitar solos would have also been a worthy sight. But on the whole, it is a very, very solid album. And all purveyors of brutal yet oddly tuneful and melodic death metal should definitely take notice of Amorphis.ring clean backing vocal lines and (what sounds like) some trippy keyboard soloing.

B000002GK1|5.0|Soundgarden's third proper release, 1991's \\"Badmotorfinger,\\" was their commercial breakthrough and watershed release. And not only that, but it is also, alongside Alice In Chains' \\"Dirt,\\" the quintessential grunge album. With that said, though, it is important to note that calling it \\"grunge\\" would actually be a little misleading, as the record actually falls more along the lines of metallic-influenced hard rock, or alternative metal.<br /><br />The band defines what it means to fire on all cylinders all throughout this twelve song, fifty-eight-minute-long opus. Chris Cornell leads the charge with vocals that are truly top-notch, as he delivers a truly empowering and inspiring performance that engraves itself onto the listener's frontal lobe after only one listen. And he is backed up by more than ample musical propulsion, from Kim Thayil's industrial-strength guitar leads to Ben Shepherd's steady bass work, and Matt Cameron's always organic-sounding drum fills. The end result is a heavy, meaty hard rock effort from Soundgarden, a group that can seemingly do absolutely no wrong.<br /><br />The album's first couple of tracks are pretty good representations of the set as a whole -- portentous indicators as to what the rest of it is going to sound like, if you will. \\"Rusty Cage,\\" with its muscularly deep bass grumble augmented by downtuned, Sabbath-like guitar licks, and iced off by Chris' superb, wailing vocals, is a strong set opener. And \\"Outshined\\" kicks off with a heavy, sludgy, chug and churn riff and adheres to a Sabbath-y groove early on and remains there pretty much for the duration of the song. But this number's really catchy choruses and unforgettable vocal patterns are what make it prime for being a hit single.<br /><br />Next comes \\"Slaves & Bulldozers,\\" which is highlighted by an ominous bass intro and some memorable unorthodox, whammy bar-soaked guitar shredding, is another standout. But as good as this tune might be, it is almost overshadowed by what comes next: \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" is driven by surprisingly brisk, chainsaw-fast riffing and buzzing underlying bass grumbles. And all the while, Chris is heard wailing away about slavery and crucifixion. \\"Pose\\" is also of note for being performed in drop-D guitar tuning. And \\"Face Pollution,\\" then, is a suitable follow-up to \\"J.C.P.,\\" as it, too, is a blistering cut, and one that clocks in at less than only two and a half minutes in length.<br /><br />\\"Searching With My Good Eye Closed\\" boasts some more guitar soloing -- this batch being lengthier and more sustained than usual. But, again, this track is actually mostly a showcase for Mr. Cornell's stellar pipes, which sound as powerful as they do inviting, and as warm as they do wailing. And \\"Room A Thousand Years Wide\\" is another catchy chugger that is another showcase for the dude's epic, lung-stretching vocal abilities. Skipping ahead a little, \\"Drawing Flies\\" is a surprisingly brisk inclusion, and a cut that is much in the same vein as the aforementioned \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" and \\"Face Pollution.\\" It even has such a fast tempo behind it that one could argue the case for it having near speed metal-leanings.<br /><br />The record then reaches an epic conclusion when it finds Chris and Co. delivering a strong one-two punch in the form of \\"Holy Water\\" and \\"New Damage.\\" The former features some more wonderfully wailing vocals (of course!), and a catchy, staccato guitar hook, but is mostly notable for its unorthodoxly noisy, shredding guitar leads. And the latter brings back this same dissonant, whammy bar/wah-pedal worshipping solo work, with the end result sounding not unlike what you might hear on a typical noise rock release.<br /><br />So whether opting for maximum aggression or pulling back on the reigns a bit and dropping in an infectious melody, you would be hard-pressed to find a single moment of weakness in all of \\"Badmotorfinger.\\" Therefore, it is more than just a great grunge/hard rock album. It is a great album, period. Hence, it ought to be deemed as an absolutely essential listen for music connoisseurs the world over. Trust me, folks, it is Soundgarden's best and heaviest work to date, so if you only buy one record by this band, make it this one., period.

B00EVU3S4U|3.0|\\"Passion\\" is Brian De Palma's first film in about five years since \\"Redacted\\" (2007). His new film, a French-German production, is a remake of French director Alain Corneau's last film \\"Love Crime\\" (\\"Crime d'amour\\") starring Ludivine Sagnier and Kristin Scott Thomas.<br /><br />Brian De Palma's new film is, in a nutshell, a crime drama about two women played by Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander of the original Swedish \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\") and Rachel McAdams (\\"The Notebook\\"), and their distorted love-and-hate relationship. Though I enjoyed the film together with its ridiculously convoluted plot, I still don't know to what extent I should take this potboiler seriously.<br /><br />The thriller's story starts with Christine Stanford (Rachel McAdams), a manipulative advertising executive stealing an idea from her subordinate Isabelle James (Noomi Rapace). When<br /><br />To some viewers (including me), \\"Passion\\" is a vintage De Palma film, with such familiar topics as voyeurism and recorded images that were seen in his cult classics from \\"Sisters\\" to \\"Body Double\\" and \\"Dressed to Kill\\" - films with incredible characters and impossible storylines bordering on silliness, told with intensity and some intentional and unintentional hilarity. Those things you get in his latest thriller \\"Passion,\\" but the problem is, his latest film is also so predictable.<br /><br />With his signature camera works including, of course, split screen, Brian De Palma does what he does, but not always effectively. I kind of like watching the contrived settings and plot twists, no matter how outlandish they may be, but lack of tension is something different. With the atmospheric photography of José Luis Alcaine and the gorgeous music of Pino Donaggio, \\"Passion\\" looks great, but in spite of the interesting narrative gimmicks, the film feels rather empty.

There are bushes and barrels to hide in and behind. There are objects to find in each scene including a weasel that gets harder and harder to find as you progress.<br /><br />I like that the levels are not timed as I like to watch the rhythm of the guards to see where I have to go before jumping into it.<br /><br />There is a hint button but once you use it, you have to wait four hours before using it again. A unique way to handle hints!<br /><br />The tiny thief is cute and tiptoes as he gets near a guard. There are puzzle type things to figure out and you need to use some basic logic to get through. Hidden items sometimes require tapping on various parts of the scene and being observant to things in the scene that don't have an obvious purpose.<br /><br />This is nicely done and the movement (although sometimes slow) of the tiny thief is fun to watch and has some great game feel. The rest of the animation is well done, colorful and nicely rendered.

B00EKHE1JA|3.0|I'm not a figure collector, just a nerd who loves PacRim. I actually bought Striker as a part of NECA's 2-pack Striker + BD Gipsy. While I was really impressed with the level of detail on both figures, Striker was a disappointment. The first disappointment came when I discovered that the torso didn't rotate. The shoulder articulation is pretty loose - you have to lift the arms to a certain high before it'll stay in place. BD Gipsy has more points of articulation (heel and torso) and stiffer joints, making it easier to pose.<br /><br />The second disappointment came when Striker took an unfortunate 28-inch tumble off my desk and onto the floor (hard plastic mat on a carpeted surface) - the hips separated from the torso, revealing what COULD'VE...no...SHOULD'VE been a point of articulation, but was not. So not only was my unit not durable, but the two-piece construction was a missed opportunity. What's more is that I can't simply pop pieces back together. I'm sure a little glue will fix it.<br /><br />I can live with it. BD Gipsy and Striker (and hopefully Cherno Alpha and Otachi) are just meant to be nerdy desk ornaments. But I question the figure's durability if it finds the hands of a kid who is rough with his/her toys.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Elizabeth has done it again.  Her writing is that of a true professional and her research intriguing.  I am so glad to read another of her books.  Am waiting for the next.
1416955070|5.0|Bought this book not sure what to expect, haven't seen the movie and was unexpectedly drawn in to it. Could not put it down. I'll definatly read more into the series.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Pretty good, less money and more quality. i really recommend this motherboard because you can use differents proccesors chip like AMD Phenom II
B00F91RYL8|4.0|While I enjoyed the movie enough to rent it twice, I couldn't play it the second time.  It skipped in the beginning once, although not a big deal, and then froze around halfway through and then wouldn't load at all.  I restarted my computer several times and went back into the account more than once and still didn't work.  I'm very disappointed in amazon instant video.  Now there is a possibility it could be my computer but it was very frustrating.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|Best video of the band; especially because Kurt looked he was having fun! Makes you realize what trash his wife Courtney Love when you find out she gets the money that should going to their daughter, Francis Bean.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I love the game; I have played it on the ipad but every time I try to load it on fire says there isn't enough memory.
B000002UUY|5.0|This is another fantastic album by Megadeth! Dave Mustaine's vocals and guitars literally shred and the rest of the band must not be overlooked! Megadeth albums have been able to withstand the years unlike many of their counterparts! Time and time again Mustaine is able succeed with this solid method of heavy but real metal and the lyrics top it all off! The cassette rips just as hard as any CD! This is a great album to crank while cruising in your car! Checkout the trio of songs; Poison Was the Cure, Lucretia and Tornado of Souls.
B00AAQRNQ8|2.0|It tehnically is a very good mouse, I liked its software and operation, but it can't handle heavy loads and heavy use. ater only about a week or two, the side keys started to stick and stop working, so can't use it any more. I play MMORPGS, so mouses get long and hard use.
B000ICZD5M|2.0|Unfortunately, this is a very slow and dreadfully boring movie to watch. We were looking for a great old fashioned style Sci-Fi in the vein of Star Trek or other said Sci-Fi movies. Yet, Dune is weird and utterly boring. This is a nostalgic movie for those who were around when it initially came out and for those who already read the book but Dune is an overly praised counterculture Sci-Fi that just doesn't live up to the hype.
B00FDSUJ0A|5.0|I really like this album, particularly nicotine, buts  its very different from their old sound. Which doesn't surprise me too much. Every one of their albums is quite different from the last. So expect a large change in the music when listening to this.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|A pretty good player for the Amazon Kindle. Allows you to upload any movie to your Kindle and drag it to this program. The program will play any file type of movie. The only problem is you can only upload a few movies due to space issues...
B00821OX98|5.0|We love sci-fi and this is just up our alley.  If you like sci-fi, a good drama series, and aliens, you will like this series.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I am probably a-typical when it comes to how I use my iPhone (without a big bulky case), but if you are reading this review you are probably a-typical too!  I love the feel of the bare phone in my hands when I use it.  When my phone is not in use I do like to protect it, but also be able to retrieve it easily when I have a call or txt to respond to.  When you first put your phone in the case, it is snug, as it should be.  I wasn't sure how I would like the pull tab to get the phone out.  At first it was a little stiff because the case was new.  I am able to retrieve any incoming call without a problem.  I like that I can drop my phone in my bag of any kind and know that it is protected.  It is also slim enough that I can put it in my pants or jacket pocket without it feeling too bulky.  I love that there are so many colors to choose from.  I got this case in Distressed Brown and Orange.  The orange is so easy to spot when it's inside my purse, unlike the black case that I used to use for a different phone.  This product has completely satisfied my a-typical need.  Thank you Snugg for giving me such a chic option to protect my phone!
014241493X|3.0|I have always heard such positive things about John Green, so i read Looking For Alaska and thought it was okay, so decided to read Paper Towns as well hoping it would be better. Unfortunately, both lacked something, i don't know what. I just didn't like the characters, or the way he wrote, the dialogue, it was almost stupid at times mixed in with these great literary quotes and symbolism. I love writing and reading and it almost makes me cringe in the fear that my own writing would come across that mediocre. I hate saying this because i respect him as an author, so many people love his work, so i am giving A Fault In Our Stars a chance in hopes that that book is as amazing as people say. I really am being modest i wanted to give the book one star but it was generally okay the idea of \\"paper towns\\" and road trips make for a great novel, But i just couldn't connect with the characters at all and i'm a senior in high school like they were...i wanted to like this book so it makes me pretty sad, but i hope whoever reads this likes it though!
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|This is a wonderful evocation of Dylan at his most relaxed and soulful. His vocals are superb, as always, and they enfold you into them, coating you with a veneer of joy. A great hark to his past glories and some tracks are so subtle and permeating in a wonderful way.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Once again, Pearl Jam delivers! These guys never cease to amaze me with their brilliance and intensity. From hard hitting MYM to serene Future Days, this album has everything. Infallible has a tempo about it that is definitely unique compared to any other song I have ever heard from this band. Eddie's storytelling is at its best. Overall, this album is perfection. Of course, there is no reason to expect any less!
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|After what is in the letter is revealed I lost interest.<br />The characters were annoying and their situations<br />were implausible.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|This is one of those weird books that stays with you.  The characters are beautifully drawn, the wit is fabulous, the musical references sent me to the music store to hear what they heard.  Can't recommend highly enough.  Six stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My two-year-old loves this game because they have a little videos at the end and she allowed to watch these little mini cartoons of Angry Birds and it's just fabulous so thank you
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Waited a long time for his return and this was at its creepiest best. Reminded me of another supernatural fav, Dean Koontz . Long live the King!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Of course the kids enjoy it. It really helps with cognitive awareness and fine motor skills. Can't be mad at that.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Once again Google comes through.  Chromecast is a fantastic product and if you haven't used it, you are in for a great treat.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Replaces my Roku. I can't wait for more apps, but so far it has the two biggies. Clear picture, doesn't lag... Perfection.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE BOOKS...  I HAVE READ THEM AND RE-READ THEM ABOUT 3 TIMES NOW AND CAN'T GET ENOUGH!!!
1250038820|5.0|Never before have I encountered a photo-book that was such a page-turner.  When I got my copy, I opened to page one of the book, intending to just flip through a couple of pages. But I couldn't stop reading.  (&#34;Reading&#34; may not be the best word to describe this particular book).  Brandon's photography is captivating, and in so few words tells an enthralling story of the beautiful people that make up New York.<br /><br />My only criticism (not enough to bring this book down to 4 stars!) is that I wish there were more quotations from the people he photographed.  Brandon provides some of his own commentary in the captions, which is unlike the blog, and it seems kind of unnatural to me at times.  It disrupts the feeling that we are an impartial observer looking deep into the soul of the subject of the photograph.  That being said, the photography and captions are both still wonderful.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book as a gift for any New Yorker, whether or not they read the HONY blog.  It's a masterpiece!
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|This was very interesting and suspenseful. The only problem was that the picture was so dark that it was difficult to see half of the time. I understand that much of it takes place at night, but if you can't see it, how can you know what's going on?
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is a great product! I purchased this with the Amazon Kindle 9W PowerFast Adapter for Accelerated Charging  and love them!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I've heard that Caiman only tells one story, but boy can he tell it. It was slow to get into, but once I was in, I devoured it. One of those books you love to read and hate to finish.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Some levels harder than others.....challenging .....some level l s take longer to beat than others...no matter how hard a level is...you get cub h t up in beating it.  Great way to pass time
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Myself being a LONG Star Trek fan since the days of the original series, Star Trek Into Darkness was an excellent movie. The acting, special effects, and cinematography were solid in and throughout the movie. The movie sort of resembled a Star Wars flick. Special recognition to Benedict Cumberbatch for playing such a good villain. I hope to see more of the actor perhaps as a Sith Lord in the upcoming Star Wars saga.<br /><br />Though I found the movie entertaining the stories of the star trek characters such as Captain Pike, Khan, changed. Thus the writers are essentially rewriting the history and story of Star Trek in which I find it most bothersome.  What this does it takes away the original and genuine story of the Original Series in which I didn't like.<br /><br />I liked the movie overall so I gave it a 4 stars.  The rating could have been much better if were it not for the rewriting of the history of Star Trek and its characters.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Of all the games I've played this weekend (4) from this devolper, this has been the most challenging... The story line is good, the graphics are awesome &amp; the puzzles are fun to play through! I've truly enjoyed this game!!! Thanks G5 Entertainment!
B0083EY9EI|5.0|Initially, I had one favorite song... then 2, then 3 then 4 and so on and son.  Emeli Sande is extremely talented.  I can't wait to hear more from this artist.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This product shipped fast, also tech support is amazing. This product is a must have! The price is right. You will enjoy it
B0042RJWTC|5.0|The series brought to life the time of old England and the way that Kings and their courts interacted. Well done series, my wife loves it
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|I love the opening to this movie. It was magnificently done with good story telling and great special effects. I actually liked this movie the whole feel of the movie was dark and ominous the queen's storyline was fascinating, along with the childhood romance with Snow White. Then they ruined the movie, for me by making a love interest between Snow White and the Huntsman, up until that point it really felt like a father daughter bond. The hunts man could have found redemption in that fatherly role. I am not a Kristen Stewart fan, but she did ok in this movie. Charlize Theron as always was mesmerizing. I liked Mirror Mirror more, though they are completely different in mood. This is a drama more atune to the original grim fairytale, the other is a comedy for entertainment purposes, but unlike most movie adaptations Mirror Mirror did not take liberties with the foundational plot line like Snow white and the Huntsman did. Why does Hollywood believe the only defining relationships that exist between unrelated people of the opposite gender have to be romantic in nature? This movie could have been much better by sticking with the childhood romance and staying away from illogical love triangles.
0064409422|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a book that I found to be very fun to read. I thought the story was always interesting and it intrigued me from the first page to the last. I am not a big reader because I often get bored with the story line. But it was different with this book. C.S. Lewis' descriptive language helped me to imagine and picture the action and events in my head. This is important for me when I read. I want to be able to envision what is happening, and this book helped me to do that very well. Over all I would highly recommend this novel to anyone out there who is interested in becoming a part of a fantasy world called Narnia.
B00AWJYJVA|4.0|&#34;A Delicate Truth&#34; is one of the best books Le Carre has written after &#34;The Constant Gardener&#34;. It is well-plotted, fast-paced and pulls no punches describing the unholy nexus between politicians and the private defense contractors. Definitely recommended!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Having a grandson with Asperger's made me a bit wary of this book. However, Mr. Simsion was spot on with his characterization of someone with this condition. The story was quite funny without being either critical or making fun of people with this condition. It was well written, thoroughly enjoyable, and I literally could not put it down. One of the best books I've read. Well done.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is a fascinating look at how therapy works for individual patients.  It took a few episodes to get hooked but pretty soon you are really rooting for his 6 patients.  It was especially interesting to find myself really rooting for a patient who wasn't necessarily sympathetic initially.  Mia Wasikowska is a revelation as troubled 15 year old gymnast Sophie, and the married couple played by Embeth Davidtz and Josh Charles are a train wreck in action...you can't tear your eyes away!  I wanted to kick Blair Underwood out of the therapist's office myself but again, stay tuned to see if you change your mind about him!  Melissa George is the girl every woman loves to hate - stunning, calculating, and out to get her man!  Ick!  But again, not quite so easy to judge her at the end.  Diane Wiest is a the consummate actor's actor.  Quiet, smart...still waters run deep....she is a great match for Gabriel Byrne's character Paul Weston.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game!! I now there is the app for kindle and it's much better than the phone or computer.
B001H9MYPW|4.0|After getting attached to the characters in Season 1, Season 2 has a whole new set of patients.  I'm only 2 discs in and initially didn't think I'd like them as much.  But I'm starting to warm up to them, especially Oliver whose in therapy for bullying and eating issues but really it's his divorcing parents who need help!  John Mahoney is excellent as a CEO on a downward spiral, and Alison Pill is heartbreaking as a young adult patient with a secret.  Hope Davis is the most annoying patient ever - I'd give up being a therapist if she was my patient! - but each little breakthrough is revelational.  I'm really hoping she turns a corner and becomes the awesome woman we all hope she can be!
B005KA188S|5.0|Great movie and great update -actually having the original Director for the second go around.<br /><br />Also shipped wicked fast and arrived in pristine condition from the seller!<br /><br />-Could not be more pleased!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really loved playing this 'game'.  It took a lot of concentrating &amp; memorizing &amp; even deduction skills,  can not wait for updates!  Was disappointed when I finished level 10 &amp; I was finished.  :-(  Please hurry with new levels!!!!<br /><br />I<br />It
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Overall, I think Timothy Ferris provides an uncommon way to lose weight albeit if he does sound a little crazy.  Sometimes the author has a tendency to just push his thoughts onto the page without much organization.  He does provide a lot of value in one book.  Its not just a diet but a guide to your body.  However, I think everyone should heed his warning to consult a doctor.  The suggestions are not common practice and can effect your body in many ways and everyone is different.  I had migraine sized headaches to which my doctor attributed to sugar withdrawal.  He was in favor of the diet except for the cheat day (no surprise there).  My husband didn't experience any symptoms at all...<br /><br />I would appreciate more scientific evidence behind his claims.  I would definitely research all of his suggestions very well.  I also think he has a tendency to come to conclusions about medical procedures.  The medical procedures he underwent were on only one test subject - himself - whereas the diet was tested on many people.  That is where he got the material for the troubleshooting chapters of the diet.<br /><br />Diet Chapters:<br /><br />This is the easiest diet I've ever followed.  I can follow a few simple rules and have a cheat day where caution is thrown to the wind. I can eat tasty and fatty foods without calorie counting and still lose weight.  I will temper my comments with a note that it will be difficult to let go of eating refined carbs and sweets.  You may experience headaches as I did but it is almost like an addiction you've had for your entire life so you will have to have quite a bit of willpower.<br /><br />I am very surprised that the diet plan works considering that there are so few rules and no calorie counting. I have been following it for a few weeks and I have lost 10 lbs.  I am not that strict with it but I did eliminate larger portions of carbohydrates. It is amazing how eliminating one subsection of a food group (&#34;fast carbs&#34;) couldmake such a difference on weight.  It made me reexamine guidelines  on healthy eating here in America.  If you Google the food pyramid in Asian countries, you will see that it more resembles this diet with carbohydrates and fats being the smallest part of the diet and vegetables being the largest part.<br /><br />He addresses many issues with the diet in subsequent chapters.  I appreciate how he addresses common issues with weightloss on this diet even before he published the book. He goes through common issues and gives you an action plan. For example, he goes through how having multiple servings of almonds can trash your diet because of the large  I haven't had an issue that he didn't address.<br /><br />I will update the review as I attempt all chapters.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Man this game identified cool it's a little challenging especially with all of the block puzzles but that makes it that much more fun. If anyone would ask about this game I would definitely recommend it in a heart beat its a great game for many people of a lot of ages.
B000I5XOVE|4.0|I loved the series & the lines in these movies.  I have gone back to reply them just to hear a line again.  The guy who created these characters did a fantastic job. His name is Shane Black & he deserves a lot of credit for his work as a screen writer & actor director.  Thank you Shane Black.
B00FXOQO6W|4.0|Being a Marvel fan, love the show. Now we get to see the agents and learn a bit more about S.H.I.E.L.D. The story line seems to be picking up more and more into each episode. Let's just hope this is not a 1 season thing.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy Kindle finally has candy crush! I love this game! Great graphics, challenging and addictive. Definitely recommend for all ages.
0321543726|5.0|The book is very useful, especially for beginners like me. I began to read this book from beginning and worked most of the exercises. It really improves the ability of programming, if you meet the rules of this book.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Didn't really know about it until I downloaded it.Gr8 game never played an addictive as such,keep up the good work and keeping it free IS good too&lt;3
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved this app<br />it is the most coolest app i ever got forever so others out there I loved this app
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Totally plausible and interesting on each page.<br />Grisham has a way of making a story easy to follow but hard to put down.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|seriously they never make bad music! there are songs that i don't like as much as others but there are never any that i dislike. great album
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I'm a big fan of Del Toro's work. So when I heard about Pacific Rim I put aside any comparisons to Godzilla movies or Transformers movies and just went for it!  I'm glad I did.  This film with its premise of alien monsters from the deep devastating planet  Earth, and the inhabitants of Earth building huge robots to fight the denizens of the deep, was pure cinematic, popcorn-chomping, get-ready-to-be-blown-away fun!  Del Toro has always dreamed big.  His films bring me back to my childhood when I approached a movie just for its entertainment qualities and didn't spend time picking it apart.  Pacific Rim, although the subject matter of saving Earth is very serious, doesn't take itself too seriously.  There are very amusing scenes, especially with Ron Perlman whose character is over-the-top but I loved him.  Hint: Don't turn off the film until after the credits have run.  All of the actors were great in their roles, but I just have to say one thing about Idris Elba.  The man has so much talent and screen presence.  Del Toro was a genius for casting him.  One more thing: My husband is highly critical of science fiction films and even he loved it.
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|This is a great album to play loud with the windows rolled down and a tall boy in your lap.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The first 2 book definately need to be read one behind the other so you get a smooth story line going.  The third book, however, does not pick up where the second one left off.  It actually takes place months down the road.  The opening few chapters were a bit confusing.  They flip-flop from past to present and back again.  Whenever I was interupted, I had to remeber where my place was: past or present.  But, once you get past the first few chapters, the flip-flopping stops and we remain in the present.<br /><br />There seems to be less sex scenes in this final book.  (Oh, don't get me wrong, there are sex scenes in the book, just less of them.)  We seem to concetrate more on the task of making the relationship work and less on the sex.  We have kidnapping and attempted murder in this book, so the action picks up a bit.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!<br />I think what Ana calls her unborn child is cute.  &#34;Little Blip.&#34;  I've never heard this term used before, this is a first.  I think this is a nice, wonderful, orginal, idea of what to call an unborn child.  Cute and unique.  However, Christian's reaction was totally uncalled for.  If he were real, I'd go over to him and smack him accross the face, hard limit or not!
B00A2H9WW8|3.0|I suspect those of you who haven’t seen the original 1976 movie version of Carrie will like this movie more than those who have. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carrie, a young girl who has led a sheltered life. Her religious fanatic mother hasn’t even told her about her periods. After gym glass, when she has her first period ever while taking a shower, the other girls make fun of her and toss tampons at her. When the ringleader of this chaos, played by Portia Doubleday, is banned from her prom, she vows to make Carrie pay. She doesn’t know that Carrie has telekinetic powers which will intensify after her first period.<br /><br />Moretz is good but Sissy Spacek in the original was great. You believed that she really could be an extremely shy girl who just doesn’t fit in with her contemporaries. Julianne More is good but Piper Laurie in the original was great. You believed she really was a religious fanatic. Doubleday is not as convincing a villainess as Nancy Allen was in the original. And John Travolta as her airhead boyfriend in the original seemed more like a real person than Alex Russell.<br /><br />The actors might have done better if they had been given a better script. Unlike the 1976 movie, the 2013 script favors special effects over character development. Moretz’s character has the power to tear up highways. In the 1976 movie, special effects were kept to a merciful minimum.<br /><br />Carrie is based on Stephen King’s first novel. According to King, the movie (1976 version) made him what he is today, one of the bestselling authors in the world. I think the movie (1976 version) was better than the novel, although I know some King fans who disagree with me. One person who does agree with me is Stephen King himself who, in Danse Macabre, described his book as having “a certain heaviness a really good popular novel should not have.” He further states that his book lacks the style of the 1976 film. I don’t think he would be that impressed with the 2013 version.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|&#34;The Best MEN IN BLACK Yet!&#34; Shawn Edwards, FOX-TV &#60;-- written on cover of DVD case<br /><br />WARNING!  SPOILER ALERT!!!  The above statement needs to change Best to Worst.  The first one is still the best one yet.  One thing that I did thing was strange was the look of MIB headquarters.  We open up in the present and MIB HQ has a new look.  Way different from the look in the first movie.  (By the way, I still miss the twins!)  Yet, when we go back to the past, MIB HQ still has the look from the present scenes.  Should it not look more like it did in the first MIB movie?  And there aren't too many aliens!  I mean, come on!  An Alien movie with more emphasise on time travel instead of the aliens?  And where is Frank?  I must have seen a dozen pics of a pug dog and no Frank?  Where's Frank?  And the worms!  I miss them too!  They had such a small part this time around.  I hope that they stop it here before they make it worse.  If they come out with a MIB 4, they need to get the people who did MIB 1 back so it can be good!<br /><br />All in all, if you want to purchase this movie, buy it cheap.  It ain't worth more than that.
B009NQX48C|5.0|Whalberg is riveting as practically perfect boyfriend hiding an insane jealous streak. It leads to terror and a surprise ending.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!<br /><br />I've watched the original Star Trek movies (not the series, just the movies).  I never did get into the next generations bit.  I liked James T Kirk and his crew.  Anyway, I just watched this flick last night for the first time and I must say, &#34;The Wrath of Kahn&#34; fits it to a T!  So, I was expecting Spock to enter a closed area and die and then (maybe) come back to life in part 3.  The movie did not disappoint.  Someone important did die.  I wonder what the third movie will be about.  Are they gonna search for any missing crewmates?  And here I was, under the assumption that they were NOT gonna repeat the original movies.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie (without comparing it to the original movies) is excellent!  A must watch for anyone who enjoy the first Star Trek movie.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing!!  Great sound effects and visuals.  Successful sequel to the first movie that was just as amazing.
B002G4FQI4|5.0|GB's collection of songs is the absolute best, quintessential GB.  His Songs & Stories are featured prominently in my playlist.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked how Stephen King went back to the Shining and continued with Danny.<br />You know he couldn't let it end there.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Well, I thought this was a pretty decent effort. Many reviews focused on a couple of key points: Krypton was more interesting than in the older films. The actors were good esp. Cavill and Shannon and Crowe. Adams was better than the previous Lois Lanes but none of them can compare to Phyllis Coates in the first season of Adventures of Superman: she nailed Lois for all time, not only the character but the looks as well. I agree with those who complained about the duration of the battle scene; the destruction became unimaginative and repetitive. The main virtue of this rendition was the restoration of Superman's tougher persona. Look at the stories from the original comics of the late 30s and 40s and you'll see a Superman who roughed up bad guys and used fear convincingly to get confessions and information. In the first season of Adventures, George Reeves played him as a very tough character and the noirish plots framed that portrayal very well. Only after the first season, at the behest of sponsors and networks was the show turned into a children's show and Superman into a boy scout. And that became the mold for Superman for over 50 years until now. Superman has to be potentially dangerous at all times and he has to learn to be self sacrificing or the stories will just fall back into the same rut.  The climax of this film will surely give the writers a basis for Kal-el to become the Christ-like figure we want him to be. But that should be his struggle, not a given. And for those who have never seen George Reeves in  the role, give it a shot esp. Season 1 of Adventures.
1416550518|5.0|Wonderfully written book; it kept my attention and gave us a peak at a different way of life from now.
B00FHSQKZ4|5.0|It works beautiful and really motivates when it goes off.  so far it is essential to keeping  plan and much better than just a beep!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|Lots of gaps in the plot and technical inconsistencies in the basic premises of the film. If you can get past that its still pretty bad. I just feel that Jaden Smith cannot act. Next to his father that is even more apparent.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|the sound and melody choices are great, the use is easy, and the colors of the icon are easy to find!
0810979772|5.0|It is a great diary! My 7 year old kid loces to read and now he is enjoying writing every day
B005LAIGTG|5.0|This movie is very well done.  Similar to other movies in the genre, but still enjoyable on its own.  It reminds me of movies like the Notebook (although this story is NOT written by Nicholas Sparks despite similar cover art to all of his movies.).
B007704PRU|5.0|I loved this so so much, it was so incredible and to imagine a world where love is a disease and everyone wants to rid themselves of it is almost torture, but to see how much love matters (even in a fictional story) is incredibly moving and eye opening
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love the app but its been connecting to facebook for 10 minutes and still hasn't connected,but it is fun.
B00AQLGXTU|5.0|I am absolutely in love with the prince! I need to know what happens ASAP as this all these ideas are runnning through my mind and I finished this book over a month ago.<br />Cant get it out of my head
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally letting us get this on the kindle. I've waited so long for this. You have made me the happiest person in the world.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|very useful and simple application easy to use a very viable alternative I personally am comfortable whit this application, i recommend it to all
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Haven't watched these episodes on my Amazon Prime as yet. Have already seen episodes, so I know how great they are.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Katniss is trying to save her sister Prim who might be picked for the reaping. But her name has only been in once sence her name has only been in once. But she is chosen and Katniss volunteers to take her place to fight to the death. Then a boy named Peeta is chosen and she remembers him from somewhere. So they fight to the death with 24 other tributes and they end up winning!!
0786939532|5.0|I read other books in the series before this one so I missed out on the start up this book offers but even without that the book holds your attention with the detail he puts into the book and gives you a true look at the main character's background to get you hooked on this series right off the gate.
B007SGM084|5.0|I CHOSE THIS BOOK I BECAUSE A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES suggested it be added to my reading list. The book started off slow and quite dull but after the photo shoot things really took off and I could not put this book down until the very first nd. I loved how much class this book had even though the content was provocative. The language truly reflects the character of the author!  These books also extended MY vocabulary, which is the purpose for reading. Finally I loved how unpredictable each scenario was and after reading more about Christian Grey it certainly put everything into perspective. I look forward to reading more books by E L James. You are an magnificent genius!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I completed  this book with the knowledge that the  great Tom Clancy had recently passed and although I am looking forward to his final book it is with great sadness. This  man was not only a great author but a grade A historian as well. I wonder who will attempt to take his place, not that his place could ever be filled, but who will carry the torch now? Who knows? Maybe me???
B0012GMUMC|5.0|This group can rock hard, perform flawless love songs and even delve into disco sounding completely believable on all formats. The real confessional piece here is the unreleased &#34;Out of Love&#34; which featured their new (at the time) vocalist Byron. If he's not pouring his heart out and meaning every word, he's the best actor ever! Sadly, &#34;Waiting for your Love&#34; and &#34;Without your love&#34; are missing from this, although they're both available on the video version. The former was a masterpiece for Bobby Kimball who has more soul in his pinky than these fake artists of today have on their whole discography. The latter was ahead of it's time and proved that this group had an understanding of music as a science.
B00000AF98|5.0|Not a huge Kiss fan, but big enough to buy the albums that I like. Back in the day of cassette tapes, this was in my collection and finally updated everything I had into compact disk. To each his own, but I feel that this is one of their under-rated albums....with or without make-up!
B00BMR4RIG|5.0|This app is surprisingly amazing it works very well on my kindle fire 7in and this app is just all out great!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Most people don't need this device.  If you have a Smart TV, DVD Player, A/V receiver.......then you don\\"t need this.  ALL \\"Smart\\" devices connect to your WI=FI and do all this already, (That is what \\"Smart\\" means)  so why do you need another device that does what you can already do?  Worthless.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Time killer a lot of fun keeps u busy keep up the good work can't wait to see what other games u guys have
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This was a great read.  The data provided was intriguing and informative.  It's interesting to know how the mind works and how companies today use our habits for their gain.  This will be a Christmas present to many this year.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It is a good story line. But there are parts that are too slow. It lost my interest a few times, but then it picks back up. All and all, a good book
B000NY17J6|5.0|Love this cd.  Linda is my all time favorite singer.  Every song is great.  She is an icon and I am having so much fun listening to her.  What a voice!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|An amazing device and for only $35.  I know we will get a lot of pleasure watching movies, etc. and bringing them into our home.  I highly recommend Google Chromecast!
B00023BLXK|5.0|just what I ordered.  Enjoy watching the movie and will have for a long time.  thanks.  Amazon - shorten how long feedback should be then maybe you will get more.
0425263991|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is the best book in this wonderful series by Nalini Singh.  The series is interesting on several levels - one is the futuristic world where subgroups of the 'human' species live together - the changelings, psy & the regular humans.  (Of course if you are reading this book, odds are you have read at least one of the 14 books in the series that preceded it.)  Another interesting aspect of these books is the continuation of the storyline - Ms. Singh keeps it moving forward with each book in a rational manner, tying different characters together as she goes.  Another interesting aspect is, of course, the romances that she has written in each book with compelling characters, logical relationship developments and yes, the sex/physical component.  She has it all covered.<br /><br />I have been a fan of this series since the beginning and although I have enjoyed each of them, some of them lean toward more romance with a backdrop of the rest of the world and some of them are more balanced in the relationship/worldview story - this book falls into the latter category.  Some past reviews of this series thought it would end once Hawk & Sienna got together and the big battle conspired, but alas, Ms. Singh continues to weave her story (and her couples) with continued finesse.  This series ranks high in my personal book preferences.<br /><br />Heart of Obsidian follows Kaleb Krycheck, whom comes across as likeable even though he doesn't have any empathy for anyone except Sahara.  I like how this story starts with her rescue and we see the past through both of their viewpoints (and see how they met & what events transpired in the past) as their new relationship moves forward.  Sahara never took to Silence (Kaleb helped her hide it), but Kaleb had a much more difficult path in his early development and is cold, calculating, and ruthless.  He is also the most powerful man on the planet - it's good that he has Sahara as his conscience since his was never allowed to develop.<br /><br />Pure Psy are trying to put the Psy at the top of the foodchain, where they belong.  The humans should be their trusted servants whom the Psy have an obligation to care for.  Henry died a couple of books ago so there is a new intelligent guy who is leading the new charges.  There are events that are set up to prove the superiority of the Psy populace.  Casualties are expected, but the strong will survive.  It's an interesting premise that again, flows well with the rest of the series.<br /><br />I'll end my quite simplified review here because if you are reading reviews of this book, you just need to read the actual book.  It is 360 pages and there are all kinds of other tie-ins including the arrows, changelings, previous counselors, psy net, etc.  Just do it- you won't regret it.
0596522347|5.0|A must read regardless of your profession. Great short concise chapters, and a good reference to have at your desk.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm already addicted to this game. So glad it is now available for the kindle fire. Now I don't have to just wait to play it on Facebook. I can link my Facebook candy crush saga account to my kindle woo hoo lol you will really enjoy this game :)<br />Now if Amazon would just add the pet saga rescue game I will be a happy camper lol
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|This is an awesome movie and the blue ray is phenomenal. I love Leo Dicaprio. I've watched it a hundred times already!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I love it, great game! Never know what's going to take place or how good your going to do! Five stars for sure!
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This is a prime example of a 'Daddy is a famous actor and can buy me any role I want' type of movie. Here is the honest truth:<br /><br />Jayden Smith cannot act.<br /><br />He has absolutely no discernible talent; not even a crumb. Watching him on screen is torture. The Karate Kid was bad enough, but he was so young, I decided to give him another shot. Bad choice. Will Smith had to dumb down his acting 'skills' to make his kid look 'good', but in doing so, he created one of the most boring, one-note, totally contrived characters that has ever graced the silver screen. Whatever happened to the Fresh Prince? Now he's old news.<br /><br />Here's a word of advice to Will: Be honest to your damn kid...tell him he sucks, and maybe he can find something that he is actually good at. You filled that kid's head up with nonsense, and now he's an unstoppable juggernaut: churning crap movies out at lightning speed.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />I'm not even going to touch on the stupid pseudo-science in the movie because I will go on forever.<br /><br />DO NOT PAY MONEY TO WATCH THIS. After all, you'll just be supporting the weirdo devotees of L. Ron Hubbard's made-up 'religion'. Why, Will? WHY DID YOU TURN TO SCIENTOLOGY?? Everything you've made after that thorough brainwashing has been total S***!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how they made a game about my favorite movie! Everyone loves the minions! The game is awesome, and the goals aren't impossible for you to do.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|We Love this Movie. There is lots of Great Action....Great Acting by Great Actors.  It is loaded with &#34;the good stuff&#34; according to the men in the family.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I have not stopped listening to New since it arrived in my hands last week.<br />I had been to a listening party in NYC and heard it the first time in full then, a week before the release date.  Nothing beats having the cd in hand and listening to it full blast with a big set of headphones on.<br />Normally I like most of Paul's past releases but not every song.  With New every song is a gem in some way, from the incredible acoustic guitar work, to the lush production and amazing vocals.<br />I really can't even pick a favorite song because every time I listen I fall in love with a different one.  Early Days had me in tears - Like Here Today, a beautiful tribute to John and the beginnings of their partnership.  New is so fresh and upbeat and the end is very Beatlesque.  And Alligator - just love the sounds<br />I truly think this is really one of his best efforts in a long time.  I can't wait for the next one.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Very good read. I should have read this long ago. It was wonderful and very poetic. I recommend this book.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Hard to beat for the price. Has done everything it promised. Easy to use and fairly easy to set up.
B0001LJCMK|1.0|i bought this because i heard a song in a movie. but after further listening and reading i realized there is alot of anti -god lyrics on the whole c.d !!! i trashed it imediately
B001EC2ISA|5.0|After an accident, a dead couple is forced within the confines of their home - sort of stuck between death and the eternal afterlife. When an eccentric family moves into and completely renovates their deeply cherished home, they call upon Beetlejuice to assist them in scaring the family out - however- Beetlejuice has his own agenda! This is a classic spooky movie that I have adored for many, many years. If you don't like Alec Baldwin or Michael Keaton - probably skip this one. I enjoy both actors very much, as well as, all of the other very famous faces that play roles in this movie. This is a funny movie with enough spookiness to satisfy a Halloween inspired movie night. I'm excited to add it to my DVD collection!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Pretty simple and easy to use.  would love to see more apps as developers jump on board.  Yet another quality product from Google.<br />Thanks guys!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Purchased this one for my 3.5yr old and before the end of the movie, he was in my kitchen with makeshift Ghostbuster gear asking me, &#34;Momma- got any ghost-uhs in here?&#34; It's on HIGH rotation in my home!! It's inspired a Ghostbuster game-a mix of hide and go seek and tag- were we take turns being the hunted ghost and falling to the floor to be sucked up into his pretend trap ( an old large digital camera with wrist strap)  I have nothing to remark on about this movie since it was such a GIANT hit - I think it speaks for itself!!
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|I like Billie Piper otherwise the season is sort of a wash... horrible everything, but if you are into corny sci-fi then go for it
B00FPH6AXE|5.0|I thought this movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time 5 stars to each actor and the whole production of this movie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, helps to take your mind off other things ,great way to pass the time , and it makes me happy I can now play it on my Kindle..
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Has anyone else found an error with connecting to the server.  It won't let me open it and says the servers are down every time.  I would love to play this.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game and the updates that the minions get help keep the game alive. Each time a new update comes it makes the game  more interesting. I guarantee you'll have a lot of fun with this game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I downloaded this on a whim for a road trip and am so happy I did. It is so well written that you forget you are even reading, it just flows through you. I will say you know what is coming, but like an oncoming train, you can't stop it and it doesn't hurt any less. Do yourself a favor and read it immediately.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Very good. Tho I did like Season l the best, this is an excellent and if you watch Season l you HAVE to continue with Season 2!
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Unfortunately the movie was unable to be viewed and would not download. Unable to receive credit for purchase_-paid for nothing-very disappointing trying to view while traveling.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|A fun book with many twists and turns. The layout and incidents make this novel very believable. Plenty to make one think.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game. My wife got me addicted to it on the Android. Glad it is finally available for the Kindle through Amazon.
6305265666|5.0|I love Cinderella/Romance stories and this one is one of my absolute favorites.  The CD came new and no defects.  I watch it every few weeks or if I've seen something on TV particularly gruesome or scary.  If I watch this before I go to bed I forget about the unsettling one and go to bed happy.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|Spent Sunday (yesterday) watching Disc one and two.  Broke three when I attempted to remove it from the package.  Could I buy just<br />three, so I can complete our set?
B005S9EJ14|5.0|With the wonderful sense of humor that only the Brits can produce, this movie will touch your heart!  Judy Dench is pure sunshine and Maggie Smith is wonderful!
B000001DQG|3.0|Following up his double album Goodbye yellow brick Road, probably his masterpiece, isn't easy. Caribou isn't a terrible record, but it's clear something is missing. There's good stuff here, espesially \\"Don't let the sun go down on me\\", one of his classics. The other single, The Bitch is Back, is fun and uptempo but don't have quite the melodic spark of his previous singles. The album closer, Ticking, is a long character sketch, one of the more interesting songs here. There's a country ditty, Dixie Lily, and \\"Solar Prestige\\" with nonsense lyrics that might be fun but hardly a great song. But several songs here sound half-baked, repetitive or just not developed much. The performances are certainly competent, but the band is reported to have been tired because of the prolonged touring, and it shows: most of the songs lack spark and vitality compared to his previous records. With the exception of a few tracks I feel this is a mediocre record. Most people will be better off with most of his other 1970-75 releases, or the double Greatest Hits (includes the singles from this album).
B005LAJ212|5.0|Having struggled with frequent advertisements and interruptions in this ongoing story while watching the TV series, it was so much more enjoyable to continue with the plot, which is complex, without interruption!
B007SSDI2E|4.0|Meg has become such a negative image in movies lately that I didn't want to watch this.  Although she is just ok in this movie, I thought it was cute and the other stars made it shine.  My 16 year old daughter loved it, I liked it. Nice to watch a movie without bad language or sex scenes.
B009RX8MQ0|4.0|Having missed much of the First Season when presented on tv, the opportunity to catch up on the sequential story plot into the second season was so much more intriguing.
B00CHVJ4SO|5.0|ok then The Croods is one of the coolest movies ever made great picture amazing creatures even the characters are funny my whole family enjoyed it very much thank you DreamWorks!
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This is a wonderful story of great talent rejuvenated within the confines of a beautiful retirement home--full of humor with a wonderful twist at the end.
B00AB65SP0|3.0|It's still entertaining to watch, but far as funny as the first ones.<br />Seems like the ideas dried out.<br />Won't buy the next season.
B00BEIYM42|5.0|As always, the actors bring this touching story to life--reaching the tender heart in each of us.  The dichotomy of the young and the elderly come together to produce a smile.
006178480X|5.0|Have read the whole series of Sigma Force novels.  They are all spellbound novels.  He is an exceptional writer.  Can't wait for the next book in the series to come  out.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Good book kept pages turning. Only complaint is no real ending or answers - just have to keep moving through whole trilogy... Very entertaining though.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Drew is an ass, but I love him! This book made me laugh and it was kinda cool getting an insight on how men think. Loved it, would definitely recommend others to read it.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Takes forever to load up on my tablet, but very readable once I finally get it there. I am still exploring all the things it can do
0440217563|2.0|The book I received was a very small papeback edition with tiny  print. Not as pictured here. Good book, but I don't like the format I was sent at all.
1848507836|4.0|I was interested in reading this book by Anita Moorjani after watching an interview where she narrated her experiences and answered questions the host and a few viewers had for her. The first aspect that drew me to her, other than the curiosity I naturally have for esoteric and spiritual experiences was her honesty and simplistic way in which she expressed herself. The book reflects this  feeling in the way she easily talks about her childhood tribulations and what shaped her personality. At times I found some parts repetitive, but on the whole it did make me think how I could evolve into a better person- one that I am actually proud of being! I liked the non preachy approach, although it's hard to entirely escape that when one has had an experience (an NDE) such as this!
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|I've been waiting for this movie to come out and watched it last night. It surely has brought out the haters and trolls in the media and review sites, so everyone is piling on the hate and spite, which I find disgusting behaviour.<br /><br />No, its not a great movie, but it was good and I enjoyed it. If Will committed any sin, it was loving his son like any parent would and giving him a hand up because he CAN. Most of us would do the same thing in his situation. It was NOT a terrible movie. No, it wasn't a stunning scifi production either, though the art direction was really great. Will made one mistake, and that was writing the movie himself. I'm 64 and have seen alot of stars become really successful and make the mistake of thinking if they get worldy acclaim for their acting, this qualifies them to write their own material. Very few ever successfully pull this idea off, and the plot in this flick just wasn't very dimensional.<br /><br />I can tell that Will believes in the idea of you \\"create your own reality.\\" The key thing I took away from this movie was the statement that \\"fear is not real, most of us living in fear of ideas and events that almost never happen.\\" This is an important idea and was well stated in the story. But Will's 2nd mistake, is that while yes you do create your own reality, you cannot create a reality for someone else, and this is what almost every parent tries to do; it didn't work on me or anyone I know. You can't buy talent for your son, you can't buy movie stardom for your kid, no matter how much you love him. Take away Will and where would Jaden be? Jaden will eventually rebel and find his own path, I'm sure.  The movie? It was worth watching, was entertaining, I enjoyed it, its no classic, but its not as bad as the big mouth critics are saying it is. Get it, watch it, decide for youself and ignore the haters.....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game and locations please let ny be next and running through all borough . Western locations would be nice to send
B003G4W49C|5.0|The title is quite an interesting choice given the story that unfolds. This book is an easy read and is quite entertaining. I read through it in a matter of days so I would have it done before the movie came out. It was good enough that I have now ordered the rest of the series and I am going through all of the books.<br /><br />If you like a Sci-Fi Action-packed political and sometimes philosophical experience then this is the book for you.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is amazing! I was waiting so long. Thank God Candy  crush I  finally here. I thought this app was only available in the Apple and Google play store I guess not!!!!!!!!!
B000XUBFE2|1.0|I could not get into this book. I had to stop reading it. As a rule, I stick with a book once I decide to start it. Sadly, I had to make an exception with this one.<br />The author seems to go out of his way to dazzle readers with his failed attempt of symbolism regarding colors and flat lined characters.<br />Reading this book was difficult on many different levels. For one, the synopsis written on Amazon, tells us thst the story is about a girl , her visit to Germany, an accordianist and an untimely war. This led me to believe that I was going to be reading a touching story that had heart and longing. Mans inhumanity toward man etc. Instead, I became baffled with nonsense to the point of putting the book down, and trying to clear my mind of all the \\"clutter\\".
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|If you are over 40 you will appreciate this set!!  Lego did an amazing job on it!!<br />Marty McFly is adorable!
034553056X|3.0|I hadn't read Grisham in a long time.  The last book of his that I read seemed to be written on a 4th grade level and i could not finish it; just too boring.  I enjoyed this one, though it was predictable. I listened to the book on CD and that makes a big difference.  However I  thought Grisham was going to tie in the rich old lady he introduces at the beginning of the book -- he spends a lot of time developing her character -- but no, it was just a page-filler. I recommend the book as a good way to get thru a tough commute -- listen to the audio.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game makes me laugh.  Hate that the high scores are bogus because of hackers.<br />Looking forward to more levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love how this story stayed real to the reality of cancer. There was pain, there was joy in the story, just like life. Green has a gift for language and conveying the feelings of his characters.
B00E326L3G|5.0|I  read the book when it was first published Singer and Senor did an admirable job in describing Israel start up support and its results. It is fascinating. I found it hard to put down. I recommend it highly to fried and foe.<br /><br />However I revert that my latest attempt in purchasing the book was not successful. It was sent to the wrong person and address and I still waiting.<br /><br />Jerry Lapides Ph.D.
B008Q00PHY|5.0|Cool techno soundtrack, John Travolta, guns, chicks, cheesy dialogue. Looks and sounds spectacular, too. Popcorn, Twizzlers, beer, play movie, spectacular.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|I think it could be alittle longer movie. I keep thinking about the lord and the ring . this movie should have come out before the lord and the ring.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I own every Star Trek movie and most of the various series, all on DVD. I therefore did not care for the 1st \\"Star Trek\\" movie done by these people. My sister and I don't like the way they've changed the history of the show/characters that have been in place for decades. My brother told us to watch it as a brand new movie, disconnect it from what we've known in the past. So we re-watched the 1st one when the second one came out and we were then able to enjoy them too. They are very good and very entertaining. We're very happy they're at least keeping to their original personalities though.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great graphics and animations. Not so great story line, just what you would expect from a hero's movie. Really predictable.
B000FA6720|5.0|I always heard about the movie. I wanted to read the book and soooo glad I did. Beautiful love story. Loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is amazingly simple to use and it streams high quality videos very well. I had it up and running in about 5 minutes, including downloading the app to my phone and laptop. I use it a lot to view videos of live music and other YouTube content. Depending on how it was recorded, the audio and the video are excellent (if the source is bad, playback is no better). Using my phone as a remote to queue up videos is very convenient. Chromecast does not interfere with other uses of the phone.  It works great with Netflix. It would be a 5 star but the breadth content is pretty limited at this moment (It would, for example, be great if there was Amazon Prime available). I understand that Google is working to expand the available content.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wow what a story ! Loved loved loved.  My heart soared with  Louisa and than broke for her. Such heartfelt emotions. And in the end it all make sense.
B002O6FBW0|2.0|Sorry, I did not realize it was a silent film, I would not have picked it to watch. Soon as it started and I realized it was silent I turned it off.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This little gadget has had a lot of praise and I will add mine to it. It's small and powerful.  I haven't had success in getting Amazon movies to work with chromecast but am hopeful Amazon will coordinate with them to make it work
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It's a thrilling account of which most conspiracy theorists would hope to see more often.  Quite interesting reading for anyone.
B004SIPAJG|5.0|This is my all time favorite dance movie. Viewing it always helps me feel better. It is amazingly fast paced and easy to follow all at the same time. It is a wonderful mix of storytelling and dance all in one. I got this for my birthday and it was great to have the DVD with the story behind the making of it. This movie made me a fan of the director and I have enjoyed all his subsequent movies as well.

0061150142|5.0|it was one of the best books I've ever read. I highly recommend it. I am starting to read another Jodi Picoult book now. I love her books.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next season. Finally a really good historical drama with out ten minutes of pointless sex scenes in every episode. It was so good I watched it all in one day. I hope this series goes on for years!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Loved this book. Everyone needs to read this book already 5 times!! I also bought the documentary and it is good as well but left out some good tips
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|Just when I thought Nicholas Cage couldn't stoop any lower he does a movie like this.  Poor script, average plot, and average characters make this animated movie passable at best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting. I can't stop playing it. This game is awesome and you should download it.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is a fun hair styling game. You get to dye cut and wash the hair.It also has 6 diffrent character.I love Toca Boca apps.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|A cute game. Very easy to play, but the difficulty does ramp up. Much like Diner Dash but the Hello Kitty characters are a plus.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|5 stars for the book, -1 stars for the Audio version.<br /><br />The Audible Audio version of this book BLEEPS the bad words. Apparently Random house has decided that readers of this book are sensitive small children who must not hear those bad, bad words the author uses. The loud, obnoxious BEEP-BEEP-BEEPINING of the bad words completely ruins the audio book<br /><br />I don't know what Random House was thinking.  Even if they insisted on removing the bad words, they could have just silenced them (that would have been bad enough). But instead of silencing them, they play a LOUD, OBNOXIOUS BEEEEEEEEEEEEP for every F-word the author uses. The BEEP is about twice as loud as the narration. If I were Taleb I would sue Random House.<br /><br />So if you like to fall asleep to audio books, this one will wake you up about every 5 minutes with a loud, obnoxious BEEEP-BEEP-BEEEP alarm.<br /><br />Epic fail, Random House.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Simply put it does not even begin to work as stated it freezes up not worth the time or effort
0156034026|5.0|Great book and great service getting it to me.  It was a book club suggestion and I have enjoyed the writer.  Would recommend the book but AMAZON service was awesome!
B00BWQW73E|4.0|I was familiar with Amazon having been in academic publishing and sold to them from the very beginning. Amazon opened up a whole new market for scholarly books - selling to interested individuals rather than mainly to libraries.  I am an frequent purchaser and an early adopter of the kindle.  I didn't know the full story of the day to day workings over the years and this was a fascinating book - detailing the beginning of company to the present.  However, I knew little about founder Jeff Bezos other than his public persona. All I can say to The Washington Post staff -- be afraid, be very afraid.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James Altucher is an inspiration. He lays out his failures with honesty (and a good dose of humor) and shows how he has overcome them. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to improve his/her life. If you haven't already, take a moment to sign up for his emails. What a joy to open my emails and find another of his posts!
B00E0SX118|5.0|I was curious about this movie, but skeptical. I had heard it was good, but, given the title, was concerned that it might have humor I would find ... well .. seventh-grade. Wow, was I wrong. This movie was really great! The story was clever, the imagery was interesting, the music was good, and the characters were actually developed in realistic ways. Even the secondary characters weren't forgotten. The humor varied from slapstick to subtle. The pace was good, and the action varied from tense to humorous. It actually made me tear up at one point - which is unusual. Well done, DreamWorks! Another keeper!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app because it makes it possible to always have the word with me, I just wish more features were available for offline access. I like taking notes but when I'm not in a place where I have network access, I am unable to take notes using this app.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I alternatively love and then hate Martin.  Love him for creating the world of Westeros and all its inhabitants...and then loathe him for killing off characters who he has made me admire and love.  If you enjoy multi-generational sagas with richly imagined and developed worlds, heroes and villains then put this series on your must read list.  Very highly recommended!  p.s.  HBO has done a pretty phenomenal job turning it into a mini-series as well!
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headset takes 1-3 hours to charge depending on how much of a charge is left and lasts 10 hours as advertised.  I've been listening to music on my set for a day and just now plugged them in with \\"3 hours remaining\\" according to the software.  I have Windows 8 x64 and these work great with that OS.<br /><br />The only thing that could be better is the bass.  They are wireless; so I can understand why that was sacrificed a bit for battery life.<br /><br />They worked so well we ordered a second pair for the other gaming system.  More than one headset can work in the same house/room together.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Beautifully written.  Knoth is a fascinating character with a fascinating story. I would like to have liked to have seen some of the secondary characters receive some additional development. But overall a very absorbing read that I would highly recommend!
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|Em rips it in this CD.  Him and 59 are great together. Hope they come out with another album together.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|It was what I wanted, and I loved it, i have to  keep writing so mister amazon will let me click the submit button and I don't really want to. bye.
1609611543|4.0|My cousin told me about this book and it really has helped her. I haven't read as much as I would like yet, but what I have has helped me.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|A 5-star game if they fix a couple small things. The concept behind the game is great. No complaints there. The board game is an entertaining game of strategy and efficient management of limited resources, looking to maximize the utility of every move. The game is great. The developer left out some important details, and I hope they improve it in later versions. My big gripe is with scoring. There is no clear definition of scoring rules. In fact, I haven't found any written rules at all for the game. After going through all the trouble to code a computer game from the board game, why not copy and paste the rules into the computer version of it????????? I want to know how scoring is calculated--particularly for fields/farms. I can't tell if you score per &quot;meeple&quot; (or tennent or whatever they're called) when you have an opponent on the same field/land, or if you have two to your opponent's one meeple, do you score and he doesn't--or do you score twice to his once?????? It's a great game, and this version for the Kindle Fire HD is really good, but how do you leave something so simple and fundamental as the rules for the game, nowhere to be found??????????! Somebody over at Exozet Games dropped the ball when they forgot to include a simple text document for the complicated scoring rules of Carcassonne. Also, when the game tallies scores for each player at the end, it goes so fast, and the score is not clearly displayed for each element, for each player, so you can't even deduce how scores are calculated when multiple players control the same area. The coders need to improve upon that as well. That is especially true if you're going to forget something as simple as the written rules for the game. The A.I. is a worthy opponent, and if you don't know how to predicts scoring, it's pretty hard to figure out the best way to beat the computer, or anybody else who knows how it's scored. There's really no excuse for leaving that information out.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a wonderful story and makes you learn to not take everything to granted and to be yourself and there will always be someone there for you. Well written story!
B001TODCII|5.0|No issues with product and great price. New and in the wrapper. Great movie. I recommend it. The sequel is great as well.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|It's cute enough, and G rated enough, for a kid, but challenging enough to entertain a grown-up for hours! My only complaint is that it's too short.<br /><br />Game contains several actions/reactions that made me laugh out loud. Awesome and the salute to Angry Birds was too perfect.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I hate the new &#34;kids' movies...&#34; You can't watch a single one that doesn't have violence, sexual innuendos, or some kind of stupid plot, but this is imagination at its best.  Perfect family movie.
B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I cna see why this didn't go over very well. Some good music...the pieces that tended to follow the original Phantom pieces....but the premise misses in light of the original Phantom story.
B006MPKAOI|5.0|Couldn't put this book down. Really gripping, had an excellent element of suspense, really gives you an insider view of domestic violence that I've never thought of before.<br /><br />Definitely recommend it!
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I love the music. I thought Emma Rossum's voice is better for this role than Sarah Brightman. Gerald Butler is adequate but not a standout for the role. I like him...just not in this. Movies sort of fill in gaps and this one does to some extent but it suffers from mediocre performances (except Emma's).
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app definitely a keeper forever  if u like architecture and its super fun and easy to learning McMinn mmznjznxmmxkxmdnbdnxn
B0071MQBX0|5.0|WOW! What performances! This was really great! The performances were outstanding. The ending with the other Phantoms...very reminiscent of Les Miz's 10th anniversary at the same place. It was wonderful to see them and Michael Crawford (who didn't sing...I suspect why). the didn't need to do Sarah Brightman (would have been great if they had gotten Emma, instead). I'm sure the folks under the huge chandelier were jumping....(I like the way the Vegas show works the chandelier...very cool). This is verymuch a 5 star performance and worth the price.
0425263924|5.0|the book came in the mail sooner than I expected, and before I was going to be traveling which was amazing. Its also a good series, if your into these types of books. I plan to order the next book from here as well!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy the fast pace of this game. Great fun for everyone, who love match games without spending a lot.
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|Full disclosure: I Kickstarted this game.<br /><br />Star Command is a wonderful tablet game.  Roam about the galaxy fighting aliens, balance your crew assignments between weapons, fighting off intruders, and oh my god there is a hole in the hull and everyone is shooting out into space!<br /><br />Fun, tense, and still being improved by the (small) development team.  Give it a look, it is well worth the asking price.
B007C94QRK|5.0|Extremely funny and entertaining! My husband kids and I love watching it over and over. Brought back memories from when I was 6 years old with the  muppet show!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I wouldn't doubt I didn't read the fine print enough. I own up to that. But I am really disappointed this thing ONLY works on a wifi network with internet access. I don't mean I want to stream over the network, but rather I mean accessing content too. I should be able to use my mobile data to access content and only use a local wifi to stream it to my devices. This not useful at all the other way!!!!! When my internet goes out and my router still works and my cell phone data works I should still be able to stream Netflix, but the way the system is set up you can't!<br /><br />I am glad it was only $35. It will collect dust now as a gadget that could have been great, but turned into meh.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I went and saw Sir Paul McCartney during the summer at Seattle's Safeco Field. His concert was the first public concert ever performed there and it was quite the show! So I was quite surprised to hear that he also had a new album coming out during the fall of 2013. It's amazing that he is able to perform a world wide tour and also have a brand new album with all new material out. I finally got my copy of ( New ) the other day. New in one word is Great! I won't break down the tracks one by one.....I will say that If you are looking for a bit of the Beatles or Wings or just McCartney himself this album will please you. At 71 years of age....McCartney show's that he still has it and can create music that is fresh and interesting. I have read other reviews that point to problems with his voice. I'll be frank....no one can sound what they sounded like when they were 25. But McCartney simply sounds fantastic for his age and doesn't miss a beat. I am sure he doesn't need to make music or perform concerts anymore......he does it because he loves it and it keeps him young. Thanks for the music Sir Paul!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can read these over and over!  Fun to reread and I am glad to have discovered these books.  Can't get enough.
0307887448|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, if you lived in the 80's, played video games and watched movies you will love this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Annoyingly addictive with just enough difficulty to keep you an encouraged. Looking forward to be the number one among my friends.
1592289444|5.0|This is one of the more amazing true stories about survival and determination I have ever read. What Rawicz endured and what he overcame in his journey to freedom is a testimony to the will of man. This one will be hard to put down. Just an excellent story. Buy it, you won't regret it!
0345803485|3.0|I ordered this for my daughter to complete the trilogy for her. I read the first and was told no need to read the other 2 as there wasn't much more to them. The seller sent the book quickly and there were no concerns

B009SGPUJ8|5.0|I've been aware of Devin Townsend's music since he was  the singer for Steve Vai. I kind of ignored Strapping Young Lad when I'd read through Century Media catalogs sent to me through the mail. For some reason, his music never spoke to me...Fast forward a thousand years later and last year I was streaming through some music and came across a familiar name- that of Devin Townsend. The song \\"Winter\\" shows up- and I'm mesmerized but the ambient atmospherics and softly sung voice of Devin. The drums barely registering, and a psychedelic baritone strung guitar plays a cool arpeggio over some reverbed out atmospheric nuance in the background. After stumbling upon this I decided to open my mind to other sounds and songs from this record. I must say- I like it. Now I'm wondering what the F my problem was with this guy in the past. Answer: I was being a close minded idiot.<br />Favorite tracks: \\"Disruptr\\" (cool, clean guitar but with some menace!), \\"Heaven's End\\"- (again starts off one mood then becomes<br />maniacal during the 'choruses')...for some reason the bands / artists that were coming to mind when listening to this disc:<br />Faith No More, Godflesh, A Perfect Circle, Sofia, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Joe Satriani, Pink Floyd, Elvis, The Stray Cats, -<br />it's a unique record. By no means do the bands I were describing sound like a direct influence - they just sorta reminded me<br />of those cats. I dig this album a lot and find myself playing it on occasion, especially driving my car to work.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Most of this story is heartbreaking, but many stories based on real events which were mere footnotes in the history books are frequently shocking, touching, emotionally wrenching and enlightening.  There is also love, caring and understanding, and an ending which leaves you with a gentle nostalgia.  I was totally unaware of the transport of orphaned children from New York to the midlands of America until reading this novel.  Much of it is based on interviews with some of the survivors and their children, and all of it rings true.<br /><br />The interaction between a young girl struggling through the foster care system today, and an elderly woman who once rode an 'orphan train', is really well-done and develops in a sensitive and careful manner.  The stories of both these women, young and old, are well worth the time spent spent with them.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This is such an interesting book. I learned so many things about World War I. It is easy to see why World War II occurred when many of the problems were created during World War I. The characters are vivid and you want to know what happened to them.
0802473156|5.0|This book is easy to read and has good suggestions for lovers.  Practical steps to take to bring more intimacy to marriage.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King never disapoints any reader. Read all of his works since I first read Salems Lot. He is the only author that scares me.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent book, not quite as scary as The Shining but wrapped up the story of Danny very well. I enjoyed reading both The Shining and Doctor Sleep. I read them back to back so it was nice to pic up the story so again and follow to his happy life
B008UWEFU6|4.0|Well written, slightly predictable plot. I could not stop reading until finished with all three books.  Fun reading when you have the time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I normally don't read these kind of books but thought I would check out what all the raves were about. Not a fan of the &#34;f&#34; word and all it's useless ways it was used in the book. Kept my attention so it was a good read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The episodes continue to be interesting, well written, containing humor, tragedy, warmth, love, hate....all the human emotions. I love the period piece and the knowledge I've gained about that time in history.
B008XJM86Y|5.0|Love Myles Kennedy's voice. The band is strong and the music hits all emotions. Would recommend for anyone who likes Creed, Seether, Shinedown etc.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|The book is interesting. The book speaks to how really important those first few years of a child's life shape their personality and self esteem. The lead character, Victoria, is bounced around through foster care her entire life until she turns 18 and is released by the state. She's an adult because she's 18, but she's still just a child in many ways. Victoria is sad, angry, scared...she also annoys you, but you still root for her. The flower language helps weave a creative plot line and Vanessa Diffenbaugh has a knack for telling a story, albeit a nice, tidy package…but that’s kind of where you really want it to go. Victoria has had some rough times and she gets a few breaks—and you really want to see the good stuff work out for her.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|\\"Oh, ok, I get it now. That's why this book is considered one of the greats,\\" she said to herself after slavishly soaking up the last page. Superb book, gorgeous writing. My only disappointment is that I didn't read it earlier in life. Recently, I caught the \\"let me go back and read all the books I should have read in high school and college, but didn't.\\" Luckily, this was first up. Both a morality tale and a dialogue on aestheticism, this short work is jam-packed with one-liners that will tickle your inner philosopher. It's the first time in a very long time that I've read a book in a sitting, and I'm pretty sure I have ADD, so, ya know, that's saying a lot. But the best part: it was free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Very good, kept my son playing for hours, i wish it was more like the computer version this though bit itbis still a goodvgamme
B000002LAC|3.0|The harmonies are beautiful but some of the songs are sort of sappy.  Emmy Lou Harris is outstanding as always, and Rhonstadt is powerful.  Dolly is crystalline and her original song about wildflowers is terrific.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Just started to learn how to play the game. Seems fun but will know more after completing a couple more rooms. Would think it would be better if the items you found were part of a puzzle to solve for each room.<br /><br />Ok played it for a couple more days and have a better understanding of what is going on. I completely agree with the one review in that patients is a key factor. Kind of like the energy thing as it helps me not to spend so much time playing the game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is very addictive...can't out it down. Very fun. Easy to learn but also challenging. Even younger kids can be taught and love it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It is a good product but im not completely satisfied with the purchase.  It bought it because I thought it was web browsing capable
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game will be better if they fix the blood it doesn't looks like the real blood ether<br /><br />Don't buy this game if you have kids or little friends<br /><br />It has a lot of splashing blood when you shot the animal specifically with a rifle or an assault rifle !!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got candy crush on my iPhone and my iPod. When I got my kindle though,I wanted it and all I could find was cheap ripoffs by cheap company's. I am SO glad I can play my favorite game. I love you Amazon
B00000K3D4|5.0|The puppetry was amaizing!  For it's time.  David Bowie is an outstanding artist in more ways than one. The rest of the cast did a spectacular job!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is the second sci-fi book I've read in four years and out of these two books this is the better one. I cannot begin to describe why I like this book. It may have to do with the psychology of all the children in this book and what they go through and how they treat Ender with the ending and all (I'm not going to tell you though sorry) But anyway this was a great read and since this reading was for my comp 1 English class I am going to read the next 15 chapters which I guess is the next book ( I hope!)
B00EC6VA98|5.0|This is not as accessible as the debut - it requires a few listens to sink in. For me Philharmonics was an easy listen, just a great poppy release straight off the bat and all the way through. This one is more challenging and a tad more experimental. On the first couple of listens 'Run Cried The Crawling' and 'The Curse' sounded most like the predecessor in terms of pop sensibility but none of these tracks are straightforward verse and chorus types - for example 'Run' veers off to a strange but wonderful place in the final minute painting a really poetic sound-scape.<br /><br />The arrangements give more prominence to the cello and violin so the album may seem more classical but in truth, I'm not so sure - it is essentially still a record the average music fan will find themselves latching on to the vocal and piano melodies. The tunes lurk  further in the lower registers than on Philharmonics, and seem to be cut from a more sophisticated cloth.<br /><br />I'm still trying to find a weak track from this artist - what a fantastic start she has made. How many artists have two early albums that work so well played straight through? After about ten listens to this one I'm now falling over myself with appreciation for this release. She has a gift for bringing the various components of the music together to work as a harmonious whole. Not so sure about the words - if she gets that right, not that so far it is a problem, but there is much room for improvement - that's all I'm saying - if she gets the words up a level she will find herself in the premier division if she is not there already. Vocally, I'm in, she just has it down with a natural feel for music, using her voice as an instrument. To be clear, this is a deeply moving and beautiful album from start to finish one I already know I'll be listening to a great deal. I'm gushing a bit I know but it is actually better than Philharmonics and has totally surpassed my expectations.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an entertaining book and it put me through the same surreal experience as watching episodes of \\"Arrested Development\\" - satirical and darkly humorous. A secret, enclosed in an envelope, was the catalyst that disrupted and intertwined the lives of three women Cecilia, Rachel and Tess, like a domino effect. The epilogue is truly diabolical.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|The CD/DVD  came on time and packaged wonderfully. The music is fantastic and so was the documentary.I would recommend this to everyone who is a Doobie Bros. fan!

B008220BLG|4.0|Warm Bodies 4 stars★...<br /><br />I think it's maybe a 4 star movie. Almost one at least for it's originality and satire. On the cable's description, it's genres are comedy, sci-fi and horror. I didn't think this was a horror movie, but rather more a comedy satire movie. A satire to zombies and teen angst. Definitely a satire to teen angst. I was a little reluctant to watch this because of the possibility of being a horror movie. Now a days I get spooked pretty easily and was happy that this isn't a horror movie, but rather a little suspenseful.<br /><br />The story was original and it was a little funny at times with R's commentary. I think Rob Corddy brought more comedy to the movie. The way he performed as a zombie was funny. Interesting that only he and R have talking roles as zombies - even \\"exhumed zombies.\\" And there is a moral story to this. Maybe a bit of a spoiler. But this was obvious and predictable even if it was original. The way to \\"exhume\\" Earth and cure it of zombies is to teach them to learn to love and what it means to really be alive.<br /><br />This was cute and I might be tempted to watch again some other time when I'm in the mood for a zombie comedy. Although, if I had to choose between this and Shaun of the Dead, I'd choose Shaun hands down.<br /><br />I did like R's commentary and I think I wouldn't have watched the movie if it wasn't done the comedic way it was.<br />Oh and I liked how he even asked not to watch us eat the guy and that he was ashamed of it, making him seem more human than zombie.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Really really loved the story, especially Christian.<br />Didn't like Ana at all.<br />Seemed like she made Christian do all the compromising whilst she didn't make any compromise.<br />My friends all agree, Ana is really unlikeable.

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|That's why Cinderella has always been a great rock & roll band...great songwriting, ear for hooks and country/blues influences...the whole GLAM thing was just baggage and Cinderella surely transcended that scene, which was more about looks and image, not music or songwriting...aka TOM's songwriting, playing and inimitable voice.  This here record PROVES what I just said in spades...Tom writes great songs, PERIOD, with killer melodies, a timeless approach that is also unique, he plays the songs well, and he sings em in what in other people would be a screech, but he turns it into an expressive soulful falsetto that is almost like gospel...yet here, he uses his more lower & mid registers which make these songs more alt-country and classic rock-sounding...YET this record is not dated in the least...it's timeless and utterly fresh, with a nice energy...credit also goes to his wife Savannah, who cowrote most of the songs here and sings in beautiful harmony!!<br /><br />14 great songs that prove why Tom has been around since 1986 and longer...they say you have to REALLY LIVE LIFE to write great rock & roll (and blues and country too)...and Tom surely has life experience in spades...his and Savannah's honest, hardhitting (and funny at times too) lyrics really show this...all 14 songs are great...some that stand out are opener \\"Solid Ground\\", \\"Cold Day In Hell\\", \\"Ain't That A B*tch\\"...not one dud cut in the bunch...<br /><br />I HOPE there will be more sooner...I think there will because his voice is back in top shape, and he has a great self-funded record deal with Warners' indie distribution...I THINK he prob has a nice backlog of songs in his vault...I'm sure 10 years weren't for naught and was always writing...he IS part of the whole Nashville songwriting community...it would be cool if he met up with likeminded souls like Taylor Swift and Keith Urban...attempted to write songs together and see what happens...that would be awesome!!<br /><br />Go TOM...welcome back buddy!!  Surely one of 2013's best albums by far!!y!!  Surely one of 2013's best albums by far!!
B006OMM8RG|4.0|packaging was crushed, the toy was in tact but the box was crushed.  I am sure the young man it is inteded for will love it.
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|I just LOVE Diane's progression on this record...now, if you read my flabbergasted review of Diane's \\"Bible Belt\\", how she is like Laura Nyro (RIP) reincarnated, you will know how much I love her art.  I read about her goth/punk covers EP \\"Velveteen Age\\", and thought, \\"hmmm, if Diane manages to combine the 2 sides of her musical duality, aka her sublime Laura Nyro pop with her goth tendencies, that will be something and an innovative sound!!\\"...and she actually DID it on \\"Speak A Little Louder\\"!!<br /><br />You CAN hear \\"Bible Belt\\"/Laura Nyro pop here, like on great songs such as \\"Love & War\\" and the gorgeous & catchy \\"Pretty In Pain\\", but she adds her darker, gothic, dramatic, vulnerable side much more often...and when she does, Diane evokes Florence Welch, Kate Bush & Sarah McLachlan...which is quite welcome...like on the title track and \\"UNFKD\\"...she combines the two styles as well on club-friendly cuts like \\"Lighthouse\\"...I can hear remixes being made right now...she works with come cool people too, like Aqualung/Matt Hales, Questlove, Dap Kings drummer Homer Steinweiss, Eg White, etc...LOVE the foldout poster and artwork...just lovely...Diane is one beautiful woman...I also feel her pain with the loss of her dad and end of her last relationship...I want to give her a hug...<br /><br />All in  all, I LOVE \\"Bible Belt\\"...just a classic debut, but I love her progression and direction here too...not saying it's better or worse, but it's all part of a huge grand plan indeed...her career...Diane is here to stay...as she should...a fine contender for one of 2013's finest releases...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Definitely lived up to all the hype. Can't believe i didn't read it sooner. My new favorite trilogy!! Fell in love with Peeta<br /><3
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The books is well written and easy to read. His views are not original and for the most part he has selected those views of authors/researchers which are primary sources which support the view he is putting forth. His story is one that paints Jesus of Nazareth as a revolutionary crucified predictably by a mean spirited Roman governor in cooperation with Caiaphas and his minions. He suggests Christianity is the creation of the early church fathers as a continuation of a movement initiated by Paul. He suggests Paul succeeds because of the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and with it the Jesus Dynasty rightly passed on from Jesus to his younger brother James.<br />Given Aslan's testimony at the outset of his literary journey one has to wonder what his motives are beyond what he has told us in the Author's note when he says \\"I began to rethink the faith and culture of my forefathers, finding in them as an adult a deeper, more intimate familiarity than I ever had as a child, the kind that comes from reconnecting with an old friend after many years apart.\\", and, \\"Today, I can confidently say that two decades of rigorous academic research into the origins of Christianity has made me a more genuinely committed disciple of Jesus of Nazareth than I ever was of Jesus Christ. My hope with this book is to spread the good news of Jesus of history with the same fervor that I once applied to spreading the story of the Christ.<br />We all have our presuppositions and mine should be apparent. I can't help wondering whether Aslan has a hidden agenda beyond sharing his years of research with a popular audience.
B00004T9UF|1.0|I've never been so disappointed in my life! I ordered this a week ago and I waited and got it in the mail today! I was so excited to open it and listen to the Marshall Mathers LP.. When I open it up I see, to my amazement, there was no disc! They just sent me the cd case! I was very upset about this! I do not recommend buying this online, I'd give it 0 stars if it were allowed.. I also request compensation from zooverstocks.. Waste of money,, waste of time..
B000002L7R|5.0|I feel that this cd was misunderstood due to the fact that a lot of people where still high on Prince last cd, Purple Rain.  I also feel that in order to enjoy this cd one must be a big fan of Prince and also have a very strong understanding of both him as well as his music.  If you've never heard this cd, then now is the time too..............
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|An earth interpenetrated with time travel portals, parallel universes and windows to altered realities - mental travel on the astral, layer upon layer of interwoven and juxtaposed reincarnations - an author, well studied in physics, string theory and extra spatial dimensions smoothly waltzes the reader through the fantastic as if we were walking in the neighborhood park, playing on the swings, seesaw, slide, and merry-go-round. Everything is possible and everything is believable.<br /><br />Mystics and seers, direct, aiding our heroes to fulfill their destinies, the beginnings of which began thousands of years before, and the culmination of which may be their present lifetime or thousands of years in the future as one minor event in any parallel universe can change the course of events.

B000ICXQXI|4.0|I just saw the film The Seventh Victim by Val Lewton last night. In this film, he has Kim Hunter in a shower in a confrontation with one of the leaders of a satanic cult. I wonder if Hitchcock saw this film, and was inspired by that shower scene. How many other films before Psycho featured a female protagonist in a shower?
B001VLXNLU|4.0|It was good. I was a little confused by the beginning, but I hope more detail evolves in later books.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an extremely fun game. Highly addictive but so worth the time. You can waste several hours a day playing this. My favorite free game.
1439170916|5.0|For anyone interested in the history of medicine, the internicine fueds, clashing egos and resistance to accepting evidence which doesn't fit preconceived ideas, this book is a 'must-read'.  At times a mystery, thriller and puzzle, the book makes science and the history of cancer research readily accessible and absolutely fascinating.  I could simply not put this book down!
B001H5X7JS|5.0|It is everything you would expect from Ben Stiller . Very funny but not for young audiences . I loved it
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Another great learning app by 22Learn. It's a very interactive and attractive app that's ideal for kids that may be struggling with their abc's. Our little girl loves it and enjoys it like her regular 'toys' while we see the educational value from it. It's great to see her reaction when she figures something out. It makes me feel good to see her having an enjoyable learning experience because my parents like to remind me how I hated learning my abc's. Now I think it was because learning was not so fun and engaging then! That said, the app is very user friendly and our little girl was able to navigate her way through it without us having to sit with her all the way though. Plus, the way she was engaging with it has me thinking that it may actually be helping her motor skills, too.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|The basic design is good and it seems reliable. It could do so much more with better representation of weather patterns and what is in the forecast.

B008EL25LE|5.0|Each level gets more complex. Not sure if there is some type of help to refresh what the various pieces do during the game. Sometimes it is several days before I can get back to the game.
B004UIOUHC|2.0|I had this in my tablet. A mistake. Wrong browser. Just got the &quot;web&quot; version snd it is really good.  This &quot;mobile&quot; verson would not respond when I tapped links in s Google search page. It would go totally stupid.  But the other version works fine. And it is amazingly fast.
B005SO6TLM|5.0|I ran up on the phenom by watching his story on Netflix, &#34;Charles Bradley: The Soul of America. I immediately downloaded his album via amazon before the documentary was over, and the rest is history. When I say, new age James Brown sound, deep soul, pure good feeling music, I am not exaggerating. We listen to the cd morning, noon, and night. Can't get enough and can't wait to see him live and up close.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|. . .  it does not do all what it needs to do or should do.  In My eBay there is to be found no Purchase History list  (But I must admit, I could not get that up in a web browser using Android, either.  Seems to be broken.)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|At first I thought it was too easy but it did progress in difficulty. I definitely want to see more levels come out. That must be a sign of a good game.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|Closed Captions do not show in the Hitchcock film, The Lady Vanishes.  And I know that YouTube provides them for this movie.  But in the app there can be found  no button to turn Closed Captions on.  And that button needs to be added in for a higher than a three star rating.

B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Very good game. Very graphic and it has actual task instead of just killing deer and you can choose different guns and use infer red .
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl Crow's older albums are my favorite. I always loved how her songs were a mixture of different types of music. My two favorite albums of hers are her self-titled album and The Globe Sessions. They are such fantastic albums that it seems almost impossible for her to top. I wasn't all that impressed with her previous few albums, so I wasn't sure what to think about this one. Especially since it's a full on country album, and I've never been the biggest country fan. I'm glad I gave this record a shot. I love it almost as much as her first three albums. \\"Shotgun\\" and \\"Best of Times\\" are my favorite tracks.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This game is good and all but really boring. It's just like any other jewels game that you move the jewels or candy yo match the color. Uninstalled.
0385528787|3.0|This is such a tricky book to review - as the conclusion to the two works 'Oryx and Crake' and 'The Year of the Flood' that I enjoyed tremendously, I fell right back into the post-apocalyptic world that Atwood had created quite naturally. However, it was also inevitable that some unfair comparison would be made with its predecessors.    I would not recommend reading 'MaddAddam' on its own, even though there is a helpful synopsis of the two preceding works in the introduction. The complexity of Snowman-the-Jimmy's relationship with Crake/Glenn and Oryx cannot be comprehended without reading the first book, and Jimmy's strange role as the guardian of the Crakers would puzzle most readers.    While 'The Year of the Flood' was billed as a \\"simultaneoul\\" (or simultaneous sequel) to the first book, since the events of both books happened simultaneously and converged at the end of both books, 'MaddAddam' picks up from the pivotal ending and continues the story, focusing on Toby and Zeb, together with the ragamuffin group of bedraggled survivors the MaddAdamites, who try to form an uneasy commune with the posthumans, the Crakers. When the Crakers were introduced to us in 'Oryx and Crake', the peculiarity of their bio-enhanced traits (like insect-repellent skin, unproblematic mating rituals, and docile personalities, etc) might have enthralled the readers, but in this last book, their ineffective purring over physical injuries and relentless need to have the tales of Oryx and Crake told to them while constantly interrupting with their singing and questions, lose their charm for this reader, and becomes jarring, as Atwood, perhaps with self-conscious awareness, inserts as humorous asides in Toby's tales.    Plotwise, nothing much happens, besides keeping the two escaped Painballers (yet another cast ensemble that needs some prior introduction) at bay, while trying to protect their community, with allies that come from some unexpected quarters - rumps and snouts included. Thefrustrated romance between Toby and Zeb (which I found to be The Year of the Flood's weakest link) burrows its way back into the narrative, but perhaps as a way to introduce the backstory of Zeb and Adam One, so that the links between the storyworlds of the previous two books are bound more closely together.    Atwood's writing remains as incisive and her prose lively. The ponderous issues about what makes humans human that resound in the first two books are still present, though they are seen on a more personal level, even as Toby contemplates the old graffiti left behind on the walls of a biolet (lavatory): \\"What to eat, where to s***, how to take shelter, who and what to kill: are these the basics?... Is this what we've come to, or come down to; or else come back to?\\" Despite Crake's grand design for a super posthuman world, what goes round comes around, and around again.

B00E5N8DGG|5.0|I attended all 11 VIVA! Hysteria shows in Las Vegas, as well as the 2 premiere showings of the movie. The movie premiere included a recording of the acoustic set that the band performed for the Meet and Greet VIP guests exclusively, which is on the DVD. I can assure anyone who didn't get to see the Vegas shows or the movie premiere that, if you like, or love, Def Leppard, you will like, or love, the DVD. One reason I made the decision to attend all 11 of the Vegas shows is that Def Leppard is just super-fantastic live. They put on a great show, successfully delivering their studio recorded hits to the live concert without anything lost. From Joe expertly drawing the crowd into the experience, to Sav, Phil, Viv, and Rick delivering consummate instrumental/backing vocal performances, they do not disappoint. They really do sound as good or better live than recorded and stay true to the music. That said, the recording of the VIVA! Hysteria shows is very well done and presented, and I feel is superb enough to excite, even the modest to definitely, the die-hard fan! Included on the DVD is a Ded Flatbird set, where Def Leppard performed some of their other-than-Hysteria-hits, posing incognito as a Def Leppard cover band. I am having a very hard time, indeed, awaiting my copy to arrive from Amazon....

B007SVPZMW|4.0|I got this for the FAOTD and thought my 3 year old might like it.  It is still slightly above him, but it does go automatically and you can set it on EASY.  I'm not sure that it is easy enough for the youngest kid, but it certainly is one of many items that he enjoys on my phone now.  Downside is that you can't choose to be a solo X player and always go first.  One other down side is that fact that they have done cute animations for the appearance of the X or O, but you have to sit and watch it.  You can't just click the 30th time you have seen two worms form an X.  It is worth it for small kids since you can be one or two players.
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|We bought this game for my 11-year-old's Kindle Fire.  He really enjoys playing with it.  I don't like the pressure to do in-game purchases, but we have it set up so that he can't do that, so it's not a big deal.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book told of the strength of the human spirit.  The Book Thief had me feeling happy and laughing and then crying and sad.  This book tryely is the greatest book I have ever read.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|Vaughn Heppner's got writing about battle in his blood. This is my second novel of his, and once started it got under my skin. I had to read it. Had to know what the hell this guy Creed would do to survive another day and live up to his promise that he would make the scumbags who destroyed Earth pay. Creed is a former soldier and convict who wound up on a security detail at a base in Antarctica. Real hero, right? But this guy is more than his resume or rap sheet would lead you, the reader, to believe. His father was an ace pilot and daredevil who is the first to engage a massive space ship that shows up in the planet's orbit. Dad tries to make contact, but the aliens blast him out of the sky. Then they destroy most of Earth's major cities and send bio agent that wipes out all life. Some people survive. Creed commandeers an alien lander that has come to take human samples for a human army. Little of it makes sense to him. Somehow humanity's become ensnared in some corporate battle for dominance and a fight over religious relics. The opposition is tremendous. Humans are considered animals, and that pisses Creed off. Turns out it's not good to make him angry. A real page turner.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This is a great game, one that you have to pay attention, lots of fun<br />haven't played a lot yet, but what I have played is pretty good
1846148030|3.0|I can see why many people like this book, but for me it was just too full of food-nerd detail to be enjoyable. I really loved Pollan's Food Rules, and my favorite parts of this book were those that pointed out the differences between how most of us eat now and how we used to eat before food production became industrialized. However, those parts were few and far between and surrounded by endless long discussions of the chemical reactions that take place when air meets yeast to make bread....ZZZZ. I skimmed most of these parts because it just didn't interest me. I'm not a food nerd; I'm a working mom who would like to get better at cooking. Pollan divides the book into 4 chapters based on the 4 elements. My favorite chapter was water, because I found it to contain the most useful information with practical application to life. I'm never going to roast a whole pig or brew my own beer and, as some others have mentioned, Pollan makes bread-baking sound so complex that he  pretty much scared me away for life. I was, however, disappointed by how complicated the one &#34;water&#34; recipe he includes at the end of the book was. I'll never make something that takes 3 hours and uses nearly two cups of olive oil! I did feel that this book was a little elitist in that how many people truly have the time to cook and eat in the ways he describes? Maybe if you're a freelance writer with a grown child and a budget to buy a whole pig, yes. For the average Josephine at work 9-5 or later and commuting another 2 hours, no. For a book that covers some of the same issues on a more practical level, I much prefer The Kitchen Counter Cooking School - a book that really changed my life and that &#34;Cooked&#34; makes me want to go back and read again. That said, I really don't think I'm the audience for this book, but if you like nerding out over craft beers and shop at Whole Foods, you might enjoy it. Also, I think this book would appeal more to men than women because I've noticed when mendo get into cooking, they tend to geek out on it way more than women do.....I'd love to see Jeffrey Steingarten and Michael Pollan in a cook-off.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|You will love this one . It's a mind game that explodes on you when you get it all figured out. It's clear that this book is a clever example of the best laid plans will never go as planned. Love is gonna get us no matter what we think.
B005544V6A|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this show but sadly my first instinct was, &#34;USA Network...really?&#34;.  I'll eat crow on this one and say that Suits has quickly become one of my favorite shows.  It's smart, edgy, funny and fast-paced.  Love it and definitely recommend trying it out by streaming it on a rainy weekend or something, you'll be hooked.

B00BSBR9N6|5.0|From practically the moment I started the book, I knew what the basic plot and outcome would be; surprisingly, this didn't affect my enjoyment of the book and its characters. Simsion has a deft hand with making his characters relatable and entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud quite often as I was reading. While sometimes the dialogue veers into almost Conehead-like delivery (\\"we should timeshare it with pizza consumption and beer drinking\\" is one example), for the most part I could suspend my disbelief to enjoy this funny, unexpectedly moving, story. I look forward to the sequel, and recommend this book to anyone who'd like a fun, enjoyable read.

B000J103PC|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my niece but I have watched it and love it. It shows how being in the rich big time seen of life isn't always cracked up to what it looks like it would be. Good lesson to young girls.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been hoping that this game would come to the Kindle and it is a very addictive game, cause when you start playing you just don't wanna stop. Now all I need is Pet Rescue Saga and I will be complete.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game at first I thought this game is so easy so then when you get to level 30 it gets harder and harder.
6304711905|5.0|This is a great story about Wyatt Erpp. It has a great cast. I was most impressed with Val Kilmer. I never liked him because of the part he played in &#34;Top Gun&#34; although he played his part good, but the part he plays as Doc Holliday in this movie just kills me. He is so good that I just can help but love him.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I got this awhile back as a faotd. The graphics are great...controls a bit tricky to get the hang of. Overall not a bad game but in order to play the game it requires 2 things....internet connection and a current log in to the app store! Really!?....uninstalled.

B00EJOCB4G|4.0|Packaging and delivery were fine.  It is a Christmas gift so cannot provide any further comments for this review.  Appeared to be as advertised.
B001TW68P4|5.0|Had this years ago and I'm happy to have it again. Saw the Turtles live on the Happy Together Tour and remembered how much I enjoyed them.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|Awfully slick. Taxes credulity. Loads of fun. This was my first  Child's read and I'm racing to my next.<br /><br />Richesnow
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting ever since I got my kindle to get this app and its great!! I lobe it so much!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Definitely one of the best movies of 2013, if you haven't seen it, you should, end of story. It's like 10 or more years of anime/cartoons (evangelion, transformers) condensed in one EPIC movie. I own the steelbook edition, although I wanted to buy the lenticular one so I could just stay there watching and saying gypsy!kaiju!gypsy!kaiju. On a side note, the music is awesome, spine chilling awesome!.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This awesome game allows you and your kids to have a great time together and the best part is that it is based off if a great movie.  You interact with the charters and its a great way to have a great time.
B008C20TDG|5.0|When I first scanned this book earlier this summer, I thought, \\"No way! That's too drastic. I can't give up all that food!\\"  Sure, giving up legumes wouldn't be that hard.  I could give up sugar.  I could give up seed oils. But, no grains?  No dairy (my beloved cheese)? No artificial sweeteners?  Would I have to drink my coffee black?  I didn't think I could do that.  How would I ever eat out?<br /><br />So, I set the book aside.<br /><br />Then, in August, while on vacation, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror in my swimsuit.  Ugh. What happened?  How did I manage to weigh more than I did at the height of my pregnancy with my first child?  And, thinking back on my most recent physical, what could I do about those high triglycerides? Maybe I really did need to make a \\"drastic\\" change.<br /><br />Fortunately, the book was on my iPad Kindle reader and I read it again, more closely.  I was convicted by the common sense, the reasoning and the evidence.  I would start the Whole 30 on Sept. 1.<br /><br />Fast forward 30 days.  I had lost 9 lbs.  My skin was smoother.  My clothes were looser.  My husband was impressed and he wanted to do the program starting Oct. 1.  So, now I'm doing a second 30 days.  While I will occasionally go off the diet for special occasions, I plan on eating this way the rest of my life.<br /><br />This method of eating is not for people who are not committed to their health nor is it for people who are not willing to take the time to plan meals, shop carefully (and probably spend more on groceries), and spend more time prepping food (I often will often prep several meals, especially breakfast, at one time).  We are eating out less, because it is a little tricky ordering food at some restaurants (I now check out menus online).  It does get easier.<br /><br />My husband and I are so enthused about the results that we have given about 6 copies of the book as gifts in the past month.  Aside from books I've written and the Bible, I've never given so many copies of a book as gifts.en so many copies of a book as gifts.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I was expecting a lot of gore and it wasn't like that at all. First Brad Pitt movie I've seen in a while that I liked. He did a good job. The movie is kind of slow after the beginning where it hits but I enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I  think the game is addictive. I didn't know that I could get on this game every day. Every body should play it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|If you like science fiction and/or future scenarios, this book will please you. Very imaginative with an engaging set of characters and full of action.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|What could be wrong with any CD released by Sting! This is a wonderful collection of songs from his new play The Last Ship. I love it!
B00571F26Y|2.0|This book came highly recommended from all kinds of health and food related blogs and I was eager to read it. I was so incredibly disappointed by what I found, however, that I did not finish it.<br /><br />1. The repetition was appalling and ridiculous. Everyone knows that obesity is an enormous problem, yet instead of merely stating this or stating it and then supporting it with the latest statistics, the author enumerates everyone he can think of \\"you are fat, your family is fat, your friends are fat, your dog is fat....\\" ad nauseum. This type of childish and annoyingly pointless repetition happens in several chapters and comes off as though the author were merely trying to inflate his word count.<br /><br />2. More than once, the author's poor organization lead to information being presented in inaccurate or potentially misleading ways. Although he corrected the situations in later chapters, it's extremely bad writing (particularly in what is supposed to be an informative, non-fiction book) to let this happen. Example: Assertion that if you give up wheat, you will lose weight - accompanied by multiple examples from the author's own experience. A couple chapters later, a caveat! Oh wait, you can't replace wheat with gluten-free substitutes (even though he's just spent several chapters lecturing on the evils of gluten) because those carbs are also bad. Another chapter or two later, more caveats. More exemptions or additional steps. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />3. Much of what was said was poorly supported. Serious allegations about undiagnosed Celiac disease being rampant and leading the massive rise in a variety of cancers is the most prominent example that comes to mind, but far from the only one. If the author's allegations are true (or at least soundly based in science), there should have been thorough support for them, rather than just assertions and speculation.<br /><br />4. Perhaps my opinion is influenced by having had the audio-book version, but the author's tone throughout the book was irritating. He spoke with superiority rather than authority, and with no compassion for his readers or patients, despite the serious struggle many people have with both wheat and their weight. He comes off as arrogant and obnoxious in places, which made the book hard to read or take seriously.<br /><br />5. No discussion was made of the difference between sourdough or sprouted breads and regular breads, despite evidence they interact with the body differently. Whatever his opinion on the subject, it seems it would have been appropriate to at least cover briefly.<br /><br />Whether you absolutely have seen a miracle through wheat elimination or would never consider it, this is not the book to base your opinion or actions on. There is much better out there, and I advise not wasting your time or money on this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Once you overcome the set-up, it's a pretty cool, useful device.  I could not set it up with my Samsung Chromebook, which seemed counter-intuitive since I ordered to Chromecast to use with the Chomebook.  In any event, I was able to use my daughter's ipod touch to set up the Chromecast on the HDTV (pretty easily actually) and then downloaded the Chromecast software to  the Chromebook and I was off and running.  It's great for sending a movie from Netflix on the Chromebook to the HDTV and I discovered you can actually close up the Chromebook and it seems to just keep streaming directly.  Pausing it or stopping and starting it will cause it to glitch, but if you just want to start a movie or tv show and watch right through this is a great device.
B00EUS9JF0|4.0|Modernly produced by various prominent professionals.<br />Refreshing: nowhere is violin orchestration, probably for the first time (or perhaps since McCartney II (1980))?!<br /><br />Great to have some melodic rockers on the album like \\"Save us\\", \\"Queenie eye\\" (and to a lesser extent) \\"I can bet\\"; some of McCartney's great strenghts. Very original track on the album is \\"Appreciate\\" with variations in pace, melody and atmosphere, supported by trippy sound effects, instrumentarium and harmonies: really fantastic! Similar \\"Alligator\\" and \\"Road\\": also very good tunes. \\"New\\" is a typical sunny power pop song that is so McCartney-ish.<br /><br />Then there a couple of tracks that are good, but fall a bit flat (with outros I just don't get: \\"Looking at her\\" and \\"Hosanna\\"): \\"Early days\\" and \\"Turned out\\". I don't think i will listen to these songs much in the future.<br /><br />Probably my taste,  I would like to have heard a bit more individual instruments to the forefront, for example the bass on \\"Save us\\";  I like the more traditional produced songs like \\"Get my out of here\\" and the hidden track \\"Scared\\" very much.<br />The latter track is a astonishing beautiful ballad; only piano and vocals, with no (violin) orchestration to push it over the top!)))<br /><br />Overall, a good and varied album in which his musical genius comes out successfully, and sometimes less successfully.<br /><br />Glad Paul is still making inspired albums. I hope he will continue doing that. He has an unique sound!
1476727651|5.0|this is a great book to get into. as i keep reading, it gets better n better. u can just visualize the story in your head as you go along. great sequel to a stephen king classic!
B001QWBM62|5.0|This piece of gear comes with a lot of functions that the average user won't need or ever use but it is really good at what it does. The meters are very helpful and I would know when to adjust my settings. I'm an amateur with recording but having all the bells and whistles that the H4N provides sure does make my work a whole lot easier.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|4 seasons in, the zombies are still terrifying. But additional threats of plague, insane people, (and dare I hope... Hunters?.. the comic fans will know what I am referring to there)- keep this show absolutely addictive.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the comic, the show is still easy to follow and well worth watching. But for those who do read TWD, its really a treat to see the characters and destroyed world come to life onscreen.<br /><br />I wonder if we'll meet Neegan.. or will the show take its own direction? The talent in both the pages and on screen is explosive. What wickedly cool works of art!
0803738412|5.0|I love this book.  I bought it for my almost 2 year old on the recommendation of someone else and I'm so glad I did.  The story is cute and clever and the illustrations are cute as well.  I'll be buying more Julia Donaldson books for sure.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some levels are very frustrating and many quit playing if they can't continue after days.  I play it every day.
