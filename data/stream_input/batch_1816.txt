B002SAUCBC|5.0|I loved this book, for some reason the title never jumped out at me as a &#34;must read&#34; but I gave it a shot and I highly reccomend this one. I couldnt put it down!!
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire wasn't nearly as good as the Hunger Games, but it didn't disappoint.  Collins delivered a solid sequel that kept me wanting to read more.  Looking forward to the movie release.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Here I go again, getting another Angry Bird game! Yes, this game is just as ADDICTIVE!!!!!! as the first one.  It still amazes me how much fun Angry Bird games are. The different backgrounds makes it interesting to see whats coming next.
0439023521|5.0|As an adult, I wondered if I would like a book potentially aimed at a younger audience, but I wanted to know what all the fuss was about so I decided to read it.  I wasn't disappointed!  The story line is one of a kind, and it's well written.  Collins does a great job painting pictures in your mind so you connect with the characters.  I wouldn't allow young kids to read it, but Jr. High and up would enjoy it.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Another Christmas &#34;classic.&#34; Just a fun, lighthearted movie. Adults and kids will love this movie. Don't miss out on it.
0439023513|3.0|I won't spoil the ending for those who haven't read it, but I will say that it left some to be desired.  Collins is a great author for her targeted audience, but I would have preferred the plot to go a different direction.  Overall, though, an innovative trilogy that I enjoyed reading.
0143034901|5.0|Since I must write twenty words, I feel the need to write, \\"Just read the damn book!\\" five times. It was one of the most memorizing books I have ever read. Amazing. Simply amazing.<br /><br />Just read the damn book.
B005LAII94|3.0|Convoluted plot, and too long by 30 minutes, this tale of double-crossing California dope dealers clashing with a killer Mexican pot cartel leaves quite a lot to be desired. Travolta looks horrid as a compromised DEA agent, but at least he shows how bald he really is for a change. A lot of gore, but somehow it's not as revolting as you would expect, thanks to the fast pace. Gore is not really the objective here, but I'm not sure what is. The message, if there is one, escaped me. The ending allows the director to indulge a couple of different scenarios. And what is Brahms' 1st Symphony doing in the soundtrack anyway? Weird.
B005HSG3U6|3.0|It's great for just a case. It's kind of hard to get it stand up. Overall, its okay. If you are ordering it just for the fact it can stand, don't order it.

1585673927|4.0|As a little girl, I can remember my dad watching late-night reruns of the Bertie and Jeeves television series, starring Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry, and wondering what on earth he found so funny about a show focusing on two men with (what seemed to me then) strange accents and weird clothes.  Thankfully, I revised my opinion of the show - and the books on which they are based - dramatically in later years when I was again exposed to them and realized how funny they are.  Granted, the stories are not great literature and are generally repetitions on the same theme, but Wodehouse adds just enough variation to each to make them seem new every time you hear them.  I've read this book previously and watched the television shows based upon it and I was still able to enjoy it anew as I listened to it this year.<br /><br />The collection of ten Bertie and Wooster stories is typical Wodehouse and a perfect introduction for anyone who has never been exposed to them.  From his first meeting with Jeeves and throughout the remaining nine stories, Bertie comes to rely on his \\"gentlemen's personal gentlemen\\" to get him and his wealthy friends out of a comical assortment of straits...usually involving the female of the species, whether it be a hopeful fiancee or a maiden aunt.  Bertie, no mental strongman in any sense of the word, is hapless when it comes to dealing with these dilemmas but, thankfully, he has the extraordinary Jeeves to save the day.  Though his success sometimes seems unsure and his plans often lead to unexpected - and somewhat disastrous - results, Jeeves is always able to pull his master out of \\"the soup\\" by the end of the story, though it sometimes requires Bertie to give up some favorite (but hideous) piece of clothing of which his manservant most certainly does not approve!<br /><br />Hilarious caricatures, masterful use of language and perfect timing - all signs of classic Wodehouse - are all evident in this delightful collection.  Certainly a recommendation for any long-time lover of Wodehouse or anyone wanting to become addicted to him for the first time!for any long-time lover of Wodehouse or anyone wanting to become addicted to him for the first time!
B00005N6KG|4.0|My last pair of these headphones lasted 8 months before one side went out. I almost wore them daily when exercising so they can got really wet with sweat on most days and stood up to that! I hate earbuds since they hurt my ears and also fall out when I'm doing HIIT workouts and jump around a lot. These fit great in my ear, are secure and they sound great! I'd probably pay more for them but I'm not complaining they're so cheap! Just got my replacement pair and looking forward to at least another 8 months of great music.
B0016KJKIG|5.0|This case is great I had one that i replaced with this one i hope this one is as good as the one i previously had
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author uniquely, morbidly and yet humorously expresses every action of every moment.  It keeps you guessing from beginning till end.  And although one of the characters is malevolent, it's hard not to want to be like the character in some ways.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This one is just as cool as the other two movies.  It's a great movie to watch on a Friday night.
B008478VE8|5.0|Doesn't get any better than this, folks - a true classic, the real deal. Darwin's book is the foundation of all modern biology, so if you can't enjoy &#34;On the Origin of Species,&#34; maybe you just don't like species all that much.
B000001F45|5.0|Loved this &#34;album&#34;  in the seventies and love the CD in the 2000's! Bought it for my husband, the last one  I bought him was ruined when he totaled his truck.
B009LRE040|2.0|I am shocked at how much this movie sucked The script sounded as if it were written by a third grader, trite and predictable. Did every word out of cat woman's mouth have to be a sexual innuendo? It was pure dribble...
B00631VJIC|5.0|Bought this CD for my husband, he loved hard rock and lets face it the &#34;Songs of Anarchy&#34; are hard rock! Love  the  show and the CD!
B006LEHOL2|4.0|For me, the only problem with this album is that it is a bit short. However, while I don't like every single track, the ones that I do are among some of her best.<br /><br />\\"4th & Vine\\" is such a simple love song and yet so powerful and energetic with its funky ethnic/caribbean/gospel arrangements. \\"Take Off Your Shoes\\" is old school \\"The Lion & the Cobra\\" Sin&eacute;ad (think of \\"Never Gets Old\\" and \\"Jackie\\"), talking about where the church really stands regarding Jesus Christ. \\"Back Where You Belong\\" is a track about war, and this album version is more powerful than the languid one featured on \\"The Water Horse\\" soundtrack. Sin&eacute;ad's rock track \\"The Wolf Is Getting Married\\" was an excellent first promotional single, although the promotional video was very disappointing. Finally, you need to listen to the rocking \\"Queen of Denmark\\" (she could've easily written its lyrics), which is her best cover since \\"Nothing Compares to You\\" and even a better version than the original.<br /><br />Apart from \\"Very Far From Home\\", which I don't like at all because the melody seems improvised, I like the other tracks, although I consider that they don't have the power of the ones I mentioned above. I see that \\"Reason With Me \\" often gets mentioned as a highlight on this album (it reminds me of \\"Jealous\\" in terms of melody, which is a good song that, unfortunately, got old quickly for me), but I cannot put my finger on the reason why it is not one of my favorites. \\"I had a Baby\\" and \\"Old Lady\\" are good tracks, but I think there is something missing in their arrangements or production. \\"Old Lady\\" has a catchy chorus but the song finishes sooner than it should have. \\"I Had a Baby\\" has O'Connor's personality but it leaves you with an unfinished feeling when it is over.<br /><br />Has her voice aged? Well, it might be the often mentioned cigarettes, but she's not in her 20's anymore, so I don't know what people are expecting in that sense. Does Sin&eacute;ad still have the fire of 20 years ago? Check out on Youtube the live performances Sin&eacute;ad did of \\"The Wolf Is Getting Married\\", on the Graham Norton Show, and \\"4th & Vine\\", on Later with Jools Holland, to see for yourselves that Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor still rocks!ck out on Youtube the live performances Sinéad did of \\"The Wolf Is Getting Married\\", on the Graham Norton Show, and \\"4th & Vine\\", on Later with Jools Holland, to see for yourselves that Sinéad O'Connor still rocks!

B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is really a great book to read. It was very hard to put down and I enjoyed the reading. Would recommend to friends.
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|The blu-ray itself is fine, the picture and sound quality are as good as it gets.  Even the extras disk is a blu-ray; and this package includes a &#34;digital copy&#34; (why can't they just call it a DVD version?...that's what it is).<br /><br />The movie itself is so-so; of course, the special effects were top-notch, and that's the only really good part.  Unfortunately, I felt it went on about 30-40 minutes too long, and I didn't find any of the characters in the movie interesting.  In that way, it reminded me of the 'Star Wars' Episodes I-III movies, which also lacked anyone that I cared for; in all of these movies, I was hoping that all of these characters would be killed off in the first 15 minutes, so the real stars of the movie would enter.  Never happened.  We were stuck with the same dolts throughout the picture.<br /><br />Also, am I the only one who felt that the characters in 'Prometheus' were almost exactly like the characters in 'Alien vs. Predator', another uninteresting and overcrowded group that you didn't mind seeing killed off one-by-one?<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't call the money I spent on this movie a waste, but this won't find an honored spot in my movie collection, either.  Ridley Scott should have stuck with a regular 'Alien' prequel.  Maybe next time he will.  At least the alien was interesting...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the books. I didn't want them to end. I felt like I was one of the characters. Makes you believe true love still exist.
0785156593|5.0|I've been wanting to read this series since I was young. Back then, we couldn't afford so much such as those. And I can't just buy the old Infinity Gauntlet comics today. That would mean I have to shell out big bucks per comic. I don't know how much the real comic is priced today, but I am glad I can now own one for Marvel made this compilation.<br /><br />I am no comic-book fanatic nor am I an avid collector, but this is definitely one great read and maybe a guide or a refresher to the upcoming movie, The Avengers 2.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I got this for my new Kindle Fire last year, and it's still holding up well.<br /><br />The stand part is just ok - easy to push it over if you're not careful.<br />It's not bulky or heavy, but it protects the Kindle well.<br />I've dropped it from counter height a few times without a problem.<br /><br />The inside is a felt-like soft fabric, which is nice for making sure your screen doesn't get scratched.<br />However, dog and cat hair sticks like mad to it.<br /><br />Buy this along with a lint roller if you have pets!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|The quality overall is excellent. The movie is great and a real pleasure to be able to view it from my video library.

Also, some links provided within an article won't work.

Not fun to go through the process, I just uninstalled instead.

141659521X|5.0|If you like Vince Flynn then you are in for another treat.  The only thing that I am concerned with is when Rapp gets as old as Stan and can no longer do his thing.  That is going to suck.  Hope Vince is working on bringing in a new Mitch-like character and gives us time to appreciate him as much as we do Mr. Rapp. I suppose that goes as well for Irene.
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|Product did not perform as advertised. Was so basd that after an hour I just deleated it and considered it a waste of time and mony. Do not buy

B007HACDLK|5.0|as with the other Mitch Rapp stories, this one is hard to put down  . can't wait till one of these become a movie. the second book  that introduces Mitch would be the best i think.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Rapp book from Vince Flynn.  &#34;The Last Man&#34; was definitely worth the wait.  Full of Rapp doing his thing, &#34;hunting and killing terrorists&#34;.  I, for one, pray that Vince Flynn has many more Mitch Rapp stories left in him.  I will read The Lat Man again soon and eagerly anticipate Flynn's next Rapp novel.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I have learned so much about my own behavior and clearly see how a few bad habits in an organization can and will seperate it from success.  Their is wisdom in the book.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Successfully set up a Brother MFC in another room. Functions at the same speed as when it was next to the computer. What else can I say.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Truly a great mystery, BUT even more I was fascinated by the observations on marriage. The grip of first love, the willingness to do everything our partner wants, the disappointment as we find flaws...it is spot on, though the characters in this story are angry, selfish, and thoughtless...like most of us are. Recognizing our behavior in others always helps us learn.
B000059T1E|5.0|John Barleycorn must die is a combination of modern folk and traditional music.  The original song was a song sung in the Middle Ages by the peasant folk each year.  The folk traditions perserved the tune and Traffic took that old folk song and made it a classic of rock and roll folk music.  It also had a history as a Prohibition and Temporance song as well.
B00705GEP8|5.0|It was my oldest son who introduced me to Sabaton with their song &#34;White Death&#34;, about the Finnish sniper Simo Hayha, and from then on I was hooked. After hearing a couple songs from this album on Youtube (again courtesy of my son), most notably &#34;The Caroleans Prayer&#34; and  the cover of Amon Amarth's &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34;...and FYI--this album is the European import. I felt it had much cooler cover artwork, and teh US version does NOT include &#34;Twilight of the Thunder God&#34;!<br /><br />This album features a very nice booklet with the historical background of each song, and the theme of the album as a whole is the Swedish Empire--heck, I'm half Swedish and I didn't even know there WAS a &#34;Swedish Empire&#34; before this CD!<br /><br />Anyway, I cannot recommend this album highly enough. It is truly Sabaton at their best...and considering how good their stuff before this is, that's saying a lot.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I love this series.  Yes, it is bloody and gory, but it's also got a great plot.  Hot sweaty men fighting.  Love it.
B009A87ZQU|2.0|Not doing much of a review but this movie seemed to drag on and is kind of forgettable.<br />It had a few good scenes but for the most part was predictable and didn't leave much of an impression.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Just like Uno, this one has to grow on me but on the first listen it seems a very good album.<br />Great end for the trilogy and i think if we get 4-5 songs from Uno, Dos, Tre we'll get a F***ING AMAZING ALBUM!<br />For the whole trilogy the vote is : 4,5/5<br />Green Day Rules!
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I actually went out and bought this movie based on what some others said. Didn't see it in the theater. Overall was disappointed, it seemed overly long and drawn out. And it seems movies lately have to be so extreme just to interest the younger movie going crowd. This movie was extreme in its plot and how bad they can make the bad guys. Lets make it so extreme, so hopeless, such overwhelming odds... it takes away from the movie and the characters. Its not the best Batman movie and not even the best super hero movie this year - Avengers was a better movie because it was more interesting. Part of the Batman legacy is how he can outsmart his opponents, and this movie didn't have much of that.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|This is a seriously underrated movie! Milla Jovavich and her costars really make you think in this movie, but the ending will come as a suprise! FIVE STARS!

B008G33OJM|1.0|I ordered the first copy and the original availability date slipped significantly. When I finally received it, I loaded into my Blu-ray player. The credits started, then everything stopped and the player reset. I returned it and Amazon sent me another copy. Same problem. Amazon gave me a full refund and said they would not sell any more until they fixed the problem. Full marks to Amazon for customer service, so one star for them. The product was a waste of time and money. I hope it was just a bad batch.
0316776963|2.0|I'm new to this author and thought he would be funny, but found it to be a little too liberal for my taste. I got through the first few chapters, then donated it.  It wasn't for me - I'm a little too conservative, I think.  If you don't mind potty humor, this book may be good for you.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is my most favorite movie every year for Christmas!  No matter how many times I have watch it over the years, I still laugh.
0061900656|5.0|We bought this book as a &#34;gift&#34; to our son last Christmas.  We asked the grandparents to help him open it and that was how we shared the news of our pregnancy!  It was so fun!

B008DVJOYG|4.0|I can't believe there is only one review of this cd.<br /><br />When i first heard this album in 1987 , I considered it a big disappointment. Looking back this cd matures pretty good . All of side 2 is solid with a couple of good songs on side 1. The song Valentine's day is an emotional masterpiece. The song has the same incredible depth as the song THE RIVER. I never considered Bruce a rocker. His rocker songs seem to drone on with the same beat<br />(there are some exceptions). This same idea applies to Bob Seger<br /> (great emotional songs -- so so rocker songs)<br /><br /> favourite songs include<br />01 thunder road<br />02 jungleland<br />03 the river<br />04 valentine's day<br />05 human touch<br />06 soul driver<br />07 youngstown<br />08 side 2 of his 2nd album<br />09 downbound train<br />10 bobby jean - im on fire<br />11 devil in blue dress (live at nukes rally)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Like all other reviews, won`t update.  On an app as popular as facebook, how does this happen this long after a release?  Who would rate this over a 1?
B009K0P10K|5.0|We just started watching Revenge about a month ago and we instantly became hooked.  We were unaware that Season 2 was currently on the network, so we missed the first four or five episodes.  Thank goodness we came back and purchased them because we would have missed so much action!

B007EECSFA|4.0|This is my 3rd Morton book and I now understand that all her books are pretty much written in the exact same style. I actually liked Forgotten Garden better than this book. I feel like you only get 2 characters who really get developed and then everyone else in the book is just a bystander. I would also have to say that there wasn't a single character in this book who was especially likeable. There were times where I was rolling my eyes wishing Morton would get on with the story. Why does she wait and make all the page turning moments happen after you've read 60% of the book? Her stories are slow. And they stay slow until the end. I guess you have to be in the right frame of mind for that. Lastly, I felt like the story itself was somewhat silly and a real headscratcher at times. I found myself saying \\"Really?\\" to myself a lot of times. There were events that happened in this book that just felt like an easy way to make the story move forward. I guess this review sounds more like a 3 star review but I liked the book enough. I just can't say I would recommend it or read another Morton novel. I feel like she's a one trick pony.
0694003611|5.0|Building baby's library, this is a must have book! Definitely a bedtime story and a great book to use with beginning readers.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As I am progressing in this book, it's gravitational pull on me is increasing.  It starts off with little to grab your attention.  I found myself only staying tuned because of my previous readings of Michael.  I am certain I will reach the end of the story with my usual satisfaction for having read it.  But, this book hasn't, so far, reached the peaks of reading excitement of Michael's other Bosch novels.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|A fantastical blend of vampire cultural norms in a eighteen hundreds setting, spun with a little love drama to boot. Acting and premise worth the money spent.

B004GCPJDQ|4.0|However, I can't get through half of a work day without the batteries dying on me. Yes, I fully charged them before first use.<br /><br />However, otherwise, I have no connectivity issues, never have a problem taking the battery in or out. (Since I have to do this daily in order to make it through my day)<br /><br />Maybe I got a defective battery pack. I have contacted Mobee and will update.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did contact Mobee, and they believe my battery was defective and are mailing me another set. I will update again, but raised a star for GREAT customer response.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|10 minutes of story stretched to an hour and a half. If you like all of Meryl Streep movies, you will probably like this one. Otherwise, you see Tommy Lee Jones as you never want to see him again--as a boring accountant with no romance. The epilogue to the movie showed  him happy, loving, and full of life but we never get to see him make the transformation.<br /><br />Steve Carrell is boring as the marriage counselor. Meryl is Meryl as a 50-year old old maid who happens to be married to Jones and cooks him bacon and eggs every morning. In the highlight of the show, she can't bring herself to perform oral sex on Jones in a theatre, and Jones runs after her telling her that it is no big deal.<br /><br />Just like this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|VF is my favorite author and in his latest book he surpasses his previous efforts. The Last Man is a can't-put-it-down read of Mitch Rapp and his adventures in Afghanistan. The realism of the story is wonderful. The only bad part of VF's books is that I have to wait another year before reading the next one. Great read!
0385335989|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is my favorite author. You must start with the first book - Outlander. I love everything about them. I am an avid reader of many different kinds of books, but non can compare, she is a literary genius. A friend told me about her and her books, it  was the greatest gift I have been given. I started with Outlander and continued on with each book thereafter. Loved them all and this one was no exception. She is an amazing story teller. They make me laugh, cry and I cannot put them down.
0061733199|3.0|This book was a little disappointing as I was looking for more specific information related to hiking and the outdoors. The breadth of coverage is excellent but I didn't need to know how to building igloo shelter in winter. Otherwise, the information is excellent if you're looking for some information about everything instead a lot of information about a few topics.
0345803493|5.0|This book is awesome the plot are great and the author is a wonderful writer. Little or no errors through out the book.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My favorite movie of the year. Maybe not as good as the last one (Tom Hardy did a good job as Bane, but he's no Heath Ledger/Joker). Couldn't wait to get my DVD in the mail. Loved all of the special features too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this trilogy! :D I'm not sure which book I like better though! It's a very tough decision! I think the second book is the best book by far! :)
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is a must! The talent of The Piano Guys amazes me every time I listen to them. Their passion for music is evident in all they do, and we are the lucky ones to have the privilege of having that in our own homes. At first, I just watched their videos on Youtube and listened to their music on my computer. Once I purchased the CD though, to have the music pour from my stereo speakers was incredible! I HIGHLY recommend this CD, for any and all ages.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|Love it!! Glad I bought it!! Need more films like this one!!! The Birtish slang was great usage and the actors were totally fantastic!!
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Very plausible story of an impact of earth.  Good characters, some good moral lessons, some profanity but nothing ultra offensive.  Good enough to watch again and again.
B008JOK59K|5.0|The &#34;anthem&#34; is a great band. Tight melodies and lyrics that stay with you after the music stops. Handwritten is in my openion their best album to date. Two cuts especially, HERE COMES MY MAN & 45 are outstanding! Do get this album!!!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|To hard to figure out.  I played it several times and it seems hard to &#34;get it right&#34; Might try it again before I delete it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This was a fast, easy and enjoyable read. The characters utilize archetypes we already have culturally, so while there is not extensive character development, the story carries it off. The storyline is, at times, a bit predictable and light. But overall, it is well-executed, at times clever and has a thoroughly warm and feel-good ending.
1451695195|4.0|This book is a hard read in the way of the medical jargon used which is not surprising since written by a brain surgeon.  I will definately read a few more times because there are some deep and profound messages in this book that give you and different insight to our world and what exists outside this life.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is the awesome made more awesome! Sharp, clear and self-explanatory. It's Star Wars. All of them. In Blu-Ray. Awesome! :)
B005IQ39AY|4.0|Fun bubble game... Like that it has two types of play. One issue I don't like is you cant swap your bubble for a different color... And last issue is the vibration... eveytime I pop a set, my phone vibrates.. played with all options and can't get it to stop... I hate when it vibrates while I'm playing.<br />Other then that..it's a fun bubble game.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This is a solid game. However, I wish it were a bit more challenging. Nice and varied, though. Excellent graphics and decent storyline.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Since Amazon does not afford me a place to write a review of them I've chosen this product to do so. I ordered this set, along with the boxed Avatar set, as Christmas gifts on November 26 2012. On November 30th I receive an email from Amazon telling me that my order had shipped but when I checked on the tracking information on the 31st it showed that an electronic notification to the carrier USPS had been made and no actual item had shipped. On December 3rd I received an email from Amazon that my order was &#34;undeliverable due to the address I had provide.&#34; The address is the same address they and others have successfully shipped to for over a year. The email stated that I would receive another email giving me two choices to reorder with a correct address or a refund. On December 6th I received an email stating I had been given a refund due to an incorrect address I provided making the order undeliverable. The email had nothing in it about selecting to reorder.<br />On December 11th I saw a local news program that implicated Amazon and several other e-tailors had over sold stock purposely in case there were cancelled orders.<br />Shame on you Amazon for telling me a lie about this order then blaming me for your inability to supply the product you sold me! Since you can no longer deliver to the same address you've been successfully delivering to you will no longer have my business, I'll spend my money locally as I don't deal with liars who blame me for their problems.
0385536828|2.0|In a literary environment where fewer and fewer authors get more and more accolades, this book is guaranteed to stir up the superlatives. As the inside cover tells us, it's the work of 'the supreme novelist of his generation' and an 'unrivalled literary giant.' I wonder if any of the critics whose opinion carries the imprimatur of The New York This and The London That ever think of that modest little story called The Emperor's New Clothes. I'm willing to bet if Sweet Tooth were to be submitted to a dozen publishers as the work of an unknown writer it would be summarily rejected.<br />Having liked some of McEwan's earlier novels. I bought this as an audio book to accompany me on an interstate drive, and oh dear. I've heard of road rage. I got book rage. I was trapped with the thing, in a very small space, and it just went on and on and on.<br />What's the problem? Where to begin?<br />Sterile narrative style. McEwan can write perfectly correct prose stretching ad infinitum, but this stuff is both flat and fake, utterly predictable in its cadences and completely lacking in any sense of personal voice. There's no warmth and no flexibility, no sense of rhythm other than that belonging to the instant mix and match repertoire of formal English prose. Ok, so the narrator/protagonist is a bishop's daughter, someone who is underdeveloped in the personality department, but that's no excuse.<br />Central persona. She just doesn't add up. Supposed to be 'rather gorgeous' and very well educated, with a maths degree from Cambridge, she is passive, confused, cringingly on the lookout for sexual attention and in the habit of picking up male mentors. As a consequence of which she is taken for a complicated succession of rides. It's a sign of poor quality thriller writing if the plot twists can only occur because somebody in the cast list fails to spot the bleeding obvious. Serena just never knows when she is being taken for a ride.<br />The other key characters are even more unprepossessing, especially the supposedly gifted young male writer upon whose work she lavishes the kind of sycophantic praise McEwan is used to receiving from the New York this and the London that. We get to hear a summary of all this guy's stories, each of which is more dismal than the last: exercises in misfired sociology, revolving around sexual encounters that make you wince.<br />As for the writing itself - the text is packed with redundant adjectives and adverbs, gratuitous tautological phrases, lingering descriptions which have no purpose other than to display the author's confidence in his capacity to make the reader's brain glow with admiration at every paragraph...<br />No I haven't got to the end. I'm stopping at the next gas station for whatever pap is on offer. At least it will be honest pap.

B008OOYALE|2.0|I understand that this is a free game, and the developers need to make money somehow.  However, the ads and pop-ups seemed incessant. There were several pop-ups each time you sign on and many more as you continue to play.<br />The concept of the game is sound, but it is slow to progress without buying items. After a couple of weeks, I uninstalled this dragon game and found Dragonvale was available for the Kindle Fire.<br />The animation is cute and well done, but not enough to save this game.
B00A17AD36|5.0|Absolutely love this album!! I would recommend it if you like R&B neo-soul music  - I listen to the whole thing all day long
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Taubes does a nice job of laying out his arguments. It's not fluffy, nor is it a &#34;diet book.&#34; It's a well-argued look at what really makes people get fat.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Harry keeps evolving as a wonderful &#34;real&#34; character.  I love the subtle referenes to early Harry as well as descriptions of Harry as a Father trying to do his best and a lover of jazz.  The plot was updated even if the unfolding of who dunit was a little scripted.<br /><br />Overall, great read.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I have been listening to Green Day for many years and while this is in no way their best album it is still pretty good with a few really strong tracks like &#34;Let Yourself Go,&#34; &#34;Troublemaker,&#34; and &#34;Carpe Diem.&#34; Even the songs I initially found less interesting, like &#34;Kill the DJ&#34; have grown on me, so it is over all a good effort.

B0046W1692|3.0|THis album is not as good as previous spectacular Mana albums.  It's a bit of a hodge-podge of styles, from almost heavy rock, to light breezy songs.  It doesn't flow as an entity very well, and doesn't reflect Mana's amazing talent very well.  I was disappointed, and will continue playing their wonderful older albums instead of this one.

B007FRHZ4A|4.0|My kids have all the Angry Birds set-up games and they love them. Sometimes they use the cards but most often they treat it as a playset, simply building and knocking down. They combine the sets, which are all sized to mix and match.<br /><br />The cards are visual/pictures so even pre-readers can play and the instructions are simple. It's fun to watch the kids working out real-life physics and geometry in order to win at the game.<br /><br />My only complaint about the product is the box. The flimsy cellophane window doesn't hold up well to repeated packing and unpacking so we simply store all our Angry Birds set-up games together.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I don't think I have to review the actual film here. It's not as if most people haven't seen it. But I will say that this film does have it all: lighthearted moments, dramatic scenes, poignant times and lots of hope for the future of Christmas and the characters involved in the story. When asked &#34;What's your favorite movie&#34; I always answer &#34;Miracle on 34th St&#34; without skipping a beat. I love that it's a slice of life from 1947 but is a relevant story for today.<br />This current DVD addition is nice because of the extras, although I really wish that there was a film historian on the commentary along with Maureen O'Hara. I think another person would've prompted her a little more to tell more antidotes, like on the Black Swan DVD commentary. I like the AMC Backstory documentary because it gives an insight to the film's history and some wonderful interviews with people who were in the film.<br />Please don't re-make it again - there's no improving on perfection.
B00062RCBW|1.0|I just started watching these DVDs and the quality is so poor it's hard to imagine anyone actually wanting them.  The episodes are so dark and the colors and picture quality is so poor I don't know what they were thinking.  There are black dark areas all throughout.  I've read other reviews and people have complained about similar problems.  Had I read those first I would have not purchased this at all.  I ordered Deep Space Nine and watched that entire series first with no problems.  Since I have had this set too long to return it I am going to try and contact the manufacturer.  I am pretty sure this isn't a bootleg although it might as well be with the poor quality.  I love the series, but what's the point of owning something you don't want to watch.

B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Movie was great!  definitely believe the rental price isto high for a streamed movie.  The convenience of streaming over going a mile for a Redbox isn't worth the $4 dollar difference in rental price.  Heck, you can buy this movie for $18 bucks at Costco!

B000S9C8M6|3.0|OK, there are admittedly more than 2 listenable songs on this album, but not up to par with At Sixes and Sevens where every song was amazing. The Other Side and Seven Keys and Nine Doors can stand up to the best stuff Morten's EVER done, but the rest just depends on how generous I feel when listening to it. I can't stand Mind's Eye, which unfortunately became the big single for this album, but I could put up with the rest of the album for the sake of getting to the really good stuff. That said, I don't like it enough to spend money on any tracks other than Other Side and Seven Keys. That's the beauty of spottify and MP3 downloads!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Great action and special effects. Nice twist of a fictional story to a great historical figure. The acting was very good and vampires were very unique. My wife prejudged it and figured it would be a &#34;corny&#34; story with terrible acting. I honestly didnt think it would be a great movie but it exceeded my expectations. I believe the director was the same for the movie Wanted, and if so, you could definitely tell with some of the action sequences. I would recommend this movie for anybody he enjoys the vampire genre.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I would recommend this book to all John Grisham fans.  I gave it four stars, as I liked the storyline, but I did not like the spoiler to the twist in the book.

0307744434|5.0|Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Morgenstern delves deep into a world of mystery and intrigue, where contortionists can fit into glass boxes, kittens can flip through hoops and an illusionist can do more than just perform.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: The circus arrives without warning.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Want a plot as complex as a Charles Dickens novel and as creative as Shakespeare? Look no further than Morgenstern's The Night Circus. This magical black and white circus appears at random around the world and only opens at night. But what may seem like a place for entertainment is really a competition arena for two young magicians, Celia and Marco. Each were chosen by a teacher at very young age and were taught two separate techniques on how to manipulate their surroundings. When the time came for the game to start, neither opponent knew who the other was. By accident or by fate, the two meet at a Midnight Dinner (the original planning sessions held by the circus's owner) and fall in love throughout the years while competing against each other. But as the circus grows, other events that could not have been foreseen when the teachers started the competition set off a chain reaction, leading to the possible demise of Celia, Marco, the participants and even the circus itself. Forbidden, innocent and compassionate love combine into a complex and insightful story of manipulation and control, devotion and deceit, and insight and obscurity. Think you know the circus? Guess again.<br /><br />To completely understand my adoration of this book, you must understand that at the same time I was reading this book, I was also reading Othello, The Moor of Venice by Shakespeare in my English class. Now you might think: what does a circus and a Turkish/Venetian war have in common? My answer: absolutely nothing. But the characters and themes in both The Night Circus and Othello are alike in a lot of ways. Both center around manipulation. Both have forbidden love (okay so that might be stretching it in Othello, but hey, Desdemona wasn't supposed to marry Othello). Both have ingenious plots that are so thoroughly thought out, it makes me want to start writing my own book. Since the play and novel were so much alike, I started to love both -- even though I have never been a fan of Shakespeare and was never a fan of circuses either. So thank you Morgenstern for opening my eyes to other literature.<br /><br />Now on to the good stuff: THE CHARACTERS!!! Love. Them. To. Pieces. There are three story lines in this book: yourself walking through the circus, Celia and Marco's competition and Bailey and Poppet and Widget. I was not particularly enthused by the (would you call it a second person? Or one and a half person?) point of view. Granted, it is a nice introduction and ties in nicely with the book, but during the middle of the book it takes away from the anticipation and suspense of the other character arcs. But I see how it's important to the rest of the book, so it makes it a quick read. Celia and Marco's character arcs are impeccable. The only complaint I have is that we don't get to see their relationship develop in the novel. Each chapter is given a date and it usually jumps around from year to year (depending on which point of view the story's in), so Celia and Marco's relationship goes from acknowledging each other to skip a few years later and they're deeply in love. It threw me off when I read it so I had to go back and read to see if I missed a chapter or something. Note to anyone who reads this: watch the dates. They may seem inconsequential in the beginning but they become more important toward the middle. Poppet and Widget are twins that were born just before midnight and just after midnight on opening night of the circus. Widget can see the past and Poppet can see the future. Bailey on the other hand, is just a random farm boy who loves the circus and just happens to be in the right place at the right time. At first when Bailey is first introduced, I didn't like him. He was a naive little kid that got bullied by his older sister (who is a total jerk) into breaking into the circus during the day. But by the end of the book, he was probably one of my favorite characters. He is so driven from all angles from people who want to choose his future for him that he chooses to break off and do his own thing. That's something I appreciate Morgenstern for adding because I too am bombarded with choices and it's hard to decide what I should do. (If only a magical circus appeared in my backyard...)<br /><br />There's so much more I could say on this book, but I'm pretty sure I'm over my word limit (oops!) So my only suggestion is BUY THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Doubleday/Random House provided me with a copy of The Night Circus. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.t the right time. At first when Bailey is first introduced, I didn't like him.

B005LAIHZE|5.0|Fans of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia will get a kick out of Jimmi Simpson's appearance in this movie. This film is every bit as good, powerful, inspiring, and well acted as Spielberg's Lincoln, plus it's got vampires and amazing martial arts. You can't lose! If you can get past the fact that it's a not a comedy, even though the title and premise of the movie promise otherwise, you'll love it. Most vampires in movies are either ridiculously powerful, or have ridiculously exploitable weaknesses. The creators of this movie found just the right balance.

B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Compared with the 1980's Arnold Schwarzenegger version, this has terrific special effects and terrible writing.  I don't understand why you would spend the money for great special effects and an A-List actor like Colin Farrell, an A-List actress like Kate Beckinsale, and then settle for D-Grade writing.  Are good writers so hard to find in Hollywood?<br /><br />Pah!  It is worth watching, once ... maybe.  Rent it, don't buy it.

I love Carrie also but Kelly Clarkson was going through uncharted territory being the first and she has always put out great music time and time again and has not strayed off course with unnecessary skimpy clothing or suggestive lyrics.

0812979656|4.0|If you intend to read this book, you ought to be appraised of the following: The great majority of the events take place over the course of about 4 days, viewed from a distance of 20 years.  This is difficult to sense at first because the time frame jumps around terribly and the space between foreshadowing and flashbacks becomes so fore-shortened and telescoped that it comes as a bit of a \\"eureka\\" moment to remember that the critical events are all occuring a few days apart.  Secondly, you may want to start a chart in the front of the book, as most people find the list of characters difficult to keep straight until you are about 30% done with the book.<br /><br />As for the book itself - it's good.  It's beautiful.  In a well-written fashion it tells a compelling story set in an interesting culture of the crossfire of frustrated human desires that occurs in a single household, and the innocent and not so innocent victims wounded in it.  That is all.

0547564651|5.0|The book is written in a style similar to Malcolm Gladwell's with studies and anecdotes about the people (and the children) who took part in the studies. The author talks about the importance of attachment between mothers and their infants, describes studies of preschool and kindergarten children and the characteristics which predict the children who will grow into happy, successful adults. The importance of these characteristics is emphasized in the high school years and college. This is a book I would recommend to parents, teachers, counselors and all who want children to succeed.

B001G9LVGG|4.0|At time of the year when we rarely acknowledge the sacred, or even the pagan, but instead bow to the commercial, music such as this is a comfort and a relief. The album has very nice traditional Old World quality that is typical of all of Loreena McKennitt's music. If you like her music this album will not disappoint you.
B00A2IUHM6|2.0|It seems that I'm the one of the few that think this movie is not so great. There were a few decent gags, but overall the vulgar sophomoric jokes did not impress me. I've always thought one of things holding Family Guy back is the obtuse and unfamiliar pop culture jokes. Seems to be plenty of that in this movie. I think the idea of the teddy bear is one that worked, and the movie did have some heart. I really think Macfarlane needed some help with the jokes though.
0375869026|5.0|I got this for my grand-neice for an early Christmas gift. I haven't had the chance to deliver it yet but I know she will like it. If possible I will gether to write a review when she reads it.
B000OBYLVO|5.0|Feel good movie or it could just be Cameron Diaz being in it. Seriously ... good mix of characters and stories.
B006H5120E|5.0|I didn't expect the effects of real-d 3-d to be so good since it wasn't filmed in real-d 3-d originally. I was very supprised  that the effects were so great! EXTREMELY GLAD I GOT THIS ONE!!! WELL WORTH ADDING TO MY REAL-D COLLECTION!!! THANKS MUCH!!!!, Donna
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have always been a guy who enjoys throwing a dinner party for friends... But I tend to get flustered if things aren't perfect, and am always running around a little frantic beforehand.  Only a quarter of the way through and I have already learnt several helpful techniques, not to mention enjoying having so many more Slow Carb options to eat.  Now I can save my cheat day for myself, and host dinner on other nights of the week.<br />Warning like all his books he is not exactly a sequential thinker and it show in his writing style.  I strongly encourage you push on through and you will be a chef you never dreamed of!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|BETTER THAN EXPECTED MOVIE WITH LOTS OF ACTION RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING! GREAT ADDITION TO MY SLOWLY GROWING REAL-D COLLECTION!!!
B008YWY0HK|3.0|I started seeing this movie poster a year ago and it looked like something really special that we haven't seen before, a style very ethereal, gothic, a work of art, but when I saw this movie, it was very lame, the story, the animation. I just don't see what audience they are targeting with this movie. I don't see little kids liking this movie and people who like fantasy, gothic style of art and movies, this is nothing like it looks in the poster. I really thought this movie was bad all the way around!
0425263908|5.0|The book is as good or even better than Fifty Shades of Grey.  Very well written.  For people who love hot romance, this is the book for you!

B0049VZ222|4.0|If you haven't seen them yet Amazon and Netflix are the top places to get this season. While the first season isn't the best it's certainly opens up the series great.

B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book is amazing and fascinating...invest the time to read it and see the results in your life immediately. Highly recommend and great as a gift to friends and family.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|With each season the intensity of the stories heightens. This season is no exception. From where we left off in season 2 Season 3 leaves no stone unturned.
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day is an excellent book. It provides clear insight into the life & career of a Navy Seal and the sacrifices these men make to serve and protect our country. Thank you for your service.
B009E3EY38|5.0|One thing was immediately very apparent once I loaded the Blu Ray in the slot and hit play.....The sound quality and picture are absolutely first rate.  Secondly and more importantly, this final performance from Led Zeppelin was as polished as a studio recording yet somehow simultaneously raw in it's delivery and proper Rock and Roll showmanship.  Plant still delivers vocal ability that is still unsurpassed by today's mediocre crooners, along with poses and facial expressions that match each songs carefully crafted delivery. Page still strikes the ultimate pose in each and every song while pulling notes that makes everyone else posers.  JPJones plays keyboards and plays bass with such impeccable perfection that one has to wonder if this was not pre-recorded (which I hope not).  Bonham channels his father like well....Jason Bonham the worlds best hard rock drummer.  I don't need to review the songs on this DVD except to say this is a must own, must buy.  The performance of No Quarter is worth the price of admission alone.  Long live Rock and Roll.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I first got hooked on the book series and decided to try watching the show.  For the most part it sticks to the storyline.  I personally don't care to actually see the genitals of the characters but I realize its an HBO show so it is what it is.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|The Kindle version I read didn't have the illustrations that some reviewers have mentioned, and it obviously didn't have the wonderful binding, but it did have the story the way Dickens wrote it, and that was a joy to read.<br /><br />I've watched many film versions of the story down through the years, and I'd expected to be so familiar with the story that I'd be bored reading it, but the opposite actually happened -- I loved it.<br /><br />I sometimes found myself noticing bits I'd either never seen in the films, or, if I had seen them, I hadn't paid them much mind. Reading the book allowed to take things in at my own pace: if I wanted to pause and think about a particular wording, or if I wanted to back up and re-read something, I did, and it took the experience to a whole new level.  Rather than an abbreviated, two-hour video, I got to enjoy the entire thing and spend as much time as I wanted savoring morsels the video would have glossed over.
B005NFW0U0|3.0|I stopped watching this show during season 3.  It just stopped being interesting for me.  There are too many more interesting shows out there.
0857685627|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he won`t put it down, the art is reallly beautiful. Definitlly a must have for collection.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I love Bones and have been watching it since its inception.  The show doesn't seem to get stale like many shows do after this many seasons.  The show doesn't really have much correlation to the books that its based on but its still great!
1608862801|5.0|The art is excellent, and the story is fun and silly--which is in keeping with the show. Don't overlook the author's comments on the bottoms of some of the pages in pale green text. Ryan North is a funny dude.
B004498KPU|5.0|I love this DVD, I got it for my little brother because he is a huge Michael Jackson fan. And now we have all his music videos to cherish and remember him by.:)) We are very happy to have this DVD and recommend every Michael Jackson fan who doesn't have this to get it:)
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I loved this book. It taught me so many things about myself and the people around me. I suggest this to everyone!!!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Being a big Kate Morton fan I had been eagerly awaiting the release of this latest book.  I was not disappointed and as usual thoroughly enjoyed and was drawn into the lives of the subjects.<br /><br />The ending was a surprise, which I probably should have seen coming, but didn't whilst engrossed in the storyline.  Can't wait for the next from  this author.
B007XF0X6G|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because I thoroughly enjoyed the 3D effects. During one scene, it looked like the winged horse came into the action from my living room coffee table, and that's several feet from the TV. The story was ok, typical &#34;Titans&#34; fantasy. I enjoyed it. Recommend it if you enjoy mythology and 3D.
B006PERRMY|5.0|Not that I love Justin Timberlake's lack of acting skills but the photography, the simplicity of the imagery and the brilliant playing out of the theme, so clever.  So... timely? Time is money and money is life.  Minute Men are mobsters.  Time Keepers are law enforcement. I love the scene where he wakes up in his luxury hotel room in New Greenwich and looks at his arm, his time, and doesn't jump out of bed for the first time in his life because he doesn't have to.  I predict it will become a cult classic, maybe even a remake with a real actor.
B00006D295|5.0|Who cannot resist doing the time warp with Tim Curry?  This is an epic cult classic from 1975, and it will remain timeless!
B009O07NDY|5.0|This Special Edition of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey's soundtrack contains two CDs with 32 tracks, four of them exclusive to this edition and six others extended versions.  It is packaged in a very handsome dark red slipcase with nice maps of northern Middle-earth decorating the interior, along with an interesting paperbound insertion by Doug Adams, author of The Music of the Lord of the Rings films, describing the music and including some of the lyrics.<br /><br />Howard Shore's beautiful music hearkens back in many ways to the masterpieces he created for the three Lord of the Rings films.  I found the selections dealing with Bilbo and the other hobbits in the Shire the most beguiling, as I did the tracks for Rivendell and the White Council, which are suitably ethereal.  The music for the darker scenes involving orcs, the Necromancer, and especially Gollum is much darker and more foreboding.  Perhaps the most enigmatic track is the one for Radagast the Brown, a wizard who is only mentioned in the book but who is to play a significant role in the films.  Perhaps because I haven't seen the movie yet I was unable to sufficiently picture the wizard from his theme music, but that only whets my appetite.<br /><br />There are two songs taken directly from Tolkien's own words: \\"Blunt the Knives\\" and \\"Misty Mountains\\", both performed by the Dwarf cast. I was disappointed that the last \\"punch\\" line of \\"Blunt the Knives\\" was left out, and that only part of \\"Misty Mountains\\" was included. Nevertheless I felt both conveyed much of the spirit of the book, as did \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain,\\" a new composition.<br /><br />While no film or musical composition can ever sufficiently convey all the magic of Tolkien's world the way the books do, I did enjoy this Special Edition, as I will enjoy the movie, as an imperfect but lovely depiction of a marvelous sub-creation.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|This movie is NOT for children, but if you are an adult who enjoys sketchy comedies, this movie is for you!  Contains nudity, and explicit sexual acts, but it is hilarious at every turn!
0062127241|3.0|I found this book sometimes engaging (especially the first half), sometimes touching, and generally worth reading. But it also left me quite puzzled, both by the lack of musical detail about some of the most powerful music in rock history and also by the inclusion of so many irrelevant and trivial details about life as a wealthy, philandering rock star.<br /><br />The missing musical detail is especially pronounced when this book is compared, inevitably, to Keith Richards' richly-detailed memoir, which is so full of musical insights. Townshend builds up the story nicely through the Tommy and Woodstock years, but then fails disastrously when he reaches Who's Next, making very little effort at all to explain the process that led to what many consider to be one of the greatest rock albums.<br /><br />It's really inexplicable how he could think readers wouldn't feel short-changed by the lack of musical detail and insight about how and why Who's Next came into being. Perhaps this is because that album was constructed from the ashes of another overly-ambitious project, Lifehouse, that didn't get off the ground, and Townshend's bitterness about having that project thwarted prevents him from wanting to say anything interesting about Who's Next. But that doesn't diminish the glaring gap in the book's musical narrative.<br /><br />Ironically, Townshend recently  told a New York Times interviewer that he wished Keith Richards had written his memoirs by himself instead of with the assistance of James Fox(11/29/2012 NYT Book Review). However, perhaps if Townshend had written his book with some more editorial assistance, he could have been convinced to provide more insights about his music and less of the \\"day in the life of an aging, self-absorbed rock star\\" trivia that makes up too much of the last third of this book. For example, on page 456, the first paragraph starts \\"I flew to Miami to spend a few days with [former girlfriend] Lisa to achieve closure, a desire stemming from her psychoanalysis.\\" The next paragraph starts \\"I flew to Courchevel to watch [son] Joseph take his first skiing lesson. I actually chartered a plane from London to Chambery and a helicopter from there to get in and out.\\" All this irrelevant trivia (and, yes, there's much more like it), yet next to nothing about how Who's Next was recorded and written? I finished the book puzzled by this striking imbalance between musical insight and personal trivia.<br /><br />And, yet, I did feel at the end that I knew quite a bit more about Pete Townshend as a person than I did before, and he comes across as a generally good person despite (and on occasion because of) his personal flaws and struggles. He has certainly been a hard worker (maybe even to excess), an innovative musician, a caring father (though not a good husband!), a good friend to his fellow rock stars, and generous to charities. But I was expecting and hoping to have learned more detail about Townshend the musician and how that contributed to and shaped one of the most innovative rock bands.her psychoanalysis.\\" The next paragraph starts \\"I flew to Courchevel to watch [son] Joseph take his first skiing lesson.

0062197258|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  As an avid reader I found this one hard to put down and carried the book around with me to read snatches at a time.  A real page turner.  The shift in past to present every other chapter was a fantastic way to keep you wanting more.  It makes you wonder what is realy happening to our friends and neighbors that we have no suspision of.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|When we first got the cd we listened to it over and over in the car. My kids love Cello Wars. My 3 yr. old laughs hysterically every time when vadars accordion bit comes on. They also watch the you tube videos all the time. We love the Piano Guys!
B0009P5YXO|3.0|This was a bit of a impulse buy for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift. I read a few reviews but not closely. Its a great toy and is the ability to write in invisible ink is cool. Though I'd have to say I was expecting a little higher of quality of plastic. This would make a better gift for a younger WHO fan. Its defiantly a good gift for a younger person who is less picky about quality. It defiantly be cool for secret notes. Its a great gift just not for an adult.

B006LSZECO|5.0|i really enjoyed this book because its a lot different then the average mystery/suspense story. you definitely get hooked into reading it. I plan to see what else this author has written bc i enjoyed the smart style and off-the-beaten-path plot.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This is a fun game. I play it on two different products. The game keeps your progress on each platform. What I did not like is to use this on the Kindle Fire is you have to log in to Facebook. It would be a five with out the Facebook requirement.
B009L7MD44|4.0|[[ASIN:B009L7MD44 HyperDrive iUSBport Wi-Fi - Makes Any USB Storage Device Wireless - Black]]<br />I have wanted to use my iPad as my only computer on trips with my camera, but since I may shoot up to 100 GB of pictures, backup storage was a problem. I have a couple of 500GB drives and a Camera Connection kit to download pictures from the camera to the iPad, but how to complete the transfer to the drive was the question.  Seagate has a 500GB drive with wifi connection to the iPad, but I didn't want to pay twice for a drive. I read about this item in \\"The iPad for Photographers\\" ($9.00 Kindle), but it was just introduced at that time.  I ordered one on Friday and received it by mail on Monday.<br />There is an iOS app available in the App Store that is mounted on the iPad.  It will also work with the iOS PhotoSync app and any FTP app, such as FTPOnTheGo.<br />The device includes a quick start guide and a power cord, which plugs into an Ipad power supply or similar 5v 2amp source. There are some complaints that a full adapter isn't supplied, but I think this was a smart idea. Anyone would have the iPad adapter and this saves money and eliminates another thing to carry.<br />When I turned it on,it worked instantly with the Safari browser on my iPad and I could easily browse the attached disk. You need to remember each time to use the Settings app in the iPad to connect the iPad to the iUSBport wifi signal, particularly if you have another local wifi (such as your home) normally remembered.<br />It took a little while to get it to work properly with the app and I had to ask a question about how to transfer files, but received prompt answers from Kelvin in customer support. He plans to make a video showing how to use the app to transfer files.  This is one deficiency in the device in that there is no documentation of use with the app. Hopefully the video will rectify that.<br /><br />In summary, I have been able to transfer files back and forth between my iPad and the Seagate 500GB drive and feel that my requirement for expanded remote storage of images from the iPad has been met.agate 500GB drive and feel that my requirement for expanded remote storage of images from the iPad has been met.
B0041VT6HW|5.0|If you like action  this is for you. I am not a movie critic so I can not comment on the story but I thought that the acting was smooth and fkowed well with the exception of one line. John Malcovicz(?) play a great villian.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was fantastic! I fell right into the story of Henrietta and her family. Who would have thought I could enjoy a science book...a book about cells? Henrietta's story is tragic. I found myself frustrated and heart-broken over and over. Most importantly, I learned something here about 'progress' and will think differently because of it. The next time I take my children in for immunizations, or require a medical test of some sort, I'm going to take a minute and thank Henrietta Lacks.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I fould the movie interesting. The idea is novel and the acting flows smoothly. It was not a bad choice for just a wild chance for entertainment.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|The setting and feel of this movie reminded me a bit of Peter Jackson's treatment of Lord of the Rings. The scenery was fantastic. It is an interesting take on the Snow White tale. Kristen Stewart as Snow White, although obviously central to the story, didn't have much of a speaking part. The evil queen and her back story are what really make this film worth seeing.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|The app is easy to use and has a lot of power but there are words it cannot give you information on when in the speak mode.

B0046B4VXQ|3.0|I think many a teenager has seen this original version of Stephen Kings Carrie and which they had those mental powers that Carrie does.<br /><br />A classic movie that does not focus on the gore and one of John Travolta's early appearances.I think the most horrifying thing in this movie though is Carrie's over the top religious mother.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Not as great as all the fuss. I was more impressed with Channing's actual dancing than anything else.<br />The acting was not good at all for such great actors
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This is an extremely interesting read. Lots of history couched in a very personal look at all the players of the time.

She's giggling like a school girl. Its really bloody sappy<br /><br />Within pages you have got 2 idiots trying to convince us that they are in love.<br /><br />I'm kind of getting annoyed at YA books and books like this that don't convey relationships<br /><br />Sure you have only 300 pages to get across that they fall in love and you don't want to save it to the last 100 pages but seriously!..<br /><br />People are resistant<br />People don't just let people stroke their face that they just met<br /><br />It's not believable.<br /><br />I have a funny feeling the 5.0 ratings are from the publisher who paid reviewers to write reviews. In fact if you go through their profiles you can see they have links to review sites.<br /><br />MASSIVE FALIURE<br /><br />I gave up on the book after 3 chapters. I am not one for reading on and on if its crap. I have better things to do with my time.
B004XNPQUO|3.0|An interesting app that displays the laws of physics. Interesting options. I would have given it a five it it would not be a phone only app, unworthy of the limited and precious internal memory.

B004NS710C|5.0|So intense, was over before you realized you were holding your breath.  One of Denzel's best movies since Bone Collector
B00975L81Y|5.0|After a few years of, in my opinion, CoF albums that were lacking (due partly to Sara Jezebel Devas absence from the band), They're back with a better brutal sound that doesn't sound like they just threw it together over the weekend to sell some records.  Although SJD isn't in this album either they have brought back an almost Midianish sound, and I definately recommend it to CoF fans.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|An excelent Kinfe, especially for the price paid for it, Blade is not too long and the Kinfe is a full 1/4 inch thick of high carbon steel. It is great for chopping, batoning, food production and other jobs around the camp. I highly recommend this kinfe to any outdoor enthusist and especially for those intersted in Wilderness Survival.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|I really liked this movie, the characters reminded me of my own family which made us all laugh.<br /><br />There is one part that is pretty morbid but no doubt it has happened in America history but it goes well with the story so I don't really see it as being a CON.<br /><br />I kept my review non specific so not to give any spoilers.

They corrected the slip case issue but who ever is packing them is not checking to see if anything is flying around in the cases .3 sets all broken . Anyway i gave it 4 starts becuase just from the reviews yet i have not been able to watch any cause i keep returning them , I will not play $150 for broken merchandise . So with this really low price be warned about the issues . They told me it may go under review again .
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful. Recommended by a very good reader friend and I downloaded the omnibus at lunch on Saturday and just finished it with snatches of time here and there. At one point, it was so dark and hopeless that I was severely depressed and human nature at its worst seemed as if it would prevail. Stay with it, a thoroughly delightful read, well tied up. Welcome to a new star in the SF business!
B001VIMCW4|4.0|Fun movie, grabs you right at beginning and doesn't let you go....Daniel is good but he isn't Sean. OK for kids.

B006MHWXMS|5.0|This thing is as close to perfect as you can get. I use it to track pretty much every activity possible. Shopping list? Done. Trip checklist? Done. Project step checklist? Done. I even use it to keep track of our wine list. Setting alarms for tasks, even repetitive ones is as simple as a few taps. And it all gets synched to Google Tasks automatically. This thing is perfect. Highly recommend.
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|I am a Godfather junkie, so I bought the book to see how well the movie followed the book.  The movie is faithful to the book and even has a few extra situations that were not covered in the movie that were interesting.
0375842209|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. I cried and laughed throughout. This story shows how there is always so much good in the world, no matter how evil and dark it may seem. I couldn't put this book down. Excellent writing and excellent storytelling. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My daughter recommended the book to me when I told her that I was going to see the movie.  I couldn't put the book down.  Now I can't wait to see the movie to see how they handle the ending.
B006O6EOII|4.0|I collect Monster High dolls, but only the economy line ones. That said, I was not too enthused about the Roller Maze set of dolls, because I didn't really care for the added green streaks in their hair and the helmet/skating accessories. But then I had a chance to get this doll for a ridiculously low price... so I got her.<br /><br />In person, she is much more loveable than she appears online. I naturally tossed the helmet in my drawer of toy accessories that I'll probably never look at again (I really dislike it - and it would never fit over the pigtails on my particular doll, anyway). Her dress doesn't really \\"match\\" her hair/accessories very well, either. My doll also had lopsided pigtails that looked like they were styled to go in totally different directions.<br /><br />However, the basics of this doll are more pleasing than I expected. Her face makeup is very flattering behind those green sunglasses - and my doll is perfectly painted. The green streaks actually work very well with Ghoulia's usual blue hair - and even provide the opportunity for some creative color-based hairstyles (I trimmed a lock of green in the front to make a face-framing tendril and it's absolutely adorable). Her hair can easily be styled out of the pigtails if yours comes crooked, like mine did.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm having more fun with this doll than with many of the others. I think because I'm not as attached to her original styling, I'm more willing to tinker with her and restyle her to fit my needs - something I don't normally do with my MH dolls.<br /><br />This Ghoulia comes with a stand, but no brush (well, most girls and toy collectors have enough of those, anyway).

B004FRX0MY|4.0|I really like this app. It has a lot of great features. I really enjoy the option of playing the music directly on the app, as well as downloading the music to your device. I actually use another app for playing the majority of my music on my phone, so the ability to download the music is great! And it downloads in a generic file type so that it is compatible with other programs.<br /><br />Amazon also offers the same app for download to your computer. That app is excellent! It offers the option to download and automatically add to iTunes.

B004W4N55C|5.0|As a beginning guitar player, I have searched for websites that offer guitar tabs for all of my favorite songs. I finally settled on Ultimate Guitar as my favorite. They had a seemingly endless supply of great tabs for all skill levels. I stumbled across this app when it was the Free App of the Day. Since downloading it, I use it constantly when I play guitar. There are numerous features that are extremely helpful. One that I LOVE is the auto-scroll feature. I hate having to stop in the middle of playing a song to scroll down on my phone, but with the variable speed auto-scroll, I can play continuously. The app allows you to save your favorite songs and pull them up with the click of a button. This is very handy as there are numerous tabs to choose from for each song and finding the exact one you liked best can be tedious. As stated previously, the song choices are fantastic. Some of the more popular songs even have little snippets of the song to familiarize yourself with it.<br /><br />Another feature that sets this app apart is the guitar tuner. It actually works very well. It uses the microphone (which you can adjust the sensitivity to get the best tune). It allows you to tune your guitar in standard (EADGBE) as well as drop D (DADGBE) and many others.<br /><br />Overall, this app is awesome. Although I did get it for free, I would definitely have paid for it and would recommend it to anyone who plays the guitar and uses tabs.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This game is cute, with the pigs from Angry Birds as your stars! My son (7) really enjoys building contraptions in this game to see what works and what doesn't. Overall, not bad and easy to use even for the kiddo.
B005NPCBI6|5.0|I don't know anything about the history of Pink Floyd, nor do I care to. I recognize great music when I hear it. This is great music.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Neil Gaiman delivers interesting characters with intricate webs of connection between the characters. It was a really fun and interesting read with some great twists!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Works on galaxy S3. Can't say I have any complaints yet. The widget did not work well the first time I used it, but once I reinstalled it, it worked just fine.

B003IKMR0U|5.0|I found this game to be enjoyable and would play it again. I did end up having to use some elmer's glue on the bottom cover for the dice cup; I hope it holds.<br /><br />I found this other dice game that comes with 50 brains already and is priced much cheaper than other brain counter options that I have seen: [[ASIN:B000N20AH8 Reiner Knizia's Mmm...Brains!]]<br /><br />It has 25 white brains that are supposed to represent 1 brain each, and 25 red brains that represent 5 brains each. I guess using the red brains to represent 5 brains would make counting up the brains a no-brainer. :P<br /><br />You can find more details about that game here:<br />[...]
0399160450|3.0|The last few Clancy novels haven't been quite the same as his early ones.  With this one, it is very evident that the only thing that this shares with his early novels is the name.  Mr. Greaney has done a decent job with the last one (Locked On) but this one has a couple of errors that are hard to ignore for die hard Clancy fans.  First, it's mentioned that Jack Ryan Jr. is the eldest child of Jack Sr.  If that's the case, what happened to Sally?  Also, Ding's son, Clark's grandson, was given the name John Conor Chavez in the Rainbow Six novel.  In Threat Vector he's referred to as John Patrick Chavez.  We should all know that Seniors middle name is Patrick (Sir John Patrick Ryan).  Those simple yet huge mistakes should never have made it into the novel.  It's one thing if the inconsistencies were with non-regular characters but everyone knows that Ding and now Junior are major characters in the Ryanverse.
B005F3XV62|3.0|The film has a few funny moments, but the most entertaining moments were shown in the trailer. It's worth watching, but not necessarily worth buying... only reason I bought it is because my dad loved it and it's a Christmas gift for him.
B000I9YWDO|5.0|This is a great office comedy even if you don't work in an office it is sure to make you laugh!

B0072GPPNC|5.0|5 stars is not enough..This one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.  It has a great plot/story and it keeps moving right along.  Almost brought a tear to my eye when he finally found his horse during the war and at the end when he arrived home after the war.  You must see this movie..especially if you love horses..
0785162348|5.0|Assemble!<br />Every Avengers fan must have this incredible art book. The page with the Hawkeye's arrows is simply amazing and a show apart.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very good book!! Lots of twists and turns! Would highly recommend this book! I plan to read more books by this author!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I cannot say more emphatically how GREAT this album is! I'm one to get bored with music easily, but I've been listening to this album non-stop for about 3 weeks & I still can't get enough of it. I'm also not one for classical music.... I have tried in the past to like it in an effort to be more \\"cultured\\" but to no avail, ....however, The Piano Guys' music has changed that. They combine classical with modern music in a way that is thoroughly entertaining. Jon Schmidt is AMAZING on the piano & Steven Sharp Nelson has succeeded in making the cello my favorite instrument.<br /><br />We have young boys & they love listening to this c.d. in the car (which I am thrilled about). Their favorite is the Star Wars song, which makes them laugh (if you've seen the You Tube video, you'll understand). Their music is perfect for all ages!<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this album!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Book was well written which made it hard to put down. No military secrets were revealed which was a concerned for me if they had been.
1449410243|5.0|I have loved The Oatmeal's comics for many a year, and have purchased several wonderful items from the website including some fantastic stickers and 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth (And Other Useful Guides).<br /><br />I actually bought two copies of this book as Christmas presents for fellow The Oatmeal fans (my boyfriend and sister), and I know they're going to love them! This book stays true to the inappropriate, hilarious and awesome style of all the The Oatmeal comics many internet dwellers have come to love.<br /><br />This is not a book for children. Adult humor! Don't be dumb and order it all &#34;oooh my grandson will love a book about kitties!&#34; On second thought, order it anyway.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to anyone who enjoys tear-inducing laughter, suspects their cat of being an evil genius, and doesn't take him or her self too seriously.
B008N2Z1L0|4.0|Showing more spunk than would be expected after a seven year hiatus, \\"Glad All Over\\" finds The Wallflowers rocking harder than probably any of their previous albums. Especially after the neo-folk of Jakob Dylan's pair of solo cd's, this is an unexpected surprise and delight. Adding to the jet fuel is drummer Jack Irons (late of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Mick Jones guesting on two rather Clash like songs. \\"Glad All Over\\" is shaking all around with a triumphant feeling.<br /><br />\\"Reboot The Mission\\" they snap on the best song here. With Jones adding back-up vocals, it's Casbah pleasing rock. That's not all the band has up their sleeve, though. The frantic opener \\"Hospital for Sinners\\" sounds wickedly fun, even a little sinister. Same with the piano pounding \\"Devil's Waltz.\\" If you're looking for the \\"One Headlight\\" clone, the closest it the disc's closer \\"One Set of Wings.\\" But this is an album that punches harder than the old songs. The band sounds absolutely revitalized, and that makes \\"Glad All Over\\" a really good album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Oh my gosh what a way to end!! I'm sooooooo excited for 2013!!! Darn you Rick Riordan, why do you write such such AMAZING books!!!! :)
B0085RQLXK|3.0|The newest incarnation of Aerosmith (it's been a decade since \\"Just Push Play\\") finds them almost in a parallel universe with the Rolling Stones. \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" is a confident and competent album, but no great shakes in the pantheon of Aerosmith. Like the Stones, they seem incapable of cutting a truly bad album in their golden years, but anyone expecting \\"Rocks\\" is stuck in a dimension all their own.<br /><br />You're also stuck with the outside songwriter syndrome, with Desmond Child, Jim Vallance, Diane Warren and M. Moir (is that Monte Moir of The Time?) all sharing creidts with the Aerosmith members. As usual, the Warren ballad \\"We All Fall Down\\" is commercial knockout (I'm going to bet on this as the single), while the Jim Vallance number \\"Legendary Child\\" is actually one of the better cuts. However, it's the Tyler/Perry songs that are the meat of \\"Dimension.\\" The opener \\"Love XXX\\" is better than anything on \\"Just Push Play,\\" and Tom Hamilton's \\"Tell Me\\" is an acoustic standout.<br /><br />The lone curveball is the duet with country superstar Carrie Underwood. \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" sounds like a song from the \\"Pump\\" period, even with Underwood's considerable pipes chiming in. It doesn't necessarily 'rock,' but it's no Nashville weeper, either. Add a bonus song from Joe Perry singing \\"Freedom Fighter\\" and you round out a decent Aerosmith album. \\"Music From Another Dimension\\" isn't going to convert any old fans, but at least it's not \\"Done With Mirrors.\\"
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|So. Much. Innuendo. It was hilarious. My friends and I could not stop laughing. Cary Grant is the date-rape angel.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|I am really thrilled that I purchased this CD.  David Guetta is a very talented DJ with his sick beats and he knows how to choose the best talent to sing his songs.  I love every song on the CD and I jam to it all day everyday. Get it!
B0045HCJT4|1.0|We love this movie and it was listed as 1:77 in size. When we recieved  it  the size was 2:35. This is call bait and switch. Shoppers don,t buy this movie  unless you want to watch the movie with the heads cut off .
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|I was so very excited and was waiting patiently for Rihanna to release her new CD.  Ok, the cd is finally here, but I was not totally taken aback when I heard it.  The first run through was ok and I was thinking to myself that I had made a mistake.  Normally, when I listen to a Rihanna CD, I fall in love instantly on the first listen, however, this time was not so.  I have had this cd for about 3 weeks now and it has grown on me.  I am not in love with it, but I like it a lot.  The song &#34;Diamonds&#34; is a great song but I just don't think it belongs on this album.  &#34;Aint nobody's bidness&#34; with Chris Brown is a total knock out!  I love this song and agree with the lyrics.  I love this album sometimes and I don't like it sometimes because I felt that some of the songs feel forced and were not thought out well.  Rihanna, take a break.  You have been working hard for the last seven years.  You will still come back to reclaim the #1 spot on the charts, so don't be afraid to take a break and regroup.  On the whole, the cd is good, but not great.
0545265355|5.0|The packaging was a little dented but the books were fine.  The series was womderful - wasn't thrilled with the ending, but not every story ends like Cinderella!  Wonder what she comes up with next!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love lying in bed and playing solitaire on my kindle. This is a great game and easy to play.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very realistic fantasy show, great actors and awesome scenery. the plot is thick and no episode was ever dull, great show!

B008IJTFYW|5.0|tons of options! and we love the custom favorited you can save. great white noise in the form of spa background music
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great Plot and Action. Actors and actresses were great! It's a must see movie! Chris Nolan has done it again.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was so fun to read.  It had twists and turns and suspense, everything that makes a book great.  Great for kids and adults too.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I was a young adult during the soap this is taken from and I loved the parody of it.  Johnny Depp is awesome.

B000AY74OG|5.0|I bought the dvd used for my daughter because it was so much cheaper that way. she loves it!!!!!! very cute movie and not a scratch on it!
B00A77II0U|4.0|The game has a unique storyline but was a bit predictable. In order to proceed with certain parts of the game, you have to solve other challenges, which is important to me. For example, in order to uncover a clue, you need to find paint thinner to add to paints you already found which requires entrance to another part of the game first. Wish it was longer!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This was a hilarious movie! I had heard good things about it from friends but had never seen it while it was out in the local movie theaters. I was happy to have the chance to finally see it and now I see what people were talking about. I was sent a copy of this to view and found that the movie itself was very funny with witty lines and characters that were memorable. As always the Blu-ray quality was superb and the music in this rocked! As someone who loves to sing, I can tell you that the people that you find to sing with can become a family like you see in this movie. While the plot is somewhat predictable, it is a family friendly movie that will leave your tows tapping and a smile on your face (or at least it did mine).
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I really like this movie. I'm looking forward sequel..... if there is one.  Great story, action, drama, etc.  I already watched it a second time
B002OFWG7E|2.0|i had hoped for more.  One or two good songs, but I am mostly unimpressed.  If you've heard a few of their songs on the radio then you've already heard their best work and you should just buy those few songs individually.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I absolutely love this movie - It is Christmas! The music, the scenes, the jokes! Plus the fact Ralphies is in it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son is 6 and plays Angry birds star wars everyday. We have not had any trouble with the app. Though I did  figure out quickly how the parent controls worked after he ordered some new ships. I have this app for my kindle fire and Samsung galaxy 3.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is what every puzzle game should be. Runs smooth on my Galaxy S3, no bugs, gets progressively harder (within reason), and is pleasing to view. Nice sequel. I would but another one if it came out.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following the Piano Guys on YouTube for quite a while. Their videos are awesome and the sound of their music is fresh! They have an incredible team working together to make their music excellent, and I was ecstatic when they were finally signed by Sony! It's about time a recording company paid attention to what so many on YouTube and Facebook already knew. I ordered the CD as soon as it was available, and it hasn't left the CD player in my car since I got it.
B004J64QSI|5.0|If you are a fan of Les Miserables -- this is a must-get. If you are not a fan, then there is no help for you. That is all. I initially watched this special on PBS, and watched it again, and again. It is pricessless. The shear love in the audience, and by the cast of hundereds stands embodies everything this musical represents. Well staged. Well shot. Must get.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw the movie and just thought Rodriguez was amazing.  I love Dylan and he has that same sort of &#34;message&#34; sound.  I have told everyone to see the movie and to get the records!
B009WJ14FA|5.0|Impressive debut disc from a really refreshing band. In a time where music has gone stale, these guys go back to the basics and drop a musical bomb on us that is so energetic, and so much fun to listen to. You get absorbed into the beat, the playing and the singing. I'm not going to get into every song detail. There's no bad track on the disc. It's worth the purchase price for the hours and hours of ear candy.
B009K45Y62|3.0|I had ordered this when it became available for per-order many months ago and when it finally did arrive I was looking forward to finally watching this amazing film at home. Well come to find out when I got home and opened it up I had 2 special feature disks and an inferior DVD copy of the movie. I know this is a WB issue and not an amazon issue and it is not just occurring in the special box edition either as it has occurred in the Dark Knight Trilogy Blu0Ray set as well. It seems that WB has really dropped the ball on product and control in what ever stamping factory outside of the US they are using. I refuse to send back this edition on the grounds that there are no more available and I would not be receiving a proper replacement as only 35,000 of these exist. I'm going to try my hand at contacting WB on this issue and will upgrade my rating if it all goes through with no issues but at this time I cannot under any circumstance give this the proper rating it would deserve if the issue had not arisen.<br /><br />Update:<br />I was successful in getting a reply back from WB and they will take of any issues involving double special feature disks by sending you a pre paid envelope to return the extra disk back in with and then they will send you the blu-ray when they receive the extra disk. I have just received the email confirming that they saw my request and I gave the needed info to receive the return label so once I finally get the disk I will give this product the five stars it deserves but until then it will recieve only 3  stars.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|With an ambitious task of writing and releasing three brand new albums, I feel like Green Day wrapped it up quite nicely with Tre. The way that Billie described each album is spot on, and each album has their own storyline and vibe. I think it was a fun experience for the fans to listen to, and for the guys to write and record.<br /><br />Green Day did a knockout job with Tre. The album was a lot of fun to listen to. Since the only that carries the album in my small college town is Walmart, it was already censored. So I drove the 40+ miles to get the uncensored version (As I did with the other two). Listening on the way back I found myself jamming to just about every track. 'Brutal Love' is a phenomenal opening to the record, with it's Doo-Wop feel and swaying rhythm. 'Missing You' is a nice little track, with a fun beat that feels great, and is rather upbeat. '8th Avenue Serenade' is another upbeat track, and one of my personal favorites. 'Drama Queen' has a nice happy melody, with some rather strange lyrics, but is a really good song after getting used to the lyrics. 'X-Kid' is another great track, and in my opinion is worthy of being a single. 'Sex, Drugs & Violence' is a fast paced song that could have fit on Uno! as well. 'A little boy named Train' takes some getting used to, but turns into a nice soothing little song. The next two, 'Amanda' and 'Walk Away' are both good songs, and Walk Away gives off a different vibe, about walking away from things. 'Dirty Rotten Bastards' is one of the best Green Day songs that I have EVER listened to. It's such a fun track, and is 6 minutes of great Green Day. Followed up immediately by another great track '99 Revolutions'. This song is another great song by Green Day. Wrapping up with 'The Forgotten', it's a nice piece of work, through and through.<br /><br />Overall, this album definitely pushed Green Day forward as musicians and artists. I sincerely hope that this isn't the end of Green Day, as they are moving in a greatdirection. If you love punk, pop, and Green Day, this is a must buy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the ending because one's heart can be softened.  It just takes the right person to soften it.  You realize that one can fall in love without all the drama.  The sex made it interesting because it was &#34;freaky&#34;.  At the end it turned into lovemaking and not just sex.
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I bought this just to hear Steve Morse, but it is a great vocal album with good songs. Another reviewer summed it up as a good mix without anyone trying to steal the show.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app it is so helpful I use it for every thing I don't know what my life would be like with out it
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This is the best CD I have heard this year. The song mix is diverse  and each is compelling. The humor in Analog Man and Fishbone are  fantastic, but the from the heart feeling in the songs about family, success, and addiction are marvelous. And as an added bonus, his guitar work absolutely rocks!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton's writing is wonderful! I love how she moves back in forth in time. The ending in this book was a total surprise!

B0058YPGL6|5.0|This show caught me by surprise.  I thought it would be dopey, but I really loved it.  The minimalist approach to the werewolf effects is a smart choice.  Still a little on a cheesy-side but it could be a lot worse.  The characters are perfectly casted.  What I really like is the story.  Most shows bore me because I can predict plot turns a mile ahead.  Teen Wolf season one has some genuine suspense that caught me off guard and the story went in directions I could never have predicted.  Well done.<br /><br />Season two is good, but not great.
0547884591|3.0|I have read Tim Ferris' blog since the beginning, and I own all of his books. Big fan, you might say.<br />Nevertheless, I am disappointed.<br /><br />The Meta-learning stuff is largely covered in his blog and not much more is added. And trying to teach how to memorize a deck of cards, B.... please, those tricks are taught on the back of cornflakes boxes.<br /><br />Using cooking as a vehicle might be a good idea, but it's lost on me. You have to be a total moron in the kitchen to learn any skills in the first half of the cooking part. The rest is pretty cool.<br /><br />There is also some stuff on killing a bird with your hands, hunting and being a red-neck with a shotgun. I guess Tim just put in some skills he thinks are cool in to the book and for some it's a hit, for me a miss.<br /><br />This book is not for me. I see some quality in it, but I am disappointed.<br /><br />I will continue to read his blog. And definitely buy any future book from Tim. I have learned a lot from his hard work, both his books and all the cool free information on his blog.
B00112GVFO|4.0|Great adventure movie. I loved it. Good fun for the whole family. Hard to find movies that are action/adventure that don't have bad language and nudity. I liked the cast thought the acting was great. although parts of this picture are unbelievable at times but we thought they were humorous. We enjoyed this movie.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Got it for free when it was the faotd, works well if you have a good high speed connection. Controls sick but using a touch interface for a mouse driven desktop, it is expected.
0307730697|5.0|Plowed through the book in 3 evenings.  Extremely compelling story of perseverance and battling of personal demons.  Well worth the price of admission.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listen to it at least every day. It's so beautiful and inspiring and I will never get tired of any of the songs.
B009GED3HS|3.0|I don't have any complaints other than everyone is always chasing robin. I wish she would just go get married and leave Ted and Barney alone!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I enjoy the Harry Bosch series. Just wish a new one could come out every week. I read all of Connely's books.
B006GZ8OFQ|5.0|I love the adventure and mystery of this era in history.  It has gentlemen and scoundrels and many interesting characters.
B001FB563E|5.0|My husband asked for this as a christmas present this year. I love Amazon. The movie came so quickly and was by far the cheapest price I saw anywhere. I can always count on amazon. I know my husband will be thrilled to get this as a christmas gift!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album will inspire you to the max. It inspires me to get back into making music. I love listening to it as I create- whether that be crafts, a painting or whether I just feel like being uplifted. Extremely enjoyable. Fun to sing along with.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Arrived super fast and I thanks to the pre order price assurance, I got this for an amazing price...6 bucks less than ive seen it anywhere else. awesome.
B002PLALCO|5.0|Check out P!nk on youtube.com first. Being a fan of crowd awing performances, she does an excellent job of entertaining AND performing this concert. A must for concert fans!
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|Addicting, great acting, interesting twists and turns, believable for the most.<br />It's nice to feel a connectedness to the characters, which comes from the believable/well thought out plot.<br />Great quality video, just a click away! I'm on my 2nd round of watching this entire show, and I'm sure there will be a 3rd, 4th....<br />2 thumbs up!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is THE BEST !!! You will love listening to this music. I have it on my office playlist and listen everyday. LOVE IT
B00881VLCE|4.0|A puzzle app should be just that and this one is. It gives you several pictures with which you can set your puzzle size to, and you can get free pictures to extend your collection. Works flawlessly on the kindle fire.
B0041KVZ1I|3.0|Well after reading much negative review about the box set i figured i'd try buying the individual LP's and start with the one with the worst review. Side one was fair. Surface noise  starting the album. Side 2 had its share of noise. Luckily mine was not warped. I am an audiophile. And i can honestly say the life has been sucked out of this album. I was not impressed. I broke out an older copy to show my wife the difference. We are going to raise a generation full of people who think this is The Beatles on vinyl.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Just as described.  Thanks for sending so quickly.  Will purchase from vendor again if I get the chance.<br /><br />Stacey L.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Got turned onto these guys about a year ago and never miss anything they put out.  These guys were the gateway to classical music for my kids.  I most enjoy the fun the piano dudes obviously have for their art.  Keep rockin' dudes.
B004G6009K|5.0|Just as described.  Thanks for sending so quickly.  Will purchase from vendor again if I get the chance.  Great movie for kids and parents!<br /><br />Stacey L.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|After years of suffering through some incredibly cheap advent calendars, I bought this set and divvied up the pieces for 2 lego-crazy girls' advent calendars.  So far, it has been a bit hit.  Some of the details are really nice and it's really a unique set.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|amazon facebook app wont update as other users are reporting. very annoying. only shows first few stories then dies out
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We bought the Rookie version of this &#34;puzzle&#34; this fall and I was hesitant because I thought the price was a little steep when you consider that it's just a funny-looking ball.  Boy, was I wrong.  These things are addictive!  It took a few weeks of playing to finally get through the whole maze, and it can be frustrating at times, but the kids and adults in our family absolutely love it.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I love being able to relax and watch this show on my laptop! One after the other! I just wish that they had season 5 available on Amazon now!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its agreat app.I use for taxes to keep up with all of the numbers and my son uses it for his homework.
B00A77II0U|5.0|our whole family is hooked! interesting theme and creative graphics. have not finished it yet however so far so good.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|I have never considered myself to be a sheltered person; I read almost anything I can get my hands on including newspapers, magazines and books.  A Long Way Gone opened my eyes to a different part of our world where life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are meaningless words to a child like Ishmael who's life changes in a way a child in the western would could never expect.  A true sad and compelling story that should be required reading for today’s generation.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i love this app! its so fun to use and its worth it :D<br />its so easy to use and its almost proffessional quality. and it works on the kindle fire!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My husband and I enjoy listening to Adele.  We also have her live performance video, which we have watched over and over.  Highly recommend!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I have a brand new Sony tablet and this game is great (I am a huge fan of Fishdom, which they have only put out for Kindle, and that SUCKS)... but every time I complete a puzzle and hit the 'continue' button on the score window, the game shuts off and I have to boot it back up.<br />It isn't the end of the world, because the game saves your progress, but it is most definitely beyond annoying and I hope that it gets fixed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Every friend I have highly recommended this series of books.  I struggled through the first one, and, decided not to read the other two.  It just wasn't my kind of book.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Slip a little Joann Fabrics magnet in the inside cover pouch along the bottom, and you have an instant iPad Mini smartcover.
B007Y1S2HQ|5.0|This is one of the best I have ever purchased.  The words and music are very similar to Carole King. Very calming.  I highly recommend!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I can't believe they have this game!! I love it!! :)) Worth the time to play it, most definitely. Love the characters too.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|If you enjoy Michael Buble' music, you will love this Christmas CD.  I listen to it over and over while driving!  I highly recommend!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I have yet to see a bad Michael Moore movie.  He puts his finger on problems and causes<br />mental pain to some special interests, others of us appreciate his opening new conversations<br />about our country's problems.  Fine Flick.
0547848412|5.0|Book so far has been amazing, I will recommend  before watching the movie. one of my friends read the book a long time ago and liked it better that the movie so this is why i decided to read it first. great book.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Well written and a fun emotional ride!  Looking forward to seeing how the movie compares to the book.  I'm sure the book will be better!
B009E3EY38|4.0|Noone really thought that the remaining members of this legendary Britsh band would ever officially reunite. After wathcing this dvd, it is difficult understand why they chose not to play with Bonham's son Jason earlier. Considering the age of the band members and all of the rock n roll lifestyle over indulgence theyve experienced ,it makes it even more special that after 40 years they can go out on stage and play like they are 20 again. I would put Led Zeppelin up against any young new band of today. Most of these young bands pale in comparison to led zeppelin. Jimmy Page is still exaclty the same as he's always been, as well as the other original members, and having Jason Bonham on drums maintains the original fmaily of this band. Hopefully Led Zeppelin will reconsider their decision to suspend any further live performances, because the fact that they are still alive and well means that they should go out and do what they do best whixh is play these great classic songs to the younger generations.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Great music, very different and yet very enjoyable. The CD was all that I had hoped for, I am ejoying listening to it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoy puzzles without pieces to lose. Simple enough for kids but can be a challenge for adults.<br /><br />I sure have fun with it.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|I was sold on the customer service of this company. I would gladly purchase from this company again. I recommend others to use this company as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest...in a mobile app that FINALLY is user friendly?!?  What more could a pinterest addict ask for! Great interface and finally a pinterest version that does not crash! :)
B0000047BA|3.0|I first heard of this recording a few weeks ago on the radio (Wilbur Jenkins played a few minutes of it on WPFW in Washington, D.C.) and was surprised to learn that Miles Davis had recorded a film soundtrack with John Lee Hooker and Taj Mahal, all artists I admire.  The tunes are generally edgy and electric, and in short segments are pretty dynamic.  In longer doses there is a sense of repetition and droning;  The tunes are &#34;blues-y&#34; but not especially soulful.  Miles was in his last few years (the film was released in 1990 and he died in September 1991) and his playing is more energetic than other recordings from that period.  Hooker is similarly energetic.  This is, of course, background music to a film, with the compositions credited to Jack Nitzsche - I presume he didn't score this note for note but set some parameters and let the musicians fill in the musical space.  The film is a Dennis Hopper directed production apparently with a lot of violence and erotic tension, of which I also had no prior awareness; I'd like to see the film, and I presume the music supports the visuals pretty well.  However, all in all, as a musical experience, it is a curiosity that fans of the artists will be interested in, but it doesn't have a lot of identity..
B00A62UR96|5.0|this is my favorite book from my Christmas childhood. I recommend this book as a Christmas favorite of mine. Please read it to your kids as I love reading the book to my kids year after year.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but gave it four stars because it was predictable.  It was not one of his best books.
0385344228|3.0|I'm only half way through the book. It's a good page-turner with some interesting coverage of contemporary social issues (e.g. the role of social media, genetic determinism). But since it's supposed to be a realistic crime novel, I can't stop thinking about some basic errors in biology made by the author. First, the \\"murder gene\\" that takes up a good part of the story is found on the X chromosome and would therefore be inheritable only from the mother of the person with that mutation. However, the story focuses on the father's fear that he has passed the gene on to his son (the murder suspect). As far as I know (and I'm certainly no geneticist, so somebody please correct me if I'm wrong)the entire X chromosome is inhertited only from the mother.<br /><br />Secondly, the first person narrator is put through a significant amount of emotional stress as a result of being asked to provide his own DNA sample and in getting a DNA sample from his father so as to establish or disprove that there is a family history for possession of the problematic gene. However, if there really is a murder gene that predisposes its possessor to committing acts of violence, wouldn't it be sufficient to show that the suspected murderer has that genetic mutation?<br /><br />The hereditary pattern of violence passed along the male line of descent might make a good story, but it seems that the author could have chosen a gene that could actually be passed along by the father(like the serotonin transporter gene also mentioned in the book). Maybe the latter has less research supporting the \\"murderous\\" traits produced by the mutation, but at least we would be spared being expected to believe the blatant biological impossibility of a gene that is only passed on by mothers being passed on by fathers.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can somenone help me update I can not figure it out because every time I try to update it says there was an error. please try again and I do but it just keeps on saying the same thing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So, some of tbe games might seem a bit lame, but...What more can I say? Fun times, good time waster, and it's free...
B000V63BN6|5.0|While looking to download a few Stevie Wonder songs, I came across this album for a very low price (cost of just a few songs), so I went ahead and downloaded the album. What I got was great collection of songs, some of which I didn't even realize were by Stevie Wonder. I didn't know just how many hits this man put out, and I have an even greater appreciation for his talents. The album is a no brainer if you like this genre of music.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app... when nu charger does not work or remind me that its on, this app is always a livesaver for my dying kindle ;)
B004XN3FHA|5.0|It is crazy crazy bright! Money well spent! I bought number of flashlights prior the superstorm Sandy... Nothing come close to this.  It lites up the living room during blackout better than my normal ceiling lightS!!! Wow
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Best game I've played on my Kindle Fire!  But.... it did freeze on me twice.  Once I had to reboot my device &amp; the other time I had to uninstall &amp; reinstall &amp;  start over. It was worth the 2.99 price though.  I'm happy with it!!! :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|Walking Dead! more like walking crack, you can't get enough of this stuff! Just keep the episodes coming, and I'll keep streaming!
0316044407|4.0|Not that it's a surprise that the book would be better than it's film execution, but Lovely Bones is so much more enjoyable as a book. I don't typically dive into books of this genre (mix of murder mystery and afterlife-oriented), but found myself tearing through this in just a few nights.<br /><br />The crime element is well written, smart, and not overly gory or cliche. The aftermath/family angle is honest and genuine (though at times a bit tedious). The adolescent perspective is very heartfelt and &#34;real.&#34; And the depiction of the afterlife is very unique.<br /><br />What the book gives you that is left out of the movie (SPOILERS AHEAD) - intro/overview of other victims, more insight into the murderer and his history, better detective work, more about the sister, more about the victim interacting from &#34;beyond,&#34; and better development of the murderer's final end.
B009R9WAZ8|3.0|Has a few catchy songs but definitely not as good as her previous albums. Of course i love rihanna so i will continue to buy her music
B002RVCD6O|5.0|I had a quick delivery with this order and got the package a day before expecting it.  I purchased this as a gift and have not taken it out of its wrapper, so when/if I hear back from the recipient about the quality of the dvd, then I will add to my review.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I loved this book and have now bought a ton of Nelsome DeMille so that I can read more about John Corey.  Great character.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the piano Guys!  Excellent CD good for listening to anytime.  The guys enjoy what they do and it shows.  Would highly recommend for all age groups.  :)
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Well, Nesbo succeeds again in delivering an intricate plot, and Harry Hole keeps his aura of genius detective/defective man/hurt by losses. The end is breathtaking. Why not five stars, then? Because serial killers are becoming such clich&eacute;s. Dexter, Ripper, 7even, Hannibal... I'm sick of serial killers, and those who &#34;talk&#34; to the detective are even worse. Nesbo, don't become a serial killer writer, keep being a detective stories writer.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This CD adds to my listening pleasure.  Susan has such a gift to share with the world.  This is a magnificent recording!
B003Y5H4SY|5.0|I enjoy this movie.. Although there are scenes in there that were very comical for a horror movie..overall though I thought it was okay
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie. I have been a fan of the MIB series and I always get a good laugh out of it. I liked the moral of the story and was surprised at how little dialogue there was while still being a great movie. Would watch again.
B003TNQEF0|5.0|No Stephen king sighting. Very similar to the short story. However, a very different ending than I remember from the short story.  Great monsters and effects.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I absolutely love this case.  It's very unique for an e-Reader case; I've had iPad case, phone cases, iPod cases, and this takes the cake.  Inside is nice and soft, but not linty.  The only thing is I accidentally received the wrong fit for my e-Reader.  It's a very nice quality case.  Once I get the one that fits I'll be gravy!
0525953728|5.0|Easy to read, and well narrated. I enjoyed it from fron to back.<br /><br />I really liked the chapter organization, it kept me wanting to read more.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Remarkable plot. Fantastic descriptions.<br /><br />Too bad we can't get the next volume in trilogy on Kindle in US.<br /><br />How can we make that happen???
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. My husband and I look forward to watching it together every year.  It is truly a classic.
B008X77K8W|5.0|Chris Knight is one of the best artists out there in the Alternative Country/ Americana music industry in my opinion. His words are true to life and Little Victories stands right up there as one of his best.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Gives me everything I need, I like the background being dark.....the readability is enhanced, the 15 day forecast is also kind of fun
B000EQ5HSK|4.0|This is a very good quality lens hood. The build and touch are both excellent. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is it is a bit pricey.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I like this app but gets really boring. But you should get this app its fun for little kids. You'll love it.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|This game is kinda fun for me (I am 31 years old) my 5 year old thought it was great though.
B000SEI230|5.0|This was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I ever read and for that reason alone it will always hold a special place in my heart.<br />Sparks is a master at making you fall in love with his leading male characters, at breaking your heart and leaving you wanting more.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|o.m.g.  this is one of the best games ever if u were stupid u wouldn't get this game so stop being stupid and get this game I dare u!!!!!!!!!!
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|I don't know why but this just wasn't one of my favorite Spark's stories.<br />Maybe it was the ending that threw me off or maybe I just never felt that connection that I normally do to his characters, either way I just didn't love this book and that is hard for me to admit because I am a HUGE Sparks fan.
0385528752|5.0|Switch is an amazing book, I highly recommend it for personal change of for educators who work on changing students's behaviors.
B000YHG72E|5.0|My daughter convinced me to sit and watch this with her and I am glad that I did.  It was a pleasant, feel good movie!  Highly recommend!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended edition knocks the theatrical feature completely out of the park.  The scene with Boromir and Faramir is awesome.  All the additional scenes were great and added so more much dimension to the movie.  And the special features was perfection!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Thank you for making this because my daughter really enjoyed it and now is sad because she wants more diary of a wimpy kid books so please make more and thank you so much
B0026O475M|5.0|Just all in all a great movie. I never get tired of watching it. Love the fact that Amazon offers it to rent.
0375507256|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. David Mitchell is both creative and intuitive. The story lines that he weaves through this narrative are above and beyond anything I could have imagined. Great read! *don't see the movie first
B0072OFOM6|5.0|This is one of my favorite series on television. Even though it is not the original Spartacus from season 1, may he rest in peace, it was still very good under the circumstances
B0088P2A7A|5.0|As you can imagine this app has all the information you would ever want or need.  It is easy to use and provides all you would need to become a learned person.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app, even with the ads. They go away quickly so it's not too intrusive. I have it on my kindle and phone. I'm addicted.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I had read the first book, which I found quite hilarious, but this book was a dissapointment, and I decided not to buy the last of the triology
B008IYR2BA|5.0|great show and a super easy way to catch up on the episodes I missed. The picture came in great also.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I have this app installed on my smartphone as well as my Kindle Fire. I use this app every single day because I am crazy about making lists. I have a shopping list, a things to do list, a list of records I want to buy, a list of TV shows I want to watch... any kind of list you can think of. I love lists and making lists helps me sleep at night. So I guess what I'm saying is: Thank you to the makers of this app for helping me sleep.<br /><br />I should also note you have the ability to sync your lists in the app so that it's the same on multiple devices. I didn't discover that feature until recently - but it's AWESOME.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I will be looking for more Wool stories. I'll also be reading more Hugh Howey offerings. This was my first Kindle purchase, and it was a wonderful way to start!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I use it to keep track of a bunch of web comics that have RSS feeds. And they look absolutely beautiful on the Kindle Fire! I never have any problems with it, either. Thumbs up!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in 2 days. Great story line with super hot scenes!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I NEVER have problems with this app. Thank goodness because I check twitter about a billion times a day. And I love being able to access it from my Kindle Fire.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This was her best so far!!  I enjoyed listening to it over and over again. She is one of my favorite performers.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I mean I really really love pinterest. It's pretty great! Having reliable access to it on my Kindle Fire is a plus. The only downfall of this app is sometimes I go through SO MANY pins that it stops reloading at a certain point. (As far as I know, that doesn't happen on the internet.)
B007WOFXB8|1.0|The master tapes used for Rio Grande Mud, Tres Hombres, Fandango! and Deguello are from the \\"The ZZ Top Six Pack\\" 1987 remix/remaster/disaster. Eliminator hasn't been remastered.<br /><br />I know a lot fans have issues with the Six Pack remix/remasters because of the 'drum in the garbage can sound'.<br /><br />I would 100% recommend [[ASIN:B002Q6OEAI The Best Of ZZ Top]] none of the tracks have been remixed or remastered. ;)
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|I really think that Phenomena, with Deep Red, Inferno and Suspiria is the best movie by Argento...<br />I watched Phenomena in Italy at the movie theatre when was released in 1984....<br /><br />Don't miss it!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Heard Flynn is good and learned it to be quite true. I intend to read his previous work immediatelt. Very clever w/o being abstract.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ernest Cline is very creative and readable.  I love the way he developed the characters.  I felt like I was the main protagonist.<br />Give this book a try.
B00114LF4E|5.0|Hi All, I am working my way through this set and the Brahms 1, Haydn 103, Beethoven 7, Mozart 40/41 all great, sound is fantastic for the vintage.  However with the R&J from Tchaikovsky, I find a sudden drop in sound levels.  Is this also your experience ? Thanks
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a fun game that will keep you occupied for hours at a time because it becomes addictive after a few plays. Runs very good on my 2.2 Android tablet. Fun graphics and sound too.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr.!  This is a great take on a classic story!  Exciting and fast paced, but classic Sherlock were it makes you think!
0374275637|5.0|Wonderful book! This book reminds me of Julian Jaynes' origins of<br />consciousness theory as voices in our head between our two brain<br />hemispheres. Basically, it hypothesizes that we are two intellectual<br />persons, which he calls System 1 and System 2. System 2, the deductive<br />system, is prisoner of System 1, the sense-making system. System 2 can<br />only act on what System 1 presents. What's wonderful about this book<br />is that it is a philosophical theory of a life-long research on<br />decision-making that the author conducted with Amos Tversky. The two<br />systems explain why we are not completely rational in our judgment and<br />how our biases lead us astray. Moreover, System 1 looks for patterns<br />where there might be none and System 2 has no choice but to follow. I<br />also liked the distinction between the experiencing self and the<br />remembering self. We do (or don't do) things taking into account the<br />remembering self. The remembering self is our own police.<br /><br />I actually bought the book from Amazon after reading it from my library.<br />It's that good!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Enjoyed the book. Very unusual.  It arrived early. I will order more from this company<br />Good book and funny book.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I thought this book was ok.  Not bad, but not one that I would recommend to my friends.  I did not like it as well as Gone Girl.
0399160450|3.0|This book is certainly an improvement over the completely ghost-written junk Clancy has tied his name too, and also improves on his recent co-written books.  I like the book overall, but still nowhere near the great stuff he used to write.<br /><br />Lots of wasted filler on John Ryan junior's relationship with his girlfriend. He's whipped, we get it....now drop it.<br /><br />Good techno stuff on cyberwar, this is the reason the book didn't get 2 stars. It does have relevance to the modern world.<br /><br />However.....as usual the authors overdue everything, and in the process make it look unrealistic.  It's the typical \\"US is soft and unprepared, and the bad guys almost stomp us...then we come back with a vengeance\\". Tired, same old same old cliche.<br /><br />Frankly, Clancy is only 65, you'd think he'd have time to get off his rear and write some really good books again. Maybe his is already senile, or just greedy and lazy.<br /><br />Not worth the money, but if you are a fan, you'll read this book, and probably enjoy most of it, as I did.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|Kill Bill is probably the 5th best movie ever directed by Quentin Tarantino. I love the blood and gore and how he also mixes in kung-fu action as well
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Nothing quite like this show.  It's clever and the story never gets boring. Love the unexpected twists and turns the writers of this show produce.
1469984202|5.0|Yes, I could put this book down.  In fact, I put it down several times.  I let my Kindle go dark because I could not bear to have it end -- it broke my heart to finish it.  So I made it last.  And I think about it.  This is a gritty story of the magic of the human spirit -- it is about the retaking of humanity and individuality and community. The author does not beat you over the head; he lets the characters take you on a journey of redemption.  The message is not preachy but it is timeless -- it could have been written in the 1400s or the 1900s or today.  I found it agnostically inspirational!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Not as good, I didn't think, as Pillars but overall well done and I would recommend it to anyone who reads historical fiction
1933865474|4.0|I own both the original and this pocket version. The differences between the two are that the pocket version is a bit smaller and that some pages that featured licensed comic characters were omitted to avoid licensing fees so this pocket version could be offered at a more affordable price.<br /><br />That said, the paper quality is the same so the color reproduction is great. The larger page size of the original version is certainly nicer, feels more like viewing a portfolio. If having the extra comic book characters and the larger size are important to you, track down the original. The prices have gone quite high on it, but I think its worth it for die hard Timm collectors like me. Actually the die hards will own both. I will look most at this pocket version to to keep the larger version in nicer condition.<br /><br />Either way this pocket version is a must have. The only downside is it might wet your appetite for the larger form. I uploaded a photo comparing the size.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|As always Tim has provided valuable information on how to leverage our daily activities in such a way as to gain maximum results - never thought I would ever take on cooking but with Tim as a guide I am on my way!
B005RZB65Q|3.0|The basic premise is that there are 2 modes of thinking 'fixed' mindset or 'growth' mindset. And depending on which one you lean towards can influence what you make of your life. The 'fixed' mindset is that intelligence is fixed, there are some things which I can never be good at so I shouldn't try. 'Growth' mindset is that none of my traits are fixed and that I can be good at whatever I put my mind to. Nothing really revolutionary here. Then it's hundreds of pages giving examples of people in business and sports who have one or the other i.e. basically retrofitting a theory onto past events (something people who live in ivory towers tend to do a lot).<br />There's also a big chapter on raising kids - note the author doesn't actually have kids - so I'm not sure that she would be the best person to give advice about that.<br /><br />Some of the sagely advice she gives are:<br />- if a kid bullies your child, tell your child to talk to the kid and lets all hug and sing kumbaya (look I just saw a unicorn !) - I tend to teach my kids to fight back - i.e. not to let bullies push them around<br />- never tell your child that he/she is clever or smart. She gives no evidence of why this is a bad thing, it's only her personal theory. I'm sure a lot of successful people in the world have been told that they were smart or clever at some point in their lives - it doesn't seem to have affected them.<br />- lot's of examples on how to talk to kids - from someone who doesn't actually have any child - did I mention that?<br /><br />Her theory is true in part as I believe that most people have untapped potential, but not everyone can be an Einstein or be good at anything they choose to be. If that's true then the author could probably do more with her life than just write a book telling you about mindsets - she could probably have discovered a unified field theory for physics or something.<br /><br />The book could have been summarized in a few pages. The key takeaway message from it is \\"you can be whatever you want to be, as long as you put in the hard work. And don't let failures stop you. Failures are a good chance to learn.\\"
0800141660|5.0|Such a romantic movie with wonderful twists to the story. Great watch and will watch many times more. Also, buying as a gift for others.
B009OXS8RQ|5.0|I absolutely loved Born To Die and was therefore eagerly awaiting her follow-up. While I think she should have released a full-album, maybe next February, I was still delighted to get her new EP. I love the new songs, they are different overall in that the music is less over-produced, thus allowing her beautiful voice to shine through. My favorites on this EP are Ride, American, Cola and Gods & Monsters. If you already like Lana, you will love this new EP, if you have not gotten into her before, this is a great place to start.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I absolutely loved Pillars ...... and was anxious to read this sequel.  It was almost equal to Pillars and I will read all Ken Follett writes in the historical fiction mode.
B009D5VPTI|5.0|My 6 year old daughter said she'd give this one million stars!  Mom and Dad enjoyed the positive female role modeling.
0761536434|4.0|I have a grandchild who is interested in the development of video games and is constantly asking her father about \\"how the old games worked\\"  So, he and I decided that this book will give her the background she needs to understand how systems and games have evolved over the years.  I anticipate that this book will answer her questions.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson fans will take great delight in this release. Others should find it charming and engaging. It's a funny movie with a wonderful cast.
B0095R64AO|2.0|Kept hoping it would pick up, but I just got so depressed by it that I stopped watching it.  Oh well.
0385344333|4.0|Another great Reacher story.  I wonder if Tom Cruise can do justice to this extraordinay 'hero', whom I envision quite differently from Cruise.
0544045203|3.0|I finally bought a copy and got very excited after reading the prologue. The story sounded very promising. 50 pages into the book I started struggling though with the heavy religious content. I am not particularly interested in religion so maybe this is not the right book for me but I will keep trying and have set my \\"Ok, that's it\\" mark at page 100...
0547884591|4.0|I am a long-time huge fan of Tim Ferriss, so take this review with that in mind.<br /><br />First off, I realized that I'm way more advanced at cooking than I thought I was--I also realized that most of the food in the book wasn't appealing to me as a home cook. I will probably try some of the recipes but I wasn't impressed with the actual recipes.<br /><br />Second, I loved this book. I enjoy reading about Tim's adventures and his very manic style of writing. I think this book was every bit as enjoyable as 4-Hour Body with an angle that interests me even more than health.<br /><br />The Kindle edition of the book is gorgeous and well formatted. Because of the publisher, I had extremely high expectations for how this book should look and work. I wasn't disappointed. The table of contents worked beautifully, footnotes/endnotes worked flawless with the back option. It made flipping back and forth easy and not painful at all (unlike SOME books).<br /><br />That said, I will probably buy this book in print as well because I do find that it felt disjointed. Because it was not a print replica each thing was on a separate page. In a print book one page might have a block of text and a callout box. Because the book wasn't formatted that the subject seemed to change between pages. I knew what was happening but it wasn't enjoyable to me.<br /><br />A solid third book from Tim Ferriss. I'm looking forward to his next project!
B00190OHD6|4.0|I decided to give it a four star because with all the reviews I thought this movie was going to be the best movie ever. The theme was not as I expected and I definitely have seen better movies than this one. Try it yourself and rate as your mind sees it.
030758836X|3.0|For the first 2/3 of the book, I would have given it 4 stars, but for the last third it would have been 3, so the actual rating is 3/12.  I was very excited to read this book as I'd read so much good about it and it was nominated for 2012 Best Book awards.  Ms. Flynn is a good writer.  Her story plot is very well-constructed and her depiction of Amy and Nick is very realistic.  The book is chilling too, as more and more stuff comes about each of these two and their \\"perfect couple\\" story.  This is a book that is difficult to precis because it would be hard to do without having spoilers somehow getting in, so I'm not going to do that.  I'm just going to say that the book starts out eerie, creepy and off-the-wall, but after about 2/3 of the way in, it becomes rather long and tedious, and the ending is not satisfying at all.  I totally had lost interest by page 330, but read until the end anyway just to see how it would end.  Would I recommend reading it?  Probably, since it has turned out to be an important book for 2012, and it is so totally different than most psychological thrillers.  Unfortunately, for me, it just didn't quite measure up.  When I compare this book to anything by Barbara Vine or Minette Walters, it's not in the same league.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It does a good job of telling me the weather - i just really dislike applications that run in the background for no reason.  Its annoying to have to force stop an application after i have closed it just to keep it from running in the background when i am not using it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed this insight into the world of teens with cancer. Some things are the same between teens in love, whether you are sick or not.
B009MF5BXK|2.0|There's something missing in this follow up to the enjoyable Expendables 1. Overall it felt as if the story and characters relied too much on cookie cutter formulas taking a backseat to the action sequences. It also felt like the large ensemble cast was poorly juggled compared to the first film.<br /><br />Speaking of that ensemble there's a large cast which shows that doesn't always make a memorable film: Bruce Willis, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Liam Hemsworth, Jet Li, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Chuck Norris.<br /><br />Again, quite the disappointment.<br /><br />The budget was $100M and it made over $315M at the Box Office.<br /><br />SOUND: C plus; CINEMATOGRAPHY: C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: C minus; ACTION SEQUENCES: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012; OVERALL GRADE: C plus.
B002ONV5E6|4.0|Well acted with great continuity from the previous films. Matt Damon has seai that he is done with this character... I hat to see that happen.
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and I decided to show this movie to my toddler. She loved the colors, but was not as happy to see it as I was. I love it
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Well, Garth is not on iTunes so if you want him on your iPhone/pod/pad you have to get a CD and load him that way. Have you ever bought a CD for 2 hits and never listen to the rest? That's not a problem here!! I know pretty much every song and I'm not even a country music fan. These are all major hits! And 34 songs and I doubt I'll ever watch the DVD, but hey--it's thrown in for $10--why not? Great purchase.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Gameplay and controls are simple. Great and unique concept. On Google Play 38000 people gave it and average of 5/5. As in the description it won multiple game of the year award. On Google Play it is a few dollars cheaper though so that's a little unfair on Amazons part. I wont be surprised if this gets on the top 100 list really soon.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|This album is a little more laid-back and traditional than their usual music, but it is still a wonderful example of the beauty of the human voice.  They are a very talented a cappella group and I am always awe struck by their talent.
B002PNLDWO|4.0|This is a great family movie and we thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  The only reason that I gave it a four star instead of a five star is that it subtly presented evolution and reincarnation when the father told the daughter, after her mother's death, that her mother was with her in the trees, birds, and so on.  If the person watching the movie is a Scripture believing Christian, they would need to explain to their children that this is not in keeping with what Scripture teaches.  It could be a great teaching moment or an oversight that could be cause for children to believe something not biblically sound.  And, they also suggested that the growing up of Amy, the main character, was indicative of getting a nose ring piercing.  The movie would not have suffered had these been left out.  Sorry to be so critical of an, otherwise wonderful movie.  Just want people to be aware that this movie is a great family movie, but not without the usual Hollywood influence.<br /><br />We truly enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it for an evening of family time and a teaching moment or two.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The music produced by the Piano Guys is the most uplifting, inspiring music you will ever hear. Infused with their passion and incredible talent for music, these pieces are intricately performed and so upbeat that you will find yourself obsessed with these tunes in your head all day long!  It is refreshing that such wholesome music can be made in this day and age when repetition and unimaginative music is so widespread and accepted.<br /><br />Stunning, brilliantly arranged pieces will uplift, inspire, excite, intrigue, and amaze you! The artists of The Piano Guys take modern music and translate them into pieces that are out of this world. Take \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" for example. A popular, fun song is unquestionably made a million times better through their ingenious arrangement. These guys take the lid off a grand piano and begin playing directly on the strings! As a piano teacher of ten years, I have never once thought of doing that. The video of that song is a must-see. The arrangement is so fun and really just makes me happy!<br /><br />Another breath-takingly beautiful video is the one for Peponi. I love that a grand piano is flown onto the location by a helicopter. That's not even the best part. A coldplay original song, this is such an awesome interpretation. It actually creates 'Paradise' within.<br /><br />Jon Schimdt has been a favorite composer of mine for over eighteen years. Upbeat, heartfelt, expressive pieces are his trademarks. You can hear his classical training in his compositions. He makes classical COOL! It was one of my long-time goals to be able to play his trademark piece \\"All of Me.\\"<br /><br />I show these videos to my piano students and they never fail to make my kids excited about learning to play instruments!These guys show how playing an instrument can be such a fun thing to do. What amazing talent! Incredible, wholesome, amazing, awesome, excellent, are all words I would use to describe the music created by these artists!<br /><br/>All I feel is PURE JOY when I listen to all of this music!!!
B004BEMC6G|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and would reccomend this to anybody. It's action packed and has a great story line.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Runs awesomely on my rooted GS Blaze 4G. I use it for recreation only but I also have unlimited data thru T-Mobile.
B00336C3EY|5.0|A movie about a Jewish family with a few problems done in classic Coen Brothers style.  The symbolism of their photography and their music is amazing.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|well thought through and research, great argument and a shocking wake up call for how we eat today and how we really ought to eat.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This will be good fun, especially for those of us who grew up in the era where these comic book characters were our TV ....
B005QUQP76|2.0|Really the cord? This mouse looked crappily made when I purchased it, but seemed to preform pretty well so I didn't mind. After about 3 months the cord has broken internally, so that if i bend it at just the right angle it works fine.<br /><br />I would recommend corsair power supplies (have 3) all day long, but don't buy this mouse.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I find playing this game very calming, along with the background music which is soothing.It is a fun game for all ages.<br />Somewhat addictive because you want to beat your time, every time! I strongly recommend it.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I really like this game. But I wish it gave you more energy. seems like if you want to get any thing accomplished you have to buy diamonds alot!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I happen to like these books. I find them interesting and the characters, characters. They are not light hearted, feel good books.<br />But justice is usually served. (cold).:o)
B00A89ITZG|5.0|for anyone who does crossfit and wants to enhance their running, biking or swimming - and even their crossfit - this is a must read. well written, well researched, and great insight. highly recommended.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Quite a different role for both of these excellent actors, but played very well by each, and FUN to watch....
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is a very complete App. It not only tells you how much battery life is left, it gives you hours and minutes left depending on what you are using your tablet for.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This is a great app! I love it, because you can watch music videos for free, in HD without having to download them!
0345389409|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. A new take on an old devil and the spirits of earth. I am a scholar and have a high interest in history and religion. It is spiritual imagination used to the highest degree. It also helps that the lovably characters of the Vampire Cronicles are intertwined in the book. Also the book does not take long to read due to the frenzy of emotion.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I like this game.  You do have to be cautious about the temptation to purchase gems for real cash but it's your choice.<br />You can still enjoy the game. g
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I've loved Carlos since I first heard the original Santana. There is no more versatile guitarist on the planet. Rock, blues, Latin, jazz; you name it and he can own it.
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Boring!!!!! This was a real letdown...It had a good premise but &#34;No Way&#34; did it fullfill the promise that was eluded to...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Nice game to kill time.  Takes a while to build up coins. Graphics are decent and game runs fine in kindle fire.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid The Third Wheel was a great book with awesome detail and is very funny. I would mostly reccomend this book to children and middle schoolers who would probably understand the concept more. It was a very novel after Cabin Fever.
B00A7ZWUJC|3.0|I like Rihanna. I like many of her songs. However this is my first time buying her album. I was excited when I heard Diamonds and thought this was going to be an impressive album. Well, maybe I'm just too old (35). But I just don't like this album. The songs are simply stupid, ghetto, and lazy. I say lazy because there was absolutely no creativity involved in the making of these songs. In an attempt to please both her pop and r&b/ urban fans, she vacillates between ghetto garbage and stale, generic pop music. It all sounds like something you've heard before. I like Diamonds and Nobody's Business. Youngsters probably won't like Nobody's Business because it has a throwback/ retro sound that is reminiscent of 90's pop/dance music. But I like it a lot. But for me, those are the only songs on the album worth any mention.<br /><br />EDIT 4/30/13:<br /><br />This album didn't excite me at first. But I must admit it grew on me. I mostly listen to it in the car. It wasn't what I expected when I listened to it the first few times. But it's RIHANNA...in all her essence. After listening to it in the car, I've grown to like it and appreciate it for what it is. My favorite/repeat plays are Phresh off the Runway, Diamonds, Numb, Stay, Loveeee Song, Ain't Nobody's Business, and Get It Over With.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|I expected this movie to be funny.  It only reminded me of married life's disappointments.  If you like movies about the struggles of marriage then you would like this movie.
B006R1T40I|5.0|The voice, the slide guitar...Bonnie Raitt brings more to a performance than any other female artist and never fails to give me chills.
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|An entertaining movie that kept my attention. Great to see allot of mega stars in one movie. Like The Expendables 1; worth watching.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age Village is a fun and very interactive game with fabulous graphics. The quality of the graphics in this game is unbelievable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the most addictive site .  Plan on having lots of time and enjoy the wonderful ideas supplied by your peers.
B0091LS07E|4.0|I love how Alicia Keys keeps reinventing herself.  This is the hallmark of true artistry. If I had to describe this album in one term, I'd say Nostalgically good R&B. Lyrically, the songs are simple, with her last two albums having more profound lyrics.  This album reminds me of when I used to LOVE R&B. Think Zhane, Floetry....yeah like that. When I listen to \\"Listen to your Heart\\" and \\"Atleast I Got to Love You,\\" it takes me back to a simpler time in R&B, and actually gives me feelings of nostalgia.  NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM. This album is a mix of modern/current with older style R&B. It's not her best work. But it's definitely very good and noteworthy. In saying that, I am comparing this album to As I am and The Element of Freedom; which are great albums, of which she will have a difficult time ever topping. Glad I got it. And if you're an AKeys fan, you probably will be too.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My daughter loved this movie!  I would recommend it as a family movie for everyone to watch.  It would make a great gift.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I can't get enough of Castle.  The stories and characters are superb.  I love the humor and the great acting by the cast.  Keep it coming!!!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Anyone who knows this classic dinosaur movie will love this!!! Who couldn't possibly love Jurassic Park?  Let the adventure begin...
B008NMT684|5.0|The kids liked it and it showed them how to slide a screen. They kept busy and liked doing it over and over.
B008B8A9V8|4.0|This is an excellent reference book regardless of your level of knitting. Gives the beginner many options, provides the seasoned knitter with ease of reference
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. In Enzo, Stein manages to give a voice to that specially dog that everyone has had, the one that proves that dog really is man's (or woman's!) best friend.<br /><br />Normally I would summarize the plot, but that isn't really the point of this book. The plot is decent, although Stein does pile on excessively bad things on his well-meaning but sometimes stupid human protagonist, and the resolution does happen a bit too abruptly. The point of the book is the narrative voice of the Enzo the dog, and Stein captures that beautifully.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little pocket sharpener is a great deal! I have used large Smith's sharpening kits for years and it worked great but was always an ordeal to sharpen my knives and wasn't really practical to take into the field when I was hiking ect. But Smith's Pocket Pal Sharpener is a great solution. Made by a brand I trust and super easy to use! I HIGHLY recommend any Smith's product and think if you ever carry a pocket knife you should carry a Smith's Pocket Pal.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|For those of us that read the Percy Jackson books, this is more or less the continuation of that series. I thought this one did a great job of living up to the Percy Jackson spirit! Can't wait for the next one. :)
0439023513|5.0|The book was shipped quickly and came in great shape (new). I love these books and would suggest them to anyone who enjoys reading!
B001NLKWLW|2.0|i really loved the secret garden and there were undertones of that story in this book. however, i thought it was a bit confusing at times--i would often wonder who the author was talking about and have to go back to figure it out. i do tend to like books with &#34;closure&#34; but this seemed to tie together a little too perfectly....the people searching for answers to past mysteries always seemed to run into/talk to just the right person. or they just happen to find that hidden treasure that had been buried for 100 years. a little cheesy to me and not very believable. although it was a pretty long book, the characters were pretty shallow. maybe too many people to develop? i don't know. would not recommend this book or read it again.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|A lighthearted roadtrip that grabs your attention and won't let go.<br />Surprises and exceeds expectations.<br />The main character is a little unbelievable in that he rolls along seemingly on whim, his whole life, while the world around him growls on in turmoil.
B0015DROBO|2.0|After hearing, &#34;You must read this book,&#34; from multiple quarters, I gave in and gave Dragon Tattoo a try. I still don't understand what all the fuss was about. Perhaps it is better in its original language, but the translation was awkward and stilted. As a result, I found it difficult to get through. I think people mistake the bursts of gratuitous violence for bona fide action in an otherwise boring book. Plus, the characters, with the possible exception of Lisbeth, are all fairly one-dimensional.<br /><br />I understand that the point of the book is to bring attention to violence against women, which I appreciate. The execution of this goal, however, was in my opinion, poor due to lack of character development and stilted writing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is quite fun.  Took me a few days to realize that tapping the screen when the birds are in mid-flight will chane their flight pattern to get more points was a true revelation.  it was fun going back and blowin' the doors off what i thought were &#34;high&#34; scores!  this screen on the kindle was wonderfully sensitive and spot on, making the game truly exciting (and frustrating sometimes).  quite the challenge.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|I have always liked Three Days Grace music. I thought the last CD released by them was a little lacking, but otherwise good. This CD was much better. I really enjoyed listening to it and I have it on all of my devices.
0439023491|5.0|I got this gift for my Mother after I refused to let her borrow my copy. I have no doubt she will enjoy it thoroughly!
B002M87W2W|5.0|The movie is a family movie all can watch about a  St. Louis family in a simpler time with entertaining events happening every season with the opening of the World's Fair as a backdrop.  Lot of the locations are familiar to St. Louis area people.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Excellent movie. I've watched this movie many times. With all the chemicals and drugs out there, the wold becoming infertile seems like a remote possibility. This movie does it well. Good acting, great camera skills. I'm not going to say anymore and spoil the movie. Watch it.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|The other books in this series were pretty good reads. After the last one I swore I wasn't going to continue. I caved in and went ahead and got it,this one took off on a whole new direction and I don't see any end in sight. Probably not going to finish the series too far off the original path.
B0051UIHWW|5.0|Ben R. Rich does such a good job of describing the events and people that were involved in the U-2, the stealth fighter, and the Blackbird, that you feel you are on the team. You get to find the problems and help solve them with unique (sometimes-simpler) solutions. I found the explanation that being invisible to radar has nothing to do with size. And it is over way too soon.<br /><br />This makes you wonder what they are up to today?<br /><br />[[ASIN:0760317925 Ultimate Fighter: Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter]]
0143116371|5.0|One hell of a wonderful book on people and there taste in fashion .a must have book .ian C ,it gets five stars from me .
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Harry Bosch Novels are always full of suspense and very hard to put done.  Looking forward to the next one.
B000L53D4O|4.0|Little more basic than expected and a little smaller than thought. It is very easy for storage and set up so it was good
B001HNE3NO|5.0|From beginning to end I found the book just so disturbing. What Jewish people went through during that period in history and the strength that was shown just to live another day.  How they helped each other, but also people who were friends suddenly turned on you.  This is a period in history that should<br />never be forgotten.  I found myself absorbed in the book not being able to put it down. The author sucks you in and you are right there with her throughout<br />the whole book.  I love history and this book really fit the bill.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|When a friend sent me the first youtube video of the Piano Guys I was floored at how much I liked the cello and the piano. I have never been a true classical fan so piano and cello were not that high on my must listen to kind of music. I listened to a few more and before you know it I was hooked on what these guys do! Then I became a subscriber so I would get them as soon as they are released. I love the videos which seem to just add an extra dimension to the music but when the cd was finally available, I got it asap. I have to tell you that as much as I now love to watch the videos and look forward to each new one, listening to the cd at home on a really good stereo system, the music will blow you away. It just fills the house. I can't wait till they create a dvd so I can run it through the surround sound on the tv to hear it and see it the way it is meant to be seen and heard! Thank you Piano Guys for such a great listening--and watching--experience!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm not good at writing flowery reviews.  All I can say is that the five tales contained in this omnibus left me wanting to read more from this author, especially more about the people who live in the silos, and I'm getting ready to work on First Shift and Second Shift, won't even wait for the combined version in 2013. $5.99 is truly a small price to pay for such a good read.
0446580848|2.0|What happened here?  I was so looking forward to reading Demille's latest novel starring John Corey but I struggled through this book as I found myself flipping pages ahead and growing very tired of the overdone wise cracks  and one-liners from Mr. Corey.  First three quarters of the book is boring and mostly useless descriptions of Yemen and it's population.  Nothing exciting happens and the plot is thin.  Very disappointing read...hope the next one is better.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|The whole cd is fun and upbeat! It's a great mood lifter! I already can't wait for the next one.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Very well written.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  Gillian Flynn has become one of my favorite authors.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|I had seen Tom Hardy in several movies prior to this one. RockNRolla and Inception, to name a couple. Both are films I enjoyed immensely, but it wasn't until Bronson that I made the effort to learn the actor's name. Upon viewing the cover of the film and reading the synopsis, I must admit that I was apprehensive. I finally gave the film a chance out of sheer boredom, and it was instantly cemented in my list of all time favorites.<br /><br />Bronson is something of a psychotic one man show. I have heard it compared to A Clockwork Orange many times, but I must disagree as I find more similarities between this film and There Will Be Blood than anything else. Both films focus more on presenting a character for our examination rather than tell us a story. These characters are broken, complex men of incredible ambition and seemingly minimal humanity. Director  Nicolas Winding Refn's pacing is spot on, steady with sporadic ups and downs like a theatrical heart rate monitor. The soundtrack is nothing short of perfect. This film seems to find the music that none of us would call to mind for a scene and pair the two perfectly.<br /><br />I can't recommend this flick enough. It's definitely not for everyone, as indicated by the slew of one star reviewers who had nothing more to say than \\"I'm bored\\" but I will say this: You will either love this film or hate it, but it is definitely something everyone should give a try.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|I like the music but the cover is so bad I find it very distracting in my iphone.  If you are going to call a collection \\"Warrior\\" why dress Ke$ha like a Christmas ornament?  Why not put her in armor.  Armor is hot.  Or put some face paint on her and put her in a pose where she looks dangerous and not waiting for a train.  So buy the collection and Ke$ha if you are looking, please consider a new designer.  I've seen you look like a warrior before even one time with glitter on and this cover is not it.  Anyway Ke$ha rocks and I designed my own cover for my phone.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I haven't gotten the regular version of this CD from Amazon yet, but I did just run to my local Target to get the DELUXE EXCLUSIVE 4 Bonus Tracks version, available only at Target, and P.S. \\"Fade Into You\\" IS NOT on that version either.  All of the regular version copies did have the sticker on them claiming \\"Fade Into You\\" is on the CD, but it is not.  The 4 bonus tracks that are on the DELUXE EDITION are: I'll Be There (Sam Palladio),  Love's Ring Of Fire (Clare Bowen), Undermine (Acoustic version) (Hayden P. & Charles E.),  & Changing Ground (Connie B.).  Still a very good CD, I was thrilled to see a soundtrack had been released. I love the show & enjoy the songs.  You can always download \\"Fade Into You\\" from iTunes or Amazon like I did.
B0063IH60K|3.0|There aren't options for dealing 1 card v 3.  It doesn't keep score of total wins. But most annoying of all are the adds you have to suffer through at the start each game.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Excellent read.  Haven't read a book in a year or so and now I am back in town.  This book was captivating from beginning to end.  Highly recommended.  I have always been a John Grisham fan and this book is a prime example as to why.  Looking forward to the next one.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Very well written.  I had a very hard time putting this book down.  Gillian Flynn is an excellent author, and I will be looking for more books from her.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Crazy, Stupid, Love's premise sounds so familiar when I read the synopsis, but it turned out to be one of the funniest and freshest romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. Yeah sure,  it's the same old thing, but the clich&eacute;d old story hasn't been told so witty and revealing since the masterpiece Tootsie!. The perfectly casted ensemble, is pitch perfect here and even though many of the plot twists have been seen time and time again, I have never been so surprised at their revealing!<br /><br />Carell show's once again he has the acting chops to be both funny and sincere, Gosling one of this generations finest actors gives a fun performance that is both hilarious and endearing. The girls (Moore and Stone) give insightful and believable performances as well.<br /><br />While so many romantic comedies are considered \\"chick flicks\\" Crazy, Stupid, Love is entertaining for both men and women.<br /><br />I own the Blu Ray and found the transfer to be very appealing with no problems. Extras on a film like this are not all that important to me, but I found what was here to be interesting.
B0076DELIG|5.0|My major complaint about Michael Connelly is that he has only written about 25 novels and writes more slowly than I read.<br /><br /> The evolution of Harry Bosch as an individual  throughout this series is compelling; the nature of his problem solving strategies has not lost its fascination over the past 20 years or so Connelly has been writing.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|Wreck it Ralph is hands down one of the best animated movies ever! It's a funny movie that everyone in the family will enjoy! It gave me alot of nostalgia watching my favorite video game characters come to life. Not only is Wreck It Ralph funny but it is also one of the most unique movies I have ever seen. I was really impressed with Wreck It Ralph and I'm excited that there might be a sequel!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait until the 3rd book comes out. I will be buying it the day it comes out. Different take then Fifty Shades of Grey.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this game was a five star for me and my husband until they wanted us to spend real money on rarity and rainbow dash. its not fair that story line ponies cost real money
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It's a bit annoying when I hit like for a status and it shows for a minute & then it doesn't show as being liked. It also doesn't show all of the statuses which is a bit annoying. Otherwise it's Facebook so what more can you expect.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. One of the stress relievers that I have found.  It only takes a couple of minutes to feel better. Try it the next time you are stressed.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am glad to say this! This book is not a sex book, porn or any cheap novel. It is a very profund love story between an innocent young woman and a man with a terrible early childhood, who manges to overcome his severe traumas through mutual love and devotion. Now, having said this, I am in the midst of the third book and I can therefor not know if I will have the same opinion once I finish the third book! Just figure out how exciting it is to read this. Of course there is plenty of sex, anything wrong with that?
B005IQ39AY|3.0|At least it's free because as soon as you die you have to start over. You should get this if you like bubble games if you do not DO NOT get this!!!
B0076DELIG|4.0|A believable police story with a not too predictable ending. Definitely on par with other Bosch adventures. You're not likely to get bored with this one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|l like it very much,  use it almost every day,  is it already 2 0 w o r d s?
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm a huge fan of The Piano Guys. I pre-ordered the CD the moment I heard it was available. I just wish they had a DVD so I could have the music and videos at anytime, with or without internet. Their videos are truly inspiring!
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|I love a good fast-paced movie with a twist. I rented it first and liked it so much I'm giving one as a gift.
886613077X|2.0|I have this mini planner now with the monthly calendar in the front, this appeared to be identical but the calendar in the front is<br />completely different and not useful to me. The description seemed identical to the one I love. I wish there have been photos of the calendar to have seen the difference.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I find myself on here daily. Lots of great ideas as well as awesome photos that people share. I recommend it to everyone.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist was short, sweet, and beautiful in its simplicity.  Overall it was a great and inspiring lazy afternoon read.
B007HACDLK|5.0|You can never go wron g with a Vince Flynn book.<br />I cannot understand why each one is not made into<br />a BLOcKBUSTER hit movie.<br />Cannot wait until the next one arrives.<br />Keep going Viince.<br />Thank you
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another good &#34;Harry Bosch&#34; read from M. Connelly.  I really like the Lincoln Lawyer, but Harry will always be my favorite.  The writing and story are great and the plot always a good mystery.  I'm just sad that I'll have to wait another couple of years for a new book.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I thought this was just for kids, but I enjoy it as much as my grandkids. What a nice surprise for me.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|When I first saw this video was available for viewing in Halo Waypoint on the Xbox 360, I was skeptical about what I was about to watch.  I was thinking it was going to be a 20 minute video with some props to Master Chief (Main Hero of the Halo Series) and cameo appearances of some Covenant (aliens main \\"bad guys\\") etc.  I started the movie and was I pleasantly wrong!  You can watch this movie even if you have never played any of the Halo games and have a good idea of storyline.  The cinema photography is amazing.  Special effects are excellent, and a very passionate story line.  This show was superb in a lot of respects in my opinion.  The only minute complaint I have which isn't big at all is I wish it was the same voice actor that voiced the master chief in the games doing the voice in the movie.  It's not a big issue at all, so I wouldn't let that discourage you from watching this video if you have played Halo before.  When the movie finished I was a little sad the movie was over.  I hope that they make a movie and/or series.  If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, I would suggest watching this movie, and see why fans of Halo love this franchise.
B00A5052YE|4.0|I lke most of the songs on this CD.  I always start off slow with a new Alicia Keys CD, but I usually end up totally loving it, I'm sure this one will be no different.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|In my opinion, Kingdom of Heaven is one of the most underrated items I have come across. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and receives very little attention. The extra scenes explain the story considerably better. I cannot totally hate whoever decided to cut it down since the original has a pretty long run time. The movie is a steal at $10 and the picture looks really good. If you are interested in history or action movies, this is definitely a movie to check out.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Blue-ray really adds to the visual action and enjoyment of the Alien series. Excellent quality. Only negative would be no extras included - just 3 DVD's in a colorful box.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a fun app that lets you use logic (as well as some trial and error) Otto solve maze like puzzle.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Will buy book three the first day it becomes available on Kindle. Probably the single most comprehensive book I have ever ready on a single subject. I am going to have to try some of Folletts other books.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|The movie was horrible.  In no way does it compare with it's previous movies.  Also the picture kept stopping and starting up again at strange intervals.  I have no idea what caused it but all my equipment is working for everything else.  Overall I am extremely dissapointed in the whole thing.
0439023491|4.0|I wondered how author Suzanne Collins would continue with the story and I am pleased to say she did a wonderful job with this second book. These well loved characters gear up for the challenges they now face.<br /><br />After reading The Hunger Games, I knew a love triangle would form in this second book and as it did, the teeny bopper inside of me could not help but giggle with glee during the little romantic bits.<br /><br />Katniss is brave as ever, Peeta soft spoken and caring, and Gale fiercely protective. Katniss' mom and sister, Haymitch, Cinna, all play a role in this second book as we see these secondary characters develop a bit more now.<br /><br />Sometimes I find the female leads in YA fiction a tad annoying and flaky (Bella Swan, Twilight series) but with The Hunger Games, this is not the case at all. Even with the love triangle that is going on, Katniss is not annoying. There's no jumping back and forth from I love Gale to I love Peeta. She realizes she loves them both, even though it's all confusing to her. Her main concern is her family and her friends safety. She doesn't flit around like some obsessed twit unable to think of anything but boys while tripping over her own two feet and needing constant rescuing. *cough* *cough* Bella Swan.<br />Speaking of boys, I myself couldn't chose between Peeta or Gale. The author does a great job at making them both likable characters, each in their own way.<br /><br />\\"The sensation inside me grows warmer and spreads out from my chest, down though my body, out along my arms and legs, to the tips of my being. Instead of satisfying me, the kisses have the opposite effect, of making my need greater. I thought I was something of an expert on hunger, but this is an entirely new kind. It's the first crack of the lightning storm-the bolt hitting the tree at midnight-that brings us to our senses.\\"<br />p.352, Catching Fire<br /><br />I was happy to see Katniss and Peeta's mentor, Haymitch featured more in this installment.  In the first book, I didn't care for him much, this time around I found myself rooting for him.<br /><br />I have to mention, these books have violence within their pages. The dystopian world these characters live in is a harsh one and Collin's descriptive writing takes you right there.<br />I won't say too much so not to spoil the plot, but there's suspense, action and a bit of romance in this one. It's nice to find an author who can write stories that appeal to both kids and adults.<br /><br />I'll also mention that author Suzanne Collins has really added some great twists and turns here. I gasped out loud more than once while reading. I also like the world building. All the different districts stand out in some way, the Capitol and its people stand out as well and finally, the Arena where the Games take place is always interesting to read about.<br /><br />The Hunger Games trilogy so far has an entertaining storyline, endearing characters and action to boot. I recommend these books to fans of YA dystopia. I can't wait to read the final installment in the series. I have to see how it all wraps up.<br /><br />I purchased my copy of this book.

B002C6A6N6|3.0|I could find nothing wrong with the product itself. I ordered this because I like this series. I do however have a lot to say about the package it came in. My Mail man hand me a box with a rubber band around it, both the top and the bottom of the box were open, he was very upset about the condition of the box. He asked me to contact the company shipping it and complain.<br />Please see the fact that I am saying that the item is a great item, I guess you have to watch what company you order it through.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Blue-ray really adds to the visual action. Excellent quality both picture and sound. If you like the other Resident Evll movies you will like this. Recommend.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|these guys are true musicians.if you really don't care much for classical music, this stuff will change your mind.i can listen to it everyday.LOVE IT
030758836X|1.0|I hated it! Not real, too long, pathetic and badly written.. The characters were overdone and caricature-like. To me it is shocking how this novel can be on the best-seller list. Try something else..
B005JCT4B0|4.0|Great price for all these Pantera CDs.  Originally was looking for a best of CD but was able to get all these for the price of a typical compilation.
B008Y5OW20|4.0|Was curious about this cd.  Hopefully it will grow on me.  The first track is wonderful(She).<br />At Last, is well done.  The percussion section of this music sounds odd, out of place.  Something not quite right about it.  Jeff's voice is strong as ever and again shows his range.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this was a present for my mom and she absolutely loves green day, as do i. the songs aren't approved for children but i love it!
B001LPWGE6|5.0|Blue-ray really adds to the visual action of these classic movies.Comes in an interesting box. Challenge is to figure out how to open it. Answer - pull up on inside edge of Bourne picture!
B009P13RQY|5.0|The Sword are everything nu metal bands want to be. The riffs are dead on, the vocals aren't screamo crap & the lyrics make sense.
0345803485|2.0|I like Zane better!  He stories get juicer and more colorful.  I didn't get that feeling after reading this book, disappointed.  A zane wanna be.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones really are amazing actors.  It isn't on my topp 10 movie list, but I did enjoy it.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I tried this item and after getting it downloaded tried to put in a location.  Nothing happened.  If you live in Los Angeles, you would maybe like this as this is the only site it will do anything with and even that it gives only the name and does not give temp or anything else on it.  Overall, save your money and get something else or you can get this and waste your money as I did.  If I had known before I downloaded it what I do now, I would have left it alone and gone elsewhere.
B000N2HCKQ|1.0|How can a Kindle book be more expensive than a paperback? At the time of this review the Kindle version was sold at $13.99 and the paperback was $7.41.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Well Built and not too expensive. I only wish this was included with the Kindle. Just like anything else. I guess, the options are what cost ya.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We bought this ahead of time and were like kids on Christmas morning when it came.It is beautiful and moving. Thank you for sharing your talent with us and giving us music that spans the generations as well as inspires us. We brought three of our kids and their spouses to your concert and they all bought this CD as well as others and love them. Again thank you for music that is so good for the  soul.
B005D643PO|5.0|DO I need to say more? If you are reading this then you are unsure. I assure you this show is the best!
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Ok, so I have to admit that I am an &#34;Alien Junkie&#34;. I saw all these films when they were first released in theatres oh so many years ago. I bought all the director cuts when they were relased on VHS tape and even when they were put on regular DVD disks. From a quality and packaging standpoint this set is absolutely top rate. The book like package is a brilliant idea. As for the disks, I had no problems at all till I got to the third disk and my Sony bluray player regected it saying that I needed a &#34;software upgrade&#34; to play it. This is Sony's fault, not the producers of this package set. That is my only complaint and the reason I rated it four stars. Otherwise, this is one fantastic package and a good addition to any Alien fan.
0307594165|2.0|As a reader of Beloved, Jazz, Paradise, I found myself very disappointed at this book. It's more like an outline of a complex story; a story that is not yet finished. It lacks Morrison's signature depth and humanity and perspective. totally disappointed.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Because I love the show<br /><br />I like the way they mix fun and a hard job,and also how well the cast and crew is working.<br />Also the tension between Beckett and Castle is exiting to watch.<br /><br />Som of the scenes cold have a bit more light...please.  :-))<br /><br />And yes I will recommend it..
0525478817|5.0|This book was so amazing that I just HAD to write a review for it.<br />I had seen this book around for around for awhile and I never stopped to read the description or even look at it. Not even realizing I was missing out. So a few days ago I decided to pick it up. And I am so glad that I did.<br />I just felt that Hazel and Augustus story was so beautiful yet so tragic. I felt so connected to them, like I was experiencing whatever they were going through. It's not very often that I feel this way about characters. I laughed with them, cried with them and so on.<br />In the end, I loved The Fault in our Stars and I will definitely read it again (hopefully with less tears). :)
1400067820|5.0|Nassim Taleb is great! This book is very different from the earlier ones - takes a lot longer to read and makes you think alot.<br />Also he is definitely into telling little stories - if you like that sort of thing..
0756697875|5.0|My grandson (just turned 8) was completely absorbed by this book immediately after opening it! He adores LEGOS and Superhero Batman. it comes with a miniature LEGO Batman figure and features all the LEGO sets having to do with Batman and other Superheroes.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|For anyone who has watched this series from the beginning there is not much to add. It is very well produced and has a very interesting story line. I applaud the producers for keeping this series fresh with ever more intriguing plot lines.
B009RH9FR6|2.0|Okay, before I mention what is wrong with this case, I will mention two things that are right:<br /><br />1. The leather feels so soft.  For a mass produced case, they did a good job at this aspect.<br /><br />2. The strap, which I am going to call a negative down below, does look cool if you are thinking of your KFHD as an ebook reader because it resembles the straps that are sometimes found in books.<br /><br />Okay, done with the good.  Now for the critique:<br /><br />1. The spine likes to stay open.  By that I mean when you open the device and then close it you have to use the strap to hold it shut because it will not do so naturally.  Since the device turns on and off when you open and close it, this means that the device will waste power staying on because it thinks that the case is open.  There are many ways to avoid this, but they manufacturer did not try to.<br /><br />2. There are no pockets to put note cards or business cards.<br /><br />3. There is no loop to hold a stylus or pen.<br /><br />4. The case is open around all sides.  This isn't a design flaw, but if I were the company I would offer a zippered version to protect the device from rain.<br /><br />5. The strap SUCKS!!!  I mean really, it takes effort to properly close this case!  Why not design it not to need one like my Toshiba Thrive case, or design it with a magnetic clasp like my Kindle Touch case?<br /><br />6. The rotating mechanism is pretty cool, I have seen similar for other devices, but it is pretty tight.  Perhaps this will loosen up, but after 3 days I still report this to be difficult to turn.<br /><br />7. The hand strap is useless.  If you hold it open like that, the device is secured only to one side and can flap about.  If you are going to put in a hand strap, this should provide secure and stable device placement.<br /><br />8. And now for the most annoying factor:  they get a point for designing a case that can sit at several angles, but then loose several million for designing it so that NONE of those angles are comfortable.  They range from pointing slightly down to pointing slightly up, and all of them are best if the device is at or within 6\\" below eye level.  If you sit it on your desk and not a long way off, it is not angled enough for a good view!  Seriously?  Didn't they test this before going into production?<br /><br />My advice to the user is to find another case.<br /><br />My advice to the manufacturer is to redesign.  And while you're at it, please send me a free one of the new cases after the redesign so that I don't have to buy a new case!<br /><br />One more word about the price.  I know that this is a high end case with the rotating feature and all, but anything over $30 is just ridiculous!  I got mine free in exchange for this review (sorry about that, but I am always fair and I have never been bribed in my reviews), but I wouldn't have paid for it if I had to do so!ng it so that NONE of those angles are comfortable.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|I like the story of Les Mis  It is a classic story and a good one. I have never read the book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My grandson introduced me to this game and I am so addicted.  It is fun, fun.  I just wish their were more grids before you had to buy them.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|HAVE ONLY FOUND A COUPLE OF THINGS, eg: when reading through a chapter and press arrow to next chapter it takes you to the last verse of the next chapter, and you have to scroll up to begin at the first chapter. if you scroll up before you touch the arrow it will go to the correct spot.
B0049VZ222|4.0|This is another series I have been watching that has very interesting plot lines. Although I have only borrowed these DVDs from friends I would certainly recomend buying it if you can't borrow it first.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I couldn't get myself into that hazily depicted world and shallowly constucted characters.  The world itself needs a lot deeper, fuller, & richer identity for me to be able to relate to it or its characters with any depth of interest and connection.  I recognize that it is geared to the young, but I don't think it gives the young credit for much to bring to it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|The Castle show is great,in so many levels,and it is funny,exciting an the Castle an crew is fantastic.<br /><br />I liked the show.<br /><br />Of couse I will recommend the show to friends and fam.  :-))
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am a De Mille fan and was eagerly looking forward to this latest book. Well, while it is set in a different country and there is almost an over-emphasis on the Yemen dysfunction, what bothered me about this was that essentially it was an extreme extrapolation of some of his previous work, notably the Lion. It was predictable, the outcome was not a surprise, the inner dialogue used too many of his previous approaches. His wife came across as an accessory and did not play a meaningful role in the plot, neither in execution nor even as a foil for Corey's usual sexual proclivities.<br /><br />There were so many ways that the basic premises of this book could have been expounded or developed, certainly there were possibilities. Unfortunately De Mille did not pursue most of them all that well, hence the low rating. Perhaps if you had never read any of his other stuff you'd really like it, but considering his body of work, this just feels forced and rides the reputation.<br /><br />You can do better Nelson!
B0076DELIG|4.0|The beat goes on.  Bosch never gets boring and Connelly somehow manages to write storylines that are fresh, compelling and today.
B009OA57MI|2.0|This app is well done. Its stable and has never crashed. It has given me hours of fun and i think its great that you can download scenarios others have made. This is so far the best action game I have found for android. It has great graphics considering its being run on a phone.  The only change i would make is combinding it with f/18 carrier landing. That should be part of this game instead of two different games to purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE-I would easily give this game a better ranking, however i have emailed the devs for tech support twice and have never herd back. Shame on you rortos for not supporting your product. Their motto shoud be sell it and forget it. Sad because this is one of the better android games out there but if you have issues or questions you are on your own. If i ever get a response i will update my review
6304698623|1.0|The DVD was rattling around in the case, so I opened it to see if it was OK.  There were a few scratches, but I popped it into the DVD player anyway.  The quality was very poor.  Black dots and lines throughout the movie.  I will be returning this.
0307455874|3.0|As a follow up to his very engaging autobiography this book was a huge and boring disappointment to me. It reads way too much like pure campaign rhetoric.  I find it much easier to like the man than to like his politics or his rhetoric, so I didn't care for this book at all.
0345803507|1.0|I'm just starting the book, read the previous two and they're just AMAZING! i know this one will be too. The only problem was the book it's self. It was cut short on the front and back cover, you were able to see white around the edges (the inside pages). It was horrible. The book wasn't wrapped, it was just thrown in the box and by the time it got to me it was all scratched all over the front cover - horrible. 5 stars for the book and 1 star for the presentation and the seller. Who ever put the binding on these books did a horrible job!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I am a Follett fan and this one did not disappoint. It covers a section of history that is full of content, intrigue, passions and predjudices that seem almost unbelieveable from the 21st century perspective. While Ken takes a few liberties with history as he needs to, I liked all the characters, the plots and sub-plots and could hardly put it down.
B008SVFX96|5.0|I love this cd.Seven years gone has so many meanings. Richie's voice soars and the guitars are flying free. He puts his feeling out there for all the world to see.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Every person in the USA should see this movie.  These men risk their lives each and every day just to keep our borders safe and free from terrorist.  The Navy Seals are awesome!  I have the utmost respect for them and their counterparts in the other branches of the service.  The boat scene is my favorite part.  What a mission they had!!!
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Well, what can you say about men in black.  Lots of new creatures and a meaner meanie.  Add a tear jerker scene, retrograde memories back to 1969 and a surprise ending.  Of course I am in love with the Miami Comic character in this movie.  Nothing more can be said...I am in love with the visionary Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg).
1594200823|3.0|Lots of fascinating facts leading to an extreme point of view.  Basically too long and intense to suit my interest in the subject.
0345803493|5.0|AMAZINGGGGG i am now starting the final book. I love the trilogy and cant wait for the next! It was so good, i couldn't stop reading. Finished in one day, just as i did with the first book.
B001BKV9TE|5.0|I really liked this movie. Loved the computer animations. This movie had been out for a while and we had missed it earlier on, found it and decided to watch it.<br />Well worth the watch is all I can say.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|After reading previous POSITIVEly glowing reviews, I gave this a chance. Didn't realize the real action only started about 40-50 minutes in. Don't get me wrong, I realize how a thin plot and characters can ruin a movie (e.g., Transformers, Clash of the Titans) but the time spent on character development seemed, well, overwrought. The CGI is good, when it occurs, but it doesn't save the movie. I wouldn't recommend getting this movie at the current price ($4).
0743490304|5.0|Deception point by Dan Brown was fast-paced, full of action & interesting.<br />The story had a Clever plot, with believable characters.
030759565X|4.0|Book was pre ordered so it seemed to take a month to even be in and shipped.  Nice picture of some of the disihes. Interesting recipes with different ingredients.  Disappointed that a lot of the recipes had ingredients I'm not familiar with or stock in my pantry, probably not a book I will use unless I need or wnat to fix something really different.
0785163174|2.0|This is an example how superhero comics lost their way. A good idea, a good beggining but a completely ordinary development and a cheap closure. AVX exists just to put the two teams against each other, there is no purpose here of telling a good story or developing any character or relationship at all. I remember Claremont and Byrne Dark Phoenix Saga and I miss that kind of fun so much. Please pick up the original Phoenix sotry, not this oversized and boring edition.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Watched it due to great ratings, but my wife and I hated it so much we didn't even finish watching.
1419705849|5.0|My 9 year old son loves all of these books. I am glad to have books that he will read willingly.
0811879542|5.0|Adults will even have a hard time not following directions to see what happens on the next page! I can see this one becoming a favorite with my grandkids.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie. We were pleased with the storyline, the acting was good, and the effects were good as well. We weren't sure what to expect but we're very pleased overall.
1423399994|4.0|I really liked this one and as a dog owner as a boy, I can say that the information here is accurate.<br />Arrived on time and in excellent shape - I will use this seller again.
0385536828|5.0|SWEET TOOTH by Ian McEwan~~Spies.  Romance.  Religion.  Betrayal.  And books.  Oh, the books.  This novel is everything and more.  Set in the early 1970's in Britain, Serena Frome (rhymes with plume) finds herself an employee of the British Security Service, MI5.  Sent on a covert mission into the literary world~~a world in which she was groomed to enter~~she meets Tom Haley.  A writer.  A lover.  What you read on the first page is such a teaser for the journey Mr. McEwan takes us on along with his fascinating characters.  Not just a love story with spies.  This book is so much more.  A book for lovers of books.  This is the first of this author's works that I have read.  What a way to start my literary love affair with Mr. McEwan.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Not historically accurate but oh sooooo romantic. I loved the soundtrack as well. Fabulous costumes and sets. Tissues please for the rest &#60;3
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Awesome, jam-packed adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat kind of cool! You just gotta watch it!
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My kids love this app. they can do all they want with coloring. Not just for toddlers my kids are 6 and 7. they are always on this app.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I got this to watch with my wife and kid based on previews I had seen, thinking it would be more of a family comedy in the silly, of the wall Burton styled. I was wrong ; turned out more like the Addams family, but more adult humor (\\"death becomes her\\" comes to mind). My incorrect assumption aside, I still didn't think it was very good. Not Burton or Deposit best.
B002GHHHPQ|4.0|Great War Movie<br />Great footage of old warfare and films of warfare tactics<br />One of the many war fils members of my Post have asked for to watch.<br />Arrived on time and in excellent shape - I will use this seller again.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I always thought that you can never go wrong with a Rihanna album...This one is no different.  I love her music!
B002CLBJPK|5.0|We' ve seen the movie many times and we still love it. Great if you liked Mary Poppins and enjoyed the cartoon/real actor mix.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Amazing. You get both physical and digital copies. Highly recommended. Dark knight rises, to own it would cost you $15.00 alone, just for the digital copy.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app for your phone to always give you heads up as to how much life you have in your battery! I would highly recommend this item to all cell-phone users!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Sticks with the general theme of the batman movies: pretty good story line, good special effects, really cool batman toys.
B002NLU0AY|5.0|I started watching the show about 3 months ago. I have seen shows in all seasons at present. Season 5 is by far some of the best TV I have seen in the last 5 years. Watching later shows it appears season 5 was the zenith of the show. It's still a very good show(season 8), but season 5 excells and can be compared to any great TV series past and present.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Everything she touches is gold!!  I love that this album shows how much she's grown vocally.  I think that every song could be a hit.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This was a great book. Way better than most of the books you get at this price. Should be a best seller.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Even with an older windows desktop it is a cheap thrill to remotely operate from the Kindle Fire. Even the three finger key salute remotely power off.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love the price for this movie!  The product arrived on time and will be a perfect extra just because Christmas gift to a friend that has not seen the movie yet!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a fast and entertaining read, albeit predictable.  I haven't read a Grisham novel in a while and wanted something I could read quickly and not have to think to much.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great, better than the two previous books. Worth buying the hardcover over digital for reference materials inside to use later.
B006O6F932|5.0|I ordered this Monster High house for my daughter after she insisted that it was all she wanted for Christmas. Not only was the delivery quick and as promised, but the pricing was about $10.00 cheaper than I was finding it in stores. 5 stars!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|works as stated would buy one again + + + + + + + + + + + + +
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I could  say  in very simple way... Just buy it and you will see themselves. I recommend  that book for everyone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this app ....recipes ...diy .....things I love, want ....can't wait to find more recipes ....I love to bake and this app is awesome
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love Son's Of Anarchy.  The writing and acting are fabulous and you can't second guess Kurt Sutter.  I hate that you have to wait nine months between seson's.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Flynn is at his best. On track with all the action and suspense he's become great at. The only down side to starting a new book from Flynn is it has to end at some point. As with all the Mitch Rapp series you don't want it end! No matter how much sleep you've lost, you don't want to set it down unroll you have to!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I truly liked this movie It had alot of action The story was put together great It had a story line about not having family Superb to sum it up
B009SMW9IW|2.0|Very little reason to buy this one. Most of the tracks did not do much for me. I like the version of Skating, but it pales next to Joni's original, and this is probably a way to look at the entire album. It's OK, but you probably have better versions of most of the material by other artists.
B005PK5C12|2.0|I went into this one with high hopes...there are some good things about it, but overall, there are huge plot holes, unforgivable inconsistencies and poor, poor writing.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is great, as is Connie Briton.  But their efforts can't make up for bad writing and a poorly thought out story.<br /><br />The final episode is just...bad!  It's like the story finished with writing from a 12 year old.  I can't describe to you how disappointed I was in this show.  Forget the 4.5 stars, by the time you get to the end, you will regret it.<br /><br />It is a violent, warped show at times, but that is not why it sucks...it's just BAD.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I found the advertisements to be distracting and occasionally in the way.  Felt like I wasted battery power of commercials.
B008RTE066|5.0|I think this is an ideal release of a Beatles classic. Perfectly done, I even began liking the movie :) And the vinyl replica of the original EP is a wonderful bonus!!!
B008OURHPY|5.0|This is Lianne La Havas first full CD.  Her voice and guitar playing are awesome for someone in her early twenties.  The title track &#34;Is Your Love Big Enough?&#34;, is the question put to her by her manager after noticing that the young singer was starting to gain a larger following of her music.  He wanted to know if she had enough love or passion for the things that are on the horizon for her....she is blowing up!  I don't want to attempt to categorize her sound, other than to say it is worth the adventure.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|This series arrived without incident No thanks to UPS. Looking forward to viewing the series. As Spok says, &#34;Live long and prosper.&#34;
B008NW67E0|5.0|this album is phenomenal i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys great music. the melody is amazing and it is all in all very relaxing
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Exceeded expectations.... not only an hour and a half of great dance scenes and attractive leads but BONUS- a pretty decent story line! A sure thing for fans of SYTYCD and previous Step Up movies. :)
B004SBX112|3.0|Since I am new to the game.... I am finding SEASONS quite difficult. Graphics are quite cute. I think it's ridiculous that you have to put a certain numbers of words on these rates.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The additional 16 minutes of footage was well worth the cost of me replacing the existing version of Avatar that I already had.
B004CAWR8M|5.0|Joe Sample is his usual innovative, piano grooving self.  However, it's even better with the soulful singing of Randy Crawford.  They are a perfect match and a joy to listen to.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I'm not finished reading the book, but so far I've really been enjoying it. It does take some thought to read; it's not exactly a page turner. However, for those willing to approach with patience, it's totally worth it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys don't play great music.  They speak volumes with their instruments.  There is a point where a musician ceases to \\"play\\" their instrument and begins to express themselves through it.  Jon and Steven passed that point long ago, and their obvious joy and passion for their work is impossible to miss.  I listen to a pretty wide variety of music, but when I want to just sit and let go of everything and listen, I listen to The Piano Guys.
B009JBZH54|5.0|So awesome, this is a steal. One blu-ray dvd is almost $30 itself.  Comes in a sweet box too. Definitely get!!!!
B00004TVG7|5.0|This is so unusual and we just love listening to it or enjoying it as background.  It invoked images of Troy or the sounds one would expect from ancient Greece.  Wonderful.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|i really loved this book. the twists are non-stop and the story is really engaging and creative. i wish i had more of this author's work to read. it was a refreshing blast of story that i plan on reading several more times and highly recommend.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|On many of the reviews I read before purchasing some buyers had problems setting up the printer. It was very easy with the instructions. Within 10 minutes the printer was up and working. No wires.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is very accurate and it tells me when my battery is getting low and it also lets me change the settings
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is so well-written, well-acted, well-developed...just amazing.  I'm so happy that a friend introduced me to this show and have been able to catch up with all the seasons very quickly.  I never knew what I was missing but I'm so glad I know now!!
B005JCT4B0|5.0|I love Pantera since I was younger and this series is the one that I have always wanted. Listening to all the studio versions is amazing. I recommend it and I think it could not be better.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|This was the best cd. I cannot wait for his next one. Fantastic guitarist and singer. Come back to DC.
0671646788|3.0|This is a good read.  I like they way he thinks and how to apply it in every aspect of your life.
1451695195|3.0|Like anything experienced in the spiritual realm, describing the experience is difficult. Language is very limited when describing what is a meta-physical experience and at times, sounds supercilious and shallow. But it's important to try. After reading Proof of Heaven, I felt like the really important proof, the author's actual experience on the other side, was distinctly missing. We do get a great idea of what his medical condition actually was, and that he could not, according to western medicine, been making up this experience. His brain was dead.<br />  I would have liked more details about his energetic experiences and how they impacted his perspective of life. He does tell us we need to meditate, but those of us who had a spiritual life in this life, already knew that. All in all, there are better NDE books written by everyday people.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|the actors do not turn in as powerful a performance as heath ledgers joker but this story is far and away tremendously outstanding. a bit sad however that this wonderful series has to come to an end and not at all looking forward to the next adaptation - the dark knight trilogy cannot be topped!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|My nephew recommended this trilogy, and I literally raced through the first two books.  Fall of Giants begins in the early 20th century and moves through World War I.  The characters are a mixture of English, Russian and German characters who can be followed through the next book that begins in 1933 when Hitler comes to power in Germany and ends in the early 1950s as the Russians acquire the atomic bomb.  Both are a phenomenal read.  Although as a history major, I know the basics fairly well, I still learned much detail from this detailed book.  I definitely came to care for the characters.  THe only drawback is having these character be in the right or wrong place.  For example, one family happens to be at Pearl Harbor the morning of Dec. 7, 1941.  Still, the books are a remarkable achievement and are easily accessible for those who do not enjoy history as I do.
B0091LRZZW|1.0|This album is just as bad as run devil run, you are better off just buying one song. Im a huge Mc Cartney fan and i got to say after his Album off the ground i been displeased with his music. I dont like the song my valentine. he is trying so hard to get a number 1 hit that his music is getting bad. You also know he does his own drums and gutairs and piano in the studio. When you have 3 or 4 other musicans it brings in a chemistry and thats how a great song is made. Im not going to buy this album or any future one, Sorry Paul your age has gotten up with your music. i like your concerts but no more new songs.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|I bought this, but a lot of the dvd's were defectives so I requested an exchanged. The other package has the same exactly defective dvds.  I guess I will have to buy them separately...Not happy about that.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i love it but dont get the update it camfusing i hate the up date but i rilly love it :-)
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I love all the Percy Jackson books... and I'm 30 years old. ... This book has new main characters, but the other loved characters from Camp Half Blood are still part of the book. .. And this book sets up the next few in the series where you will get to see lots more of Annabeth and Percy. I was nervous at first to have new characters because I loved Percy Jackson and the Olympians so much, but this book and series is great and the perfect continuing story of all the characters!
B009IF7V2S|3.0|Decent movie. Not the best comedy ever, but still entertaining. Many consider this a classic comedy, but after watching it twice, I still can only give it a 3/5. Different strokes I suppose.
B004P8A7J2|5.0|a great film in HD at a great price. im loving amazons instant video service more & more. if your a fan of this film you will be satisfied with this high quality (audio & video) HD version.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This new Intel 3570k was an excellent choice. Is expensive comparing it to AMD Quad or Six Core Processors, but its performance worth it.<br />Applications load fast as hell. No hangs out. DRR3 1600Mhz and PCIe 3.0 support.<br />Plus all that, the Intel HD Graphics 4000 GPU is excellent to. It can handles games as GTA IV on medium specs easily, no Overcloack needed. So if you're on budget, saving a while for the Graphics Card, or your Card crashed (as mine did) you'll have no problem.<br /><br />The only detail is that the stock cooler is not the best. Does a good job, but can be better. Cooler Master Vortex Plus CPU Cooler is a nice option I just bought.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|Fun game..but kept getting interrupted during play to watch these 20 second commercials. I understand that this is the free version and I didn't mind the ads in Angry Birds, but this is just obnoxious.<br /><br />I uninstalled.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I really liked seeing Annabeth and Percys relationship more in this book. Plus lots of action as always! I'm just sad I have to wait a year for the next book in the series. I'm ready to keep reading now!
B000I9X9HY|4.0|The Presido<br /><br />The first time I saw Mark Harmon in a movie.  I like him a lot.  Always watch NCIS.
B008G33NFC|5.0|The dvd set is great!  Awesome quality.  Would recommend to any Tarja/ old school nightwish fan.  Really wish she would come to the US for a tour!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|You won't be surprised to find out that things look much as they did in Lord of the Rings. You'll recognize the peaceful, scenic Shire and Bilbo's burrow. McKellen comes across as ageless in the role of Gandalf, looking for all the world as he did as Gandalf the Grey in Fellowship. As the movie progresses, the dramatic landscapes of New Zealand will also be familiar, as the adventurers travel far to reach the ancient Dwarven home, Eredor ... now known as the Lonely Mountain.<br /><br />For any who don't know, the set up for \\"The Hobbit\\" is thus: Decades ago a dragon chased the dwarves out of their prosperous mountain home. With the dragon not having been seen in 60 years, a group of dwarves including the heir to their throne decide the time is right to check out the ancestral city. Gandalf decides they are correct to do so. He enlists Bilbo, a hobbit, to be their \\"burglar\\" for the expedition. His reasons for this unusual choice are explained as you watch the film.<br /><br />I haven't read the book in a long time, and I don't want to provide spoilers, but if there were any details left out from the part of the story told in Unexpected Journey, I'd be surprised. We're going to have 8 to 9 hours devoted to the telling of \\"The Hobbit\\", which isn't nearly as expansive a tale as the Lord of the Rings books. The filmmakers allowed the story to take great patience with teaching us the history and introducing various characters.<br /><br />The CGI is just as seamless as in the Lord of the Rings. Your suspension of disbelief whether a troll, orc, worg, or goblin is in your face will be complete. The action scenes are lavish, extended, and frenetic. In fact they were maybe a touch too frenetic, making for some very large differences between the very slow pacing of establishing scenes and the frantic action of the battles.<br /><br />The movie goes to great lengths to try to satisfy everyone, from purist fans of the books to a general public who may know nothing about \\"The Hobbit\\" other than it is a \\"prequel\\" to Lord of the Rings. It may do a little TOO much to fill all plates. A dwarven song near the beginning of the movie was enough of a lullaby to have me nodding before it was done. LOL The riddle game between Bilbo and Gollum possibly was too generously paced. It is a bit like you are getting the \\"extended version\\" right from the start with this film.<br /><br />There are some terrifying sequences here, and those scenes may not be suitable for young children. Orcs are just as unattractive in this film as in Lord of the Rings, and the close ups of goblins, especially the Goblin King, might be enough to make some just a bit queasy.<br /><br />These are small quibbles. This is one impressive movie. It will grab your attention and keep it (unless the dwarves put you to sleep with their lullaby and no one pokes you to wake you back up!). The character building, with its relaxed pace, gives you a real sense of getting to know most of the dwarves, along with Galdalf and Bilbo. There is a very strong growth of character in this film for Bilbo, and in his relationship with his unexpected traveling companions.<br /><br />You were going to go see this film anyway, but for the record ...<br /><br />Highly recommended.bit\\" other than it is a \\"prequel\\" to Lord of the Rings.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like it a lot the only thing that sucks about it is all the damn pop ups.<br />I guess I can't complain about it though because I have the free version
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is the second book in the Heroes of Olympus series, and I'm so glad that Percy is back in the story! I was so into the Greek story that learning about the Romans was hard at first, but it's all important for the rest of the series. Great book, I highly suggest you read it, no matter what age.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|I have to say that I stumbled across &#34;In This Moment&#34; by way of XM radio and bought this CD based on the song &#34;Blood&#34; and now I can't seem to take it out of my CD player. I listen to it on the way to work and on the way home from work everyday. (My drive one way is 45 minutes) Maria Brink is a VERY talented singer and the band rocks. I'm blown away by this album. I look forward to more music from &#34;In This Moment&#34; and I'd HIGHLY recommend this to everyone. (In fact I have via Facebook)
B0006GAI6Y|1.0|This is a poor, nasty, in my mind, copy of the original.japanese version.  No class! No class! No class! No class!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Every since the new update I cannot open anything without it shutting down. I love this game but will have to delete if gameloft can't get it together already. So many people are having the same issue yet there has not been a fix. I cannot play something that is not able to be player to its entirety. Please fix these glitches so that we may all go back to playing our favorite game.
B008J9EYFG|5.0|I have been a fan of Beth Orton for many, many years. It is great to have new music from her.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I'm 30 years old and I love the Percy Jackson series. ... all the books in this series and in the new Hero's of Olympus Series are all worth reading. I've had a hard time putting this book down, just like all the others. I highly suggest you read it and all the Percy Jackson books.
031620157X|1.0|I wish authors wouldn't drag out a chapter.  I hope wanna be authors read this.  Colfer needs to stick to acting and needs to never write again not that I ever watched him.  The book is a drag the plot is bad and everything is too predictable.  People who give this a good review have to be fans of his.  I agree if he wasn't famous this book probably wouldn't have happened.  If I were you I wouldn't pay a penny for this book.
B003B02OOG|1.0|I was VERY disappointed.  I've read all of Grisham's novels and consider him a master story teller and, at times, a supporter of good causes.  But these stories were drivel.  I read the first two, about stupid, lazy Mississippi guys getting drunk and acting up, and found them pointless.  I didn't read the other stories ... have better things to do.  Grisham should stick to longer stories where he has time to develop real plots!
B001O9CR3O|5.0|One reason I am glad I bought that DVD player is because this is in PAL format. The first song twenty zero one lets you know these guys arent goofing around. I have never heard jazz, funk and driving rock played so well. The musicians are all powerful on their instruments. Of course Jay Kay delivers great vocals to intertwine between all the heavy beats and great hooks. Canned Heat follows the first song and on it goes.<br /><br />We also have the classic rain storm but unlike Woodstock, Jay Kay did not initiate a rain chant so it kept raining.........and the band played on. They played on without any compromise to the performance in fact because this band did troop on so well, it probably added to the show. Those in the audience I am sure will tell you it did push the whole show up a notch.<br /><br />I think this is infectous and dont see how anyone could not like at least one song on this. Get it.
B00843TZJM|5.0|A Great sonic and visual delight. With golden ear speakers and a cambridge AVR, the sound is better than I heard at their<br />Westbury concert.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I liked this im not sure if i would say it was better than the first but it was nice to have all the big action stars in it even for how short of a time they were in it.  Overall i liked the movie and I would go see it again.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I did this game together with my son, whom is only 6, and it started with the haunt at Halloween. So he understands this is only a game, but since then we have been hooked.  This game you had to do a lot of back and forth it seemed, but with the hints it made it easier and we both found it very exciting and in depth. The object finding was also wonderful for his seek and find skills, also learning slot of new objects and what they look like.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Tom Hanks is my most favorite actor EVER, this movie was very different for him. He has a main role but the main actor is is his son. I sobbed during the movie and the funny thing was: I wasn't the only one! I do not think that there is any role out there that Tom Hanks can not do and do so very well!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|With all the Music, digital downloads, versions and extras that Marvel gives in this bundle, it makes watching the movie so much better than it already was!
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Reminiscent of Indy Jones. Never read Tin Tin before, so I can't comment on its &#34;authenticity&#34;. But this is a very entertaining story and it is visually beautiful.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm an educated women who isn't a prude by any stretch of the imagination. But I sincerely don't understand what all the fuss is about with this book.  It's not well written - I've seen better writing in some of the fan fiction on Wattpad, The main character, Ana, is seriously flawed. I have an issue with weak women - they make themselves into victims and Ana is a classic example. She spends the book whining about Christian and continues to allow him and others to manipulate and run all over her.  I was told I should read the 2nd and 3rd books to get closure but there's no way I can tolerate mediocre writing and such a wishy-washy character through two more books.  I'd lose my mind!  Supposedly this was an erotic book.  If it's considered that, I didn't see it because the Ana character ticked me off so much I couldn't get past my anger at the way the author portrayed her.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|I already knew and had all the songs by The Weeknd, I just bought the album because I like the artist, I wanted to support his work and to have an original copy of his first album.<br /><br />I am really glad that more and more people are starting to hear abut him and like his songs, I just hope he will not change now that he is going mainstream.<br />I think you can either love or hate Abel's songs, there is no middle way. You get attached to these songs and they become part of you and the way you feel.<br /><br />I love the album and I recommend it to other people that like good music.
030746363X|5.0|Ok, so i tried reading this book from cover to cover, it was difficult, the character development was had to follow, the story line was all over the place, but then i realized this book is like those choose your own adventure books i read as child. then the story got interesting, I went from learning how to exercise to pleasuring a women with my hands and mouth. It is pretty sweet read once you understand the format of the book
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly never misses. Just when it appears Harry Bosch is  done, he escapes by a pin (and with a little help from his &#34;enemy.&#34;)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Once you start, you won't be able to put it down.  It is told in a unique perspective by different characters as the story unfolds.  I'm only 3/4 through and my husband has to pry it out of my hands at night so I can get a few hours of sleep.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B001HZK8FY|5.0|I watch this movie about one a month.  It was a superb love story transcending generations, with the best cast....Allie and Noah in past and present.
B00001NTXN|5.0|Excellent game for all ages!....easy to learn altho a challenge to play it at ones best. Game takes about 15 minutes and can be fun after an initial getting use to it period. Enjoy!
B002BJGYU8|5.0|In a strange twist of events my girlfriend wanted the second season after i purchased the first season for her.<br /><br />I have yet to watch an episode of the gilmore girls but from what I overheard while my girlfriend was watching was the show is based on the aftermath of a war, the girls have become fast talking, sarcastic, and hopelessly romantic. They are searching for their loved ones in the town of gilmore, My girlfriend has neither confirmed or denied my theories about what her show is about, so I believe I am correct in my assumption.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|This album is amazing as is Bruno Mars. Love his voice, lyrics, and presentation. He's such an amazing artist to listen to!
0316056863|4.0|I don't read a lot of nonfiction because I like to read a interesting plot with twists and bends where I cannot see the ending, but desperately want to reach it. If I know how it ends, I don't care about reading it nearly as much.<br /><br />Tina Fey's Bossypants begins chronicling her early life, and eventually leads to her early, struggling acting career. While, as an actor, it is nice to see that even Tina Fey once struggled with her career, I also know that she's going to make amazing things happen, so half of me completely gets every moment of panic, and half of me just doesn't buy it.<br /><br />Tina Fey is just as hilarious as you'd expect, her anecdotes are funny, but I find her lack of self confidence both adorable and annoying. Part of me thinks, hey, you have an Emmy-award winning show running 7 seasons, shut. up. And part of me is happy to know that I'm not the only one who suffers these cripping moments of artistic lack of self-worth.<br /><br />That being said, by the end of the book I wanted nothing more than to grow up to be exactly like Tina Fey. She is fierce, funny, and overall a normal person who works very hard at doing what she loves. It was inspiring reading her journey from a young girl hanging out with the theater weirdos to playing with the big boys and producing her own show. I loved that she struggled with everything that woman in the arts struggle with. How do you balance a family with a 80-hour-a-week schedule? Are you screwing up your child? If you have a second one, will you completely derail your career?<br /><br />I often read this book before an audition, because it made me happy instead of stressed and it also gave me a huge sense of empowerment being a woman in the arts. Thank you, Tina Fey, for showing me that this journey is full of many, many bumps but is in the end, worth it, and a hilarious ride.
B009ZQFSRA|5.0|Great Movie.  Very satisfed. Loved the actors and the story line.  Very interesting futuristic world.  Could almost see it happening.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|who hasn't seen breaking bad to watch it and call me the as soon as they finnish the 4th season.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|Dear Reader,<br /><br />I can only imagine you are one or two things, First you were born deaf and recently got a cochlear implant and can now hear. Congratulations on your new found world of hearing. I suggest picking up this album and enjoying it. Then pick up the beach boys Pet sounds album, you will enjoy that too. So now your thinking you weren't born deaf so where is your review. You dear reader are a damn idiot if you need a review to buy a beatles album. its the beatles, this one is good. just like the other ones are good.<br /><br />So its worth your 20 bucks and its remastered which sucks a little but honestly its not that big of a deal, you can't tell the difference between the remastered version and the original release, cause if you had the original release you wouldnt be buying this now would you.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|We didn't start watching this until the fifth season was going to begin....so we had to rent all of the season's until we finally got caught up. This is a brilliant series with outstanding acting. WARNING: This is not for the weak of heart or for children!!!
B005LAIH5O|5.0|I purchased this version of Wrath of the Titans for one of my other sons who prefers this version to the older oversion. He seems to think it is a better made movie than the earlier movie.

0060936223|5.0|My dad introduced me to Patty Smith as a very young age. Ive been a huge fan of her music since.  This book is beautiful. Its been my top recommendation for anyone I know to read.  Love is something that cant be defined and she so eloquently described the lasting love we can have for our friends and lovers.
0143116738|5.0|it was a gift, but my girlfriend loves this book,<br /><br />she said her passion was finding a new boyfriend who doesnt write reviews on amazon, while she grades tests
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Exceeded our expectations. Very gripping and makes you feel patriotic. The fact that this was done by regular people (not actors) I think really makes an impact.
B002JVWQT6|5.0|I purchased Modern Family for one of my sons. He loves the series and introduced me to it and I thought he would like it.
B004SBULWE|5.0|i'll never be without this app is i buy a device.  so easy to use, it's customizable and intuitive.  I highly recommend this app.

B008XG1X18|5.0|never had an error before and is speedy in refreshing.  i use this instead of going to my computer.  THAT is how awesome this app is.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This perfect would be perfect if it worked offline.  When I ordered it, I thought it was a downloadable single version.  When it is online;  the version can't be beat.  I truly love it.  I use it everyday.....as often as i can.<br /><br />But out and about; I need to go back to my strongs to study.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I enjoyed the charcter developement and plot developement.  Kept my interest in both main story line and side stories with interesting querks, and twists.
B009DJB9HC|4.0|I dont give out five stars very easily. This is a great record, better than their second release in my opinion, the musicianship is outstanding and Glenns vocals are great
B0058RN85O|5.0|I purchased this for one of my sons for Christmas. He had introduced me to the series and I knew he really liked it. I would not mind having a copy for myself.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I have never encountered an error with this app.  It's quick to update, easy to use and looks great!  I recommend this app.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven:  Once I started it I couldn't put it down.The author even thoroughly explained why common theories wouldn't apply to his experience.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have such amazing music!  They are so inspiring.  I play their music everywhere I go.  I even use it in my own classroom where my students beg me each day to play it.  It's great for anyone, anytime, anywhere! :)

B001BKVWYG|5.0|My husband has listened to nothing else since he received the CD! It's particularly meaningful if you saw the 60 Minutes piece or the movie.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Never had any issues and using this app is near effortless.  I use this as a dairy/progress tracker every night because nothing else compares.  I highly recommend.
1451695195|5.0|This was a very enjoyable book and loved reading about his experiences in heaven and the surprize at the end.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Love the movie it was hilarious! Thought it would be a bit more funny but that's with pretty much any movie now a days. Seth McFarland really out did himself with this one
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I thought it would be a little more dark like the Pc but this is one of the best and SCARIEST games I ever played.ok maybe not that scary BUT STILL IS.I would recommend it to anyone who like horror games.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|I bought this and gave to my four year old niece - she luvs it! Hello Kitty is such a cutie! Great present for all lil girls! I got it for a great price and received it in just a few days---I think I'm addicted to AMAZON!!!!!!! lol
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical Connelly/Borch mystery.  Recommend reading past books with this character to familiarize yourself with<br />  some of the characters.  Awaiting a follow up.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Is a gift for the father in law he loved it ,plays it all the time .postage was fast and painless

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is amazing! I bought it for my 13 year old daughter on her birthday (it came out right before her birthday), and she was so excited. We have been TPG fans since day 1, and we listen to this cd all of the time! It just has a way of making you happy when you feel down. Highly recommended!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Again Connelly has offered us readers a Harry Bosch homicide investigation stretching back over twenty years to a time and to events anyone over forty rememders too well,  This is ma page turner that as always is to be savored, and one that again left me sorry it waqs finished and hungry for the next one.  I particularly enjoyed the combination of the old mystery with the modern and very human interaction with Bosch's daughter and his sometimes girlfriend..  I've read all of Connelly's novels, and this one does not disappoint,<br /><br />M. Lindsley
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I use a Kindle reader and the Kindle android app on my phone.  I love these books.  They are some of my favorites.  It was great to have them on kindle because I have access to all of them without carrying around 2000 pages.  I was cruising through the first book and everything was great.  But here is where the problem came in.<br /><br />The first book ends at page 695.  As the second book began my page progress froze at 695.  My progress bar and position advances but it stays on page 695.  Now Im almost done with the second book and it looks like it will stay 695 for the third.  There was an updated version that I thought &#34;Yay, this will solve my problem&#34;.  But after downloading it the problem remained.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is so addicting! I got this game a few days ago. Ever since then, I have been playing it non-stop! My parents keep yelling at me every time that they see me playing it! Great game, but but it's really not worth $6.99. It has really bad graphics, so sometimes it cab be pretty confusing. Other than that, minecraft RULES!
B004LWZW24|5.0|I saw this movie in the movie theater and I said to myself when it comes out on dvd I have to get it. I bought and I watch every now and then. It is a must see great movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My Granddaughter who is six loves it. It is very easy to play, without adult supervision.<br />Good choice for her.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|I was excited to see this.  It was visually appealing and the story was compelling but it left me wanting much more.  Won't buy.
B000I0QK74|1.0|normally I can purchase anything by James Taylor and I love it... But this cd, waist of money!!!<br />Don't waste your time.
B004G600A4|5.0|Up there as one of my favorite movies ever (at worst, it's in second place) - the characters and story development are nothing short of magical.  Add Alan Menken doing the music, and you have a winning combination!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I bought this album because I heard her song on the radio and I had to get the ablum. The ablum is very live and emotional and I love it B album are always great.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love this CD; it has something for everyone! The Piano Guys have created an amazing mix of classical and modern music that transcends age and crosses boundaries like no other music I've heard. Looking forward to more from this group of piano guys!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am not sure if there is anyone on this planet who thinks this movie is bad.  Its a great movie!  The 3D was great and the extras are worth it.  I love this movie!!!!
0544045203|5.0|VERY NICE!!!!!!!!! It is really good quality! It is really worth, and the price is reasonable. I hate typing long review but you should definitely check this out!
0805047905|5.0|I grew up reading this book, and the brilliance of Eric Carle and Bill Martin Jr. comes through well through this story.  Once you read it, you will never forget it!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|These puzzles make you think INSIDE the box and the answer is not always obvious.  Very challenging and still fun.  Enjoy!
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|A top notch page turner and great finale to one of the best action, suspense series I have ever read.
B003EI2EH2|4.0|I like that it's written in a way that jumping around from topic to topic can help you accomplish what your after. The cocktails are interesting, do any of these methods produce long term results? Who knows? But the joy of the pursuit makes it a great read.
1400052181|5.0|VERY NICE!!!!!!!!! It is really good quality! It is really worth, and the price is reasonable. I hate typing long review but you should definitely check this out!
B0085BHHOS|5.0|I am in Mexico and here we can´t find the album, it arrived at time and now I am very satisfied with it!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|As a big fan of Anderson's Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, and even a fan of The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, I had high hopes for Moonrise Kingdom, especially given the positive reviews - an 84! on Metacritic.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Moonrise Kingdom. Still trying to figure out what it was about: first love? pre-teen angst? precociousness? how parents/adults scar their and other kids? the soul crushing evils of living under the boot licking heel of the pseudo- boy scout state (to paraphrase Big Wednesday)?<br /><br />It was the weakest of stories IMO, with more than pedestrian dialogue. Now, perhaps non-fans of Anderson's works would make the same complaints about his other movies, some of which, like Rushmore, I think are great movies. But Moonrise Kingdom to me comes across as a half-assed effort at story-teling and film making.<br /><br />YMMV
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Writing is awesome, acting is great and the suspense is exhilarating! It is so convenient to but online and watch it over my Roku box!
B0041CGOZS|5.0|i got this gift for my wife for christmas she enjoys listening to it. i couldn't be more happier with my purchase.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Fun and easy game.  My cat loves it too!  She loves watching the cards move across the screen and she also likes to tap on the screen to catch the cards.
0761169431|5.0|I got this for a grandson, who is into all things Star Wars, and tried his hand at Origami and was fascinated with it. So, Merry Christmas to D.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|From the very beginning the author wisks you away into a world so different and yet so human exploring all the good and bad that humans as a race have to offer. This book was truly a pleasure to read and I am sure it is destined to become a classic, it kept you wondering what the next page would bring until the very end. I read the last half of the book in one night and was sorry when the journey ended. Great job keep up the good work and thanks for sharing with all of us the microcosm of the silos.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This Sophomore album's been on repeat for the last few hours.  Can't get enough of Mr. Hernandez!  Such talent!!!  My absolute fave track is Gorilla.  Hooooooly Mother, what an amazing song!!!  Can't wait to see you in concert again...and it better be back home in Hawaii!
B000002LND|3.0|i got this gift for my wife for christmas she enjoys listening to it. i couldn't be more happier with my purchase.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This is a fun game and fact that it was free is even better.<br />I wish there were better directions because it sure is taking me long to move to the next levels!
B008B8DWDU|5.0|I love how chris just brings the characters to life and his sense of humor and his perspective on fairy tales great first novel will buy any if they are as great as this
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This was a good movie. Lots of action and a good story to boot. Would recommend for a good watch.
1612680011|4.0|I buy this book as gifts for the kids of my poor relatives. There's little hope for them becoming wealthy because they are democrats, but their kids still have time to become successful. A lot of things in the book do not fit the world view of their parents and it's obvious that their parents are financially illiterate. All the kids need are better ideas for the future.
B007XC9BSK|2.0|The picture suggests that the case brings a cart, but do not bring none.<br />I did not read the customer feedback, this would have helped.<br />Even wheel, it's just a simple case.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|fun for everyone adults to kids will enjoy.  great graphics very interactive. my 5year old loves it.  the ponies are the ones from the cartoon and toys from walmart.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I thought this was a terrific movie. The cast was fabulous and movie was very enjoyable. I also like movies with a happy ending.<br />Will watch it again during the holidays.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|this is a story, which leaves you wondering. wondering about life, sufforing, the power and weaknesses of the mind. it is full of precious, little, psychological insights, especially chapter 56 on fear. only 3 pages, but one of the wisest and strongest descriptions of a feeling we all know.<br /><br />it is beutyful and ugly, inspiring and scary, one which left me thinking for days after finishing.<br /><br />the language is advanced for non-english reader, not proficient in biology and animal names, but still, even though english is not my first language, i was mostly taken abash by the depth of the insights.
0521673763|5.0|This book is a must have for any psychopharmacology class. It is very detailed and lays out some theories as to the best treatment available.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing yahtzee but unfortunately for me most of my friends are too busy these days or just don't share in the joy. This app has filled that void.<br />Now I can play whenever I feel the urge.<br /><br />I downloaded it when it was offered as the 'free app of the day' by Amazon &amp; have been playing ever since with random people online. Although it can get a little annoying when you're in the mood to play &amp; you have to wait several hours for your opponent to take their turn but that is to be expected when you're playing random people. You have to keep in mind, they may be in different time zones or even different countries, not to mention that sometimes things just come up.<br /><br />Overall I think it's an enjoyable game. However, after reading some of the other reviews concerning the permissions required by this app I am somewhat concerned. I do not have enough understanding of exactly what these &quot;permissions&quot; allow &amp; that is why I only gave it 4 stars. Once I look into this, I may change my rating.
B000SZK41M|5.0|If you haven't seen Die Hard, or if you haven't seen it for a long time, treat yourself.  This is a really good, fun movie.
034580404X|5.0|Its a christmas gift for my mom but what i can tell it was good. Thanks for being an awesome sight.
B0091V6TJ0|5.0|Can was so ahead of their time. Forward thinking music, and very creative. I love all the atmosphere's they create and improvise with. Future days album is another masterpiece!!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|my almost teen daughter loves taylor swift and actually I kind of like her music as well (rather than the rest of the main streem music out there that some junior high kids are listening too).  My daughter specifically requested this CD for the holiday season so I am looking forward to giving it to her.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I read and write a lot. It's great to be able to keep separate notebooks for a variety of topics. I also love the customization and the ability to play with the colors, covers, and such. And of course, the password protection is a plus...I don't have to worry about things getting erased or altered by little hands playing toddler games on my Kindle!
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|It's a fun cute film. Well executed artistically and funny!!<br />Talented cast, good script,<br /><br />Great for my 10 year old and me!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|He has been my favorite author for years including William Shakespeare . I read a different version of Christmas Carol 2 years ago but this one is more elaborate and truly does cover the original classic instead of rewrites  ( which was the kind I read before I saw this in the App store. ) When I was little I saw the movies and the first ghost was always a woman, it also was in the rewrite version I Read but through this book I realized it was a ........... well you just have to see! IT captured my heart and will catch your too through peace and goodwill to all!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|only if you can make a app that let's you down load mods for minecraft pocket edition like the planes mod the portal mod the mo cretatures mod and much more
B007MG360G|5.0|really good game it is a little short but fun would like to see more added to it but for the price is all right
B001R6K4WU|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it was perfect! It arrived very quickly and was exactly like it was described!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not one of Demille's best books. Just okay. A little boring to be honest. But I still love Nelson Demille.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|While I dont have a Player for the movie I still bought it this way. I will get one next year. I am excited to see just what the buzz is about  blue ray movies. I love having prime. Nothing like getting things in 2 days. One other thing, the price. The price was a steal  at pre order and I still got a discount cause it went cheaper when released. Wal-MArt still wants 25 bucks for this very movie.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an outstandingly written series! The writers cadence is pleasant and his description of the characters leaves you with the feeling that you know these people on a personal level. I look forward to the story to continue. Thank you.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I chose a 5 star as I love this cd. This one is the newest in his music. I have the American Idol album and was surprised and pleased to see new songs in this cd.<br />I have followed this singer on American Idol and am pleased to have this album.
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book - comforting and reassuring testimony to life after death.  Recommend it for those who have recently lost loved ones, or simply need reassurance for their own eventual death.
B004GYY714|5.0|Just like the product info States.  It works great on my kindle.  I did not need the record function so the free APP was just fine.  I would recommend this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I like it a lot very kinky lol but a more discussion of how the toys were used were needed. I wanted to meet christian to see how he look in person anastasia too
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was wishing it were longer.  I wanted to keep reading about the characters.<br />I hope James writes more books.
B00991TCOG|5.0|the she inter-mingled classic sounds with electronic tones is amazing to say the least!! One of her songs was in a skydiving video i was watching and that brought me to her other works and i loved them all!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|It works great.  I would recommend this app.  The extra money was worth it for the record function.  Good job.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Considering the amount of sub-standard work emerging out there (eg. Coben's latest and Clancy trading quality for volume) Grisham still spins a good yarn for all of us who like to see the underdog successfully going up against the establishment. However, I can't help hoping for Grisham using his very considerable skills to deliver more 'real' novels along the lines of The Painted House' and 'Playing for Pizza' as well.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|James really builds her characters.  You feel like you know them.  And you like them alot.  I hope she keeps writing books.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|There is nothing bad to be said about Spartacus. The original actor will be missed, but Liam is doing a great job. Great writing, great acting, plenty of intrigue, death, sex, and scandal.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|While I was reading the book and enjoying it, I was depressed to think that diminutive Tom Cruise would play Reacher. This book was all about how Reacher looks, thinks and acts. I couldn't get past it.
B006T3RM08|1.0|Like many others have experienced this product permanently actuates the magic trackpad making it unusable while inserted in the clique.  The solution is to machine (or grind) a slight relief in the clique where the actuation buttons reside on the bottom of the magic trackpad.  I should not have to (and I refuse to) fix a bad design on a new product.<br /><br />Skip the clique and choose another product.  It will save you the time and effort of returning it...<br /><br />PS.  The unit I received had clearly been returned.  I do not appreciate getting a faulty product that someone else returned!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is not as interesting as the first two.  It skips forward so much and seems like a summary of their life over several years.  I missed the delightful details of the day to day life in the other two books.  But I was glad I read the third book.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This is the kind of series that defines what it means to be a complete badass. The story is not a well developed as Blood and Sand, but it makes up for it by filling in the blanks about characters like Batiatus, Gannicus, and Crixus. The best &#34;Filler&#34; of any show ever.
B007V508CC|3.0|Explicit lyrics actually hurt this band. Totally unecessary. What the heck was Adam and group thinking? Next time drop the cursing!
B0091XIZO0|5.0|Brilliant playing, lovely interpretations of Chopin's works, and accurate sound make this an outstanding disc to add to anyone's collection.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|order was received within 1 week excellent service I would definitely use this vendor again and recomend it to other purchasers
B005NJFSZK|5.0|Another gift for young nephew who loves these cars.  He is six years old and has been playing with them since 3yo.
B00979CS50|5.0|Probabthe best work from Neil and Crazy Horse since, &#34;everybody Knows This Is Nowwhere.&#34; Neil  has a lot of recordings that are forgettable but this is a muist have.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The sound, filming and performance are brilliant. It's not just a reunion- it's actually Led Zeppelin's Sound- well rehearsed and properly equipped live. They bring their A game for a one off performance on film. Crank It Up.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|My wife and I have Samsung Galaxy tab SPH-P 100 and each time we leave a comment to a posting it scrolls to some random spot so you cant see where you are typing. WTH! !!!!!!! PLEASE FIX!!! Makes it extremely hard to leave a comment
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A Ken Folllett book is always a 4 or 5 star book for me.  I enjoyed  Winter of the World immensely.  Thank you.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case was very cost-effective and I absolutely love it. It is a strong rubber case that fits very snugly over my iPhone. The only drawback is that the case will start turning a faint yellow color over time as it gets dirty but you can always take the case off and wipe it clean!
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|IF you like Quentin Tarantino films then you'll love Kill Bill Volume 1.  It has all the elements of a Tarantino movie: strong characters played by a spendid  cast (especially Uma), a simple premise (revenge in this case) presented in a convoluted storyline, and of course lots of violence and bloodshed.  The film also features the best movie fight scene of the year it was released.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought this book because the movie trailer intrigued me. This was a great book. I was definitely swooning, but also &#34;flipping pages&#34; as my heart rate quickened because of the suspense. The love story is not neat and pretty, and the main character has &#34;baggage&#34; and skeletons in her closet. I really enjoyed this book, the first book in a long time I was lost in it, and the ending was a fun twist at the end. My only wish was that the big reveal at the end had been more developed and not just thrown in at the end.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Rap would not normally be my genre of choice, but count me as a fan.  I first heard Macklemore on NPR's All Songs Considered.  When I heard he had a new album out I checked it out and found it a worthwhile purchase.  Great lyrics, good music.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|I'll have to watch this a few more times, to get the connection between clips of earlier Bourne movies and this one.  I don't get the connection.  Bourne's floating in the sea and all of a sudden in Bourne's Legacy, a guy is swimming with the salmon and fighting wolves. Climbing mountains and jumping stone to stone, looked particularly un-agile.  Running across a mountain top, jumping stone to stone, even Jason Bourne would look imcompetant.  Later as the story progresses, I became interested, and was cheering for the main charachter, what was his name?  Damsels in distress, Washington on edge having screwed up again, win at all cost for their own personnal gain.  Guy showing up at the right time, what was his name?  You had my attention again.  Then, turns out with this adaption, he's a drug addict.  Don't remember that being a Ludlum theme. Ludlum has got to be rolling over.  Beginning weak, story good, ending stupid.  Not at all up to a Ludlum story or movie.<br /><br />I doubt, I will look forward or buy future Bourne wanta be's.  I'm truly disappointed.<br />I don't need to tell you that the reason for the interest on my part, was the Bourne novels, which I read years prior to the movies.  Your movie is a clear effort to commercialize and try to milk the imagination and story as told by Ludlum.<br /><br />You have failed.  Your ending was clearly an opening to \\"AN INHERITED LEGACY\\".  Where as Ludlum, ended each with an apparent ending, and started each with a surprise, Still Alive, with a new beginning, and with some margin of continuity, with a charachter of exceptional dexterity, physical strength and training, you have brought a drug addict.  Bad choice, stupid choice. Your Bourne, isn't a Bourne at all and is just a prelude to what you think is a trilogy or more.  It's not happening your first legacy is lame. You ain't even in the ballpark. I'm sure next he'll end up in Boston, Philadelphia, Memphis, Dallas, Los Angelas, San Francisco or Fargo. Riding a bicycle.<br /><br />Hope he, what's his name? Runs into somebody that can help. Like Bourne!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|love product but was worried wouldn't get it as it sat in a sort facility for 5 days..not sure why but kept trying to track and never moved
0802473164|5.0|I am planning to get married in October. I read the book first and then I encouraged my boyfriend to read it. The look really gave us an understanding of each other much better. It felt good to love him in the way he preferred to be love in,
B003O86FMW|4.0|Collins Digs deep into the characters and writes an emotionally as well as exciting story. The cliffhanger at the rudimentary for me because book three is out.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This is one of those movies that just didn't make it so big in the box office, like the movie 2012, but it's really fun to watch for all the action.  True, it's like a \\"join the Navy\\" type of movie like Transformers was to the Air Force and GI Joe was to the Army.  Watch this for all the action only, the story line is a bit silly...and sure the dialogue is even sillier, but I still really liked the movie.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|I have always been a fan of marilyn musically but reading this book has really given me a new sense of appreciation for him. He is such an intelligent man and this book is a brilliant insight into his life. I was surprised but how involved i became while reading and found that I finished the book very quickly.<br />This book is a great extra peek into the artist for previous fans, but also an interesting read for non-music fans.
0307341550|3.0|I like dark stories and find them relaxing.  Stephen King's Full Dark, No Stars, was one of my favorite collections in the last couple of years. So I appreciated the extreme darkness of this one.  The writing is also better than most.  But as a mystery this is a feeble effort.  I knew who the killer was as soon as the character was introduced.  It was obvious.  Also all the mysteriousness of the novel depends on the reader never having heard of a psychological illness that is often referenced in mainstream films and popular murder mysteries.  If we like this sort of fiction, it's likely to be the first thing we think of to explain what would otherwise be mysterious events. So if you want suspense and surprises this is not the book for you.  But if you like a story that tells the truth about what monsters people are who profit off of the misery of other people and helpless animals, then you may find this satisfying.
B001QE1BDY|1.0|Cannot play on player...Believe it to be a foreign format and should have been advertised that way...If possible, would like credit for this item..Can also return if possible
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was amazing. Best time spent reading a book in a long time. I definitely recommend it anytime of the week!
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Anything to do with the reel steel movie makes Nicholas a happy camper. I haven't seen the movie but he watches it over and over.
B0012EM5D8|5.0|this is a funny movie. The whole family loves this. It's funny. Good storyline. Good graphics. The bees are so cute. Good for everyone. Not at all boring.
B009329Y30|4.0|It could be slow at the time, but overall good movie. Typical Nicholas Sparks story :) Sometimes that's just what you need.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I have seen all the Batman's movies. I enjoy the story behind this series. The way it builded up to mid-climax, loved the twist about who was the child that made the climb out of the prison hole.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This was a really fun game.  Great to have if you need to keep the kids busy or if ypur waiting some where.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not much of a reader and I couldn't put these books down. I'd recommend all three for all ages.
0525423656|5.0|Lived this book. Honestly after matched I was underwhelmed, but when I read crossed I was hooked. I loved the different view points. And I loved the story and transformation of the characters. I haven't read &#34;reached&#34; yet but I can't wait to get it.
1452110581|3.0|In many of the poems. Perhaps I don't &#34;get&#34; many of them. We do live with more than several felines, and we think we know them well, but many of the poems left me with a puzzled expression. Maybe because the poems are offbeat. Beautiful cat on the cover!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not lay the book down .... loved it right from the beginning to end.  Don't miss reading it.  I once met a man, visiting in Alabama, who catered the very first book signing event.  I was happy he noticed I had John Grisham's latest book under my arm, when he asked which one I was reading.  Then he explained, and I felt honored knowing the man knew John Grisham and his parents, personally.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I purchased this case for my teenage daughter to replace her previous &#34;identical&#34; Lifeproof case bought a year ago. This is NOT the same case.  The case is a more rigid plastic and does not feel &#34;non slip rubbery&#34; like the old case.  In addition the clear film on the face of the case buckles and is not tight like the old one.  Not sure why this changed.  Perhaps Lifeproof has down graded their product or somebody is selling knock offs.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have been transformed. This was the dirtiest, sexiest, most relatable book I have read in a very long time, if ever. I was reminded of things like lust. Romance. Submission. Things that as married mommies, we tend to forget. Amazing storytelling.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Game works great on my Kindle. Always a challenge to try to beat my previous time to complete the game.
B001QXCYZY|5.0|This product is really awesome even if you are not a professional singer, if you know how to configure it, you are about to become the next superstar! I hardly recommend it! :D
B003VDZK8K|5.0|I LOVE this album!!  This at the top of my favorite albums ever list!  Avenged Sevenfold kicks ass, great work guys!
1582701709|5.0|The book is made of excellent heavy bond type paper, like a resume paper or diploma/certificate paper type.  It looks like a good product for a good legacy passed on to next generation.<br /><br />It exceed my expectation
B008YWY0HK|5.0|PIXAR HAS MADE SEVERAL MOVIES AS WE ALL KNOW, BUT THIS<br />MOVIE IS INDEED EXCEPTIONAL AND MARVELOUS.  ALL AGES<br />WILL ENJOY EVERYTHING ABOUT THE MOVIE.  THE IRISH<br />IN BRAVE WAS OUTSTANDING AND THE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED<br />ARE OUTSTANDING AS WELL
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is very addictive.Howerver it really isnt free I found myself having to buy diamonds for food/energy more often then not.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  Anxious to get started on the next one.  I started from book one and am trying to catch up.
B0086700CM|1.0|This game was cool and addictive at first but now it is very choppy and lags way too much. Also when I want to jump or turn I either wont or the guy does the opposite instruction. so plz fix it. :(
B002ZG997C|5.0|HAS DENZEL EVER MADE A MOVIE THAT WASNT GREAT.<br />THIS ONE NOT ONLY HAS A STORY TO IT, BUT HIS ACTING<br />IS WONDERFUL.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate. Fast. Love it! Told all of my friends. Everyone agrees with me. Get it. You won't be disappointed. Trust me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I will forever be a fan of this game. I love the challenges, the task,  collecting my coins. I wish my life was this organized!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the BEST YET!  I have all of the Angry Birds on my Galaxy S3 and Kindle Fire and This one IS THE BEST!<br />Of course i am an avid Star Wars fan, so i am a little biased, but all the new things you can do with the lightsaber, the force power, etc  is soooo awesome!  I LOVE IT!
B0063GORYU|3.0|I PLAY IT, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY I REALLY KNOW THE GAME.<br />ITS A DIFFERENT KIND OF SOLITARE, WHICH IS NICE.  WOULD<br />RECOMMEND TO ANYONE.
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|If you have an early teen who is open minded, likes sci-fi and fantasy, and even a bit nerdy, this is a cool movie. It teaches that you should not judge by just sight or what you've seen in the movies. 'Get the full story before you act.' But it's really not for the little kids. It will scare them even though it'll lead to a happy ending. Best played at Holloween.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|This movie was really about Jason Mamoa and to see him expand his skills.  He did a good job.  The story was predictable, but lots of fun.  The only thing I would have left out was the graphic sex scene.  Why movie producers think that is necessary or even appealing, is beyond me.  If people want to watch sex, there are plenty of places for it.  In the movies, why not keep romance as a tantalizing idea rather than forcing sex upon the audience, and the actors.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie was well done, the bad guy was stomped satisfactorily, and our hero set off for another adventure.
B0063IH60K|1.0|&#34;You get what you pay for&#34;, never more true than here! Game is ok, but with limited options. I've played better. But those ADS...each time you start a new game you have to deal with another AD and I'm talking small ad, but full screen. Sometimes it allows you to &#34;skip&#34;, sometimes you have to find the tiny little &#34;x&#34; to quit, but sometimes there's simply no way out,. You have to shut it down and start over. No thanks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE.  SO MANY CHOICES AND<br />LOTS OF FUN, FUN, FUN.  BEING ABLE TO TOUCH SCREEN IS A PLUS.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|everytime I go to buy something. I get kicked out of the game and I'm unable to open new challenges for the same reason pls fix asap cause I'm addicted to playing and its making me mad
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very excited to get this trilogy on Blu-ray under $30!  Didn't expect to be getting digital copies  of all three as well! Code is for all three movies (like a package deal; no splitting between accounts). Very nice surprise to round out my purchase.  Couldn't want anything more.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Great action and ending leaves it open for JGL to take over the reigns. Hathaway was sassy and sexy. enjoyed it.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|NATURALLY THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER VERSION.  HOWEVER, THIS<br />VERSION IS A EXCEPTIONAL ONE.  I'VE WATCHED IT MORE TIMES<br />THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE, WELL WORTH IT EVERY TIME.  CROWE<br />IS OUTSTANDING IN THIS.
B004GGM444|4.0|I don't know a single thing about this genre, Skrillex, or how one makes music like this, but I love it.<br />I can't go cover to cover on this album, but I've been known to end a flight to Vegas with a few songs on loop. Loud.
B004UJST78|5.0|It's a very deph book I still didn't read it entirely but I could already notice that is a good discussion about language.

1452101248|1.0|I have been an off and on vegetarian for about fifteen years. Recently I moved our family to a 100% vegetarian diet that includes not using a lot of fat because I am concerned about the long term effects of eating a lot of foods that have saturated fats (cheese in particular, but olive oil as well, which is 14% saturated fat). If you are looking for cookbooks that might offer some help in this respect, do not buy this one. The majority of the recipes are loaded with eggs, olive and vegetable oils, cheese, butter, heavy cream and creme fraiche. We are not talking moderate quantities either--the Mushroom Lasagne has eighteen ounces of cheese, thirteen ounces of ricotta cheese, ten tablespoons of butter and one large egg. The Caramelized Garlic Tart uses one tablespoon of olive oil, but nine ounces of goat cheese, two eggs and thirteen tablespoons of creme fraiche and heavy cream.<br /><br />If Ottolenghi uses olive oil in a recipe, he introduces prodigious quantities of it. The first recipe in the book, \\"Poached baby vegetables with caper mayonnaise,\\" uses one and one third cups of oil, including one full cup in the poaching liquor. The second recipe in the book, for \\"Moroccan Carrot Salad,\\" calls for one third cup of olive oil plus more for finishing. There are a some recipes that use two to four tablespoons of olive oil, but they are in a minority.<br /><br />An annoyed reader wrote to the Guardian newspaper complaining about the amount of fat in the the Broccoli and Gorgonzola Pie and Ottolenghi characterized the complaint as \\"a condescending attempt by someone who, I suspect, doesn't like food to tell others what to eat\\". This is a childish reaction to a criticism that probably comes from someone concerned about the health implications of too much saturated fat in a diet. Ottolenghi advances the \\"general sense of over indulgence\\" over the last few decades as a reason why people include less meat in their diets, but the recipes in this cookbook are the epitomy of over indulgence. Some of them can be modified to meet a higher standard of healthful cooking, but most are not amenable to that kind of change.<br /><br />The book is beautifully photographed and has a padded cover, but potential buyers should be aware that it has a particular bent that makes the cookbook less valuable for many of us.ver indulgence.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|A very interesting read that investigates the social and cultural effects of a hypothetical zombie war while also incorporating some good old fashioned zombie scenarios.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I watched this film over and over and do the same time my kids.<br />Wholesome family fun, each and every view!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good story, great winter read! But as always would expect nothing less from Nicholas Sparks! Very excited for the movie in Feb.
B000P0J09W|5.0|The Goonies is the adventure that all of us dreamed of having as kids. A rainy Friday afternoon transforms into an almost-believable underground romp with a group of kids that you could imagine yourself hanging out with back in middle school. Imagine that, a movie with an all-child cast that's actually likeable and who actually talk/behave like children! Screenwriters & directors today can learn a lot from Chris Columbus & Richard Donner.<br /><br />The great locations/sets and dialogue between the goonies never gets old and I make it a point to rewatch this at least once a year.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Love Angry Birds however I cannot play if I do not have internet connection. WTF come on really. Why am I still needing internet connection for to run your apps. I have 4 them 2 of them need internet connection to of them do not again WTF
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I read this book to see if it would be appropriate for my 9-year old.  While I feel some of the subject matter is still a little bit mature for him, this is a beautiful story of acceptance and the ups and downs of the &#34;tween&#34; years.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|All I'm gonna say is this...<br /><br />My wife and I went to her live show in Alexandria, VA a few weeks ago. I told her that I simply wanted to hug Ms. La Havas and smell her hair.<br /><br />She said that she would probably do the same.<br /><br />If US R&B has you wanting, give your ears some TLC and check Lianne La Havas out. Actually, after you read this review, go on YouTube, and search for \\"Empty- Tour Bus Session\\".<br /><br />You're welcome.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Feed your inner Carny remember the good ole days of dropping quarters from your week's allowance.  Ah, the days when $5 actually bought something.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this video after having my twins (who are four) and wanting to get back into shape. I recently had my 5th baby and am loving this video just as much as I did before. It goes by quickly, if not painlessly and I love how it is easily modified for different levels. My husband and I work out together and we both love this video I use 3 pound weights which is enough for me and he uses fives. Level one is still kicking out butts after week 1, I love that there is still 2 more intense workouts waiting for me as I progress!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|After reading Gone Girl, I was so interested to read Gillian Flynn's other novels.  I read Dark Days next, then Sharp Objects.  This is definitely a first novel - a little rougher than the next two, but definitely worth a read.  Typical twists and turn keep you in the book and turning the pages as fast as you can.  I can wait to see what she'll do next!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|A good movie. Kept my interest. Cute aliens & ugly aliens. the story played out like normal. good guy versus bad guy, but with enough side story to keep me interested.
0307730697|5.0|It was such a powerful and inspiring book!! Amazing man, amazing wife too! I definitely think everyone should read it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The story followed along so systematicly that the characters come alive and made it seem like they were real and I was disappointed when the story ended because I wouldn't  see them again unless Michael decides to write another story. I have read every Michael Connelly novel and while some are better than others I hav never been disappointed in his work. Black Box is exceptional
B0076DELIG|4.0|But this one starts out slowly.  It builds into the kind of quality story we fans have come to expect though, with an ending you will not be able to put down.
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Although the central idea of the book is quite nice, Mr. Card puts a lot of effort on making their characters speak a foreign language - Portuguese - on a most annoying, careless and absurd way. Not being in any way important to the story, the frequent Portuguese phrases, full of spelling errors and lack of sense, are at most a poor attempt from a non-Portuguese speaker to show off to his classmates. It is a nice book ruined by the lack of editing that a junior high student in Brazil could  do!
B002ZG99IG|2.0|It's what I asked for and ordered and still need to watch the DVD to make sure that works, but there was a puncture hole in the DVD case ... Box didn't seem to be damaged though.
B006OITIQE|5.0|Love these boys. I enjoy listening to their music on the way to work in the morning. I'm glad I purchased their album.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Ads are not obtrusive and functionality is excellent. Very happy with the sound feature that dings on connect and again when full. I like it. It doesn't need to do any more.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great movie!  A classic Christmas story that will enchant young and old.  I would say, though, it is not for the very young as it has some frightening scenes that may be too intense.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This movie is already fantastic. But on bluray, it's even MORE enjoyable! Great purchase :) Good price as well... Cheers
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Very interesting characters although I have a hard time remembering who is who with many of the names being alike.
B001RMYWG8|4.0|I've seen this movie many time over the years and always enjoy Al Pacino's 'honest cop in a crooked police force' portrayal. In many ways, better than newer movies having the same plot.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|First published in 1862 Les Miserables is widely regarded as one of the finest novels of the 19th century and covers  the years 1815-1832, a turbulent period in French history. The development of the character of main protagonist Jean Valjean  from ex-convict to  redeemed wealth is riveting.  His interaction with the other players in the novel, noticeably policeman Javert, is absorbing, while the love element, both romantic and familial is touching and sensitively handled.  This is a must read for first timers and worth a revisit for those who are familiar with the plot.  It should enjoy renewed popularity  with the release of the film starring Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway
B0084IG8TM|4.0|after all the hype and hoopla over this series and movie, i was pleasantly surprised to find the story easy to follow and enjoyable. the heroine was likeable, and often just enough  unpredictable, to make the plot beleivable and  interesting. even  though she was flat and deadpan through most of the movie, Katniss has a few surprisingly human twists and saves the story from being completely predictable and boring
075669812X|4.0|Book is large and well made. My son will love to unwrap it on christmas morning. Book has a lot of characters in it. I don't know anything about the actual Ninjago stuff so I can't comment on if it has all the characters in it or not.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Another good movie in the Christian Bale Batman series. Good, complex plot, filled with great special effects. Enjoyed it a lot!
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|This movie is decent, I wouldn't know, more for the ladies. Men like movies with fart jokes and people like the American pie cast and Kumar!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|for a person who is NOT a comic book fan, this movie was engaging and at times a belly-chuckle. special effects were good and the story was not as &#34; hokey &#34; as i first thought it might be. I did enjoy it , even though is was predictable and sometimes boring.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!! LOVE THE MOVIE and was sent/received quickly and we are enjoying it!!! A+++++++ Nice to not have to fight the crowds at a store!

B001O2S7XA|5.0|This is the 1st set with a booster that we've tried.<br />It's a lot of fun!<br /><br />Makes me think of a \\"perpetuum mobile\\".<br />If only it could work without the batteries :-)<br /><br />Once you drop the car in it,....<br />it will go over-and-over-and-over-..... !<br /><br />Kids like it. Having a lot of fun with it.<br />Doesn't work with all Hot Wheel cars,<br />but they have enough for which it works.<br /><br />Great set.<br /><br />Of course, kids now are looking for other sets and tracks,<br />to connect to each other.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|The Bone Bed. Great read as usual. Wish to have more interaction between the principal characters. They are supposed to be so in love but they do not seem to trust each other in their personal relationship
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I somehow stumbled upon this book and was incredibly surprised. It was a wonderful story that kept me engrossed. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />You would do yourself a great dis-service if you dont take the time to read this novel.
B001N26GFM|1.0|I am the director of education in a Holocaust museum and I tell teachers not to use this book.  I read the book and when I was finished I didn't quite know what to do because I knew teachers would use it in their classrooms without ever reading the author's declaration that the book is a fable and I was correct.  Students believe that the books that their teacher's hand them to read are true, 100% true and this book is not only not true, it is completely improbable.  There are many fine books about the Holocaust to share with students, this is not one of them.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Had to have this series.  It's the best.  Can't wait to get Season 2.  Item arrived as ordererd and quickly.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|Sense and Sensibility. Great movie in the tradition of Pride and PRejudice. I always love ther British settings and characters
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Great game that teaches you to \\"figure it out\\" and sometimes think outside the box. I love it (44 years old, master degree) and so does my son (5 1/2 years old, advanced student). We play this for hours.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|i remember when this particular blu ray was 100.00 new! . . . now i got it used for 16.00 . . . ohhhh mmaaannn!! i mean im sure EVERYONE has seen some planet earth so you must know this is good before even buying it! there were some shots though that seemed almost TOO epic for the cameras at the time and they came out pretty fuzzy :/ but stull worth every penny on it!

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I've been using one of these for 8 months now. Although there are benefits to never having to worry about replacing batteries, those benefits are easily outweighed by how this device will not charge reliably.<br /><br />I would expect to be able to set the mouse on the charging pad and have the light turn from red to blinking green (indicating that it is charging,) but that rarely happens so easily. Instead, I have to keep taking the mouse off the charger and \\"dropping\\" it from about an 1/8th of an inch above the charger until it lands in a fashion that causes whatever is not connecting to connect. This is a raindance I do every night before bed if I hope to have a usable mouse the next day.<br /><br />On top of that, the blinking green light is supposed to turn solid green when the mouse has finished charging. This never happens. Not once in the time I have owned this have I ever seen a solid green light. I could leave it for days, and the light will never turn solid green. The most common light? Solid red. That just means nothing's charging. Second most common light? Blinking red. That means, \\"something is wrong, but don't worry about trying to figure it out; it's really just a symptom of a sub-par product. Try again later.\\"<br /><br />If and when I can get the charge to \\"stick\\" and the blinking green light to commence, I have to watch it to make sure it stays green and blinking. I failed to do this last night, and this morning I awoke to a solid red light again, as if the mouse was not sitting on the charger all night, which it was. It also has no charge.<br /><br />Stay away from Mobee products. They do not \\"just work\\" like you would expect something found at the Apple Store to do.

B009NQKPUW|3.0|Would be more appropriate. I loved the Alien collection of movies. I had an issue with the concept and especially with the design of the engineers. The movie is very enjoyable, although very dark and almost sadistic. It's much darker than Alien. It's definitely worth watching though, you might find that you love it. I'm certainly happy that viewed it and if they make another one I will definitely be watching it!<br /><br />I actually would give this 2.5 stars. It just wasn't for me, which is unfortunate since I usually enjoy this genre of movies.

B00772M1F6|4.0|My first reaction to JD McPherson, which was after hearing North Side Gal, was to think his imitation of a R&B oriented 50's Rocker such as Little Richard was so uncanny that it discredited any originality. Vocally, speaking McPherson literally is indistinguishable at many moments from a 50's R&B rocker. But his songwriting and stylistic taste is far from anything that has occurred in the past.<br /><br />I keep hearing that McPherson is a rockabilly act, or is copying past styles with great skill while adding little new. After thinking about it I not only don't think these labels fit, I think he might have the opposite problem. There is a postmodern dodging game that JD plays. He talks of his old influences (from 40's R&B to the Clash) and about simplification. But he almost seems afraid of straight forward, conventional Rock 'n' Roll, and its popular appeal. The song that seems most in touch with the simple, catchy, dancable, fun spirit of Rock 'n' Roll is North Side Gal, the opening spearhead track. Pretty much all the other tracks give off a self conscious sense of trying something new by blending old influences into a musical smoothie.<br /><br />Rockabilly is a stringent style with many unavoidable hallmarks. If too many of those hallmarks are avoided it quickly ceases to sound like rockabilly to anyone. JD McPherson is very retro sounding, perhaps to a misleading degree, but he's definitely not rockabilly. On sound and style building blocks, his number one influence for Signs and Signifiers seems to be old R&B. Though McPherson is an excellent guitarist, too little of this music is guitar driven. A lot of the riffs and solos are left up to saxophones who serve well but lack the personality of McPherson's playing.<br /><br />Though McPherson's building blocks are almost all old, and make no effort to hide in the larger structure, the larger structure is very much of our time. One could crudely call this 'Hipster music'. It is earnest and serious despite songsabout simple rock topics like snooty girls, dancing and needing rock music to function. The song structure takes simplicity cues from old songs, but McPherson often seems to be thumbing his nose at normal song structure. Just when you feel like you need a guitar solo he's sure to deny you the pleasure. Just when you think a song will have conventional architecture it turns into an abstract chant. The lyrics employ typical old R&B or Rock 'n' Roll fodder at times (slightly updated), but quickly and frequently turn towards cryptic and poetic flights. The tendency of much 'hip' (non-pop stuff perceived as new) music these days is to focus almost all energy on a hypnotic and atmospheric beat and sound at the cost of songwriting and exciting vocal or instrumental performance. Yet this new music tends to contradict itself because without paying more focus to these elements the atmosphere drains out of the music. McPherson is not immune to this tenancy. It is perhaps one of his biggest weaknesses. If you compare the amount of atmosphere in true old R&B and Rock genres from the 50's to JD's music this becomes apparent. Something is missing---discipline, theme  and variation on very specific rules and the atmosphere that creates. The old stuff has no muddying around. McPherson, on the other hand, seems to enjoy the turbid waters a bit too much. I don't hope or expect he'll sound just like old stuff. I hope he does what Rock 'n' Roll initially did---take a bunch of old things, put them in a blender and come up with something totally new. JD is probably not poised to start a music revolution, but I look forward to the next installments of his experiment.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|In my opinion, it's much better than the movie series it was based on. It closed so many holes and made a lot of sense. I won't give any spoilers for the movie but it's actually very believable, the animation and special effects are amazing and smooth, and it's definitely a movie that I watch over and over again. Highly recommended for anyone to watch. Definitely not a kids movie though unless your kid likes movies like Jurassic Park, then maybe your kid might be able to handle/enjoy this movie.
0307887448|5.0|It's 2044 and we've trashed the planet.  Polar ice caps melted, fossil fuels ran out and a great(er) depression has set in.  The \\"real\\" world is quite depressing, so most people live their lives in a virtual reality world called the OASIS.  In the OASIS you can be whomever you'd like: your avatar can look however you'd like it to and your personality can be the same or different.  You can work, shop, attend school and fall in love in the OASIS.  The inventor of the OASIS has died and in his last will and testament, he has left his vast fortune and the OASIS to anyone who can solve his puzzle within the OASIS - \\"easter eggs\\" that you can only know by knowing what his favorite things were...80s trivia<br /><br />17 year old Wade Watts wants out of his deplorable living situation and is one of the \\"gunters\\" (egg hunters) searching for the easter eggs.  He has studied movies, songs, tv shows, commercials, cereal boxes, video games and more from the late 70s and 80s.  He can recite full dialogs and can beat all the games.  This knowledge helps him solve the first puzzle and changes his life forever.<br /><br />I don't remember who recommended this to me, but thanks.  I enjoyed this book so much.  One of the first conversations where Wade is arguing with his best friend on whether or not Ladyhawke was a good movie had me in hysterics.  (And had me rushing to my best friend to read her that because we watched it so many times.) Reading all about the 80s and the things I grew up with as a kid brought on a wave of nostalgia and good feelings.  Aside from the 80s flashback, I also enjoyed the story.  The puzzles were well disguised, and while I thought the actual winning of each \\"prize\\" was a bit rushed, I still enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I recommend this for: anyone who loves VH1's I Heart The 80s, adults/teens/children of the 80s, gamers, frequent movie quoters,  and anyone who knows the answer to \\"Where's The Beef?\\".  Not that the saying is in the book, but because you know.  You were there.  You know the answer.  It's at Wendy's.<br />Posted by Sus at 2:07 PMou know.  You were there.  You know the answer.

I suppose that I could find aspects to criticize in a negative way, but I was too satisfied to do so.<br />I loaned my copies to a SciFi friend and he and his daughter watched it and said: &#34;what a wonderful entertaining SciFi experience.&#34;  They were also grateful for the rounding -off movie (Serenity) to give it completion.<br />If you want good SciFi entertainment, don't be afraid to lash out and get Firefly and Serenity.... you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Barry W Green<br />&#34;Down Under&#34;<br />Australia

0486282112|5.0|There are several good reasons for reading FRANKENSTEIN, by Mary Shelley.<br /><br />First, it's an excellent example of literature of the English Romantic period. It has the Gothic element  as exemplified by its eerie monster; the detailed appreciation of nature with its descriptions of lakes, mountains, forests, and ice floes;  and the idealization of the common man in its central characterization of the humble DeLaceys, who are at first so much admired by the monster.<br /><br />Second, it is the first example of science fiction in English literature, as science is used to create human life in the laboratory. Some may argue that the third voyage of GULLIVER'S TRAVELS is also science fiction with its flying island, thus making FRANKENSTEIN the first complete novel in this genre.<br /><br />Third, the plot of the novel is an intricate frame story that contains not one, not two, but three narratives. The outside frame consists of the epistolary technique--a series of letters exchanged between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret. Walton is exploring the North Pole region on his ship when he sights first a giant who is fleeing across the ice and then shortly afterward Victor Frankenstein in a physically diminished state. Walton rescues Frankenstein, who was pursuing the nameless, eight-foot tall creature. Frankenstein then proceeds to tell his life story in an extended flashback.<br /><br />A brilliant student, Frankenstein's reach exceeds his grasp when he makes the decision to play God. Using recycled body parts of humans and animals and his knowledge of chemistry, he creates a monster with yellow eyes and yellow, almost transparent skin, so hideous looking that Frankenstein abandons his creation as soon as the thing opens its watery eyes. The monster disappears, and Frankenstein himself is ill for a period of time. Eventually he learns of the death of his young brother, supposedly killed by his caretaker, who is subsequently tried and executed.  Frankenstein suspects otherwise and eventually confronts his ghastly creation, who confesses.<br /><br />This confession, which is the third narrative, will wring the heart of the reader, and this account is the finest part of Shelley's novel. The monster has frightening encounters with humans and so eventually hides near the cottage of the DeLacey family. He watches them, falls in love with their humble lifestyle, and does farm chores for them at night in secret. By listening to them, he learns to speak and by borrowing their books, again at night, he learns to read. Thus he becomes the educated creature confessing to Victor Frankenstein. Finally, the monster gets up the courage to reveal himself, first to the blind DeLacey grandfather, but when he is discovered by the adult children, all hell literally breaks loose.<br /><br />I cannot emphasize enough how poignant and heart-breaking this section of the novel is. After his rejection by the DeLaceys, the monster burns down their cottage and eventually murders his creator's brother. Now he asks Victor Frankenstein to have mercy on him--by creating a mate for him! It will be a new Eve for the new Adam, and Frankenstein reluctantly agrees. However, when the time comes to do the deed, he cannot bring himself to bring another monster into the world.<br /><br />What follows is a continuation of Victor's story and then Walton's--it is a tale of madness, mayhem, and murder that eventually ends in self-destruction on the ice floes of the North Pole.tein suspects otherwise and eventually confronts his ghastly creation, who confesses.<br /><br />This confession, which is the third narrative, will wring the heart of the reader, and this account is the finest part of Shelley's novel.

Not the all out hilariousness of Douglas Adams or the wry wit of Harry Harrison, but just good geeky funny.  It was like one my friends or someone I knew was stranded on Mars.

1451626657|5.0|Catch 22 is a truly great novel, and a wickedly funny, bite, pull or satirical take on the impact war has on the human condition.  It is a strike at the idiocy of bureaucracy gone mad;it is a telling commentary on the frailty of man trying to live by the  standards of decency and humanity he was brought up with, under the madness of war.<br /><br />Catch 22 is also an outstanding piece of entertainment.  The first hundred pages or so have been described by minds greater than mine as '... Hysterical farce...' and more than once I had to put the book aside in order to wipe the tears (of laughter) from the corners of my eyes.  Chapter three - subtitled &#34;HAVERMEYER&#34; is the first highlight of the book and I was in stitches several times as I read, and tried to read, and make sense of the glorious text found within.  The writing style is unique.  The book itself is easy to read.  It has a straightforward plot (was there a plot?) which  kept the pages turning but it did not take long for Heller to remind you are reading a book about war, and that war is dangerous, and people whom we love, people whom we are destined to love but never will, are bound to die fighting for the causes that we all hold dear.  And some chapters you can hold up high for the joy and merriment they bring, the next chapter is just as likely to bring you back down to earth with a jolt, as one of Yo-Yo's friends go missing, and are presumed dead, or meets a particularly gruesome death in a way that no one could have predicted.  But as each one dies, there is no way that it can be said that they died without every single shred of  their character still intact.<br /><br />Catch 22 is hysterically funny, and at times, incredibly sad.  It is a tribute to the strength and power of the human spirit, and as such is worthy of the five stars that I hereby give it.  It is a classic novel, a book for the ages.  Catch 22 is timeless.  I think I need to read it again.  Now.<br /><br />Greggles (LR)

The quality of the DVDs is great, and the story line and musical numbers are so wonderful that I would (and have) watched episodes multiple times. Keep an eye on the price and when it dips, snatch it up! It's good stuff. I will say, though, that if you're buying it for the special features, you might be disappointed. I wasn't impressed with them but YMMV (your mileage may vary). Buy them for the great episodes they are, and because Cory Monteith is a cutie. There. I said it.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon tip: Put items you know you want to buy, but are waiting for the price to drop, in your shopping cart. Then view shopping cart and click &#34;save for later.&#34; When you do this, every time you go to your shopping cart after that, you will receive a pop-up announcing any price changes on your items.

B005LAII1C|4.0|I'll leave the content review part up to the professionals; however, I thought it was amazing. I downloaded the digital copy with iTunes and the digital copy is the RATED version of the movie.

B009O07NDY|5.0|Award winning composer Howard Shore (Aviator, Crash, Mrs. Doubtfire) has composed another brilliant score if not to exceed his previous work on Peter Jackson `Lord of the Ring's' trilogy. WaterTower Music has released this is proud, majestic, full of passion and energetic score and it's called `The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.' The first of a three part trilogy of films!<br /><br />There are 32 tracks on this score with some extended and bonus cues that will literally move you. Some of the highlights on disc one include `My Dear Frodo' cue that contains a feeling of warmth, familiar and filled with the passion that implies curiosity and adventure throughout.<br />A track called `An Unexpected Journey' is a nice homage to a spirited tone and beautiful use of strings and an upbeat swell of an orchestra feeling making it very heartfelt. Listening to this score you will feel at home and very familiar with what you are listening too. I caught myself smiling a couple of times listening to these melodies and orchestrations.<br /><br />In a recent AP released press conference Howard spoke of his fondness of this project. \\"I have looked forward to returning to the imaginative world of Middle-earth for quite a while,\\" says Shore. \\"I read all of the books by Tolkien, including The Hobbit, when I was in my twenties, and his deep love of nature and all things green resonates deeply with me.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's a thrill for us to work with Howard Shore on The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey soundtrack\\" stated WaterTower Music head Jason Linn, \\"His reputation and body of work have long inspired us, and we look forward to another successful partnership as we embark on the next chapter of our journey together.\\"<br /><br />One of my very favorite tracks is called `A Very Respectable Hobbit' on disc two. It's short and sweet and has all the fun that is Bilbo Baggins. The cue called `Erebor' is majestic and full of command and percussion as only the sound of a full orchestra could do. I wish I could peak of every track on the double CD, but there is so much quality passion that it would take at least two or three reviews to so. This soundtrack is scary in parts too. Rhythmically it takes you on a roller coaster of a musical journey.<br /><br />The score emulates large amounts familiarity because of the previous trilogy but scoring for characters can be extremely hard and `The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' has it all!. This entire score was recorded at Abbey Road studios by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It also includes an original song entitled \\"Song of the Lonely Mountain,\\" written and performed by Neil Finn (Crowded House). The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the first of a trilogy of films from Oscar-winning filmmaker Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy), will be released in the U.S. on December 14, 2012. As a film score aficionado, I think this is one of Howard Shore's best to date. You can get the soundtrack now on Amazon.wish I could peak of every track on the double CD, but there is so much quality passion that it would take at least two or three reviews to so.

B009GQ57ES|4.0|After hearing Thrift Shop I thought this album would be more upbeat rap. The rest of it is pretty serious subject matter. It's well done, but nothing else stands out on it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved the pace of the story .Harry is just one of the guys. Plus Connelly is one of my favorite authors I've read everything he's ever written....
B005V2S7FW|3.0|Use this on my laptop all the time but, I don't like the functionality of it on my Kindle Fire.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|They actually filmed a lot of this movie on location at Ft. Benning; and I got to see the barracks where I lived while I was in the Army, the jump towers I used when in Airborne School, and various other locations I frequented and visited on ocassion. Not to mention the fact that I enjoyed the story as well as the way in which it was performed. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys war, military, etc. films.
B008M721MS|5.0|This is my very first purchase of a tablet, and I'm very entertained and excited to start using it.  The resolution is amazing and  i cant wait to explore it further
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I heard The Piano Guys (who are actually more than just a piano)and saw their You Tube videos about a year ago. I was so impressed, and my husband is not only a musician but an audio visual engineer so I know how much work goes into their videos and editing. \\"Without You\\" was and still is my all-time favorite but I will listen to anything they play over and over. Check them out, you won't be sorry you did.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great and the variety of games in it keeps the kids busy! I would recommend it to anyone!
B00A0SLTCU|2.0|When remaking a movie it should be better than original without changing game plan.Half was nothing like original movie &<br />hole thing bla.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|We rented this before I bought it, my Husband and I as well as all 4 of our kids just loved this movie!!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|The movie itself was good, however if you have a somewhat shotty internet connection, like I had it can take forever. But the movie itself was entirely cute.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Great just like the movie<br />I can almost picture the movie when listening to the soundtrack.<br />Track 1 is my favorite
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is full of suspense and intrigue.  I was hooked from the very beginning and absolutely could not put the book down.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Great Movie my son was so excited to see that it had finally come out on video!!!  Had to have it
160774273X|2.0|Breads didn't come out as good as expected.  You had to buy a special pot to cook the bread.  Not knowing anything about the book but good reviews I was not impressed.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|Has alot of my old favs and well recorded.<br />As to the others above this list, I have not received 2, and Neil's book is for after the Holidays and the other is a gift
146500632X|5.0|I love it! I recommend this to any One direction fan! &lt;3 If you like 1D you will absolutely LOVE this!
B006O6F932|5.0|Love the school, love the price however there are a few things I was a little disappointed with.  1st it comes with a ton of stickers and the instuctions offer no help as to where they go.  2nd when my Husband opened the box it was intact however a small piece fell out of the box, come to find out that it was an important piece to help keep it closed when folded up.  Since I have 3 girls who will be playing with this a great deal of time I don't see them really folding it up very often, but still.  Anyways still a very happy satisfied Amazon customer!!
B0061S073A|4.0|...helps to organize all my child's apps in one place and keeps my child (and me) locked in to preselected games and cannot exit out to go online and make unauthorized purchases. Absolutely love it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Family enjoyed the movie. Glad I was able to rent it through Amazon Prime, I didn't have to worry about having to return it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Go ahead and purchase this knife. You know you want to.<br /><br />And the fact is that you will love it. The KA-Bar BK-2 is a superb knife. It is well made, has a very high \\"cool factor\\" to it, and is a great value. Plus it is made here in the USA.<br /><br />Further, I actually own a Busse ASH-1 and I love that knife too. It was given to me as a present. With that appreciated it is very doubtful I would have ever paid the $$$ for an ASH-1. However, a KA-Bar BK-2 is within everyone's price range - and it is well worth every penny, and then some!<br /><br />Think of it like this: You really cannot afford to pass up such a great knife. In fact go ahead and buy two, just for the Hell of it. At least buy one.<br /><br />Synopsis: The KA-Bar Becker BK-2 is an excellent investment for any knife lover. It is affordable, is high quality; is very aesthetically pleasing, and feels super good when gripped in your hand.<br /><br />Just buy the darn thing. You know you want to.
1609611543|5.0|Great book, Dr recommended it and I can't believe how appropriate it is. Anyone who is looking at food allergies should look at this book
B005HSL626|5.0|I was a bit surprised at just how much I enjoy this game. Since it follows no story line you can easily play it when you need to kill a few minutes. And for those of us who aren't all that great at making a little character run, jump and dodge bad guys this game is a fun relief!
B00866H7SS|5.0|I read this book in one day, could not stop I love it, it´s hot and great<br />can´t wait for book number 3
B00005K3O4|5.0|you will never get tired of this classic.  friends will like it.  see it at least once in your life
B002BWP49C|1.0|ok, so i bought this the other day and it came in the mail WITHOUT THE DVD SLEEVE THAT GOES OVER THE CASE!!!! i am outraged!! it's the best part of the set! i called the author and her rep said that she has no say in the matter! NO SAY?!?! SHE'S THE FLIPPIN AUTHOR!!!! all i can say is it will be a cold day in New York the next time i purchase another Twilight DVD!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This item is just what I expected for great price.  A great gift and inexpensive gift for Christmas.  Awesome movie!!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|i love not having ads pop up all the time. especially when my kids play, they always got confused or accidently clicked on the ads and messed up the game and wigged out. this is definatly worth the money!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book! I watched part if the movie before I read the book and didn't like it but this book was awesome!! Can't wait to read the second book!!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|heartwarming, life affirming, this film is charming,funny and sad...just like life!  A great movie to share with your best friend.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very enjoyable game, my only complaint (and mostly because of my lack of experience!) is that sometimes the right combos on locks don't work the first time. I've spent a wonderful time on this and only rarely been frustrated, which to me is just challenging enough!!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|my kids love this. they are super creative and this one has so many different options. but the stickers is kind of a pain, they always appear in the same spot and you have to move them to where u want and they have a limit or delet but 3yr olds dont really know how to do that. i really like that you can email your art to anyone if you have wifi. and you can save all your art to the album.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|How rich and wonderful is every track on this CD. Mr. Mumford and Co. are in a contemporary class all by themselves. They've kept it simple and made it beautiful.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I don't like how you have to do things before you can do other things.  I like the dragons.  Recommended for ages 10 and up.
030759565X|5.0|Absolutely wonderful cookbook from 1st time author & blogger. I've followed Deb's Smitten Kitchen blog for years, & couldn't wait to buy her cookbook, & I wasn't disappointed. She makes fabulous food that is do-able for any home cook, ala Ina Garten, whom she loves as I do. This cookbook is a must have.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|The free version is nice - my son keeps trying to play the in-game add-on puzzles, which cannot be purchased for some reason. Frustrating. He enjoys it and I would like to unlock the paid-for puzzles but the game prevents it for some reason.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I love this app for my kindle fire hd .  I  allows me access to all the operating system files an  make  it very easy to save books receive  by email, locate where they are, an  read a non kindle supported data retention with a different e- reader app.  this app also allows you to access all camera functions on the nd.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|we lost both of our dogs last year....I had a hard time so I put Enzo aside for a while.the next time I tried I laughed and cried.Enzo helped me with my grief....an excellent read
B000M5NRLC|5.0|I really enjoy this product. Being able to access this moview on line is so helpful. No more scratched DVDs
B000002O4X|5.0|This music is undoubtedly the most beautiful ever composed and played.  It's so lovely, it's hautingly brilliant.  The soundtrack from Somewhere in Time may be a close second, but Out of Africa is still the best!  The only down side is that I get lost in it and pass off-ramps on the freeway!
B000FC12C8|5.0|If you don't get it read again and so on until you get it. This is by far the most relevant book on the subject.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|My brother and sister n law highly recommended this book for me to read.  She even said that once finished, she started it over just to read it again.  Now I understand why, AWESOME!  Not since Patrick Rothfuss have I enjoyed so thoroughly a book from cover to cover, never wanting to put it down.  Fortunately I got the copy before it went from 2.99 to 4.99, however, I would gladly pay even more than that.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I really enjoy this product. Being able to access this moview on line is so helpful. No more scratched DVDs
B009PQ5Y4M|5.0|Noomi Rapace's role in the original Swedish versions of The Dragon Tattoo trilogy scored her the leading female role in this film and they couldn't have picked a better heroine. This film is loosely connected to the Alien series, before all of that Alien VS. Predator nonsense. As its own Sci-fi film, this movie is an incredible watch, for it's great plot, space exploration, philosophical ideas, sometimes beautiful and at other times disturbingly realistic visual effects, and because it was directed by Ridley Scott, the same guy who brought you Alien, Blade Runner, and several other amazing films
