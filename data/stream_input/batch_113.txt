B000002UZ4|5.0|From the opening beat of &quot;West End Girls&quot; (the Pet Shop Boys´first big hit) it is clear that this collection of greatest hits would be phenomenal, and I say this as a relatively hesitant Pet Shop Boys fan. Some of their songs (&quot;Rent&quot; and its semi-inane lyrics) leave me nauseated, although I admire the fact that the brilliant Neil Tennant can pull these sorts of things off so well. However, there are moments of pure perfection on this album... unadultered pleasure, fun, and sheer musical genius. <br />It is impossible to hate the Pet Shop Boys. They are infinitely danceable, infectiously catchy, often extremely intelligent, clever, and they have a balance of snobbery and charm that makes one a fan, even when one does not wish to be. <br />Apart from the unforgettable &quot;West End Girls&quot; (which should be branded in the memories of everyone alive in the 80s), other incredible tracks include &quot;It´s a Sin&quot;, &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve This?&quot; (with the late, great Dusty Springfield), &quot;Always on my Mind&quot; (which is an extremely well-done remake), &quot;It´s Alright&quot;, &quot;So Hard&quot;, &quot;Being Boring&quot; and the stunning &quot;Jealousy&quot;. <br />I would also recommend their album Alternative for more intellectual joys (&quot;Don Juan&quot; is of particular note.)
B00000064E|3.0|I've tried Five Leaves Left several times: at the office, in the car, on my home stereo, and with headphones; frankly, I don't understand what all the hubbub is about. The album rates near the top on everyone's Top-100 list, and I had hoped that I would be enthralled by the \\"unnoticed master.\\" I have no argument with the fact that his work is melodic (The Thoughts of Mary Jane) and lush (Way of Blue, Day Is Done). I'm simply not enthusiastic concerning his voice and subject matter. Drake reminds me of Britain's answer to Bob Dylan - Donovan. His delivery is effeminate and breathy. Compared to the Zombies' Colin Blunstone, I believe Drake's voice falls short in energy, range and beauty. Lyrically, Five Leaves Left is lonely, disparate, melancholy, and generally depressing. I keep my copy handy for rainy afternoons. In small doses, I find Five Leaves Left beautifully disturbing. Perhaps a greater appreciation of Drake will  take more time.
6303160344|4.0|She is the wife of a great composer, and the music plays in her head, because she is really the composer herself.  After her husband and daughter  are killed in a traffic accident, she tries to kill herself because the  music is too beautiful and the memory of it too painful, but she can't  swallow the pills.  Then she tries to renounce the world but finds that she  still cares.  She is still of flesh.  She says she wants no belongings and  no memories, \\"No friends, no love.  Those are all traps.\\"<br />This is a  beautiful film, perhaps too precious for some, understated and overdone by  turns with artsy shots on common objects and blurred views filtered through  liquid colors, especially of course the color blue.  Sometimes the movie  was so quiet for so long I became aware of the faint whine of the  VCR.<br />Juliette Binoche, lately seen as the nurse in \\"The English Patient,\\"  dominates the screen with her affecting countenance.  The camera  continually explores and re-explores her face-an interesting, almost  androgynous face, kind and gentle, unassuming with a sweet undercurrent of  power.<br />I liked this better than the overly clever \\"White\\" that followed,  also directed by the talented Krzysztof Kieslowski.  &quot;Red&quot;  starring the incomparable Ir&egrave;ne Jacob and featuring long-time French film  favorite, Jean-Louis Trintignant, is the Kieslowski film I like best.
B00004X01U|2.0|The single &quot;Music&quot; is great -- the kind of song Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder would have done together, if they were still together.    Other than one other terrific track  -- &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; -- the rest of the album is a sonically adventurous but monotonous experience.   And worse,  the lyrics are generally pretentious and/or embarassing.  And she should not recite poetry -- ever.    Other than the aforementioned songs,  there's nothing here that matches the exhilarating fun of her recent great singles &quot;Ray of Light&quot; or &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; (which she rehashes to lesser advantage here.)   She may not have a great or even decent voice, but she usually has great producers with great pop instincts that make the records sound great.   They fail her here.   She has the best publicists on the planet, but I will be surprised if this catches on beyond the initial flurry.

6305278016|1.0|I enjoyed this Ridley Scott outing but will not recount the story here.  As a potential buyer, the message you must get is that the DVD transfer is  a total let down and allows no viewing pleasure. Paramount have messed up  with a grainy poor quality transfer with sound below par. I have an average  VHS tape copy which is superior on all counts.  The only way these guys  will learn is if we do not buy such poor quality offerings - do not buy  this the Black Rain DVD until Paramount reissue it in a grain free  remastered form with decent sound.
B00004THAY|4.0|This CD is an interesting mix between today's contemporary Rock Music (Clapton) and the Blues (King).  It demonstrates that music, what ever type, can come together into a harmonious blend of sound, tempo, and style.  I received it for my b-day a few days ago and have virtually played it over and over again in order to try to capture the full essence and quality of these two masters of music coming together.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Great script, directing, acting, cinamatography.<br />See it!
B000021Y74|5.0|This was a weird movie.  It kept me on my toes at every point of the movie.  There was a lot of action; the musical score went great with the theme of the movie.  Never did any one of us who saw the movie know what was going to happen next.  It maintained a great element of surprise.  The ending, no I am not going to give it away, carries a lot of symbolical, philosophical, and anthropological meaning as well.  What was also interesting about this movie is that it had an implicit sense of comedy.  All of us who watched it could not stop laughing.
0783229526|5.0|Hunter S. Thomspon's &quot;epitaph for the 60's&quot; as translated by directorial genius Terry Gilliam.  I doubt most of the reviewers who have  spoken unkindly of this film have any clue what Thompson or Gilliam were up  to, but the fact remains that this is one of the finest examples of a  successful translation from book to film.  People really used to live like  this, and it is an important reminder that nobody could ever get away with  this in today's maximum security world.  Gilliam captures the feel, look  and most importantly, the message Thompson conveyed in the original print  version, and he does it in an entertaining and artful way.  Merging the  natural surrealism of Vegas with Ralph Steadman's illustrations and  Thompson's vivid imagery, Gilliam succeeds magnificently in an almost  impossible task.  The DVD of the movie is one of the finest currently  available on the market.
B00004R99U|4.0|Once again Disney has released a direct to video sequel which would have worked better in theaters had more time been spent on it...now dont get me  wrong...Disney has outdone themselves with this one, it is a great sequel  to Pocahontas and I enjoyed it very much, but at 72 mins, it was WAY too  short, and the animation was not as good as it should have been. I  understand that since this is made for video there was a certain amount of  money that could have been spent, but this should have been developed as a  theatrical release because it certainly had the potential of being one, as  did the other Disney video sequels. They all have great stories but weak  and unbelievable animation that does not match those of the original...all  in all though this sequel is enjoyable and was much better than I thought  it would be...just enough comedy and action, but the animation ruins it...
B00004X01U|5.0|Just when I thought &quot;Ray of Light&quot; would be my favorite Madonna cd, she goes and releases this!  Where &quot;Ray&quot; was ethereal and introspective this is all about the groove.  There are some excellent dance tracks like the soon to be club staples &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;,&quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and the super slick pop of &quot;What It Feels Like For a Girl&quot;.  Then she surprises you with a beautiful folkesque ballad like &quot;I Deserve It&quot; and &quot;Paradise&quot; sounds like a mainstream Bjork song.  My only caveat is that it's only 45 minutes long...What up with that?!
0792841344|5.0|I don't know what it is, but this film has captivated me since I bought it on DVD.  I don't remember it being so deep when I was a kid.  I remember my  uncle (10 yrs my senior) ranting and raving about what a badass movie it  was when I was 10, but its pretty deep also.<br />I went right out and rented  the three sequels and I'm in the process of watching them now.  Phantasm 2  was decent.  I really hope Coscarelli gets the cash to get #5 made.  Its  really a shame he hasn't been able to get into the stream and pump out some  bigger budget films as I think he's a good solid director.  I have a lot  more respect for him now after watching all the extras on this dvd.<br />See  it again if its been a long time.  See it if you haven't.  Thats really all  I have to say.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I bought eminem's cd marshall mathers lp and I liked it. I like eminem's songs he is open minded and he tells things the way they are. You shouldn't take the stuff he says seriously. I think he is a very good and talented singer.<br /><br />Edited May 14, 2011: I've never looked back at reviews I made until today where I discovered this one. My daughter had a good practical joke on me because I can't stand Eminem's music. She however loves it and I'm sure 11 years later would still give 5 stars. Me, I wouldn't give 1. It's just not my style.
B000002UB3|4.0|Wow, acid did some wonders for these guys! From unbearable teenybopper songs like &quot;I wanna hold your hand&quot; and &quot;Love Me Doodoo&quot; to surreal, sublime psychedelia that poetically capsulized the whole spirit of the '60s, not just the smelly spirit grooving in Cali or Frisco or New Yark, but the whole goddamn western Hemisphere.<br />Anyway, the only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I like Telly Savalas' version of &quot;Something&quot; better than George Harrison's.  Catch that on &quot;Celebrities butcher the Beatles&quot; (available on Amazon), and be flabbergasted by TRUE talent.
0385484518|5.0|Over the course of nine months and fourteen Tuesdays Mitch Albom flew over 700 miles to meet with Morrie Schwartz to talk about the meaning of life.  Morrie, a man of extraordinary wisdom and compassion dying of Lou Gehrig's disease, shares his thoughts about what's really important-family (you can't substitute material things for love), death (once you learn how to die, you learn how to live), aging (embrace aging-as you grow you learn more), fear (learn how to detach, everything is impermanent), greed (don't trade your dreams for a bigger pay check) and forgiveness (forgive yourself and forgive others).  \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" is an inspiring and gentle guide to living more fully and awakening to what really matters.  As a hospice volunteer I am amazed how Mitch has captured what an honor it is to share in the gift of giving with the dying.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|What can I say about this CD. It's simply greay. MY favourite is track #3 with Tom Yorke ( Radiohead ). All the songs are just great. The only thing I was disappointed with was the length of the CD but I guess will have to do.
6304595247|2.0|This is the only version of Wuthering Heights that I've seen that tells the story from the point of view of the narrator Emily Bronte, looking  backward.  She is not the character (Heathcliff's servant Nelly Dean) who  told the story in the novel, but the tale is told by someone in the story's  present looking into the past and in that sense, is faithful to the novel.  I do, however think that the lead actors leave a lot to be desired.  As has  been mentioned before, Juliette Binoche, although a wonderful actress, is  far too French to play an English girl successfully. Having her play Cathy  and her daughter may have saved the production company money, but Binoche  as the younger Cathy was just not believable, and the blonde wig is a  jarring note. She also looks too mature facially and physically.  Ralph  Fiennes' charm or acting ability, or whatever, has always been lost on me.  What has always come across in all of his roles I've seen is a quality of  aloofness  or coldness that while fitting in the commandant of Schindler's  list, makes of Fiennes, to me, at least, an unconvincing romantic lead.  His interpretation does not gibe with the Heathcliff of the novel or my  imagination, and indeed makes of Heathcliff an entirely unsympathetic  character.  While Fiennes does portray convincingly the coldness of  Heathcliff's character in his latter years after the death of Cathy, he is  incapable of expressing the warmth or perhaps heat of Heathcliff's jilted  young love for Cathy that would help the viewer to understand the roots of  the hatred he has for all of Cathy's family including her daughter by Edgar  Linton.  His physical appearance is also unfaithful to the novel which  portrayed Heathcliff as &quot;dark..., black-haired&quot; and as well  &quot;taller... and twice as broad across the shoulders&quot; (as Edgar  Linton).  Fiennes is neither dark, nor physically imposing enough (I can't  even imagine him surviving Hindley's physical abuse, much less thriving on  it) to be an authentic Heathcliff, and his unrelentingly cold and evil  persona in this role keeps this viewer from seeing what attraction he might  have had for any woman, let alone the light-hearted Cathy. Indeed, he is  nothing but gloomy and hateful. Compressing the story into an hour and a  half makes the production seem hurried and a lot gets left out or glossed  over. I, too, like many an impressionable young female reader, once thought  Heathcliff a romantic ideal.  For an interesting take on how the love story  might have turned out if Heathcliff had won Cathy, read Alice Hoffman's  Here on Earth, a sort of retelling of the tale in modern dress. For a more  authentic Heathcliff and Cathy, (although a less faithful retelling), see  the 1972 remake with Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder-Marshall  as Cathy.ving on  it) to be an authentic Heathcliff, and his unrelentingly cold and evil  persona in this role keeps this viewer from seeing what attraction he might  have had for any woman, let alone the light-hearted Cathy.

B00004X01U|5.0|Upon first listen, I thought ... this album is good but it lacks the polished mystique of Ray of Light, an album that for good or bad took its listener on a serious musical journey, only occasionally veering into the pretentious.  Then I gave &quot;Music&quot; another, closer listen...and then another...and I discovered that while the new album isn't perhaps as ambitious or far-reaching as its award-winning predecessor, it's a more emotionally honest foray.<br />By now everyone has heard the album's first single.  So I won't comment on it except to say the album that follows doesn't really take the &quot;ghetto-fabulous&quot; direction one might expect.  The 2nd track &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is a brilliant pulsing excursion into electronica that recalls some of Erotica's aural eroticism mixed in with a little Ray of Light and a whole lot of spacey -- and spaced-out -- sonic effects.  The song throbs and you forgive the rather inane lyrics because you get the sense its all done in the name of fun.  This is immediately followed by &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, an okay dance track but one that doesn't break any new ground.<br />&quot;I Deserve It&quot; is next up.  A tender ballad that at times suffers from being over-produced.  I'd have liked to have heard Maddy's voice more unadorned without all the vocoders.<br />&quot;Amazing&quot; is, well, simply amazing.  It stands out as my favorite track.  Sure it sounds a little bit like &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; but its bouncier, catchier, and the chorus is one you're likely to wake up with in your head.  Her voice, which gets better and better with each album, is silky smooth and one gets the sense there's real heartbreak in the emotion.<br />&quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; uses vocoders again but here they enhance the mood of the song and give it a quiet and sadly plaintive tone.  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, reported to be the album's next single, is another good track, more acoustic and unadorned.<br />&quot;What ItFeels Like For a Girl&quot; is perhaps my second favorite song on the album.  It starts with an extract of film dialog.  The first time I heard it, I thought 'oh no, here's Madonna trying to speak with a British accent'.  Then I checked the liner notes and was relieved to find it's not her at all but the British actress Charlotte Gainsborg.  &quot;What It Feels Like...&quot; has a beautiful melody, a catchy beat, and genuinely empathetic lyrics reflecting on the difficulties of being a teenage girl. <br />This is followed by &quot;Paradise (Not For Me), a track that is also featured on Mirwais' solo album &quot;Production&quot;, one that I reviewed on Amazon not too long ago.  I love the track on the Mirwais album.  Here, I'm not so thrilled.  While the orchestrations are stunning and her voice evokes an emotionally raw weariness, much of this track just comes off as pretentious. It's not a good fit with everything on the album that precedes it.<br />&quot;Gone&quot;, the song that brings the album to a close, is a slight semi-acoustic piece that serves as more-or-less a confessional.<br />Overall, what really struck me with this album is the sadness her voice conveys when its left alone.  Even when her lyrics are upbeat and the music uptempo, there's a melancholy that comes through that here, title track aside, lingers long after the music stops.<br />While not as bold as &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, the emotion here seems less like posturing and more poignantly, effectively, real.
B000002B7O|3.0|This album is the last studio album with Ozzy featuring the great Randall &quot;randy&quot; Rhoads. After that, even gaining more success than ever, nothing was the same. THis CD is no doubt worse than &quot;BLIZZARD OF OZZ&quot;, but is still a great rock product.
B00004X01U|5.0|With the current onslaught of overly commercialized boy bands, pop divas that sound the same, and alternative music which is not really alternative, most new music does not even deserve critique.   There have been a handful who have managed to produce new sounds and achieve the feat of heightening or creating genres in the late 90s and 21st century such as Moby, Bjork, Portishead and Macy Grey (and a few others).  Enter Madonna into this list of those who innovate, originate and experiment.<br />On Music, Madonna sets forth a new chapter in her life as a musician, playing with underground techno (as she did in Ray of Light) and adding folk sounds, acoustic rock with modern rock-like tenors and R &amp; B undertones.   If Ray of Light was the introduction to Madonna's transformation as a more experimental and introspective artist, then Music is the first--and hopefully, not final-act to Madonna's soliloquy.  <br />Throughout Music, Madonna reminds us that the best music transcends the norms of the culturally- and temporally-bound: \\"Music makes the bourgeoisie meet the Rebel.\\"  Her voice invites the hardest of hardcore to join in with the most timid of pacifists to celebrate in her musical overtures. On Don't Tell Me, Madonna demonstrates her ability to capture the soul in a modern R&amp;B ballad, without sacrificing her vulnerability.  The latest in Madonna's entourage of intrigue, DJ Mirwais Ahmadzai's influence is found on such songs as Nobody's Perfect, Music and Impressive Instant, where the funky beats of French underground meet acoustic guitar and 70s funk. Notwithstanding, Madonna's presence sets the tone and tempo throughout Music.  <br />Years ago, Madonna demonstrated that she is beyond categorization and that she is ever aware of the necessity to re-define and create that which has not yet been produced.  On Music, Madonna demonstrates that she is eons beyond her peers in the pop world when it comes to talent and creativity. Madonna has once again proven herself as a musician that is worthy for not only her substance and ingenuity but also for her effect. Just when the music world seemed to reach a new low in being bane and abysmal, Madonna has offered her wake-up call to the industry.  Let's hope she continues on this quest to introduce the musically-challenged to what good music should really be.
B000002LND|5.0|Perhaps my overenthusiastic review of this album (5 stars) is related to the fact that it was the very first Madonna album I ever owned.  I never knew her during her &quot;Material&quot; Girl days, and was only really warming up to her in the 8th grade, when &quot;Vogue&quot; came out.  Knowing that I had to have that song, I went out and bought this on tape and I was instantly hooked.<br />While she's not a perfect singer and the voice sometimes comes across weak and frail, she is a marketer and promoter and even in her songs, that aspect of her personality comes shining through.  She can deliver a lyric that definitely works to her advantage, invoking feelings that were intended and some that were not.  Her vocals on &quot;Crazy For You&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot; are excellent, while her infectuous pop sounds on &quot;Into the Groove,&quot; &quot;Holiday,&quot; and &quot;Borderline&quot; get stuck in your head, wanting to hear more and more.  Graduating to a full fledged, mature performer, her vocals on &quot;Papa Don't Preach,&quot; &quot;Express Yourself,&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; are excellent.  The undervalued &quot;Rescue Me&quot; is really a nice way to end this album.<br />Madonna's Immaculate Collection is really an enjoyable treat for ANY Madonna fan, and if you don't have it, I encourage you to buy...your CD collection is empty without it!
B000002JS6|5.0|When this album came out, I have to admit AC/DC was one of last bands I would have been caught dead listening to. But hearing &quot;Back In Black&quot; for the first time changed that attitude permanently. The title track, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Hell Bells&quot;, and &quot;Have A Drink On Me&quot; still have the same power and impact on me that they did then. These great songs along with &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange's edgy but polished production have made this album stand the test of time. What more can I say, this is essential.

B00004X01U|1.0|Never have I heard such despicable, pretentious and unsucesfull CD as Madonna´s latest, &quot;Music&quot;. By mixing dance music elements with electronic, trip-hop, techno and melancholic lyrics Madonna suceeds in boring the listener to death. &quot;Music&quot; would feature  any list of worst tracks recorded in the whole year, as would the whole CD, but because of the name &quot;Madonna&quot; that will never happen, and chances are this will be a bestseller, like most of her CDs. That´s unfair, and I hope people at least realise that by listening to it. <br />Madonna has hit the bottom, and she wants to take everyone with her. I´m going to get out while I still can.

B000002UKS|5.0|ill start off by saying that the Foo Fighters are my faave band, so you may think im biased, but here me out. this album turned me from dance and pop music little over two years ago and i owe my life to Dave. the structure of the album is superb, their two most popular tracks are well spaced apart, and the songs themselves are catchy and well wrote. Hey Johnny Park has one of the greatest riffs of all time, but gets little recognition as it sits in the shadows of Monkey Wrench and Everlong. make this purchase NOW, and treasure the moment that you recieve it because believe me, you will not regret it
0440227534|5.0|Number the stars shows you what it was like for children during the Holocaust. In the book their are two ten year old girls Annemarie Johansens and Ellen Rosen. The Nazis come to take Ellen and her family away so her parents send their daughter to the Johansens. I thought the story was a very good portrayal of what 1943 Denmark was like. The book helps you understand what genocide is and how horrible this period of time was for people. I think the book is a good choice for people to read. It is not fake, it is very realistic it doesn't have your sugar coated necessarily happy ending. It throws in real life endings,  situations, and outcomes that is desperately needed in young adult books.
B000020617|4.0|okay, it may not be breathtaking, but its a foo album. if u get into the band through this album, dont delay, buy the color and the shape today. only one grumble with the album, the &quot;rocky tunes&quot; are all consecutive at the beginning with the mellow tracks literally thrown in at the end. however, this doesnt take away the feel of the album and proves that Dave and co are not a poor mans Nirvana. if you like the Foo's, make sure to add this to your cd collection asap

0345423496|3.0|After reading the negative reviews I really expected the worst, but I wanted to finish the series, so I bought this book, and I can say that it  comes nowhere near to 2001. That doesn't mean that it is that bad as most  of the reviewers describe it.<br />I too was disappointed by those  inconsistencies that bug everyone, but I accepted Clarke's explanation that  the sequels to 2001 are variations on the same theme, not necessarily  happening in the same universe.<br />Overall it's OK, and as one of the  reviewers described it: &quot;it costs less than a movie and is better than  most of what's out there on film&quot;. It really does.
0881032565|5.0|I read this book for my High School Summer Reading.  Although I was relunctant, I chose this one because it sounded better than any of the  other ones.  I am now glad that I did choose this one.<br />It starts out  boring by introducing the characters one by one.  It talks about how they  got to the island and why they were invited.  By reading this part I  thought that I would hate it.  But, it got better as they reached the  island and people started to die.<br />The book is about ten uncaught murders  who are lured onto an island by a strange man.  As their darkest secrets  about their horrible past are reavealed, they start dying one by one.  At  first they think that the deaths are accidents or even suicides.  Then they  believe that there is someone else on the island with them, but after  looking around the island, they realize that they are the only ones there.  So they begin to suspect each other.  Every one is a suspect here.<br />I  really liked this book and would recomend it to anybody who like mysteries.  It kept me guessing the whole time.
0553328255|5.0|Every Holmes fan has more than one version of the Canon, and this should be among the collection as your standard 'reading copy.' Until I discovered  this edition, my favorite reading version was the 1970s Ballantine editions  (with great introductions ranging from Joe Gores to Ellery Queen to P.G.  Wodehouse)--but sadly, that edition is out of print, and never contained  the final two Conan Doyle books anyway. This oversized paperback aptly  fills the modern role of a definitive edition.<br />As for the stories  themselves, you simply can't go wrong in rediscovering or reading Holmes  for the first time. Sure, Conan Doyle's stories sometimes lacked an  internal logic (my favorite tale, 'The Adventure of the Red-Headed  League,&quot; is riddled with plot holes). But there's a reason these have  remained as classics that have never gone out of popular fashion, over a  hundred years since publication: they're entertaining, cleverly written,  wonderfully detailed, and often edge-of-your-seat thrilling. Included are  all 57 short stories (ideal for a quite hour in your armchair, or for a  commute during which you can escape to Victorian London) and the four  longer novels (the most popular of which is &quot;The Hound of the  Baskervilles,&quot; but don't pass up the sublime and underrated &quot;The  Valley of Fear&quot;). This is the ideal book for a long vacation  (especially to London!), and, if I were stranded on a desert island, this  is the book I'd want most with me (well, after that 'How to Build an  Island-Escaping Raft from Coconuts' book).<br />If you haven't discovered  Sherlock Holmes, this is the edition of his adventures to buy. If you read  Conan Doyle long ago but haven't picked him up since, this is the edition  to buy. If you've got several other Sherlock Holmes books on your shelf but  want a single-volume complete edition, this is the edition to buy. As it's  been said, 'There's no police like Holmes.'
0881032565|5.0|I had a choice of 3 books to read for my high shcool summer reading: Dandelion Wine, Ordinary People, and And Then There Were None.  I chose And  Then There Were None because of the title and what it said on the back of  the book.      The book starts out by introducing all ten of the  characters.  This part was very boring because there was no action.  I  talks about how they got invited to the island.  Although this part may  seem boring, it gets better as they reach the island and people start to  die.      This book is about ten uncaught murders who are lured to an  Island off the Devon coast.  As the people start to reveal their secrets,  they also start to die, one by one.  At first they suspect that it was an  accident, then they suspect that there is someone else on the small island  with them, but as they search the island and find that there is nobody  else, they begin to suspect each other.  Every one is a suspect.      I  really enjoyed reading this book and would recomend it to other people.  It  kept me guessing the whole time.
0486282147|5.0|[This is a review of the Dover thrift Edition of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles'] Dover Thrift Editions have done a lot to get me to read  great literature: classic lit at an *incredibly* affordable price (at the  time I'm writing this review the book retails for a *buck fifty*...even if  it goes up, that's still one of the best book values you'll ever find!).<br />Dover's no-frills approach (generic jackets, inexpensive paper) belies  the classic range of their thrift editions, and this is one of my  favorites: Conan Doyle's best-known Sherlock Holmes adventure, genuinely  chilling and moody. If you haven't read it in a long while, you might have  forgotten how well-drawn and detailed this is. Conan Doyle's characters,  dialogue, cliffhangers (Chapter Two's end is, in my opinion, one of English  lit's best example of suspenseful cliffhangers that will have you flipping  the page), setting and the suspenseful climax have made this a mystery  classic for over a hundred years. If you're familiar only with Nigel  Bruce's humorous but bumbling portrayal of Doctor Watson, you'll enjoy the  *true* Watson of the novel...intelligent man of action, trusted by Holmes  to investigate the scene ahead of him.<br />The price makes this an excellent  gift (aw, at this price, go ahead and pick them up a few more Dover Thrift  editions, including 'Six Great Sherlock Holmes Stories') or a great book to  take on a trip (at this price, you can afford to give it away to a fellow  traveler when you've finished).
B00004X01U|3.0|Well, I bought the CD the day it came out, but I am not impressed.  It is only 44minutes 40seconds long, which is crime when most CDs today regularly reach to 60 or 70 minutes.  The other reviewers must have REALLY been listening to the music to hear the words they claim she sings, because there's no lyrics included in the package.  Though, individually, some songs do stand out as interesting, the whole album is disjointed, lacking a central theme or character.  Not that every CD has to be a cohesive statement, but, coming from someone who is so adept at making statements, this is somewhat of a mystery.  Next time, I'll wait for the reviews to come out, or I'll buy it used.
B00003CXE7|5.0|If you liked Braveheart as much as I did, you probably thought that it would never have an equal.  But guess what, Gladiator has come out, and although hard to concieve, this movie is every bit as good as Braveheart, but the battle scenes and intensity of the plot are even better.  This movie is not for people with a weak tolerance for violence, but if you bring yourself to see it, you will understand, as many others do, why this movie is the most intense film ever!
B00003CXE7|4.0|I liked this movie very much.  It embodies the days when honor and victory were pure and untainted ideals.  You may not like actio films very much,  but this film will captivate you with the action, as well as the story  line.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|This CD has a very large sound. Not at all like her albums, which have an intimate, innocent feel. Bjork herself says her songs are for headphones. These songs aren't, they're for a film. Large orchestras bring her songs to a grand scale. <br />The duet w/ Thom Yorke of Radiohead is much better than I anticipated. Bjork has a full-bodied voice, while Yorke's is quite nasal. But his part was downplayed.<br />&quot;In the musicals&quot; is outstanding, as well as the really neat beginning of &quot;Cvalda&quot;. Overall though it just doesn't have the wonderful Bjork quality. I may be attacking it too soon. Great CDs tend to confuse me first, then grow on me. (for example Jim O'Rourke's Eureka, Squarepusher's Music Is Rotted One Note, you know, really DIFFERENT stuff)<br />The concepts are neat though. The timeframe of the character, the musical/orchestral ideas are integrated well. <br />But for a breathtaking Bjork song, check out her contribution to the Being John Malkovich film. &quot;Amphibian&quot;. THAT was what I was hoping for. Maybe I'll find it on her upcoming album.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is some of Maiden's best work, and will surely rival their classics.  Thumping, pounding beats and driving, grinding guitars are intertwined perfectly with eerie haunting melodies throughout many of the pieces; &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; is an excellent example, and don't let the title of &quot;The Thin Line Between Love and Hate&quot; throw you.  With Bruce and Adrian back, we are brought back into the realm of literary reference and psychological metaphor.  If you ever thought you liked Iron Maiden, you will enjoy this.  They are back and as good as they ever were.  Up the Irons!
044022425X|5.0|I can't wait...I just can't.  It sort of makes me wish that I hadn't started the first one until the last one was written.  Drums was excellent, as I knew it had to be.  Diana Gabaldon should have started her writing career earlier!  I don't think any saga has ever caught my attention and kept it like Jamie and Claire's.  I have laughed, cried, gotten mad and stamped my feet. It's as if these characters are my family.  I still love Lynn Kurland's books, because they are funny and more lighthearted and are excellent reads when Ms. Gabaldon doesn't have a new one out! I am a forever fan and will surely read anything that Gabaldon writes from now on.
B00003CXGP|2.0|Does the main character have a split personality? Did he really do all those terrible things or did he just imagine it? The direction and  screenplay are so bad, you'll never find out by watching this movie.
0440217563|5.0|I ordered this book directly from Diana Gabaldon herself and she even autographed it for me! How cool is that?  Anyway, I had already bought the 4th one, Drums of Autumn, but refused to read it until I had read Voyager.  I know that they all stand on their own, but you know, there's nothing better than starting from scratch and learning the characters' backgrounds first.  I was so ready for Voyager when it arrived that I read it in 4 days, which is probably a record for me (especially considering the size of these books!).  How anybody who reads this series of books can say that they are boring is just beyond me.  I wish someone would make a movie out of these.  I wonder who would play Jamie and Claire?
B000002UW1|5.0|I rank this album as the best album I have ever listened to.  The only possible flaw is leaving out the horns on &quot;Finest Worksong.&quot;  It has two of R.E.M.'s biggest hits; &quot;The One I Love&quot; and &quot;It's the End of the World...&quot; but every track on the album is mind-blowing.  &quot;Disturbance at the Heron House&quot; has hooks that have dug into my brain and will never leave; it is my favorite song.  &quot;King of Birds&quot; is a beautiful ballad that, if listened to in the right frame of mind, can bring physical emotional response.  Strange rocks, (and is awesome live) as does Lightnin' Hopkins.  Exhuming McCarthy has a good kick to it.  For the casual fan, Eponymous is the album to buy.  However, if you want to own more than just the hits, buy this one first.
B00003CXE6|5.0|There was a heavy atomosphere in this movie. It made me concentrate on the movie and I was tired after seeing it.<br /> The scene of this movie is in  ancient Roma. Especially in Colosseum where many gladiator are fighting for  their own freedom. <br /> I enjoyed this movie a lot. Probably you will enjoy  too. Thank you.
B000002U82|5.0|Simply, the best album in the world of all time !
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Being a man that love cars and car chases I found this movie very good.  The nitro chase was very good and I can't wait to hear the engines on some  serious audio equipment.  Being that I haven't viewed the DVD yet I hope  that the transfer is excellent.  Definitely recommend to car lovers.  Nicolas Cage rules.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is a simple, yet beautifully told story that is a slice of life not only because it is true but because it deals with themes and  topics that we can all relate to.  Family, conflict, forgiveness, and the  passing of time are all topics that we know about.  After watching this  movie I have a newfound respect for David Lynch.<br />Richard Farnsworth puts  on a Oscar caliber performance as he sets out on a lawnmower to visit his  ailing brother.  To some people that may sound stupid and boring but as you  begin to watch the movie as Alvin embarks on his journey across state you  begin to embark with him on this life changing experience.  For some, the  movie at times may seem to be a bit slow but this is rather unfortunate  because we are so used to action, explosions, and special effects that we  rarely watch movies that are as deep as The Straight Story.<br />Set in the  midwest, (Iowa I believe) the cinematography and scenery takes your breath  away.  Also, the soundtrack is just as beautiful.<br />In The Straight Story  Richard Farnsworth shows us that simplicity is what life is all about.  We  as Americans get way to caught up in the hustle and bustle of our lives and  careers that we forget to slow down and focus on the more simple things in  life like family, relationships, and taking back the time that has been  lost.<br />This is a movie that will move you and change your life and will  have you moved to tears in many parts.  It's too bad that this movie didn't  get the attention that it deserved when it was released in theatres because  it truly is a hidden treasure.  I have been waiting so long for this to  come out on DVD and I am so happy that I will finally be able to own this  great movie on DVD.  Experince a slice of life and get The Straight Story.
B00003CX95|5.0|You hear the pounding of the drums, the screaming of the warriors... you feel the tension as war paint is applied... you feel the surge as the clans  charge toward one another, knowing that death is imminent, and you  understand that all involved will leave the battlefield forever  changed!<br />What a movie!<br />da da da dummmmmmm!
B00004X01U|5.0|It must have been hard to come up with something that would top Ray of Light which was in my opinion one of the best albums of the nineties.  But I do think she did.  Beginning to end, song for song this CD is her best work yet.  I really loved Ray of Light but I felt toward the end there was a lot of filler on it.  The first 9 songs were the bomb but the songs after that I rarely listened to.  However, on Music there isn't a song that I skip.  And to my surprise I found Music to be my least favorite song on the album (maybe cuz I've worn out the single in my stereo).  Anyway you won't be dissapointed with this CD.  IF you want dance tracks check out my fav impressive instant (who cares if the lyrics are crazy...its got some phat beats). Also Amazing (which sounds very similar to beautiful stranger).  Also the ballads on here are among madonna's best work.  Check out Nobody's perfect, you're gone.  And I really love what they did with Don't tell me...it makes you think your cd is skipping.  And then there is what it's like to be a girl, which is prolly the most thought provoking song on the album.  All in all, it's a great album but doesn't seem to be as personal as Ray of Light.  But hey that's ok.  It's still a great album.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This movie is jam packed w/ comedy. It pulls no punches when it comes to punchlines and the visual gags are hilarious. Definetly the FUNNIEST movie  of the summer!
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Well, Bjork has done it once again.  She is one of the most innovative artists of the past decade and i assume she will continue to be for decades to come.  With this album she has brought the movie soundtrack to a whole new level!  Bjork has taken old 40 and 50's musical pieces and added her own electronic twist.  I've been waiting for something new from Bjork with great anticipation(of course her singles and remixes are usually great)  Of course this is not your typical Bjork album.  She Is her Selma character from her film Dancer in the Dark.  But any Bjork fan or movie soundtrack fan should deffinatley invest in this masterpiece of modern music.  <br />The entire cd, is of course very good, some tracks will have to grow on you but do not worry.....they will.  Then you can not get enough of them.  Some exceptional tracks are &quot;I've seen it all&quot;  &quot;Scatterheart&quot; and &quot;In the Musicals.&quot; <br /> &quot;I've seen it all&quot; sticks out because of the duet between two musical geniuses with breathe taking vocals........of course I'm talking about Bjork and Thom Yorke(for those of you who do not know who this is.....it is the  lead singer from Radiohead)!  <br />&quot;Scatterheart&quot; is a very absorbing piece........very sad and heartfelt......great lyrics.<br />&quot;In the Musicals&quot; is a very light and playful song with great sounds that intertwine with great string compositions.<br />Of course like all of Bjorks albums, this one also has great artwork on the front(and the inside sleeve has an even more amazing picture of Bjork....which i hope will eventually become a poster)<br />I could talk all day about Bjork and this album but as the song &quot;Scatterheart&quot; says.... &quot;You are gonna have to find out for yourself.&quot;
B00000IAU3|5.0|this disk is like heaven in a box. i've had this cd since the day it was released, and before that i had a nice prequel of an ep that features several tracks from 'no angel' and a bonus non-lp track. the cd has been one of my favorites from the day i bought it...it's lush and beautiful, and every track is of high quality.
B00004T37E|5.0|A great movie.  There is tons of suspense and the movie is awesome.  It's best if you watch it at night. With tons of popcorn at hand!
0780619951|2.0|Ever notice how some movies have all kinds of things going on in them and it's a good thing (&quot;this movie has it all!&quot;), but some movies have all kinds of things going on and things are a disorganized mess? Well, I'm afraid to say &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; is an example of the latter. The film starts well, moodily drawing you in, and returns to coherence in its final minutes (when the filmmakers apparently say, &quot;Hmmmm, we better try to sum this thing up and tell the audience what the Hell the moral of this story is!&quot;), but, oh, that hour and a half in the middle! For most of the movie, we get a mish-mash of scenes involving creatures attacking the humans, creatures attacking each other, muddled motivations, Brando and Kilmer going back and forth between acting fairly reasonably and totally insane, I can go on and on. In different creative hands, perhaps the humans and creatures could have come off as genuinely complex characters, with both admirable and less than admirable qualities. Instead it's all just confusing, as if the writer and director have no idea what we're supposed to think about Moreau and his weird genetic creations. I must say that the film is worth renting to see the make-up effects, one or two poignant scenes with the creatures (usually involving Brando torturing them in the name of maintaining order), and some really funny stuff involving that mini version of Moreau that follows Brando around everywhere (and was reportedly the inspiration for Mike Myers' &quot;Mini-Me&quot; character in the second &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film). But I don't know that one needs to own this particular movie, unless you're a die-hard SF fan and can get it on Ebay for five or six bucks.
B000009QPG|4.0|SEASONS ties up the loose ends from SOUTH OF HEAVEN to arguable produce Slayer's most mature, consistent, and memorable album.  Unlike the mostly one-dimensional REIGN IN BLOOD, this album has a good variance in tempos and song-lengths.  &quot;War Ensemble&quot; and &quot;Born of Fire&quot; are as speedy and heavy as the Slayer classics of old, but it's the use of melody and slower tempos the makes SEASONS such a well-rounded album.  &quot;Dead Skin Mask&quot; and the awesome title track reveal this new direction (if I can call it that) in fine fashion.  <br />As always, Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman do a great job with the guitar work, and the drumming of Dave Lombardo is... well, not much more needs to be said about his skills behind the kit.  I would say this is Slayer's best song-for-song.  The previous four albums always had a song that seemed out of place or weak when compared to the rest (i.e. &quot;Necrophobic&quot;, &quot;Read Between the Lines&quot;).  That isn't the case here; each song is solid from start to finish.  <br />If you're a fan of Slayer or other heavy bands and don't own SEASONS, check it out.  It's hard to go wrong if this is your style.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has done it again...!  Her new album is absolutely her most incredible to date, and with such an amazing back catalogue, that is quite an achievement.  Music should evoke emotions, and 'Music' does just that.  Instruments have been used to assist the lyrical content and the mood.  Just listen to 'Impressive Instant', a song about the first time you see that someone special - towards the end the music builds into a crescendo of sounds gone wild and frenetic and just knocking home that excitement!  And then there is 'Nobody's Perfect', an honest and melancholy track which uses a fascinating synth sound to 'effect' your mood!  (It's works almost subliminely it is so effective).  This album contains Madonna's best ever dance tracks ('Runaway Lover' and 'Amazing'), and also some of her best ever ballads ('Gone' and 'I Deserve It' are beautiful) and is her most inventive album since...no, not Ray of Light, but Erotica, which was Madonna's true and first dive into the dance sound.  You have GOT to buy this album. I dare you not to enjoy it!
B00003CXDU|4.0|I saw this just the other week at my college, in the video lounge.  When it began to play, the woman in front of me said aloud &quot;this is  horrible&quot; but followed with a laugh.  I think I understood her.  It's  just a kinda stupid-like comedy that's actually a good movie.  I think it's  more to amuse than be a great storyline though.  My favorite line, Guy -  &quot;Oooh, that's not right!&quot;
0792151712|4.0|No one, including myself, knew that this would become the highest grossing film of all time. But the film lost something in the transfer from theater  to VHS. If the film was slow at all, the video captures that real well. The  first hour-and-fifty-minutes of the film fell like twice that length of  time. The last hour-and-a-half are very exciting. Another backlash of the  film is the Kate Winslet's nude scene. How the film got the PG-13 rating  with THAT scene was beyond me. Other than this, the VHS is a truly exciting  piece of mainstream entertainment. Those of you who like romance,  excitement, special effects, and, of course, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate  Winslet, will surely love this film. It will make you laugh, cry, and cheer  for the good guy. James Cameron's masterpiece. Grade: A-
B0000027I6|5.0|This is the best work Roger Waters did in his solo career. From the introduction to the final song it captures your attention with detail and emotion that no Pink Floyd ablum was able to deliver after \\"The Final Cut\\". The guitar work and vocals are excellent. If you think \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Final Cut\\" were the two favorite Pink Floyd albums, this is a must have.
B00004X01U|3.0|I had realy looked forward to this album, with &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; I had become a Madonna fan, voice and harmony had never been better paired.  But &quot;Music&quot; Is a definete step down from her previous, stronger, more whole album.  Where In &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; the electronic beeps and squeals were so complimenting to her voice, Music heavily overuses electronica and overshadows her voice.  The use of a vocoder turns her Into a gargling robot (this Is especially blatant In &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;)  &quot;Music&quot; opens the album and Is Itself a great song, that's the problem, Madonna usually knows better than to start with the best, rather than (the much more rewarding) build up to It.  <br />  With &quot;Amazing&quot; you are almost Isntantly reminded of &quot;Beautiful Stranger.  It Is one of &quot;Musics&quot; best efforts, fast paced and catchy.  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; Is definetely worthy of being a single, and at last you realise what's with the cowboy hat, this Is stringed with the elements of a modern folk song.  &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; Is at first Intrigueing, but soon It becomes so drab and dull, you'll want to skip It.  &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; would be great at a party ar a dance, but lacks a strong melody.  &quot;I deserve It&quot; addresses her love for Guy Ritchie, and Is the most soulful track on the record, about the only one you can really listen to again and again.  &quot;Paradise (Not for me)&quot;  with It's whispery vocals tries to sound artful but once again lacks any real tune to It and soon becomes Irritating.<br />  All In all this makes for a pretty disjointed album.  In a line from &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;; &quot;Nobody's Perfect/I'm doing my best/What did you expect&quot;  Madonna's best has certainly been better than this.  It Is possible to experiment too much, with previous songs like &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Power Of Goodbye&quot;, Madonna had already mastered electronica, with &quot;Music&quot; she has pushed It too far.  &quot;Music&quot; Is perhaps a title more suited to &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, which will for now, remain her greatest record.
B000005IS1|5.0|This is probably the greatest live LP ever (along with &quot;Bootleg&quot; by Rez Band). However, according to a 1995 article in Discoveries, there are four songs from these shows that are still unreleased: &quot;looking at you&quot;, &quot;black to comm&quot; (I'd love to hear a clean version of that one!), &quot;I put a spell on you&quot; and &quot;I believe to my soul&quot;. I think Elektra should be convinced to release a &quot;special&quot; version of &quot;Jams&quot; with those additional tracks (which are still in their vaults). The only Elektra E-mail I could find is webmaster@elektra.com but, after 31 years, these recordings should be heard!
B00004X01U|3.0|In 1994, when Madonna released Bedtime Stories, I thought at that point she couldn't top herself.  She proved me wrong with Ray of Light in 1998.  Two and a half years later comes Music, which is somewhat of a continuation of the electronic music landscape that she introduced to her music with Ray of Light. The overall difference in this album and its predecessor is that it contains a few more throwaways, something nowhere to be found on Ray of Light (or Bedtime Stories, for that matter).  Not to say that this album is bad-it is far and away one of the better pop albums released in the year of the teenybopper.  The title track is a contagious funk-jam, while Impressive Instant and Runaway Lover are great club rides.  Amazing, though quite catchy ,is a little too reminiscient of Beautiful Stranger (not a bad thing, just not an original thing).  What It Feels Like For A Girl is a true gem, and if there's justice in the world it will be another no.1 record.  Overall, a very good album, just not her best.
6305971293|4.0|Michael Myers (Don Shanks) returns a year later after being shot to pieces in a cemetary and buried in a mine shaft to pursie his niece (Danielle  Harris. This installment into the Halloween series was panned by quite a  lot of critics and recieved quite a bit of abuse from a number of Halloween  fans. This movie is not as bad as it has been credited. It still has plenty  of scares, thrills and action for any horror fan. This DVD edition was a  great tribute to the all the fans of the Halloween series. The edition that  I have looked at is the limited edition. This means that it comes in a tin  case and contains a 48 page booklet whcih contains some really good and  rather interesting photos. The DVD itself is presented well. Although the  movie was originally going to be THX Mastered, the picture quality is still  very clean, not showing any signs grain or wear and tear, and the audio is  a very well presented 5.1 Dolby track which really adds a loud slicing  sound to the pumkin cutting in the opening credits. The extras are a very  short introduction by Danielle Harris and Elle Cornell, a very interesting  documentary with interviews with Director Dominique Othenin-Girard,  Director of Photography Robert Draper, Don Shanks, Danielle Harris, Elle  Cornell and Executive Producer Moustapha Akkad. It also contains a trailer  which looks more like a TV Spot than a theatrical.  It would have been good  to see a commentary track by Dominique Othenin-Girard, Robert Draper, Elle  Cornell and Danielle Harris. But overall its a very pleasing treatment of a  very under-rated horror film.

0440234743|3.0|Grisham strecthes his writing muscles by leaving behind his familiar Southern courtroom and takes the reader on a trip to Brazil. An eccentric billionaire looking to die, a burnt-out litigator just out of rehab and a woman who left the modern world to work in Brazil are all brought together by the secret of the Testament. Promising start leads to entertaining content, which turns down a dead-end street. I think the conclusion of this book (or lack thereof) could have been better thought out.
B00004X01U|5.0|When I first heard that Madonna was releasing a new album, I thought it was just gonna be a spirtual album full of ballads. Boy was I wrong! This album is pure genius. Sure, lyrically it's not Madonna at her best but the great sounds and Music do more than overcompinsate for it So here is my track by track review:<br />Music-Everybody knows this one. It's great isn't it? Easily one of the best on the album.5/5<br />Impressive Instant-A very experimental track. Pure Mirwais. It's clear here how happy Madonna is with her life at the moment.4/5<br />Runaway Lover-Not one of my favourite tracks on the album. It would probably do good as a single, but I hope it isn't released. 2.5/5<br />I Deserve It-A Very simple, sweet track. Another one of my favourites. 4.5/5<br />Amazing-Kind of like a re-vamped version of her 1999 hit Beautiful Stranger. A great dance track. 4/5<br />Nobody's Perfect-Probably my favourite track on the album at the moment. The lyrics are very simple, but it sends out a clear message. Nobody is perfect, she's doing her best. 5/5<br />Don't Tell Me-A very country inspired track. Co-written by Madonna's brother-in-law, it's gonna be the second single. 4/5<br />What It Feels Like For A Girl- Was going to be the second single, but Maddy changed her mind at the last minute. I still think it should have been because it's a great pop song. 5/5<br />Paradise (Not For Me)-Was released on Mirwais's album, Production, earlier this year. Madonna sings in French on this track. 5/5.<br />Gone-A great ballad. Probably the best, lyrically on this album. Also a nice change seeing as though most of the other tracks have been altered by computer. 5/5<br />American Pie*-We all know this one to. Was released on the soundtrack to The Next Best Thing earlier this year. I've got to admit, this is up with my favourite Madonna songs. 5/5<br />Cyberagga*-Like a dance version to the song Shanti, of Madonna's 1998 album Ray Of Light. Again, not one of my favourites but I still like it. 3/5<br />Overall, this is definately one of Maddy's beat albums. Her voice is exceptional all the way through and there are no tracks that I don't like on this album.    <br />*Only on the International release
B00004Y6TQ|2.0|I was excited to see a new album by Bjork in the store today. However, after buying it and listening to it some I am no longer as excited. This is not a very interesting disc. The music basically is made up of &quot;experimental&quot; type electronic sounds (which, by now, are not too experimental) and orchestration. The songs themselves do not have much in the order of melody. Bjork's voice is still here of course, but being her fifth release, is that really enough to hold anyone's attention? Adding to the annoyance, there is some guy singing with Bjork on one of the tracks. And to top it all off, the disc is 32 minutes long!!  If you are a die hard Bjork fan you'll probably want this. (Whether or not you'll like it is a different question.) If you are new to Bjork, check out ANYTHNING else by her, probably one of the first two. This thing is a waste of money.
0385484518|5.0|I was greatly moved by this book.  Morrie is truly a great man who recognized that he was not the physical body most of us perceive ourselves  to be.  In my opinion, Mr. Albom provided an enormous service in making  Morrie's lessons available to all of us.<br />I only wish someone like Mr.  Albom would have been around in the final years of one of my primary  teachers Buckminster Fuller.  Like Morrie, Bucky has an enormous  perspective which I feel is essential to our success and survival as  individuals and as a species.  The shift from competition to cooperation  from hate to love from struggle to acceptance from a \\"you or me\\" to a \\"you  and me\\" society that these \\"wise elders\\" advocate is needed now more than  ever.<br />Books like Tuesdays With Morrie help us realize that we are not  alone and our lives do make a difference.  They are a tribute to the great  humans who walk among us.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna is not so much a singer as she is a chameleon.  No artist seems to change styles quite so often, so it almost goes without saying MUSIC is different than anything else she has put out.  RAY OF LIGHT was a long techno opus, and MUSIC seems to mark a return to POP with some aspects of ELECTRONICA thrown in for good measure.  The songs are short (3-4 minutes), and there are only 10 tracks to the CD who's total playing time clocks in at 44 minutes.  MUSIC opens with the title track which is probably the most avant garde sounding song on the CD.  It's &quot;in your face bass line&quot; and whooshes and rushes stake out Madonna and her producers take on French house music.  The rest of the tracks on the album are all radically different from each other, so don't expect the consistency of RAY OF LIGHT.  William Orbit returns to help out on two tracks that sound like outtakes from Ray of Light &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and (almost a direct copy of Beautiful Stranger) &quot;Amazing&quot;.  Most of the album is dance-oriented, but the biggest surprise comes in the folk and country influences that you can find in some of the cuts.  Madonna has flirted with folk and r&amp;b before (doesn't anyone remember BEDTIME STORIES?) but this is definitely much more campy and arch.  You can hear some actual TWANGS in the mix, and it is a little jarring.  But that's part of the fun.  The whole experience boils down to this ... it's catchy, and well worth the investment.  It's not quite up there with her classic albums, and it's a little blander than RAY OF LIGHT.  But it's POP!  And I think she means to head in that direction.  Fans will be happy, and most people will like the CD as a whole.  MUSIC is great if you want to &quot;put a record on and dance with my baby&quot;!
0440211727|4.0|In this debut novel from today's most prolific author of legal thrillers, a black Viet Nam vet kills the men who raped his daughter in a small Mississippi town. Throw in an ambitious young defense lawyer, the KKK and the NAACP, and this action-packed story takes the reader on a suspense-filled journey. The topic of justified murder makes for a captivating read.
0790731231|5.0|Goodfellas is the most compelling and realistic examination of Mob life based on the equally remarkable novel Wise Guy. Continuing to shower praise on this film by me would merely be redundant but I will anyway. Scorsese's energized direction, wonderful cinematography by Michael Ballahus, top drawer performances from Robert Deniro, Ray Liotta (what happened to his career?), Lorriane Bracco, Paul Sorvino and Joe Pesci gloriously over the top in his Oscar winning role. Scorsese' brilliant juxstaposition of music with visuals has never been better. Overall a real winner and one of top films of the 1990's.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I heard about the artist from a song on Eminem's cd(Song Called Stan).  It rocks. I love her songs.  She has some good upbeat stuff... and some really great relaxing songs.  All in all and awesome cd.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This movie is uterly the most funny movie of the year. it counterless humour has resulted in my almost choking. Buy this film for it is a great  imittion of both Scream and I know what you did last summer
B00004X01U|5.0|I bought this cd as soon as I could. I had already got the &quot;Music&quot; maxi-single (which is a GREAT mix of remixes).  I have never heard Madonna sound like she does on this record. She has changed her style again...all of her cds have a different sound, and this is no exception. My favorite tracks so far are &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, and I LOVE &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;. Madonna has never used this style of acoustic/electronica along w/ her smash dance songs. I love it more every time I listen. Madonna is an AWESOME ARTIST!!!!!
B00002Z88D|5.0|I am not a Metallica fan.  However, on hearing this album in a friend's office, I had to hear more.  I've since become a convert.  <br />I believe this is the kind of album that crosses genre lines - while die-hard fans may not like it, it opens up Metallica's work to an entirely new audience.  A neophyte like me wouldn't know whether this or that riff was mangled - just that it sounds good.  <br />I recommend it based on exceptional listenability - and warn that it becomes addictive.  I haven't removed it from my car CD in months.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's new album is so awesome!! Every track is incredible! She had the terrible task of following up &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but has come out to make a record that is probably just as amazing. Madonna was, is, and always will be the first name in pop music history. Best tracks: Nobody's Perfect, Paradise (not for me), What it feels like for a girl, Gone, and well, they're all great!
6304510861|1.0|Let me first start by stating that I am huge David Lynch aficionado. I like all of his films ( I will vehemently defend Dune and Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) except for this disappointing effort. I like films that meander and are nonlinear in structure but Lost Highway is just boring and headache inducing. I recommend taking dramamine before being subjected to the sledgehammer aesthetics that Lynch throws at you on the screen. Also does the film have a point? Perhaps, but I was in so much  excruciating pain to even care about the characters or try to dechiper the plot. The other friends I watched this with were either asleep or checking their watches for when it would be over. This film is nowhere in the class of Eraserhead, Blue Velvet or Wild At Heart. At least Mr. Lynch redeemed himself with his next effort The Straight Story.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna captures an 'impressive instant' with the release of this new compilation of the latest futuristic sounding electronic club music. She collaborates with French DJ Mirwais Ahmadzai in producing most of the album's tracks. William Orbit plays a minor role this time round but his influence still lingers as there are 3 tracks in the cd to his credit in producing. My personal favorite would be &quot;I Deserve It&quot; which features Madonna's unadorned natural singing voice, kind of like unplugged, amidst electronic squiggles. It also sounds a bit like a country song to me.This cd is definitelymore club friendly than her previous &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, which was more introspective and mystical in nature. Will this album define the music of the future? Let us see.
B000002B30|5.0|I LOVE BRUCE AND THIS ALBUM SHOWS HIS REAL SIDE I TRUELLY LOVE THIS CD AND WOULD RECOMEND THIS TO ANY ONE!!! bRUCE IS THE MAN!
B000002N3J|3.0|For the average person who doesn't buy every single Madonna release out there, this collection of Madonna ballads is a treasure trove.<br />It includes great songs that were released but not included in her studio albums (I Want You (two versions), I'll Remember, This Used to Be My Playground, Crazy For You (also previously included in Immaculate Collection); two new songs: You'll See and One More Chance; some of her greatest ballad hits like Take A Bow, Live to Tell, and Rain. Also some other notable album tracks like Love Don't Live Here Anymore (newly remixed here, from the Like A Virign LP), Forbidden Love (from Bedtime Stories, and I really don't care for this one), Something to Remember (from I'm Breathless).<br />Other ballads were curiously omitted, like &quot;Promise to Try&quot; from Like A Prayer, &quot;Sooner Or Later&quot;, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; among others. <br />However, for die-hard fans, this album may be a little disappointing because we have heard it all before. In her previous hit collection, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, at least the songs were remixed so they sound different, here, the old tracks that are in this collection are really nothing new. Also it is jarring to listen to Madonna's You'll See and then switch to Crazy For You, recorded at a time when Madonna's voice was higher...giving the album a patchwork feel.<br />I also wished that more new songs would be included here. Sure, You'll See emerged as one of her best ballads, but One More Chance leaves a lot to be desired.<br />I just can't help feeling that not a lot of effort was put into this album. It came across like a quickie production made for a quick buck.
B00004TFK3|2.0|First of all, the movie is just &quot;OK&quot;.  Smith is pretty good in his role (he should have looked for another role like this instead of  trying to be James West in a horrible version of a classic TV show!), and  Jones is wonderful (as he has been in almost every role that I've seen him  in). The problem is that discs are in cheap packaging, and the supplemental  material is really dismal (especially when you see what can be done on  DVD's like the recently released T2: Ultimate Edition).  After going  through the &quot;extras&quot; on disc 2, all I could do was wonder what I  had just wasted my time on!  There was nothing of interest on disc 2 other  than wonderful menu graphics (Too bad they didn't pay as much attention to  the content as they did the menu! The graphics are really terrific). Save  your money, pick up the movie-only disc.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I've seen this movie at the box office at least 5 times. Russel Crowe delivers a stunning and exremely powefull perfomance. This movie had me on  the edge of my seat from start to finnish, all 5 times ! , be prepared for  the best film of 2000. This far exceeds any action/drama that I've seen  this year. Russel fits the role of Maximus Decimus Meridius like a surgical  glove. If you want a excellent action movie combine with a tear jerker of  note, and with the ocasional bit of dry humor, then I'd recommend buying  this DVD, NOW ! I bought it the day it came on pre-order !
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Picture this:  The best Disney, G-rated, heart-warming movie about life's regrets, remorse, and making amends is a little film that most never saw  when it entered theaters almost a year ago.....and it's directed by David  Lynch? David Lynch, who made his debut into filmaking with the disturbing  and strange &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, has always been labled as an auteur of  the strange and surreal.  He came closest to commercial success with the  Academy Award nominated &quot;Elephant Man&quot; and &quot;Blue  Velvet&quot;, but no film he's ever made has been able to tap into the  sensibilities of middle-America.  &quot;Straight Story&quot; is that movie.   Departing from the surreal images we've come to expect in a David Lynch  film, he directs this moving story about a man's journey to visit his  ailing brother in a &quot;Straight&quot; manner.  Instead of focusing the  camera on disturbing images of evil lurking within human nature, Lynch  gives us beautiful shots of the roadways of middle-America and the pastures  and fields that line these highways.  Along the way, Richard Farnsworth's  character (in an Oscar-nominated performance) meets different people who,  like him, are on a journey.  As the movie proceeds, we come to learn that  the real journey is that of Farnsworth's character which is revealed in  pieces throughout the film as he shares his life's regrets, sorrows, and  pains.  Lynch takes his time with this film, slowly unraveling the motives  of the main character.  Suffice to say it's not for the Micheal Bay crowd.   Be patient.  You will be digesting this movie long after viewing.   Enhancing this beautiful film is stunning cinematography and a wonderful  score featuring a violin solo.  Yes, a violin.  This a complete departure  for Lynch, but a film equal to his greatest works.
B00004W199|4.0|This film would feel right at home as a &quot;lost&quot; episode of Twilight Zone.  Actually, the budget was probably less than your average  Zone episode.<br />A young woman survives a car wreck off a bridge into a  river.  Later, she moves to a small town to take a job as a church organist  (despite being not terribly religious).  She's haunted by a cadaverous  looking figure that no one else can see and strangely drawn to the  abandoned amusement park outside of town.<br />This film is long on atmosphere  and not well suited for anyone with a short attention span.  There is  something, though, about an empty carnival in the middle of the Kansas  prairie that is spooky all by itself.  This movie exploits its spookiness  for maximum effect.<br />Note: this was the first and last feature film by  director Herk Harvey, who also plays the aforementioned cadaverious figure.
B00004X01U|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It definitely ranks among Madonna's best work to date.  It combines everything we loved about &quot;Ray of Light&quot; with everything we liked about her 1980's pop tunes.  <br />My favorite tracks are &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; [which reminds me of something a vampire in an Anne Rice novel would sing], &quot;Music&quot; [now Madonna has at least one #1 single in 3 different decades], &quot;Amazing&quot; [the title of this song says it all], and &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; [sure to be a dance club hit].<br />There is something for everyone here. The range of musical styles shows a lot of diversity.  Some songs are really dance-oriented, some have a social/political agenda, some almost have a delightful country twang, and others manage to be really dark and spooky (for lack of a better word).<br />Buy this album or your Madonna collection will not be complete! It is one of her best!
B00000IQC8|5.0|I have to say that this is one of the funniest and smart movies I have ever seen. Though alittle crude for some ears, it has you caring and liking some of the main characters. The actors and characters really bring this movie to life, you won't be looking at the clerks who serve you the same. Remember just because they serve you doesn't mean they like you.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is a faboulus film that i've ever seen I wont lose this chance of buying and collecting this edition
B00004XPPE|5.0|I think the two films work well side by side.  &quot;Strange&quot; offers up nuclear disaster via the failure of the &quot;human element&quot; while &quot;Fail Safe&quot; shows us what happens when the human element is taken out of the loop.
6305177473|5.0|This is very good, it's a lot like It Takes Two, the movie staring the olsen twins, the two are very simialar. This one stars Lindsay Lohan as herself, twice! the girls meet at a summer camp and decide to switch places so they can meet the mom or dad that theve never met, plus try to get them  back togeather, but the dad is about to marry a young woman who hates kids. Pretty Good.
1559408758|2.0|This movie has 4-5 very clever, very humorous scenes.  For that alone, it was worth the .. rental and I don't regret doing so.  That said, I can't help but express my disappointment in this film.  I've never seen it prior to renting the Criterion DVD, and I've gone years hearing about how wonderful and hilarious this film was.  I've seen &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot;, which was for most intents a spiritual successor to &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. With that in mind, I sat down to watch Spinal Tap.<br />As I said above, the film had a few nice moments. But for the most part, the jokes are stale and you see them coming a MILE away. Perhaps in 1982 this boat would float, but not in the year 2000. I'm not a big Monty Python fan, but I did find &quot;Waiting for Guffman&quot; INFINITELY superior to this film. Guffman is more sophisticated, more clever, and much more taut as a comedy.  Enduring a horrible 5 minute song just to harvest a few High School-calibre sex jokes is not my idea of good comedy, and This is Spinal Tap is NOT good comedy. All 3 lead actors do a competent job, the directing is nice, but the film is short on content. Too many songs, far too few backstage antics. It makes you wonder if we're actually supposed to be enjoying the music.<br />If you're dying to see a good American comedy film check out Rushmore, Happiness, Waiting for Guffman, etc.  Don't believe the hype...I did and I got burned.
079074404X|5.0|What a Soundtrack!  What a screenplay!  What fantastic voices of Walter Pidgeon, Leslie Neilsen, and Robby the Robot!Terrific acting by fit,  goodlooking actors!  And Anne Francis--a blonde beauty with a mole on her  face!--as Leslie Neilsen says in the movie when she's coming out of the  water after a swim, &quot;Holy murder!&quot;  Look out, Cindy Crawford!<br />     It's been over 30 years since I barely caught the tail end of this movie  on a black and white tv set in Philadelphia, and it's still the best movie  I've ever seen!  And it's one of only 3 movies I love to watch again and  again!<br />     Here are the basics:  the producers and creative team took  Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest,&quot; moved the story to the year 2200  A.D., created a soundtrack called &quot;electronic tonalities,&quot; cast  Walter Pidgeon--a veteran of over 100 movies-- and turned him into a mad  scientist, gave Leslie Neilsen a chance to show what a terrific, well  rounded leading man he is, made Anne Francis a fabulous scientist's  daughter, and threw in super character actors Warren Stevens, Jack Kelly  (&quot;Maverick&quot;), Richard Anderson (&quot;The Six Million Dollar  Man&quot;), and Earl Holliman (&quot;Police Woman&quot;), and invented the  most eloquent, talented, and likable robot ever to grace the screen,  and  mixed science fiction, a love story, and a murder mystery on a planet light  years away from Earth!<br />     Walter Pidgeon is Morbius, the sole survivor  of an Earth expedition years before, a philologist who is living alone on  Altair 4 with Altaira (Anne Francis), his young sexy daughter, and a robot,  Robby, who speaks &quot;187 languages and a variety of subtongues,&quot;  when Commander J.J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his crew arrive from Earth  in the C-57D, a flying saucer.<br />     The saucer lands, and Nielsen and his  crew soon learn that Pidgeon's colleagues were all murdered, as he tells  them, &quot;torn literally limb from limb by soem mysterious force that  never once showed itself.&quot;  Leslie Nielsen plays his role very much  like Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer, tough but fair, a ladies man, and  carefully adding up the clues to gradually find the killer.<br />      &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is a beautiful movie, a textbook on how a  movie should be made: have actors who look the part and who have good  voices, write a great script, and use terrific music, props, and special  effects.  And throw in the old &quot;Boy meets Girl, Boy loses Girl, Boy  gets Girl theme!&quot;<br />     (And it's obvious that Gene Roddenberry spent  a LOT of time watching this movie because &quot;Star Trek&quot; is an  obvious &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; ripoff! )<br />     &quot;Forbidden  Planet&quot; is better than &quot;Star Wars&quot; because it's more mature,  better than &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; because it deals with the  future, not the past, and better than &quot;Titanic&quot; because Leslie  Nielsen is a leading man both in Romance and in Action--you just know he's  going to find a way to win his leading lady, and not lose her forever, like  Leonardo DiCaprio did in &quot;Titanic!&quot;<br />     But the best way to  describe &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; is to quote Leslie Nielsen's final  line in the movie, &quot;It will remind us... after all...that we are not  God...&quot;<br />                                        Chari Krishnan                                          Tango2200@Hotmail.Com
B000000YBQ|5.0|The opening melodies of My Foolish Heart just melt my heart away. It is simply stunning! Then there goes Waltz For Debby tinkling in my ears...further come Some Other Time, My Romance and Porgy...how can you possibly top this album? This is simply Bill at his best, the tunes are simply stuck in my mind and if you ever listen to Evans/Bennett duet...you'll find how these tunes with lyrics just touch your sensitive heart....how my heart sings!<br />Most of Bill's ballads come from showtunes and movies...he can retrieve the forgotten material and infuse some freshness that makes you think it is THE Definite Version...the Genius with his Midas Touch!<br />One of the most memorable tunes from Bill, Waltz For Debby simply a fav. tune of his for his niece and it grows from the simple one minute solo piano (from New Jazz Conception) to a full swing version and the duet version....whatever version it is, you still can whistle to it...<br />Sweet as honey, pure as mountain drop, fresh as spring...and before I sound like a supermarket...Let us welcome... Bill Evans Trio!
0800187792|3.0|I had to watch this so many times b4 and it got kinda boring, but it was ok the 1st time, It seemed kinda long though. Its about a young girl who raises some ducklings and her journey to fly them away when they are grown.
B00003IQQA|5.0|oh i love this CD! they sound like a christian band but their not actually! that don't matter cause i'am a christian and i love this cd anyways!!<br />this cd can take you &quot;higher&quot;
0553106635|5.0|The third installment of the Song of Ice and Fire series fully lives up to the prior two books.  There is plently of violence, but none of it gratutitous.  There are more surprises here than in the earlier volumes--deaths you would never expect and intrigues which make you want to scream.  As always, the writing is first rate, the characters well-drawn and complex, and the story lines (of which there are many) flow without a wasted word.  If you have not read any of this series, begin right now!  You are in for over 2,500 thrilling pages.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Saying this movie is good would underate it, saying it is awesome would underrate too, never since 'The Matrix' or 'Star Wars Episode 1' has a  movie got me so involved with it, wanting more and more and getting what I  want out of it. I have been waiting to get this on DVD since last May and I  know I will not be disappointed. Buy this DVD, buy the soundtrack, prepare  to be amazed because 'Alien' is not Ridley Scott's best movie!
6305776326|4.0|I watched this with my mom, I thought it was halarious, but she thought it was stupid, I guess it wasn't THAT funny, but it's pretty good. I think it's a good movie for teen girls.
078322608X|4.0|12 monkeys is an original piece of sci/fi entertainment, from the title to the eerie score it freshens up the tired formula of &quot;time  travel&quot;. Terry Gillium tones down the visuals to give the audience an  exciting, thought provoking and always unpredictable experience. The acting  is good, from Bruce Willis' cro-magnumesque convict hero to Brad Pitts is  he or isn't he insane animal activist. Although most people found the story  to be confusing, I really didn't find it that hard to follow, although to  fully understand what it was saying I did have to view it a couple of  times. 12 Monkeys will most likely obtain classic film status.
B000002J1U|5.0|Well, this is the best zeppelin album for me. You get everything with this cd: rock, blues and traditionnal-folk songs. Things kicks off with the powerful classic 'Immigrant song'. What a great riff from Page and what an awsome bass part by Jones! Then comes 'Friends' which features excellent acoustic guitar melodies and strings arrangements. It's quite an unusual song. It's followed by a good driving rocker 'Celebration day'. Brilliant riffs and a fine-sounding guitar solo. Then Robert Plant shines on the C minor blues 'Since I've been loving you'.  What a great vocal performance! It also features a moody organ part played by Jones.The multi-riffing 'Out on the tiles' close the first half. Then comes the Leadbelly number 'Gallows pole'. You have it all here; acoustic &amp; electric guitars, mandolin, banjo, wonderful lyrics and vocals, pounding drums and bass. My favorite.Then, two beautiful, simple acoustic songs,  'Tangerine' and 'That's the way'. They both show talent and feel.<br />Then one of the funniest song I've ever heard 'Bron-y-aur stomp'. It's kind of an old style dancing country folk song. Watch your feet stomping and and shoulders swinging! The album closes with the gem of this album 'Hats off to Roy Harper'. It's actually an old blues song called 'Shake 'em on down', which was played by delta bluesmen like Bukka White. On the left side of the stereo, you hear Jimmy Page pounding the blues like crazy on his acoustic and on the right side, man, what an out-of-this-world vocal performance.Cool vibrato effect! 'Give my baby , a 20 dollar bill, if that don't gets her I'm sure my  shot-shot-shotgun will, yeah...' Plant really shows his power and his feel on this one. Amazing.<br />Well, on this record, Jimmy Page, John Bonham, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant deliver diversity, passion, musicianship, pure talent and , of course, fantastic memorable songs. GREAT!
0486266885|3.0|I thought this book had very little horror in it at all.  Even in the 1800s, when Robert Louis Stevenson wrote it, I still don't see how it could be horrifying to people in those days.  I thought this book did not have black and white answers to questions.  I also thought this book was way to long with 54 pages.  I think it could have been put into a 20-page book and still have the same content of a 54-page book.  I think that this was also very boring.  I mean the best part was when Dr. Lanyon wrote that Mr. Hyde came to his house, mixed up a potion, and he turned into Dr. Jekyll.  That has very little excitement to it.  When I was going to read this book I thought it was going to be very scary and that I would be on the edge of my seat.  Well neither of those things happened.  In fact I just wanted to get the book finished so I could start a more exciting book.  Those are my feelings on the book The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
B000024QML|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys made their best CD, I think they could ever produce, with this one. Each song is full of rich lyrics and great melodies. Other PSB albums had weak songs on them, but not here. My favorite has to be the cover of Go West; absolutely stimulating! &quot;Thinking of the Queen&quot; is also very meaningful now since the passing of Princess Di. I could write continuously about this CD, but I will just recommend for anyone to buy it, and start enjoying the Pet Shop Boys at their finest!
0679720200|2.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus is an interesting novel about Monsieur Meursalt, an ordinary man who goes through his mother's death, killing a man, and going to prison.  I think this novel was fast-paced and easy to read, but it was not very exciting.  I would not recommend reading The Stranger.  I did not find it exhilerating.  However, Albert Camus developed his characters very well.  Overall, this book was boring, and I do not suggest reading it.
0782008372|1.0|Since everyone already knows that Highlander is a great movie, and since the Queen sountrack is entirely a matter of taste, I  will limit my  comments to the technical quality of the DVD.<br />In short, this is the worst  DVD I've ever seen. The picture is so grainy and noisy you feel like you're  watching your local 'B' grade television channel. The compression artifacts  are terrible. A disgrace, and a total waste of money.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is one of the best films I have seen this year! The visual effects of this movie are outstanding, but nothing can compare to Star Wars  Episode I. The movie mainly talks about Russell Crowe, (I forgot his name)  who starts out having a wife and a son, and is apart of a war, which he and  his men win. After the war, the king of Rome (Joaquin Phoenix) finds out  about this &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and for some odd reason, that I forgot,  the king kills his wife and son. The Gladiator finds out that his family is  dead, and decides to go into a championship of fighting, along with other  men, to compete to be able to fight in the Coliseum. One of the fighters,  who is apart of the Gladiator's group, is Djimon Hounsou from the movie  &quot;Amistad&quot;. Once the Gladiator wins the fights, he finally arrives  in the Coliseum, and does a lot of fighting against man and beast. The king  is very jealous that the Gladiator is winning all these fights, and  finally, at the end of the movie, fights him, and ofcourse, looses, and  dies. The really awesome thing about this movie is the visual effects, the  action, and the acting; this movie is a complete work of art!
B00003CXE7|3.0|A good movie but not as good as most make it out to be.  Not even close to being an &quot;epic&quot; movie.  And whats with the blury and fast cut  fight scenes...most tv shows have better swordplay.
B000005DQR|5.0|I've been into DJ Shadow's work now for quite some time. His style is so smooth and his beats are so fresh. I saw him do an instore at Let it Be where he let the customers bring in their vinyl for him to mix. He wouldn't let anything get in the way of his phat grooves. Someone tried to mess with him by bringing in the Chipmunks and he mixed it with the Roots &quot;I shall proceed&quot; and never looked back. His show at the Quest was amazing. I can't wait for some new material from this guy.
B00004RFDW|5.0|I enjoy a well acted and well written movie, especially if it's a true story, and most especially if the story is based upon a newsworthy event.  For me, &#34;The Insider&#34; delivers on all accounts!  I found myself  completely captivated by this film from start to finish.  It combines a  compelling true story, sparkling performances by an all-star ensemble cast,  an outstanding screenplay filled with sharp, crackling dialog, a  beautifully haunting musical score, and cinematography which is darkly  brooding.  All add up to a taut and suspenseful real-life thriller.<br /><br />This is the riveting tale of how the lives of two men - Jeffrey Wigand,  the famous tobacco industry &#34;whistleblower,&#34; and Lowell Bergman,  a producer for CBS News' &#34;60 Minutes&#34; - become suddenly entwined  in the maelstrom of one of the most controversial  political and social  issues of the mid-1990s: the conspiracy by American tobacco companies to  enhance the addictive properties of cigarettes, and then cover up that  conspiracy. It is  the story of how one lone &#34;whistleblower&#34;  publicly exposed the secret actions of the tobacco industry,  and endured  his enemies' public vilification for his efforts.  It's also the story of  how one of America's greatest and most respected news organizations, when  confronted by the truth of  that &#34;whistleblower's&#34; information,  betrayed its own journalistic principles in the face of  a threatened  lawsuit by the tobacco industry.<br /><br />This film abounds with superlative  acting.  Al Pacino delivers yet again a stunning performance as Lowell  Bergman, the self-assured, still idealistic-after-all-these-years CBS News  producer.  Russell Crowe,  nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal  of Jeffrey Wigand, richly texturizes his character - in part a tormented  soul,  in part an easy to dislike cynical tough guy, and in part a dreamy  idealist.  Christopher Plummer brings a perfect blend of shirty arrogance  and pomposity to the character of Mike Wallace.  Other performances of note  include Diane Venora as Liane Wigand; Philip Baker Hall as CBS News boss  Don Hewitt; and Michael Gambon as Brown and Williamson CEO Thomas  Sandefur.<br /><br />If you enjoy an intelligent, fact-based  movie, one that is  unafraid  to confront real and controversial issues, and one  delivers a  powerful message, you will most definitely enjoy &#34;The Insider.&#34;  It is a movie that I will view and savor...over and over again!omposity to the character of Mike Wallace.

6305263248|5.0|That &quot;Ronin&quot; has a vague ending and entirely obfuscates (i) character motivation and (ii) what's inside the case is probably one of its strong suits.  The original draft of the script written by J.D. Zeik is formulaic and chock-full of hackneyed action sequences that really took away from the story.  The subsequent rewrite(s) by David Mamet paints an altogether different film, one sparse with violence that is both realistic and smart at the same time.  To say that &quot;Ronin&quot; isn't like other action films is a good thing, since being derivative is far from a compliment in most books.  The car-chase scenes, of course, stand out and are very good, but I prefer the smaller moments in the film, the ones that build the friendship between Jean Reno's character and Robert Deniro's (although I felt this could've been explored more).  If you don't own this film or haven't seen it, well... You're missing out and should be rounded up and put into a special internment camp, where you will be kept until you watch this film and like it... You anti-&quot;Ronin&quot; people disgust me.
B000000WZ4|5.0|I was a little nervous about this album because Alan had left. This album is fantastic!! Of course Fletch had nothing to do with that. They've been busy in the studio and I can't wait for the new album.
0790733897|2.0|Bullitt features a fine first half, but it just about all falls apart in the second hour.  How such a well-crafted buildup could result in such a  disappointingly dull conclusion is hard to behold but it happens  here.<br />The film is mostly well known for it's famous car chase through the  streets of San Francisco, and let me say this, it does deserve the acclaim  it gets.  The beginning is also quite riveting as it builds to a mystery  that has to be solved.  Steve Mcqueen, Robert Vaughn, and the beautiful  Jacqueline Bisset (who, at this time, has an uncanny resemblance to Liz  Hurley)-for the screen time she has-deliver good performances.<br />But the  film's flaws outweigh the good.  After the exciting car chase, the film all  of a sudden becomes so dull I had to wonder if I was watching the same  movie.  There's also the fact that aside from the actors listed above,  virtually everybody else is flat in their roles and look bored.<br />Worst of  all is the plot twist at the end, which makes some sense when you find out  what it is, but when it registers in your mind, you realize the film has  numerous plot holes that make little sense.  <br />Bullitt features some  generally tense moments in an otherwise standard issue film that wouldn't  have been much different than other cop thrillers if not for its renowned  chase.
B000001E7V|1.0|I loved his work with Massive Attack. When I heard he was going solo I was glad to hear that a new album was on it's way. I have bought a few of his solo albums in hope for good songs but have come up with none. No hooks......Just RASPWHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
B000001ESF|4.0|2112, is probably Rush's best 'concept' album, (with &quot;Caress Of Steel&quot; not to far behind) whereas &quot;A Farewell To Kings&quot;, seemed to hurried and a little unfocused, and &quot;Hemispheres&quot;, seemed a little to bloated and repetitive musically, 2112 seems totally focused, lyrically enticing, and musically perfect. &quot;2112&quot;, is 20 minutes, has seven parts, and Rush is at their heaviest in guitars. I was suprised at how the story ended. The 6th part of the epic &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, is reminiscent of Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;<br />all in all, a terrific epic, not boring at all.<br />&quot;A Passage To Bangkok&quot;, is also good<br />&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, is another favorite of mine, as the music and lyrics are dark and cryptic. This song takes me to another place.<br />&quot;Lessons&quot;, is a good mixture of pop/rock, and hard rock, and metal. great song.<br />&quot;Tears&quot;, also very melodic and soothing with touching lyrics. Love the background music.<br />&quot;Something For Nothing&quot;, a furious rocker with cold hard lyrics of reality.<br />Great album from Rush!.
B000001FI7|5.0|Can you get any more ahead of your time? I was talking about bass with my friend and he asked if I had heard this album. He threw it in and cranked it up. The speakers were begging for mercy and I had a smile on my face. I have a poster up in my studio of theirs and it seems to go over everyone's head. This band could make a killer score to a horror film.
630575067X|4.0|I really liked this movie. So when it came out on video I got it that day. I go to the store and buy it. I take it home, pop it in the VCR and then  proceed to watch. I find that my cassette has lines in the picture, fuzz,  and squiggly lines through the color. Now I have several VHS movies and  they don't have perfect picture but not bad picture. I mean George Lucas  waits a year to release the movie on tape and doesn't make it very high  quality? That was a crime. I still LOVE the movie and think that it is  deserved best special effects. I also think that I am going to buy the DVD  version when all 6 of them are out. (Yep... you heard right, George Lucas  wants to release them on American DVD once all of them are out of  theatres.) So if you want Phantom Menace, you run the risk of getting a  poor cassette version but it is a great movie nonetheless and it is  StarWars which makes it even better. Very cool!
1573301183|5.0|You gotta love a concert video where they start a song, screw it up and then just start it over, and don't edit anything out! I was only a marginal  AIC fan when my brother got me the VHS version of this as a present, but I  liked it so much that when I saw that it was out on DVD I had to get it  again. It is enjoyable enough on VHS, but both the picture and sound  quality on the DVD are way better. It's much easier to make out the lyrics  on the DVD, and the sound of all the instruments is amazingly clear. Also,  while there are not that many extras, it does have a great menu set-up that  allows you to leave the program at any point, explore the menu, and then  come right back to the same spot by clicking on the single arrow at the  bottom of the screen.<br />The video is very well edited, with some nice  fades, and all the songs sound great. No Excuses was originally an acoustic  recording anyway, but it's astounding how well the heavier songs carried  over to unplugged versions.
B00003CWPR|1.0|This is, by far, one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  Halfway through the movie, my friend had to exclaim &quot;What is happening with this movie?&quot;  I said maybe we can wait for another 15 minutes to see if Kubrick had enough heart to entertain.  Well, we were wrong.  Maybe orgies are his fantasies so he made it as a complex movie to fool anyone who is stupid enough to believe this is a form of art.<br />Tom Cruise is good.  Nicole is gorgeous but her acting .....!  To summarize my review, everything.... in this movie !
B000001TAX|5.0|Of the dozen or so reggae and Jamaican lps that I would consider absolutely indespensible, this would be one of them.<br />There are many reasons why this collection is a brilliant and no-brainer choice for your collection.<br />1). Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry's masterful use of the studio to help enhance the amazing talent that was already there. Perry's liberal use of studio technology that was at time quite radical but now all too commonplace, such as the Echoplex reverb, phasing (how I would love to have a Mutron phaser for my mixing board- audio engineers out there know what I mean), and his Soundcraft mixing board- so simple by today's standards, but boy, what he could do with what he had...jeez louise.<br />2). The Congos themselves- I am in no way implying that Perry was more important than the group, but newcomers are more likely to pay attention to a name they are more likely to recognize... The Congos had such amazing harmonies- Cedric Myton's blatent use of falsetto blends so beautifully with Roy Johnson's tenor. Add to that the backing vocalists that Perry employed to help complete these songs- Gregory Isaacs, the Heptones, Meditations- and the voices are as God's would be.<br />This collection has it all, folks. Amazing songs- listen to the exquisite &quot;Children Crying,&quot; the vocally rich &quot;Open the Gate,&quot; the praise of &quot;Fisherman&quot;, and the beautiful &quot;Solid Foundation,&quot; should tell you all you need to know. The grooves of many of Perry's Upsetters add to the overall reggae feel of the lp.<br />I could go on for hours, but I'll stop. I don't tell people to go and get lps on the spot unless there is reason to do so. You need no reasons to get this one. Just get it.
B000002UB6|5.0|However I can't believe that the August 29th reviewer actually reccomended we buy the Red &amp; Blue albums. Have some self-respect, man !
B00003CXE7|2.0|Well, the movie itself is brilliant. Cameras, scenes, shots, actors, everybody did a great job. However, it seems to me that the movie's a  little bit too brutal. In almost every shot you see somebody getting killed  or somebody dead. After an hour or so, I was really bored by this movie.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator is right up there with BladeRunner, Alien, Conquest of Paradise and Legend as Ridley Scott's best. The music combination of Lisa Gerrard  (formerly - Dead Can Dance) and Hans Zimmer follow in the tradition of  great musical scores of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream. It's a beautiful  film;  I saw it 4 times at the Theater. Can't wait too get the DVD !
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Bjork stays true to her string-infused, techno-bleep vision, yet reaches a new level of accessibility with &quot;Selmasongs.&quot;  While &quot;Scatterhead&quot; offers the album's most piercing sound, it is &quot;New World&quot; and &quot;In the Musicals&quot; that will hit the right notes with American musical buffs.  &quot;Cvalda&quot; is a raucous diversion, featuring Catherine Deneuve as Bjork's fellow punch-press operator in the biggest casting question mark of the new millenium.  It's important to realize that these songs weren't written as musical numbers, but as a Czech factory worker's vision of musical numbers.  On that level, the soundtrack is endlessly intriguing, full of sharp turns and new surprises during every listen.<br />Not having seen the film, I expect &quot;New World&quot; and &quot;I've Seen it All&quot; will be emotional high points, although early buzz indicates the real reason to see the film is Bjork's acting performance.  If anyone is going to breathe fresh air into the musical genre, it is Bjork, and I'm eager to see how Lars Von Trier incorporates this landmark of the Icelander's career into his film.
B00004W5UA|3.0|This is an unpleasant little film, with enough quirky elements to make it interesting enough to watch once (i.e., rent it), but you certainly don't need to own it.  The fight sequences are bloody, but uninspired otherwise.   Meatloaf is pretty interesting as the bodybuilder who has grown &quot;[breasts]&quot; as a result of testicular cancer.  The ultimate semi-surprise  ending is sort of interesting, but can't make it up to you for sitting  through an otherwise over-long and dreary film.  The &quot;romantic&quot;  interaction between Pitt and the female lead is simply vile.  Bottom line.   Don't buy it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This Movie Is truly a work of art. GREAT casting...Lots of action...Spellbounding background and special effects.. Even the story line  was indepth and riviting.  I cant wait to own this on DVD when it comes  out.  I watch ALLLLOOOTTT of movies and this is one of those that WILL meet  all the expectations and the 'hype' that it gets; trust me.
B00003CXGG|3.0|Jet Li is a great martial artist and a pretty darn good actor to boot, so his stuff is always at least pretty good.  This one was disappointing,  however.  A couple of nice fight scenes, particularly the little sparring  match on the roof with Russell Wong.  But over all there isn't enough kung  fu action for the martial arts afficionados and the story line is a little  too tired for the non martial arts crowd.  The Romeo and Juliet bit  actually plays pretty well, but overall this one is merely okay.  Jet Li  has done better (for example, Fists of Legend).  Let's hope his next outing  is back up to par.
B00004X01U|5.0|I've been a fan of Madonna's work for years now. I love the new album and can't wait to check out some of the remixes off Music.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie is plain fun.  Great mix of sci-fi high concept and kung fu action.  Lawrence Fishburne, who is always great, comes through again.   Keanu Reeves seems to be finally figuring out how to act, after a long and  painful (for his viewers) career.  This one is worth owning, just to watch  the fight sequences at will.
B00004X01U|5.0|Maddy has thrown down the gauntlet to pop music once again, daring her audience and contemporaries to follow her to the next big scene.  Is this a mainstream album?  With Madonna, she MAKES it mainstream with her amazing ability to fuse her knack for pop songwriting with her nose for fresh styles and sounds.<br />The first three tracks on the album tell you that the club is still open, and the joint is jumping.  But the AfterParty starts early:  The heart of the album is the middle, tracks 4-8.  Here Madonna retains the reflection of Ray of Light, but this time without the spiritual searching.  When you hear the twang of the acoustic guitar and the easy shuffle beats, you'll understand the album's cover and layout:  It's Space-Age Bachlorette Ranch Music.<br />&quot;I Deserve It&quot; begins as a mellow ode to a new love, drops down a streetwalkin' rhythm, then the spooky Western Movie-style strings by way of X-files-esque keyboards come in and you're under her spell.  &quot;Amazing&quot; continues this enchanting mood, before sliding into a fast number which is the song most reminiscent of Ray of Light.  &quot;Nobody's Pefect&quot; features the now-cliched Cher/&quot;Believe&quot;-style vocal effects, but somehow here it's appropriate.  The warbling of the voice suits the title and the subject matter.  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; manages to incorporate some country-style guitar picking, a head-bobbing beat, and lush strings.  Don't worry, it works.<br />&quot;What it Feels Like For a Girl&quot; is probably the album's masterpiece, and one of Madonna's finest hours.  Almost an update  of &quot;Express Yourself&quot;, this powerful song looks again at female empowerment, but in a more poignant way than her 1989 anthem.  It begins with a sample from another artist, which nicely sets up the theme.  If this doesn't become a number one single, it should at least inspire and affect many young women.  It moved me deeply, and I'm a straight male.<br />After a longer, trance-ytrack that is more a display of producer Mirwais' skills (it also appears on his album), but none the less a treat for the ears, we have the mellow and magnificent ballad &quot;Gone&quot;, the finale of the album.  Madonna hits an almost-Emmylou Harris level of singing here, and the results are sublime.  You walk out of the club, it's 5am, and there's just enough sunlight for you to find your way home.  Sweet dreams.
B00004W4UB|5.0|This is the best movie in which Julia Roberts ever appeared! The masses did not understand this sophisticated film with its morbid and haunting  atmosphere. The whole thing is stunning and Julia perfectly moves with  grace and understanding of her role! I had read the novel by Valerie Martin  upon which the movie is based and I must say that Frears, the director, was  able to make a perfect adaptation for the big screen. I own the European  DVD edition which is much richer in extras than the US version. If you like  movies with a soul then do not miss &quot;Mary Reilly&quot;!
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|every song on this album is great.  i've liked bjork for awhile now, but never been a huge fan (i once owned homogenic as well as post but sold them) due to the fact that for each album, there was 3-4 songs that i thought were absolutely beautiful while the rest was just filler.<br />i was worried about buying this, having only heard &quot;i've seen it all&quot; with guest vocals from thom from radiohead, but it was well worth my money.  if you haven't heard that song, it's nearly reason enough to buy this, but the other six tracks are gorgeous in their own perspective.  in the 32 minute journey, selmasongs covers a wide range of emotions from dark and dreary to upbeat and joyous.  the orchestral arrangements on this album are the best i've heard on a bjork album yet, and the ethereal street-sounds-made-beats are a unique yet awesome compliment to the music (and how could we forget about her beautiful voice?).<br />all in all, if you are a fan of bjork, this is a must have.  if you're not, this would not be a bad starting point either.
0800177177|5.0|GREAT vampire movie!  I can watch this over and over again and never get tired.  I would have to say if anyone were to ask me what is my favorite  movie of all time, it's this one.  Dracula, in this film has a love that  transcends time to find his beloved Mina.  His character was unbelievable,  the passion he had, the vengeance, the love - all added to the film.  Very  moving film, by the end you don't even realize that you wound up on  Dracula's side!
B000002KDO|5.0|Anyone who likes classic metal should own this one! Sabbath is certainly the most influentual bands of all time,and Master of Reality is to me, the best Sabbath album of all time and probably the best album period. Anyone who buys this album will instantly be hooked on it. Sabbath is both awesome and addictive and anyone who wants to hear a REAL heavy metal band, pick up this one and hear Sabbath at their best!  My favorites: After Forever, Into the Void, and Solitude.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|If you love time travel,action thriller moives with a VERY awesome ending   SEE THIS MOVIE.....   i saw it four times at the theater  and got goose  bumps at the end every time
0380788624|4.0|The book is worth the effort.  There are lots of digressions of varying degrees of importance.  A classic description of the science of eating Capt. Crunch.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Vin Diesel breaks out in this sci-fi alien thriller. The main focus is on Ridick (Diesel) who portrays a deadly criminal being transported on a  commercial space craft. The ship crashes forcing the passengers to survive  on a planet under three suns. What the survivors only later find out is  that the planet is inhabited by vicious nocturnal aliens. With the only  help coming from the man they fear most, the survivors must trust Ridick to  lead them to safety. The cast is not a well known one consisting of many  first time actors, yet with the strong character development of Diesel and  believable roles of supporting actors, big names weren't needed. With its  fantastic special effects and terrifying plot, Pitch Black is an awesome  movie experience!
6305807086|5.0|I rented this one, then bought it and the soundtrack.<br />A fantastic exploration of some pretty heavy questions, like:<br />What is gendered  embodiment?<br />What is agency?<br />What is identity?<br />Ultimately, the movie  even seems to suggest that the mere fact of asking these questions is  enough and the answers, if, in fact, &quot;THE answers&quot; exist, may not  be that important except in a personal sense.<br />Definitely worth the price  of admission.
B00004X01U|5.0|A friend of mine recently gave me a copy he swipped off of napster and I actually was fortunate enough to hear this CD one week before it was released...I felt so lucky.   Honestly, I was very nervous about this album after the ever stellar &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but come on people, that album has come and gone.  I believe that Madge deliveres some of her most poignant work on her new outing &quot;Music&quot;.  This album should be called &quot;fresh air for the musical doldrums of pop music&quot;.  Every song, while being backed by a hefty production team and most likely a heaftier budget, manages to please, but most likely not after the first listen.  The reason, we were expecting another &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.  After you get into the groove of music you realize how truly talented she is.  Here are some quickies on the tracks:<br />Music:  excellent mix of 70's funk, 80's electronica and a bit reminiscent of &quot;Everybody&quot;.  Catchy and sharp.  Overall a crowd pleaser.<br />Impressive Instant: A club pleaser to be sure.  I like the disco influence and the ambient bass.  A really cool song, and you get more into it with each listen<br />Runaway Lover:  What does she do with her voice on the last bridge(aka Walkin around on a cloud)?  It is so old school Madonna.  She sounds so into this song by the time it is over you wonder how she could not be singing from experience.<br />I Deserve It:  Funk Funk Funk and a lot of Folk.  Nice Track<br />Amazing:  1st listen, Beautiful Stranger Part 2, 2nd listen, awesome song.  The Guitiar in the background is the only Beautiful Stranger Reminant, but the song is very catchy and you find yourself humming it eventually while shaving in your bathroom<br />Nobody's Perfect:  Probably my least favourite.  I am not a fan of the vocoder, but I still get into the track...ranks up there with Mer Girl on my favourites chart<br />Don't Tell Me AND WHat It Feels Like... : These are my ab fab favourites on the CD.  They are the gems of this album.  Madge's voice on Don't Tell me is so silky smooth, and very etheral.  Mirwais encouraged her to try her lower vocal range and she sounds so incredible.  What it feels like...no words, I love this track, especially the intro<br />Paradise....awesome.  Although, the remix is very very cool(gotta hit the clubs to hear it kids).  Kind of like Insomnia from a few years ago by Faithless, but much updated.<br />Gone...passionate and personal.  The saddest song on the disc.<br />Enjoy folks.....she never seems to disappoint does she?  Gone are the Vogue days sadly, but she has brought a sound to pop music that the talentless artists(hmm...teen beat) have seemed to lost in their attempt.
630281474X|5.0|Probably the greatest Dracula film of all time! When I first saw this movie it was at the beach with my mom and I didn't know what was going to happen so it was pretty creppy. But as the end got nearer it was probably the best ending yet when Abraham Van Helsing (Peter Cushing)pulled down the curtains when it was dawn and it destroyed the mighty Count. But any how all of the actors did well with their parts and Terence Fisher directed it with his usual know-how.
B0000041DF|4.0|Martha Argerich is a genius. Her recorded legacy bears that out, and probably this Rachmaninov is a high point of that legacy. She is more an impersonator of music than a player.  That makes her a shamaness, and yet in that shaman self  -the self that eats the piano like an voracious carnivore-  one is strangely at times kept from her musical personality.  I notice this in her Bach.  I notice it perhaps less in this Rachmaninov, but then this is a concerto that issues a menu from which to quell every consuming appetite.  I've never heard a Ravel G Major finer than Argerich's.  Her recording of it with the Berlin is monumental, a giant.  I love Rachmaninov's 3rd, it's his finest piano concerto, and this version is riveting and unrelenting, shake-your-teeth-out wild, architectural, and beautiful at times.  I don't know if it's of true greatness.  The interesting thing is that Argerich's musical personality is so authentically deep and her musical language so natural, it's incongruous how often it's difficult to find it inside her Rachmaninov.  Sometimes, I miss the MUSIC.  The Tchaikovsky is more toned, to my ears, but what a tired piece.  Whatever Argerich plays, it's always worthy of deep listening.  She's a very human instrument of the gods.  See what you think.
B000002UVX|5.0|Jimi Hendrix, as everyone who already knows this knows, transcends all conventional categories.  He was the kind of visionary that pushed traditional genres (in his case, blues, R&amp;B, &quot;rock&quot;, &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;funk&quot;, etc.) way beyond their inherent limitations.  (Think: Mozart, Wagner, Coltrane, Miles Davis, Callas... the list is not endless, but you could add several more).  The revelation is that, once you've heard Jimi play the blues, for instance, (ye that have ears to hear), you realize that those &quot;inherent&quot; limitations aren't limitations at all, but rather, opportunities for ecstatic transcendence.  Listen here, for instance to the one note CRY that begins the gorgeous, terrifying, heart-ripping solo in &quot;Machine Gun.&quot;  -- De profundis clamavi -- &quot;OUT OF THE DEPTHS, I CRY&quot; --.  Jimi places it high in the reaches of our capacity to hear, like a hot star, and holds it till he can't hold it any longer, then CRYS AGAIN, insistently.  Finally, it breaks, falling like the bullet-riddled body of the &quot;soldier&quot; who is the speaker of the songs lyrics.  &quot;Machine Gun&quot; alone is worth twice the price of this album.  No, I'm wrong.  This recording can't be priced.  Add to that the stunning &quot;Power of Soul,&quot; &quot;Message to Love&quot; and even the Buddy Miles tracks, and you have about 45 minutes of REVELATION.  This, along with Electric Ladyland, is Jimi's crowning acheivment.  An added bonus:  The new remastered version has really great liner notes that are quite interesting and helpful toward a deeper understanding of the artist and the circumstances of the formation and short life of the Band of Gypsies.  This album is an absolute must.
B000000WF0|5.0|Hats Off to Urban Hymns. Amazing, problaby the best album in that year.  The Verve captures groove, rock, and soul. Richard Ashcroft has a beautiful voice. I listen to this album almost everyday. &quot;One Day&quot; and &quot;Lucky Man&quot; are two of my favorite tunes. Both with great lyrics with a wonderful meaning. This album takes true absorbing so sit back chill and enjoy .I'm a huge Verve fan so this is gold, it's a shame such a band broke up, but this album will keep their name alive and kicking. Bravo guys, you got a winner here.
B00003CXFV|4.0|This is a solidly entertaining and good movie.  Very much worth seeing.  Good story line, well developed with good acting.  A rare combination.  If  you didn't like this movie, then you probably are better suited to the  quality of Dumb and Dumber type movies, or worse yet, watching Perfect  Storm.
6301773551|5.0|Plain and simple, Star Wars is the undisputed lord of cinematographical SF&amp;F. Just like Lord of the Rings: some people hate it, others point to  different things and say that they like them more, but, really, no movie in  history had the impact on popular culture and the entertainment industry  that Star Wars had ever since its release back in 1977.<br />We all know the  semblance of the plot that Star Wars: A New Hope has: Luke meets Obi-Wan.  Luke and Obi-Wan meet Han. Luke, Obi-Wan, and Han go to the Death Star and  save Princess Leia. Princess Leia leads Luke to the rebels. Luke blows up  the giant..... of course, I can't tell you the ending. I can tell you,  however, that the plot is very thin. What saves the film, what gives it its  magic, is the great, life-like characters who behave like real people, who  dodge the fake-seeming laser blasts as if their lives depended on it. The  dialog is especially great. And, what's particularly amazing about Star  Wars is that the &quot;comic relief&quot; characters are actually tasteful  and particularly likeable.<br />The aliens are, without a doubt, outstanding  (save for the computer generated ones). There are many of them, and each  has a peculiar language of its own. I lose myself trying to describe their  appeal.<br />The sets fit in well with the plot and look very realistic -  probably because they are indeed real. There is no more alien place than  Earth itself - and Star Wars proves it. The shaky, unstable camera that at  times shows only a part of what is going on gives the film a sort of  life-like credence.<br />Star Wars: A New Hope is the beginning of the entire  Star Wars saga, whereas Episode I is instantly identifiable as a sequel.  Here, every character starts anew, with a life of his or her own. Each  earns our trust. Each will live forever in public memory.
B00000DFSK|5.0|Whether you're just getting started with U2 or you're a seasoned veteran, you must buy this CD. It captures everything that has made U2 the legions of fans they have worldwide.  Key tracks are \\"Where The Streets Have No Name,\\" \\"Pride,\\" \\"Bad,\\" and \\"I Will Follow.\\"  The B-side disc has its share of gems, as well.
B00002Z88D|1.0|God !!!! They managed to destroy the whole concept of a rock album with orchestra !!! How Kamen ( a superb maestro and musician ) entered into this fray ? METALLICA supreme arrogance reached new heights, when they allowed some of their classic albuns to be destroyed by the orchestra. THe orchestra plays bad ? Of course not !! It's just that the arangments has nothing to do at all with the songs !! I never listened to the CD after the first three times, it will be forgotten in my collection. METALLICA, you're history. I've got all your albuns (except for &quot;RELOAD&quot;). Never again, never again. I quit.
B00003CXHJ|3.0|The movie &quot;U571&quot; is a well made movie. Nice pictures, very good sound.<br />But the point, which I critize, is, that the film is rather  unrealistic. Think about the American soldiers, who learn how to use an  alien ship during a fight.  Moreover they are able to repair the boat and  to destroy a large battle ship with only one shot. <br />At least, as some of  other writers already said, hollywood changes historical facts for a better  selling in the USA.  And that should nobody do, especially with such a  special topic like the World War 2.
B00000FCBC|1.0|What a clever idea !!!! WHy not release the old covers, those really beloed by the old fans, in one single disc ? Great, more money !! But, why not put another CD with new covers, to make sure that the old fans doesn't think, even for a moment, that we're still great rockers ? Clever idea. The new covers are so gisgusting and uninspired... sad...
B000002J1S|5.0|Although uneven, perhaps a bit overlong, you'll find this album indispensible once you really let it sink in.  The reality is that Genesis, yes, were prog, and yes, did cut a double-album rock opera, but its certainly THE definitive statement of prog rock in the 70s.  And its so utterly different from anything they've ever done up to that point, its astounding.  The whole island of songs, starting from the opening floating piano keys of  &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; through &quot;Fly On a Windshield&quot; up to &quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot; is electrifying to an almost unearthly degree.  &quot;Back in NYC&quot; is a nasty, prog-punk opus.  And the soloing of Tony Banks on &quot;In The Cage&quot; surely establishes him as the keyboard master of the prog-rock kingdom.  The entire first disc nearly flawless, a treasure trove of musicality and boundless surprise.   The first two songs of side 2 certainly continue the mood, starting with &quot;Lillywhite Lilith&quot; and leading into the eerie, unearthly jam called &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; where the band starts with crashing sounds and space noises which sound something like a cat being beamed through outer space and somehow morphs into an insistent jam with another epic solo from Tony Banks.  But unlike most prog albums, its really when you dig into the lyrics that this album opens up to you.  The story and lyrics are rife with allegory, verbal double-entendres (especially in the last song, &quot;It&quot;), puns, and vivid imagery (&quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot;) interspersed with beautiful pearls of wisdom that it seems wonderous and astonishing that a rock album could be so interesting, so - literary.  I've heard interpretations from the mundane (based on a trip to NYC) to the almost preposterous (Rael as a christ-like figure).  But the music and story are so open to interpretation you'll probably always discover or think something new.  After this album, Peter left, spent and exhausted from touring with the Genesis and the story of Rael.   And things were still interesting for a while with Genesis, but they never got anywhere close to this album.  For my .02, neither did anyone else.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Like all pearl jam events - It's just hard to say.  As expected, with most of today's albums there are always 1 or two songs you can do without, and for me this is no exception. But to speak for myself, I usually only see one or two tracks in an album that I really love in some way as opposed to just really liking. This cd yeilds four tracks that are in my favorite pj efforts list, and 3 that are in my favorites list of all the music I've heard. God's Dice and nothing as it seems are two of the strongest most put together of the songs and both come from Jeff Ament who comes out to be quite possibly the strongest or close second strongest influence on the entire record. I certainly have a new respect for his abilities as well as stone gossard's song writing talents. Eddie is still the one who probably shapes the album itself the most because of his broad vocal talents, occasional well balanced instrumental capabilities and conceptual endeavors. There are surprises like Soon forget which is done by only Eddie's lyrics, voice, and ukalele. And the completely different but near perfect ''Of the Girl'' compliments of Gossard. The vibes are completely unlike anything pj has done, but totally on the mark as well. This album yeilds country and folk vibes here and there and a personal sentimentality that is unusual. In some ways this maybe there best record. It is broad and layered and musically challenging and it takes more than one listen to like straight through. Whether lecturing against Hate or greed or singing of love or plain displays of dimentia, it is a lyrical and musical wonder like all pj records. A pleasant surprise is the fresh vibe of matt cameron the new drummer. Though a small surprise is Mike McCready's absence of writing in lyrics and music. Strangely enough I disliked the album and thought it tired and weak and jaded after the first listen with the ignorant and nervous skipping I do when I listen to a new effort of a band I already have high expectationsfor and love of. To wrap up my comments of the record, it is a typical sound from an original band- completely unpredictable. But if given the chance of more than one spin and some patience, it is easily up with the rest of their work in all ways and better in some.
B00004X01U|5.0|This is by far the best music Madonna has made. I thought Ray of Light was an amazing cd but Music is AWESOME! She has outdone herself again with Music. All of the songs are amazing and different in their own way. This is the best and most interesting cd of the year. So if you like Madonna you'll love this cd.
B000000WHX|4.0|This album is must-have for any one who listens to this genre... the soul of this album has been stolen from repeatedly since its release in 1991 but what is it that they say about leaders and their sheep? Listen to the samples, but do yourself a favor and add this classic to your collection... also check out Massive Attack's Protection released in 1995...
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|On the surface, this CD does not have much going for it. Firstly, it is bound to be compared with the magnificent &quot;Homogenic&quot;. Secondly, it is a Soundtrack album (very few artists have been able to navigate these treacherous waters). Thirdly, it was written under the well-documented stress of making the movie. It has also been roundly panned by some music critics who usually  are foaming at the mouth in adulation at her work. Having now heard it, some pluses should be mentioned. Firstly, &quot;Selmasongs&quot; does not contain anything remotely as awful (imho) as &quot;It's Oh so quiet&quot;, or as superfluous (again, imho) as &quot;Someone in Love&quot;, two &quot;Show tune&quot; songs from previous albums. There is also a cohesiveness here sometimes lacking in Bjork's other work. One of the problems with Bjork (everyone should be so lucky) is that she is only intermittently brilliant. &quot;Debut&quot; was 1/4 brilliant, &quot;Post&quot; was 1/2 brilliant, &quot;Homogenic&quot; 3/4 brilliant. This tends to lead to albums that are excellent, but feel unbalanced. &quot;Selmasongs&quot; is not the 100% brilliant album she is capable of making. Perhaps being freed from an acting career will push her to write it. What &quot;Selmasongs&quot; is, is consistently good, sometimes very good. I am not in the least bit disappointed with this purchase.
0790743132|5.0|This 1942 film is a classic, and rightly so.

It's release<br />coincidentally coincided with the Nazi occupation of France, and its<br />theme and its timeless love story caught the public's<br />imagination.<br />Casablanca in French Morocco is under French rule and<br />one of the places in the world where refuges can get safe passage<br />visas to go on to Lisbon and eventually to America and freedom.  It is<br />seething with intrigue and corruption.  Humphrey Bogart is an<br />ex-patriot American citizen who runs Rick's Cafe, where much of the<br />commerce takes place.  Peter Lorre is a smuggler, Sidney Greenstreet<br />is a black marketeer, and Martin Dooley is the piano player known as<br />Sam.<br />When, one evening Ingrid Bergman comes in to the cafe on the<br />arm of her husband, Paul Heinreid, and asks the piano player to<br />&quot;play it Sam&quot;, he reluctantly plays &quot;As Time Goes<br />By.&quot; This melody which is played throughout the movie, is the<br />glue that defines the romance.  There's electricity between the<br />lovers.  There's intrigue and double dealing.  Something exciting<br />happens in each scene.  And the acting is so good that it brought me<br />right into Casablanca.  The story is always clear.  The danger is<br />always there.  The tension sizzles.<br />One particularly meaningful<br />scene was when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an<br />ominous song to the &quot;Fatherland&quot;.  It makes everyone in the<br />Rick's cafe very uncomfortable.  That's when Paul Heinried instructs<br />the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the<br />&quot;Marseilles&quot;.

6304618344|5.0|Sean Archer (Travolta) has been chasing Castor Troy (Cage) to avenge his son's death by the hands of the psychotic terrorist for six years. Now that  he killed Castor, Sean must find a biological bomb by assuming the identity  of Castor Troy by taking his face and being brought in prison. But Troy,  who awakes from his coma, takes Archer's face in order to take revenge on  him. Now, Troy turns Archer's life upside down by assuming his identity.  Will Archer break free from his prison and get his face back, or will Troy  have the last laugh ? <br />Face/Off is a smart, engagingly impressive film  that you won't be able to take your eyes. Nicholas Cage puts on an  extremely impressive performance as does the almighty John Travolta. The  direction from John Woo shows definite effort, this is one of his best  films.<br />Face/Off is a watchable and brilliant film that will keep you  entertained until the credits roll. It is certainly one of the better  action/thriler's of 1997.
6300213803|5.0|From 1982, this is by far my choice for best Star Trek. The story is interesting, it's exceptionally well written, and  William Shatner looks mighty fine.<br />What makes this film special and worth 5 stars, is my all time favorite screen villain, Khan. Ricardo Montalban is absolutely fabulous. There are subtleties in this performance that make it a joy to watch repeatedly...his expressive, beautiful hands, his amazing voice...&quot;Let them eat static !&quot;. This is not a one-dimensional character. He is smooth, evil, and even sympathetic at times. What a stupendous bad guy !<br />I must add a personal anecdote about the man behind this marvelous villain. Mr. Montalban is the kindest, most giving soul I have ever met. I'm sure he had no idea, nearly 40 years ago, what a huge impact his humanity had on my life. Thank you Ricardo, for being a guardian angel on this earth.
0780631684|4.0|I saw this movie in theatres and if you're the type that likes thriller fims that actually have a smart plot, then you'll love this.  The acting is amazing and Devon Sawa puts out a great performance.  I highly recommend it to teenagers and early 20's.  Its a great movie!
B00004X01U|5.0|MADONNA's new album MUSIC is truly AMAZING! The Most Successful Female Recording Artist In The World (MADONNA) is at it again! This album shows how MADONNA continues to evolve, even after 17 years since her debut back in 1983. Now on MUSIC, MADONNA is just having one heck of a Great Time! MUSIC seems to have a few layered songs like the Ray of light album did. These songs are &quot;IMPRESSIVE INSTANT&quot; and &quot;RUNAWAY LOVER.&quot; Now these songs are as close as you will get to the Ray of Light sound! MADONNA is now exploring a new style of music and merging such styles as Folk with European Electronic Music, and creating a whole new syle of sound! MUSIC has some stand out tracks such as, DON'T TELL ME, AMAZING, WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL, GONE, NOBODY'S PERFECT, and the Dance Club anthems, IMPRESSIVE INSTANT and RUNAWAY LOVER. Now thats almost every song o the album! The only song I did not care for was PARADISE (NOT FOR ME), which had MADONNA whispering through a lot of the song. This song was way beneath MADONNA's ability to deliver a great ballad! The remaining tracks on the Album more than made up for that one song. The MUSIC album is just so Refreshingly New and is one of those CD's you can listen to over and over. With this new MADONNA album there is no no controversey, or any other distractions, which is what so many people tend to focus on, which is  probably why MADONNA just named her album MUSIC. This album is TRULY AMAZING and just goes to show us all like usual that when it comes to MUSIC, only MADONNA can lead, and be two steps ahead of the rest! MADONNA's New album MUSIC gets 5 stars!
B00004U9MS|5.0|There is little doubt in my mind that Coldplay are going to rule the world of music in the near future.  No, this is not an exageration - their debut album really is that good.  Smooth guitar playing, amazing vocals, clever lyrics and exceptionally catchy melodies all help to propel this album forward leaving a calm and relaxing atmosphere in it's wake.  With summer anthems such as 'Shiver', successful singles such as 'Yellow', and smooth tracks such as 'Trouble' and 'High Speed' all confined to this 10 track masterpiece, it wets the mouth with anticipation to think of the possibility (please!!!) of a follow up album.  Anyone who has bought this album already will tell you how good it is - easily my album of the year, and I don't think anything will beat it!  A 'must have' for anyones CD collection!
B00004Z4SD|4.0|One of the most inspirational movies in recent memory.  Lynch takes his time telling this true story of a man who rides his lawnmower across  several states for one last visit with his sick brother.  Why a lawnmower?   Because he's almost blind and this is all he's got.<br />Lynch lets the story  unfold slowly and some may be put off by the lazy pace.  &quot;Why isn't  anything happening?&quot; was a frequent complaint I heard.  I found the  pace a welcome change from the MTV-style editing that is so prevelant.   Straight Stories'  slower style is a perfect parallel for the mower's crawl  across Midwest America.  Lynch lingers on shots and fully develops his  protagonist while also tossing in some strong supporting characters.   Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his multi-layered performance.  The  ending is a bit weak after such a long build-up, but there is a certain  poetry in the last shot.  Give this unconventional story a chance, you  won't be disappointed.
B00004X01U|5.0|Once again the brilliant Madonna comes out to show us how it really is.  Beautiful beats of electronic sounds and bass dat could make ur speakers blow. The best songs on this album are....well all of them.  But the ones with the most awesome rhythm and the most awesome vocals by Madonna are...Paradise, Gone, What it Feels like for a Girl, Don't Tell Me and of course Music.  The other songs are also out of this world, literally. Impressive Instant takes us to another dimension, Runaway Lover takes us to the dance floor, Amazing takes us back to rbit, Nobody's Perfect takes us inside Madonna, and I Deserve It brings Madonna to you. The album is one of the best I've heard in a long time, with collaboration from Mirwais Ahmadzai, William rbit also comes back to the rescue, and of course with Madonna herself.  She just keeps getting better and better.  To any True Madonna Fans...Do you really need to have someone tell you How Good Madonna and Her Music are?  And when the Music Starts I never Want to Stop.
0790749998|3.0|&quot;Romeo Must Die&quot; is a perfect movie for a weekend. Jet Lee is one of the many Asian actors who has not been given his due worth yet.  The  rivalry between the two families in U.S.was the basic parameter of the  movie BUT definately worth a watch.
B00004X01U|5.0|There are so many things that I would like to say about this album, but 1000 words wouldn't be enough. 'Music' is a great song, that now everyone knows, but that's just the begining. She has outdone herself again! Whether you liked the song 'Music' or not, you will love this album. Madonna has mixed electronic sounds with the most melodic beats you'll ever hear! Track 8 'What It Feels Like For A Girl' is arguably the best track. Both the music mixed with the very truthful lyrics are unbelieveable! I highly recommend this cd to anyone under 60, and maybe over, cause even my grandma loves it!
B00004X01U|5.0|For those of you who might be disappointed with MUSIC... give it a week.  I've been listening to this CD for awhile now via the internet.  My first impression was how much it's NOT like Ray of Light.  And THANK GOD!  Who wants to hear Ray of Light 2.0?  Did we ever get a Bedtime Stories 2.0 or a Like a Prayer 2.0?  Is that the Madonna that we know and love?  Would she really do that to us?  Of course not.  <br />In fact, the stuff that sounds familiar was the most disappointing for me.  &quot;Amazing&quot; sounds like the song they DIDN'T choose for Austin Powers 2 and I'm glad, because &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; was the perfect pop song.  And &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; just doesn't have that edgy feeling that the faster stuff on RAY OF LIGHT had.<br />The title track is by far one of her best dance songs ever.  Lyrically it's not very thoughtful (except for the ingenious line &quot;Music makes the bourgeoisie and the rebel&quot;), but it doesn't have to be. That's the point.<br />Some of my favorite tracks are the ones that people seem to immediately dislike.  &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; is a beautiful ballad.  Yes, there is too much vocal distortion and it's over produced.  That's the point.  It's still beautiful because imperfection is beautiful.  I wonder how everyone else failed to see the irony in that.  &quot;I deserve it&quot; reminds me of what Everlast and Beck have done by mixing folk elements with hip hop elements.  &quot;Paradise&quot; is sooo not the Madonna that we grew up with, and I love it.  The slow stuff in this record is where she really shines, trust me.<br />Even if you'll hate almost every song on this CD, buy it just for &quot;What it feels like for a girl&quot; (thankfully slated to be the second single).  You won't be disappointed.
B00003CXE7|5.0|The Gladiator is a story of a true hero.  I was not sure if Hollywood could ever produce this kind of hero, but they proved me wrong.  The plot is a very simple one; it is about a war hero, Marcus Aralias who becomes a gladiator in the 'rural' part of the Roman Empire.  He goes to Rome to do battle in the Coliseum as a gladiator.  The end of the story just has to be seen, so I will not reveal the end...  Overall a fabulous movie, I would suggest it to history and action buffs, even my sister liked it and we were both in tears at the end of it...
B00003W8NM|5.0|Leave it to the &quot;family groups&quot; in this country, who can't take responsibility for raising their own kids, to file so many loud and  thoughtless objections against this incredible movie.  &quot;Fight  Club&quot; is one of the most original and ingeniously written, directed,  and acted films that has come along in a very, very long time, and its  ultimate message about society is far more intelligent and responsible than  the critics and censors even tried to give it credit for, but would have if  they'd just *paid attention to it*!   The initial story of Jack and Tyler  is utterly hilarious in its shocking tastelessness; we laugh at its plot  twists in the same sense that we laugh at the inspired rudeness of  &quot;South Park.&quot;  The violence is not so frequent OR graphic as I'd  been led to believe, because David Fincher's incredible directing makes the  violent moments both very funny at times, and at others, more disturbing  than a lot of blood and guts ever could.  You will find yourself, by turns,  both amused and horrified at the ideas and images presented in this  provocative film, and you WILL remain constantly engaged.  The  &quot;surprise ending&quot; definitely warrants at LEAST a second viewing,  but I don't feel that it holds the whole story together as sensibly as it  should... though it does do a pretty understandable and consistent job  around 95% of the time.  It's hard to fully describe and analyze  &quot;Fight Club&quot; without writing a veritable 10-page paper, but all I  can say to the easily offended is, just grow up and enter this movie with  an open mind... you'll be surprised at how interesting and responsible it  ultimately is.  The world should be glad for a director like Fincher, who  can handle material like this both intelligently and fearlessly.  The  performances of Norton, Pitt, and Carter are absolutely first-rate, and  their dialogue is utterly brilliant.  There is nothing to complain about  over this movie; instead,there should be celebration of its originality,  reverence for the talent that created it, and respect for the dangerous  ideas that it isn't afraid to confront.  Whether you love it or hate it,  there's no denying that &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of those very few  films that you simply must see, even if only to see what all the fuss is  about!
B00000JGEF|5.0|Predator is a fast-paced, suspenseful, frightening, dramatic, action-adventure film that takes the viewer into the South American jungle  and makes him feel part of Arnold's team.  This film offers so much that  Arnold's other films, with exceptions, do not seem to compare.  It was  almost like a whodunnit, and when you find out and see who actually dunnit,  you can't believe it.  An invisible alien preying on anyone who gets in his  way.  Many critics claim that the movie had no purpose because why would  the mother-ship dump the alien on some far away planet by himself.  But,  who cares.  If you think about it too much you might miss the action and  excitement.  I think number 2 answered some questions, but number one  started the phenomena.  For a classic Schwarzenegger movie, you can't miss  this one.  It's truly up there with the Terminator movies.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I have just seen this movie and must admit that this is undoubtebly the funniest film i have ever seen. Me and my friends couldnt stop laughing from start to finish. Excellent comedy. Highly recommeneded!
0553269631|5.0|I only read this book because it was on a \\"Top 100\\" list a while back.  Much to my surprise, it was one of the best books I have ever read.  The characters were very identifiable and refreshing.   The writing style was easy to read and non-pretentious.  It was a great book on human understanding and emotion.  I thoroughly recommend this book!
B00004U2A1|5.0|I had heard lots of things about the evil dead trilogy. my closest friends, who are, although not to my extent, film buffs, said they weren't  worth the money. but i thought: &quot;they sound like my kinda film, ill  read up about em&quot; so i did, and boy was i glad i did! I then went  ahead and bought all three on DVD, including this Limited Edition version  of Evil Dead 2. Wow. The film, pure cheese. But you can see that so much  effort has gone into it you can't help but love it. Its twisted plot and  visual humour make it an unstoppable tour de force, especially after a  boozy night on the town! This edition is excellent not only for the film,  but due to the hard work that has gone into creating it.<br />The picture and  sound quality is astounding, very crisp and clear at all times. There is  even a THX optimode test for those of us who like messing with the telly to  get the best picture and sound.<br />But its the special features that make  this DVD a must. The Gore the merrier!&quot; featurette is both informative  and fun to watch, and the extra booklet is highly interesting. The whole  groovy package is wrapped up in a special edition numbered tin. okay, so it  sticks out like a sore thumb amoung the other dvds in my collection, being  a good 1-2 inches taller, but it helps make it more eye-catching. <br />All in  all a must buy! Groovy film, groovy overall package, groovy quality on all  counts, and at an even groovier price. Later deadheads!<br />Predator the  deadite slayer
0064471837|5.0|Possibly one of the greatest fantasy adventures of our times, Garth Nix's first novel is a lush, magical, dark-witty adventure about a young woman's battle with the hideous Dead.<br />The story starts with a flashback in which a special necromancer named Abhorsen saves his baby daughter Sabriel from a  creature called Kerrigor, in the spiritual river of death. Many years  later, at an English-esque boarding school, Sabriel must take up her  father's magical sword and bells and try to find out what has happened to  him. To do so, she must leave her relatively high-tech home for the Old  Kingdom, where magic rules and evil things are stalking her.<br />Along the  way, she is accompanied by the guard Touchstone and the menacing/funny  cat-spirit Mogget. They must try to defeat the evil Kerrigor, who wants to  blast the Charter which keeps all things from descending into  evil.<br />Sabriel is the best fantasy hero I've read about since Lord of the  Rings. Too many fantasy heroines are either damsels or warrior  women--Sabriel is neither. She acts and thinks precisely like a young woman  in her position. Strong, intriguing, and no slack with a sword in a bad  situation, she is a wonderful role model.<br />Touchstone is a darling, but  Mogget really is unique. Is he evil? Good? Or some peculiar mix? This  ancient spirit forced to live as a cat is enslaved to the Abhorsen family  for the good of everyone (we get a glimpse of how dangerous he is). The  world that Garth Nix dreamed up, a mixture of Tolkien and WW2 England, is  unparalleled in the fantasy genre. It's populated by animated ghouls,  ghastly Mordicants, the almost-human sendings, Charter ghosts, the  inhabitants of the river of Death, where only Abhorsens go, and so on...<br />His writing style is lush and hypnotic--you can actually see the events  unfolding in front of your eyes, in this wintry but inviting world.<br />Thankfully, Mr. Nix appears to be writing a pair of sequels--I can  hardly wait. Anyone else think this should be made into a movie?else think this should be made into a movie?<br />
B00001ZWTT|4.0|Wild Wild West should have been taken with all the seriousness of an easy going action flick.  Instead most people decided it had to live up to  strict standards and expectations.  The movie was funny!  The jokes weren't  laught-a-second in coming but most of them worked.  The movie was pretty,  even picturesque, to look at.  Every set was nicely detailed and furnished,  and visually the movie was convincing that it was in in 1800s.  The plot  was supposed to be taken with a grain of salt.  I don't know why some  people think its more believable that in Speed Keanu had to tip over a  train to stop it, than this movie was.  Simply letting the plot ease along  is good for you!  The acting was finely done.  Will Smith, Kevin Kline, and  Kenneth Branaugh are all fine actors who did a great job with the simple  script and plot and made it all look easy, clever, and real.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|THis movie was the one of the funniest i have ever seen in my  entire life.  they make fun of all the horror movies. u need to have seen the  horror movies to actually get what they are talking about in this movie,  but if you havent seen all the movies SCARY MOVIE is still hilarious.  a  MUST SEE movie
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Very different from her other masterpieces, fantastically unique.  It has the ability to transport you to the surrealism in urbanism... Its worth every penny!
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Words, people use too many.<br />This is a Bjork album. <br />It's too short.<br />It's brilliant.<br />She said after Homogenic that she would never make another album like that.<br />Thus far, she has stuck to her word. <br />This album reminds me a lot of the first two, combined with the more electronic experimentation that occured on the previously mentioned Homogenic.<br />If you love Bjork, you will love this record. <br />If you are not fimiliar with Bjork, it's as good a place as any to start. Plus, a movie accompanies this album. Bonus.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|For starters, get ready for a ride because once the action begins it never stops. But what makes this movie is the intelligently written dialogue. I  rank this movie at least equal to &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot;, its a  little more raw and very refreshing!
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|The reason why Bjork will never ascend to commercial wonderland is also the reason why her music &amp; personality is so fascinating. The reason - her odd and experimental music. Selmasongs, which are songs culled from the movie Dancer In The Dark where she also won critical acclaim as well as a Best Actress trophy for her performance, is a continuation of her ever ingenious probe into the music world. From the dramatic opening, Overture, to the dark and haunting ballad with Tom Yorke of Radiohead, I've Seen it All and the wonderful conclusion New World, the music sets the stage for the scenes in the movie. Excellent effort!
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Bjork has made so much fantastic music and this just adds to her successes. The moving beats and flowing melodies give you a sense of joy and sorrow at the same time. Her haunting voice echoes in the hallways of your subconscious and it awakens something inside of you. Ultimately you come out with a feeling of awe. This is a great cd for anyone and I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B000002P5R|5.0|Simply put, Hey Baby is the most beautiful yet jagged song that I have ever heard. The rest of the album is great as well. It is very obvious that this was a work in progress, but it is great nonetheless. We will never know what Jimi would have done had he lived longer, but I think the music speaks for itself. Hearing his solo on Hey Baby makes me close my eyes and envision him standing here in front off me. Then after the song is over, it makes me want to go pick up my guitar and conjure his spirit through my hands and his music.
0375501851|5.0|I admit, I bought this because I was under the impression it was a &quot;cool&quot; read, something anyone up on literature had on his/her shelf (much like that Dave Eigers book -- which proved to be a very over rated &quot;cool&quot; book).  Not only was it cool, but I believe it made me a better person; its insights made me rethink contemporary culture, our obsession with scientific advancement, our misguided race relations, and the complexities of religious faith.  I was afraid the book might be a little too much like Rushdie (another author I find over rated)and a little too overwritten and ostentatious, but my fears were quickly put to rest; Smith's prose and ideas are brilliant, but she's no show off.  All of this.  And I couldn't put it down.  (By the way, I am still convinced I looked cool reading it...)
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Every generation has its car movie.  (Bullitt, Smokey and the Bandit, etc...)  This is definitely ours.  Everything from Diablos to vintage Ferraris to the star: a '67 Shelby GT500.  The final car chase is unreal.  Of course its over the top, but it does things very tongue-in-cheek.  Good acting, good visuals, good soundtrack, and great opening sequence.  I hope the DVD is filled with goodies.
B00004TL21|2.0|Just to let you know that despite the 2-star rating, I think this is a great CD, but if you're planning on getting it (which I highly recommend) you better do so after October 3rd, because 'Back To School' (Mini-Maggot) will be added to the CD.  Unfortunately for the 500 000 who already bought this CD, you have to go through the tedious ordeal of going into the multimedia portion on your computer (it's an enhanced CD) and downloading the new song if you really want it.  I'm glad that the band thought about those who already purchased it, but unfortunately, my computer is too slow and I can't access the multimedia portion of the CD, so I lose out.  Go figure...
B00004Z4SD|5.0|A lot of people have David Lynch pegged as a filmmaker obsessed with darkness, depravity, grotesquerie, perversion and weirdness for its own sake.  Not to sound too ....., but these people are immune to visual poetry and should stick with Adam Sandler or Schwarzeneggar movies.  Yes, there are some elements of all of the above in Lynch's work, but always too there is a sense of humanity, a certain skewed grace.  With The Straight Story, the spirituality that has always been present in Lynch's films comes more prominently to the fore than it ever has before (with the possible exception of The Elephant Man).  The Straight Story lacks much in the way of outright strangeness in terms of content, but the general oddness of Lynch's style, his unique sense of composition and editing rhythms, his whole way of seeing, is very much in evidence here.  Based on the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man who made a 300-mile journey by riding mower to see his estranged brother, The Straight Story is so, well, straightforward and simple that it achieves a kind of purity.  By all accounts, on a personal level Lynch is an unusually warm, sweet guy and I can believe it. This film couldn't have been made by someone who wasn't a fundamentally clear-eyed, good man, and the deep-down decency of Straight is accordingly made palpable by the deep-down decency of the director.  When Alvin finally meets up with his ailing brother, the film ends with an exchange between the two that is so understated and eloquent that it's almost startling in its power.  Eschewing any trace of cheesey sentimentality, Lynch makes a statement about the importance of love and forgiveness that even the most hardened cynic would be moved by.  If you missed this in the theater, the widescreen DVD is the only way to go.  Don't miss this remarkable film.
0783113145|5.0|What riveting performances Palminteri and De Niro Turn in on this excellently written (by Palminteri) and scripted film. Palminteri's performance will have you spellbound from his very first scene until his tragic final one. De Niro does an excellent job of directing here.  De Niro also paints a very impassioned and sympathetic picture of an Italian father (the role originally played by Palminteri on Broadway) fighting desperately to win his son back from a ruthless, but charming mobster. De Niro is truly the greatest actor of all time. Another standout is Lillo Brancato as De Niro's confused but basically good son Callogero, torn between the mentoring of criminal Sonny and his dad, Lorenzo. One of the greatest movies of all time. Definitely worth watching and rewatching over and over again. Truly a first class movie all the way!
B00004X01U|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT MADONNA'S NEW-FOUND ENLIGHTENMENT ON LIFE.AND I MUST SAY IT IS A VERY BEAUTIFUL ALBUM.SONGS LIKE &quot;MUSIC&quot; AND &quot;RUNAWAY LOVER&quot; ARE GOOD DANCE SONGS.AND THEN YOU HAVE SONGS LIKE &quot;NOBODYS PERFECT&quot; AND  &quot;PARADISE (IS NOT FOR ME)&quot; WHICH ARE NICE AND SLOW.ALL AROUND MADONNA'S DONE IT AGAIN THIS ALBUM IS MY FAVORITE NEXT TO &quot;RAY OF LIGHT&quot; AND &quot;LIKE A PRAYER&quot;.A DEFINANT MUST HAVE FOR MADONNA FANS.
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara Fabian, virtually came out of nowhere in the United States.  Although, she's had much success in France she's just now getting noticed here with her first English album.  What pulled me in was the hypnotic &quot;I Will Love Again&quot; the one few fast track on the whole album.  The rest of the album resembles somewhat of a Celine Dion later album and as strong as a Barbara Streisand album.  The captivating &quot;Adagio&quot; shows her true vocal talent.  &quot;Broken Vow&quot; shows how she can really put the emotion into her songs.  I bought this CD about a week after it was first released and I still can't put it down.  I can't wait for the next release.
B00004X01U|5.0|After Madonna released &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, no one thought she could ever top it. I never thought she could, anyways. But The Material Girl proved everyone wrong and that she's still got it at 42. &quot;Music&quot; is impressive, filled with synthesized highs and lows that make each song an electronic masterpiece, the piece de resistance being Madonna's gorgeous voice. Her bare vocals on &quot;I Deserve It&quot; reminds us of her vocal talent, and &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, probably my favorite, is an aching piece, where she tries to convey how beautiful it is to be a girl, and how much men don't understand it. I would have appreciated a few more songs on this album, after all, it only runs 45 minutes, compared to Ray of Light's 66, but her talent is simply overwhelming, and greatly appreciated throughout the world. I believe she'll be able to top Music in another few years.
B0000009S3|5.0|I love Frank Zappas music.  And there sure is a variety of it to choose from.  My first album was The Grand Wazoo, and man did that Jazz album really set the proper stage for me to admire Frank.  My second purchase was Hot Rats ( even though it was recorded first) and it just sealed my love for his music.  I just assumed Frank was a jazz musician although later, I learned that he was much more than that. The only critique I have for Hot Rats is the Remixd CD.  I think it is terrible compared to the sound quality of the LP album.  The album has a much better tone with much richer bass and drums.  If you can find the album, listen to it and you will see what I mean.  Fortunately, the Grand Wazoo sounds exactly like the LP album. Was Frank a genius?  I don't know, but he sure made a jazz noise here.
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle Ferrell is more than, &quot;In A Class By Herself.&quot; <br />Rachelle Ferrell is &quot;The Class.&quot;  <br />The lyrics on this CD are thoughtful and insightful, the music on this CD is unpredictable, the melodies are soothing, the beats are down right funky (George Duke) the flavor of this CD is mystical, and yet Rachelle's voice still gives a certain reassurance that true creativity and talent is not dead!!!   <br />THANK YOU, RACHELLE!!!<br />I have had several opportunities to see Ms. Ferrell, (on tour with George Duke and Kenny Lattimore) between her last CD and &quot;Individuality.&quot; One thing will always ring true with Ms. Ferrell, &quot;What you see, (and hear) is what you get.&quot;<br />Eargasms and Toe Tappin's is what this CD promises.  From the wonderful cut, &quot;Sistah&quot; that reminds us of the special bond women share, to &quot;Gaia&quot; (duet with Jonathan Butler) all the way to &quot;I Can Explain,&quot; yields nothing but pure unabashed joy for the listener.<br />Some might say &quot;Welcome Back,&quot; to Rachelle after listening to this CD. The truth of the matter is, she never left; for how does one forget the sound of excellence once it has been heard.<br />ONE WOMAN'S ADVICE: BUY THIS CD...you will not be dissapointed.<br />**Let's stop accepting mediocrity as an artform...buy this CD and let your voice be heard.
6302453356|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. No matter how many times I see it, it feels magical with each viewing. I simply cannot understand how some people find it boring. It is lengthy, but for once length is good thing. There's that much more to enjoy! The people who hated this movie must be pirates because I cannot come up with any other explanation of why someone would.
B000002I25|5.0|this is one of, if not the, best albums in rock music history; the combination of Ray Manzarek's, Robby Kreger's, John Densmore's, and of course Jim Morrison's talents make a truly impressive debut album; although the music and/or lyrics on this album are definitely not intended to be relaxing or soothing, it most definitely does sound great; moreover, it makes you think, which is what I believe Jim Morrison wanted all of us to do when we listen to this music; overall, an exceptional piece of work from a legendary group, and Jim Morrison's vocals will always be my favorite. If you don't have this album, GET IT!!!!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|All I have to say is this movie was te best movie released so far this year. I was impressed witht the story and the action. As everyone has stated here, there is a lot of blood but because the movies is so well done and written you can almost look past those horrific scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone and refund them there money if they did not like it becasue i am sure almost anyone will enjoy this movie.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Can Jerry Bruckheimer make a bad movie? I think not! This is yet another spectacular action flic with the most incredible line up cars imaginable from classics like the Ford Mustang to the rare Jaguar XJ220. And on top of all of this a typically cool Nicholas Cage and some breathtaking stunts. Great, likeable characters.  It also pulls the new younger croud of actors as well as the usual superstars like Cage, Robert Duvall and Delroy Lindo which gives very good contrast.  Gotta have this one on DVD or you haven't lived!
B00003CXDG|3.0|Who here did honestly not like Face/Off? Or Broken Arrow for that matter? They were both done by helmer John Woo, who left Hong Kong for Hollywood several years ago. Now he has created the second installment in the MI series; which proves to be little more than a nonchalant Tom Cruise vehicle. Not that I hated it, I just expected more. Much more. The cinemotgraphy is of course beautiful, and put together in a sort of arty Jerry ('Con Air', 'Gone in 60 Seconds') Bruckheimer way. But the excitement is only really there for the first fifteen minutes, and the last thirty-five. Predictable it is. Although the acting, especially by Sir Anthony Hopkins, is for the most part crisp and realistic, the overall impression of pic is a slightly lacklustre momentum, interlaced with short bursts of entertainment. That said, I'm still getting the DVD.
079284131X|5.0|&quot;IM GONNA GET YOU NO MATTER WHAT&quot; CHUCKY QUOTES IN THIS FILM, AND BELIEVE ME HE GETS YOU ALRIGHT HE GETS YOU ENTERTAINED THAT IS!!! IF YOU WANT TO BUY A GOOD HORROR THEN GET THIS!
6305807086|4.0|I heard one newscaster (maybe from CNN) mention BJM but I did not know who the actors were (not even sure if John was included) nor have I seen the trailer.  So when I viewed the movie, together with my husband, it was really a pleasant surprise!<br />We all know how unique the screenplay was, no need to go into details.  &amp; all throughout the movie, I did not recognize Cusack nor Diaz, just Malkovich.  Just imagine how you can enjoy watching a movie when most of the characters seemed alien to you--- &amp; you did actually enjoy it!<br />It's funny, at the same time sad, to realize how people are so dissatisfied with their own lives &amp; would even pay to be someone else, even for a very short time.  &amp; to think that the people we admire are happy &amp; content in their shell is a big misnomer as well! Is life really that cruel that noone can find contentment in themselves?<br />Another idea conveyed in the movie is man's fear of death.  We saw how the 'old folks' evaded death &amp; their continuos search for immortality by entering &amp; hiding in another person's brain/portal, or whatever you may call it.<br />Yes, the movie is really unique.  At a glance, it is funny because the characters acted weird &amp; comic.  But at a closer look, you will realize that there are lessons/values strongly registered which the writer/creator wanted to convey to his/her viewers.
0486282112|4.0|Frankenstein is one of the most famous horror stories of all time. The novel tells the chilling story of an ambitious young scientist and his chance to play God.  But the creature turns on him, and a struggle between creator and creation ensues.  The story has been changed so many times since it was written so it was interesting to read the original.  As in all literature, fancy and elaborate descriptions take precedence over the action of the plot.  Frankenstein is a classic horror story even though is hard to read at times.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Though I have heard about the title for a long time &amp; I knew there was a headless horseman, I really did not know the in-between plot.  So when I saw the DVD in our shop, I eagerly watched it with my husband.<br />Sure, the setting, especially at the start, was spooky, what with the jack-o-lanterns &amp; the sprawling fog.  There was also the continuous brewing mystery among the 'old town officers' &amp; their knowledge/connection with the mysterious decapitations happening in Sleepy Hollow.  The twist of events will surely catch you off-guard.<br />Johnny Depp/Ichabod was a funny character.  He portrayed an investigator promoting his latest techniques/discoveries in the crime field.  But despite the profession he got himself into, he was not really a tough guy but more of a scaredy cat.  He made me laugh all through the movie.  It is rare that you see the lead character bringing the light/funny moments in a suspense/thriller movie.<br />Christina Ricci likwise played the role quite well.  However, I don't find their teaming up fitting perfectly well, though I can't point out exactly what was wrong in their chemistry.<br />Overall, I recommend viewers to watch the movie.  It's a good movie &amp; not a waste of time at all.
B00004T9UF|3.0|I have such mixed feelings about this disc.  On the one hand, I am all for freedom of expression and the rights of an artist to produce and write anything that he or she wishes.  On the other hand, there comes a point where no amount of fat beats and great ryhming skills can make up for lyrics that lose their meaning after an artist sells millions of records.<br />This is my dilemna with this Eminem/Slim Shady record.  On the one hand, I respect Eminem as an artist and don't think there is anything wrong with white rappers.  I think Eminem truely has some talent and shows some flashes of brilliance.<br />On the other hand, the best spots on this album may not be due to Em at all.  The beats are much smoother than the lyrics on this album.  My favorite vocals on the album are actual contained in the background chorus to &quot;Stan&quot; which are just fantastic (but I understand Slim sampled whoever the woman is who sings here).  &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; has some very witty great rhymes, but it is unfortunate that the whole album isn't more like that.<br />There is a lot of fun on this album.  I think that it appeals to a younger crowd however (I'm 28) and I just can't relate to song after song of Em talking about killing his wife and putting her in the trunk of his car.  I will say that he gets points for originality and doing his own thing and I am not in anyway saying that he should be censored, its just that I would not choose to listen to a majority of this album on a regular basis and so in that way am somewhat dissappointed.  I can listen to the beats and vocals of &quot;Stan&quot; and &quot;The Real Slim Shady,&quot; but that doesn't make for a whole great album.
0684800713|1.0|The only thing that will rise while youre reading this book is boredom. Terrible, infalible boredom. GOsh, what a book !! Absolutely nothing happens, nothing !! They say this is a &quot;Portrait of the lost post-war generation&quot;. POrtrait my a...!! SO, if it is a portrait, I dont care about it, because it is so badly written. THe main female character, BRett, keeps the whole book dancing and flerting and dating the guys. THe guys ( and girls), go into pubs, get out of pubs; then go into hotels, get out of hotels; then take some drinks; then go to sleep with headaches. All this &quot;enchanting&quot; plot is narrated with truculent writing, as if the writer didnt know what he wanted to achieve. Im a big Hemingway fan and I respect his memory, but this book is nothing.
1559409010|5.0|This is quite simply the funniest, most thought provoking and best movie of the entire Monty Python collection.  What other group would give you a movie with political intrigue, religious persecution, Roman Centurions and aliens battling in outer space?  If you like slightly (?) irreverant humor that merciless fun at people's ability to believe in absolutely anything, then this is your movie.  The religious naysayers who pan this movie because they believe it makes fun of Jesus either haven't seen the movie or just weren't paying attention.  This movie gets funnier every time you watch it.  Warning: this movie makes your sides hurt.
6305428220|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE! JOSH HARTNETT IS REALLY REALLY REALLY HOTT TOO!  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT, IT IS THE BEST!
B000000W6F|5.0|Woe for the days when the Smashing Pumpkins were the hottest item on the Chicago club circuit and WXRT was the only radio station in the country playing &quot;Gish.&quot;  That was way back in 1991.  I was mesmorized by this album then, and the feeling has never changed.  As the Pumpkins have exploded into mass popularity, their music has grown more pompous and less interesting.  Not so here.  Listen to the great cuts &quot;Rhinocerous,&quot; &quot;Suffer,&quot; &quot;Tristessa&quot; and &quot;Window Paine&quot; and you'll be hooked.  An excellent low key debut from a band that eventually got too big for their own good.
B000002JS6|5.0|If you don't know much about AC/DC, but you kinda like them, get Back In Black. It is definatly the best AC/DC album by newest lead singer Brian Johnson, it may be the best album by AC/DC. The songs &quot;Back in black&quot;, &quot;Hells bells&quot;, &quot;You shook me all night long&quot;, and &quot;Let me put my love into you&quot; are AWESOME. Of course, every song on the CD is good. So, listen to what I say and buy this album. I also recomend artists like Metallica, Aerosmith, and Ted Nugent. See ya...
0486282112|2.0|Mary Shelley brings up a well argued topic.  Who has the authority to bestow life upon a creature?  That is about the only thing that holds water in the book.  The book starts out boring................ and stays boring.  She wants to write a chilling horror story or a romantic novel, but she only skims the surface.  The only exciting thing about the book that gets you hooked is the vividly designed cover.
0440219078|5.0|This book is often overlooked by adults because of its &quot;young adult&quot; label, which is too bad.  I have never met anyone--adult or child--who has not been moved by this book.  <br />Lois Lowry is a master of storytelling, and this book is no exception.  This is such a departure from her normal style of writing, and it is an absolutely amazing book.  The idea of this &quot;perfect&quot; utopia and the restrictions placed upon its members are fodder for unbelievable conversation.<br />I teach this novel to middle school students, and it never fails to amaze me how they respond to this novel.  I recommend that this book be read and discussed by people of ALL ages.  What a wonderful book for families to read together!<br />(Be sure to check out Lowry's newest book, Gathering Blue, the long-awaited companion to The Giver!)
B00000J631|5.0|This was ingenious. Thirty second (or less) long songs, dumb humor, and, well, punk. All of the songs are really good, seriously, and I don't like bands like Blink 182 or Green Day, but their songs are good. Oh yeah, if this is your first time checking this out, DO NOT BE FOOLED! I have a friend (sort of) who looked at this and said something like &quot;99 songs for 9 Bucks! Awesome!&quot;. These are all really short, but all of them are really amazing songs. Good for skating. <br />My favorite songs are Anchor by Less Than Jake, See Her Pee by NOFX, Don Camero Lost His Mind by Guttermouth, I Like Food by Descendents, and Mr. Brett, Please Put Down Your Gun by H20. Also get some of the Punk O Rama CDs.
B000002LND|5.0|In the 20 years I've listened to music one seldom fines a CD in which all the songs are worth listening to.   Madonna's Immaculate Collection remains one of those rareties. She truly deserved the Award she got for this CD being the best overall collection of songs.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana's fueled grunge thematics are the reason for the rock diversity that we have the pleasure of mandating to personal taste today.  Without question Nevermind is the group's greatest work and this generation's best album.  From the start of Smells Like Teen Spirit to the end of Something In the Way, this album hits and takes no misses.  I never figured out Kurt Cobain's logic in this title, since the term &quot;nevermind&quot; is usually pessimistic and surged by anger, suggesting that the item described is not important.  The title is the antonym of the music, because the album is much depper and enriching with Kurt Cobain's endevorous screaming, sevolistic guitars, the loud punching beat of Dave Ghol's drum set, and the upbeat kick of Chris Novesilic's bass.  The decided ultimatum effect is the promise that Nirvana have never been and never will be music recording sellouts.  The fact that the first 6 songs were all radio hits back in their time, almost 1 decade ago (Smells Like Teen Spirit, In Bloom, Come As You Are, Breed, Lithium, and Polly) automatically ricochets this album out of its class.  At times, the vocals hit like a urning thunder that never reached its potential and is in turn angered in layers by the upset of its lost destiny (Drain You, Territorial Pissings), and at other times (Something In The Way, Come As You Are) there is a soft purge in Kurt's voice that shows a well-vouchered harmony, possibly coming from a man with displeansantries in his environment.  After you give this album a couple of solid listens you'll begin to understand what I'm getting at.  Territorial Pissings, Lounge Act, and On a Plane are the 3 songs besides Spirit that see the album at its blistering rock n' roll nostalgic peak.  In the midst of the 12 song anthem revolution, the grunge diversity of Nirvana adds up to the greatest noteworthy album of the decade and my compact disc collection.  Even if you don't understand a bit of the Nirvana compositions, buy this recordand play along with the anarchy, because grunge won't last forever, and its reign has already died.  Let this be an intensely deserved &quot;grunge splurge&quot; as a reminder that great albums can emerge in spite of their critic ramped genre.  I hope everyone buys this record and enjoys it as much as I have in their own fashoinable way.  I am not using hyperpole when I say that standout groups will have their critic-acclaimed billboard topping releases, but no record not even the finest craft today could come close to challenging the spectacular noise of Nevermind.
B000002P5W|5.0|This is probably the most concise, melodic and straighforward album of Jimi's career. Not a single note is wasted from the feedback drenched opener &quot;E.X.P.&quot;, to the laidback, jazzy groove of &quot;Up From The Skies&quot; and diving right into the slashing power chords of &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; (the REAL birth of heavy metal),Jimi and his classic lineup of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding treat the recording studio itself as an instrument without ever losing their sense of pop song craft and tight band interplay. This is worth owning for the brilliant &quot;Little Wing&quot; and &quot;You Got Me Floatin'&quot; (as well a great album cover), but there is no filler to be found here. A must-have for any serious rock music lover.
B00004T8RK|1.0|One can't argue the fact that Pearl Jam are not a dynamically sound band that overflows with confidence.  When Pearl Jam departed from its grunge sound, the band promised a new and better music layout.  I have yet to see those words made into action.  Binaural is yet another god-awful attempt to salvage Eddie Vedder's reputation for evocative silliness.  I can credit this record for its occasionally bright concoctions, such as Insignificant, Evacuation, and Of the Girl, but that's about as far as the CD goes, in terms of good direction.  Light Years, Typing, and Rival are almost as terrible as the earlier horribly stingy single Yellowledbetter.  Eddie Vedder can sing, and that's good to know, but Binaural's unoriginal, tasteless alternative rock material insures that won't ever matter.  When Pearl Jam graduate to the aptly wonderful sound that they promised fans years ago, knock on my door and I'll give it a listen.  Until then, hit and miss LP's like Binural will continue to flourish in their own scavely scattered rock messes, and will definitely stay out of my CD collection.  It's clear in songs like Nothing As It Seems that the group have an ego to follow and that they believe in their music, which is something great that I couldn't say for some bands nowadays.  However, Vedder and his group need to check the quality of the irritating music that they're so blindly believing in.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna's new CD is unlike any other record she has ever made...it's a creative, interesting new style, and the CD contains many different types of Music. From &quot;Impressive Instant,&quot; which is sure to be a huge club hit, to &quot;I Deserve It,&quot; an amazing ballad in which her voice is raw and unaltered, the CD is great for any occasion, especially when you don't feel like listening to the same type of music for an entire CD.
B00004U3UG|2.0|I must agree with some of the other more negative reviews, this was the first DVD I have bought that truly disappointed me, and I love this movie.  The alternate ending was interesting but why wasn't the original included somewhere?  Also, the quality in some cases is worse than my VHS copy, almost like in order to have continuity with added scenes worse copies of preexisting scenes were used.  Wait, like I should have, for the Special Edition to be re-released.
0767824571|5.0|If you're ever in a sad mood, and want to be cheered up, watch this film.  I have seen it probably 70 times or more, and I still laugh at it every time I see it, even though i can probably recite the entire movie.  I don't see how anyone can rate this movie below five stars, because Monty Python is an institution, the gods of funny, with nobody in existence that could ever match their humor.  This movie is personally my favorite comedy, and even the rudimentary special effects add to the funniness.  And if nobody agrees with what I say, &quot;your mother was a hampster, and you're father smelt of elderberries!&quot;
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has done it again! I would have never thought she could top Ray of Light, but in my opinion she has. I'm glad to see Madonna havning some fun with music again. Don't get me wrong I loved Ray of Light, but Music just seems so much more real to me. Impressive Instant is definitely me favorite track, followed by I Deserve It, and Gone. This album is a must have for everybody. Definitely Madonna's best and most fun work to date. Madonna has truly proven that she is here to stay. Get your copy soon. Heck, why not get two. :)
B00004T9UF|3.0|This CD is so far ahead of the Slim Shady LP that's it not even funny.  However, this CD is.  Eminem took his ability to write very funny songs and rap well to them and brought them out even more.  Criminal is by far one of the funniest songs I've ever heard, and The Real Slim Shady is terrific, mostly due to the amount of humor.  While this is not a great CD by any means and does not constitute anyone calling Eminem a genius, it is still good.  What I Am is the standout track on the CD, mostly because it explains why he does the things he does.  However, it is not a reason to love him.  It is only a reason to nod your head and say, &quot;Yes, I see where you're coming from.&quot;  Stan is also a good track, and the disturbing wife-killing humor is turned down on this LP.  However, the non-disturbing Dr. Dre-killing humor is turned up, and it is quite funny to hear him riff on it.  Once again, Eminem does know how to rap and write humor, but his CD's still need to have more non-generic sounding songs if he wishes to get more fans and another star from this reviewer, but I doubt that I'm up on his list of priorities.  My guess would be, killing Dr. Dre is at number one.
B000002URV|5.0|I never cease to be amazed at how music critics like Steve Gdula(and all art critics, for that matter) seem to believe that their personal tastes dictate whether music is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; for all the rest of us.  <br />In fact, the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; bear no relevance to music.  Oh, sure, there are good performances and bad performances, depending on whether or not the artist achieved what he/she was attempting to play/sing.  But whether a song or album is &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; depends entirely on the taste of the listener.<br />In the case of the first Enigma album, if you personally enjoy mystical multi-layered new age/world arrangements over rhythmic percussion and bass tracks, you'll really enjoy this album (as well as every other Enigma album).<br />If you don't, you won't.
0881032565|5.0|This book was sheer suspense.  It was impossible to put down.  When I realized what a great plot there was, I could not resist.<br />Ten guests are mailed anonymous invitations from one mysterious person to an island.  Little did they know that the host would be a psychotic murderer.  As time passes, the guests learn a little more about themselves and what they did in the past.  Those things in the past, being committed murders!  One by one, the guests are killed off until THERE WERE NONE.  But how is this possble, you wonder...<br />You feel the same intensity as the guests in the story and feel like you're really there.  You can feel the sweat drip off their cheeks as they survey their surroundings in fear.  You can taste their dry mouths as they await to discover who will die next.  The thing that makes this book so exciting is that you are trying to discover who the murderer is, and when you think and know who it is...you're wrong.  In the end, the reader will be left with a jigsaw puzzle and will still not know who the killer is (that's why the epilogue is vital).  <br />I gave this book such a high rating because it was so well written.  It was well written because during the whole scheme of things, you were always having different suspicions and trying to look at it from everybody's point of view.  It's like a Sherlock Homes mystery, except this one is not so easy to solve. The plot is believable and the characters seem real enough to make you thinks it's possible.  But in the end, you wonder how those murders that were committed, were actually possible.
B0000048CX|5.0|&quot;Fakebook&quot; is one of those rare records that you can listen to straight through without skipping tracks. Every song, whether it's the prairie-dust ache of &quot;Can't Forget the Time&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma, USA, or the goofy, rockin' &quot;Emulsified&quot;, this album is gentle, tuneful and resonates with feeling.<br />I know that this is the &quot;commercial&quot; Yo La Tengo album - that it's not as challenging as their other material. Well, if liking well-written songs (I know most of them are covers - but what fabulous choices!), tasteful musicianship, and thoughtfully produced works of art is mainstream, then I guess I'm mainstream!<br />Seriously, the fact that EVERYONE would like this album does not denigrate its quality. If anyone ever asks me for advice about buying CDs, one of the first words out of my mouth is always &quot;Fakebook&quot;! You won't be sorry!!

B00004R99K|5.0|When you review the film remember this:  IT WAS MADE FOR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU THINK.  The movie is a journey inside the brain of a young girl, Alice, and it is therefore a work of the imagination, an escape from reality, and a reminder that a child's imagination must be allowed to grow even as a chld must grow to accept the limitations of reality.  A person without imagination is like a history book without pictures.   For an adult version of &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; see &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;.  There are many similarities between the two movies:  the tunnel, the small door, the problem of being too  big for one's environment, and the eccentric and strange characters.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Although Dracula (1931) is the poorest of the early Universal classics (it's as creaky as a coffin lid compared to the The Mummy, Frankenstein, The Invisible Man, The Bride of Frankenstein, and The Black Cat), this speical edition DVD is the best of the recent releases  of  the Universal Horrors for a number of reasons:<br />1) The Documentary. Skaal goes into great depths on the legend of Dracula and the various incarnations that lead up to the movie that cemented the vampire tale forever into our collective pop culture minds. The interviews with Lugosi's son and people who personally knew Dwight Frye and Hamilton Deane add a touching dimension to the documentary narrative. No other Universal horror documentary quite gets to the bottom of its movie's initial appeal and archival history the way this does.<br />2) Skaal's commentary. Again, insightful, clear, detailed, and willing to criticize the film's many faults without simply harping at it. Skaal obviously loves the film, but knows it is flawed and wants to explain to us how to got that way.<br />3) The music. The new score by Philip Glass (the original release had almost no music at all, typical for early sound) improves the film tremendously. It almost seems like an entirely new movie, fresh and thrilling.<br />4) The Spanish version. Everything you've heard about it is true. It is excitingly directed, filled with innovative camerawork and delightful surprises that explain much of the plot holes in the English version. Some of the performances aren't great (Carlos Villarias doesn't have Lugosi's charisma), but the energy is far greater than Browning's English version. The brief introduction by star Lupita Tovar-Kohner is also interesting and gives viewers a great glimpse into the early days of sound, when rival Spanish productions were common.<br />I can't recommend this DVD enough; it shows that the format can do wonders for archiving old classics and making them live for a new generation. Even when the classic is somewhat . . . creaky.
B00000AF95|3.0|After the successful LICK IT UP tour,it was time to cut Kiss' liabilities;Vinnie Vincent was fired(for the second time)and Mark St John was welcomed on as the new axememan.By 1984,pop metal was a fixture on the charts,so Gene and Paul decided to water down their heavy metal sound for a more friendly MTV-style metal. Although at the time Gene said of St John,&quot;he can make Beethoven sound like the ultimate boogie&quot;;he later complained that Mark was  a speed guitarist in a band of power chord nuts . . .he didn't see to fit with the group.Nevertheless,ANIMALIZE has some KISS KLASSICS:THRILLS IN THE NIGHT continues Paul's sterling run of power ballads;HEAVEN'S ON FIRE was a chart fixture(even here in Australia);LONELY IS THE HUNTER is an overlooked Gene masterpiece;I'VE HAD ENOUGH(INTO THE FIRE)is an bomb blast of an album opener.Unfortunately,Mark does sound like an &quot;angry bee&quot; when he's soloing and the swelling up of his hand before touring behind ANIMALIZE paved the way for Bruce Kulick,thus ending the Mark St John contribution to Kisstory.I firmly believe the watering down of the sound achieved of CREATURES OF THE NIGHT and LICK IT UP only hurt the band in the long run.Though ANIMALIZE was the perfect sound track for American Metal 1984-85 style,it sounds a little dated now(unlike the post HOT IN THE SHADE or pre DYNASTY albums).
B00000K19E|5.0|With thousands of reviews written on THE MATRIX, it seems rather silly to regurgitate what others have already written. Still, I'm compelled to comment on a movie that is slightly left of center. People will claim that this is a good special effects movie, a good action movie, and an excellent commentary on the nature of reality itself. Indeed, Lawrence Fishburne's character Morpheus asks us, &quot;What is real? How do you define real?&quot; And this question is the one that pervades the movie in every sense, starting from a very coherent whole and spinning deeper and deeper until it emerges into a very fresh approach to the &quot;apocalypse&quot; movie theme that was previously dominated by the Terminator movies.<br />I am not personally fond of Keanu Reeves's acting in this movie. He seems detached and emotionless in comparison to his efforts in movies like Point Break and, I'm amazed to say, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure. Carrie Ann Moss seems slightly better in her role as the painfully slim but otherwise fashionably attired Trinity. Her performance at least had more depth than that of Reeves. I personally think that Laurence Fishburne was the best of all the leads, taking his character Morpheus to places emotionally that Reeves hardly touches and Moss approaches, but teeters on the edge of.<br />The movie as a whole intrigued me, then proceeded to fascinate me. The concept, a post-apocalyptic twist with vague associations to the machine wars of &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Terminator II&quot;, was intriguing enough to me that I seriously considered the &quot;what if&quot; idea of a pseudo-reality imposed by computers. It's enough to make your mind boggle if you take it *too* seriously, but I think those are the most enjoyable movies. Just close enough to reality to make you really wonder, and just far enough out of touch with reality to make the movie enjoyable, fresh, and watchable again and again.<br />Now about the action...the fight scenes are great. Watching the &quot;Follow the White Rabbit&quot; cuts interspersed on the DVD and watching the &quot;making of&quot; information available really rounds out the value of this movie purchase for me. It's  stunning to watch the training and the technology of movie making meld together to make a final scene that pushes the bounds of physical reality just enought that you think &quot;Damn! I wish I could do that myself!&quot; In my house, when a group of friends come over and discuss martial arts, THE MATRIX inevitably ends up in the DVD player as a visual aid to the discussion.<br />Would I rescue the DVD from a fire? Probably so. Would I buy a copy for a friend who didn't have one? Absolutely. Would I see it again if they re-released it in the theatres? Without a doubt.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|In the movie business, a sleeper refers to a film that is not well known, but turns out to be a great film to see.  The story talks about relationships in the family.  It is so uplifting to see the desire to become close again after a rift has occurred in the family.  I loved watching the main character drive the lawn mower because I tried to picture myself doing that, and I don't think I'd be quite as brave. But he was determined to see his brother, and he did whatever he had to do to make it happen.  My husband refuses to go to movies because he said he doesn't need to pay to fall asleep.  We decided, however, to go with friends to see this incredible movie. I was touched to see my husband not only stay awake, but have tears in his eyes.  It is my husband's favorite movie. I recommend it wholeheartedly.  It'll make you feel good.
B00004X01U|2.0|I bought Madonna's latest today and listened to it through headphones at work.  All the beeping and chirping and cheesy voice effects gave me a headache.  Maybe I just need to let it sink in after a few more listens.  But I couldn't even pick out a logical follow-up single to &quot;Music&quot;.  Nothing grabbed me as being the next big hit off this album. <br />I still giver her credit though for the longevity of her career.  But at this point in time, the last thing she should be doing is sounding like a tired Cher song.
B00004X01U|4.0|If you know Madonna well, the entire cowgirl theme should be understandable. It is just the result of her search for a different look that appears on each album. I would have to agree that Music is a toss of different beats and electronic sounds that don't express much order, form and genuine personality as its predecessor. It's as though madonna decided to throw something together overnight slap a picture on it, and call it an album, and though it may be an album, I do not see it giving Ray Of Light a run for its money being that it does not give fans an example of who she is at this moment. While some songs like &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, and &quot;Gone&quot; do justify the cowboy hat, songs like &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; are poison in her expression. I felt this way when Ray Of Light was released. Maybe it just needs some getting used to.
B000002KIT|5.0|sound, agression wildness, taste, feelings, charisma lyrics, this is the ultimate livealbum. I rank Philip Lynott on the same level as Shakespeare, DeFoe! Philip was a poet, a singer, a rocker and  there will be only one man like Phil Lynott in our lifetime! Thank´s for your time folks!<br />Se ya!
B00004X01U|5.0|Before I gave this album only 4 stars. I now understand what madonna's focus is on this time. If you dont get it, listen more carefully or look on the website for the lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, they could have been, and should have been put in the album. I would have to say that the music is no longer my infirmity - I now love it, but the question still in my mind is: What's the deal with album booklet? I understand the deal with the cowgirl image, but maybe she just needs to come out, publicize it, and explain what it's all about. The music's great! All that's left is relating her current image with her current music.
B00004SVIK|5.0|What else do us die hard Pink Floyd fans expect?  Everything Gilmour, Mason, and Wright is stunning.  Ive never been dissapointed of any Floyd album, but this one is the epitimy of great.  I was only 2 years old when they perofrmed the Wall at Earls Court, I wish I were born 20 years before I was just so I could have been a part of that show, but this album is the next best thing to actually being there.  &quot;Run like Hell&quot; blew me away the way Roger Waters started out by saying &quot;Are their any Paranoids in the audience tonight&quot;, Waters was a true showman, thats for sure.  Gilmour's guitar solo on top of the wall made the hair on my arms stand up during &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, what a true talent he is.  I'm really excited for the next Floyd album, I'm sure Dave, Nick, and Rick are working on it as I speak, but for now-------SHINE ON
B00004X01U|5.0|It's nice to see someone who knows they could put out records based on successful formulas of the past, but instead chooses to push themselves to attempt new things.  It's also nice to see her use herself as a conduit between niche musical genres/producers and the mainstream music world.  This is by far her most interesting work yet.  Someone mentioned there's a lot of techno on here... I'm hearing only three tracks of dance.  There's some rock (Amazing), trip-hop (Nobody's Perfect and Paradise), and some mid- to slow-tempo pop fare (What it feels like, etc.).  It's just a great, mature, interesting album.  I look forward to her future releases now much more than I did before, and that's saying something for someone who doesn't consider himself a big Madonna fan.
0440234743|2.0|The idea is an intriguing one. Multi-billionaire Troy Phelan is old and lonely. He built his fortune while neglecting his wives and children. Now, losers all, they are just waiting for him to die so they can divide the money. He has one last surprise in store for them, however. A surprise will leaves everything to an unknown, illegitimate child who lives as a missionary in Brazil. The legal maneuvering as Phelan's lawyer battles the family over the estate is entertaining and satisfying. It's difficult to feel much sympathy for this bunch and their conniving lawyers are even worse.<br />Other aspects of this tale are less satisfactory. The selfless missionary, Rachel, lives in the Pantanal while pursuing her desire to foist her religious convictions off on a bunch of stone age natives. The lawyer sent to find her, Nate, is a weak personality. He, too, has devoted his life to his career while neglecting wives and children. He is also attempting his fourth recovery from binges on drugs and alcohol. Poor Nate! He's stuck in the same rat race as all the rest of us, but he just can't cope.<br />Nate finds Rachel in the Pantanal. The Pantanal is not the Amazon rainforest. It is a huge, swampy area located further south. If you are expecting a jungle adventure, you are in for a disappointment. The journey has its difficulties, but they have more to do with storms and mosquitos than hostile natives and dangerous carnivores. I really didn't find it all that harrowing.<br />Nate is taken with the relaxed pace of life and the natural beauty surrounding him. Who wouldn't be. On the other hand, these laid back people live in sqaulid, miserable conditions. The life is only idyllic as long as you don't get bitten by a poisonous snake or become sick and find yourself in the local hospital. Then it's pretty awful.<br />Nate drifts along, does what he has to, and ultimately comes out smelling like a rose, just as Rachel assures him he will if he just trusts in God. How nice. Pretty hard to swallow, though. If you or I just sat around and waited for everything to come out the way we want, we would end up as homeless people.<br />Grisham is a competant writer, and he does his usual capable job of developing his plot. At times, though, this story is just weak. Rachel, predictably, doesn't want the fortune. She can't even get enough money to buy the drugs she needs to treat the natives, but fails to see the advantages of her good fortune. Understadably, she wants to avoid the complications, but, for someone who really wanted to help people, it wouldn't be hard to find a way around the difficulties.<br />I have read several of Grisham's other books. I have generally found them interesting and fast-paced. This one was often slow, the characters silly, the outcome obvious and too easy.rd to swallow, though.

B000002JR8|5.0|This CD is so good. I had to beg my friend Dave to give it to me. This guy named Nick nearly hurt some kid for dropping my CD on the ground (luckily it landed label-down and didn't get scratched.) My fave song is Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills. Definitely not clean but very cool. Everyone that doesn't have this CD should go buy it right now!!!! Go on, do it!
0446608955|5.0|Buy it. Enjoy it. Share it. Sure you know what's going to happen but unless you're reading a mystery, you usually do have an idea of the ending. It's sweet, nostalgic, sentimental and worth a couple of hours of your time. Hope you get as much out of it as I did. Take care.
0486282112|1.0|This is one book that you shouldn't even spend the light of day to even read. The reason towards this is because it was dull boring and put me to sleep. I had to read this for school and didn't think the beginng was so bad but then I hit the bad spot it was the worse thing I ever read. It has its good points but few of them. Just don't waste your time on this.

0060977264|3.0|Paulo Coelho really takes us over his different moods and aspects of writing. This in fact to be very honest is no way compared to his best, &quot;Alchemist&quot; but yes, it definitely holds a good place in my book shelf.<br />It is a story about a woman who comes over to see her old childhood friend and then is carried by the life and the mysterious moves of spirituality. She could have hardly imagined that she is falling in love with her childhood friend. Initially she does not even believe that she can ever fall in love with her friend but then finally, unconsciously, but very fervently she does falls in love with him.<br />The story moves so closely with all the ins and outs of the life and yet keeps us abreast of the reality and originality, which Paulo Coelho holds in his mind for the book. Her friend who is now a spiritual follower and works to serve other people, though definitely loves her - but that is not what his final destination was? Those were not the commitments he made with life? Apart from all that, he still loves her.<br />Pilar (the central character - &quot;The Woman&quot;) is now in the dilemma, which is encircling her every moment. She does not know how to approach him, she does not know whether he will say yes or not. She does not know whether even if says yes will he be able to forget his old passion and love her fully, she does not know whether taking her would be the right choice for the man she loved or not. Now to unravel the story, all you have to do is read this book.<br />As far as my comments go, I found this book interesting. Dealing very closely with our thoughts, confusions, dilemmas, mysteries, spirituality, and the decision making.<br />Happy Reading!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|WOw! The strongest Maiden album ever, I might add... In some tunes there's a scaring resemblance to Deep Purple, and I guess Dickinson's voice sometimes sounds a lot like Ian Gillan's... Well, those two bands are quite fond of each other and the music they play circles in the same hemisphere, so nothing amazing. The classic Maiden lineup is back with a great work!
B0000039LE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite horror movies. This is a story of a young child who kills his sister and her boyfriend.He is put into an institution and is about to be released. A doctor (well played by Donald Pleasance) rushes to the institution to stop the release of Michael Myers. The doctor is too late and the monster is loose. Myers returns to his hometown on Halloween. A group of teenagers fall victim to him one by one. One of the children who is being babysat tabs Myers the &quot;Boogie Man&quot;. After killing off the teenagers there is a final confrontation between Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis. Myers is stabbed by Curtis but rises from the dead. In the meantime the Doctor discovers where Myers is. The doctor shoots Michael Myers with a high caliber pistol anf blows him off of the balcony. The young boy asks the Doctor if Myers is the &quot;Boogie Man&quot;. The Doctor says that yes Myers is the &quot;Boogie Man&quot;. The young boy replies that you Can't kill the &quot;Boogie Man&quot;. The Doctor looks over the balcony and Michael Myers is gone. This has to be one of the scariest endings to a  movie that I have ever see. Be sure to see this movie,it is indeed a classic.
B000006045|5.0|I've had this album for a year now, and I don't think I have ever once listened to it without finding something new, some new interface of sounds or little detail that makes this stand out as one of the best albums of any kind in quite a while.  To say that its the best &quot;trip-hop&quot; or like Tricky but louder, or whatever most people have said about Mezzanine, is to limit its impact.  This album is truly unique in that it doesn't stick to one style or one kind of beat or one guitar technique, but rather seems to sound, at any given moment, exactly how it SHOULD sound, getting the feelings and atmosphere across without being clouded with a defineable style or &quot;trick.&quot; If you have ever thougt that Massive Attack was &quot;just&quot; a trip-hop group, or &quot;just&quot; anything else, listen to Mezzanine with open ears; you'll be surprised.
B000002GYI|5.0|Kraftwerk is often viewed as being cold and inhuman. Yes, there musical approaching is just that, their sound lacks an \\"organic\\" feel, I'm not denying that. But as far as their perspective of technology goes, at the heart is a very human substance. <br />Released in 1981, Computer World predates the internet exploding into the mainstream. But even still it is very precise in showing what humanity has become in the face of technology and progress. Obsessed, consumed, out of touch with ourselves. Computer Love may not be about \\"one handed exercises\\", but still the loneliness that pervades the modern world is definitely there. And in light of online relationships, net addiction, net stockings and all that other good antisocial stuff, I wonder what sort of album would have been created if they were working on Computer World today. Honestly, I can't see it coming out that much different.<br />Or perhaps I'm just reading too much into it. Either way, the music is great. Refined, it as a shiny metal(I don't mean hard rock) sound that doesn't leave you choking on plastic like a lot of modern electronic music does.
0486282112|3.0|This was an excellent read with a twisting and turning plot. That made you afradi of the dark at night and found yourself looking behind your back during the day. But Mary Shelley tended to drone and she tended to turn an excellent plot into a boring one. This novel does teach you valuable lessons about life and human nature, that are fascinating and intriuging. Overall this was a good book that would have been better with a more experienced author and less complicated writing.
B00004X01U|5.0|I love this album.  I just got it and I love it.  Sometimes you have to listen an entire CD to really like it, or sometimes an album only has one good song, well NOT THIS ONE.  Madonna is finally coming back with excellent beats.  This album makes me wanna DANCE!  It's awesome.
B00001NFCY|1.0|it's surprising and depressing that so many of the prior reviewers of this album rate it so highly.  i listened to this album at a used cd store and am grateful i did so because it saved me from wasting my money.  the sanctimonious posturing, both physically and lyrically, of their lead singer is so contrived and comical that i think them to be another in a long and boring line of those who so completely lack their own originality that they must copy those who came before- those who, incidentally, did a much better job at creating worthwhile music.  i would only recommend this to someone i disliked intensely.
0375703764|5.0|Well, hrm.  I found this book to be an amazing work.  I first read it online, in its entirety, and after finishing ran out and bought a copy.  I feel like I wasn't done with it after finishing the last page.  I think that was intended.  It is one of the few books that may truly be worth re-reading.  Don't look at it as a book, but as a surealist painting.
630441403X|5.0|This movie tells it like it is to be an alcoholic in sin city. Mr Cage plays this part to perfection. Not one of those movies where you say to yourself, This only happens in the movies. If you really want to see what its like to be a true down and out drunk in Las vegas then buy this movies. You will watch it more then once.
6300182266|5.0|I loved the movie,I loved the series and I loved the books.I just wish it would have gone on for a few more seasons.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Just a word: Greatness.  There a scene where the emperor wonders what was so great about a battle that's going to be recreated in the arena for his entertaintment, what's so great about these gladiators.  Never before have I seen the meaning of the word to graphically displayed, leaving all without doubt.  When in its presence, no explanations are required.  That is greatness.  Enjoy!  I can't wait for my DVD!
B00004T1NA|5.0|We can only hope that for the sake of the the band, we can tell the world &quot;I told you about Porcupine Tree years ago.&quot;  Every one of his/thier albums is familiar, but also fresh, and undeniably brilliant.  Wilson and crew, on this newest release, fuse excellent songwriting (a trend alluded to on Stupid Dream)  with great production and fantastic playing.  PT can capture an emotion or mood with ridiculous ease.  The very first note of &quot;So Low&quot; gives me a sensation of isolation and derpression, and &quot;Four Chords...&quot; gives me a very vivid mental picture of SW flipping off a record exec.  Many reviewers think that this release lacks the atmosphereic depth of previous releases, but I would like to offer the opinion that the atmosphere is just a little different on LS.  It is most certainly not ignored.  If I really want to nitpick, there are a few slightly cliche'd moments in the first song, and they are only painful because they are so up front.  If this song was later on the CD, it would not be noticable at all.  Bottom line: If you want a place to start, Stupid Dream (a basically perfect album), and then this one, then try to catch The Sky Moves Sideways (another basically perfect but outdated by PT standards) if you can.
B00004X01U|5.0|Britney Spears may be one of New York's all time singers but, Madonna  is  better then Britney. Infact, Britney Spears thinks she so cool and thinks she could just beat everyone in music. But guess what? THAT'S NOT TRUE!! Madonna is really the best singer and even more talented then Britney! Madonna has a more deep-and down-under voice that really means something. For example: &quot;Music&quot; is really something to sing about because it really means something; Music.
0790749998|5.0|God I love this movie!! It's so good, really exciting, with a lot of action and the best actors.When I heard that Jet Li and Aliyah were starring in that movie, I said &quot;I have to go and see that movie!&quot; I never thought that Jet Li and Aliyah would work that good together.<br />I think that it was really good that Jet Li defended his family and Aliyah's family even though they were different races. I liked the part whenever Jet Li used Aliyah's arms and legs as weapons, to hit a girl. Remember &quot;I can't hit a girl.&quot; Now that part was really funny. This movie is a great movie, if you have not seen it you really need to go and check it out.
B00004KD1L|5.0|...after an after hours party.  to call it an utterly transporting experience would be accurate.  what struck me as particularly stunning was the variation of tracks...from the mantras to the dance grooves.  i have been in to this genre for about 2 years starting with K&amp;D.  this stands up there with DJ Kicks and Mo' Horizons as aural creamery butter (with flecks)
B00004X01U|1.0|It is truly a misnomer to have titled this album &quot;MUSIC&quot; when in fact it doesn't contain any, or if there is it is kept well hidden. Once again Madonna proves beyond a doubt that attitude and controversy are no substitute for the real thing(Talent). The backgrounds are so fabricated and overproduced that it's  hard to tell sometimes what you're listening too. If you're a fan of her earlier stuff, I would recommmend sticking to it. Afterall when it was first released it was just junk, now however it has become vintage junk!
0060930349|3.0|I admire Paul Johnson's unabashedly biased approach to his discussion of the drivers of American history. There is no reason why historians must limit themselves to mere description stripped of analysis. Such analysis shines through in the early chapters and up to the events of the Civil War. <br />But starting with the late 19th Century, the book begins to lose its edge, and at times it seems that even the author is bored. But more than that, he loses his historian's sense of balance of major personalities as we enter the 20th Century. Whereas, for instance, Johnson intriguingly explores the brilliance and shortcomings of Jefferson, building a complete picture of the man, we are treated to only half of the picture by the time we reach the 20th Century's presidents. The only democrat who is spared is Truman, and rightly so. I certainly agree that Kennedy was far less the man than the one painted in our popular culture,  but Johnson's attacks on Kennedy for expanding US involvement in Vietnam leaves Eisenhower (who initiated US involvement) curiously uncriticized. <br />Conversely, Nixon is treated as almost saintly. True, we should give credit to his geostrategic vision, but a reasoned analysis of his pushing the envelope of presidential authority would have been of more use to the reader. To this end, an important thread not wholly explored but culminating in Nixon's unprecedented use of presidential authority, is an exposition on why power in the 20th Century was being increasingly abrogated by congress into the President's hands.  <br />Instead, for example, we are told that the Reagan Administration was morally no worse than any other administration in circumventing the Constitution in pursuit of covert foreign activity. There is much to praise Reagan for, yet Johnson spends far more time describing Reagan's sense of humor than on taking him to task for letting the deficit explode during his tenure, or explaining his role in Iran Contra. <br />Bush is treated with near derision for not marching into Baghdad (even though his Arab allies threatened to break up the coalition if he did so, a point not mentioned by Johnson). Yet little is said of Bush's management of his administration's reaction to the collapse of the Soviet empire and talk of the expansion of NATO. Bill Clinton is derided for being a sleaze almost as surely as Kennedy was. True, but even with little to show for his foreign policy record even now, Clinton's support of an expanded role for NATO, his support for Most Favored Nation Status for China, or his signing of NAFTA, is not mentioned at all. Ultimately, my feeling is that if, say, NAFTA were signed into law by a Republican, Johnson would have spent as many pages on that momentous event as he did on Reagan's joketelling.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie was a brillinat work of masterpiece from unknwons: The Wayans Brothers, who are the Farrelly brothers but grosser. Many unknowns who now have a huge career ahead of them (including SNL's Cheri Oteri) have joined in to make the farce of the century. This movie is also a major groos out comedy, which is breaking boreders and pushing the limit a little further out! Shannon Elizabeth (American Pie alumni) is also along for the hillarious ride!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|this movie i thought was the funniest movie ever. There is nothing funnier honestly i have seen it 4 times at the movies it is full of nasty jokes though not a family movie but im only 14. And loved it like the part when a weine goes through the ear of a guy. see but i laughed so much i almost chocked but this dvd is awsome x10 its the BOMB. the movie was hilarious but warning  if you have asma make sure your inhalor is in your poket and enjoy the show. by kory davis
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Every now and then you listen to a song that makes every hair on your arm stand on end.   This is the case with almost every song on ATDI's new release &quot;Relationship of Command&quot;.  This hardworking band has received much critical acclaim recently and deservedly so.  This is passionate music that demands your attention from the get go and doesn't let up until the last cut. Aggressive yet filled with passionate hooks and underlying melodicism within its blitzkrieg arsenal of sound.     I heard this is one of the best live bands around and I can definitely see why.  I'm sure this album captures the raw intensity of the band's live show.  Very strong songwriting with a bold emotional assault on the senses makes &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; one of the best releases of 2000 and a force to listened to repeatedly to fully understand.  Essential.
B000000SHJ|5.0|The Vermeer Quartet's 9 CD collection is also available as 3 separate volumes of 3 CDs each. This collection is priced about one third less than the combined cost of the three individual albums, making it not just a fine recording, but a great value as well.<br />The Vermeer Quartet is fantastic, and although the competition in these works is formidable, the Vermeer holds its own in comparisons to the others. The early and middle quartets are beautifully played, and the contrasting playful and dramatic moods are well stated. <br />It is with the late quartets that this recording really distances itself from most of the other versions. The late quartets are perhaps the highest level of creativity Beethoven achieved. These unconventional works, when in the hands of less gifted players, often fall flat or leave the listener befuddled. Here, the Vermeer leave the listener in awe, not with their own virtuosity, but with Beethoven's profound genius. <br />If you love Beethoven, and you do not already own another version of these quartets, do not hesitate to purchase this.
6305428425|5.0|This film is fabulous... not just because Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino are faultlessly funny as dippy Romy and Michele... or the 80s-tastic soundtrack... or the scene that I almost blacked out while laughing at (but can't tell you because I'll ruin it for you... but just remember to always look BOTH ways before crossing the street)... or the fact that you can't fail to find this trip (...well, more of a flying leap) down memory lane hilarious, cynical and touching at times... Alright, okay, I admit it, these are exactly just some of the reasons why you NEED to see this film !! Just buy this DVD so you can see get into the groove and be footloose with these good time gals. Plus, this movie is essential viewing for anyone who has ever been involved in a contemporary dance class... you will wet yourself... trust me !!
079073382X|3.0|This film, like clowns, makes me both happy and afraid of humanity.  I fear this movie like an aspiring Worlds Smallest Midgit who finds his twin in a vacent mall parking lot and has to come to grips with the fact that he is not the only one who is him.  I am &quot;Jesse&quot;, and his story and everthing is me.  I love this movie as I love myself and Parisian women.  I write this so that you may read it and want to watch that movie at  4 o'clock in the morning so that Before Sunrise you shall know me.
B00003CXCS|3.0|This is such a wonderful movie and I was so very disappointed that the DVD picture quality was not better.  I found myself squinting my eyes throughout the movie to try to get it into focus, but it did not work. I would like to see the original again on the big screen to have something to compare to the DVD. The Sound quality was OK, no complaints there.
B00001ODHF|5.0|Even though the second one was funny and the first one was the origanal, this one is the best Evil Dead of them all. He goes back to the renisance. Remember when he cut off his hand in the first one, he uses a chainsaw at first but then gets a steel hand in this one. It was tyt when the battle with the people vs the dead who took over their land happened. That had to be the best battle I've seen in my life. And one of my favorite lines was from a skeleton warrior when the general said &quot;Retreat, Retreat!&quot;  &quot;Lets get the hell out of here, ya,&quot; which he said in a little girlish voice. When he said that I was lauin' so hard. Its one of those movies that is one of the best sequels. As far as an Evil Dead movie goes, this is the best one of them all. And you don't have to see 1 or 2 to see this one cuz it has a recap of the first to movies in the beginning.
0486282112|2.0|the book explains the story in such a slow way it makes the reader go to sleep while reading!  i didn't believe that was possible until i read the book. it is so difficult to understand. the theme is good but it has bad wording. the creature starts out knowing no english. all the sudden he knows big words that english scholars can't even understand. this book puts the &quot;BAD&quot; in &quot;horrible&quot;. i know that doesn't makes sense but neither does the book.

0783242808|3.0|If you are a person easily offended by a film dedicated primarily to the glory of teen sex, you may well view &quot;American Pie&quot; as yet another in a long line of cinematic harbingers of the collapse of western civilization. If, however, you remember adolescence as essentially a period of unending coitus interruptus, you may well find yourself engrossed by this amusing, though admittedly crude, series of sexual and scatalogical gags woven around a plot involving the desperate attempts of a quartet of last semester seniors to lose their virginity on the fast approaching sexual armageddon known as &quot;prom night.&quot;<br />&quot;American Pie&quot; gleans most of its comic energy from its outrageous examination of the crazy and innovative extremes desperately horny teens will go to in order to experience the thrill of sex in lieu of the real thing. An attractive, game cast helps to mitigate the crudity of many of their actions and the filmmakers' lighthearted tone encompasses the characters in such a cloak of affection that the audience identifies with, rather than condemns, their antics.<br />As meager compensation for the moralists among us, the film does heavily promote the use of condoms and comes up with even more creative prophylactics for those times when a partner is not available.<br />&quot;American Pie&quot; is certainly not for every taste and there are those who would argue that it serves a less than salutary purpose as a guide for already sex-obsessed teenagers. Be that as it may, the film provides a fair number of hearty chuckles for those of us who can find humor in a group of backward youngsters experiencing the frustration and desperation we have all, at one time, experienced.<br />I do have one troubling question though: why do none of these characters, whenever they are involved in a potentially compromising position, ever lock a door? The answer, I suppose, is obvious for, if they did, at least half the film's biggest laughs would become impossible to achieve. For this film, at least, such a suspension of disbelief may be a prerequisite.<br />Be forewarned but enjoy!possible to achieve.

0486282112|4.0|We rate this book four star for a few reasons,which apply to how we understood the context of the story.<br />  The book gives you a good understanding of the emotions of the creature named Frankenstein.  It brings you in to all the  pain and misery that the creature suffered ever since he was created by Victor Frankenstein.  This is a book that will affect your outlook on life and how you treat other people.  It shows examples of many emotions such as curiousity, love, kindness, and revenge.  We discovered the fatal mistakes of Victor Frankenstein, when he created his monster through the blindness of ambition.  Though the story was of course at times suspenseful and violent, it is also a romantic love story between Victor and his adopted sister Elizabeth.
0783225970|5.0|Call me crazy, but watching this movie is part of my weekly agenda no matter what happens. Pacino plays Tony Montana, a cuban who comes to America as part of the crime wave. He wants to make it big asap. Some of the scenes such as the one with the chain saw are gruesome but definitely worth watching. I can never get bored of it. This is definitely one to own.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna never gets old. Coming out with up-to-date electronic pop now more than ever is her newest release \\"Music,\\" following its previous and more daring predecessor, \\"Ray of Light.\\" Again, William Orbit gives us his keyboards, guitars, and backing vocals in two fun, dance, booty-movin' tracks. But this time, Madonna goes Parisian with Mirwais Ahmadzai for the majority of the producing.   Madonna's lyrics have definitely matured from her \\"Material Girl\\" ages. In the song, \\"I deserve It,\\" she sings, \\"Many miles, many roads I have traveled, fallen down on the way...\\" In this CD, she really brings herself out by telling of her past experiences and sings from her inner soul. From her past recent albums and now this, one can tell that she's trying to connect with her spiritual-being through her music.   If you like to dance, this is definitely the album for you. Filled with fast-paced moves, it also has the sought after medium dance beats from \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl,\\" and \\"Paradise.\\" An artistically brilliant and \\"Amazing,\\" is Madonna's greatest dance song. It will get you stepping contagiously with it from beginning to end. \\"Music,\\" currently on the top 40 pop charts, is the song to sing and dance to. With easy-to-remember lyrics such as, \\"Hey Mister DJ, put a record on...I wanna dance with my baby...\\" it can really get a party started.
0486282112|1.0|This book had a really good idea for a story. Too bad she couldn't describe feelings to save her life. Its amazing that in less than a year, a monster, made from dead criminals can learn to speak better than i have been able to in my entire life. By the way? Where did he get the pieces of dead people? Yeah, he just walked in the local morgue and picked up the pieces he needed. Sure. Well if you have any thing that you need to get done DO IT BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK. I didn't think anyone could make a 160 page book seem so long! And talk about repetative. Well I think I made my point.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Do you have the need for speed? 0 - 60 in 2.9 Seconds sound good? The cast of this movie couldn't have been chosen any better.  Nicholas Cage is great in this movie just like he was in movies like 'The Rock' or 'Con Air'. I personally didn't like some of his new ones like 'Bringing out the Dead' but I saw this one anyway because I am a fast car fanatic.  It combines NON-STOP action and suspense with drama and comedy.  A killer combo. This movie is DEFINATELY worth seeing for anyone who likes Nicholas Cage or anyone who has been convicted for grand theft auto.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is one of the best records I have heard. I mean he this guy has some talent and he is expressing his feelings by singing instead of going out there and killing people. His words express how he grew up in the world. It must have been hard growing up for Slim Shady. I just want to say I can't wait for the other CD to come out. Keep it up Slim, don't let anybody put you down. Look at you now, keep rising to the top. Peace
0486282112|4.0|Mary Shelley did a phenominal job with this book.  The fact that it was only meant as a time-passer adds to the books power.  The story is very well defined, and there are no hard places to follow.  There are however, a few places that could be cut with no harm being done to the novel.  That is to be expected with every book though.  The true feelings of all of the characters can be felt throughout.  Most everyone thinks of the monster as being just that, a terrible, hideous monster.  That isn't the way Mary Shelley meant for him to be veiwed as though.  His feelings can be felt, and they are profound.  Shelley's Frankenstein is a great book.  READ IT!
B00004RF98|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is justifiably acknowledged to be one of the greatest musicals ever made. There's little to add to the highly-deserved praise contained in the other comments posted here. I would, however, like to draw attention to a beautiful little song in this movie that is generally overlooked: &quot;Would You.&quot; It's a shame that this wonderful little song has never established a place of its own outside this delightful movie. But, hey, if you're going to get lost, this movie is a wonderful place to do so.
0671027344|5.0|This book hit home. I was never a complete nerd, I had my close set of friends, but was never a jock, or one the coolest kids in class. Much like our &quot;hero&quot; Charlie, I discovered things at a slow pace, enjoyed high school, but think back that it could've been better. This book took me back to high school (even though I just graduated in 95) and I loved the ride man. All the while I read this book I pictured myself trudging down my high school halls, being late for class, hang out during lunch... Just a fantastic book, triggers a good walk down memory lane. Read it and enjoy.
B00004U5SC|5.0|Shane is THE classic western. The plot is simple but classic: A gunfighter trying to escape his past must fight again to save homesteaders from a ruthless cattle baron and his hired killer (well played by Jack Palance). Alan Ladd rises above his normal roles and convincingly plays Shane as a reluctant but implacable hero. The cast as a whole is strong, and Ben Johnson stands out as a ranch hand who taunts and fights Shane at first but eventually warns him of the impending trap which leads to the film's dramatic climax. The background scenery is gorgeous as is Victor Young's film score. Shane is a great movie, not just a great western.
B000002J6F|5.0|The thing about Stills, in my view, is that in CSN&amp;Y he was noted more for his voice. This CD proves that he was one of the best guitarists in rock; that his concept of rhythm and blues and vocal stylings were unmatched. This album was recorded right after the CSN&amp;Y height, and you can tell that he was at his critical peak. That super group didn't allow him to voice all his material. This album does. Tremendous pacing; great segues. The work here hits a pitch and keeps it for 18 out of the 21 songs. No album in my mind has such depth in its quality. There are more solid songs here than the last five CSN albums combined. &quot;Bound To Lose,&quot; &quot;Jet Set,&quot; &quot;It Doesn't Matter&quot; -- these are songs that most avid CSN fans don't even know about, and yet they are better than anything save for &quot;49 Bye Byes&quot; on the first CSN album. There is one drawback to this album -- there are three real country tunes here that really sound out of place. I have to program my CD player to excise them; other than that I put this CD on and let it go all day. Thank God someone at Atlantic finally got smart and re-mastered this classic. I've been looking for this one for about 15 years.

B00004Y6TQ|4.0|I just bought this CD and finished my first listen to it. It wasn't bad... however, it was unlike anything I have heard from Bjork before. In fact, if this album were not by Bjork, I would have had no inclination to buy it, because the style of music is not a style that I am particularly fond of.<br />Unlike the reviewer before me, I can't see how this CD is revolutionary in any way. The songs are beautiful, but not extraordinary.<br />I guess I just prefer a light hearted and yet intense, trippy Bjork. This music is a little too &quot;epic&quot; feeling and mellow for my tastes. However, with Bjork's beautiful voice, even an album of nursery rhymes would receive four stars from me.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I'm amazed for two reasons.  Number one because Magnolia is the most innovative, fun, crazy, emotional, heroic movie I've ever seen.  The characters become real almost instantly.  There are so many strong fundamentally raw human themes running through the movie that are captured so poignantly that all I can do is let my jaw drop. The second reason I'm amazed is because of all the people who can't see this.  First of all, the length is totally a non-issue.  Not only was I upset when it ended, but I found myself watching this film three times over again within a 48 hour period.  Only boring people get bored.  This film was woven with such complicated genius that I believe I could watch it again and again, and not only never become bored, but continue to make exciting discoveries.
B00004UEI7|5.0|Sonny was in his absolute prime when he cut Way Out West. No tennor ever had a better tone than &quot;Newk&quot;, and that includes some very exclusive company, (Clotrane, Getz, Shorter, etc.) The painstaking remastering job here brings out the brillance of his majestic sound. To me Sonny's pharsing has always had the same inherent rhythem as the great post-war singers like Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Without a single bad note or overstated pharse, Way Out West is some of the best hard-bop you'll ever hear. Fortunately Sonny is still going strong and at seventy-something he is still producing vital music for us to enjoy.

6304458304|5.0|In the Line of Fire was definitely in the top 10 of suspense/drama films in the 1990's. I was not a big Clint Eastwood fan but he gives a great performance as an old time Secret Service agent. The movie links his &quot;involvement&quot; in the Kennedy assassination to a current potential assassin. That potential assassin is played exquisitely by John Malkovich. At first, we know him as John Wilkes Boothe (another assassin) but as the movie progresses, we come to learn more about &quot;Boothe&quot;, his real name, his multiple homes, and his violent past as a ........just watch. The movie is basically a cat and mouse but to the highest degree. Rene Russo, a fellow agent, has good chemistry with Eastwood as they desparately try to locate Malkovich before another U.S. President is assassinated under Eastwood's guard. What Eastwood doesnt know is how vulnerable he is on a daily basis when he is eerily stalked by Malkovich. It all makes for great suspense and fun for a couple hours.
B00003XB8K|3.0|First off, this album has its high points and low points.  And each time it ascends (or descends) to one of those, it goes farther than it ever has before.  Case in point, the 2-track opening salvo of &quot;The Gate&quot; and &quot;Push The Limits&quot; is a magnificent piece.  The Gate softly introduces you to the world that exists on this album, and seamlessly folds into &quot;Push The Limits&quot; which surges out from the background to take you along for the ride.  And then the ride these 2 songs have taken you on hits some major turbulence with absolute clunkers like &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; (which has decent music, but with Michael Cretu's lackluster vocals, the song's quality takes a nosedive).   The other gems are &quot;Gravity of Love&quot;, the title track, and &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot;.....the others fit the categories I listed above, with no middle ground to be found.  As a whole, this album is good, but it could have been far better.
B000002H33|5.0|This album is easily 5 stars. All 8 songs are amazing, great lyrics,great everything. There is nothing weak about Master Of Puppets. It's just non stop heavy metal at it's finest. Fast and Heavy, great song writing.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of the best movies Ive seen.  Yes, there is quite a bit of violence but the story and the acting was incredible!   I cant wait to get this movie on DVD!
B00000K2UX|5.0|This CD is one of the greats because it has all the classic songs on it by artists like kenny loggins and cheaptrick. I particularly good soundtrack and a must have for 80's music fans.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This film is probably one of the warmest and heartbreaking films of the year and it is all because of David Lynch and Richard Farnsworth. Unlike your typical Hollywood movie, David Lynch is able to work in the multitude of charachters in &quot;The Straight Story&quot; in a very natural and unpretentious way. The beauty of the picture is the way in which Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) is able to touch all the people he meets as he travels from Iowa to Wisconsin on his tractor to meet his ailing brother. The ending, which may leave the typical moviegoer scrathching his head and asking &quot;so what happens?&quot;, is brilliant in how the expressions on the brothers' faces explain how they feel; and there is no need for a long drawn out speech that screams for the Academy's attention. <br />This film, in essence is about getting old and how aging has its benefits as well as its tragedies; how anger and resentment of family and friends is really not worth it in the end.  Richard Farnsworth does a brilliant job that not many actors could have done. The wisdom he seems to have just by staring at him is astonishing. The second best line in the movie is when a young man asked him, &quot;What is the worst thing about getting old?&quot; and Alvin stares at him and says quietly, &quot;Remembering when you were young.&quot; The best line, of course is the last sentence of the movie which makes you feel happy as well as sad inside.<br />David Lynch did a beautiful job in making the cornfields of the midwest seem amazingly scenic; trust me, I have been through Iowa and it is not as gorgeous as he made it out to be. The soundtrack goes perfect with the movie also. And I did not even mention Sissy Spacek, who plays Alvin's daughter and she does a great job as well as the rest of the cast in playing characters touched by Alvin and his mission. <br />What makes a movie a classic or a great film is that after you watch it, you sit there and think about it and have discussions with your friends about it. This movie did that to me, and I have been reccommending it to all my friends. But I must warn you, you also have to be in the right mood for it, and it might be best if you either watched it alone or with only a couple of other people. It is a must see for anyone.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This is a terrific album...one of the few that I have liked from start to finish the first time through. Even better, I enjoy it more the more I listen to it. If you get the chance to see Dido in concert, do yourself a favor and do so. I have seen her twice in a small venue in Austin and she puts on a terrific show. I cannot wait for her next album. As one of the reviews said, she is somewhere between Portishead and Sarah McLaughlin. I strongly encourage you to pick this up.

B00000AF98|4.0|It's a dire shame that Crazy Nights was released as a Kiss album. Allow me to explain...and please, bear with me.<br />Kiss had dabbled in less hard rock-oriented styles at occasional points in their lengthy career. While this upset (and continues to upset) fans of the down-and-dirty Kiss era for which they are immortalized, it also proved that - despite some moans and groans - Kiss (or particuarly, Paul Stanley) could craft a trendy tune and stand ground alongside other output from 15-minute bands. If you're into factual premise, Billboard echoes the reality: Kiss' three biggest hits in the US, chart-wise, were (in this order): &quot;Beth&quot; (#7), &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You&quot; (#11), and &quot;Forever&quot; (#8). Two ballads and a disco tune. Oh, and in the UK, look what their biggest charting single was! &quot;Crazy Crazy Nights&quot; (#4)! Now that is bound to make the earliest of fans shake their fists and say &quot;well that's just commercialism - it reflects nothing of Kiss' cult status.&quot; You're absolutely right. But Crazy Nights was all about selling out. The 1980's were all about selling out. So cut it some slack.<br />On to the album itself. Like I said before, if a four-letter word (starts with a &quot;K&quot;, ends with &quot;iss&quot;) had been innocently removed from the cover and replaced by some other name, this album wouldn't have earned the reputation is holds today as being &quot;awful&quot;. In fact, it's stellar. It's not the Kiss that Kiss fans want, but that says nothing about the quality of the record. This record has more hooks than a kindergarten coatroom. The only other alternative I can think of that would have spared Crazy Nights from severe tongue-lashings is if Paul Stanley had released it as a solo album. After all, his tracks make the album what it is.<br />Specifically, &quot;Crazy Crazy Nights&quot; is infectuous and crowd-pleasing. It doesn't go beyond that - but that was clearly the target. &quot;I'll Fight Hell toHold You&quot;, in my opinion, is jaw-dropping in every respect. Wonderful. &quot;Bang Bang You&quot; - okay, it's a little rough around the edges in terms of recycled &quot;principles&quot; (if you can call them that) but it's still listenable and sentimentally Kiss. &quot;My Way&quot; - get over it, people, this song is good. I don't think it will be covered by any band anytime soon and it certainly hasn't aged well, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with it! It will be forever etched in 1987, plainly put, but the song is inspirational, melodic and uplifting (play this one next to &quot;War Machine&quot; from '82 and see what I mean). &quot;Reason to Live&quot; is a picture-perfect 1980's power ballad and whether we like it or not, Paul Stanley's forté is directed, more often than not, to balladry. Big points for that one. &quot;Turn on the Night&quot; (welcome aboard, Diane Warren!) could essentially have been any song on FM radio that year, but Paul carries it well and avoids dropping too far into the despairs of sentimentality. Gene Simmons (a name not-too-oft spoken that year, I don't suspect) gives only a mediocre performance - the reality is, he's much better at metal than at power-pop. He's so good at being a demon that he doesn't look good in a tutu. That's the best analogy I can give. &quot;No, No, No&quot; is my favourite (?) Simmons track on Crazy Nights.<br />So if you're just getting into Kiss and you liked Destroyer or something like that, and you want to expand your Kiss collection, I wouldn't suggest moving forth with this record. However, if you have it in you to kick back a bit and just enjoy what was happening with music at the time, this album will remain appealing. By any other band, this album would have been very well-received. By Kiss, it was torn to shreds.<br />But I like it, for what it's worth.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater. It was really well done. It isn't what you expect. There are quite a few of little twists. It is really excellent. Recommended viewing definitely.
B00003CX95|4.0|Great transfer of Braveheart to DVD.  The only problem I have at all is the commentary by Mel Gibson is weak compared to other commentaries.  Overall a must have.  An epic movie that all other epic movies will be based on.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|Before all the craze that went with the release of &quot;1984&quot; Van Halen in 1981 Brought out a real hard rocking collection of tunes in &quot;FAIR WARNING&quot; The best songs are &quot;MEAN STREET&quot; &quot;DIRTY MOVIES&quot; AND THE RADIO FAVERITE &quot;UNCHAINED&quot; All in All a true gem to have a must for any Van Halen fan.
0486282112|2.0|The idea of the book was very intelligent and interesting, dealing with rights and wrongs, accomplisments, actions and there consequences. But the book, to me, was written poorly. When reading the novel, my mind always wandered becasue of the dragging on of events. It used difficult language, uncommon words, and was saturated with too many words. The 160 page novel could have easily been shrinked down into an 100 page story. It was repititive in its ideas and difficult to concentrate on. It's not the worst book I've read for school, but I would definelty not read this book in my leisure time.
B000002HIK|4.0|let's end the debate once and for all right here.  both &quot;I Care Because You Do&quot; and &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; are excellent and essential techno recordings.  but alas, when 2 things are superbly done and from the same artist there is the need to rank them.  Richard D. James is better. case closed.<br />Now, on with the review of this album.<br />The identifying characterist of Aphex Twin versus other Techno artists are the sophisiticated rhythm patterns, the bitter sweet melodies and, accordingly, the delightful interplay between the two.  I think track #1 &quot;AcridAvid Jam&quot; is the best example of this.  Listen to the rhythm track and try to follow; it's a very sophisticated syncopated beat which both contrasts and compliments the light melody playing at the same time.  Both the rhythm and meoldy are clearly distinct and the listener can focus in on either one at any time and yet the 2 combine to provide a third distinct element which is the overall track itself.  <br />So why do I say &quot;Richard D. James Album&quot; is better?  The songs are more individual one to the next, more sophisiticated and it's a much further step removed from the trippy / trancy feel of this album.  <br />In any case, they both combine to make one terrific 2 album set in my CD player.  I'd have to say that Aphex Twin is just about the most sophisticated, consistent and truly artistic composer in the greater genre of techno operating today.  in his music you hear roots of the late great John Cage however in a much more presentable and accessible format.
B0000029DD|5.0|Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; may have been released in 1994, but is not of that time period in popular music; it is inherently difficult to classify or categorize, a timeless document of pure, self-indulgent artistic expression.  With Buckley's death by drowning in 1997, and despite some disappointing posthumous releases, it seems certain that nothing so inconvenient as the artists' later development will ever intrude upon the perfection of this release.  &quot;Grace&quot; is manifestly not for everyone--anyone not enamored of extended high notes, or melismatic singing, or songs difficult to dance to, will similarly not be enamored of this album.  For anyone else, however, this is worth a listen, or three or four; it took several listens before it began to grow on me.<br />An appreciation of &quot;Grace&quot; might begin with Buckley's voice:  he possessed an astonishing range, and brilliant purity of tone, and at the same time he was capable of inflecting that tone with fine nuances of emotion.  On &quot;Grace,&quot; his voice is applied with equal facility both to his own compositions and to several well-chosen covers:  Leonard Cohen's &quot;Hallelujah,&quot; &quot;Lilac Wine,&quot; perhaps best known as a Nina Simone song, and even a Benjamin Britten carol, &quot;Corpus Christi Carol.&quot;  Even the most radio-friendly songs (&quot;Last Goodbye,&quot; &quot;So Real&quot;) sound unique, while other tracks (&quot;Mojo Pin,&quot; &quot;Grace,&quot; &quot;Dream Brother&quot;) sound like nothing a top 40 artist would be capable of, much less like anything on the radio today.<br />By way of comparison, it is worth noting that Thom Yorke of Radiohead (among other singers) was influenced by Buckley during the recording of their albums &quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer,&quot; but comparisons will only take you so far.  Of all the discs is my collection, this is my clear favorite; you can do a great deal worse than seeing if it might be one of yours.
0375703764|4.0|HOUSE OF LEAVES is, at its core, an exploration of space: of human relationships expressed in terms of &quot;closeness&quot; and &quot;distance&quot; and of our need for each other.  This theme suffuses the simple but intriguing ghost story around which the rest of the novel is built, palimpsest-like, in three concentric circles of edition.  Add to this a bewildering array of creative typesetting devices and you have a novel that shouts its intention to play with form.  Perhaps surprisingly, the combinations work; this book is honestly fun to read.  Do not be put off by its strangeness.  Do not allow yourself to think that somehow the storytelling and writing quality have been sacrificed on the altar of novelty.  Rest assured, this is a well-told and interesting tale.  Go ahead and try it.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I haven't laughed this hard in years!   This is a spoof of many of the horror movies of the late eighties and nineties.  The main spoof is of Scream, with the main character being &quot;Cindy&quot;, note how close her name resembles &quot;Sydney&quot;.  I laughed through the whole thing - I especially liked Ms. Mann!   This is a definate must see, but due to the very adult nature (male nudity) it is definately for adults only! <br />A+
B00000K19E|5.0|Winner of two Academy Awards, The Matrix is a perfect ensemble of cast, effects (visual and sound), and story. <br />Keanu Reeves plays Neo, an ordinary human living an ordinary life until he finds out that the life he is living is nowhere near what he or anyone else believes it to be. Through powerful conversations with Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburne, and Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss, Neo learns that the life of people on Earth is actually a complex system of computer data known as The Matrix, which controls every sense and action known to &quot;man.&quot; Neo does not know what to think about this discovery, nor does he know how to grasp the new and electrifying powers given to him by Morpheus and his small yet stealth crew. Working together, they hope to achieve the one thing that they have been dreaming about: freedom. Freedom does not come easy, for many humans on Earth possess powers superior to that of Morpheus; these people are known as The Agents. <br />When the movie came out in theaters, it received rave reviews, and after seeing the film, it deserved all of them and more. When watching, one must pay close attention to the film, for each minute contains some form of information that is vital to the unfinished plot. The actors in the film are excellent, both with their intellectual dialogue and their playing out of the action sequences. The choreography of the film is stupendous, and fight scenes with and without gunplay looks real and unflawed. Special effects are all the craze for this film, and while most movies have the patented computer-animated look, this is the closest to reality that one can get, tying Independence Day for the best special effects ever in a motion picture. Under superb direction and stellar performances, The Matrix is a thrill-ride into the surrealism of fact vs. reality. <br />The DVD edition of the film boasts superior color fidelity and image sharpness, pleasing the eye with detail for a film that deserves it. Sound design utilizes the .1 LFE channel at almost every turn, engaging especially in gunfight scenes and powerful explosions. The scene in which Neo moves faster than bullets is a remarkable piece of sound effects editing, utilizing the .1 LFE as well as the surround channels. A terrific example of how DVD video should be produced.
B0000020C4|5.0|Aside from the original cast of Lez Miz, I should say that they added more voice quality artists such as Michael Ball, Ruthie Henshall and this crystalline voice Lea Salonga. Michael Ball's easily the best Marius ever. And I should say that Ruthie Henshall is a better Fantine. While, Lea Salonga herself's easily the most memorable Eponine. No other singer/artists to have a voice like Lea not even Debbie Gibson. This is  truely the DREAM CAST. These 3 can reach high notes and that doesnt hurt your ears. If they think Francese Rufelle and Patti Lupone fits their roles,  we are talking about better singers here. That's why it's called DREAM CAST.
B0000024PC|3.0|The Graduate soundtrack is a mix of some lounge-music orchestral highlights, which certainly fit 1967, and several versions of S&amp;G songs, including Mrs. Robinson and The Sounds of Silence.  It is fun to listen to the differences in these songs, since they feel like alternate versions, and not repetitious.  This is a soundtrack album which features both the pop and instrumental music of its time, although this is probably not for the casual Simon &amp; Garfunkel fan.
0486266885|4.0|The strange case of Dr. Jekll and Mr. Hyde is a great book. It is filled with action, thrill, and horror. I thought that Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Lewis Stevenson did a great job setting the time back in London, 1886, during the industrial revolution. I also thought that the book was very provokial. It really made me think about how how each and every one of us has the potential to be a Mr. Hyde. Another thing i liked about this book is that it was a great  psychological thriller. I really enjoyed reading it, and wojuld recomend it to anyone who can read, throught the ages of 10 - too old to read.
B0000025ZK|5.0|If you listen to About Face and Roger Water's Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking (relaeased a year earelier), you can HEAR the two components that once were Pink Floyd - Waters has all the concept and deep, biting lyrics, while Gilmour has the voice, is unbeatable with a guitar and makes the music SOUND good.  Floyd purists will dismiss this album as too &quot;pop&quot;, and it does depart sharply from the obsessiveness of The Final Cut, but no one can deny that this is ear candy (in a good way) straight through, with some of Gilmour's best guitar work, since he was free to do as he pleased.  The opener, UNTIL WE SLEEP, sounds just like Pink Floyd would during Momentary Lapse and The Division Bell years - stunning guitar, haunting voice.  The album has hit singles in BLUE LIGHT (i dont love the song but it did make radio and MTV airplay) plus hits waiting to be discovered in ALL LOVERS ARE DERANGED and CRUISE (i dont know why gilmour bothers to try his hand at a political statement when he knows roger waters does it better).  There are some lighter, but enjoyable tracks in. LOVE ON THE AIR and OUT OF THE BLUE.  Two of the more haunting, standout tracks (in addition to the excellent UNTIL WE SLEEP) are MURDER and NEAR THE END.  If you liked Pink Floyd after Waters left the band, you will LOVE this album (and if you only like Roger Waters, of course you won't).  It was nice to hear Gilmour get to lighten up a bit out of the constraints of the Pink Floyd that Waters ran like a dictator, and this album previews what Floyd would do in the late 80s and 90s.  Great guitar work in almost every song, a short intrumental treat in LET'S GET METAPHYSICAL, overall a fine album.
6305609691|3.0|Back in its day, this movie may have bid well.  Unfortunately it is too tame for the modern day &quot;insane from war&quot; image.  By the time the viewer finally meets Mr. Lunatic the movie has grown very disinteresting.  One can enjoy the countless smoke effects and constant citing of poetry, if interested in that canned garbage, but otherwise they just dont care.  The builidup is too minimal for what is an unusual and quite a disconcerting payoff.  This seems to be my only qualm though, as the case may have it, because otherwise I enjoyed the characters.  A surfing general, who of course, classicly states &quot;I love the smell of napalm in the morning&quot;.  Some of the outlandishness is enjoyable to no end, and you dont get tired of it, but as a war movie based on lunacy and mindlessness, it's outdated.
B00004X01U|4.0|Certainly it does. Spanning close to 2 decades in her career,Madonna is MUSIC personified.With her new release aptly titled Music, Madonna is back to once again give us pure pop glory.At first listen,one could link songs from Madonna's past works(not that I'm complaining)Songs like &quot;amazing&quot; echoed heavilly on &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot;...&quot;impressive instant&quot; is likened to &quot;thief of hearts&quot; from the Erotica album.But all in all this offering is as pop as pop music can get. The feel of the whole album is gaily,whimsical and fun.

0679721037|5.0|Hiroshima isn't meant to be great entertainment. The point of journalist John Hersey's account of six survivors of the Hiroshima bombing (Miss Sasaki, Rev. Tanimoto, Father Kleinsorge, Dr. Sasaki, Dr. Fuji, and Mrs. Nakamura) is meant to be an unbiased view of the actual horrors of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima that killed over 100,000 residents of that city.<br />John Hersey carries the book right along, never holding up for a minute. All the details of the accounts of the six survivors are written in great deal, and create a series of emotions unsurpassed by many works of both fiction and non-fiction on the subject. <br />For all of you readers who found it boring, I guess you didn't understand what you were getting into. This book must be read with the knowledge that it is a journalist's account of the bombing of Hiroshima, not a straight-forward work of non-fiction. <br />P.S. In all the new publications of the book, a detailed account of the lives of the six survivors the years following the Hiroshima bombing is included as a kind of epilogue written still by John Hersey.
0385484518|5.0|The summer after I graduted from grammer school,  I got this reading list from the high school saying I had to read books. So I went to my library and found this book. I wonder how good it could be. I took it out for 2 weeks. As soon as I got home, I opened it as fast I could.<br />   For those two weeks, every chance I had to read I picked that book up. I couldn't belive that a collage graduted would actually do that for an old teacher. The more I read the more I became fascnated by Mitch coming over every Tuesday. As I came to the end of the book I was sad when Morrie died because I learned something from this book.<br />   Those things were you always have a friend in the world and no matter what the race people are all the same in the world. I also think if people get to read this book, they are missing out on one of the greatest books ever written.
0375501851|5.0|This book is brilliant! If you are a lover of literature (not novel) you will like this book, and Zadie Smith's writing style. The reader is constantly being reminded of the writer's intellectual ability (not pompously though) with the capacity to come down-to-earth. I had to pace myself, set the book aside for periods, (longest was about 2 weeks) so I can savor the enjoyment! The way Zadie Smith weaves a minor incident that happened years ago into the climatic end of the book is so masterful that one could compare the her to literary giant. If the book was longer than a thousand pages I would have kept on reading it. Highly recommended, your intellect would thank you.
0934742529|3.0|. . . Of a complex and important profession.  Sir Harold Nicolson's book, originally published near the beginning of WWII, filled a large gap for several decades.  Many books have been written on statecraft, and even a few on the tactics used in statecraft and diplomacy, but never (since Castiglioni's Art of the Courier during the Renaissance) had a book been written on how to be a good diplomat.<br /> The book begins with a short history of the development of modern diplomacy, and then moves on to discuss recent changes and factors in modern diplomacy and to compare diplomacy as practiced by different countries.  In reality, this is a handbook for new and aspiring diplomats, as it covers such things as the day-to-day duties of a junior secretary and how to perform them, diplomatic jargon, and proper use of diplomatic techniques.<br /> For the conduct of foreign policy, I would recommend Chas. Freeman's more recent book Arts of Power.  However, there is still nothing, outside of official government handbooks, that describes the inner functionings of a diplomat's life so well as Nicolson's book.
B00004X01U|4.0|After Ray of Light came out, I wondered where Madonna would next go after the hoopla of that album died down.  I think Music answers the question with another question of whether she wants to continue this way or go country.  The album cover gives us a whole new look of Madonna with the countrywestern motif she's sporting and the very interesting way she's staring at her guitar.  Here is my view of all the songs.....<br />Music:  Love the song, very catchy with a funk/techno approach that makes me think of her early years.  <br />Impressive Instant:  Very experimental and very catchy but her &quot;new&quot; voice kind of reminds me of Aqua.  I doubt this song will do very well but Barbie Girl did very well so who knows.<br />Runaway Lover: Very disco and kind of catchy.  I like this one.<br />I deserve It:  A song about her man and it's an alright song.<br />Amazing: Great song!!  Sounds like a very distant relative to Beautiful Stranger but different enough that it isn't considered a carbon copy(to people who complain that it sounds like BB should listen to any Mariah Carey/Britney Spears song)<br />Nobody's Perfect: Great potential but that encoder thing she has kind of distracts.<br />Don't Tell Me:  Love it!!! I think this is a good decision to make it the second single(if rumors are true).  Very folky with a great beat.<br />What it feels like for a girl: Good song, interesting start, hope it's a later single.<br />Paradise(Not for Me): Weird on first listen, give it a few more listens and you will like it's quirks.<br />Gone:  Good song with a great backbeat.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|This movie starts out with action and then keeps on going! There is never a low time especially when Master P. is out to get Cage.

B00003CXE6|5.0|I've always been a fan of the 'sword and sandal' epics of the '60s (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc) and I was thrilled to see the genre brought up to date with 'Gladiator'. I don't think Gladiator can fairly be compared to the old classics though, as some have done; different directing methods, cinematography, and other aspects make it difficult. <br />'Gladiator' is an outstanding film in its own right. The visuals go a long way towards giving us some idea of what ancient Rome really looked like; I especially revelled in the overhead shots of the city and the Coliseum. The set pieces, the battle in Germania, all the fights in the arena are extremely well done and realistic. The attention to detail was amazing.<br />But the thng that makes the movie shine is Russell Crowe's portrayal of a man who has lost everything, and will risk all that he has left, for revenge. A simple story really, but Crowe as Maximus gives the character a lot of depth and I found his character inspiring. Leaders like Maximus are few and far between, and not always appreciated by those they serve. A man like Maximus inspires others to great things and helps raise them up. I'd follow him to hell and back!<br />The other supporting cast is also great. Joaquin Phoenix does a fine job as the evil Commodus. Sure, Commodus a lunatic, but in the opening scenes with Emperor Claudius, at least you can see where he's coming from. Oliver Reed is great in his last performance, and the actor who plays Maximus' African friend (can't recall his name) ads a poignant touch (I especially liked his last scene in the Coliseum at the end, when he buries the dolls of Maximus' family in the earth of the Coliseum).<br />Scenes like that, and others; the scenes with Maximus walking through the wheatfields, the German barbarians screaming their defiance, Maximus and his men refusing to die in the arena, make this movie a real blockbuster.
0823003035|5.0|Tony's book The Artists Complete Guide to Figure Drawing is full of beautiful illustrations and directions on how to draw the human form. It's written in a way that makes it easy to visualize what he's teaching. This book is really a treasure I find myself referring back to it all the time. <br />The instrucions are specific the steps are methodical. Its easy to understand but it does take practice. <br />I really love the way Tony illustrates how to draw the human figure and fill in with specific directions to complete a beautifuly renderded form. His examples and metaphores are unique. I can actually pretend that I'm in class and hear his voice.<br />The drawings are incredible there is something new to discover every time you turn the page.<br />This book is the best I've read on how to. It's a must in every students library and it's worth every penny.<br />Thank you Tony for a great book.

Trane's quest for enlightenment started around 1958-'59 when he decided to quit using heroine. I have read that some of his teeth fell out due to heroine usage, and he had to wear dentures.  He had to reteach himself how to make an effective embouchure over the mouthpiece with his false teeth, frustrating him greatly.  <br />He had become disgruntled with the stationary hard bop scene, along with personal dissatisfaction with his habits, and vowed to push on. &quot;Aknowledgement,&quot; &quot;Resolution,&quot; &quot;Pursuance,&quot; and &quot;Psalm&quot; illustrate Coltrane's ever growing need to explore not only music, but life and mysticism.<br />This album is an offering to God.<br />Absolutely masterful
0553274503|5.0|I can't say enough about how good this book is.  It will touch your heart, and you will never forget it.  It is written entirely in the first person, and the character is what I would call a real hero.  This is easily the most compelling book I have ever read.  It will entirely change your perspective on people living with retardation of any kind.
B000002I27|5.0|A bit more polished by production than their classic debut, this album has the same dark, almost unsure-about-the-situation feel. The ability to create that ominous mood is why the Doors are classic.<br />&quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; is a beautiful love song, and &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; is a male anthem, but the females dig it too.<br />&quot;Strange Days,&quot; and &quot;People Are Strange&quot; are quirky classics. &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; is a personal favorite, and &quot;When The Music's Over&quot; is an unbridled jam, encompassing some of Morrison's best long form poetry on a Doors album.<br />Essential for any 60s rock collection.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie had it all.  It touched the part deep inside of all men that wants to die valantly.  Maximus fights with courage and purpose.
B000003489|5.0|This is high octane Coltrane. This album runs the gamut from the explosive, to the mystical; from the melancholy, to the exuberant.<br />A big MUST for any fan of any type of jazz.  <br />The title cut is immaculate with it's famous complex chord changes, and &quot;Syeeda's Song Flute&quot; is on of the most mysterious songs I have heard. Coltrane's &quot;sheets of sound&quot; period is generally regarded as peaking at this album. Also, &quot;Spiral&quot; is not to be missed. <br />Excellent album.  Many will argue it's superiority.
0393317552|5.0|What can I say? This was a Pulitzer winner and I have to agree. He does an excellent job of presenting his thesis and exposing a different way of looking at the reason why the European cultures came to dominate our globe. As an aspiring novelist who was looking for a foundation to shape his own fictional settings I found this text provided a wealth of thoughts. Of course, some of my friends would say I'm always off in my own fictious world anyway!
B000002UC5|4.0|&quot;Maybe I'm Amazed,&quot; although commercial, is still a heart tugger. The rest of these *silly little love songs* are fun, lighthearted tunes.  <br />Great, smooth McCartney vocals.  Linda does not play, although she is obviously very important in the scheme of the album.<br />Written mainly under the ravages of the Beatles decline, this album does not seem quite full.  Though, it has some charm due to its artsy, borderline weirdness and quaint sensitivities.
6301955595|5.0|After a long abscence Jodorowsky returned with this surreal, but more accessible offering than his earlier work; focusing on a circus, and starring Jodorowsky's son and grandson as Fenix, a young boy who witnesses his father cut off the arms of his mother before commiting suicide.<br />Then we see Fenix grown up and finding his mother again, and she uses him as her slave, using his hands for her various needs and also to commit murder. There are the trademark Jodorowsky images in parts, with deformed people on a trip out from an asylum, and powerful scenes like an elephant being savaged for food; but it somehow has a more warmer and humble feel to it than his previous work.
B00000348D|5.0|This is a ground breaking piece.<br />I think it is a shame that commercialism inherently taints creativity, and the will to try something different.  To push ground.  It's sad.  Many a jazz artist have struggled with this.  Some would say this has even KILLED jazz artists, and popular artists alike.  <br />Ornette Coleman is one of the last living testaments to a time when it was exciting and fresh to be &quot;outlandish.&quot;<br />Don't buy this unless you know what it is, or unless you want your conception of music broadened immensely.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie was incredible!  Lots of action, blood, and gore.  Russel Crowe does an excellent job in his role.  The drama and suspence are comparible to Braveheart and Patriot!  See this in the theatures now or do yourself a favor and by it on DVD with Digital surround sound system.  Enjoy!
1881273156|5.0|I'll put it simply.  You'll pick it up with skepticism.  You'll read it nonstop in a couple of hours.  You'll feel embarrassed by your behavior towards your mate and stupid for not seeing it before.  You'll feel empowered with a concrete and simple language to express your needs.  You'll head home and start all over.  You and she/he will do one of two things.  1 - Start making each other feel loved.  2 - Agree to move on.<br />You've got nothing to lose.<br />One suggestion to the publisher:  Hire a new graphic designer.
B00004X01U|5.0|I am an avid Madonna fan(since I was 10 in 1989-&quot;Like A Prayer&quot; Days..)I will tell you that at first I appeared a bit let down...After &quot;Music&quot; ...and &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;...I started to say 'uh-oh'.But...by the time you get to the dance infused &quot;RUNAWAY LOVER&quot; ....I was already changing my mind!By the end of the 'ride' of this album..I was ready for another go around..&lt;I'm relistening to it the 2nd time now&gt;!Some of the best songs are:&quot;Runaway Lover&quot;&quot;Amazing&quot;&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;Some of the others will take a grasp of thought and understanding...but they are excellent as well.If you are an avid/long time Madonna fan, or you became a fanatic of the style of RAY OF LIGHT....get your azz 2 da store!!You need this album!!!:-)~~ Rock it on M A D O N N A!!
B00004X01U|4.0|After hearing the title track, I was a little wary of hearing the rest of &quot;Music.&quot; But, every track on this CD is an aural experience all it's own! I am probably one of the rare ones who will like this CD more than &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, which I felt to be very contrived.<br />The title track is disposable...boring and repetitive. The track &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is wonderful...reminiscent of Eiffel 65 with a touch of Daft Punk. If &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; doesn't become a club hit, then something is terribly wrong. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; has endless remix possiblities. I really like &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, which sounds as if it could be on a David Lynch or Gus Van Sant soundtrack. The song &quot;Amazing&quot; is just that...sounding a great deal like &quot;I Deserve It&quot; on steroids. &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; takes a little getting used to. The vocoder is rather overused on this, and the instrumentation sounds as if it was done on a old Casio keyboard. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; shows that Madonna has the possiblity of being a good singer, but alas her voice still VERY thin, but versatile. &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is probably my favorite track. This track is great to play while driving. &quot;Paradise&quot; I found to be irritating with Madonna's ethereal whispering. The intruments overpower her vocals, making what she's singing almost unintelligible. &quot;Gone&quot; is a lyrical smorgasbord...requiring multiple listens to appreciate the intricate lyrics.<br />With the exception of the tracks &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, and &quot;Paradise&quot;, this is a great collection of wonderful songs! I recommend it highly to anyone who is a Madonna or pop-tronica fan.
0780631684|5.0|I loved this movie. Great special effects. Plot was ok. What really caught my attention was the deaths, both innovative and realistic. The bath tub scene was probably one of the best deaths in a movie to date. The movie ruled! Get it!
0871137380|5.0|I'll keep this review short. Buy and read this book, it should be required reading for all Americans. I haven't even finished the book, and yet I felt compelled to write a review. whether or not you agree with the politics of why we were in Somalia, this book is a real eye opener into what our troops do all over the world daily. We owe our troops, especially combat vetrans, our deepest gratitude and respect for the job they do. If you were there and are reading this review, THANK YOU!!!!. This is an incredible story of courage and heroism in the face of overwhelming odds. A great read.
B000002GVZ|5.0|Carly Simon straddled the world between folk and pop music in the early 1970s and gradually emerged from the shadow of other folk titans to become a pop singer of verve and moment, earning herself a place in the pantheon of very successful singers like Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, and a number of others like Carol King who were on the pop charts and in the folk clubs earlier in their career. This album is a wonderful summary of the best of her efforts in those early years, although it obviously does not have any of her later work. Still, from her breakthrough hits like \\"That's The Way I've Always Heard It Should Be\\" and \\"Anticipation\\" to later smash singles like \\"Loving You Is the Right Thing To Do\\" and \\"You're So Vain\\" (rumored to be written about everyone from James Taylor to Mick Jagger, but more likely a joke aimed at actor Warren Beatty) is all here. This collection successfully gathers the best of those early years in one place, and even though I usually prefer to sample an artist in context in their early albums, even I have to admit this is a good introduction to Carly Simon.<br />There are a lot of good songs here, like the terrific \\"Legend In Your Own Time\\" about then beau James Taylor, and the rocking \\"Mockingbird\\", a duet done with Taylor. Indeed, there are other interesting, provocative, and beautiful selections here, including my own personal favorite, &quot;I haven't Got Time For The Pain\\". This is a great quick look at a fascinating artist who later made a terrific comeback album called &quot;Coming Around Again&quot; to regain her audience and popularity, which she used to great advantage in the years since. It is one of her best and most autobiographical confessional albums, and it gives us an interesting vantage point with which to understand her better. This greatest hits album, though, is a terrific \\"greatest hits\\" album by an artist who is often under-appreciated. This is one I heartily recommend. Enjoy
B000021Y7X|5.0|Until I saw this video,all I remembered about The Talking Heads was &quot;Take Me To The River&quot;.How much I had to learn! Since seeing the DVD,I have bought all of their albums and gained a real appreciation for the musical genius of David Byrne and company.This is a wonderfully produced movie which touches all of the senses,especially in a home theater environment.Unlike some of the other classics,like&quot;Woodstock&quot; and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;,there is no empty space or meaningless footage.Something great is happening every second.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|I was lucky enough to be living in England just outside London in a little town called West Ruislip just down the cobbled streets from the &quot;T&quot; station near the famous &quot;Orchards&quot; pub when Dire Straits released their &quot;Love Over Gold&quot; album in 1982, and the young English couple living in the flat upstairs played it over and over, introducing me both to their good taste in music and the terrific group called &quot;Dire Straits&quot; in the process. Of course, as I think back upon it, I was familiar with their hit &quot;Sultans Of Swing&quot;, but never really paid much attention until hearing this terrific album and Mark Knopfler's unbelievably stirring, crisp and innovative guitar solos. Soon I was down at the music shoppe buying their other albums, including \\"Making Movies\\". By that time I was familiar with their unique and unforgettable sound and also their very introspective lyrics. I came to love this album as much as &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, and several of the cuts are my favorites.<br />Starting with the first cut, &quot;Tunnel Of Love\\", an epic guitar rendition owing much to a Springsteen-like treatment of the material, Knopfler's distinctive twanging guitar sound echoed in my flat to all hours of the morning, along with &quot;Romeo And Juliet\\", &quot;Solid Rock\\", and a very hot and steamy &quot;Expresso Love\\", and from such nice English boys! In the short two years I lived in Britain, Knopfler became a kind of institutionalized artistic force everywhere one looked, writing soundtrack music for (among other films) &quot;Local Hero&quot; and &quot;Cal&quot;, performing both alone and with Dire Straits, and collaborating with other artists, as well. The music here is very and innovative progressive rock, and the electric guitar work literally sings by itself. When I listen to the album now, it is a source of continuing amazement to me that Knopfler could make the sounds that emanated out of that instrument so uniquely animated as it is. The whole band is terrific, and it is sad that they made so few albums before internal frictions broke them apart. Enjoy this and their other wonderful albums. Here in &quot;Making Movies&quot; they make an indelible stamp on modern rock that I am sure you will find entertaining and entrancing. Enjoy!it is.

B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is an unexpected movie from David Lynch's hands. When I first saw this in a local cinema I was mesmerized by the movie's beautiful imagery, music and storytelling.<br />This movie tells the true story of Alvin Straight, an old man with a bad hip. When he hears his brother, whom he hasn't spoken to in years due to some argument, has had a seizure he feels he has to see him, to once again sit side-by-side and look at the stars. As he has no means of transportation and refuses to be driven or brought, he takes his '66 lawnmower and starts to drive it from Iowa to Wisconsin.<br />On his journey he meets a number of strangers with whom he shares experiences and wisdom through honest, personal and simple stories. This is beautifully depicted by Richard Farnsworth's role as Alvin who got an Acadamy Award(r) nomination for his performance.<br />Alvin's journey, this old man's character, his encounters with the strangers he meets, the music and the unrushedness of the movie impressed me so much I went to see it three times in a row. Because the movie is not a roller-coaster ride, but takes its time to let everything sink in you finally have to time to really appreciate every aspect of it.<br />Allthough this movie hasn't become a major block-buster, I know nobody who has seen it who hasn't also seen it twice. Definately one of the better movies of '99.<br />Do yourself a favour, buy it.
B000002KHY|5.0|I was lucky enough to first see James Taylor live in a small outdoor venue called Avaloch in rural Lenox, Massachusetts in the summer of 1970, after this first album recorded by the Beatles in London had been released and just before the release of the fabulously successful \\"Sweet Baby James\\" album by Warner Brothers. He appeared alone on-stage with a full head of long, long hair in a simple denim shirt and cut-up jeans with his four or five acoustic guitars, and for two and a half hours proceeded to absolutely enchant the sprawling lawn-full of hundreds of audience members with a spellbinding performance of all of the work from both of those albums. Although virtually unknown at the time, word of mouth had spread so quickly in the Berkshires area (who still considers him one of their own) that many of us went out to get this album to play before he appeared. The rest, as they say, is history.<br />This is a fantastic collection of his greatest hits over those first ten years, and is a terrific summary of that work. Many of my favorites are here, including \\"Something In The Way She Moves\\", \\"Carolina In My Mind\\", and \\"Rainy Day Man\\". Of course, so is \\"Fire And rain\\", \\"You've Got A Friend\\", \\"Steamroller Blues\\", and \\"Country Road\\", all now Taylor standards. My all time favorite song from this album is \\"Sweet Baby James\\", which is sung about the Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts where I grew up, so I have always considered this a special song.  His performance on it is a brilliant early indication of just how incredibly talented an interpretive artist Taylor really is. He always pleases with songs like \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\", \\"Mexico\\", and \\"Walking Man\\", and this album is sure to please even the most cautious music fan. It is certainly a terrific showcase for how well Taylor can deliver on a variety of original works and covers of traditional folk songs. Enjoy
B00004XMTH|5.0|I MUST TELL YOU THAT IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME BEFORE GOING TO SEE THE BRAOADWAY PLAY,I MUST ADMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG,I ENJOYED CATS SO MUCH THAT I WAS AT THE LAST PUBLIC SHOWING ON B'WAY,WHAT A THRILL.WHEN I NOTICED THE VIDEO ON AMAZOM&quot;S SITE,I HAD TO HAVE IT,I COULD'NT WAIT UNTIL THE VIDEO ARRIVED,I,RIPED OPEN THE BOX ,POPPED THE VIDEO INTO MY VCR AND I WAS RELIVING THE FEELING OF BEING IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE WINTER GARDEN THEATER IN NEW YORK,THE VIDEO WILL BE WATCHED BY MANY&amp;THE,THIS VERSION WAS GREAT &amp; I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT,AND AS I WOULD SAY&quot;THE MEMORIES WILL LIVE FOREVER.
B000031XBQ|4.0|As a HUGE fan of Euro-dance, I have always held a special place in my heart for ABBA as they are pretty much the forefathers of our modern-day dance music. Their melodies and arrangements are incredible to this day. As a great ABBA fan, I tend to buy anything that is ABBA. So, when I ran across &quot;ABBA-Oro Grandes Exitos&quot;, I went ahead and grabbed it. While the entire album is made up of Spanish language versions of some of their major hits, ABBA's spirit and excellence does not get lost in the translation. Just as rich and warm as the original English versions, these songs are given an added spark of nostalgia when turned into Spanish. This special collection of the Swedish group singing their English hits in Spanish is highly recommended.
B000006TRV|5.0|My sister got this back in 1980 and I played it more than she did!  It was the last time the vintage Pink Floyd were all together.  Rick Wright was fired during The Final Cut and Roger Waters himself split on A Momentary Lapse of Reason.  In addition, this is one of the last &quot;big time&quot; concept albums (Pete Townshend would write more concept albums as would Roger Waters).<br />You have to hear it all to fully appreciate it!  The story is a little obscure to many, and it was to me until reading interviews and commentaries about this album.  Our hero Pink uses bricks to build a wall to shelter himself from the many mishaps in his life: &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; (part 1)- his father leaves while serving in war (based on Roger Waters' real father who was killed in WWII), &quot;The Happiest Days&quot;/&quot;Another Brick&quot; (part 2)- mistreatment in school and rebellion to follow, &quot;Mother&quot; deals with his overprotective mother, Pink grows up in &quot;Young Lust&quot;, faces unrequited love: &quot;Don't Leave Me Now&quot;/&quot;Another Brick (part 3), shuts himself off from society: &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;/&quot;Hey You&quot;/&quot;Anybody Out There?&quot;, and finally faces his personal demons: &quot;Stop&quot;/&quot;The Trial&quot;.  There's more to the story than that (and this is just my own interpretation).  You'll have to listen for yourself.<br />Roger Waters outdid himself with this story and he had some help from Wright, Nick Mason, and especially David Gilmour (who never got the respect he deserved from Waters).  Also Bob Ezrin's orchestrations are great.  Other guests include the Islington School (whose payback was free time in the studio), and Toni Tenille (yes, from the Captain and Tenille- &quot;What a fabulous room!&quot;).
0780622650|1.0|They should have taken some of the money spent on special effects and bought a decent script.  Who in their right mind would send a completely dysfunctional family, and an oversexed pilot to try and save the world??  I sure wouldn't want to depend on these people for my salvation.  The only bright spot in this movie is an expected great performance by Gary Oldman (does he ever disappoint??) as Doctor Smith.  William Hurt as Professor Robinson - pullleeeze!  He's been freeze-dried for years.  They should have kept more of the flavor of the TV series in it.  This movie is a waste of time and has no redeeming value.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|Set in the Midwest during the autumn, the visual imagery itself is enough to make you want to own this film, breathtaking shots corn fields and roads stretching out as far as the eye can see, this to me sums up the USA and made me want to visit. Deviating from his usual style of directing, Lynch provides a touching and sometimes tearful insight into the life of Alvin Straight, a man who rode a lawnmower across several states in order to visit his sick brother one last time.   Touching at the heartstring as you see how the suffering endured by Alvin in order to see his brother affects him, strongly recommended to those people who usually find Lynch's work overwhelming This will bring a sigh as you watch Alvin meet strangers along the way and how each meeting can affect a person in one way or another, always determined and forthright in his mission Alvin will show you what it is like to be old and honourable.  To sum the film up in one word - Stunning -
6305922756|5.0|A while back I reviewed the DVD release of PINK FLOYD-THE WALL and gave it a perfect review for it's extra content and actually making you feel good about spending your hard earned money for a DVD player. The same goes here for THIS IS SPINAL TAP. The extras that have been provided on this DVD are excellent. Including almost an hours worth of outtakes which in some cases should've been used in the movie itself. Also included are the videos that were done to promote the movie, tv spots and an in character interview with Marty DiBergi which is pretty funny but my favorite is the commentary done over the movie by the 3 members of Spinal Tap themselves. Most of the time the commentary drowns out the movie but it's good to check out once before you watch the movie and if you know the comical capibilities of Derek,David and Nigel you know it's worth checking out. PINK FLOYD-THE WALL is the BEST DVD I own at this point but THIS IS SPINAL TAP definitely comes very close.
B00000JBFW|4.0|This release probably deserves a mediocre rating of three stars...but c'mon, it's the reunion album!  You have to at least bump up the score one more point.  This album is what I mentioned before, &quot;mediocre.&quot;  Three really memorable songs, the rest are average.  None of the average ones are bad at all, but nothing special.  What can be said about &quot;Knocking at your back door?&quot;  It's the best song on here.  Lord opens up with a almost &quot;creeping&quot; sound and then Ritchie delivers the great, plodding rythm for the entire song.  A memorable chorus as well.  The slow &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; laced with good lyrics is a great listen.  The last classic on here is &quot;Gypsy's Kiss&quot; with its fun lyrics and energy-packed guitar solo.  I love it when Gillan shouts &quot;Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed!&quot;  Total fun.  Another spot to listen for is &quot;Under the Gun&quot; when Gillan lets out that gargling yelp!     This was an average release.  Some classics, mostly average stuff.  This would be followed by the different, but great &quot;House of Blue Light&quot; and the overlooked &quot;Battle Rages On.&quot;
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a book so filled with remorse and sadness, it's amazing that the reader somehow finds themself completely and joyfully satisfied.  The novel revolves around the penniless childhood of Frank McCourt and begins in America with four-year-old Frank and his three year-old brother Malachy, who bears the same name as his father, and the infant twins, Eugene and Oliver, and the memories of the baby Margaret, \\"already dead and gone.\\" Your heart goes out to the poor family, blessed with a loving mother, Angela, and yet cursed with a father who means well, but is constantly drunk or yearning for the \\"pint,\\" as they call it. Early in his life, McCourt's family moves to Ireland, with help from his aunts and grandmother. Unfortunately, money is not easily found in Ireland either, and the McCourt family migrates from home to home, barely surviving on the few shillings Malachy McCourt doesn't spend at the local pub.  The McCourts experience tragedy upon tragedy. His physical romance with a young lady named Theresa Carmody sick with consumption, his unfortunate habit to \\"interfere with himself,\\" and the sad moment when in a drunken stupor on his first pint he strikes his own mother causes Frank to fear he is doomed to an eternity in hell.  Unbelievably, despite all of the terrible things that happen in Frank's childhood, there are moments described in the book that give the reader a complete sense of joy and hope.  I immensely enjoyed this memoir and would recommend it to any reader. I was especially enamored of the style of writing in which Frank McCourt chose to write.  The words seemed as if they gently tumbled directly out of the mouth of the seven-year-old Frankie, or mischievously flew from Frank as an thirteen-year-old \\"working man.\\"  This novel was exquisitely written and is a jewel to read, as well as a treasure to remember.
B000001GAO|5.0|This recording is one of the most exciting and emotional performance of Mozart's Requiem I have heard, maybe better than the Bohm's one, with the VPO in 1971 (an excellent performance also). The Introitus and the Lacrimosa are amazing, wonderful, and the very slow tempo Bernstein chose increases infinitely the tension, the drama, and brings you to the top of emotion.<br />Simply marvellous.<br />A must for all the music lovers and a excellent choice to compare with Bohm or Karajan.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen (on par if not better than Braveheart).  The blend of plot, action, drama, and special effects was perfect and Russell Crow was amazing, the ultimate hero/champion.
B00004X01U|2.0|In which Madonna -- between trans-Atlantic hair color appointments -- phones in some half-hearted vocals and sub-first draft lyrics and then instructs her record company to hire some producers-du-jour to make it all sound like Tupac and Roger's &quot;California Love.&quot; Silliest tricks: She slathers on lots of vocoder effects because Cher won that Grammy and raps in French because dating that English movie guy and hanging out with Rupert make her more European. High-points: The hysterically funny string of lyrical cliches in &quot;I Deserve It&quot; makes you think  of Survivor (the band, not the TV show) and the annoying digital tomfoolery on &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; makes you take out the cd to see if it's scratched. And then there's the sound of the dentist's drill on &quot;Gone&quot; that both pays homage to &quot;Marathon Man&quot; and wakes you up to let you know the album's over. Best idea: She borrows Patsy Cline's wardrobe.
B00003Q43A|1.0|This must be one of the worst movies ever. Maybe it's because I hate Will Smith, maybe it's because I don't want to watch anything that makes me proud to be human! I just don't have words for this.
0684833395|1.0|Pathetic.<br />I forced myself to finish this book because it was heralded as &quot;one of the greatest novels of the century.&quot;  I found it an amazing chore to trudge through page after page of absurd, repetitive babble, replete with needless descriptions of depraved immorality.  <br />If the point is that government/military institutions are insanely inefficient and bureaucratic, ok.  I got that in the first 100 pages.  Were the next 400 pages simply meant to illustrate that point -- making me &quot;experience&quot; the absurdity?.  I really can't believe I read the whole thing.<br />In all sincerity, I can not recommend this book.
B00004Y6TQ|1.0|hearing bjork sing is like X-Men's wolverine putting his metal claws THROUGH THE BLACKBOARD and pulling down the slate!  this is an awful cd and DANCER IN THE DARK is a godawful musical.  she won best actress at cannes?  puh-leez!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE MOST FUNNIEST MOVIE YOU'LL  EVER SEE!  I SAW IT 3 TIMES AND IT GETS BETTER EVER SINGLE TIME SEE IT!  I WAITED FOR MONTHS FOR THIS MOVIE TO COME OUT ON THEATERS AND DVD! NOW I CAN PREORDER IT!  THANK GOD!
B00004W55E|5.0|It is truly amazing what this artist can do with her voice!  She makes it sound like there are absolutely no limits to what amazing sounds she can make: her voice floats, glides, bellows, bends, beeps, and many other things that you cannot describe on paper!  Her breath control is astounding, as she can hold a note for what seems to be forever!  I cannot think of any other artist that even comes close to her in ANY genre.<br />Although ALL the songs are special in their own right, I am currently hooked on &quot;Why You Wanna Mess It All Up&quot; and &quot;Run To You&quot;.  The note she hits near the end of &quot;Run To You&quot; is unbelievable!  You have to hear it to believe it!<br />We had to wait 8 years for this one.. hopefully we won't have to wait another 8 years for her next wonderful collection!
0396085725|5.0|I was assigned to read this book over my summer vacation.  At first I didn't really want to read because it was vacation time.  I started the book with little interest, but wow what a great book, or at least I thought so.  It took me a little bit to get into the book, but as the story line quickly progressed after the introduction of the ten main characters, the mystery had me glued to my reading chair.  The book is not just one mystery but three mysteries in one, who is the murder, who will die next, and the mysterious past of the main characters.  A mysterious person named U.N. Owen invited ten strangers to an  island.  One by one they were all mysteriously killed. Each murder mysteriously follows the lines of a poem that is introduced in the beginning of the book. The only murder suspects are each of the invited ten guests.  Each guest tells the story of their past and one by one they die.  Everyone suspects each other and ciaos unfolds as each guest wonders who will die next.  Agatha Christie sets up each situation, which probably would never happen in real life, and makes it happen right before your eyes.  Excitement, mystery, suspense then fill the storyline right to the end.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery and likes to solve puzzles.
0812548094|1.0|Book 2 of The Sword of Truth follows squarely in the footsteps of the first. If you loved the first book, you'll probably love this one. If, like me, you thought that the first one was a generic heroic fantasy pastiche with lots of pointless cruelty thrown in, you'll despise this one too.<br />The sad thing is that Goodkind has a fair amount of talent at jerking reactions out of people. I kept reading because I *did* become involved with the characters, and I kept hoping the overall narrative structure would go someplace interesting.<br />Word to the wise: It doesn't.
078322608X|5.0|I saw it about 10 times already. It's unbelievable, but i do find always something new in it. I would like to see it again with all my life experience growed during those 5 years, but i want to see it for the FIRST time again. This is the case where the time travel would be helpful. There is something you could call &quot;charming&quot; in this movie. The whole story is just beautiful (you'll need to watch it several times before you'll really like it however). Every single moment is something different you find attractive, (well, at least i do). I like Willis in 5th Element and in Die Hard, and in Blind Date, but James Cole by him is something special. Same is about Brad Pitt, - special starring in 12Monkeys. The quality of montage and sound editing; Cole trying to escape from the hospital- just get real drunk and try to get out your own house to understand how brilliant was this scene filmed. And the music. It's not a background - i never saw such a simbiose of the music and the movie anymore. The main theme (based on Piazzolla's Punta del Este) made me start listening and love this great composer's music. I show this title to everyone i like, and i always find a lot about the person by their reaction. Most of them like it.
B000006UNG|5.0|&quot;Colour of Spring&quot; is joyous and yet introspective at the same time, it would be one of my &quot;desert island&quot; discs. (If you were stranded on a desert island, what records would you want to have with you?)<br />   One of the fascinating things about this album is the engineering/production. If you have a good pair of headphones, or better still, a really nice sound system, this album will bring you lots of pleasure. For example, on &quot;Happiness is Easy&quot; there's a beautful children's chorus who's stereo image is about 100 feet wide. At the same time, there's a very closely miked accoustic bass, you can almost feel the pluck and bowing of the strings. In &quot;Living in Another World&quot;, which really rocks out, there's a great blues-y acoustic piano. The piano sounds like you're right inside the damn thing, listening to the hammers hit the strings. Right along side it is the beautiful thunk thunk thunk of an acoustic drum. <br />   Some people don't like this album because its too &quot;ponderous&quot;. I have never felt that way. There's always a compelling pulse in each song. There are great &quot;hooks&quot;. Mark Hollis' voice is beautiful, and the melodies are very captivating. But the thing that really elevates this album for me is all the subtle details that you may not pick up on the first few times you listen to it. I found that even after playing it over and over again for months, I was still finding new little sonic wonders hidden here and there in the music. I would highly recommend this disc, especially to artists and musicians.
0553579908|5.0|I discovered George R.R. Martin when I was delayed at an airport and went to browse through the books to see if there was anything interesting there.  &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; looked interesting, so I coughed up the money and settled down to read and wait for my plane.  I almost missed the boarding call!  I think that this series (at least, so far) is the best epic fantasy that I have ever read (possible exception being Tad Williams' &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot; - if you liked that you'll *definitely* like this).<br />&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; returns us to the world of Westeros, a land that is now torn apart by the struggles of 5 different self-proclaimed monarchs, as well as a queen across the sea who is plotting to return and claim what she believes to be her rightful throne.  At the center of the struggle are the two families Stark and Lannister.  It is an extremely complex plot, and is sometimes difficult to keep track of the huge cast of characters, but the way that the various subplots interweave to form a coherent story is absolutely fantastic.<br />Not only is the world interesting, not only is the plot complex, dark, and unpredictable, but the characters are distinct, fascinating individuals, every one.  Although the series started off with a pretty clear distinction between the protagonists and the antagonists (Stark - good; Lannister - bad), by the time &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; ends, there are no &quot;good guys&quot; and no &quot;bad guys&quot;.  I found myself sympathizing with Tyrion Lannister, rooting for Daenerys Targaryen, and getting irritated with Sansa Stark.  Sure, you still have the sneaky, scheming characters like Cersei and Joffrey Lannister, and the pure of heart heroes like Robb and Catelyn Stark, but there are so many &quot;in-between&quot; characters.  The ones you can't trust, like Varys the eunuch and Petyr Baelish.  Those who simply are loyal to whomever they are sworn to serve, like Sandor Clegane, Ser Rodrik Cassel, and Ser Davos the Onion Knight.  The knights, soldiers, and sellswords who change sides at the drop of a hat with an offer of gold or a better chance at victory.  The innocent children who don't know any better and end up as pawns in a giant game that they have no control over, like Marcella and Tommen Lannister and Bran and Rickon Stark.  And far to the north, the brothers of the Night's Watch who don't concern themselves with the struggles of the kingdom, but instead devote their lives to protecting the land from the wild beyond the Wall.<br />If you like epic fantasy, you *must* read this series.  Don't try to jump in with &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, it's way too complicated to skip the first book; go read &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, then come back to this one.  You won't regret it.
0684857219|1.0|Really, if you dont take steroids as arnold did, do you think that you could train six times a week (sometimes even with a two times a day split) without overtraining?? I was one of the stupids who thought that I could, and the result was that a did not gain even 1 grm. I spend three years of my live trining this way until I realized that I was overtraining.

B00000DR5I|5.0|Rubycon is the closest I've heard a recording come to painting pictures in one's mind.  My favorite followed by Phaedra, Force Majeure (which isn't available for some reason), and Tangram.
0060919760|5.0|Somewhere in the first Chapter of this book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer began speaking directly to me.  What I mean, is he basically summed me up as a person throughout this entire book.  It's unbelievable how we can all adopt the same neurotic thoughts and views on certain things.  Dyer knows ALL of the things that go on inside our heads and he did a damn fine job in telling us how to change these self-deflating thoughts and actions.  This book is a must for anyone lacking self-confience, or is depressed, angry, or just not living life to the fullest.  I am a better person for reading this book.  In all honesty, reading this book was probably the best thing I have ever done for myself.
B00004X01U|5.0|Wow! The second track on this CD says it all: &quot;Impressive Instant.&quot; An impressive retrograde back to her dance music days, Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; isn't as introspective as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; was, and, well, that's a good thing. Madonna has returned to her  musical roots, infusing this album with ear-catching dance beats and (there's that word again) impressive vocals. Despite the fact that professional music critics are saying Madonna lifted inspiration from Cher as far as Mirwais's use of the Vocoder is concerned, &quot;Music&quot;, if you can, uh, believe it, is wholly its own entity. There is, indeed, a touch of Bjork in there, but if anyone's to be lifted from, let it be Bjork! While the first four tracks of the disc are essentially uptempo, the remaining six all have distinct beats, some slower than others. There are ballads here, but the ballads are backed by a neo-techno beat, for the most part, with the exception of the use of an acoustic sounding guitar , in which Madonna's vocal talents are uncorrupted and shine. It's Madonna's world , we just live in it.
0786101970|4.0|The Long Walk was a tremendous book of surviors and determination.  I found the book most interesting. What the human body can indure and continue to function!  What a clever comindant wife, and the fortunate few that lived because of her.
0800199421|5.0|Harrison Ford has got to have some of the best luck of any actor I've ever seen. He hits it big with Star Wars, then continues to make amazing movies with Indiana Jones, and now as President James Marshall. I mean, how many kids have dreamed of being Han Solo or Indiana, and now they have a new character to cheer on.<br />I think this movie is so good because of the fear that this could actually happen. But the problem is that our president will probably not be a Congressional Medal of Honor recipiant despite the character Ford plays. But hey, that makes for a great plot. Who wants to see a wimpy president who can't defend his family and his co-workes when they could see somebody like Ford take out all those Russians?!<br />The story, in case you haven't guessed, is about a group of Russian terrorists posed as news reporters taking over Air Force One. They do this because President Marshall, Ford, refuses to give into terrorists demands. But when they take his family hostage and demand Ford to release General Radick, (I didn't spell that right), he has very few decisions. There are many great twists in the plot, and the action scenes are some of the best I've seen. (I hear Ford told the lead Russian terrorist to actually hit him during filming to make it look realistic.) Now if that's true, that's one great idea for a movie! I don't see Arnold Schwarzenegger doing that! <br />The music in this film is supurb, and it justs adds to the suspense. My one complaint is the dated special effects near the end, and considering they could've made them look as good as the effects in Jurassic Park, a film that came out four eyes prior to Air Force One, is kind of disappointing. But don't worry, this doesn't take away from the film. There are very few special effects shots, and they're not terrible, but just more video game like than I'd like to see. But what're you gonna do? <br />So watch this movie, or you'll be missing a future classic. Enjoy........
0393317552|5.0|If you have the slightest interest in the grand themes of the evolution of thinking and culture, this book is one of the intellectual touchstones you should include in your reading.  Diamond covers a wide range of technological, ecological, and biological topics that leave you stimulated and better informed on the factors that shaped societal evolution.
B000002OMN|5.0|This is the very first album by Meat Loaf I had ever heard. Seven years later, he is still one of my all time favorite artists. This album marked his return to the spot light after years of having been forgotten.  His first single from this baby, &quot;I'd do Anything For Love,&quot; went straight to number one on the billboards. Followed with other great hits &quot;Rock And Roll Dreams,&quot; &quot;Objects in the Rearview Mirror,&quot; and &quot;Life Is a Lemon,&quot; this album became an instant classic. It's a must have for any Meat Loaf or Jim Steinman enthusiast.
0385302320|5.0|Voyager by Diana Gabaldon is the third book in the Outlander series.  In this, the continuation of Dragonfly In Amber; we hit the open seas and set sail for tropical locations where vodoo, mystery, slavery, kidnapping and smuggling make up the plot; and of course there's the usual Jamie and Claire stuff we can't get enough of.  Very exciting reading; it reads like an Indiana Jones adventure.   We also get to see some loose ends tied up and also new questions raised that only make you say-where's the next book.  That's easy enough, the next one is Drums Of Autumn.  Once you start reading these books you can't stop.
B000002OYB|3.0|Let's face it, Jim Steinman is the main driving force behind Meat Loaf. Jim Steinman+Meat Loaf=unstoppable. Jim Steinman-Meatloaf=still doing good. Meat Loaf-JimSteinman=average to mediocre. Without Jim Steinman, Meat Loaf flat out looses a great chunk of the intensity he has while working with Steinman.  Surprizingly, Original Sin, one of the few Steinman songs on here, was one of the bigger dissapointments. He didn't have anywhere near the energy of Pandora's Box or even Taylor Dayne while doing this song. That in no way means the album was all bad. I'd Lie For You in particular is just as good as many of Meat's other songs. Where The Rubber Meets the Road, Runnin For the Red Light and Not a Dry Eye are all very well done and worth the album cost in themselves. Other songs: Left in the Dark (another Steinman dissapointment), Martha (ugh), and Where Angels Sing are better off skipped.  It's an over all mediocre album with a bare minimum of good songs to actually make it worth picking up.
0425129586|5.0|WHAT IT IS ABOUT:  It begins with ten people receiving strange letters inviting them to a weekend of fun on a strange island.  Once they all get there they become uneasy about the missing host who is unknown.  Before they are even aware what is about to happen they are slowly killed off one by one in odd ways.  The remaining ones play detective to try to find the killer until they discover how precise the killer is.  Little do they know what they have gotten into.  Read this book to find out what happens. HOW I FELT:  This was my first Agatha Christie book I have read.  I had heard many good things about it.  When I gave it a try I was very surprised.  It was better than I expected.  It was one of the best mystery books I have ever read and I read a lot of mystery books.  I would definitely recommened this book to people who love to be challenged in solving murder cases or who just love mystery stories.  You can try to solve this mystery along with all the other characters in the book.  I particularly liked how the author characterizes each person.  She shows what each person thinks as well as what he or she thought about the other characters.  I feel this book illustrates how some people take the law into their own hands.  It also shows how weak the trust between humans can be.
B0000203YT|4.0|Anyone familiar with the genuine life and works of Shakespeare will find the scenes and dialogue in this film hilarious. (I nearly fell out of my chair at &quot;Ethel the Pirate's daughter&quot; and Will on the psychiatrist's couch.) It also is an enjoyable period piece, with eye-catching costumes and some wonderful music.
068816689X|5.0|This book was so moving to me. I have read a few books on first hand accounts of the Third Reich but never by a woman.  I have never read anything like this book.  I applaud Edith and her efforts to recount such a dark time in her life.  A true triumph of the human spirit is what carried her through the war.
0783226063|3.0|Universal SHOULD Have Released The LONG Version!
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie is definately one of the most vulgar movies I have seen in quite some time, especially for an R rated movie, but it was my favorite movie of the summer, what can I say, I loved it!  The Wayans brothers are as hilarious as they were back on In Living Color, but they are not the only entertainment.  Shannon Elizabeth(Buffy) plays a great role, too bad she didn't reinact a little American Pie, but still did a great job.  As did the rest of the cast.  Some say the only funny parts are the ones that are the spoof, but what kind of movie would that make?  A little Wayans twist of humor mixed in with spoofing Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer worked great.  That's as far as the movie itself goes, but for the DVD release:<br />The DVD is being released by Dimension of course (part of Buena Vista) and at first I'm having my doubts, but most new releases they're doing a great job of transfers and features.  The problem I have is Buena Vista isn't good about announcing exact features until close to release date, so what you see may not be what you get in the end, but even if it turns out to be an almost barebones edition it's still an excellent pick-up, There's no doubt it will be anamorphic with DD 5.1, and I imagine there will be some deleted scenes with the behind the scenes.  So all in all, the DVD will look and sound great, but you won't want to buy this DVD for the quality, but for the movie itself, If you own the Scream Trilogy, The Jennifer Love Hewitt flicks, and Kazaam, this will be a great one to put next to your horror movies on the shelf.  5 stars is an understatement in my opinion, so go click on &quot;PRE-ORDER A COPY&quot; and buy Scary Movie, you won't regret it!<br />Also, A sequel is planned, so long live SCARY MOVIE!
6301174240|4.0|I have always been a Jackson 5/Michael Jackson fan and I agree with the reviews that Moonwalker is awesome.  I havn't seen the video in a few years and still remember it vividly.  My son and I were downloading music (of MJ ) and it brought back memories of Smooth Criminal and all the claymation.  This video cannot be beat for that time.  We would give it a 5 rating if it were on DVD.  Thats what we were looking for.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I was the first in line on the day this album came out, being a devoted obsessed fan. And it was more than worth the wait. This album just shows another of Bjork's many talented faces. Keep in mind that this is not really a &quot;Bjork&quot; album but rather a &quot;Selma&quot; album as the the album title explains. The music is extremely different from her previous ones, being more showtune-like. But the powerhouse tracks like &quot;New World&quot;, &quot;In the Musicals&quot;, and the duet with Thom Yorke of Radiohead &quot;I've Seen It All&quot;, made me cry, and they will probably do the same for you too. An AMAZING album to say the least.
0743200799|5.0|I NEVER write in my good books, but while reading this one, I was constantly underlining things that I wanted to remember or revisit. This fascinating book is more than just another view of our space program. It is filled with Mr. Kranz' thoughts on things such as inner courage and outward composure, staying ahead of the curve, never settling for anything but one's best in all things great and small, as well as the many noteworthy technical details of the controller's eye view of one of our nation's most courageous endeavors.  I also got from this book a metaphoric way to look at life's detours, by observation of how the mission control people had to totally rewrite the plans as unexpected things occured along almost every mission: you don't have to let the mistakes or bumps along the road throw you off, just write a new mission plan and procede from there until your goal is reached! Mr. Kranz' book also spoke of humility, thankfulness for the miracles in life, giving credit to talented hardworking people when it is their due, respect for those that you learn from, and allowing conflict, if it arises, to be just another way to hash out the best answer.  His experiences also illustrate how to learn from everything that you do and see, taking various pieces of wisdom from here and there, to make yourself into the person that you want to be, and achieve the goals that you want to achieve. You really can see his ultimate career in NASA unfolding as he gained experience from certain events that took place in his life. As for the writing style of this book, I loved it. As G.Gordon Liddy said, &quot;He writes like he talks, all heart and no B.S.!&quot;. That says it all. I got very choked up reading Chapter 22 and the Epilogue and fully agree that our country has done some awesome things, but yet now is content to ponder the past and not concentrate on charging boldly into the future and making new dreams happen.  Well, I can't say it better than anyone else who has enjoyed and reviewed this book so I'll just say, thank you Mr. Kranz for writing your book, the wait was definitely worth it! :-)
B00003CXDF|1.0|Must be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Slo-mo shots of Tom Cruise walking around doing nothing, then they repeat it from another camera angle. It all look improvised like there was no script. And how do we now the difference between the dangerous poison and the antidote? The liquids are colored red and green... ahhh of course, just so we get it right. There are many actionscenes but they are just boring and we see them in slow motion repeated from different angles all the time, like we cared. In fact if the film was played at 24 frames/second all the time and all the replays was skipped then the film would probably just be 20 minutes long. Mr.Woo and Mr.Cruise seems to try to be arty by having a white dove showing up with Cruise now and then. Of course the white dove is also filmed in slow motion. And I heard that one of the best screenwriters, Robert Towne, wrote this thing, probably just someone joking with me... All the hype on TV and in magazines just for this film, it must be one of the biggest mediajokes ever.
B00000JCOV|5.0|slipknot rules!!!! many of you have seen the cd and have dimissed it as a few guys with no real talent hidding behind masks.  well take a few minutes to listen to them, if your a fan of hard hitting fast paced music take a sec to listent o spit it out or liberrate if your into the slower but still metal music listen to tracks 15 and 13 its great, of course its not for everyone but listen toit before you write it off, these guys have some real talnet and will be around for a while.  If you aint got the disc get it
6304240554|4.0|A great sequel to Night of the Living Dead. It's not as good as Night, but it's still a classic. This time a bunch of people is hiding in a shopping mall that's eventually invaded by zombies and a biker gang. Romeros cut is a bit too long and drags down the pace, but since the film is so good it's forgiven.
B000000WF0|5.0|Amazing, outstanding, unbelievable or sensational, none of these words are discriptive enough to explain the genius of their music. It's like Richard Ashcroft is God himself, the inspiration, the sorrow, the belief, the love this album gves you in it's various tracks is out of this world. My personal favorite song of all time is &quot;THIS TIME&quot; and it's from this album, this song makes you want to break out of your body and fly away and just flow around for all eternity and enjoy hte high you get.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|This was by far the funniest movie in the world!  It made fun of every scary movie that has come out in the past few years.  You definately can't pass this one up!  Buy it now!
0881032565|4.0|I am an 8th grader and was assigned this book over the summer.  Ireally thoght this was going to be boring because all the other books that schools have givenme have been boring.  Boy was I wrong, it took a while, but this book realy unfolded and kept me on the edge my seat.  It has lots of action as well as being very suspenseful and keep you wondering what will happen next.  Ten people are invited to a lugsurious island with no one else there.  Where they all are accused of commiting murder.  Someone on th island is killing them off one by one, and that is what is so weird you dont know it is.  It keeps you guessing untill the killer is finaly revealed.  I strongly recommend this book to readers young and old who want to read a great mystery book that they won't want to put down.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Let me get my two disappointments out of the way up front.  First, the disc is only 30 minutes long; for WEA to charge as if it were a full CD or an import is the best argument for Napster I've seen in a while.  Second, this is a soundtrack, with music meant for a movie; the first track, &quot;Overture&quot;, is exactly what it says it is.<br />Those quibbles aside, it's great to have new music from Bjork again.  She's lost none of her musical quirkiness, rhythmic savvy, or lyrical playfulness; her voice, always a fascinating instrument, sounds unusually mature and controlled (maybe the influence of the character she's playing).  None of the songs here quite reach the stratospheric heights of Homogenic, which combined of-the-moment club music with traditional Icelandic song structures, and is far and away her most impressive work.  But I can think of no more beautiful moment in Bjork's recording career than the second time when she sings the refrain to &quot;New World&quot; while the drums kick in and the orchestra swells around her.  At least three songs here have similar shivery moments that almost make this CD worth its FTC-baiting price tag.<br />The duet with Thom Yorke deserves special mention.  It is, of course, a preview of great things still to come next month.  It's also a clever, haunting and instantly likable song, which prompts the question:  why doesn't truly good, serious music like this make it on to the radio any more?  This would be the slogan of my fantasy radio station:  &quot;It's ear candy ... and so much more.&quot;  That's how I've thought of Bjork ever since her &quot;Birthday&quot; days, and this sweet little morsel is no exception.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|THIS IS THE FUNNIEST COMEDY I'VE EVER SEEN.THE WAYANS BROTHERS DID A GREAT JOB.I WENT IN EXPECTING TO BE BORED OUT OF MY MIND BUT WHEN I WALKED OUT I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD I LOST MY VOICE FOR A WEEK.THIS IS A VERY RAUNCHY AND FUNNY MOVIE A MUST HAVE FOR THE COLLECTION.
0881032565|5.0|Wow! What a great book. This is my first Agatha Christie book and I loved it. She knows how to keep a reader on their seat. I don't want to give the book away but its basically about a group of ten peaople who are mysteriously invited to an island. One by one a guest dies by a mysterious murder. This is a great book and I bet you'll love it too if you read it. It may seem boring at the beginning but hang in there. I thought the book was boring at first. I had to read it for summer reading and I thought it was going to be a long book, but its the best book I've ever read.
B00004X01U|5.0|What an amazing breath of fresh air in the vapid pop world of today.  Kiddie popsters take note, Madonna is back and she has opened up a new sonic landscape. An essential CD that will take time to digest it's splendor, but expect it's influence to be around for quite a while (just like Ray of Light).  Overall, three words - brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
B000002KDS|5.0|After recovering from the left to the jaw from the Alice Cooper Group called LOVE IT TO DEATH,they deliver a right cross entitled KILLER.There is a loose conceptual thread running through the album;that of being a fugitive/outcast:from your government (HALO OF FLIES),from your lover(BE MY LOVER,UNDER MY WHEELS),from parental control(YOU DRIVE ME NERVOUS),from old west justice (DESPERADO),and modern justice(KILLER).Most of the time these flights are not successful,but they're worthwhile taking anyway. This is the heaviest ACG offering and shows Alice in top satirical lyric writing form.DEAD BABIES/KILLER continues the theatrical songwriting trend Cooper started with BALLAD OF DWIGHT  FRYE(on LOVE IT TO DEATH).My favourite track is DESPERADO on which the Coop pays tribute to the Lizard King Jim Morrison,with a spot on impersonation.HALO OF FLIES evokes the world of James Bond(of which the ACG where devotees).The thing to remember is that the ALICE COOPER GROUP were not the best guitar players and drummer in the world;however,they knew when to to deliver the short sharp songs and when to deliver the epics(unlike some guitar &quot;gods&quot; and progressive rock bands out there;you know   who you are!)KILLER was the the perfect album of 1971 and hasn't aged a bit in 29 years.This album gave Marilyn Manson the bluprint for his entire career.
B00004X01U|5.0|This album is again amazing. Picking up where Ray of Light left off, this album is more the lessons Madonna has learned than her inner emotions like ray of light. It isn't as melodic as Light, but the music gets in your blood and you like it more with every playing. Buy it. There isn't anything like it out there.
B00001QEBQ|4.0|&quot;Mulan&quot; is probably my favorite disney movie.  The animation is clear and crisp in the DVD version.  The attack scene on the snow bluff is truly awesome and thanks goes to Disney for allowing us to choose the format to view the movie, since the scene is really impressive on the widescreen.  This movie is worth the money, although I think it lacks one good love song between Mulan and the Captain at the end--- Donny Osmond singing with Lea Salonga would have been awesome!
B00003CXDG|1.0|I am writing this reveiw solely on the movie, not the DVD.  I made the mistake of seeing this movie in the theater because of my love for the first movie.  Watching this movie, I thought I was watching a James Bond movie, and I love Bond movies, but not when I go to see a MI movie.  The smothering love story mixed with the utterling annoying slo-mo filming, made me nauseous.  I love romances and see the artistic value of the slo-mo, but Woo OVER DID IT.  Rhames is the only shining light in this dim sequel and isn;t in it enough to make it worth seeing.  The other storyline, the virus, was interesting, but not that much.  Maybe its because they focus too much on the dull love story.  Unless they TOTALLY re-did the movie for the DVD, avoid this at all costs!
B00003CWL6|5.0|This move is hands down my favorite of all time. Script, acting, camera work, direction, it's all there. You must watch it if you haven't yet done so, do yourself a favor.......but only on dVd ok : ) DOWN WITH VHS!  DOWN WITH BETA!  : )

B00004S6GL|5.0|I've followed and enjoyed the work of Elliott Smith and was convinced that his eponymous second album would go down as his best ever......until I heard Figure 8. I enjoyed his musical progression on Either/Or and the drastic transformation of XO but that transformation is truly complete with this album. The Elliott Smith of Figure 8 is certainly a different one than made the haunting self-titled album but this version of him is, in my opinion, improved. The first four songs of this album will blow you away and it barely lets up from there. Happiness, Easy Way Out, and I Better Be Quiet Now are also highlights. Probably one of my top 20 favorite albums of all-time.
B000021Y77|5.0|Its a great movie but get the US DVD. I just bougth the Canadian Version don't make the same mistake<br />The Canadian Version only has the Full Screen Version, No Dolby5.1 only 2 channel, No english dubbing - not an issue for me, No Commentary.<br />It does have one more music video &quot;Wish&quot; and French Dubbing but not even french subtitles. Identify it by its different Cover
0783235380|4.0|Ben (Ben Affleck) was on his way to attend his own wedding when his plane skidded out of control.  He met Sarah (Sandra Bullock) on the plane.  They decided to hitch a ride together, posing as a couple on honeymoon.  This trip was not as smooth as they had predicted because they met with uncountable comic unnatural disasters.  The ending was not what I have thought but it was still nice.<br />This movie will make you laugh till you roll off your seats.
B00003CWOL|1.0|I think what bothered me most about this movie was that it thought it had something intelligent to say. Unfortunately a more cogent argument against religious dogma could be formulated by a 4 year old. And then there's the script. Was this a first draft? The acting was also horrendous, with incredibly annoying performances by Rock, Damon, and Affleck, but with a script like this that was inevitable. In short, do not pay money to see this garbage! Kevin Smith is a one trick pony and needs to stick to stories involving New Jersey and convenience stores.
B000002OOY|5.0|The Jurassic Park - soundtrack is a CD that means more to me than many others. That's because I've watched the movie for over 10 times when I was younger and a dinosaur fan. Then I liked to listen to it because it reminded me of the movie, which I loved. But now, as I don't really care about the film, I've started to think that this CD has really great music on it. I'm a fan of Williams, and this is, I think, one of his best works. It has incredibly beautiful and sensitive melodies (like in track 6),  mysterious and dark parts (track 3, for example) and very majestic and great moments (track 4). While you listen to this, it's easy to imagine both beautiful but frightening rainforests in which the jurassic beasts roam. Absolutely a CD every Williams-fan must have, and  a good one for everyone who likes classical- and/or movie music!
6305428220|2.0|An ironic wink too far, 'The Faculty' is neither one thing or the other. As a scary suspense thriller it's an insulting joke, one that will make you wish you had bought 'The Thing' instead. As an ironic parody of 50's 'body snatcher' films it doesn't work either - there isn't actually any irony, and the end result is that of a dull, low-budget film that would have gone directly to video without passing go if it were not for the involvement of Kevin Williamson. A year from now we will all wonder how Williamson could have had such a hold over the filmgoing public, given that his one good idea ('Scream') has been stretched to breaking-point, and that he is unable to do anything else effectively. Half-way through watching this at the cinema some drunk people walked in, shouted 'this is a stupid film' and walked out again. The DVD doesn't even have any extra bits, not that it would make the film worth any more. Interesting cast, though - Salma Hayek appears for a split-second, Robert Patrick draws a parallel between the average P.E. teacher and the T-1000, and Elijah Wood plays a geeky hero, something you don't get in most films.
0064407667|1.0|I saw this series in a local bookstore and purchased the whole set for our daughters to read on vacation.  The book descriptions on the jacket were hysterical and I couldn't wait to give them to our girls.<br />Fortunately, I was too curious to wait and read the first book myself.  What a disappointment!  While the jacket cover suggested great humor and funny books, it was anything but.  I kept waiting and waiting for the funny parts to come, but they never did.  Obviously I missed the humor that other reviewers enjoyed.  All I felt after reading book one was depressed.<br />I hate to be a party pooper, and usually, I'm the first one to enjoy silly kids books, but I returned this series of books the next day. The first book wasn't silly, even in an over-the-top way. It just missed the mark for me. I'd recommend parents read some of the books themselves before offering to their kids (especially younger kids).
B00004X01U|5.0|The new Madonna cd is BY FAR her best album to date. It picks up where Ray Of Light left off &amp; isn't the pop cheese she made before RoL. Mirwais did a fabulous job helpin out. This is where Madonna needs to stay... &amp; keep up with the amazing stuff.
B00004X01U|3.0|I am guessing that many of the albums songs will be remixed to death (like Music was) to make them palatable to dance to. I miss vintage Madonna. House music is for the pharmaceutical crowd..Hopefully for Madonna's next album she will cross back over......

0767847431|4.0|Technically a follow-up to the Harryhausen-Schneer classic \\"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\\", this Arabian fantasy only shares the title character in a new story. Although it has less stop-motion animation monsters than some of the other entries in the Harryhausen-Schneer fantasy film canon (which includes \\"Clash of the Titans\\", \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\", and \\"Mysterious Island\\"), \\"The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\\" is one of their absolute best, for three reasons.<br />1)The script. This is usually a weak element in the Harryhausen-Schneer movies, with the narrative haphazardly woven around monsters conceived before the script was written. But \\"The Golden Voyage of Sinbad\\" surprises: the script is charming and poetic, sounding exactly they way we would always like an Arabian Knights adventure to sound. Just a few lines of Koran-inspired maxims are enough to whisk you back to childhood innocence. The plot is simple but exciting, and villain Koura is a wonderful nasty. And the monsters make sense; they have a good reason to appear.<br />2)The performances. Usually in this series, actors make up part of the budget-saving: adequate at best, laughable at worst. But John Phillip Law makes a fine Sinbad: taciturn, stoic, exotic, and tough...he really matches our vision of what the legendary sailor should be. But it is Tom Baker (later to be the most famous Dr. Who) who steals the show as evil sorcerer Koura. He doesn't try to play the baddie for camp value, doesn't try to make him funny, but instead plays him as sinister and cold-blooded as possible. Great voice intonations as well. Oh, Caroline Munro is in the film, too. I don't really know about her acting, but it doens't really matter with those outfits she almost wears. You'll see what I mean...<br />3)The monsters. Each one is a clever Harryhausen masterwork. The final battle between and griffin and the centaur is fantastic, even if the griffin appears rather abruptly. But the scene with the six-armed statue of Kali is what you will remember: a symphony of flashing swords and stunning stop-motion genius. The actors deserve credit here for convincingly fighting with air.<br />Finally, all this is presented in pristine DVD widescreen. And there's a good documentary on all of Harryhausen's work, with extensive interviews with the master himself and rare footage of his test movies and failed film projects. Get this film. The kids will love it, but you'll love it even more.
B00003CXE7|5.0|this is the best movie u could ever see, it has great secial effects, great storyline, and the fastest moving movie you could ever see. this is the must see movie of the your. if you dont see this one you have no idea what your missing. even if you dont like violence and blood see it because you will enjoy everything about it. the stunning aspects of this movie will give u chills. if you dont see this movie you might as well not see any movies at all.
B00004Y62T|2.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley is a pretty poor film, although it is not uninteresting. I liked certain aspects of Ripley's character; his &quot;talents,&quot; if you will, (the ability to forge, to analyze handwriting, to mimic, to effectively and intensively make himself something he isn't.) However, these are merely brushed on and then more or less tossed aside in favor of an ambling, unsuspenseful, and often confusing plotline saturated by homoerotic undertones (and overtones, even), which are also, if interesting, rather ambiguous in nature. <br />One of the major problems is that, Ripley aside, the characters are all pretty two-dimensional and boring. Maybe &quot;two-dimensional&quot; isn't quite fair -- they have the potential to be very three-dimensional, but, let's just say that none of them are explored to the degree necessary for a feeling of real depth. Also, the casting is highly questionable. Matt Damon manages to pull Ripley off -- barely -- but he just wasn't a genuinely fitting choice for the role. I mean, is there really anything &quot;haunting&quot; about Matt Damon? Come on. I'm sure, if they had dismissed the need for a big name, they could have come up with a much more effective Mr. Ripley. <br />And Gwyneth Paltrow's character is just ... utterly uninteresting, and of all the characters, the most pointedly lacking in depth. I blame the script and Paltrow herself equally. Jude Law wasn't so bad, and Phillip Seymour Hoffmann makes the most of an underwritten bit role (still, Hoffmann is a wonderful actor who hasn't failed to impress me yet, and a big part of the reason I rented the film to begin with.) Kate Blanchett is just ... there. As is Ripley's new guy-friend towards the end.<br />The movie drags on for way too long. Odd thing to say, given that so much needed to be better-developed -- it's more a matter of time being spent poorly, than time itself. One of those films where, in every single scene for the last 30 minutes or so, you're saying to yourself: &quot;Is this it? Is that the way it's going to end?&quot; Not in a &quot;I'm in suspense&quot; kind of way -- just in a puzzled curiousity kind of way. <br />The overall feel of the movie is scattershot. Aspects of the story and of Ripley himself are quite interesting, but they just don't spend enough time or energy exploring these things. The tale rambles and the direction feels broad and amateurish -- I don't care if the guy DID win an oscar. <br />If you're interested in seeing The Talented Mr. Ripley, give it a rent -- but don't expect to have your hair blown back. The mainstream audience will find it slow and confusing, and the arthouse crowd will be annoyed with the needless gloss, bad casting, and underdeveloped script.
B00000IUT7|4.0|The batteries don't last very long and the train has stopped working after a year of minimal use. It still makes the sounds but no longer moves. I love the train but would never spend this much again.
B000003TAR|4.0|At 41 minutes and 22 seconds, In-utero better explains the reason why Nirvana works.  Not many bands today create a decade defining rock record and then crash it to pieces by creating a suicidal death-bed release to follow up.  That alone mystifies this album to brutally glorious heights.  Creepily, the devious, anguished, engrosing lyrics, make Kurt Cobain's death come as no surpsise.  Rape Me wins awards for shock fan-fare, as Kurt screams for some one to rape him amidst his fasinating gloom- ridden love for pain.  All Apollogies, Pennyroyal Tea, and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter offer the biggest cumulative sea of the exemplified lyrics nevertheless displayed with a dignified shame.  Scentless Apprentice shines with its tricky drum groove, hiatus of yelling, and wall shaking guitars.  Dumb is In-utero's biggest self-esteem clunker.  &quot;I think I'm dumb&quot; pretty much says it all for the song, upbeat with acoustics and violins in the background.  Heart Shaped Box is distilled with a grungy guitar line and possibly the strangest lyrics of the entire Nirvana trip.  &quot;I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black.&quot;  Nirvana is a great band because of a love for pain, dislike for fame, and a wish for career suicide, a cascade of features that bands today fortunately do not possess. &quot;I miss the comfort in being sad&quot;, wails Cobain on Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle.  Don't listen to In-utero expecting a clean-cut rock album in the light of Nevermind, because you're not going to get it.  Nirvana is a trademark band that fell to death under the influence of a mad collection of raw, intensely anger-provoked songs that give bad beef to the pop music industry.  Nirvana started this album, hoping to create a record that would give the fans an awful, abravise jolt to neverland, but instead, they turned up with a masterpiece in its own abusive darkness.
B00003CWTI|3.0|Of course Magnolia has a lot going for it - some excellent actors, well-written scenes, excellent camera work, and a clear personal involvment of the writer/director. However, despite all these positive elements, I still feel the film fails in its goal - being a great movie. There are several reasons for this, the most important being the length. For a three-hour movie, there isn't enough substance. The William Macy-story starts off very well, then just sits there for the rest of the film. The Tom Cruise segment has not a single surprising twist or turn, and the emotional conflict in which he is thrust seems to have no bearing on his fierce (and intriguing) misogyny. The quiz kid storyline makes its point from the start and doesn't add anything to this. And the presence of TWO people dying of cancer seems a bit much - while plausible, it looks as if Anderson ran out of ideas. (Having a 60-plus year old quizmaster die of AIDS might have been more original and thought-provoking).<br />Though this is a multiple protagonist, multi-story film, there is no juggling with time frames or deliberate confusing of the audience. In fact, it is a sign of Anderson's talent as a narrator that he can keep all the storylines immediately recognizable and easy to follow. The surrealist elements do not work for me, however. The song-singing montage made me cringe and the frog finish strikes me as silly and superfluous. I know Anderson has a to his mind solid reason for this climax, but it didn't work for me on any level, rational nor intuitive.  The music is quite obtrusive in this film - often too obtrusive for my taste. The Aimée Mann songs are typical singer-songwriter stuff - not my cup of tea, but for fans of the genre I'm sure they're a treat.  I have a strong suspiscion that Paul Thomas Anderson was totally bowled over by Short Cuts and deliberately intended to make a similar film. In some ways he has succeeded, but on the whole Altman's work is still far superior and more mature. And the grand natural cataclysm finish didn't work there either.
B00004STPT|5.0|This is the most beautiful, moving music I have ever heard. Like the movie itself, it is touching, moving you in ways I cannot describe. I am not a big classical music fan, but I love this cd, and I listen to it practically every moment of the day. I highly recommend it!
0802473156|4.0|I received this book from a friend after my &quot;model marriage&quot; had fallen apart.. I was quite impressed with the book and could relate to the many examples of couples trying to review their marriage and find the correct way to express their needs and feelings.. I have always believed that each and everyone of us are merely victims of our own upbringing, and the way you perceive love and marriage has alot to do with the example your parents provided you with.. It amazed me that Mr. Chapman based our needs on five simple gestures.. I asked myself &quot; Could it be that simple!!!&quot;.. And after reading the chapters describing each gesture I came away with a better understanding  of why &quot;yes&quot; it can be that simple.  The trick is &quot;making the effort&quot; towards your spouse or loved one and &quot;wanting&quot; to put to use the &quot;correct&quot; gesture he or she needs in order to achieve a long, healthly, loving relationship.       The only downfall of this book is one simple line in Mr. Chapman's acknowledgments..He mentions his wife of thirty some years and writes &quot; If all wives loved as she does, fewer men would be looking over the fence.&quot;  I can't understand how Mr. Chapman can write such a biased line.  In one line he seems to put fault primarily on women for the one reason their husbands seek out extramarital affairs...Personally...After I read the book I started questioning myself concerning the demise of my marrige.. I then came to my own conclusion... I feel I could of gone &quot;way beyond my call of duty&quot; and provided my husband with all the right words, gestures, moments etc,that Mr. Chapman claims we all need to survive relationships...but all my effort would not have made a difference to my husband once someone much younger entered his life and gave him what obviously meant more to him than a beautiful wife, beautiful kids, and a great life..and that was an ego..
B00004X01U|1.0|I just am not one of the fans that can follow Madonna down the trendy dance lane. She may have a good instinct for what trend to follow, but she is simply a less than seductive singer, and it is a pity that she hasn't the pipes to move some of us. All the electronica can not make the difference for me. Ray of light was a rather spiritual type of fantasy play and this one moves further into the &quot;house&quot; mentality. I ronically there are some vocal distortions and effects that seemed to be lifted from Cher's most recent ventures. I must say Cher may be less innovative, but is a more inviting personna.Music? It's up to the listener.
6302787122|5.0|I was surprised by this movie.  I thought my wife was dragging me to another &quot;chick flick&quot; but found the film extraodinary. Jodie Foster's performance in the courtroom scene is unforgetable.  The scenery and cinematography has me planning a trip to Virginia..
B00004X01U|4.0|Not surprisingly,Madonna has delivered yet another mind-blowing album that will dazzle the listener.The title track is probably the funkiest dance song she has ever done.The frantic &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; and the catchy &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; keep the party going.The slower cuts are also impressive,especially the heartfelt &quot;I Deserve It&quot;,which deserves to be a future single.Another highlight is &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;,which features great vocals.The only disapointment here is the rather silly &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; and the closer &quot;Gone&quot; isn't very distinctive.Still,the album overrall is a winner,not quite as interesting as 'Ray of Light',but still a masterpiece.
B000003S1A|5.0|Let's go back to 1981, when the Talking Heads were waking up the experimental musician in all of us, and we saw a new way of grooving to the beat.  I found myself browsing in the &quot;Alternative&quot; section of a music store.  I was looking for &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts&quot; under Byrne/Eno but somebody just stuck this album under &quot;B&quot;.  Would you believe that I bought it because I THOUGHT THE COVER ART WAS COOL?????<br />So, I bring it home, and take it out, and pop it onto the stereo.  I left the room for a second and IMMEDIATELY CAME RUNNING BACK IN to hear &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;, the ABSOLUTELY TIGHTEST PIECE OF MUSIC I'D EVER HEARD!!!  I danced, I jumped, I yelled, I raged, I slammed, I called friends to get over as fast as they could and listen to it.  I wore that album out in less than a year, and had to have the store order me another one.<br />This album opened my mind to how tight music and beat and interweaving of different instruments to make one single sound can be done.  In my opinion, it has never been matched.  This album is so perfect in its composition.  It is balanced, it rocks, it is complex, it is simple, and you can rage to it but it's also trancelike.  <br />Adrian Belew and Robert Fripp are at their highest form on this record.  It stands the test of time - I own the CD and it's a favorite of mine.  You can't go wrong.  Try it now.<br />Oh...I still think the cover art is cool.
B00004X01U|3.0|Ok...so the album is listenable...and a few tracks are almost catchy.  But it smacks of Cher's latest effort.  They've run her voice through some gizmo on track #2 that leaves it sounding like Britney Spears on a good day.  :) This album is to Mirwais what Ray of Light was to William Orbit, a good demonstration of THEIR styles.  But, unfortunately, what it highlights is that Madonna, in her own right, has very little artistic style.  Her inspiration and sound is dependent on with whom she collaborates on each album.  It is more like her guest vocals on her producers' tracks rather than making her own music.  However, she is a shrewd business woman and, for some reason, whatever she touches turns to gold in the ears of the masses.  On the other hand, Mirwais album is an artistic genius!  Listen to them both and you can hear how she has used this brilliant artist to relaunch herself into the public approval once more.  Personally, I would spend my money on Daft Punk and other bands who have been making this sound for years... but that's just me.  ENJOY!  :)
6302649943|4.0|When I saw &quot;IT&quot; after reading the book I was rather impressed. Because I have seen other book to movie creations of Stephen King Books and found this one to be the best. For example a book that was cut to shreds in the movie version was Needful Things. The book was great and to say the least I was VERY disappointed with the movie, but above all in Stephen King for allowing his book the be shredded like that!!!
B00000F1D3|5.0|The one and only does it in a big way!This set will be a seller for years to come. Cher is one of a kind. Believe is a one of a kind Single. This cd is a powerhouse with multiple singles that generate the type of excitement that only a great actress/singer can generate. Cher is an icon that always suprizes her fans with her incredible charisma and voice. This cd broke all kinds of records including Cher's oldest female number 1 on the hot 100 billboard chart. She is in great voice here. This is an accomplished artist that is everything her fans adore!Great tracks include &quot;Takin' Back My Heart&quot;, and &quot;Love is in the Groove&quot;. &quot;Believe&quot; the song sold more than any other single worldwide in 1999. Why Warners didn't push the excellent &quot;All or Nothing&quot; eludes me!Despite the lack of company push, this cd place 3 no. 1's on the dancechart and won a grammy for best dance cd. There is no other!Long live Cher!<br />***
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural IS, by far the bands best album. It lacks any kind of filler, and every song is very solid. Binaurals key feature is its ability to flow between tracks. Most of their other albums (I own them all) felt like a bunch of songs were just tossed onto a disc. This however, is a REAL album. And stands as a great album, not just a collection of good songs. This new direction is indeed an improvement from their other work. The songs have become more powerful, and more potent. Look back at Ten and you have great technical guitar playing, towering vocals, and pulsing bass lines. They have actually risen above that, and have been able to add more atmosphere and mood to the emotion often displayed on their previous albums. Experience has definitely been benificial for this group of extremely talented musicians. A must buy for any rock fan, even if you're not too big into Pearl Jam.
0553573411|5.0|Fantasy fans must check out this author.  Her plotting and characterization are superb and I tore through all three books in this trilogy in a weekend.
B00004U30D|5.0|Let me free associate a bit about American beauty. I saw many of the characters as being off track--perhaps they had forgotten who they once were.Lester had shriveled to a powerless dweeb under the the tyrannical bitchdom of carolyn. carlolyn had drifted from the spontaneous girl who once flashed traffic helicopters and faked seizures at frat parties. you can see it when Lester asks her what happened to that girl I used to know... and she drifts back to that place if for only a moment and then wigs out about his precarious beer and the 4000 dollar couch. The real estate king and Carolyn are so drunk with success and power that they are mere characictures of who they used to be.<br />I saw jane as finding herself and being willing to make her own  decisions and to choose love regardless of the social implications. She seemed to become repulsed by her friend's values. What's interesting is the central characters seem to &quot;find themselves&quot; in a space of about 90 seconds. lester's transformation was the most satisfying for me. His assertion with carolyn and the endearing midlife crisis (e.g. &quot;I rule&quot;) He of course over does it a bit with the mid-life crisis stuff, but ultimately returns to self.<br />Ricky was harder for me to peg. I am wondering if he wasn't more for the other characters to play off of. He felt very intensly. Ricky was almost injured by the beauty he saw in life, where the other characters were dead and numb to experinece His family was interesting I mean they were essentially dead. And they were such an insular family. you could see it when they all sort of panicked when there is a knock on the door and they all look at each other frightened.
0441003257|5.0|I've read Terry Pratchett before and consider him one of the funnier authors I've run across.  I had not read anything by Neil Gaiman but based on the recommendations here, I picked up the novel.  This book is... perfect for me on many levels.<br />It's funny without truly being irreverent.  While I don't believe in the Christian God, angels, demons, hell, armageddon, etc, I feel that if there _were_ such things that they'd be a lot closer to this book than they would be as taught in Sunday School.  There really is a serious message (or fifty) in this novel.  For me, it seemed to be that humans are in the end responsible for their own miseries and triumphs.<br />As a recommendation, read the prologue and if you're offended, don't bother reading.  Myself, I found the prologue indicative of the rest of the book: funny, yet with an ending that left an indelible image in my mind.
B000001Y42|3.0|The Ross Robinson produced _Three Dollar Bill, Y'all_ is not nearly as bad an album as Limp Bizkit's successive albums might lead one to believe. Although this album may not be overflowing with musical talent, it's not terrible. Some of the songs come off as being useless filler, but songs like &quot;Stuck,&quot; &quot;Pollution,&quot; and &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot; are enjoyable. However, for some good rock-rap type stuff, you're better off checking out bands like Shootyz Groove and Stuck Mojo.
B000002KJL|5.0|This is probably the finest recording Mark Knopfler ever made, and that it is indeed one of the MUST HAVE albums of anyone`s collection.  This timeless piece of blues-and-country influenced guitar work has never gone out of style.  I regularly play it for people yunfamiliar with the non-top 40 works of Dire Straits and they are amazed that it is more than 20 years old.<br />The amazing guitar licks that Mark makes sound effortless are awe inspiring, energetic, exciting and relaxing at the same time.  Mark is to J.J. Cale what Eric Clapton wishes he was.  In 22 years, I have never tired of listening to it.  Heck, even my grandmother gets into it.<br />However, I disagree with many other reviewers that Dire Straits was all downhill from here.  Sure, losing David Knopfler and more importantly Pick Withers changed the band from an old fashioned roadhouse blues band to a bonafide rock band, but it`s the quest for top 40 singles that changed the band`s image.  Industrial Disease, Money for Nothing, Walk of Life and other singles are the necessary evils of radio today. But you need only dig into each album a few tracks to find true gems that share the old Knopfler magic.  Don`t be disallusioned by what you hear on the radio.
0767819594|5.0|Well, to start with who could pass up such an awesome movie? Alright I do admit that the first time I saw this movie I didn't understand it and it seemed boring, mostly because I hadn't paid much attentions to it. I regret that now. I happen to place this movie as my number one favorite movie, it is a awesome movie full of subjects to talk about and dicuss. It does make you feel that if you are in the game of suduction you best not fall in love, because someone will try to throw you. Life in genral is like that. Being told to do something then after doing that they tell you that it tis wrong and unjust. Well this movie has changed my thoughts and opinions, I do hope it changes yours because I think Roger Kumble did an awesome job and picked a spectacular cast!
B00004U3UG|4.0|The FILM: The final part of the EVIL DEAD trilogy continues the tendency of the series, so you'll get even less gore (this time, &quot;less enough&quot; to achieve an R-Rating) and even more laughs than in part two. People looking for a scary and &quot;serious&quot; horror-picture should probably skip this, but I invite anyone else to join this great ride. If you want to play for laughs, you have to deliver and this film definitely does, you'll find yourself laughing hard many times. So, what can you expect? Well, Bruce Campbell at his best, delivering some of the best one-liners of the 90ies (quoted already one gazillion times, so I don't have to do it here), the biggest skeleton army in motion-picture history, many film-references to all kinds of movies, some great tunes by the always reliable Danny Elfman and a film-team which definitely had a good time, transferring this over to the viewer who will also have a very good time watching this. There are just two tiny bits I have to criticize: Some of the CGI-effects, especially the Introvision(TM)-castle, look rather dated and sometimes, the film tends to drag just a little bit, which is worsened by the longer director's cut, although it is far superior to the 81m-theatrical version which was a travesty.  The DISC: The image and the sound mix are good, albeit not spectacular, and a nice set of extras can be found on the disc. But I have to join in the criticism that many customers have already voiced here: Why the heck isn't the original theatrical ending included on this disc? It was wonderful in its own right and I think many people tend to agree with me here, inculding Bruce Campbell when he says &quot;Shop smart, shop S-Mart, got it?&quot;
B00004W510|5.0|The Band are undoubtedly one of the most underrated bands of all time.  And a band this talented didn't need any fancy name to call themselves.  Or their albums.  Which is why, in 1969 when they originally released The Band, true fans of music knew that they had something special on their hands.  The album was so simply recorded, which makes it interesting, because everything you hear on that album was played or sung by Band members Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel, Levon Helm, Rick Danko, and Robbie Robertson, along with the album's engineer John Simon.  This is where The Band's multi-instrumentalism comes into play.  Intricate string and horn arrangements are played by The Band and Simon.  Anyway, get this album cause it's awesome.  Highly recommended to Bob Dylan and Neil Young fans.  The remaster has 7 bonus tracks so it makes it even more worth the buck, and for you hit lovers you have &quot;Rag Mama Rag&quot;, &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, &quot;Up On Cripple Creek&quot;, &quot;The Unfaithful Servant&quot;, and &quot;King Harvest.&quot;  Not bad.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Fisrt of all...Eminem is the best white artist out there that writes his own lyrics! This CD is the best out there you can find! IF you have liked Eminem's past CD...or if you want t start being a fan...you must purshase this CD. Every song is just original and best to be played at high volumes! In the car, in your room, or even on some headphones! you will be wanting to keep on re-playing all the songs!
B000002OX7|5.0|When I purchased this CD recently I knew nothing about the Lifehouse Project and that Who's Next was the final result of the project. Lifehouse was an ambitious project, combining live concert, film and computers (Pete saw Virtual Reality 20 years before it was invented. What a visionary). The liner notes provide a complete description of the aborted project. Pure &amp; Easy was the song that planted the seed for Lifehouse and it's probably the best song that never made to a Who album. I would love to get the complete Lifehouse Chronicles that Pete is selling on his web site to understand the full story of one of the greatest ideas that never made it to fruitition at the time.
B00004Z4WQ|4.0|Saw the movie in the theater, 2nd time around. Laughed until I cried. A must see, only if you have seen 'Scream' and 'I know what you did last summer'. Most of the scenes are spoofs of the original movies. Anyone not seen those movies may not understand the real humor of this movie. However, I dropped one star because it was a lot cruder than it needed to be.<br />I will definately buy this DVD when it releases, but keep the kids away!
6305841861|5.0|The FILM: Many people consider this sequel to be at least equal to the first film and I have to agree. Ok, the freshness of the first part is gone to some extent, but the inventiveness of the filmmakers is still there in full effect and the film benefits greatly from a slightly different approach: Less gritty gore, more laughs. Bruce Campbell finally defines his charakter Ash and it is easy to understand why he is (still) so popular: It is nearly impossible not to like this mixture of a cool hero and a stupid geek that is thrown in the most hillarious situations anyone could come up with. Normally, I do not like to point out single scenes, this is boring for people who haven't seen the film and I believe that normally, the sum is greater than its parts, but in the case of EVIL DEAD II, I have to make an exception, because this scene is worth buying the disc alone: I'm talking about the &quot;laughing furniture&quot;-scene. What a wonderful piece of moviemaking and sound design, eerie, haunting, impressive, demented - and very funny.  The DISC: What could I say? The THX-certificate shows in a wonderful image (you can even choose between widescreen and full-screen) and sound mix, a great making of-featurette (not your usual &quot;hyping of&quot; with actors explaining the plot and everyone congratulating everyone) and a very informative and very funny audio commentary. Just listen to Bruce Campbell commenting on the decision of the British censors to cut the scene where he's kicked while lying unconscious on the floor: &quot;Yeah, you're not supposed to hit an unconsicous man, but chopping of heads and limps is no problem!&quot;. After all those years watching inferior video-copies of this film it is a great pleasure to watch this film in such a pristine conditon, anything less than five starts would be unfair, so DON'T MISS IT!
B00004X01U|5.0|Just like millions of other Madonna fans.  I happen to buy her 14th cd &quot;Music&quot; the day it came out (which was on the 19th of september).  I was shocked by the sounds of this album, I found it just like everyone else said, like a breath of fresh air.  It was so much more uplifting then her previous &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;.  I was also shocked that there were only 10 songs on this album, which I find rare for Madonna!  I found it a blessing, because it was jammed pack with great material and not certain songs that you want to skip over.  First came &quot;Music&quot; which is her first number 1 single since 1994's &quot;Take A Bow&quot;... This is the total Madonna comeback song, and it leads her back to her earlier days of just wanting to go out and have fun.  &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; was the following song from &quot;Music&quot;  It was a very dancey song and very fun to listen to as well as &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;.  One of my favorite tracks on this album is &quot;I Deserve It&quot;  It would sound good as a live acoustic song.  I can see Madonna wearing her cowboy hat and singing with just a mick and someone playing the guitar.  &quot;Amazing&quot; reminded me of her previous &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; which I thought was kind of tiring since the release of that song last summer.  &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; is my second favorite song from this album.  Tell me who cannot relate to this song??  &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is a very neat song, and it brings me back to her earlier 90's sound.  I don't know what it is, but maybe it's her voice in it.  &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot; is a cool song.  I think it will be a single.  &quot;Paradise&quot; reminds me of &quot;Skin&quot; which was on her &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; album.  It's very nice, i love it.  And the closing &quot;Gone&quot; It had some sort of twang in it, very country like.  I loved it!  Who ever thinks that Madonna is a thing of the past?? You better go and buy this cd!
B00000J6AG|4.0|this may be the most relaxing, soothing, calming music i have ever heard.  one of the editorial reviewers said it sounded earthy, and while i dont really know exactly what that means, it sounds right.  this is worth getting.
B00004X01U|1.0|This cd is the latest example of an artist that believes the studio is greater than a simple intelligent vocal.This is a mass market venture..again..
6305363668|5.0|A classic. Ridley Scott is one of the best directors around, and this version of Blade Runner proves it. The visuals are simply outstanding, better than alot of films that have been made in 2000.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|If Use A 4:20 Type Of Person, This Movie Is A Must Get. Fasho, This Film Is Off Tha Hook. Them Wayans Bros Has Done It Again. Imma Keep This Short Because I Dont Have The Ability To Write A Whole Book Like Some Of The Other Reviewers. I Recommened This Movie If U Want A Good Laugh, U Wont Be Dissappointed.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|This CD had potential...she's got a great pop voice, and, of course, a diva presence.  On first listen, I felt as if I could really, really like this disc.  But the more I listened to it, the more bored I got.  The slow songs are feelingless; the fast songs are great for dancing or working out, but it seems as if she's relied too much on what they can do to enchnace her sound &amp; not enough upon her own talent.  Her delivery is young &amp; inexperienced, I think she will get better, but this offering's biggest offering is its potential that she will be the diva the media hype has created her to be in the future.  The girl can sing ~ just not yet.
B00000AFGM|5.0|5 stars may be over doing it a bit, but this is a fine album.  i dont think mr manson is nearly as intelligent or unique as he thinks he is, but the man can make some fine sounding music.  it sounds quite a lot different than some of his other music but it is good nonetheless.  and to people who claim he sold out, this isnt selling out.  selling out is what happens when you make one song that is quite a bit different than what you normally make, that song is the only one to make it big, and then you completely switch genres.  for instance, sugar ray with fly.  but that isnt the point of this review.  this is a great cd.
B00004TWZF|4.0|This DVD edition marks the 4th time I've purchased this hauntingly beautiful film. You should surmise that I like it a lot. Hard to believe the man who made this calm, thoughful story also directed the frantic Fifth Element.<br />I'm afraid I'm very disappointed that the DVD doesn't make  the original score available (not even on the French language track.) Neither did earlier Laser Disc editions, but I was hoping that DVD technology would at least give me a choice. What a tragedy. So, the DVD is ejected and once again I am watching the VHS tape I recorded off Cinemax.
6300183971|1.0|Don't buy this tape, its bad. Very bad. Really.<br /> Definition of a tragedy: A great book from a great author turned into a disaster by that crazy Lynch fellow. Calling this dreck a &quot;film&quot; is too much of a compliment. Ed Wood could have done a better job (At least you can laugh at &quot;Plan 9 From Outer Space&quot;).<br />  What's really galling about this trash is that you can see all the wrong directorial turns coming in the film right before they happen. Bad dialog, marginal &quot;acting&quot; and hearing characters thoughts throughout the flick all contribute to this failure of a movie.<br />  They should take the proceeds from video sales and use them to re-make this film into something watchable. Its worse than watching paint dry. (It should get -20 stars but Amazon won't permit that)
B0000067L3|5.0|This is a two CD set.  The first CD is studio material, and the second is live.  This isn't Cream's best live or studio material, but it is still excellent, and a powerful example of how Cream sounded in and out of the studio.  <br />Like every Cream studio album, there are a couple of goofy songs.  But, these were pioneering days in rock and roll, and Cream put out four studio albums in less than 2 years.  You can't expect every song to be a classic.  The remainder of the studio songs show a real maturity and evolution to Cream's sound when compared to the two earlier albums.  <br />This CD contains an extra song (Anyone for Tennis) that wasn't on the original album.  Listen to the song and you will understand why it was originally left off.  Wheels of Fire could have been released as a single CD if this song wasn't added.<br />Although Live Cream is a better album, all of the live material on Wheels of Fire is excellent.  Some people will complain about Traintime or Toad, but that is only because those tracks don't feature Eric Clapton.   <br />Instead of buying this CD, you may want to consider the box set &quot;Those Were the Days&quot;.  It contains this album plus almost everything else Cream ever released (6 albums and bonus tracks).<br />Bit of record company irony:  The original album version came with a cool foil cover.  The cover won a Grammy award.  So, the record company plastered a big label on the album cover saying &quot;Grammy Award Winner&quot;.  When my brother bought his copy, and tried to peel off the label it ripped the foil.  Later vesions of the album came in grey.  When first transferred to CD, the studio CD and live CD were sold separately.
B000001Y2U|5.0|while this cd doesnt have as many good songs as mechanical animals, it has far more that are spectacular.  there are several songs on this cd i dont care for at all, but it is more than made up for with the great ones.  for starters, reflecting god is the loudest, hardest song i have ever heard.  without a doubt my favorite song in the heavy metal genre.  antichrist superstar also is wonderful, as is 1996, tourniquet and minute of decay.  some of the others are good, beautiful people for instance, but nothing like the others.  if you dont buy it, at least copy if from a friend.
0345350499|4.0|When my mother bought this book for me I looked at it somewhat in awe because of its massiveness.  She said it took her about a year to read it on a casual basis but it was well worth it...I have to agree.   Although I think the size of the book could intimidate the most avid of readers, the story is a riveting and refreshing look at the long lost kingdom of King Arthur and the struggle for freedom of religious belief.  The most prominent factor which sets this epic aside from other tales of Camelot, however, is that it is beautifully written from the perspective of the women both in and out of Arthur's court.  Giving a voice to the characters which are usually left on the backburner in many Arthurian legends, mainly from the view of Morgaine and Gwenhywver, was a wonderful twist of plot.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in historical epics.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I have always loved Bjork...  but now I am truly a dedicated fan of hers.  This is truly one of the best over all recordings by any artist I have ever had the pleasure to listen too.  Even though all of the songs are beautiful in everyway possible...  My two favorites would have to be &quot;In the Musical&quot; and &quot;New World&quot;. &quot;In The Musical&quot; is a very well written, witty and fun.  &quot;New World&quot; is probably one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a very very long time.  I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do.
0380973642|5.0|Well Neil- you did it again- after hooking us with the Sandman series you got us again. I must admit- that this book is not for the ordinary reader- one must have a modicum of insanity to fully appreciate the stories written therein. The stories were well written (I especially like &quot;The Murder Story&quot;) and it leaves one thinking for days on end. A good story does not end after you have read it- a good story is one that sticks to your mind, and in re-reading it- it becomes a different one from the first time you read it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie was very accurate according to Roman history and the Latin language. For example, they used the name Germania during the beginning of the movie. In Latin, it is translated to Germany. The movie also had the tiger gladiator from Gaul. Gaul is the ancient name for France. The movie was exciting and fun to watch. The acting was great and the special effects of Rome were amazing.
B00004X01U|4.0|The question after almost two decades of Madonna's music  is &quot;Why should we still care?&quot; Few artists are able to sustain the kind of creativity that makes their music vital, alive, and interesting for more than just one ot two albums. Madonna is the happy exception. She is a shrewd and smart performer who knew what it took to get her music into mainsteam acceptance. Once she accomplished that feat, she was able, over the years, to introduce more substanative, experimental and risky material, without losing its commercial viability.<br />With &quot;Ray Of Light&quot;, she reached the apex of her art, combining her penetrating lyrics with a new brand of enlightenment electronica. &quot;Music&quot; finds Madonna still full of creative juices, still aiming for the heart, and, by and large, succeeding. The electronica experiment goes one step further, but Madonna never loses sight of what good songwriting is: a strong melody and lyrics that speak to the soul, elevating electronica beyond the mundane. Madonna states very clearly in the final cut on the CD entitled, &quot;Gone&quot; what will happen when she can no longer create music that matters:....&quot;turn to stone, lose my faith...I'll be gone before it happens&quot;
B000002LTU|2.0|the rapping of Easy Mo B does.
B00004X01U|4.0|I'm a bit torn on Madonna's new CD. The first two tracks really rock, but the rest of the album is a tad mellower. All in all, I'm glad I bought this. Madonna continues to do things her own way, no matter what and you have to respect that.
B00003CXE7|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was hooked. I couldn't wait til it came to theaters. When I saw it I thought it was a very good movie probably the best epic I have seen in a long time. The story was great and so was the acting. There was edge of your seat thrills and a tragic end but overall this movie tops my list of being the best movie this year.
B00003CXE7|5.0|THIS IS A WONDERFUL MOVIE THAT EVERY PERSON SHOULD SEE.  IT IS A STORY THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT OUR WORLD'S PAST.  IF YOU HAVE YET TO SEE THE MOVIE...<br />...SEE IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
B000002JSN|5.0|It's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said dozens of times about Led Zeppelin especially since every classic rock radio station has adopted them as the default number one band of all time.  Every September becomes &quot;Zeptember,&quot; &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; always tops any song list covering rock and roll (okay, except that VH-1 list), and you can not go through one day of listening to a rock station in America without hearing at least one song from the fourth album.  Regardless, you can't hold that against this band.  &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; does a remarkable job of combining all the best ideas this quartet has conceived and puts it together in a balanced and thoroughly enjoyable two-disc piece of rock and roll.  Perhaps because the entire fourth album is overexposed many nuggets of brilliance remain unearthed on this effort, most notably &quot;Night Flight,&quot; &quot;Sick Again,&quot; and &quot;The Rover,&quot; which is my favorite Zeppelin tune of all time.  No doubt, if you are one of the few un-Zepped folks out there, you'll pick up the fourth album first because of the hits.  I ask here that you make a detour and pony up a little extra cabbage for this recording.  Besides being their best, you can always hear &quot;IV&quot; on the radio anytime you want.
B00004TDRD|4.0|I still have mixed feelings about this movie. When I first saw it - on TV, in about 1985 - I was 9 years old. Having seen it, I immediately (together with my friend) loved those fascinating, majestic fish - sharks. I started reading, learning and collecting everything I could find on sharks. I learned their Latin names, even though, obviously, I didn't speak Latin yet! I filled many copybooks with my notes, my drawings (and I *could* draw :), sketches and cutouts - everythingI still have mixed feelings about this movie.

I filled many copybooks with my notes, my drawings (and I *could* draw :), sketches and cutouts - everything I could find on sharks (And the task wasn't so easy for a 9 year old - these were 1980s and it was not USA with its superb libraries available!) I was fascinated by sharks - to this day they remain among my favorite animals and remember everything about them, even though I'm as far from biology and zoology as can be! And then I learned that most people's reaction to &quot;Jaws&quot; was not admiration and respect for those wonderful creatures that sharks are, but fear and hatred! I was shocked - how could anyone hate sharks? I was sure everyone would realize how false the very idea of &quot;Jaws&quot; was, and understand that the movie is nothing but a 100% untrue, unrealistic fairy tale with horror elements - a modern Brothers Grimm equivalent! But obviously, many people believed it and as a result, supported the criminal idea of killing sharks. What a sick thing to do, I thought! Couldn't they separate the truth from the movie? Didn't they know how fabulous and actually not at all aggressive toward humans sharks had always been? Apparently, they didn't... and many grew to hate sharks *because* of &quot;Jaws&quot;!<br />To sum it up - I think I would give the movie 5 stars for its value entertainment and 0 stars for what it did to sharks. My final verdict - four stars. *Only* for its entertainment value. As for the advice, I would tell you to read a few good books on sharks and watch a few good documentaries before seeing &quot;Jaws&quot;, especially if your opinion on sharks is not favorable.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  The songs have either a trance-like quality, like Bjork's earlier &quot;Isobel&quot; or &quot;Hyperballad,&quot; or a show-tune quality like &quot;It's oh so quiet.&quot;  These are my favorite two Bjork song styles.<br />I don't pretend to be a music critic who can use words like &quot;postmodern&quot; and know what he's talking about, all I know is this: Few pieces of art have the ability to transport me away from my daily life and make me forget my troubles.  This CD is one of them.  The music is both calming and uplifting.  There is beautiful imagery in the lyrics and beautiful melodies in the music.  I wish the CD could be twice as long!
6305750750|5.0|What a great movie, one of the best 4 of all time (The other 3 are episode IV,V, and VI), but where is the DVD??.<br />I was so frustrated when I heard that this movie was going to be available on VHS only, and get even more frustrated when I heard that in november Foxvideo is going to release episode IV,V and VI in vhs AGAIN.<br />Please George Lucas this is the time of digital technology and Star Wars fans wants to upgrade.<br />Many people made a great investment in big screen tv's or triniton wega, dvd players and a great sound systems like dolby digital, dts and in some cases THX. Can you imagine how disapointing has to be for this peaople watch this movies in a poor video and sound vhs quality.<br />It's true that Lucas wants to make a special thing with the DVD of this movies and he doesn't have time for work on it right now, but after he finished episode I, he started to work on episode II imediately,and I belive that he would do the same with episode III, so when where going to have the DVD version of this movies in 2005 or 2006??? please I don't think that star wars fans can wait for so long
B00003CX7L|5.0|This movie was much better than original - though that was good too!  Animation has improved, characters can be sympathised with, they've managed to get out of the shadow of the first film, and it's good for kids, adults and teenagers alike.  A really good film.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Am I the only one who found this movie to be VERY slow and much too long? People talk about &quot;Gladiator&quot; like it's some slam bang action picture. The trailer sure made it look like one, yet everything in the trailer came from the last third of the film. Every scene in the first half of the movie is so protracted I had to stop myself from yelling, &quot;GET HIM IN THE COLISEUM ALREADY!&quot; The film is well structured and a good story but there's not enough meat on this bone for a film well over two hours. And so it feels s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with pretty visuals, pretension and unnecessary talk-talk-talk. If we could get a 90 minute cut of this on the DVD set, I'd buy and treasure it. Until then, I'll keep watching &quot;Braveheart.&quot;
B00004X01U|5.0|I am one of those big Madonna fans who ran and got a copy of Mairwais' Production on import (the U.S. edition isn't out until January, but you can get Production on import here) in April to see what the new Madonna sound was going to be like. <br />After living with Production for 5 months, listening to it's amazing intricacies in what seems such simple music, and Mirwais' work with Madonna on her album &quot;Music,&quot; I've decided that one album is incomplete without the other.<br />The songs on Production and Music reference each other both musically and lyrically. For example &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; on Music and &quot;Naive Song&quot; on Production both utilize the &quot;CD&quot; skipping technique making you think your CD is skipping when it's not especially with the folk guitar, one of Mirwais favorite effects.  <br />Do you like that beat on the title track of Music? It comes from &quot;Never Young Again&quot; on Production.<br />Paradise (Not For Me) is featured on both albums, in different forms. I tend to think that the Production version is a little bit tighter where the Music version sprawls unnecessarily.<br />Simplicity and to the point are the word of the day on both Music and Production. While this may be a great ideal, in reality it just leaves you wanting a lot more. Listening to both albums back to back gives a real sense of completeness. <br />I advise to get both albums.
B00004WKII|4.0|This brand-new box set has a large amount of great Hendrix material, whether new or unreleased. Some of the songs on it are utterly fantastic, such as the &quot;Room Full of Mirrors&quot; and &quot;Spanish Castle Magic&quot; on disc three. The set becomes progressively better, and the majority of the songs are terrific.  The only problem with the set is that some of the &quot;alternate&quot; takes sound nearly exactly the same as the finished studio version. The first disc definitely suffers from this - &quot;Foxey Lady,&quot; &quot;Highway Chile,&quot; and &quot;If 6 Was 9&quot; all sound identical to the versions I have already bought and heard. However, this is a small price to pay for the wealth of kickin' material that is on this set. One request - more live songs. Some of the live tracks start fading when Jimi starts moving into another song, which sounds wonderful even as it gets softer and softer. Why didn't the producers put that next song on the album? Either way, at the 30%-off price Amazon has now, this set is definitely worth it for the big Hendrix fan.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|One of the better war films to come out of Hollywood, &quot;U-571&quot; follows an intense and gripping storyline that delivers the goods to even those who don't follow the war film trend. Under the direction of Jonathon Mostow, who also directed the thriller &quot;Breakdown,&quot; the film contains a stellar cast that knows what it's doing and superb visual and sound effects that add to the atmosphere of suspense. <br />While on a 48-hour leave from duty, Lieutenant Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey), along with his crew, are stripped of their leave and given a new objective to follow. Their mission: to impersonate German soldiers, sneak their way onto the German u-boat U-571, and capture the Enigma, the decoder for the secret code tha is used by the Germans to search and sink opponent submarines. Their mission is a success, only until their own sub is destroyed and the US crew is trapped in a German sub in hostile waters. Now it is up to Tyler and his crew to make sure that the Enigma reaches the hands of the American authorities without allowing the Germans to realize that is has been stolen; otherwise, the mission is a failure. <br />The film follows all the classic paths of previous war movies, especially that of &quot;Das Boot,&quot; but the subject matter and performances by all of the actors give it a style all its own. Matthew McConaughey is superb as Tyler, who must take charge of the confused crew in the many instances of peril which accompany the mission. The supporting cast, which includes Bill Paxton, Harvey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi, also adds much to the plot and the action. Director Jonathon Mostow uses his talents as a director to make this film one of the best films of the summer of 2000, not to mention one of the better war films ever made. <br />Visual effects in this film are excellent, made believable and exciting all at the same time. Sound effects prove, at times, to be very effective in the storytelling, especially in scenes where explosivesand gunfire are put to use. All-in-all, the film is a nice package of likeable characters, interesting story, and wonderful execution.
6305320802|3.0|I found the THX laserdisc to be a superior picture to the DVD, which has a bit too much &quot;shimmer&quot; to it. I believe the color shifting WAS on the laserdisc, though. As a side note for SOUTH PACIFIC fans, the DVD of that film is much better than the THX laser, which had far too much color bleeding.<br />As someone interested in film history I'd like to see a special edition that includes both the TODD-AO and the Cinemascope versions of OKLAHOMA.  A comparison of cinematography and performances would be fascinating. <br />The musical does show its age in its sparse plot, but the music, and particularly the ballet sequence, make it still worth watching, as well as some of the performances. Charlotte Greenwood still sparks the screen as Aunt Eller, and Graham has some fun moments, too.
0788821075|1.0|For ten years I avoided this until now-- I should have waited.  A romantic comedy without the romance or laughs.  I am not a big Roberts fan, and she is terrible here.  Leave it to Hollywood in the era of AIDS and STDs to make prostitution seem glamorous, and how a hooker with a heart of gold can change one of those jerk billionaires who is ruining it for the rest of us.  So much of the film took place in the hotel suite, I thought I was watching some kind of nightmarish stage play.  You may not like this review, but I sure did not like this film.
0763611883|5.0|Lola is a VERY picky eater.  Carrots are for rabbits.  Peas are too small and too green.  She won't touch potatoes or mushrooms, spaghetti, eggs or sausage...the list goes on and on.

Her big sister Charlie has got to give her dinner and decides &quot;to play a good trick on her.&quot;  Carrots become orange twiglets from Jupiter and Lola is so intrigued that she just has to try one.  Peas turn into green drops from Greenland, mashed potatoes, cloud fluff from Mt Fuji.  And though Lola would never touch a fish stick, she's willing to eat an ocean nibble since mermaids eat them all the time.  Pretty soon, dinner is over and Lola has eaten everything, even a nice round red moonsquirter.  You know, they're her favorite.  Lauren Child has written a funny, witty, imaginative story, told in hip kid-speak, all picky eaters will identify with.  Her busy, expressive illustrations, full of color and textures, compliment the text and will really hold your youngster's attention.  This is a terrific book the whole family can enjoy and it might even get your picky eater to try something new.
B000001FQQ|3.0|Okay, having stumbled off the KISS bandwagon from &quot;Asylum&quot; (abysmal) until &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; (laconic nights), I have to admit I picked this up because I had heard 'Forever' on the radio, and I liked it.  A skeleton in my closet?  Hardly; even if it WAS cowritten with Michael Bolton, it was a huge hit because of it's bitter acoustic binge, tight harmonies, and just plain decent lyrics (as far as KISS goes).  The rest of the album is hit and miss to the extreme, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br />Eric Carr's lead vocal debut on 'Little Caesar' doesn't deserve it's lowly b-side status.  It's far better than Paul's 'Read My Body', and more raucous than 'Hide Your Heart', one of the lead-off singles (actually, Ace Frehely had a more eventful cover on his &quot;Trouble Walkin'&quot; album, released the same year--check it out!).<br />'Caddilac Dreams' is marginal, 'The Street Giveth...' is somewhat better, and 'Rise To It' could benefit from some rougher production.  'Boomerang' is a complete throwaway, as is 'Silver Spoon'.<br />Roundly disclaimed by both Gene and Paul in subsequent years, it would have been a four-star album had they simply streamlined the tracks, and gotten rid of the filler, which makes the good songs look that much worse.
B000002U94|4.0|Bob Seger first came onto the music scene in 1969 with the song &quot;Ramblin Gamblin Man&quot;.  After that suprise hit, he released numerous albums that were commercially flops, but he made a name and built up a strong follwing as a road warrior.  Years on the road helped hone his craft and he became a great showman.  These skills show up in the 1976 live album &quot;Live&quot; Bullet, which was his commercial breakthrough.  After that he wracked up huge sales with the releases of Night Moves, Stranger In Town &amp; the number one album Against The Wind.  Much of Nine Tonight is made up of the best songs off those albums.  While Nine Tonight isn't as strong as &quot;Live&quot;, it still is a great snapshot of Seger's concert skills.  The studio versions of &quot;Fire Lake&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Nights&quot;, &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Never Forgets&quot;, &quot;Night Moves&quot; &amp; &quot;Fire Down Below&quot; are already great and they get a little extra kick here.  The best song on the album is a cover of an old R&amp;B number &quot;Tryin' To Live My Life Without You&quot; which is tailor-made for Seger's gravelly vocal style.  While he has made some great studio albums, Seger is still at his best on the stage and Nine Tonight gives you the best of both Seger worlds.
B000001EL7|4.0|Ahh, I have fond memories of this one.  When I was 7 years old, my brother picked it up for my birthday--my indoctrination into the KISS army, and merely the first of many I'd pick up years later.<br />In retrospect, it's easy to see why the critics hated KISS.  They weren't artistic, they certainly weren't virtuoso musicians, and they hit with the subtlety of a cannonball (&quot;Plaster Caster&quot;??? please...).  But as with the Ramones, you either got the joke or you didn't, and I sure got this one.<br />It's far from their best album, and compared to the &quot;Alive II&quot; versions, it sounds a bit tinny, regardless of the remastering.  But KISS tunes were made for covering, and these comprise the cream of the crop--&quot;Christine Sixteen&quot; is a lech's paradise, the title track is an air guitarist's delight, &quot;Shock Me&quot; is Ace's justified crown jem on the album, and &quot;Almost Human&quot; is a Gene tour-de-force a la &quot;God of Thunder.&quot;<br />Between &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot;, &quot;Destroyer&quot;, &quot;Love Gun&quot; and select tunes off the solo albums, this particular tripych is totally interchangeable, and still remains underrated classic US rock at its best.
B00004TRD8|1.0|I own t2 on dvd and vhs (the original releases). Now after a month I bought it on dvd, I hear a new version is coming out with 3 versions, commentaries, etc. my feeling is, if you already own it on dvd, why spend your hard-earned money on another version? it is the same picture-sound quality! I have seen this done on several other movies. I understand having dts and DD versions, but to treat movies like software is stupid. It was stupid of me to buy even two versions, but 3? c'mon. if you don't already own it on dvd, go ahead and buy this version. if you do, please don't buy this. you will show the studios you'll buy anything in a shiny package. I think this is a terrific movie, but i bought a dvd player for the picture/sound, not watching different trailers once or twice in every new version that comes out. If you don't own this already, it's a good buy. if you do, you are wasting your money, how often are you going to watch a featurette anyway? stick to your basic version.
0517123207|5.0|This book is an eloquent, easy to follow argument that has been lampooned, caricatured, and feebly argued against from all sides. But Darwin's basic argument makes good sense and can be seen to work in the wild. The argument is that if an animal, a biological system, can exist in an environment, it will do so, and it will multiply as a result of its fitness for that environment. If it cannot, it will die. That's pretty much it. Put a camel in Antarctica and it will die. Put a polar bear in the middle of the desert and it will die. Easy, huh? Over time, those undesirable traits (from a survival standpoint)in a given population will be bred out, either slowly or quickly. They have to be! Otherwise, the species dies! Voila! Evolution theory! They made us read this in Biology 4560, and I'm glad they did. A necessary read for anyone who strives for any modicum of scientific literacy.
B000001ELL|4.0|1979 was a year of mixed emotions for KISS.They each released debut solo albums on the same day with less than phenonimal results the previous year.They also starred in their own TV movie KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park. The ratings weren't record breaking.But for some strange reason it was the second highest rated TV movie of 1978.<br />KISS decided that 1979 was the year for regrouping and returning to true form.On the advice of Peter Criss,Vini Poncia was hired to produce their next album(a previous meeting with Giorgio Moroder went nowhere).Dynasty was released in May of the same year.It quickly climbed to #9.Their fourth top ten album and their fourth platinum.Likewise with Double Platinum(see review) the previous year,it also helped dispel rumors that they were breaking up.<br />Aside from producing,Vini also co-writes three songs(I Was Made For Lovin'You with Paul and Desmond Child,Sure Know Something with Paul and Dirty Livin' with Peter and Stan Penridge).Paul solely writes one(Magic Touch).Gene also solely writes one(X-Ray Eyes)and co-writes another(Charisma with then business manager Howard Marks).Ace also contributes two more(Hard Times and Save Your Love)on which he also sings lead.The cover tune is 2,000 Man.<br />It also features some strong songwriting.In retrospect,some of their best.I Was Made For Lovin'You has Paul singing to a woman that they were made for each other.Sure Know Something has Paul teling a woman that she's the best thing that's ever happened to him.Hard Times is one of Ace's best.This song exemplifies that while Ace never wants to go back to the hard years of his past,he also shows that those hard years are the reason why he's still around and still stronger.Dirty Livin' has Peter sending a message to himself to break free from the fast and dangerous rock star life that was tormenting him(It would also be his last time with the band.He left KISS after the Dynasty tour.He wouldn't perform with the band again until the reunion).The remainder of the original songs are as well written as their previous songs.They are in the typical KISS groove but seem tamer than their previous songs.<br />The remake of The Rolling Stones classic 2,000 Man is a stellar performance by Ace.He turns in his best vocal effort to date. He also gives this song a style as well as a flair that would even make Mick Jagger &amp; Keith Richards jump for joy.<br />Poncia captures the band in its true rocking spirit.Despite the disco tags that this album has earned over the years,this really isn't disco in the true sense.It's actually power dance pop successfully mixed with KISS's brand of thunder rock.He successfully creates a &quot;FUN&quot; album.Poncia deserves an A+ for his efforts. Likewise,each of these songs are rock and roll party tunes.They are also unforgettable.When you put this CD in your CD player,you'll have a rocking good time.This album is even better than Strutter '78 on Double Platinum.Once again,an A+ for Vini Poncia.<br />So KISS fans everywhere.Pick up Dynasty and rock your rolls right off.No fans music library is complete without it.
B00004STW3|2.0|What a bizarre and campy sci-fi scare flick with some real morbidity thrown in! So do you think I would really find humor in victims getting slowly turned into brightly colored skeletons by those hideous invaders with their death rays and their families ended up bawling at their funeral - even if they happen to be trailer-dwelling rednecks??? And think severed fingers, hands, and heads are really funny at all? One amusing moment, however is when some big-wigged bimbo goes prancing into some guy's house to seduce him with a few grisly scenes thrown in. Not to worry, though - such ugly creatures with those bulging eyeballs and pulsating brains eventually get just their desserts after a whole reign of inducing death and terror on the poor innocent humans, however cartoon-like they may be. A real wacko circus show for the sci-fi ape, nevertheless!
B00004X01U|5.0|WOW, WOW, WOW!!!!!!!  I have been a Madonna Wanna-be since she first arrived on the music scene.  How wonderful that she has finally gone back to the dance music roots that she came from.  I couldn't sit still due to the funky beats of the songs.  Even on the acoustic ballads, she still retains the edge that makes her the One and Only!!!!!!!
0679720200|5.0|I read this novel twice.  The power of this fiction is the character keeps heading toward disaster and you want to pull him back to a safe path but you cannot.  And that is quite frustrating.  That is what makes for great fiction--something that upends the emotions. The novel is set in Camus's native Algeria.  He is better know as one of the founder's of the existentialism philosophy which I cannot understand and, consequently, cannot explain.  I also read halfway through Camu's autobiographical novel &quot;The First Man&quot; and readl all of his world war II &quot;Troubled Sleep&quot;.
B000001FXR|5.0|The Wailers had grown up in the music business in the 60's recording rocksteady, ska, and rude boy anthems like Peter Tosh's &quot;I'm the Toughest&quot; for Leslie Kong and Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. It was Perry who helped the Wailers get their collective reggae footing and with him they recorded early versions of many famous hits to come, then were signed by Island Records and they set off to record a proper debut lp.<br />That debut lp is &quot;Catch a Fire,&quot; arguably one of the most, if not THE most, important reggae lps ever made. The trio of Tosh/Marley/Bunny Wailer never sounded better, and the songs they sung were pure magic, from the opening organ chords on &quot;Concrete Jungle&quot; to the closing codas of &quot;Midnight Ravers.&quot;<br />The songs mix beautifully the Wailers' social conscience (&quot;Concrete Jungle,&quot; &quot;Slave Driver,&quot; Tosh's haunting &quot;400 Years&quot; and his &quot;Stop That Train&quot;) with guarded hope (&quot;No More Trouble&quot;), and their down to earth homespun rude boy sensibilities (&quot;Kinky Reggae,&quot; &quot;Stir It Up,&quot; &quot;Baby We've Got a Date&quot;). The results are a relatively balanced sonic attack.<br />The rift that would split the band was also underway during this lp, with Marley's less abraisive songs dominating the bulk of the lp, with Tosh's more militant songs only represented twice. Tosh would leave the Wailers after their next effort.<br />But for now, what is in front of you is a supreme album for the ages- dark and brooding throughout (save &quot;Stir It Up&quot;), and a wake-up call for all who listen to it. A gift from Jah Himself, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is a necessary component of any decent music collection, no less reggae collection. An absolute, no brainer, must have. Period.
0140187863|5.0|The story of a fallen woman with a theme similar to Flaubert's &quot;Madame Bovery&quot; which I have also read.  This novel was actually banned I believe because of it's open discussion of the adulterous wife and her passionate love affair.  Another theme in the book is the life of the leisured class.  These were squires, Lords, Earls and other titled persons who lived lives unencumbered by the need to work.  Today's Internet millionaires don't know when to quit.  They should walk away from work to pursue hunting duck, quail and pheasant on their large estates.  Some of them would also pursue gardening, literature, and painting.  The world would be a richer place.  Imagine if Picasso had a job: we wouldn't have Les Desmoiselles D'Avignon.  Surely that would be a pity.
B000001FY7|3.0|&quot;Kaya&quot; is a transitional album for the Wailers between the unabashed reggae of their early releases, and the slow yet steady move towards mainstream pop music with a reggae twist-&quot;Survival,&quot; their next lp, would complete the transition.<br />For fans of Marley, the lp causes disagreements. For hardcore fans of the original Wailers or who identify with Bob's political songs (myself included), &quot;Kaya&quot; is more or less a dispensible lp of feel good fluff. For other fans, they can identify with the feel good style of this album and with the positive messages that it gives out, and that is good enough.<br />Whichever side one takes (if a side need be taken at all), the songs on the lp, including the beautiful &quot;Is This Love?&quot;, shows the very tender and free spirited side of Marley that permeates many of his later, more commercially oriented, songs. <br />Politically oriented fans will still appreciate the songs but will be ultimately disappointed by the lack of politicism on it. The rest of the fans will just enjoy it. For me, I think the lp is weak despite the good songs, and way too slick and commercial for my tastes. Give me &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; any day of the week and I am happy.
6305922756|5.0|...I could go into a long-winded explanation as to why you should see THIS IS SPINAL TAP but I won't. Just see the movie &amp; you'll understand why everyone has declared it one of the great comedy films of all time! It's one joke after another...&quot;armadillos in our trousers&quot;...getting lost in the basement on the way to the stage in Cleveland...having to open for a jazz festival/magic show...&quot;smell the glove&quot;...the stonehenge model...on &amp; on! Great stuff..!!!
B000002IG4|5.0|WOW!! How to describe this album he is so angry but then again so good, he has to have the biggest heart for music cuz i know if i just got divorced then i would not be writing an album.. He is amazing he has like 3 of his all time hits, I Dont Care Anymore especially he sounds so angry and u can tell by the drums and the tone of his voice, its amazing try this album, u wont regret it because its worth the 10-15$ that it costs. Trust me i know
B00003CWOL|3.0|Watching Dogma is like hanging out with college kids eating pizza, smoking pot, and talking about religion; that is to say, it may be entertaining, but it's not particularly profound, intelligent, or well thought-out.  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon work well together, and it's pleasant to watch their chemistry.  If that's enough to make you want to watch Dogma, by all means: go, see, be entertained.  Just don't expect a whole lot more.
B000002UA9|5.0|This is an awesome album! These guys could do anything. What makes Please Please Me even more amazing is when you consider the time when it was released. No one at that time was creating music so fresh and original. The Beatles simply blew away their contemporaries. No one at that time (in popular music) had the musical chops that these guys had. Many dismiss The Beatles' early years as &quot;Bubble Gum&quot;. No Way! Tracks like &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and their cover of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;, flat-out rock! Their non-rock song are equally impressive. This first effort by The Beatles is a true treasure!
B00001P4RI|5.0|I was given a recorded tape of Brendan Perry's album &quot;Eye of the Hunter&quot; about 6 months ago. When I first heard it, I was absolutely fascinated and appreciative of Brendan's voice. He has the most beautiful voice I have ever heard in my whole life, as does Lisa Gerrard. What a pair these made in the Dead Can Dance days! I must confess I am in love with Brendan's voice and have been for a long time. Recently, I encountered two people who also shared my feelings. It is nice to know I am not the only one absolutely **SEDUCED** by this album's lyrics and this heavenly man's voice.
B00003CXDG|3.0|Plot? Who needs a plot with this movie. This movie requires that you suspend disbelief, hop into your seat, buckle up, and just have fun. If I want plot there are plenty of other good movies to select from. But if I want a roller coaster ride, I'll take this movie. I give it a 1 for storytelling and a 5 for fun.
0345347951|2.0|This \\"classic\\" was a disappointment. First the events were too fantastic, too far fetched even for science fiction and too hard to swallow,..etc. Again and again through out the book, Arthur demonstrates that he has this British Empire superiority complex. He assumes that measures of human progress include such things as everyone on earth speaking English, that ALL religions are the same and that London is the jewel of Europe and therfore, the world. On the whole, I found the book irritating despite a clearly sophisticated writing style.
0875847706|5.0|A seriously fun, deeply insightful book illuminating the principles of creative leadership.  As applicable in the professional restaurant kitchen as in the corporate boardroom, its lessons are sure to resonate in different yet powerful ways in the personal and professional lives of all who have the pleasure of reading it.
6302914213|5.0|These are the final five episodes of the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; series; they are somewhat of a redemption after some weak episodes immediately preceeding these.  The plots are much stronger, especially those focusing on Agent Cooper.  His attraction to Annie Blackburn is nicely played (with a strong romantic piece by Angelo Badalamenti).  The Windom Earle plot becomes intriguing as it becomes bigger than Earle (who is overplayed by Kenneth Welsh) and delves into the supernatural (and, as mentioned in another review, becomes an inspiration for the X-Files).<br />The other plotlines are also strong.  Especially intriguing is the Andrew Packard character, as he (along with Catherine and Pete) deals with the mysterious black box.  Dan O'Herlihy has a great stage presence as Packard; I wish he could have been featured more in the series.<br />The build up to Episode 29 is nicely done -- Lynch's direction of the final episode has that first season feel to it (though a little darker).  It would have been a great season-ending cliffhanger (I would have been interested to see if Major Briggs went to the rescue at the Black Lodge), but remains an odd end to the series.  <br />For these espisodes, the only major complaint is that they deserve to be on DVD.  For the future, I would love to see some sort of continuation of the story nearly ten years later.  It would be fun to have a Lynch/Frost/Chris Carter collaboration on a movie combining &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; with the &quot;X-Files.&quot;  It probably won't happen, but this series deserves more.
B00004Z4UW|5.0|To put it simply The Matrix is a special effects laden Sci-Fi film. Although the Special Effects and action sequences are great, they are very little compared to the films great script and acting. The best performance in it comes from the comic relief provied my Mouse(matt doran. Mouse never shuts-up, but in the procces of talking, poses some interesting questions. The Matrix is one of the few Sci-Fi films I have seen that is enjoyed by non-sci-fi fans. So what if all Keanu reeves does is look confused? that's the point. So what if the end is predictable, that just sets it along with Star Wars as a modern day myth. --This text refers to  the DVD edition.
6305282927|4.0|To tell you the truth, I haven't really seen many musicals from the 50's! I'd been too busy watching ones from the early 80's!  <br />I didn't hire the video until after I saw the musical performed on stage in the modest little town of Wangaratta, Victoria.  I loved the show, the music and the story, so naturally I thought I better check out the vid!<br />I think it actually works better on stage.  The actors were better able to gauge the audience's reactions and play on that.  Plus, they sang &quot;Oklahoma&quot; about five times due to the encores!<br />Of course the movie is also gorgeous though and I'm definitely gonna hire out more musicals from that era, and of that ilk.  It made me wish I was a local yokel living in Oklahoma... spending my days singing and trying to encourage the farmer and the cowman to get along!  The jokes are very cute. Nothing much really happens, yet you find yourself on a fun and intriguing ride that leaves quite a smile on your face!
1556587864|2.0|This movie was extremely overrated. Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were neither one convincing in their roles. The star of the show, I feel, was Jeanne Tripplehorn. She was the only believable character and her brilliance was what saved the film. The film's only other redeeming quality was the casting of the guy who played Newman on Seinfeld.
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie is worth the price just to get to watch Keanu Reeve's mouth disappear! :-0 / :-o / :-
0140282033|5.0|When I finished this delicious novel I thought --what a treat! It is a lovely story , beautifully written and composed, with a touch of mysticism. Vianne Rocher has seemingly magical powers when creating chocolates in her shop, and also when she affects the lives of the people in the small French village into which she has settled with her young daughter.<br />I bought this book last year during Lent, which plays such a large part in the book. It is when Vianne goes head-to-head with Father Reynaud and the power of the Catholic church as he administers it. I especially liked the way Vianne quietly defused Reynaud by just being her gentle self.<br />The author competently tackles the issues of spousal abuse, prejudice (social rather than racial), religious intolerance, and the problems of the aged, both mental and physical. Yet the book is never preachy.<br />The life in this village was so old fashioned and quaint that I was jarred back to the present day when things like computers and laser-eye surgery were mentioned. It was seemingly taking place in another time.

B00004X01U|4.0|In 1992, Madonna released &quot;Erotica&quot; and her sex book to much<br />controversy. She lost numerous fans and had an explicit lyrics sticker<br />slapped on the front of her cd. She took a risk by making music with<br />content that didn't appeal to everyone, but I think it's one of her<br />best cds. Lyrically challenging, pushing the boundaries of her image<br />with the public. In 1989, she released &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, and<br />again sparked controversy with the video for that song. The cd, I<br />believe her most personal, showed new depth with songs like<br />... Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; will probably be less successful than<br />&quot;Ray Of Light&quot; but no less important. &quot;Impressive<br />Instant&quot; is a musical departure for Madonna as is &quot;Nobody's<br />Perfect&quot;. Her ballads never sounded so refined, probably<br />surpassing the quality of &quot;Crazy For You&quot;, &quot;Live To<br />Tell&quot; and &quot;I'll Remember&quot; with &quot;I Deserve<br />It&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Paradise (Not For<br />Me)&quot;. Two of her more interesting lyrical outings on this disc<br />are &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and &quot;What It Feels Like For A<br />Girl&quot;. Both songs seem to have personal statements much like<br />&quot;Drowned World/Substitute For Love&quot; on &quot;Ray Of<br />Light&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; on &quot;Bedtime<br />Stories&quot; and &quot;Promise To Try&quot; on &quot;Like A<br />Prayer&quot; have been. This time, with the release of<br />&quot;Music&quot;, Madonna challenges today's stale pop world to<br />excellent effect. I'd like to hear Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera,<br />Mandy Moore, Hanson, Backstreet Boys, N'SYNC, 98 Degrees and the rest<br />of that sorry lot do something as inventive with pop music as Madonna<br />has done here.
B00004T0US|4.0|It is important to realize how bored Elvis was with everything around him at this stage of his life. His career, although not floundering was certainly not going anywhere. Elvis needed challenges to achieve personal highs, and at this time he was not challeged. He could record songs like this in his sleep. (Which was'nt far from reality here.) Which brings me to my point. The fact that he could turn in towering performances like HURT and UNCHAINED MELODY, and rock out with WAY DOWN and FOR THE HEART at this time in his life, prove one thing. Elvis, even at his most distracted and lowest point, is still better than dozens of other artists at their best. The country flavored tunes here like MOODY BLUE(which was his last #1 record)and SHE THINKS I STILL CARE would make Garth, Alan, Vince, etc...jelouse with envy. It's always been amazing to me how when Elvis covers songs like Olivia Newton-John's IF YOU LOVE(Let Me Know), he makes it his, even when the arrangement is identical to the original. One of my favorite tracks on this album is Elvis' version of the classic DANNY BOY. Recorded with just piano and Elvis, there is not a finer version of this song anywhere. Much has been writen about this session of recordings, as they were done at Graceland (in the &quot;Jungle Room&quot;)and were the last of his lifetime (except for live recordings). Did he still have &quot;it&quot;? Yes he most certainly did! It's too bad Elvis was'nt there to enjoy it. Thankfully we still can today!

B00004TH7Z|4.0|After having heard &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; via the steady radio airplay it was receiving, and having read all the glowing reviews of this album upon its release, I am happy to report that _Brave New World_ lived up to all of the expectations that I had for it.  It doesn't lay any new ground, it wasn't intending to, and it doesn't really need to.  Bruce Dickinson is back on vocals (and in top form) as is Adrian Smith on guitars, and while I was hoping to hear a little more from the triple guitar attack, there is certainly nothing to be disappointed with in regards to the song-writing here.  The album contains 10 tracks, of which only three are less then six minutes in length (which coincide nicely with three songs at eight plus minutes).  The album is not perfect, but most of the songs are very good -- offering a bit of variety, quality lyrics, along with the great bass and guitar work one might expect from classic Maiden.  Sure, their sound may be a tad too predictable, but for some reason when the songs are this good it doesn't really seem to matter.
B000001GRZ|5.0|i have been listening to the fournier for a number of years, in prior jacket covers, and find that no other interpretation comes close to its elegance ... this has become the  one recording i seek to share with others.....
B00003CXE7|5.0|Greastest movie ever,Russell Crowes best proformance yet.
B00000J6AG|4.0|The minute I heard Porcelain as the background music for a TV commercial, I knew I needed to have the CD that it came on.  What a surprise to find out that I already knew several of the other songs on the album as well.  I once overheard someone say that Moby is &quot;an artist whose music you have listened to often, without even realizing who it is&quot; and since buying the album I believe this is true.<br />I already knew the songs &quot;Natural Blues&quot; and &quot;Bodyrock&quot; from radio play, but didn't know the artist (until hearing them on the CD).  Then after buying the CD I saw 3 more commercials with this music as background.  I think also that &quot;Why Does my Heart. . . &quot; was used in the HBO show &quot;Oz.&quot;<br />I do enjoy the album and appreciate the variety of the songs on it.  Some of the songs are a little tedious though, and at times I don't have the patience to listen to them all the way through (like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Find My Baby&quot;) just because there is not enough of a change in the rhythm.<br />But overall it's a good album and a welcome addition to my collection.  Hope it's like that for you if you decide to buy it.
B00004U2G1|5.0|When I first heard this disk, when my dad showed it to me, my jaw dropped open, and spent the next week and a half listening to nothing else but Boston!  This disk is the ultimate party music.  You have got to buy this thing!!
B00004X01U|4.0|Interesting- that is defeniately the word for M's latest. I love it tho. I look at it this way, you either love it or hate it. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is def. different. When I first heard it, I was like what is this? So i played it again and it was awesome. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, a sign that maybe M is gonna settle down? &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, heard this one on the radio- a preview before the cd came out- I loved it the first time I heard it!  Such an amazing song. Way to go Madonna! So I say if you like something different and &quot;interesting&quot; go purchase it now! Besides its Madonna so how can you be disappointed!
B00004U2G1|5.0|When I first heard this disk, when my dad showed it to me, my jaw dropped open, and spent the next week and a half listening to nothing else but Boston!  This disk is the ultimate party music.  You have got to buy this thing!!
B00004X01U|5.0|Interesting- that is defeniately the word for M's latest. I love it tho. I look at it this way, you either love it or hate it. &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is def. different. When I first heard it, I was like what is this? So i played it again and it was awesome. &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, a sign that maybe M is gonna settle down? &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, heard this one on the radio- a preview before the cd came out- I loved it the first time I heard it!

B00003W8NM|4.0|I really am disappointed.  I think the movie wsa too violent for 14 year old children.  I wanted to buy it for my cuban baby, Javier, but now I can't.  I think the MPA needs to get its act together.
B000002AZ8|4.0|Writing a review of one star shows how little this person knows about music.  I have listened to this album many times with large headphones on and just soaked in all the music.  And good music it is.  The two guitarists for Pearl Jam play very well together. I love their playing on &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;.  Also, the lyrics are very good.  Not only on &quot;Tremor Christ&quot;, but also on &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Immortality&quot; and pretty much all the songs.  Eddie Vedder sings very well.  He has a golden voice.  For fans of weird rock, I would highly recommend this album.
B000002WYT|5.0|I've had this tape for over  two years,and I just started to listen to it.I  bought  it  because  of  the  single,&quot;Crash.&quot;  What  a unbelievable,sexy,unique  cut.Dave Matthews  has a  voice  that sounds beutifull when he's singing  without any effort.Everyone has there own idea what  this song  is about.To me,it  almost sounds like  a rape,or maybe he's just a peeping Tom.I didn't think I would like another song as much as &quot;Crash,&quot; but I do.&quot;So Much to Say,&quot; and &quot;Too  Much,&quot;are some  of my  favorites, with  fantastic horn arangments,  violins,Sax,and  one  of  the  greatest  drumers,  Carter Beauford.  You never know when a songs going to end,and you don't want they  to,especially on the  last cut,&quot;The  Proudest Monkey.&quot; The jam  session at the end  is mind blowing.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator was an excellent movie and has all the aspects required to be a true blockbuster.  Crowe is awesome as the General Maximus and provides an intensity and depth of character that truly makes the viewer emphasize with his trials throughout the film.  Tragically, Oliver Reed, who plays the owner of the gladiator camp, died during filming.  Apparently they digitized his face for the remaining scenes and I thought they succeeded.  However, I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can look for the cover-ups.  Getting back to the film, it appears to be pretty historically accurate.  Commodus did in fact die at the hands of a wrestler/gladiator, although I doubt it occurred in the Coloseum!  The opening battle scene is as intense as any on film, and I guess I was a little disappointed that no other large battles occurred during the rest of it.  In short, great cast, great plot and great cinematography.
0375704027|5.0|True, the earlier translation by Birnbuam was very good. A kind of lie is being generated by the media and the publisher. In fact, Norwegian Wood, which is by far Murakami's best work ever, and a milestone in Japanese literature, was translated into English before and attracted many fans. Me, too. But the publisher decided that releasing WOOD in the early 1990s would not be good for Murakami's career in the US, (read: reviews and sales), because they wanted to develop his image first with his other books. Which they did. But it is not true to say the Haruki didn't authorize a translation before or that there was legal action problems. No, it was a pure marketing move by the editors in Japan and New York, and it was dishonest. Fans have been waiting for years for this book, and it is a real crime to have kept the book back under the pretense of publishing poppycock. That said, let Murakami someday tell the truth in an interview (he will, he will); meanwhile, read the book. It is by far the greatest piece of Japanese literature in the last 50 years and if you really want to understand the Japan that is today Japan, read this book...and weep. Murakami got it right. His publishers should confess to the public and stop this marketing PR spin. Give us a break, Haruki! So, yes, five stars, ten stars, this book will go down in history as Murakami's best!
0780020685|5.0|I saw this years ago and recently bought the DVD.  In short, I was blown away upon viewing it again.  Mifune's speech about farmers is one of the most emotionally charged scenes I have ever seen on film.  Although the movie is long, each scene seems necessary to the overall completeness of the picture, which can be viewed again and again.  I would rate this as Kurosawa's best film (granted I have only seen Ran and Yojimbo to compare it to).<br />The commentary by Jeck is actually pretty fascinating, although it gets a bit tiresome in the second half of the film as his comments shift away from the film and onto the actors themselves.<br />Clearly one of the greatest films every made (in any country for that matter).
B000000H6D|5.0|THIS is one of my all-time favorite CDs!!!  The first time I heard it, I thought, what the ---- is this???  Very dark sounding, but read the lyrics to this and other Type-O CDs and you see it's not too serious.  Graphic, YES.  But you don't get the feeling these guys are really on the verge of suicide like some other goth bands seem.  The music is real soul-stirring metal.  I actually considered using &quot;Christian Woman&quot; as my wedding song, once, in an alcohol-influenced moment--this music is that good.  If you get any Type O Negative, this is the one to get (I have the others and this one beats them all).
B00004X01U|5.0|... what is that you say?<br />That's just some of the outstanding lyrical quality of this cd!<br />The entire cd is completely addicting, and I know 5 years from now we will find out that we have all been subjected to subliminal messages proclaiming Madonna the anti-christ.  It's ok by me. At least we'll go happy.  Because, if you didn't like to boogie woogie before listening to this cd, you will after you've left paradise.<br />Yeah.<br />...and I don't look at the clock.
B00004W55E|5.0|Rachelle Ferrell has set her standard high with this Capital Release entitled : &quot;Individuality&quot;.  Support this unique and gifted artist! Treat yourself to this segment of her musical journey.  You will not be disappointed!
B00000IAU3|4.0|The album is a remarkable debut.  I kinda found this thing late(it has been out for over a year, around the same time the Moby Play cd came out).  I heard this song on a CMJ music sampler about 8 months ago. The song, &quot;Here With Me&quot; Totally floored me. One of the most beautiful and emotional songs I have ever heard. I am not a casual music listener. I have over 800 cds.     Bought the cd.  &quot;Here with Me&quot; is the standout. This album won't change your life. But Dido has real potential. If anyone cares to recall, McLachlans first record was a patchy affair as well.<br />She deserves to have some amount of success in this dreadful year of music.  She somtimes makes compelling emotional music that doesn't suffer to much from over production or being too trend conscious.  Can't say the same for most albums released last year.     The tile of this review refers to Dido playing live.  Wow one of the worst live acts I have ever seen.  It is not her fault completely.  Dido is a competent live singer and musician. But she really needs to fire her band or take away their testosterone boosters.  These guys were drum solo and guitar solo crazy. Totally obliterated the mood and struture of her songs. <br />Again, buy the cd.  Don't expect greatness and you'll have a very pleasant evening.  riyl-Kate Bush, Sara Mclachlan, Massive Attack and John Cale!
B0000004V2|5.0|Captivating is a word that comes to mind. This album has the power to move one to another plateau. The dreamy psychedelic irreverence of each magical track builds into a finale that is the unforgettable &quot;I am the Resurrection&quot;. The Stone Roses - the band that has influenced so many and shaped music to what it is today. Will they one day be resurrected and rule the earth again? We can only hope.
B00000GRL0|5.0|Its an inescapably flawed film.  The dialogue is silly, the American characters are borderline annoying....but its still Bruce Lee, and its still amazing.  You can watch fifteen minutes of pure plot-related tripe and then he steps on the screen and you immediately forget everything you hated about the last 15 minutes.  The final fight scene, in the hall of mirrors, which is so well-known its almost popular mythology, is ingenious and intense.  Just watching Bruce Lee do anything, even just sneaking around the compound, its like watching some sort of supernatural warrior-spirit.  Its undeniably rousing and imaginative.
630407185X|5.0|A Brige Too Far is an exceptional film about an event that was overshadowed, in this reviewers opinion, by the events of D-Day and the liberation of Paris.  The casting was excellent although I'm not sure about Dirk Bogard's portrayal of General Browning.  Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins lead a cavalcade of stars who gave riveting performances.  Yet a movie like this can't live on the big names alone.  The small supporting roles are what fill out the movie and make it believable.  The observations of the Dutch as the German Army falls back in disorder from France and Belgium and then regroups itself. The intelligence officer trying to convince Browning of the danger of tanks in the drop zone area sets the tone.  The communications officer wondering if radios that work well in desert conditions will also work in the boggy conditions of Holland.  The finding of the battle orders in a wrecked glider and their subsequent misuse by the German commander.  The RAF officer trying to explain, to a Polish general, that while it is clear in Holland, fog is preventing the Polish Brigade from flying from UK air strips.  The German panzer division commander trying to get his superior officer to understand that a real attack is being made and then the superior jumping ot the conclusion that &quot;he&quot; is the target of the attack.  Sean Connery being offered a mug of tea by his batman while he tries to reform his command is priceless.  The observation by Anthony Hopkins' charecter that they have camoflague that is fine for woodland areas but not too practical for the center of a city.  There are many other brief moments that taken together connect the film and give a much better understanding that once an action is started, it is anyone's guess as to how it will finally end up. What looks neat and tidy on an operation order is far from it when viewed by the soldiers at the battle line, a stone's throw from the enemy.  Over all, except for one possible charecter miscasting, the whole film is a tribute to the men of the Allied Airborne forces that took part in Operation Market Garden.  A must see film.
0783230664|3.0|Babe is a great movie, but the DVD is really lacking (3 stars for the movie, -2 for the DVD). As others have mentioned, where's the widescreen?  Where are the extra features? It seems very strange that a DVD for a movie as popular as this would be so sparse and uninspiring. <br />In addition to the above, the DTS soundtrack is very underutilized. While this may not be a huge issue since Babe isn't an &quot;effects&quot; movie, it is still disappointing. No doubt there will eventually be a &quot;Babe, Special Edition&quot; in the future that &quot;may&quot; remedy the problem, so avoid buying this DVD until that fairer day.
B000002N3J|5.0|This compilation album brings together some of her most timeless ballards that never once seem too soppy. Madonna had been in and out of the charts since 1984 and previous to this only one compilation had been  released,THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION (1990), so this was a much welcome offering. This compilation begins with a cover version of Marvin Gayes' I WANT YOU, which is haunting and atmospheric and is also a collaboration with Massive Attack. A strong track featuring a stunning performance! I'LL REMEMBER is another highlight of the album which again features a strong performance and stunning orchestra. However best of all is the previously unreleased track, YOUR'LL SEE. A strong track which is charged with high emotion and energy, this is now a rightful classic and sailed to NO.1 on the U.K charts. There is also another previously unreleased track, ONE MORE CHANCE which allows you to appreciate the full extent of Madonnas strong, vocal abilities.Amongst the other highlights (although this album is consistently very good to excellent throughout) include a cover version of LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE (by far the very best version i've heard of this much covered track), two hits from the eighties, CRAZY FOR YOU and  LIVE TO TELL (possibly her very, very best ballard of her 1980's recordings) as well as the grooving, R and B number, FORBIDDEN LOVE and the truly touching, OH FATHER. If you don't wish to collect her entire back catologue of albums then this and The Immacualate Collection are the ones to pick as are both thoroughly excellent and highly recommended.
0440224764|5.0|I abolutely loved the book! It has to be one of the best books that i have ever read. I have read several other books by John Grisham and they were all really good, but this one is even better.  I thought is was good because the story keeps you interested. Something new is always happening. It was a book that I just couldn't ever put down. I read the entire book in two days because it was so good.  I would highly reccomend this book to everyone. It isn't hard to understand and has a great plot. It was excellent.
B000002MUW|5.0|I can honestly say that Madonna is the only artist to whom i have enjoyed every single album. She never disappoints and every album she has released features a diverse range of quality tracks. This album is no exception with this steering into a more R and B sound that she carries off well. From beginning to end its compelling, catchy stuff. Perfect chill out music! The album kicks off with the pleasant and uplifting track SURVIVAL whilst one of her all time classics is delivered on the next track, SECRET. Every track is a winner but particular highlights include the catchy, DON'T STOP, HUMAN NATURE, FORBIDDEN LOVE, BEDTIME STORY, INSIDE OF ME and not that forgetting that other touching classic - TAKE A BOW. A thoroughly enjoyable album and highly recommended!
B00004U2A1|5.0|Evil Dead 2, while technically a sequel, holds very little in common with &quot;Evil Dead.&quot; Evil Dead was one of the scariest, creepiest, and grossest films I've ever seen. Evil Dead 2 is one of the funniest!<br />The gore in Evil Dead II is WAY over the top. (If you've seen Arthur's battle with the Black Knight in &quot;Monty Python's Holy Grail&quot;... THAT'S the sort of gore I'm talking about.) Campy lines are thrown around in here the like you've not heard since the Batman TV series.<br />The Premise: Ash (Ashley Williams for those who saw the first one) and his girlfriend drive up to a secluded cabin in the woods for a weekend of fun. They come across a tape recording of ancient incantations...that, when played, release an unseen evil that stalks them. When the cabin owner's daughter and team show up, the evil comes for them all!<br />If you don't try to take this movie seriously, you won't be dissapointed. One of the film's scenes was once rated in the top ten fight scenes of all time: Ash versus... his hand.<br />Now, for the DVD goodies!<br /> First, the DVD and &quot;booklet&quot; come in a tin! I was impressed by the tin and the arwork on it, but the booklet is a bit of a let-down. The pictures in it are simply screen grabs (and not very good ones) from the movie.<br /> THX and Widescreen add back what's been missing all these years. It's nice to see (clearer!) all of the bits we've been missing and the 5.1 audio tracks make those chase scenes sound like you're right there!<br /> The featurette 'The Gore the Merrier' is fantastic and left me wanting more! It would be great to see more of the behind the scenes antics of this crew, as it's plain to see (hear in the commentary) that they had fun making the film.<br /> And, the teaser for the video game &quot;Evil Dead: Hail to the King&quot; has me chomping at the bit! I can't wait to play a game as Ash! &quot;You want a little??&quot;<br />If you're an Evil Dead fan, this Limited Edition MUST be in your collection. If you just like slapstick/comedy/horror, you can't lose with this one.<br />When it comes down to it, if legions of undead started roaming the Earth, I'd want Ash nearby! Not just for protection, but also for comic relief!tion. If you just like slapstick/comedy/horror, you can't lose with this one.<br />When it comes down to it, if legions of undead started roaming the Earth, I'd want Ash nearby! Not just for protection, but also for comic relief!
B00004X01U|2.0|The first thing is yeah, what's up with the cowboy get up? Does she think she is American country/cowgirl? Wrong direction Madonna! Ray of Light was great, Music is a disappointment. Relying way too much on the mixers to do the work. She also really rushed this album out (wonder why?). It maybe a commercial success but as we all know Britney Spears is also a commercial success. I have to admit that i like some of the dance mixes of the single Music (at the club that you can dance to) but the vocal is just annoying and pointless and very cliche &quot;music bring together people...&quot; whatever!
B00004X01U|2.0|This CD leaves alot to be desired.  Even the choice of photography on the sleeve misses the boat.  Madonna looks beautiful but the choices are strange.  I bought the CD hoping to use it in my dance class.  The first cut, &quot;Music&quot; is fun and the second has a good beat. There is one beautiful ballad.  The rest of the ballads are repetitive and unmoving. Overall, it is nothing special.  No significant lyrics.  No catchy tunes.  No profound message.  No really great dance tunes.  A let down after &quot;Ray of Light&quot; which was really well done.  I expected alot more from Madonna.  It was like a quickie in the interim while she does her life.
6305627401|5.0|Stone and Parker have succeeded in providing America with a scathing look at our society, one quick to place the blame on everything for our youth's indescretions on everything but the parents- videogames, television, cinema, etc. As well as the satire endemic in the South Park TV show, it's damn funny! When I heard that a song from South Park was nominated for an Oscar, I rejoiced- if nothing for the fact that it would shake up the Oscar community! A movie definitely not for the squeamish or easily offended, it also parodies the classic gulag type movies- it's not hard to get the references. People not fans of the show might just want to rent it, but is essential for any SP fan. And if you don't like it, Blame Canada!
B00000K2SC|5.0|this is an awesome movie. the special effects are amazing and the plot is very deep.<br />the plot may be somewhat confusing at first but at the end of the movie, you'll be fully understanding it and thinking how all the events fit into place. the action scenes are incredibly exciting and the music fits perfectly with the movie. altogether it is an awesome movie... get it!
B000002BBY|5.0|This is in the Top 5 of best album's of the 90's in my opinion.  Some albums that eclipse it would be..oh wait.  This is the best album of the 90's.  Don't Look Back in Anger holds the spot as the only song to ever get stuck in my head for THAT long.  Wonderwall is still being played on the radio today..Champagne Supernova would go in my book as an &quot;epic&quot;.  The other albums are alright...but this album is it.  This album is called by many as the pinnacle of 90's popular music.  I cannot find a reason to disagree.
0679746048|1.0|Having seen the movie, I was very excited to get the book and see a more in depth view of the complex character of Susanna Kaysen. I was extremely disappointed with the book however. While the movie presents the viewer with a clear and fluid timeline and story, the book jumps back and forth through time with the only cohesive thread apparently being Kaysen's insanity.<br />If you enjoyed the movie, watch it again and avoid this book.
B000008B01|5.0|This record certainly represents a high water mark in the career of one of the world's great musicians. Gilberto's singing and guitar playing in the spare, zen-like setting communicate pure swing--the kind of bouyant feeling found in only the best work by greats such as Jimmy Blanton or Charlie Christian. The peak of achivement might be &quot;Eu Quero Um Samba&quot; or &quot;Eu Vim Da Bahia&quot; or the famous &quot;Aguas De Maro.&quot; You will discover your own favorites. My wish would be for a company to bring this thing out on 180 gm vinyl with careful re-mastering and pressing. I also wouldn't mind some discographical details. Yum. But in the meantime, this CD sounds very good since it is AAD. Buy it and enjoy!
B000002LK1|5.0|This is one of those albums that doesn't disappoint. Every, and i mean EVERY, track on this album is a hit. Not one dud. What i like best about Violator is the dance-ability of most the songs, i.e. &quot;world in my eyes&quot;, &quot;enjoy the silence&quot;; hence most songs are rather upbeat. &quot;Blue Dress&quot; is a hauntingly beautiful slow track reminiscent of &quot;Somebody&quot;, which i listened to over and over, it's just beautiful. DM has the reputation of being dark and gloomy but they actually aren't so different from OMD or New Order, esp. on this album. The Goth-Pop association is something i've never really understood, for DM represents euro-alt-synth-wave-techno-dance more than anything else. 5 stars is not enough for this album--it's a classic.
6305014140|5.0|This movie straight up dazzles.  When I saw the movie the first time, I was with experienced anime viewers, and we all loved it.  We burned our popcorn because we forgot to get it, we were so glued to the TV!<br />The story is epic, the plot is out of this world, and the characters are really developed well.  There is no real cheesy parts to this film like some anime has in it.  It's a masterpiece of entertainment, and I show this movie to all the people who do not know about how good animated films.  They almost always go away happy I showed them this film.
B00004X01U|1.0|After RAY OF LIGHT, which was an epiphany of musical creativity and spiritual insight, MUSIC comes as bleak twilight with Madonna racing downhill with velocity! I loathed this album and would gladly enter a long queue for a refund. Full of gimmickry, voice manipulations and background cacophony, MUSIC sets your head reeling without reeling you in! Just because Cher used the synthetic voice technique to perfection in &quot;Believe&quot; does not licence Madonna to come up with her own version in the illusion that it will work wonders. The album totally lacks inspiration and one hears very little of Madonna amongst the bizarre noises and discordant notes. Even the title track fades in impact after a few listenings. Nothing grows on you, and the overall impression is that of puerile silliness: as if a young girl was screeching through a harmonica and calling her 'sounds', MUSIC! NOT ONE song on this track comes close to the brilliance of &quot;Frozen&quot; or &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot; from her last album. MUSIC is drab and wretched. Guy Ritchie and Rocco may have imparted great joys to the woman, but they have done NOTHING to her as a singer. I declare this to be her worst album yet. Do I hear Cher giggling in the distance?!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Finally, after years of terrible music by MTV &quot;metal&quot; bands, Iron Maiden has made a serious comeback to show the newbies how metal should be done. This is a beautiful album. The track Blood Brothers represents to this listener what all metal fans are, brothers. My personal fave is The Mercenary, listen it to while watching anime, trust me, it fits. Thank you Maiden for saving metal from its decay. UP THE IRONS!
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|There's really nothing for me to say other than that this album culminates Bjork's illustrious career. Now being an award winning actress, I wonder where she will go from here? This album is a must have in your collection.
B00004YA66|2.0|This movie had such a sugar sweet quality about it, I got a tooth-ache.  I am surprised they didn't go back and save Political leaders and the like.  Enjoyable most of the time if you can get past the obvious lack of rational thought, and wasted  screen time.  I should have rented it on video.  Not a suitable movie to sit through at the theatre.  TOO LONG.  Rent it, make popcorn, take a break every 20-30 minutes, you're good to go.
B00000DQSV|5.0|Never judge a c.d. in the el cheapo bargain/cut-out bin of your favorite music store. Sadly, most obscure or even popular artists are known for having some project tossed in the bargain basement due to lack of sales or meeting the commercialized-top-of-the-pop charts criteria.The only great advantage to a consumer is if they really enjoy the album for a few bucks; Even if they don't at least an arm and a leg was not spent...<br />Duran Duran's Notorious is a prime example of a c.d. I have seen quite often in &quot;the bin&quot;. Fortunately, it is one of the most differently sounding albums put out by the group for the 80's in a positive way ! The Motown elements along with some of Duran Duran's trademark synth sound and production by Nile Rodgers (Chic fame)proved that this was not another pseudo-R&amp;B project by a predominantly white british band.Simon LeBon did not change his vocal style to sound like the great Barry White or Marvin Gaye in order to coincide with the flavor of the music; LeBon did not succumb to the &quot;white-boy-thinks-he's black&quot; syndrome!Yet, vocals,lyrics, and instrumentation work with great coherence and unity. And the horns, love those horns ! This is one of the more warmer sounding and naturally textured and colorful Duran Duran albums; the cold and sometimes robotic sounding characteristics of their earlier albums are gone...<br />Notorious is a keeper !
B00004Z4WR|4.0|This movie is so much fun to watch.  Very enjoyable and moves at a fast pace.  There is no lag time; the soundtrack keeps certain everyone is awake.  Beautiful cars, beautiful people, one helluva ride.  Very entertaining, I saw it three times at the theatre. ENJOY!
B00004X0ER|4.0|Top-notch punk 'n' roll from Scandinavia. Truly astounding how these five guys lauch one classic after the other . Easily the best garage-punk record of the last few years.
B000002KE2|5.0|When I bought this CD, the title was &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; since it included that song, done live, as a bonus track.  I almost thought this was another compilation, but Randy Rhoads' spirit led me to the right CD. Ozzy is the true leader of Sabbath.  Dio is not.
B00003CWTI|5.0|After Hard Eight and Boogie Nights, it wasn't immediately clear what direction P.T. Anderson would take. Many people wouldn't believe him capable to make a masterpiece, but it DID happen
B00004Z4WR|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE! GREAT CARS, THE SPEED GETS YOU HOOKED ON THE SCREEN. ITS A MUST FOR A DVD COLLECTION!
B000002NJS|5.0|All of Madonna's experiences have come full-circle and that theme very apparent throughout out Ray of Light. In each song it's very clear Madonna's voice and the purpose of her musical career has drastically changed since the day when she was &quot;Like A Virgin.&quot;  This album is a melting pot of music - from eastern culture to club influences. Ray of Light is by far Madonna's most complex album she has ever released.
B000002A3T|5.0|This is my favorite CD.   I bought this back in 1995, and it has continued to be my favorite.  I will never get tired of it. <br />Every single song on this album is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.  I know what I like,  and I LOVE this CD. <br />I like other albums by Pink Floyd, but this one is my favorite.  Who cares Roger Waters isn't on it?  I don't.  All I know is that is I love how it sounds, and I will never tire of it.   Peace.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I totally love Britney's new album.  It has the best songs ever.  &quot;Oops!.. I did It Again&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot; is the two best songs.  I really look forward till the video for &quot;Stronger&quot; comes out.  You should realy buy this album.  It's sooo much better than her first album.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is an awesome CD. I highly recommend it. My favorite songs are Frozen and The Power of Goodbye. Madonnas songs reflect powerful and meaningful messages. Madonna has always been an inspiration to me. Madonna is a great philosopher which shows in her music. I find Madonna's music to be spiritual and enlightening. I  think Madonna is a wonderful human being. ...  Madonna has greatly inspired me. Buy the Ray of Light CD, you'll enjoy it. I also like You'll See, Take a Bow, Live to Tell, Rain, and ALL of Madonna's music. Madonna is my favorite female artist-singer.
B000021Y77|5.0|OK kids, if you haven't heard of this film, you must have been either living under a rock or deployed to some forsaken land.  Run Lola Run aka Lola Rennt is in three parts, each following a similar trend, but with different culminations.  The lead role, Lola, spends the film trying to get money owed to the German mob to her boyfriend, but she runs (literally) into problems the whole way.  This is why the film is in three parts - each part is a &quot;do-over&quot; of the previous part.  If only real life was like this!  As a neat bonus, whenever she passes folks up on the street, small glimpses into their future are shown through Polaroid snapshots.  Run Lola Run is certainly one of the better films out of Germany lately.  The included music video is pretty cool as well.  Don't pass it up.
0881032565|5.0|I was assigned this book as a summer reading project for school.  I was not too wild about wasting my summer reading a book.  However, I finally sat down with the novel and read it.  Amazing!  The plot was so cunning and the end was unpredictible! I would not have corectly guest the killer at the end, though I did have a few suspicions about him/her in the middle of the novel.  Be sure to read the epilogue and letter at the end, otherwise you probably won't know who the killer really is!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|omg u have 2 get this movie it is so awesome it had so much action and its fast paced and the plot is awesome but the best part is that the characters r very well developed
B00003CWTI|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies I have come across.  It is exciting and full of emotion, providing more character depth.  As a reviewer said, that Magnolia is a 3 hour trip about 8 characters lifes, yes that is true, and the same goes with books, how it's trying to develop a character.  This movie not only develops one but also goes deep within their emotions and how some change, stay the same, or are enlightened.  I know there are other movies that do this too, but how can other movies show 8 characters lifes in 180 minutes without making the audience seem as they are being cheated emotionally.  Magnolia does it in such a precise way.
B00003CXGP|1.0|I just watched this movie over the weekend and I have to say I didn't like it.  Maybe I just didn't get it, but I found it to be rather pointless.  I can remember when Natural Born Killers (one of my personal faves) was getting into trouble about &quot;too much gratuitous violence&quot; and this movie has WAY more than NBK.  I found it pointless.  All I could see was a self-absorbed sex maniac with an extreme lust for killing.  That sums it up.  Maybe if there had been a point it would have been better.
B0000024JA|3.0|one of the illest styles around. <BR>slightly dissapointing release but ah well. <br />i miss the good old meth-him and 2pac got me into hip hop.

B000024F2G|5.0|I bought this album not long ago. I have to confess that I'm not a Bon Jovi fan from the first hour. The tophit I'ts my life brought me to this band and a girl made sure that I stick to it. I just love the balades and Always will forever have a very special meaning for me as it ties me to that important person. That's what romance is made of. That's what Bon Jovi's music is made of. And you can feel the power that is in these songs by listening to the records on this album. Take 'In these Arms' for example...It's full of desire and strenght...those who don't enjoy Bon Jovi are always laughing at me...but I don't care...that's another theme that somehow appears in the Bon Jovi lyrics: Just stick to what you are, stay how you are. There's no other way to describe this album...It's full of emotions.
B000002GB9|5.0|Come Sail Away, Fooling Yourself, Miss America, The Grand Illusion, all of these songs on this ONE album are what STYX is known for.  These songs made them famous.  This is another great mix of voices and music put together to make a great band.  Buy this CD, you WON'T regret it!
0792140346|5.0|Primal fear was one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen, or am likely to. Some people complained that the film went on too long, but the film had me gripped the whole way. When wathcing this film, you believe that you have it all worked out, and then new twists mean the ending is as unpredicatable as could possibally be. Wonerfully written, and Edward Norton puts on one of the best acting performances that you are likely to see.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This film will make you laugh and make you cry.  The cinematography is excellant; you become part of the story in a way and you feel the joy, excitement, and sorrow that the characters portray.
B00000DLVA|4.0|This album introduced me to the Cardigans. 'Lovefool' had me hooked, but I just didn't know the group very well, until I borrowed this album from a friend about a year and a half ago. I immediately had to have it! <br />I'm a pop junkie. I just can't stand rap or most alternative, unlike most people my age. This album fulfills my need for light music, and so much more. When I first got it, I was taken away by it. I have to hear it all the way through, without stopping, every time. That rarely happens with most albums I buy. The rundown:<br />&quot;Paralyzed&quot; opens the album perfectly, with the first minute slowly building up, and then exploding, engulfing you in, not music, but, an experience. &quot;Erase/Rewind&quot; is one of my favorite songs, perhaps ever, because the music and mood is bouncy and just flows along. <br />However, the mood soon changes. &quot;Explode,&quot; &quot;Starter,&quot; and &quot;Hanging Around&quot; become decidedly darker, but stay very fun. &quot;Higher&quot; is the high point of the album for me, because of the harmony. It is also the last fluffy song you'll hear on this album for a while.<br />&quot;Marvel Hill&quot; is really the only song I have a problem with. At first it's catchy, but as the song progresses, it becomes very heavy, serious, and, to me, unlistenable. With the exception of the first time I listen to the album, I don't think I've ever heard the last two minutes of the song.<br />&quot;My Favorite Game&quot; is fun, and also a good song to play a video game to. &quot;Do You Believe?&quot; might have become as 'beloved' as &quot;Marvel Hill,&quot; but it is blissfully short, and not as repetitive. &quot;Junk of the Hearts&quot; is the closest thing you'll get to a ballad. It's mainstream pop, so it doesn't enhance the listen experience, or hinder it.<br />The album ends with &quot;Nil,&quot; a instrumental. The best way to describe it, would be if you went into an old ghost house, and you could hear a ghost playinga piano. It's a very old sounding song, and it's also very distant sounding. It's one you have to hear. The last few seconds sounds like wind blowing, and if you listen at night, or in the dark, it will very likely give you the creeps. But, it's very haunting, and very beautiful.<br />I liked this album. It's a good blend of alternative, trip-hop, and pop, with a nice drum work. It's almost like techno-jazz, if you will. It's a nice album for your pop, rock, or electronica collection. (Just watch out for &quot;Marvel Hill.&quot;)
B00004X01U|5.0|This cd is full of great songs here are my three favorites and a little bit about them!!<br />Music- an upbeat catchy song that i'm sure everyone has heard. THis song is awsome and is the reason i bought the cd! <br />Runaway Lover- MY Favorite madonna song! it is awsome its a song that makes you wanna dance!! its awsome u'll love it!<br />What it feels like for a girl- a kind of depressing and moving song but a good one none the less! its got a slow beat but it is a good song!<br />There are other great songs but those are the three i enjoy the most! The main style of the cd is upbeat dance music and there are about 2 slower songs one of those being ,as i already mentioned, what it feels like for a girl.<br />Overall it is a good albumn and i'm sure u'll enjoy it!
B00003CXDG|1.0|Mission Impossible is supposed to be about how good team work can overcome impossible odds. Obviously Tom Cruise et al think that it is about himself, overblown action sequences, himself, zero plot and err... himself. Come to think of it, both M:I movies had the bad guy as a former IMF agent (hmm, we seem to be struggling for a storyline here) The sad fact is that for and action movie, M:I 2 is boring. (check the 'car dancing' scene out if you don't believe me) I hope proper M:I movies will be made in the future that captures the spirit of the superior Mission:Impossible T.V. series because this is dull, dull, dull.

B00004THAY|5.0|I have always been an Eric Clapton fan but I haven't been a fan of some of his recent albums. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; was a disapointment to me because of EC's lack of blues songs. &quot;From The Cradle&quot; had some great guitar playing but did not have the energy I expected from an EC blues album. EC redeemed himself by teaming up with B.B. King and made a great blues album. Every single track is a keeper and there is some great guitar playing on it. For those who loved &quot;Unplugged&quot;, you will like this one just as much.

B00003CXE7|5.0|This is the first rated &quot;R&quot; movie I've seen that did not have one foul word or any gratuitus sex scenes and built its foundation on postive values even when confronted with such horrible, cruel power. Russell Crowe truly represented all those great things we would like to be ourselves. Joaquin Phoenix's acting exploration into the character of Commodus was artful.  The graphics were, of course, great and gave an astounding &quot;view&quot; of Rome at its height of beauty at its depth of immorality. Zimmer's music brought out the scenes with thought provoking melodies, orchestration and rhythms (e.g. waltzing during a battle) that helped carry the broad strokes of the story, the acting and the directing. Few movies compel me to watch it again and again, but this one is it! To have all the background information via DVD will be an absolute plus to any movie afficianado's collection.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|The movie was a thrill ride from beginning to end. I had to see it twice in the theatres and I can't wait to own it. People consider me a huge movie critic, so, my opinion is worth-while. The acting was great, the dialogue kept me believing, and the cars... well, let's just say you'll be impressed. &quot;Eleanor&quot; is now my dream car. I guarantee you'll enjoy this movie. However, there is one part in the movie that ended its perfection. He jumps about 50 yards over a bunch of cars and lands on all fours. Aside from that, everything was put together well. It's something for everyone... a little comedy, suspense, notorious actors, and a nice, touching ending... sure to bring a tear to your eye. A happy tear that is. Hope this was helpful. Enjoy
0062502182|5.0|This is a motivational/spiritual book written in the form of a novel.   This book is small &amp; to the point.  Teaching you about the taking responisibility for the choices you make. Making you feel &amp; 'see' how the world is working for you not against you.<br />Tells the simple story of a young shepherd boy named Santiago who just simply responds to his personal internal unrest, sure that he has something to learn.  So he phyisically goes on a journey (and we follow him), he learns to pay attention to everything that crosses his path &amp; learns to read the signs that the 'soul of the world is giving him'.<br />Only read this book if your searching to &amp; are quite often reflective as a result.   It brings to mind 'The Wizard of Oz' where the outstanding messege was <br />&quot;You've always had it my dear!&quot;
068485015X|4.0|I am a volunteer youth minister who recently started taking counseling classes for a Master's degree.  This book has been an wonderful resource to me.  Peck's descriptive explanations are educational on certain behaviours, the reflective nature allows a better understanding of them.  Peck allows a person to become self-reflective, to realize and accept the fact that &quot;life is difficult.&quot;  He incorporates that all of us are composed of parts to make a whole, and the need to heal the whole person.
0060977264|4.0|Paulo Coelho continues his philosophy of following your dreams, BUT this time he confronts the controversial issues of religion, mysticism &amp; love.<br />This time he uses two young people (male &amp; female), childhood lovers.  One has traveled the world &amp; the other has chosen to stay in the small town they grew up in.  Not till years later did they cross paths once again and together they explore the issues of duty, social norms and real love.<br />Like all of Paulo Coelho's novels he transmits strong life messages into magical stories that fill you with light.<br />I found more meaning in the story due to my personal knowlege of the Catholic religion.  This was a definate advantage.<br />I felt that this didn't dig as deep as the Alchemist did BUT, at the same time, he confronted the issues mentioned above with great success. As well as this,  it's a very beautiful love story.
B00004X01U|5.0|Like Ray of Light, Music is another excellent recording by Madonna that may be too good and too forward-thinking for the average radio listener.  <br />Music is certainly a lighter, less serious Madonna than what we've heard in a long time. This music is mostly fun music you can acutally dance to with just a few serious moments thrown in for a change of pace.<br />If you were hoping for Ray of Light Part 2, this new CD is certainly not it.  This is a completely different departure.  Gone are the musings of life, the sad, deep quality of life's teachings....replaced by danceable beats, rear-end shaking music, and fun upbeat lyrics.<br />I love this CD, however, it did take me about 2 or 3 listenings to actually see the gem it is.  I think that's because it's so radically different from Ray of Light, and it's a VERY different Madonna style of writing.<br />My only complaint would be that most of the fast dance songs are way too short.  Just when you're really getting into it, the song is over and you have to replay it again.<br />EXCELLENT work Madonna!  You are the true innovator.
B00003CXE6|4.0|Gladiator was a movie on a grand scale.  Sometimes this culminated in awe-inspiring vistas and sweeping scenes.  Sometimes it left the lesser characters behind.  The story of a Roman general become fugitive become slave become gladiator, it paints a picture of life in the Roman empire as seen from several social levels and explores the gritty life of the gladiator.<br />Crowe's character, Maximus, is oringal and a good mix of tough and tender.  Unfortunately most of the other characters are not written with such insight and come across as two dimensional.  This movie truly is carried by Crowe.  The plot is quite predictable at points but the end surprised even me (I have seen so many movies that I can easily spot a cookie cutter plot and usually know how it will end half way through).  It was a refreshing change.  The computer graphics were amazing, especially the shots of the Colesseum, and there was a good balance between the grand sweeping shots and the small private moments that really let the audience get to know the characters.  It would have helped if the moviemakers would have let the audience get closer to Phoenix's and Nielsen's characters but they seemed intent on making the first purely evil and the second a helpless victim.<br />One thing that the movie did eccel at was recreating the glory and spectacle of the Roman Empire.  Roman culture was well represented and history well meet if stretched at points.  Another triumph of Gladiator was the soundtrack.  It provided a beautiful counterpoint to the big events and subtly underscored the smaller moments.  Plus it blended perfectly with the action in the battle scene and the death scene and really brought Elysium to life.<br />Gladiator may not be on par with the other cinematic Roman spectacles but it is one of the better ones to come out of that genre.
B000008GEF|4.0|I enjoy this album.  It can either be tedious or pleasant, depending on a pre-disposition to religious songs.  The Beatles were at once the best and worst thing to happen to George Harrison.  The best for the obvious capitalist reasons, and the worst because of the expectations it created for his post-beatle career.  THE LIGHT THAT HAS LIGHTED THE WORLD is a plea by Harrison to be released of these onerous, misguided hopes. Most of those expectations have fortunately disipated after more than three decades.  I don't really know what the pop music public expected from George Harrison in 1973, however, this does not seem to be it.  That  is regretable because this is a unique album.  The musicians are top-notch and put in an inspired performance.  Bassman Klaus Voormann, for instance, has some outstanding moments.  With the exception of the titilating SUE ME, SUE YOU BLUES, this is an introspective album in which Harrison articulates his religious beliefs.  Further, these are, for the most part, unpopular with his audience.  These are not vapid pop songs (RINGO), they do not deal with temporal relationships (MIND GAMES), it is personal without being self-indulgent (RED ROSE SPEEDWAY), and neither is it a calculated commercial offering (BAND ON THE RUN).  It is simply George Harrison descibing his religious beliefs.  The lyrics have a serious content the depth of which no other popular artist has attempted. GIVE ME LOVE is a personal prayer for spiritual peace.  In contrast to the message of GIVE PEACE A CHANCE, it is not praying for world unity, but rather spiritual unity with his LORD.  BE HERE NOW wrestles with the indescrible situation of eternity in a temporal existence.  It is as successful as might be hoped for from a man descibing &quot;colour&quot; to a blind audience.  &quot;Can't say what I'm doing here / but I hope to see much clearer&quot; is an honest confession of spiritual confusion from LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD.  As a whole, this album is a huge commercial, and personal risk.  George Harrison is in essence putting out into the world for everyone to see and criticise his most personal understanding of his spiritual relationship.  While I do not share his selected focus of spiritual expression, I do admire his courage in taking such a stance.  That this album is nearly out of print, at the time of this writing, testifies that it is even more grating to public sensibilities than PLASTIC ONO BAND which has now been remastered with extra tracks.  If you are interested in hearing an honest expression describing a spiritual relationship on very personal terms, this CD will interest you.
6300270432|5.0|I am continually surprised no one I talk to about this movie has heard of it.  This is really a fantastic gangster/crime movie in every way with a great story playing off the common giri vs. ninjo japanese motif.  Having spent time in Japan, this is one of few American movies that treats the Japanese culture as more than a one dimensional gimmick.  Mitchum and Takakura Ken are perfect.  I really feel this movie is one of the greatest of all time, certainly on par with recognized 70's greats like TAXI DRIVER (from coscripter Paul Schrader) and CHINATOWN (from coscripter Rober Towne).  Do not miss this one!

B00003BE03|2.0|While this is a moderately good monster movie, this is a horrible Godzilla movie. It's virtually identical to &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot;. And another thing that bugs me about this movie is the total lack of research. In the film, the AH-64 Apache helicopter is shown as a one-man chopper with guns on either side of the cockpit. The real AH-64 is a two-man chopper with one machine gun mounted UNDER the cockpit. Also, the creature's claws are all wrong. Lizard claws are flat on the bottom, whereas the creature's are rounded, like birds. And whoever came up with that &quot;within a year, these 200 babies could become 40,000&quot; line should watch the movie again. The first one wasn't able to lay eggs until it was at least thiry years old. Thirty years seems like planty of time to hunt down and destroy those hatchlings.
B000003S2K|3.0|This cd is indeed ambient. It is not to be listened to traditionally or with concentration. Play it, then come and go with the music. After a few spins, you'll know the album. It is very elusive and changes with every spin.  I have not in fact had  a chance to listen to it in an airport however.
B00004R99K|5.0|This was misreably under rated at the time of its origanal release in 1951 for its Americanisation of its familiar characters. However this has become the classic it rightly deserves! Drawing both from Lewis Carrolls volumes, ALICES ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS, this is beautifully animated and has some great, funny moments such as the hilariously over the top Queen Of Hearts. This remains the only notably succesful adaptation of the classic story therefore making this the definitive version. A true, loveable classic!
B00004X01U|4.0|Even though &quot;Ray of Light&quot; raised the bar on the musical risk-taking one could expect of Madonna, her new CD is suprisingly adventurous.  Nothing on &quot;Music&quot; sounds like pre-&quot;Ray of Light&quot; Madonna and the album is a big step beyond &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.  Very gutsy.  You really get the feeling like she's staring over with a brand new source of musical inspiration. <br />On the title track, the typical Madonna sound is mutated into a mish-mash of 70's funk, gangsta rap synth lines, and techno beats.  This revelation is followed by two more grand slams: the trippy &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; and the thump-heavy &quot;Amazing&quot;.  All of these will have the boy bands and teen tarts who are ruling the charts running for their mommies!  But just when you think you know where the album is going, Madonna pumps out a bunch of techno/folk ballads with muted beats and rousing pop choruses. ??!!??! Sorry to everyone who says Madonna just hijacks trends, but NO ONE is delving into this type of techno-pop hybrid with so much confidence.  Even better, Madonna's voice continues to evolve in interesting ways.  She purrs and soars when necessary and just seems more emotional and loose than on Ray of Light.  <br />I knocked a star off because some of the lyrics are downright bad.  Madonna can write great lyrics when she puts her mind to it (&quot;What It Feels Like for a Girl&quot;) so there's no excuse for some of the junk she tosses off on a few of these songs (&quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;, for example).<br />The best sign is that I had to listen to some songs a couple times before I liked them.  It's certainly hard to think of her as the &quot;Material Girl&quot; anymore.  With &quot;Music&quot;, the chameleon of pop music may have pulled off her most brilliant Houdini-like transformation yet.  She may make have finally escaped her own image.
B00004W4UB|5.0|This visually stunning film was unjustly trounced upon its release but should be rediscovered on DVD in a beautiful widescreen transfer.      Absorbing, elegant and intensely atmospheric.  Roberts is okay in the lead, yeah, her accent falters a good deal but she holds her own against Malkovich.  Still, it's Glenn Close who steals the show as a brothel madame.  The technical accomplishments are simply outstanding with fog seeping into every crevice of the forboding sets and a subtle sound design laced with sinister whispers.    Fans of \\"The Alienist\\" and Hammer Films should enjoy it.
0783235607|5.0|The film has been made and remade, but it's the Hitchcock version that is superb and legendary. The story is, by now, world famous: A woman steals $40,000 from her boss, runs away from the police and enters Bates Hotel, where she befriends Norman Bates. You all know what happens to her next: the infamous shower scene. The finale is chilling and beautifully acted.
6300184064|5.0|Brazil is scary, sad, funny, violent, intelligent. Don't listen to people who didn't like it, they just didn't understand anything... and this proves once again that all true masterpieces are controversials (like citizen kane). Every scene is perfect. This is perfection made movie.
B000003TAR|5.0|When Kurt Cobain wrote Nevermind he planned blow listeners away with a different sound than what was currently popular.  He succeeded in blowing them away, but to his dismay, he could not predict the popularity that the album would reach.  Now I would say that that album is not a weak or poppy album.  That album is loud and heartfelt.  But when Kurt found that listeners had been waiting for that sort of music, he decided to write an album that would be even louder, more depressing and meaningful so that this time he wouldn't get the widespread popularity.  He was right on the dot.<br />This album is a Kurt Cobain album.  No harm or offense meant to Dave Grohl or Chris Novolesic, but Nevermind was a Nirvana album.  When you listen to it you think &quot;man they're good.&quot;  When you listen to this one you think &quot;man he's good.&quot;<br />Serve the Servants is a happy, ponderous song with some fantastic chords (and a spectacular solo).  Scentless Apprentice is raw and loud.  A screaming song.  Heart Shaped Box is very good, one of the best.  Rape Me has a pretty verse and a real rocking chorus.  Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle is wild.  I LOVE the guitar riffs in this one.  Dumb is one of Nirvana's best acoustics, along with Pennyroyal Tea.  Very Ape is fast and quite good.  Milk It, in my opinion, is one of the most underappreciated songs ever.  Slow, agitated and frightened in the verse, loud, harsh and painful during the chorus...Kurt did a great job on this one.  Pennyroyal Tea is an awesome song, very sad but just an excellent one all around. This would be my favorite Nirvana slow-song.  Radio Friendly Unit Shifer is a really loud and good song, however the weird noise in the into gets annoying.  Tourettes...is simply crazy and awesome.  You learn to love it.  All Apologies is sad.  It is a very well written song, with good lyrics and a great chorus.  It's almost like its Kurts last words to the world.<br />This CD is different.  When looking through the inlay, you would not expect this to be from the biggest, richest, most popular band of the time.  It looks like some underground group making its first big label record.  I would just describe this as wonderful, the best by Nirvana.  I suggest that if you have Nevermind, buy this as well....

B0000028M7|5.0|_Dirt_ is one of the best rock albums of the '90s. Jerry Cantrell is a great guitar player, even if he doesn't get the proper recognition, and Layne Staley has an oddly melodic voice. This is one of my all-time favorite albums. In my opinion, it ranks right up there with _Led Zeppelin II_. Nirvana's _Nevermind_ may have been the most influential album of the '90s, but _Dirt_ was the best (even better than Metallica's self-titled album). From &quot;Them Bones&quot; to &quot;Would?,&quot; _Dirt_ rocks all the way through. This is an album that you can listen to from beginning to end.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|Well, no one can say this movie did not have enough action, or not enough chase scenes, and did I mention the cars?  Critics who tore this movie apart really need to stop complaining about films that are only made to entertain.  It seems that some idiot invented an unwritten rule that says &quot;movies have to have deep involving scripts to be good.&quot;  It IS true that well made films have good scripts, good characters that we can relate to, and most importantly, an involving story.  Well then I guess this isn't a well made film, but SO WHAT, it's entertaining, fun, and pleasing to the eyes (cars, fun action) and ears (very loud, get on DVD).  It's definately a car movie.  Check it out if you can take the action

B00004KD11|5.0|The history of Deep Purple is really about two different bands.  First, the the ingenious guys who thought up Hush &amp; Mandrake Root and did Vanilla Fudge-style covers of Help. Second, heavy metal riffing and screaming with Smoke on the Water (talk about dumb lyrics!). There's nothing wrong with being a metal band but nothing particularly special about it either. Except of course, for Ritchie Blackmore. Take him out of the equation and game over. But I digress; enjoy this unique and cool first album.
B00000K2SC|5.0|The Matrix surprised everyone in 1999 by being so utterly brilliant. A truly original film, it had a similar sort of impact to when Star Wars came out in 1977. (Incidentally, the Phantom Menace came out at the same time, but the Matrix more than held its own.) Written and directed by the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix is seemingly set in the present day, where Thomas Anderson, played by Keanu Reeves, lives an ordinary life by day, and is a computer hacker by the name of Neo at night. His night-time activities bring him into contact with a mysterious person named Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne). Anderson discovers that reality as he knows it at the end of the twentieth century is an elaborate sham, a hoax. His world is simply the Matrix; in the real world, he, and the rest of humanity, are in bondage, enslaved by a malevolent artificial intelligence. The film follows Anderson's dramatic discovery of the real world, and ultimately, a dramatic discovery concerning himself. The film is set up for at least one sequal, but works well as a single independent film. The screen effects are unprecendented in their brilliance, and are enough on their own to keep you on the edge of your seat. Besides that however, the story is fascinating, and the script very appropriate. Keanu Reeves is not the greatest of actors, but he plays to his strengths here, highlighting the vulnerability of Neo. Fishbourne is very cool as Morpheus, and newcomer Carrie Anne-Moss supports them excellently as Trinity. The film is complicated enough to be difficult to condense into a review, and exciting enough for me not to want to spoil it by going into great detail; it simply demands to be watched.
B00004RHZU|5.0|I love pink. I think she's the most talented and most real singer. She can make you feel her thru her music but besides that she sends off a vibe that makes you feel so good. You just play There You Go or Can't Take me Home and you want to move and groove. Her songs are all amazing hip hop beats with soul and rythm and blues mixed in. There are alot of singers like that but Pink's style is a first. If you listen to her whole CD you want to meet her and live her life for just one day. That's how I felt. Her best song is Most Girls. I like that song to death. Babyface made some songs on here, you can tell because they are the best ones. Her voice is so cool and her lyrics you won't forget. Is it Love sends chills up your spine. And you have to buy it for the song every body knows about, There You Go. Pink is where it's at for good music, great lyrics and alot of soul.
B0000025JT|4.0|...has to be one the best songs B. ever recorded. No doubt she has completely disowned this song given its love victim lyrics, but it not only captured the year in which it was made stylistically, it captured a sentiment and expressed it both musically and lyrically that is all the rage in academic circles right now: memory. This song can and should become the theme song of American Academics United and should be played at all university conferences. The invocation and yearing to have it made like a memory is universal and is perfectly expressed in the belting out of that line. From the vunerable whisper of &quot;Didn't I like to hold you in my hand&quot; to the plea &quot;make it like a dream unreal&quot; to the final belt of &quot;make it like a memory&quot; B. got it down, and why she doesn't include this on her greatest hits is beyond me.
B00004S361|5.0|&quot;Fulfillingness' First Finale&quot; is often neglected among Stevie Wonder's classic recordings, following 1973's groundbreaking &quot;Innervisions&quot; and preceeding 1976's seismic &quot;Songs In The Key Of Life.&quot; Perhaps realizing this CD re-release could fall between the cracks among Wonder's other 70s studio sets (let along his subsequent hits collections), engineer Kevin Reeves masterfully brought Wonder's songcraft and detail from this collection, reminding many of its musical depth 25 years after its release.<br />Motown was often known for putting first-rate re-releases on second-rate vinyl. Thus, the CD revolution (and 90s digital remastering) makes &quot;Fulfillingness'&quot; even more an overjoy. You now hear the slight giggle before the funereal &quot;Too Shy To Say,&quot; the off-beat hand clap in the funk indictment &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin',&quot; the grunts and growls (and Paul Anka's background vocals!) in the moving &quot;Heaven Is Ten Zillion Light Years Away,&quot; the almost mocking &quot;Bye, bye&quot; chorus in &quot;It Ain't No Use.&quot; These details, along with trademark stellar backup by guitarist Michael Sembello, bass master James Jamerson, and vocalists Niecy Williams and Minnie Ripperton, are now clearer, brighter, with melodies further and fresher toward the surface.<br />This album, with its lyric images of inner beauty &quot;Bird of Beauty,&quot; &quot;Smile Please,&quot;) and spirituality (the frightening &quot;They Won't Go When I Go,&quot; written with Syreeta) set to some of his most thorough melodies and arrangements, is as emotionally moving and cohesive as any of Stevie Wonder's more acclaimed releases. &quot;Fulfillingness First Finale,&quot; bad grammar and all, is among Stevie Wonder's finest music; which is to say, among the best ever created. Absolutely essential.
079213690X|5.0|Braveheart shows us two things I'd like to focus on; combining arms and leadership. Certainly in the top 10 movies of all time; Braveheart shows how a force that is inferior can defeat a superior force by using a technotactical weapon (some will condescend and call a &quot;gimmick&quot;) if an asymmetry can be found. The way Wallace uses pikes to repel a cavalry horsed attack is eye-opening and priceless for today's military professional who is kept in a state of ignorance about the nature of war. The conclusion to be drawn is that war as a creative act of human will is best conducted when we think up and employ such &quot;gimmicks&quot;. A lot of folks in our military need to realize this---so watching Braveheart is a good medicine. The movie in following scenes then shows the inter-play between infantry, cavalry, archers and how war is not a dumb macho duel as we are fed a steady diet from other Hollywood films.<br />The next aspect is the Leadership of Wallace that has to fight human nature in his own ranks. His speech before his men in blue war paint is one of the greatest in film history and strikes a chord akin to Chamberlain at Gettysburg. His question is the same that we face today, do you want to &quot;go with the flow&quot; and let the world dehumanize and take everything away from you or will you say &quot;enough is enough&quot; and stand and fight? The point is Wallace is there in blue war paint, not in a dress blue uniform, not in a computer center miles away; he will live or die himself by his &quot;gimmicks&quot;. He asks them if they are going to let the British take their humanity away. We know the answer for the film and its a good one. Then we see the price Wallace himself pays for leading-by-example and doing what needed to be done to save the people. Notice how the visionaries always need and sometimes get HELP---Wallace has a small circle of friends who are his &quot;inner circle&quot; and this rings true in life. However his public reward was back-stabing by those who would not take the risks nor stand and fight; those that led their people to tyranny one small indignation at a time. Knowing all these things, who are YOU? Are you a William Wallace or are you more concerned with your social status? The true test of a leader is that he by definition sees a problem of the people and overcomes it, which means risk and certainly not going along with the status quo. Will America which has done its best to browbeat and assasinate charismatic leadership have such men when she faces her darkest hours?back-stabing by those who would not take the risks nor stand and fight; those that led their people to tyranny one small indignation at a time.

B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie is one of the most hilarious movies I ever saw. I loved when they made fun of almost ever movie. I don't care what other people say, this is a funny movie. . . if your a teenager. Adults might not think it's funny and won't even rent it let alone buy it. So if you did or didn't see it, buy it on DVD. I hope the DVD includes commentary by all the cast and Director, lots and lots of deleted scenes, lots of funny outtakes, and possibly a &quot;Making Of&quot; if they made one. So all you teenagers go buy this funny movie when it comes out.

034537410X|5.0|THE BEST AVAILABLE GUIDE TO LUCID DREAMING!<br />Although this inspiring book presents a new model of dreaming and consciousness, its approach is primarily practical, covering methods for inducing lucid dreams, and a variety of applications. LaBerge also includes a brief history of his scientific research; all is presented in an engaging and comprehensible manner. Reading the book gave me an appreciation for his dedicated pioneering in the field of mind/body mapping and the ingeniousness of his lucid dream induction methods and devices.<br />This book offers the most extensive collection of step-by-step techniques for increasing consciousness during sleep. It also includes accounts of what a variety of lucid dreamers have done with their dream lives. For me, the most important point was how the same skills and mindfulness developed through learning to lucid dream can also deeply enhance one's waking life.<br />Why sleep through dreams (and sleepwalk through waking life) when lucidity is a learnable skill? This excellent, easy-to-follow guide is essential reading for dream explorers of all levels of experience.
6303942830|5.0|What I like about Last of the Mohicans (LOM) is that it shows the interplay between early muskets which were slow to reload and how in-close the knife/hatchet of hand-to-hand combat was still deadly. The British in bright uniforms for distant command and control and closed ranks to mass musketry/rifle effects on an open European battlefield are at a disadvantage and get ambushed continually by the Indians who play &quot;dirty&quot; and ambush them from thick vegetated hide positions in the American wilderness. Funny how Western armies want to fight in the open, when in the case of America we were born by mixing terrain agility and firearms/hand weapons effects--highly recommend LTC John Lock's &quot;To Fight with Intrepidity&quot; on early American Rangers as a companion reading to this film/video/DVD.<br />The film really does light infantry justice, showing fluid movements and long-range firearms accuracy when needed. It shows the need for very good infantry in closed terrain to prevent close in ambush of the main body, be it in vehicles or on foot. It reminds us that hand-to-hand combat skills are still needed, to include the rifle/bayonet which incidentally is the anti-cavalry pike (see the film Braveheart) in a modern form. LOM stands on its own as the best depiction of this type of warfare with a nice human interest story of a man who will not let his woman be unrescued.
B000001FSP|5.0|Even as she had hits in the '60s with \\"As Tears Go By\\" (written by her paramour Mick Jagger), Marianne Faithfull was primarily known as Jagger's girlfriend, and any sort of talent she may have possessed was not worth noting. But after she and Mick called it off, Faithfull began a slow recovery back into both her music and her life. Heroin addiction had sent Faithfull on a nightmarish journey that would be effectively captured on the Rolling Stones' classic \\"Sister Morphine\\". Marianne wouldn't get her chance to do good until 1979 with her highly-acclaimed comeback BROKEN ENGLISH. She had recorded a few albums before this, but they were tentative efforts before BROKEN ENGLISH effectively announced her return. Those who listened were in for a surprise, especially those who first heard her as the virginal voice of \\"As Tears Go By\\". Years of drug addiction had caused 33-year old Faithfull's voice to lower to a much more raspy, war-weary groan, but only that voice could have sung the material on BROKEN ENGLISH. \\"Guilt\\", Shel Silverstein's \\"The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan\\" and \\"Witches' Song\\" all find Marianne creating true-to-life personas that all hit home even more with her scarred, yet still resonant voice. I'm always on the verge of sadness every time I hear those songs. Others like the title track, \\"Brain Drain\\" and \\"What's The Hurry?\\" are somewhat lighter, but not too much. Maybe it's the state-of-the-art new-wave production that the album actually benefits from and not dates it all. If the bulk of BROKEN ENGLISH finds Faithfull as a vulnerable waif, the last two songs display her as a woman quite angry with her past. Her cover of John Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" has her dismissing her early musical career and her decadence as much as Lennon used it to break away from the Beatles. If that wasn't enough, \\"Why D'Ya Do It?\\" has Marianne not just angry, but livid. Maybe it's about Mick Jagger more than anything else, and it seems she still has an axe to grind years after their separation. The first listen to it is a tremendous shocker, and it still is many listens later. BROKEN ENGLISH was widely hailed by critics and audiences alike on its release, going platinum without the aid of a huge hit single. Even better, it sounds like a debut album from a totally different artist, which in many ways it is. \\"As Tears Go By\\", be damned. This is Marianne Faithfull at her most naked and emotional.eir separation. The first listen to it is a tremendous shocker, and it still is many listens later.

B000009QPE|4.0|Best thrash metal album of all time?? Probably not.this album is wicked,but you cant really compare it to such classics as &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; or &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;.Straight away it hits you with one of the best songs ever created &quot;Angel of Death&quot;  everything a metal song should have,heavy,powerful,brain damaging vocals,and an amazing riff.But after that there's nothing really mind blowing,except &quot;postmortem&quot; and &quot;raining blood&quot;.This is a really great album but not the best.
0393316041|5.0|This is a great book, for both geeks AND non-geeks.  It explores the exciting life of Richard Feynman, one of the greatest physicists of the century.  But this book is not about physics, rather it tells you how interesting of a life a physicist can have.  It has stories of how the author got girls, tricked and joked on friends with his wits, did stupid things at formal occasions, and blabbered about many parts of the government and other recognized systems. I definitely recommend this book to those thinking about a career in research science like I am.  It gave me the impression that being a scientist doesn't necessarily make you stay in a white lab coat all day talking geek-talk.  On the contrary, you can still have a life.  It confirmed my want to pursue and education and career in research chemistry. As for non-geeks, you'll get a good laugh about the interesting character of Feynman, without needing any knowledge of math or science to read the book (though there are about 1 or 2 jokes that somewhat relate to math).
B00004WKII|1.0|what a shame, w/ the promo &amp; great looking cover, i was expecting some more from the master.  Unfortunatley, the quality and the selections are nothing more than a hodgepodge of left over garbage from someone's bad trip.  If you are a Hendrix fan, don't buy this, it's a total waste.
B00004THAY|5.0|B.B.King has never been better, and Eric is still God. You hope for a few good ones on an album - and this one delivers 7 really great cuts you will play over and over, with the other 5 better than most! The groove really cooks from the get-go on Riding With The King, and these men know how to build solos. They are gifted in their ability to create the tension that brings me back to The Blues time and again. After all, it's what you don't play that matters. I've written, performed, recorded and produced several albums myself and Less really is More - playing those rests is key. Some cuts are downright funky - it's great to hear that Hammond organ -  and some are just plain legendary like Three O'Clock Blues. Of particular interest was the slower than usual Hold On I'm Coming. IF YOU LOVE THE BLUES, YOU GOTTA BUY THIS ONE - IT'S A KEEPER!! I PREDICT IT WILL BECOME A CLASSIC!
6305696071|5.0|The DVD version only enhances this wonderfully simple but lovable movie. The extra footage adds just that little extra to an already extremely enjoyable movie. Make sure that you also listen to Garry Marshall in the director's comments. They are very worthwile and very funny. Richard Gere &amp; Julia Roberts are perfectly matched in the enchanting comedy, but the show is stolen by the brilliant support role played by Hector Elizondo(the part kick started his career), he rounds the cast off perfectly. The bad guy is well played by Jason Alexander (pre George/Seinfeld days), he plays the Wall Street, male dominating pig with great aplomb. All in all an extremely plesant movie that is easy to watch over &amp; over again. The DVD version just freshens the experience.

I've made almost all of the layer cakes (the coconut layer, humingbird and apple walnut are personal favorites) as well as at least two recipies from every other section and I've not run across one dissapointment.  The recipies themselves are easy to follow and do not require any exotic or hard-to-find ingredients.  I would definitely reccomend this book to anyone who likes to bake tasty and often gorgeous desserts.
0553573403|5.0|Get read everyone! A Game of Thrones will take you on a roller coaster ride. For those of you who are strict fantasy readers, and believe this book to be another one, you will be pleasantly surprised. I love fantasy. And maybe that is why I picked this book up. It looked like another epic fantasy. However, this book has redefined what a fantasy book is. No longer is there undefined characters carrying out predictable quests. This book is very effective in developing characters. You will meet the scoundrel, the hero, the underdog, the damsel, the dedicated, and the ambiguous. Martin takes you through each of the players thoughts, plots, etc... They clash in extremely entertaining scenes. It leaves you wondering what will happen, who will win. A Game of Thrones is not just a fantasy, but historical fiction, a mystery, a romance, and an uplifting story. I urge those who don't read fantasy to dive into this book. I guarantee you will want more. A fantastic piece of work!
B000003S0D|5.0|I view Lizard very differently from almost every other fan of King Crimson, it seems. I view the title track as an actual story, that makes sense, and it made sense to me from the first time I heard the album. It's a story about rebellion that ultimately fails, there's a leader, a battle lost, and the leader then laments in &quot;Prince Rupert's Lament&quot;. Most fans seem to think these are all individual ideas with no meaning at all, just put together arbitrarily. But I don't see why it isn't clear, the lyrics and music tell a pretty straitforward story. Actually it seems like Crimson fans just want to talk about instrumentation and not themes or meaning in music. Oh well...I am very moved by the story I hear in this music and I think it's a masterpiece, not any one kind of music but simply a broad, far-reaching palette. I don't think the small individual pieces are as good as &quot;Lizard&quot;, but this usually happens when so much energy is dedicated to one symphonic piece.

He goes on foot to the great castle in the Arctic regains his powers and after a colossal fight in downtown Metropolis, leads the three super villains aided by earthly villain Lex Luthor to his ice castle where he tricks them into losing their powers by using a red strobe ray (disco was not completely gone then).  Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman and Margot (she's a great) Kidder do their customary adequate jobs.  This is the best of the series and Superman gets his revenge on the diner bully in a big way.  Lots of fun.

B00003CWTI|5.0|WOW ! This film has left me speechless. I've watched it and I'm still not sure what to make of it. It's been a long, long time since I've seen a film this good. I knew nothing about the film before seeing it except that it was based on some songs by Aimee Mann. Being an Aimee Mann fan I decided to check it out and I can only say, if you see one film in your lifetime, see Magnolia. I bought the two disc version and the extra features are well worth the extra money. If I ever find another disc/film as good as this I would be very surprised.

B00004Z4WR|5.0|I've read quite a few reviews from critics and other sources of information only to find that the majority seem to think that this movie was poorly made. I completely disagree. Movies aren't always about a perfect story line, or perfect acting, or even being perfectly accurate. Some movies are made just so the viewer can have fun and sometimes an adrenaline rush.<br />I'll be the first to admit that Gone In 60 Seconds wasn't a blockbuster. It didn't do anything new for the genre. But, the sheer awesomeness of the cars and the speeds at which they are driven makes the movie enjoyable. This movie is obviously meant to appeal to car enthusiasts and it does because it's all about cars. No filler content, no real attempt at an amazingly intriguing movie, just cars... and that's what makes it fun to watch. I HIGHLY reccommend it to anyone who even remotely enjoys cars. If you don't like cars, don't even bother.

B00003CXE7|2.0|I've been a big fan of Crowe since Romper Stomper and thought he was great in LA Confidential, but in Gladiator there's really not much for him to do but grunt.  The opening battle scene was a mess and early on set the pattern for all that followed in the arena.  Scott seems to have gone for the typical high gloss form of Hollywood filmmaking, employing quick cuts with something flying into the camera every second (the latter seems to be the action norm ever since the Twister trailer).  The ending is the very definition of anti-climatic.  Bottom line, Gladiator never figured out if it wanted to be Braveheart or 13th Warrior, and as a result ended up stuck somewhere between an epic film and a fun movie.  Too bad it couldn't make up its mind.  Still, I'm looking forward to the DVD's commentary tracks; if nothing else, at least it looked pretty.

Anything about Japan just seems to draw me, but anyway... at that age I was listening to the Three Tenors. I remember distinct parts to the movie... the peach orchard, the female spirit helping the near-dead mountaineers, the walk through Van Gogh's paintings, the bomb.... and the encounter afterwards between a human being and a man mutated by the radiation of the blast. A lot of this moved me, and it inspired me into writing one of my earliest poems which I used for an assignment in school. This is both a visually and spiritually compelling movie,....................
6305807086|2.0|...to put it mildly, just very ok.  The story was very weird, which I did like, but the characters were all very unlikeable. Very much so. In fact it was so bad that I did not care one way or another about what was going to happen to these people.  I felt the different subplots just made the movie longer and several of the jokes did get real old, real fast.  I know that this movie is not for everyone.  Some people will like it, others will hate it.  I am sort of split.  I liked parts, but on the whole it was a very dull movie.  I would highly recommend renting this movie before you decide to buy it.  It may save you lots of head aches in the future.
B000002VCT|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project's &quot;Pyramid&quot; is one of those magical albums that just keeps finding its way back into my CD player! I have had this CD since 1987, and still get the &quot;craving&quot; to hear it on a regular basis. This is just one of those albums with a perfect &quot;flow&quot;, where every track just blends together to create a complete musical picture of the artist. But the songs on &quot;Pyramid&quot; will also stand up well on their own. Tracks like &quot;What Goes Up&quot;, &quot;Shadow of a Lonely Man&quot;, &quot;Can't Take it With You&quot;, and &quot;One More River&quot; will stick with you long after the album has finished playing. &quot;The Eagle Will Rise Again&quot; - with its lush production and light airy vocals from The Zombies' Colin Blunstone - is certainly one of Parsons finest moments ever. I would rate &quot;Pyramid&quot; right alongside Parsons finest works, such as &quot;Gaudi&quot;, &quot;Eye In the Sky&quot;, &quot;Try Anything Once&quot; and &quot;On Air&quot;. There are not as many straight-out &quot;rock-n-roll&quot; songs here as you would find on most other Parsons albums, the music on &quot;Pyramid&quot; is definitely a bit more on the &quot;orchestral rock&quot; side, with its occassional string inturledes, and subtle-symphonic accompanyment. I think that this album would have a great appeal to fans of British &quot;art rock&quot; bands like The Moody Blues and Barclay James Harvest, it certainly has many of the same musical strong points. As you would expect from one of rocks most important record producers, this album is sonically (as well as musically) excellent, and the CD format only enhances its clarity. It sounds like Parsons had a grip a that clean &quot;90's&quot; production sound all the way back in 1979! Also, in the same way that Parsons incorperated some influences of Spanish-music into 1987's &quot;Gaudi&quot;, here he plays on the influence of Eastern music on a handful of tracks. This is an album not to be missed! Take the &quot;voyage&quot;, discover the genius of Alan Parsons!t to be missed! Take the &quot;voyage&quot;, discover the genius of Alan Parsons!
B000002L1L|5.0|I was actually going to write a review for Slaves and Masters;  but, I could not find the recording here.  Perhaps Amazon placed it in the Rainbow section?<br />Mini review of Slaves and Masters:  Best Rainbow recording since Rainbow Rising!  Best Turner/Blackmore Rainbow album ever.  Probably 8th favorite Deep Purple recording of mine.  <br />Favorite Deep Purple recordings:<br />1.  In Rock because it rocks, and because was the first DP I ever heard.<br />2.  In Concert because it was long!<br />3.  Perfect Strangers because it was a return.<br />Now, here is where it gets confusing, and just has to depend on my particular DP mood.<br />Yes, there are times when I'm in a mood to listen to this recording.  <br />Solitaire is a bittersweet song and it just wants to make you reproduce if you have not done so already.  &quot;A man without a . . .&quot; saddest bluesish song from DP since Mistreated off of Burn.  A truly great but difficult song to listen to if you identify with it.  If I die before I find the right woman and get married I want this song played at my funeral!  <br />Anya is probably the best DP song since Child in Time for those of us who feal Machine Head is/was overrated.  Machine Head only has 7 tracks.  This album has 10 tracks.  Machine Head only has 1 lame track.  But, if we just keep the top 6 tracks here then I think this recording should be regarded much higher than it is in the DP community.  Seriously, if you skip tracks 2, 8, and 10 this recording sounds much better.  How is that for a twist in the tale?  <br />I think if one listens track by track then stating that The Battle Rages On may be a better recording than Machine Head is not such a stretch.  Then again Machine Head does not make my list of top ten Deep Purple albums.<br />Stormbringer, Come and Taste the Band, Fireball, Slaves and Masters, and In Rock, are all underrated DP albums that make my top 10 DP list on a regular basis.  <br />PS.<br />Purpendicular and Abandon are some of the best recordings ever.  The new and improved DP rocks!  Weather, or not, this recording is better than those is simply a function of my mood.  Here is to the many shades of Deep Purple!

B00000I07P|1.0|When I saw Bon Jovi open up for Ratt I became a big fan.  He and his band blew Ratt of the stage.  This was a surprise and I expected him to record some great rock.  What I got here was pop blop.  Yes, this gives rock 'n' roll a bad name!  There is just enough good stuff here to truly torment a real rock fan.  <br />If you don't like rock music this may be for you.....
6305922756|5.0|This movie has always been one of my absolute favorites, and the new DVD version (which I just bought 2 days ago) is so loaded with extras as to be a necessary purchase by any SPINAL TAP fan. The mockumentary style was first perfected with Rob Reiner's amazing satire of a declining hard rock band, and this movie manages to serve both as a comedy, and an eerily authentic seeming documentary. The performances are all spectacular, although I'll always see Christopher Guest's performance as Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist, as the most inspired. That most of the dialogue was inprovised is amazing. That this movie is available with such a wealth of extras is amazing as well. For all fans of comedy, rock, or just plain fantastic cinema, buy this movie!!!
B00003CXE7|2.0|This movie could have been great. Russell Crowe is, despite the not so well written screenplay and mediocre plot, very convincing in his role, in fact he is the only one who makes a pretty good job in this movie - Phoenix was not bad. But that just because Russell Crowe in an excellent actor.    The movie fails because it was bad told, and not well directed. You couldnt identify nor share the characters feelings because of the large distance there seemed to be between them and the audience, and thats where the director fails, in the telling of the story.

0064471837|5.0|I have read the Harry Potter books, and eagerly await #5, and I love them.  But, and some may consider this blasphemy, I like this one more.  'Sabriel' is my favorite book, and that's saying a lot.  I have read it several times, and each time, I love it more.  I cannot wait for 'Lireal,' the sequel, to come out in early spring of next year.  It was originally expected in Cotober...I believe...but has been bumped back (thinking of Pullman, anyone?).  It was also supposed to be a sequel, but has ended up as two books, the third to be called Abhorsen.  I found all of this information at his website, along with four or five sample chapters of 'Lireal,' (the chapters are only on his older site) which takes place after many years after 'Sabriel,' but Sabriel and Touchstone are in it.  Back to Sabriel, I really loved this book because it was so engaging.  It starts strong and doen't let down.  I loved Mogget, and the bells struck me as such a fabulous idea.  The book deals with family, love, relationships, death, sacrifice, and, most definitely, magic and peoples understanding of it.
B000003S2M|5.0|This lp is the perfect match for Budd and Eno.<br />Budd's piano work is very noticable and to the fore on many of thr tracks- his style is very slow, allowing for much space to occur between (and during) notes (track 6, &quot;Not Yet Remembered,&quot; is a prime example).<br />Eno's signature is also all over this lp- the moodiness, the ambient textures that give Budd's meanderings (if thats the right word) a base on which to do so.<br />The combination of the 2 men is perfect, and from it came this ambient classic. At times chilling and almost cold, at other points morose, always moody and distant, this lp is not for the faint at heart or one who depresses easily. It is a dark, yet very satisfying, effort.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|I had reasonable hopes for U-571, and while I usually never pre-judge a movie, I had a suspicion that no naval film could ever be as good as Das Boot. Sadly, this proved to be true. Sure, it was well made, but aren't most movies these days? I found it boring, implausible and just plain bad. (Don't read further if you haven't seen it and want to decide for yourself) Certain elements of the plot (if this movie could be said to have one) are exaggerated, wrong, or unlikely. Firstly, we all know about the fact the the British were the first ever Allied troops to use a German sub to capture Enigma. The captions at the end of U-571 that reveal this fact, and many others, seems like an admission to failure if ever I saw one. Second, the badly damaged German sub commandeered by the Americans manages to sink a German destroyer: with one torpedo shot. Visual effects show the ship practically vaporizing in one second! Now, correct me If I'm wrong: but surely one torpedo would merely hole the ship, letting it sink slowly. Even if it hit a weapons magazine, I doubt the whole ship would blow up in so violent a manner. Also, the fact that the Germans even had a destroyer in the film is dubious: Germans never made wide use of Destroyers in WWII. And the fact that they just happen to have depth charges ready to deploy is unlikely: why would they need to attack Submarines, since they just about held the monopoly on Submarine Warfare in 1942. And the ship had a distncly un-warship like appearance: sort of dumpy like a converted trawler. <br />Overall, U-571 was the worst war movie I've ever seen. It lookd to be a hastily thrown-together film that hs no respect for detail, history, military hardware and story-telling.
B000003S28|4.0|This album generally ranks among the least liked by Eno fans, and I tend to agree with that. It's not so much the music, which at times comes across as uninspired and sounds like they were composed during rehearsals, but, as another reviewer nailed on the head, the placement of the songs does not allow for any sort of flow to occur on it. Perhaps that was done on purpose, perhaps not. Regardless, many tracks on here for me lacks absolute inspiration, though as a whole body of work I've come to like it more over time.<br />Not essential Eno, but certainly worth a listen, as all of Eno's lps offer interesting bits and pieces to take with you.

B000003S0K|5.0|Eno has always marched to the sound of his own drum, and this debut lp, while so incredibly amateurish and sophomoric that one is led to wonder whether Eno should have even made such an lp versus the concise sophisication of his later works, proves that to no end.<br />I am in no way knocking this lp- far from it. It's the amateurish feel that makes this lp work. After all, it was Eno who stated that the few people who heard the Velvet Underground all went out and formed bands. Eno was clearly one of those fans, and the lp is an all out eccentric barrage of songs that show that he had no inhibitions in making his brand of music.<br />And that is why this lp is so amazing. He clearly had FUN making it, and didn't care that he was still a rank amateur. He made music his way, and did so successfully.<br />This cd is a must own and a throwback to our days of idealism- when anything was possible if we weren't so self conscious about what other people thought about us. It's good to re-capture those feelings, isn't it?!
B00004W5UA|5.0|This video is weird, provocative and totally consuming. It kept me intrigued for its full 140 minutes and when it was over I thought about it for a long time.<br />Edward Norton stars as the unnamed narrator who cannot find peace in his life in spite of his perfectly furnished condo.  Brad Pitt plays the charismatic bad boy Tyler Durden, who changes the narrator's perspective forever.  Together they form a fight club, an underground support group for disaffected males who pummel each other into ecstatic enlightenment.  It's a twisted black comedy that intensifies in its violence and its meaning.<br />Ed Norton is one of the finest actors around today and it's amazing that he didn't receive an academy award nomination for this role.  He acts with his whole body, knowing just when to wince or open his eyes in rounded wonder. We see his character shift back and forth, experience pain, pleasure and fear as well as all the nuances of emotion that a human being is capable of.<br />Brad Pitt's performance is more one dimensional but he also gives a fine performance.  And Helena Bonlam Carter as the chain-smoking woman in their lives has a small but significant role.<br />I tried to read the novel by Chuck Palahuniuk several years ago but never got past the first chapter.  I found it dark and depressing and hard to follow.  However, as a screenplay and assisted by the writing skills of Jim Uhls, this wordy and strange novel takes on a whole new life.  David Fincher, the director,  brilliantly shot the fight sequences shadowed in darkness, but still full of blood and gore.<br />There's a surprise at the end of Fight Club which was very much in context with the plot although it takes the viewer into a different sense of reality.  It certainly  made me want to view the film again to catch all the little hints that must have been dropped along the way and that I missed.  I couldn't help thinking about it later and I expect I will continue to do so for a long time.<br />This is a quirky, twisted and dark film recommended only for those who are willing to experience some uncomfortable moments. So be prepared for the discomfort as you enjoy some good filmmaking.a quirky, twisted and dark film recommended only for those who are willing to experience some uncomfortable moments.

B00004VWAF|5.0|From 1972, &quot;On the Corner&quot; shows Miles Davis in the midst of yet another transition in his playing, writing, and image.<br />Many Miles fans dislike the lp because they see it as, dark, thick, repititious drudge; And those instruments used?! How can Khalil Balikrishna's electric sitar possibly fit in the realm of jazz?!<br />These points, esprcially from jazz purists, are certainly valid ones- but Miles was hardly a traditionalist by 1972. His visions of James Brown/Sly Stone funk meeting Hendrix (listen to Miles' use of the wah wah petals on his trumpet) in the middle of the African jungle came to fruition on this lp. The electric sitar and tablas add interesting spice to the overall project (and such instruments are common in some forms of Eastern African musics).<br />While Columbia records did not give &quot;On the Corner&quot; the proper backing they should have, (mainly because they didn't understand it) other jazz artists heard what Miles did and ran with it. Not surprisingly, Miles veteran Herbie Hancock, who also graces this lp in places, came out with his amazing &quot;Headhunters,&quot; &quot;Sextant,&quot; and &quot; Thrust&quot; lps in the wake of &quot;On the Corner,&quot; and sales were superb on all 3 lps- funk/fusion classics.<br />In heinsight, it's easier to grasp what Miles was trying to do on &quot;On the Corner,&quot; making it all the sadder that most of us didn't get it then. The music was ahead of its time- uncompromising, proud, and unqustionably BLACK- just like Miles himself. A gem of an lp and a lot of fun to listen to. Just listen to those deep bass grooves. Funky as all get up. Miles got it right- then again, did he ever not get it right?!
B00004X01U|5.0|Whoa, what an album. It's great to see Madonna turing out one hit after another. The high energy and unique blending of sounds surpass even the great work of &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; Outstanding tracks are &quot;Music&quot; of course, the very light and energetic &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, and the viviacious &quot;Amazing&quot; which really builds on the tunes of its predecessor &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; which in itself was a great song. Madonna IS the queen. LONG LIVE THE QUEEN! You're the greatest Madonna!
B000003S2O|5.0|I'll have to admit the fact that when I first heard this lp, I didn't like it. It was too dark, brooding, and all together too weird for even my tastes. I was in love with &quot;Music for Airports,&quot; and &quot;Apollo,&quot; and was looking for the same kinds of atmospherics and simplicity that these 2 lps created.<br />It's been 13 years after the fact, and 1000's of plays later, on lps, tapes, and now cd, and I cam never get enough of this lp. The atmospherics are beyond ecstacy, and while the mood is dense and dark, it is Eno's crowning achievement, and moreover helped me create my current home sound system, when,b after reading an article by Eno about how he would play the lp, I played this lp with 2 pair of speakers as opposed to one and with a cheap 4 channel mixer I owned for club djing I was doing. The results were earth shattering to me. The whole world opened up. I played the lp at dusk, and the crickets outside by patio door chimed in harmony to it. My neighbors would walk by and marvel at how nature sounded better at my place, and I grinned, never telling them why that was.<br />This lp has absolute sacred value to me, and I play it every evening before I retire for the night, and I sleep well. It is best listened to with excellent pairs of speakers that allow you to get surround sound, then to set levels to allow the bass to work on its own against Eno's use of prepared soundscapes and his electronics. This is your excuse to get more speakers! <br />The lp is so good that I implore everyone to get it. Your life will be more enriched by it.
B00004STW3|5.0|First of all, this movie was so much better than INDEPENDENCE DAY. It was comical and gory at the same time! The colrs are great; done the Tim Burton way. Great movie to sit down and enjoy with a great big bag of buttered popcorn and and a case of soda.
B000002ADT|5.0|There are very few albums made that I have problems finding the proper words to describe it with. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is one such album, and while the reviews written on this all-time classic that I have read are heartfelt and beautiful, words do this album so little justice, no matter how good our intentions may be.<br />The tracks are quintessential, what straight ahead jazz should always strive to be; the moods cool, passionate, sometimes playful, others times with a touch of melancholy, and always sublime. <br />The quintet was as great as any in the history of jazz- rivaled only by Miles' 2nd great quintet of the mid 60's- but that quintet didn't have Julian Adderly on the lp as a bonus... <br />Miles' playing is cool, confident, reserved, controlled, precise. His solos are just what the tracks need- no more, no less, no frills. The yang to Miles' yin, John Coltrane's musings are exploratory, urgent, always thretening to run away yet never veers far away fom the path. The joy of the lp, in my opinion, is Cannonball Adderly's playing. His rich alto is bright, professional, bluesy, and works wonders on the uptempo numbers like &quot;Freddie Freeloader.&quot; Both Wynton Kelly and Bill Evans on piano offer perfect rhythm section bases. Their playing is solid, never wavering, their solos crisp and clean, perfect to tap your toes to, subdued as needed (like on &quot;Blue in Green&quot; or &quot;Flamenco Sketches.&quot;) Finally, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb are arguably the most perfect bass and drum combo jazz ever offered (again, Ron Carter and Tony Williams in the 60's are equally great, but for very different reasons), and the most precise combo this side of reggae's Sly and Robbie.<br />Any album is only as good as its players, and &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; had the very best players jazz had to offer at that moment- each man blessed with talent and a willingness to stretch boundaries, break barriers, and follow the muse whereever it took them to; and the muse of &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; leads to God Himself.
B00003CWL6|4.0|Taken seriously, this film is very bothering.It's main aim is to criticize ,in an arresting ,extraordinary way ,the life story of the middle class in nowadays american society.<br />  After seeing it with a friend ,we analyzed it for quite a while. The movie is interesting and unusual, but I couldn't help the feeling that it was too much ,too soon for people like us. As youngsters, far away of marriage problems, the occurrences has made us feel uneasy and upset us.<br />  It's like we'd got an opportunity to take a glance at the future to come, only to become quite confused... I should stress that the film doesn't deal only with marriage,  there are more subjects on the agenda. Still, the main criteria is the familiy and the turmoils it goes through in our age - the materialistic,lonely,alienated,stressing age.<br />  It's a heavy film, burdensome and saddening. There are some moments of laughter , but the atmosphere is clearly the above. A memorable scene comes in the end, when a whole new outlook over death is presented, to my opinion the brightest ,but then again, the saddest moment in the film.<br />  To end with, I think that young folks shouldn't watch it, it will only confuse them as it confused me . For older ,I don't know ,maybe it represents some of their problems and dilema's. Anyway, it doesn't give a whole new remarkable point of view at these things, it only reflects the current status.
B000002699|5.0|I am not ashamed to say this- &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; has always been my favorite Miles Davis cd, bar none. For me, it has never been an issue. No other lp of his comes close.<br />I've never been able to completely pin down why that is, but it all starts with the MOOD. There is such a relaxed, ethereal feel to this lp that none of his others has. The mixing and mastering was brilliantly done on this lp. The lp is almost an ambient (as Brian Eno would describe ambient- soft, background music) experience at points, and the deliberate softer mixing of this lp causes that to happen. It creates a relaxed, almost stoned feel to the lp (which could also be part of the mood of the lp- I'm sure many of the players were dope smokers).<br />&quot;In a Silent Way/It's About That Time&quot; is for me the most beautiful piece of music Miles ever played. An early example of ambient music, the keyboards of Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock form the pattern. Tony Williams plays very simple drums, and John McLaughlin adds liquid guitar solos that neither dominate, or fall under,the mix. The result is several minutes of pure trance before the soloists- Shorter,then Miles, add to the spacial textures laid out. As would be more common in Miles' 70's works, the buildup to orgasmic climax is astounding, as Miles goes off on his tangent while Williams, Corea, and bassist Dave Holland go for the ride..then, as quickly as it starts, it ends, and the theme that opened the track re-enters and closes it. Breathtaking.<br />&quot;Shhh/Peaceful&quot; foreshadows the 70's funk fusion jazz that Corea, Hancock, and Shorter would all experiment with in their respective fusion groups. Great bass by Holland and suprelative drumming by Williams sets up the foundation for the groove, which allows Miles, Shorter, Hancock, and McLaughlin to experiment with tempos, forms of playing, and moods. The results are astounding. And, as with &quot;in a Silent way,&quot; the opening theme is again repeated for emphasis and for a trance like feel.<br />The group theme is becoming prevalent in Miles' muisc by this time, and its those grooves created by the rhythn section that carries this lp and allows Miles and Shorter to weave their magic. Without question on of the greatest lps ever made, &quot;In a Silent Way&quot; is new and fresh yet still very familiar and safe, as well.<br />The gem of all gems.
B00004W50T|5.0|With the heavy radio play of 'The Weight' and only a few other tunes from the ENTIRE Band Discography, im sure many people have written them off as a one or two hit wonder.  Fortunately, this is not the case. This CD is a pleasant enlightenment of what i assumed was what The Band was all about.<br />I lost alot of interest in &quot;Classic Rock&quot; after 1990, and with over 350 LP's i thought i had most everything i liked. Having a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD by The Band is not enough.  This CD defines for me what the Band was REALLY all about and im VERY glad i bought it.<br />This was a band that was far more important to music than most anyone would guess.  There is so much &quot;Counter-counter Culture&quot; here that it is not a surprise that the tracks, for the most part, never went over big with the music buying public. <br />However, breaking the status quo and doing it with consistent grace, skill, style and ambition (ala Duke Ellington?) is the secret to real artistry.  The Band checked in with a winner and you will realize this when you pop this CD in and become immersed into the depth color and atmosphere of the content.<br />One of the few 5 star ratings ive given on Amazon.  Perfect.
B000003S2K|5.0|I was 14 in 1984, and I remember laughing when I first saw the title to this lp- what is a Music for Airport, anyhow? (such a silly 14 year old thought) But I was intrigued by the concept, I saw one of my idols, Robert Wyatt, as a credit on the lp, and the lp was used, so for a mere .50, I ventured into the world of Brian Eno for the second time (I loved his Roxy Music works).<br />From the opening piano strokes of Wyatt, I was hooked. I couldn't listen to the lp enough. I listened to it at high volume,and at low volumes. At night; during the day; during rain; windy conditions; perfect calm. It didn't matter. The music transcended all conditions. I was amazed. I was (and still am) a huge Erik Satie fan, and Eno was the modern day Satie. The concepts were beautifully simple and effective, yet wreaked of sophisication. My friends at school were listening to Ratt and other 80s hair bands, and I was into Eno. They didn't get it. It was fine. Eno was mine.<br />Today, almost 16 years later, &quot;Music for Airports&quot; is one of the cornerstones of my musical identity. I have listened to it 1000's of times (as with all instrumental Eno lps), and still am amazed by the absolute simplicity of it. While Eno played with ambient soundscapes before (&quot;Discreet Music,&quot; Fripp and Eno's 2 recordings), none better encapsulated at the time what he was driving towards better than this lp (in my view, &quot;Ambient 4: On Land&quot; best encapsulates ambient music).<br />This lp is a gem of the highest calibre, and is a must in any reputable music collection. A must have.
B00003CX95|5.0|we saw it in the theater, and we loved it, we saw it on the silver screen and we loved it, now we can watch it and love it anytime we want to...
B000003S0R|5.0|This is one of Eno's more schzophrenic efforts, taking his loves for both out there rock and experimental musics and trying to fuse them together. It does not always work, but who cares? Its the effort that matters in such cases, and not so much the results (He would succeed more infinitely on &quot;Before and After Science&quot;).<br />This lp showcases all that Eno was/is- a restless experimentalist who was willing to stop at nothing in trying to achieve to sonically lay down what he heard in his mind. An amazing effort.
0790729628|2.0|You know, with all the information a DVD can hold, you think that Warner Brothers would have put some more into it besides: &quot;Interactive Menus&quot; .... ooooo! Can't get enough of those... It would be nice if, say, the original voiceover on the non-director's cut was available on a seperate audio channel, or if the non-director's cut was on the other side of the DVD. The movie is, of course, a masterpiece that looks beautiful in the DVD format. If that's all you want, the DVD is perfect. However, if you're a Blade Runner fan or simply love the extras on DVDs, you'll feel like I do; that there is so much more that could have been added to this DVD: like deleted scenes or a &quot;making of&quot; feature or even a couple of original movie trailers... but no, just some &quot;interactive menus&quot;... disappointing...
B000002AH7|5.0|It can never be said that Miles Davis was not a risk taker. Following the amazing success of his 1st great quintet and the soon to be classic &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; Miles Davis was on top of the jazz world. Yet, as always, Miles followed his muse, which took him to old friend and long time collaborator Gil Evans, and to what became one of his more misunderstood and least jazz offerings, &quot;Sketches of Spain.&quot;<br />To call this lp a &quot;jazz&quot; lp is incorrect, for it is more than that. They are sonic textures, playing with flamenco style music in a large orchestral format. While Miles is the featured artist on flugelhorn, it is the whole orchestra that makes this lp shine. Miles would revisit this concept increasingly by the late 60's and certainly during his 70's works.<br />Some critics dismiss this lp as overblown elevator muzak type of music. This, too, is incorrect. The music has way too much soul to be pigeonholed into such a nasty category.<br />Unlike anything he did before or since, &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; is a small microcosm into the vast landscape of not just Miles Davis, but of jazz itself. How much &quot;smooth&quot; jazz today uss these same concepts?! As always, Miles was years ahead of his time.
630588255X|5.0|I first saw this movie in 1971 when I was in high school.  I bought it as soon as VHS was available.  I've gone through several copies between viewing it myself and loaning it out to countless people.  Black comedy?  Sure, but also the most uplifting, nonreligious, feelgood movie I've ever come across.  The passage of thirty years' changes in cars, clothes, etc., only makes it seem more camp.  I really hope no one tries to remake this, can't be done.  For its type, it is as close to perfect as it gets.

B00000HYXB|5.0|A remarkable retelling of JRR Tolkien's &quot;Silmarillion&quot;, _Nightfall in Middle Earth_ transports you to a wonderful fantasy land with their trademark medieval sound, thick vocal layers, and great heavy-metal-minstrel like guitar parts.  There are even short narrator-type, story-line pieces used to link the songs together.  My only complaint with the album is that it never really slows down enough to let you catch your breath.  Still, everything on this album from music to lyrics to production is top notch.
B00000JCB2|5.0|This album is the best if u find fred durst and his great band the best you will totally enjoy this. It was the best buy I have ever had and I cant wait to get the new album which promises to be even better than this one.
B00000IP3S|3.0|This album starts off headed in the right direction with the magnificent title-track, but from there it seems to fall a little flat.  The overall song-writing just doesn't seem to compare to the stuff on the other two albums I have from them (_Nightfall in Middle Earth_ and _Somewhere Far Beyond_).  Hansi's vocals are as cool as ever, and the musicianship is right on par with their other releases, but the great songs just aren't there.  I was surprised at this, because before _Nightfall in Middle Earth_ came out I saw a lot of people list this album as Blind Guardian's best.  Apparently my expectations were too high.  Not to sound too greatly displeased, however, it's still a good album, but I would definitely pick up both _Nightfall in Middle Earth_ and _Somewhere Far Beyond_ first.
B00000263T|5.0|Accept does it again! Another great effort! Catchy riffs and that classic german metal sound! All the songs are good and have their own character. If you like 'traditional metal' this is a great album to add to your collection!
B000002AZ8|4.0|I've always like this cd.  When it came out, people said it was weird and quirky, but I say wonderfully so.  Last Exit's clamouring guitars and catchy chorus are simply lovely.  Even though Not For You is a bit whiny, it has a flowing burn.  Tremor Christ, to me, is a great one to sing along with, showing how E.V. has probably the greatest voice ever.  Right down to Satan's Bed the band embraces all the weird vibes that this cd was supposed to deliver.  I don't care if this album helped to get rid of the high-fivin' bone heads that didn't get the full message.  To them I say, see you at a Matchbox 12 concert (although I won't be there).
B000002JS0|4.0|My quintessential homemade AC/DC tape is &quot;High Voltage&quot; backed with &quot;Back In Black.&quot;  Funnily enough, I didn't even hear this record until 1986, when a college friend introduced me to it.  The first side (I heard it on cassette the first time, so I still think that way) is pure mindless fun rock at its best, including the immortal &quot;Live Wire&quot; and &quot;Long Way To The Top&quot;.  The second side does drag a bit, which keeps it a notch below the classic &quot;Back In Black.&quot;  In my opinion, the best Bon Scott AC/DC album--yes, even better than &quot;Highway To Hell.&quot;
B000002BFZ|5.0|If this cd was the one that was really considered 'out there', then that is where I want to be.  Sometimes is such a beautiful ditty (and a great opener for a concert), Hail, Hail &amp; Habit are great rockers entwined with other songs so rich with texture that I wonder 'How can they make music this perfect?'.  In My Tree has such a great rhythm underneath far away vocals and rich guitar.  Present Tense shows how E.V. can be inspired vocally while the end of the song is a pure celebration of great art.  And who could forget the serene lullaby of Around the Bend...a great way to end an album.  This effort is a tour de force of how a band can take control of their own direction and experiment without any regrets or questions.  Probably one of my favorites, and to people who think that Ten is a better album I wonder if they are willing to grow with the band, you can't be 19 forever.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen was a band that pretty much singlehandedly changed the face of rock.  Combining Eddie Van Halen's stunning virtuosity with the flamboyant antics of frontman David Lee Roth, they reset the standards for hard rock.  Their self-titled debut is another one of those rare albums that does not have one bad track on it, and has stood the test of time far better than their other works.  Even non-VH diehards should know this album pretty well, since classic rock radio rotates about 60% of it.  This is the essential Van Halen album--I would recommend it over any of their other albums and even their greatest hits package for newcomers (i.e. anyone who still has a -teen in their age).  It's a fun album to listen to, Dave never sounded better, and Eddie absolutely shreds.  Another one of my desert island disks without question.  Buy two copies so you'll have a backup when you wear the first one out!
0871137380|5.0|I saw the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and must say I liked.  However, we must remember that it was only a movie.  If one wants to learn about an actual &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, true heroism, and the real meaning of dedication to duty, one must read this book. This is not a movie, but reality.
B000002JS6|5.0|&quot;Back In Black&quot; has been a mainstay in my record/CD collection since my teen years.  No meaningful lyrics, no guitar pyrotechnics, no fancy stuff--just booming drums, piercing vocals, and monster riffs that will have the most dyed-in-the-wool heavy metal hater giving the devil sign, banging his head, and bellowing &quot;ANGUS! &quot; at the top of his lungs.  This CD never fails to bring a smile to my face.  Yet another desert island disk for me, and the title track is one of my all-time top ten.  If you don't like this, you either have no sense of humor or you're dead.  Three chords and a beat never sounded better!
B00004X01U|4.0|Ok , first of all im NOT a big fan of popish music ( i can't stand anything done by N'Sync, Britney S. or  BSB ) but I can make an exception for Madonna, I own all her albums , because quite frankley she doesn't make any bad ones , in fact her worst selling album ( Erotica )  had sold over 8 million copies!! which is way beyond just being platium. So here is my review of each of her songs , hope this will help! Music- I think mostly everyone who is a fan of her has heard this song by now , it isn't the best one on this cd , but it has a good beat , and you can't help but dance to it so i'll give it a 9/10 Impressive Instant-This is one of those very tecno songs ,that moves by very fast ,  it also has a good beat. 7/10 Runaway Lover- For some reason to me, this song sounds just like it came off her Ray of Light album , so if you liked that album  you should check out this song. It is also very catchy. 8/10 I Deserve It- Probley one of the best songs on the whole album. It is not as popish as her other songs. You can't really dance to this one but you can't help but listen to it. 10/10 Amazing- This one moves buy really fast and has a good beat,  but after listening to it for more than a couple of times it can get real annoying. 6/10 Nobody's Perfect- This song starts out really wierd, and sounds at first like Cher's Belive ( in fact a lot of the songs do ). But after  the first 10 seconds it terns out to be really good so i'll give it a 9/10 Don't Tell Me- This song sounds good at first with the gutairs and violins combained with tecno, defanitly worth a listen. What it fells like for a girl- Another great song!! This is one of those songs you could listen to over and over in a long plane or car trip and never get tired of it!! It is also one of those songs which can be very Britney Spears and still be taken seriously. 10/10 Paradise (not for me)- This is a very serious song that someone would probley listen to when they are depressed. It is a very haunting song butstill very beautiful.If you liked the songs on her &quot; Next Best Thing Soundtrack&quot; you will like this one.  9/10 Gone-This one is okay ,not my favorite, but still worth a listen. 5/10
1558803602|3.0|A hot shot dare devil pilot just loves to take chances in fighting fires. His best friend and his &quot;girl&quot; are chatterboxes who verbally spar with one another until ad naseum. Our hero decides to take one chance to many an the predictable happens. He leaves &quot;his girl&quot; in total grief and his best friend stunned. Oh, and he failed to tell &quot;his girl&quot; that he loves her.<br />     You have three good actors and a predictable, sappy story which even they can't rescue. Sure, the scenes are great and the action good but the story never gets off the ground. Our hero's return to say goodbye makes you want to say so what? Holly Hunter's character was not convincing. She sounds like a hot shot one moment and then a little girl the next. Even Dreyfuss and Goodman didn't pull off their roles convincingly as dare devil pilots. The best that can be said for this film is that it falls flat though it had great potential with some fine actors. It is an average run of the mill B movie which is good for a rainy or snowy day.
B00004Y635|5.0|Scream 3 was so good!  I loved the line: &quot;I wouldn't want to be friends with you, Sidney.  Becuase if you're friends with Sidney, you die!&quot;  I also love the movie that makes fun of this movie: Scary Movie.  IT'S VERY FUNNY!
B00003XACV|5.0|It is a little known fact that there are two different soundtracks for the film &quot;American Beauty&quot;. There is the rock version, which contains songs fro various artists, and then there is the pure score, composed by Thomas Newman. I would tell you that if you are going to buy one version, buy the score. Thomas Newman is an amazing composer (Little Women, Shawshank redemption, How to Make an American Quilt, Meet Joe Black), and this is by far one of the highlights of his composing career. He uses percussion and strings in such an original way that the music actually makes you think. The best part about the score is that it will directly transport you back to the movie, but if you have never seen the film the music is still beautiful. It is really one of the best scores out there right now. It is great for driving, falling asleep, or just sitting down and listening to. I reccommend it highly.
6304362498|5.0|This movie is probably the best adaptation of a book to screen that I've ever seen in my life. The acting is simply stunning: John Hurt should had get an oscar for this and Richard Burton is great, as usual. It's a shame that this movie its not available. Actually I think that this film should be part of any educational system based on freedom, just to show everyone what a political system based on the so called &quot;social justice&quot;(a good excuse for any totalitarianism) can do to the individual.
0380002930|5.0|What's amazing about this book is that you can be anyone to enjoy it. If your a reader from the age of 13 to 95 you will find it hard to put this book down. The characterization of these rabbits are more multidementional than humans in most fiction. A well thought out, wonderfully paced book that will pass from generation to generation. Give this book to your children and grandparents alike. No one should miss the opportunity of reading this wonderful tale.
B000021XS0|5.0|After a not so bright album, Dream Theater are back on track with a perfect masterpiece. From the first note to the final one, this album represents an exciting piece as well as a chilling mystery story. As always, Dream Theater succeed in renovating their style and demonstrating their superior technique. This is, by far, the band's best album yet. The only flaw of this album is that it ends to soon... Enjoy.
B000001EYW|5.0|&quot;Still Waters&quot; is one of my favorite  records from the Bee Gees,from the top 40 hit,&quot;Alone,&quot; to the magical&quot;Smoke and Mirrors,&quot; you will fall in love with this CD.The greatest cut is &quot;Irresistible force.&quot; The brothers trade vocals all over this number,and its unbelievable.There's not one song you have to skip over on this tape.If you like the Bee Gees,you will love this tape.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I loved this film. The film got terrible reviews over here in Britain but it just shows they are not always correct. The film was a never ending rush of fast cars and brilliant action sequences. Nicholas Cage was brilliant as always, as was Giovanni Rubisi who has not had the recognition he deserves. Angelina Jolie was good although her part didn't do her justice. Overall a very enjoyable film that could be watched over and over again.
B00004U2HK|4.0|I am afraid that describing the joys and disappointments of this film are a bit like solving a problem like Maria.Joyous, reverent and Broadway...Corny and saturated.  Definitely like holding a moonbeam in your hand.  First off,  I finally have figured out the appeal of Julie Andrews.  First off, she is a fabulous singer, and actor.  Her variety of performance between this and Mary Poppins in wonderfully broad in a subtle way.  But let me talk for a moment about her work in Do Re Mi.  If you read any of my reviews you will know that I tend to get swayed by small moments.  Well, Julie's commitment to the song and the performance of Do Re Mi is fabulous.  But especially amazing is the last section where she is running with the seven kids in a tunnel of vines.  Julie is running her hind end off.  This is no star performance.  This is a performer willing to give.  For this reason The Sound of Music works, and for the infectious first half, I would give five stars.The corn element works.  The kids have treacly, sappy choreography.  The boys are particularly musical theatrey.  But this stuff works...and is the musical.  The second half, the romantic, poltical half really seems to be devoid of charm.  Once the romance and politics is added it just gets fuzzy and focusless.  The wonderful score is almost devoid in the second half(except for Climb Every Mountain ) and relies on reprises, and an extremely weird reprise of Maria, sung in march time at her wedding.  But there is enough in the first section to really make this worthwhile.  Is this film a flibetty gibbit or a wave upon the sand?  Yes and more.  Check it out, and decided for yourself.  But see it just for watching Julie Run
1878424319|2.0|This book was very disappointing.  I think the 4 agreements are great guidelines to live by.  However, the book itself does a poor job of expanding on the ideas.  The content of the book would fit nicely into a magazine article.  Also, I found the writing to be somewhat poor.  The thing I liked most about the book was the cover!
0385043805|4.0|To be blunt, &quot;Rebecca&quot; is a romance and a murder mystery rolled into one. Just to make sure, I must tell you that I never read romances. I did however make an exception for this book due to its unique qualities.<br />&quot;Rebecca&quot; isn't a very romantic book at first. Our young, gauche heroine (whose name is never actually given) is suddenly proposed marriage by the brooding owner of the beautiful estate of Manderley, Maximilian de Winter. Her mind is abuzz - what does this dark brooding man find in her - a young, maladroit nobody - but cautiously accepts his offer and moves to his enourmous estate.<br />At this point the book gains something akin to momentum: the entire body of the great palace is permeated by the influence of Maximilian's late wife - Rebecca, and our heroine lives in her shadow, far too afraid to confide in her distanced husband. She feels that everyone is scrutinizing her - relatives, servants; in her mind she constantly compares herself to Rebecca - a brilliant, charismatic woman everyone loved to death - but was that all there was to her?<br />If this book is beginning to sound interesting to you - take caution. I can't say that it's not a masterpiece - but the plot moves very slowly and the pages are peppered with vivid descriptions and confusing sentence structures. Also, several others who read the book expressed concerns that several of the characters aren't fully developed (something I never noticed), and that the relationships between the major characters aren't as realistic as they would like (a claim that is at least partly true).<br />If you want to read a quality romance that isn't cliche and has appeal to fans of other genres, you might wish to give &quot;Rebecca&quot; a chance.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Gone in 60 seconds not only makes you want to drive at high speeds with nice cars and feel the breeze in your hair, but actually does it for you. Seeing this film 4 times in the theater, it got better everytime, the cinematography, directing, and script that fit right in with the 200 mph car chases. Nicolas Cage was perfect for the role, giving the best line readings to what could have been a very dull script. Overall a great action installment that makes you wanna get in that porsche 911 turbo and gas it all the way
B000002E5J|5.0|Okay, so maybe she's not selling out by releasing songs now in english- but I felt betrayed when I first found out. Shakira is a gift from Colombia, and this album &quot;pies descalzos&quot;- her best in Spanish, now holds a big place in my heart. Maybe I'll start by describing the state of the CD case in which this album is held. Because of listening to this over and over again, carrying it with me from continent to continent, dropping it while singing and grooving along to the lyrics tucked inside, lending it to close friends- and full out CHERISHING it- the CD case is broken, stained, and fully broken in.  While living in South America, and exploring all the exotic venues of music- Shakira fell into my lap one day and it never left my Stereo. Before long- you will be shouting out the lyrics and grooving in your seat- songs like &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; and &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; have the type of melody and lyrical quality that they will surely pop into your head even years after listening to them, and add some groove to a lonely bus or subway ride. The majority of the songs are about lost love and dealing with the avalanche of emotions of heartbreak in a positive manner.  If you're heart is feeling a little sad- and in need of some nourishment- slide this CD into the nearest stereo- and enjoy! This CD would also be great to listen to while exercising- cuz it'll give you the hope to reach that extra mile.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Words can hardly express what Moby has done to music coming into a new decade.  Moby has inspired thousands of people to look beyond there normal window of musical vision.  Play has turned mothers, fathers, children and other cultures into eclectic music lovers.  Music is suppose to move you or reflect a mood and I can tell you Moby has created a masterpeice that has touched many people, myself included.  It's simplistic nature is the true genius and I can not imagine ever getting sick of it.
B00003CX95|5.0|U can't go wrong adding Braveheart to your collection. This is a fantasic movie. The fight scenes are awesome and the story of William Wallace's fight for freedom is inspiring. There's also a love story with-in this one, BraveHeart has it all!! One of my top 10 movies of all time...a new classic
0446604844|1.0|The main female character in Total Control, Sidney, is a senior partner in a major law firm but spends most of the book acting like a 14 year old. If another partner speaks to her in a way she doesn't like, she gives them a cold look and doesn't &quot;grace them&quot; with a response. Sidney would have trouble holding down a job as a receptionist, much less a senior partner. If Baldacci had made her smack her gum a few more times, she could easily have gone undercover in a junior high school.<br />Baldacci has Inspector Clousseau's eye for detail. In one early scene on page 85, two characters meet at the site of an airplane crash, and Baldacci sets a new record for cramming the most inconsistencies into a single paragraph. Baldacci describes the daylight as &quot;rapidly failing,&quot; but Lee Sawyer shows up wearing sunglasses, perhaps because in Baldacci's junior-high world on-duty cops are required to wear sunglasses at all times. George Kaplan &quot;freezes&quot; when he sees Sawyer then squints to try to make out who that person is a &quot;bare five feet away.&quot; I can usually identify people from 5 feet away, but then again, I don't squint to see in the dark; I open my eyes wider. When Sawyer steps forward, Kaplan is able to identify him--from about two feet away by my reckoning--which is probably pretty good for someone who's squinting in the dark.<br />Baldacci attended the Archie Bunker school of word choice, and selects his words more for what they sound like than what they mean. He has characters \\"alight into\\" a car. (You can't alight \\"into\\" a car; you can only alight \\"out of\\" a car.) Kaplan squints in the \\"rapidly failing\\" light. \\"Failing?\\" How about \\"fading?\\" On page 378 (which is almost as dense with hilarious inconsistencies as page 85), Baldacci reports that \\"a twitch erupted over Sidney's left eye.\\" A twitch can't erupt. A twitch is minor. A \\"spasm\\" could erupt. How about just writing \\"Her left eyelid twitched?\\" Later, \\"Sidney struggled mightily not to perceptibly wince at the remark.\\" Aside from the split infinitive, I think it would be as easy to notice a woman \\"struggling mightily\\" as to notice her wincing \\"perceptibly.\\" Still further down the page, \\"Sidney felt herself trembling.\\" What's does Baldacci mean by that? Did she reach out with one hand and feel the other hand trembling, or did she \\"notice\\" rather than \\"feel\\" that she was trembling? Throughout the book, most things happen &quot;suddenly&quot; as in &quot;Steve suddenly criticized Baldacci's book on amazon.com.&quot;<br />The book is written almost exclusively in the passive voice. The sentence construction is truly impressive in that you would never think it was possible to twist certain words into a passive formation: &quot;Sidney's legs were put by her into the front of the car.&quot; Weird things happen with people's legs throughout the book. Lee Sawyer walks on &quot;telephone pole size legs&quot; (presumably Baldacci is referring to thickness, not length). In one scene, Baldacci says &quot;Sidney's legs began walking down the street.&quot; (We never learn where the rest of her went in that particular scene.)<br />This book requires the reader to suspend his or her disbelief, and in that it excels. You will be able to practice suspending your disbelief in laws of physics, human nature, business practices,  legal procedings, police procedure, modern computing, and virtually every other topic Baldacci addresses.<br />After reading the first 10 pages, I was surprised that the book had been published at all. After the first 50, I kept reading for the amusement of seeing characters that were so silly and a plot that was so contrived -- and because other people on the airplane had taken all the more literary reading material, such as Seventeen and Tiger Beat magazines.<br />After 250 pages, I squinted my eyes and suddenly became convinced that Baldacci was 15 or 16 years old. The author changes voice and tense frequently, but mostly writes in third person omniscient. Readers are given full access to every thought every character in the book has for the duration of the adventure, and most of those are at the junior high level. If you read the book as a description of junior high school students role playing attorneys, FBI agents, computer programmers, and so on, it actually makes a lot of sense. Reinforcing my guess, Baldacci's word choices are mostly at about the 5th grade level, but every 3 or 4 pages he throws in a word like &quot;brook,&quot; as in &quot;Sidney's telephone-pole sized legs would brook no thought of walking down the street.&quot; I concluded that Baldacci was studying for the SAT as he wrote this book and worked in a lot of the words from his SAT study guide.<br />I didn't make it all the way to the ending, but I imagine it ends something like this:<br />Sidney's eyelids were made to coolly squint at the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. &quot;Miranda Shmiranda,&quot; she extemporized. Her hand suddenly slapped the Chief Justice on the lower left side of his cheek. The Chief Justice immediately froze and winked with pain. &quot;That will show him to deny my appeal,&quot; she thought to herself, smacking her gum as her legs walked down Wall Street and off into the sunset.in third person omniscient.

B000002UAR|5.0|Those who dismiss this album are either displaying bad taste or just attempting to be provocative. Since Revolver was recorded technology may have improved. But the creativity,inventiveness and stylistic diversity apparent on this album have yet to be equaled. I first heard this album in 1986. I could sit down right now and listen to it front to back and would be as bedazzled as I was 14 years ago--if not more so. This is the pinnacle of the Beatles career and the first thing I would grab if my house were on fire.
B000002LGQ|5.0|A pop album thats speaks about sociatal hang ups? Only madonna is capable of such a feat. On the title track and &quot;The Act of Contrision&quot; she explores the drama of religon. And on the most powerfully lyrical pop song ever &quot;Till Death Do Us Part&quot; in which you can dance to the tale of domestic violence... Brillant definetly...Conventional... Never!!!
B000002J2F|5.0|Duke was Genesis' transition. A clear vision of what was to come, with enough remnants of past progressiveness. It was the first tour I saw Genesis - a band well renowned for their live shows. The combination of the magical sounds of Genesis music, and their flare for an over-all musical experience in a live performance making for what to this day is still one of my best concert experiences. <br />Duke opens with a bang, the powerful punch of &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, a perfect choice given it's inclusion of all that made Genesis best music so great - the blast from Tony Banks keyboards, the power driven drums of Phil Collins, and the inmistakable guitar of Genesis' Mike Rutheford, duplicated perfectly live by Darryl Struermer. &quot;Duchess&quot;, one of my favorite Genesis songs of all time, tells the simple tale of the rise and fall of a rock star, with power and conviction - the changes in the songs force emphasizing the journey-like feeling that the song's title character is experiencing. In these two songs - which feed and blend perfectly from one into the next, Genesis again sets the table for the extremes their fans have grown to expect, and can again expect on &quot;Duke&quot;. &quot;Alone Again&quot; and &quot;Please Don't Ask&quot; demonstrate the pain still left in Phil Collins' heart from his failed marriage. One or both are remnants of writings from his first solo effort, &quot;Face Value&quot;. Pull them out of &quot;Duke&quot; and plug them into &quot;Face&quot; and you'll see they're a perfect fit. Clearly, Collins has mastered the art of the pop, power ballad, something the heartbroken are most adept at, and will use that knack for future solo and Genesis efforts, for better or worse. &quot;Man of Our Times, Cul-de sac&quot;, and &quot;Duke's Travels-Duke's End&quot; demonstrate the joint efforts of the bands creativity - each member bringing their own stamp to what many of the band's members have said was their best collective effort, &quot;Duke's Travels-Duke's End&quot; provides the CD with Genesis trademark, powerful instrumental jam that exploits each members unique contributions to Genesis fame. This CD has a lot of flavor to it. It shows Genesis ability to still create their adventure-like tracks, though the attentive ear and eye will find most notably missing from this CD is Genesis knack for creating a desireable British feel. That alone is a transition in itself. The whimsical feeling of the British experience in songs like &quot;Wind and Weathering's&quot;, song &quot;Blood on the Rooftops&quot; will no longer be found from this point on, something many a listener could count on and tend to lose themselves in while popping in Genesis CDs of the past. That alone pointed them in the direction of more Americanized, more pop-assembly line tunes, if you will. <br />While a repeat of &quot;Duke&quot; would have shown limits to their creativity, no one would have faulted them for it, even if that choice were at the cost of increased CD sales, something many fans blamed them for in directing them in other musical directions. What could have stood out in the 80s - a decade when standing out was even more permitted than in the past - soon fell into the abyss of blandness in many minds. Genesis would soon be described as something that simply didn't stand out enought to excuse their dependence on keyboards for their music (ala Depeche Mode), something that was granted from &quot;Duke&quot; on back given the bands creativity and power.<br />Future Genesis CDs and concerts would pale by comparison to Duke. While both used to offer enough flavor from both ends of Genesis creative spectrum and career, latter Genesis productions didn't. Which makes listening to the richness of Duke all the more of an experience. There's something about seeing or hearing something that was, and never will be again. Even while you savor it, there's a sadness experienced as well. Duke is a real musical experience, true to Genesisthemselves.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has done it again, she knows how to move forward in her music.  She takes Mirwais' French electronica even further, uses a bit of old school 80s, and manages to bring in folk music.  Unbelievable.  Here's my reviews of the standouts:<br />MUSIC: short, simple, fun dance hit, already a #1 hit, bound to be a Maddy classic.  9.5/10<br />IMPRESSIVE INSTANT:  very weird track but wonderful club track.  Her entire voice is all filtered and vocoded in the most weirdest ways imaginable.  The lyrics aren't all that, but the production work is wonderful.  Maybe too avant-garde to release to radio, but then again so was &quot;Music&quot;.   9/10<br />RUNAWAY LOVER:  okay, good club track.  Somehow this reminds me of Cher's &quot;Strong Enough&quot;.  There's something kinda 70s-ish about this song.   7.5/10<br />I DESERVE IT:  slow ballad where Madonna discusses her love for her current boyfriend.  Mirwais uses little electronica and this is where the album becomes folky.   7/10<br />AMAZING:  Maddy teams up with Orbit again on this really cool dance track.  While many say it's Beautiful Stranger Pt.2, it takes the sessions of ROL and Beautiful Stranger even further.  The guitar hooks and effects are great, and Madonna's lyrics are very catchy.    9/10<br />NOBODY'S PERFECT:  Remember Cher's vocals on &quot;Believe&quot;, well Maddy's vocals on here are 100 times more stranger.  This is a sad, emotional ballad with some slower sound effects.  8.5/10<br />DON'T TELL ME:  Wonderfully catchy song that emobides folk, electronica/techno, and even R&amp;B.  Madonna's vocals on here are good enough, very upbeat and harmonizing.  Love the parts where Madonna sings without the music background.  Would make a great second single.    9.5/10<br />WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL:  Lyrically this is Madonna's best track on the album.  A young girl's anthem on lessons in life by a woman who's been through it all and back.  The production on this is also a bit slower, but otherwise a nice track.   8/10<br />PARADISE (NOT FOR ME):  A very long ballad where Madonna mostly whispers her lyrics, some even in French.  And her voice is vocoded while singing.  The lyrics are quite ambiguous, and the song is very slow and haunting.  Kind of like &quot;Mer-Girl&quot;.   7.5/10<br />GONE:  great closer to this album.  Just one guitar, and some mid-tempo production with Orbit again.  Lyrically and vocally Madonna is very cold and dry, and it works wonders for her.  Too bad it's so short, it leaves you wanting more.   9.5/10

6305265488|5.0|This is the kind of movie that no self-respecting guy would admit to liking in front of his friends. Seeing as i have no self-respect and even fewer friends, i have no reservations in stating that i loved this one from start to finish. It is a clever and highly original retelling of the classic Cinderella story, set in France. The entire cast does an inspired job. Drew Barrymore hasn't been this endearing since &quot;E.T.&quot; (or was it &quot;Doppelganger&quot; ? I keep confusing the two), Anjelica Huston is a fittingly loathsome stepmother and even the featured &quot;prince charming&quot; i found easy to stomach. Need i recount the (allegedly true) tale ? (daughter turned lowly servant turned pretend courtier turned princess) Check elsewhere !<br />The pre-feminist subtext is hard to overlook, but far from obtrusive. Couldn't help liking the not so evil second stepsister. No fantastic elements are introduced: there is no evidence of sorcery, or a pumpkin anywhere to be found. Replacing the fairy godmother with Leonardo da Vinci of all people is a stroke of genius, adding to the credibility of the storyline. The payoff is thoroughly satisfactory, leaving you with a smile on your face. My fellow countryman Jeroen Krabbé (Barrymore's father) sees his acting career cut short as he is killed off within the first five minutes or so. The whole thing is accompanied by a great music score. Set aside your prejudice &amp; suspend your disbelief. This is 1 hour and 57 minutes well spent !
0446677450|4.0|I was really floored by this book, because it presents an unique and wonderful philosophy of not just investing, but rather a way of life. The book compels you not to make mistakes that you would normally do, get out of the &quot;rat race&quot; and into the &quot;fast track&quot;.  But, it think Kiyosaki's principles are too risky, and although this book contains gems of wisdom, do not use it as an investement guide.
B000002UAU|5.0|Singer/Songwriter/Producer Madonna would be proud of these Brits.<br />This album is right up there with her work.  Especially the 'Like A Prayer' album.<br />Shines with brilliance.<br />Good Goin Beatles!  <br />Respect.
0783117388|4.0|Are we doomed to have to order cable to see &quot;Sex in the City&quot;?  Is it possible to avoid the agonizing and empty wait for the cable guy to install an overpriced service that still pads programming with tons of commercials?  Are the talk and all the awards lavished on the cable show all hype and glitz?  I decided to order the complete collection of the first season of &quot;Sex in the City&quot; and check it out.<br />It is hilarious, surprising, urbane and enlightening.  I was expecting fruit for thought and got a delicious and earthy light meal with lots of chocolate and sparkling wine for desert.  It is a fun and a real observation of the single world that is out there and how it views the current sexual mores, the foibles of the urban psychological landscape, and the married world.  The writing and performances are fresh and explore the Manhattan of Candace Bushnell's columns with honesty, charm, and stylish shoes. Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie), Kim Cattrall (Samantha), Kristin Davis (Charlotte), and Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) are a spicy ensemble that are (Middle English word for procreation) funny.  The cable guy can hook me up later.  The memory of the first episode's scene where &quot;Big&quot; delicious responds to Carrie's question, &quot;Have you ever been in love before?&quot;, will sustain me until I can see the next episodes.<br />My next review for Amazon.com will be, &quot;How long can a viewer wait for a successful online store to stock the second and following seasons of &quot;Sex in the City?&quot;<br />The VHS format provided enjoyable viewing.
B00004X01U|3.0|Like most Madonna fans I was awaiting the next album. My first reaction was, there is only 10 tracks?  I would have liked at least a couple more.  I did like a few of them, and some may grow on me.  I hope a few more are made into videos.  I guess I like it enough, but nothing really made me go WOW!!!!  If you are a madonna fan you will buy this regardless, but if not dont hurry. Given time I may change my mind, but right now I am only saying PLEASE MADONNA DONT WAIT TOO LONG FOR THE NEXT ALBUM!  WE NEED MORE MUSIC!
0800136586|1.0|Yes, I know there are people that love this movie, but they clearly did not see the Broadway version or hear the music from the cd with Andrea McArdle. This is an action paced movie and it probably appeals to those who like that kind of stuff, but for those of us who know something about music and are familiar with the original know that this is inferior. Read the bad reviews of this movie and that is what I think. Should have not left out some of the songs, should have not taken place 4th of July. I love Carol Burnett and she does do a good job in this, but a little too drunk. I think the writers overdid it. Don't rememberher being so much in the play. I wrote a review of the Disney version and it the Disney version is better than this mess, but not as good as the Broadway Version with Andrea McArdle. I haven't seen it, but I was in a local production with the Broadway version. They should have made Bernadette Peters a ditsy blonde in this, but she comes off too smart. They kept her ditsy in the Disney Version. I will have to say that the Disney Version should have not had a black love interest for Daddy Warbucks. I'm not trying to be racist but it just doesn't make sense for the Depression era to have a mixed relationship.  They should have gotten Rebecca Luker(Miriam the Librarian on Broadway and a friend of mine. She would have been perfect for Grace.Not too impressed with Ann Reinking in this version as Grace. At least Audra McDonald in the Disney version can sing the way it should be. Ann is more of a dancer. If you have never seen the Broadway version or heard the original or seen the Disney version you might like this, but it is inferior to the original. So save your money and buy the Disney version and buy the Andrea McArdle version on cd. Too bad that version is not on tape.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|I was waiting for this movie for a long time, and i was not one bit dissapointed. It is the funniest movie i have ever seen, better than American Pie and Theres Something About Mary. Imagin watching those 2 movies and laughing 10 times more. There are alot of dick jokes and fart jokes to please anyone. Buy it you wont regret it!
0316777722|5.0|Possibily Sedaris' BEST work in conversational masterpieces.  So funny I couldn't read at times.  I would recommend this book before Naked, as Naked was not as focused as Me Talk Pretty..
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna's *Immaculate Collection* is one of those must-haves.  This belongs in everyone's collection; it's the type of CD you can play from beginning to end, without skipping tracks.  Every song is a gem; it includes her dance and pop hits, as well as ballads.  And another great thing about it - you'll know all the songs, and can sing along.  Pick this up.
B00000J7JO|5.0|BUY THIS CD OR YOUR MISSING OUT
B000002N3J|4.0|If you have loved and enjoyed Madonna's music through all her musical periods, don't miss out on this album.  It includes some of her best pop and soft ballads.  Many times Madonna's music is in the shadows of her life and behavior.  But songs on the album like 'Take a Bow', 'Rain,' 'I'll Remember,' 'You'll See,' 'This Used to be my Playground,' and 'Forbidden Love' remind you of how great her music is.  The only reason I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 is because it includes 'Crazy for You' and 'Live to Tell,' while both are good, are included on 'The Immaculate Collection' album; I thought she could have included other songs instead.  All in all, it's terrific.
B000005RFQ|2.0|What a mess ! This thing sounds like it was tossed together in a day ! Horrendous sound, dumb lyrics (example: &quot;The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away/We're disturbing the priest, come to our feast&quot; can we say Kindergarden). Gillian's voice sounds shot,Ward is just too messed up to play anymore by this point,Butler can't be heard amongst the murky production, even the glorious riffmeister Iommi god can't pull this one out of banality. Reportedly this union was put together by management and lawyers. The result is something that is hard to believe it could have been created by such legendary musicians. No small wonder this Sabb was short lived and the original vinyl was headed straight to the cutout bin.
0030839939|5.0|Ashcroft and Mermin is an &quot;amplified&quot; version of basic solid state book! Must have!<br />This book offers an excellent, step-by-step introduction to crucial concepts of solid-state physics. I think, the authors have nicely avoided &quot;reasoning surprises&quot; that usually bother novice readers. To read this book smoothly, certainly you need &quot;Physics 101&quot; background; but other than that, the book seems to be self-contained. But don't be surprised if the problems are quite challenging (some are tough)!<br />The development of solid-state physics is presented in a more historical fashion--in opposition to rigid, systematic, definitive, and (sometimes) boring way that is commonly adopted by many other solid-state books.<br />In my opinion (hopefully wrong), this book has some shortcomings:<br />(1) detailed technical aspects, e.g. in XRD--you must refer to other technical books if you want to delve into them.<br />(2) links to interesting, research-related topics in modern solid state physics.<br />(3) new editions since the first release (how come?? Solid state physics has grown rapidly!).<br />These are probably due to the the introductory nature of this book. But it is good if there is a future revision, with point (2) above added in it, at least in the form of problems.
B00003CXDF|1.0|The previews were misleading.  They played Biskit and Metallica while running the action sequences, and I said to myself, &quot;Ok, maybe it will be a good action/spy movie - but hopefully not a James Bond kind of thing.<br />I didn't hope enough.  First, I'll start with the &quot;action&quot; scenes.  I saw 99% of them on the TV previews.  And they were all lame.  I don't know what Woo was thinking.  They were flat-out lame - worse than the Bond movies (which are dumb in my view).  The worse action scene was probably the beach fight, which was dragged out waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay toooooo long.  And what is with Cruise kicking the gun out of the sand and into his hand, then turning around and shooting the &quot;villain&quot;?  Lame.  Just lame.  I started laughing in the theater - and so did many other people.  So much for the &quot;action movie&quot; theme.  I kept waiting for the movie to take off - kept waiting for the big actoin stuff that everyone said the movie had.  It never came.  Also, the masks and voice chips were used at least a half-dozen times, and it just got ridiculous.<br />Now we'll move onto the plot and acting.  What plot?  As far as I could tell, there was this virus and Cruise and the what's-his-nose-bad guy play this mind game with the anti-venum.  The dialogue is slow and poorly written.  The &quot;love&quot; story is quite lame.  The movie would have been better if Nyah would have shot herself while inside the laboratory.  But sadly, Woo was too dumb to make one of the good-guys die.  On the acting part, I thought Cruise actually did a decent job.  Everyone else was just lame.  But, I have a question: What were all the spies doing with Ausie/British (I really couldn't tell WHICH accent they were) accents?  The CIA is American - their men in the field don't have those foreign accents.<br />All in all, a lame, boring, laugh-able, &quot;action&quot; movie.  I was incredibly disapointed in it, because it made a mockery of the first Mission: Impossible (which I absolutely love).  Obviously, the complaints of those people who weren't smart enough to follow the first movie carried way too far into Woo's mind and into the directing of this film.  They should have left the first one alone.  But there was one good aspect of the movie: as the credits ran, they played Metallica's &quot;I Disappear.&quot;  Great song.  Bad movie.  Good soundtrack.  Buy soundtrack.  Don't buy movie.
B00000JCB3|1.0|I bought this cd off the advice of my friend which wasnt very good advice.  This cd is a piece of commericial trash that should be thrown away.  The lyrics dont even make sense half the time and when they do its pointless and has no reason.  Im sick of hearing Fred Durst preach about how Napster is good and record companies are bad.  Its all publicity to make him seem like the good guy.  After all he is vp of Interscope.  I will give Fred and Limp credit for one thing though, they can market themselves.  They make all these insecure high school kids think that they have some kind of connection with them.  Even the founder of Napster doesnt really like them.  He even said &quot;When did Fred Durst become our spokesman, why cant we get some one cool like Weezer&quot;.  He is right, go buy Weezer.  Some real music for you.
0380730405|4.0|Although I was I was bored at the author's rather lavish detail of surrounding landscape, I have to admit that this book read very well.  I would recommend it to anyone who can handle being bored for a while until the book finally catches your attention, which it certainly will, half-way through the book.
0385484518|3.0|This book has entered mainstream culture thanks to the promotion of Oprah and word of mouth.  Although the book is a sweet and somewhat enjoyable of a read, I don't believe it necessarily deserves the accolades and recognition that it has received in the last year.  Tuesdays with Morrie is a story about a rekindled friendship between a professor dying of ALS and a student that needs guidance with his relationships.  Approximately 11 Tuesdays are spent with the dying professor and the book describes how the once vivacious man slowly withers away physically but grows stronger in spirit.  The student, Mitch Albom learns about the importance of relationships, loving each other, and loving oneself.<br />It is not the best-written book but the beliefs that permeate throughout the novel are important.  Morrie was a man that was very much in touch with the philosophies that the great Zionist, Martin Buber discusses in his book, \\"I and Thou.\\"  Tuesdays with Morrie is a good book, but not a great one, and has benefited by the Oprah-effect no doubt.  For a simple cliff note version of Martin Buber's philosophies read this book - if you want to read about the importance and beauty of relationships and love, pick up \\"I and Thou.\\"  Tuesdays with Morrie is a sweet book that reminds of many of the inspirational books that people put next to the lavatory while sitting on their behind.  If you need some reading material for the commode, I recommend this novel - otherwise borrow the book from someone and see for yourself.  Morrie is definitely an inspiration, but the book was slightly disappointing.
0446310786|5.0|Everyone who can appreciate a wonderful book, that is.  Masterfully done, sweetly written, with a flowing style that seems to read itself.  Almost perfect!!
B000001GQR|5.0|When I first started seriously collecting classical music, I tended to avoid buying mono recordings.  While I fell in love with golden age stereo performances, mono ones from a few years earlier just didn't sound as good.  I tried to listen to historically significant discs, like the Casals Bach Cello Suites, Rachmaninoff Piano Concertos with the composer on piano, and the Furtwangler Beethoven 9th.  But no matter how celebrated these performances were and how great the playing was, I just couldn't get passed the overall poor sound quality of the mono recordings.  However, there are always exceptions to every rule, and this CD was definitely one of them.<br /><br />This recording of the Schubert Symphony No. 9 coupled with the Haydn Symphony No. 88, by the Berlin Philharmonic under the baton of legendary conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler, is a mono recording from 1951-52.  But this disc, part of the DG Originals Series has terrific sound, and my only complaint is it ever so slightly lacks the overall brightness and separation that stereo provides.  In terms of an empathetic, passionate rendition, this is unparalleled.  The Szell and Krips versions in early stereo of Schubert's Ninth may be equal to Furtwangler's, but they certainly don't surpass it.  But the added treat here is the Haydn 88.  I love the Paris and London Symphonies, so I was very excited about the inclusion of the 88th.  There are surprisingly few recordings currently available on CD of Symphonies 88-91, unless you buy one of those major Haydn box sets.  In all, this is a wonderful pair of symphonies, recorded excellently (despite being in mono), and performed impeccably.
B000002KIK|4.0|Perhaps some loyal BS fans thought the band &quot;sold out&quot; on Never Say Die, because it is not all-out heavy metal from beginning to end.  IMO, this is not a commercial &quot;sell-out&quot;, for the music is too good.  There is more variation to the color and texture of the music than I recall from early BS (though I was never a big Sabbath fan).  While the album is heavy in typical Sabbath style, it has relief moments and touches of acoustic guitar, piano and other keyboards too add to (not weaken) the sound.  My only complaint about the horns is that they weren't used enough!  Brass instruments are powerful.  When used well, as in &quot;Breakout&quot;, they add a rich, fat layer of sound to rock music.  And a comment on the background vocals (Butler's?):  While it's not a &quot;good&quot; voice, it blends well with Ozzy's voice to create an eerie sort of nasal harmony.  It works with this music!  <br />Give Sabbath a break, they had to experiment with their sound and let it evolve.  So what that it doesn't all sound like denim and leather?   The result is of good quality.
B000002MP2|5.0|The mid-90's gave us some truly phenomenal music, and Dookie can be said to be the pinnacle of this period.  It is one of those rare albums where every song is worth listening to and has its own genius behind it.  The album's tone is set right at the beginning with Burnout, and you immediately know you are in for a multi-song blitz, with each track full of strong emotion.  <br />Some of the well-known hits from the album are:  Longview, When I Come Around, Basketcse, She, and Welcome to Paradise.  In fact, with Basketcase, She, Sassaras Roots, and When I Come Around being tracks 7-10, you have what is surely one of the top back-to-back-to-back-to-back combinations in album history.  <br />Dookie is one of the select few albums which can be said to define an era.  Anyone who listens to music more than once a year is strongly urged to buy this album now.
076790382X|2.0|I enjoyed &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot; on tape, so I bought the tape of &quot;I'm a Stranger Here Myself&quot;. While there's some amusing anecdotes and insights, this book is something best taken in very, very small doses. Especially on tape, Mr. Bryson is a world-class whiner. He complains, kvetches, and moans about every small annoyance that confronts people in everyday life. If life is really this bad for him, I'm surprised he ever leaves the house.
0800177177|5.0|When this was released in the early 1990s, both the critics and the<br />public were not favorably impressed.  They were mistaken.  This is a<br />gorgeous, wonderful film that only a hardened romantic cynic could<br />fail to like.  Gary Oldman is an extraordinary talent in any film and<br />this was his finest moment. He brings a complexity to Dracula that no<br />one else has ever managed to achieve. Coppola created the most<br />artistic version of the Bram Stoker novel as well.  He hired many<br />artists to create gorgeous sets and backdrops.  The Japanese costume<br />designer won the Oscar for her creations.  Best of all, were the<br />puppets Coppola used to achieve special effects in several key scenes.<br />I've read the Rice vampire books and this is better.  I've read the<br />original Bram Stoker novel and this is better.  A decade earlier I<br />thought Klaus Kinski made the best vampire I'd ever seen in Hertzog's<br />\\"Nosferatu\\" but Gary Oldman even surpassed that performance.<br />It's been very sad for me to see Oldman typecast in more recent years<br />as a movie villain.  He makes a fantastic leading man and is being<br />wasted in these other films.  Ironically, some feel that the reason<br />for this is that he isn't good looking enough to play leading men.<br />Yet in Fall 2000 he lights up the advertising world doing the sexiest<br />clothing ads imaginable for Donna Karan.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00000DGUM|5.0|This is an excelent album. It shows how skid row can range from an almost melodic group of musicians all the way through to some hard rock almost heavy metal tracks showing some real power! Buy this if you like any skid row, guns n roses, Aerosmith or any good music! It rocks!!
0380730405|5.0|There are very few novels that are followed by equally splendid movie versions. \\"Rebecca\\" is one of those few.  Written in the first person, \\"I\\" (she is never given another name) marries wealthy widower Max De Winter.  When she accompanies him to his estate, Manderly, she comes to suspect that he and everyone who surrounds him is still besotted with his beautiful, dead wife, Rebecca. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, almost drives her crazy with always comparing her to that eternal paragon of beauty and delight. The novel seems to be set in the 1920s or 1930s in England.  It was released as a movie in 1940 by Alfred Hitchcock and won many Oscars.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier played Max and Joan Fontaine played \\"I\\".  Both the novel and the movie present marvelous elements of romance and mystery in a time period that is not used frequently enough for fiction. There is one difference between the novel and the film.  Because of the rigid code of censorship existing then in Hollywood, Max is not as morally ambiguous in the film as he ultimately is in the novel.  It makes no difference to me because I love both versions equally. I am not surprised that both have proven to be enduring classics. If you are feeling burned out by too many modern bad novels and even worse movies, try these two classics which have easily withstood the test of time.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B000002J1B|5.0|This album is a spell-binding masterpiece that only meets any sliver of doubt at the end.  &quot;To be over&quot; is really the obly part of the album that to me has a a bit of weakness.  But even at that its excellent.  &quot;The gates of delirium&quot; is probably one of the most amazing pieces of modern music ever made.  &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; From beginning to end is almost chaotic and beautifull at the same time.  I cant really put this album into words well enough to do it justice. All I can say is that there's no room for the faint at heart, or the close minded.  Buy it.
B000002W5J|4.0|Although they had released a highly competent folk-rock debut before it (&quot;Takes Off&quot;), &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; sounds like the true arrival of The Jefferson Airplane, thanks largely to the addition of Grace Slick and the increasing dexterity of guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and bassist Jack Casady.  The San Francisco sound comes alive on &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; and &quot;White Rabbit&quot;, two explosive acid rock anthems which came to define the era.  Slick's knife-edge vocals are hard to ignore, and her lyric on &quot;White Rabbit&quot; is as  clever and ominous as it was thirty-four years ago; even after all the drug-related burnouts and deaths, the song avoids sounding dated because it does not celebrate drug use so  much as express a generation's frustration at their parents' hypocrisy.  Coupled with the essential human truth expounded  on so urgently in &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;, it awakened millions to the possibility that something new and better could arise. The other rockers, &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; and &quot;3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds&quot;, also feature bohemian/hippie lyrics coupled with stuttering rhythms, bouncy guitar leads and ping-pong vocal harmonies.  However, the album is also known for its quieter, romantic side, where Marty Balin takes center stage for tracks like &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Comin' Back To Me&quot;, meditative prayers on  love that find him reaching an early peak of expression and yearning; listen closely with eyes shut and you'll understand.  Kaukonen contributes to the mood with his gentle, cathartic solo acoustic guitar showpiece &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot;.  The final track, &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;, is a hilarious, cynical love song to a car which was later funkified in concert (see &quot;Bless Its Pointed Little Head&quot;).  Indeed, most of these songs became standards in the Airplane's concert setlist; the exceptions were &quot;DCBA-25&quot;, which harkened back to the folk-rock of the  first album, and &quot;How Do You Feel&quot;, which sounded a little like The Mamas And The Papas' mild folk-pop.  These lesser moments aside, another reason why this otherwise-seminal album only gets four stars is the quality of the CD, which has to be one of the worst ever; released in the 80s, it sounds metallic and boomy, and made a good case for the format's lack of warmth back then.  It is in desperate need of remixing or remastering, which has been done with all the other Airplane albums but curiously enough, not the one which defined their sound (an expensive gold CD exists combining the mono and stereo versions and is supposed to sound better).  It is somewhat fitting, and perhaps not surprising, that technology has not been kind to an album which was so fiercely cynical toward technology.  This was the Jefferson Airplane, and San Francisco, in 1966 (the year of its writing and recording, although it was released in 1967 and came to symbolize that year as well): the thrill of discovery, the gentle hope and optimism, the cynical look at the straight world--it's all here, and it's waiting for you.
B00000K31V|1.0|ATLOB (I won't tell you what that stands for). This movie is similar to the Matrix which I found totally boring as well. Give me a night at the movies with Sigourney and the Aliens anyday.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I'm a pretty big fan of punk music, but I'm a really big fan of the Offspring. I orginally borrowed this CD from a friend. I knew some of the Offspring's songs such as Pretty Fly (for a white guy) and Why don't you get a Job?. After listening to this CD, I realized how much those songs suck compared to the rest of this CD. My friend eventually gave me this CD and I listen to it all the time. Some of the best songs on here are Have You Ever?, Staring at the Sun, Kid's aren't alright, and Walla Walla. My favorite songs are She's Got Issues and Pay the Man. Check out Smash and Ixnay on the Hombre too. Buy this now!
B00004U2NX|5.0|This is truly the most spellbinding vampire movie I have ever seen.  Kinski is terrific as the vampire and the movie is genuinely scary.  From the creepy musical score to the dying plague victims this movie is a must have for any horror fan or for that matter anyone who likes a great movie.  The movie stays fairly true to it's roots and rates right up there with its predecessor.  The movie is like a nightmare come true with a dreamy kind of horror to it.  I can honestly say that this is a highlight in my colloection and doubt that it will be matched!!
0425129586|5.0|This book, written by Agatha Christie is so far the best book that I have ever read.  I loved how she blended the great mystery with the excitement of the and terror of the characters.  The plot was easy to understand and was very well written.  All of the characters were unique.  They all had some thing different about them.  Whether it was the way they acted or how proper they were.  Another thing that I loved about this book is how Christie sort of hinted who was going to get killed and somehow  a different person was killed.  In some way they always followed the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; poem.  The best part was trying figure out was killing the &quot;visitors.&quot;
6300214826|1.0|First off this movie is a struggle to watch.  The dialouge is inane and the movie has enough filler for a 90 min. sequel.  The movie starts well and gets the viewer interested and then brings your hopes to rock bottom.  I found this to be an insult of viewing time so if you want a good war movie with good appeal, see Platoon or Full Metal Jacket and leave this where you saw it.
B000001Y5J|5.0|this is a great album. though many people say it's different from all the other nin's albums, i think it's still very nine inch nails. nin fans know that even when an album is different from the last one, there's always the &quot;mark&quot; of the band. it's tougher, but it's the same person writing the songs and performing them with his band.<br />i don't say i recommend it, because if you really like nin (like i do), any cd of them you buy, you'll love.
B00000IMCU|5.0|This was a terrific way to follow its predecessor and this one keeps you sweating and begging for more straight up to the end.  Beautiful gory effects highlight this perfect zombie flick.  Again a classic from George Romero.  Thanks you George!
0790729350|4.0|For a person not born in the sixties this provides a glimpse of the social unease experinced by many young people around the late 60's. This unease is found among the the anti-vietnam &amp; anti-govrnmant slant among the songs. Besides the political and social upheavel going on at that time the spirit of all musicians was very much &quot;We are all here to make good music and have a good time&quot;. Everybody including this viewer had a good time watching this DVD.
B00004X01U|2.0|Well, This definitely is not Madonna best work.  I really expected a notch above Ray of Light (one of the best albums of all time, by anyone).  This album definitely was not that.  I felt it to be repetitive trip-hop loops amongt souless songs.  It feels like she just threw a dance-techno album together without much consideration for track listings or music thought.  I expected Ray of Light and got the Gambler.
0709058764|5.0|This is not a type of beautifully decorated book usually found on coffee table to amuse guests even though it is of superb quality. It belongs in the workshop.  It is written for both inspired and motivated beginners as well as serious luthiers.  The chapter on tuning plates is revealing but can confuse a beginner. Since I am a beginner myself, I wished for complete measurements of the violin.  I overcame the shortcomings by contacting a supplier of woods, tools and plans.  Rest assured, the author included the list of suppliers at the end of the book.
B00003CXDG|4.0|...I thought this movie was very entertaining and that's why Igo to watch movies.  If people went to &quot;action movies&quot; thatonly were based on the truth and what could only happen in real lifethey would be boring.  I really enjoyed some of the fightchoreagraphing in this movie.  Being a Mission:Impossible movie therewere a lot of good special effects.  That is what John Woo brings tohis movies and hopefully he will direct many more action films in thestates.

B000006XSD|3.0|After the combined high of WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE and ALICE COOPER GOES TO HELL, this album comes as a disappointment.  It has its moments.  &quot;Lace and Whiskey,&quot; and &quot;Road Rats&quot; are rocking numbers with catchy hooks that linger in the memory.  &quot;You and Me,&quot; and &quot;I Never Wrote That Song&quot; are both sweet and tender without being nauseating.  &quot;My God&quot; is a decent song that unfortunately doesn't catch fire.  The humorous &quot;King of the Silver Screen&quot; doesn't have the same satirical bite of Alice Cooper's earlier(and better) works.  It sort of falls flat.  The worst songs are &quot;Damned If You Do, &quot;Ubangi Stomp,&quot; and the particularly hideous &quot;(No More) Love at Your Convenience,&quot; a disco song that should be thrown out with the trash.  All-in-all, this is a fun and enjoyable disc.  It just won't make anyone forget such classic albums as KILLER, LOVE IT TO DEATH, or SCHOOL'S OUT.
6303327982|4.0|Almost 25 years before this movie was made, a movie was released that touches on almost all of the subjects explored in 'Natural Born Killers'.  That movie was 'Clockwork Orange'.  Few would doubt that Stanley Kubrick was a better director than Oliver Stone, but what makes this movie fascinating is how the ideas in 'Clockwork Orange' are presented on a 90s backdrop.  The 60s was a chaotic, revolutionary era and the 90s is the age when all the children of that scary yet beautiful age are growing up.  These people have watched their country turn almost 180 in just a few short decades.  If the 60s was the flower power generation, then the 90s is the trailer park generation and Mickey and Mallory were a product of it.  Both 'Clockwork Orange' and 'Natural Born Killers' touched on the subject of murder in the eyes of desensitized people.  What made the Oliver Stone version of this topic interesting was the relationship between Mickey and Mallory.  It was odd to see two sick, twisted individuals actually care about another person but what was downright *scary* was that, when you thought about it, their relationship was no different than your average 90s couple.  This may not be a groundbreaking film and it may be pretentious in parts, but it is definitely a break from the average Hollywood fare because it actually makes you think about the world in which you live.  Pick this and 'A Clockwork Orange' up ASAP.
B000001ZS5|3.0|I'm a proud owner of all of Jarre's productions to date. I listen to his music on a daily basis and enjoy it all over again. The only member of the 18 CD set that isn't being played on a daily basis is this CD... I find it dull and lacking in the sense of the usual Jarre melodic gardens. You can hear it's Jarre behind the notes, but a somewhat regular and a much less innovative that what I've come to expect of such great musician.
0875847706|5.0|'. . . The objective of this book is to provide . . . the means to lift off from . . . struggle and sail into a vast universe of possibility.'<br />Benjamin Zander is the conductor of The Boston Philharmonic and is well known for his orchestra's passionate performances.  Rosamund Stone Zander is an executive coach, family therapist, and private practitioner who brings enormous psychological perspective to enhancing human behavior.  They have written a fascinating book in which they alternate as voices in sharing principles and examples in the form of compelling stories.<br />They have striven to make what they share ' . . . simple, not easy.'  The idea is to help you create in yourself and in others 'transformational' improvements.<br />They share a series of perspectives designed to improve your understanding of what and where the potential is.<br />First, humans tend to focus on very few things, missing most of what is going on around them.  By shifting focus, you will see many opportunities for the first time.  Much of this book is designed to do that for you.  You will visit our old friend the nine dot square and be reminded that connecting all of the dots in four lines without lifting your writing instrument from the paper requires you to go outside the box that we mentally draw at the circumference of the dots.  Be careful about your assumptions!  They can fence you in!<br />Second, measurements can cause us to focus too narrowly on where we are today and encourage scarcity thinking -- the glass is half empty.  The Zanders encourage thinking about the glass as half full, citing the well-known perspective of optimism as being empowering.  This can help you 'step into a university of possibility.'  I like to call this pursuing the ideal practice.<br />Third, if you assume that people will do well and help them see how they can, they will.  Mr. Zander gives every student an A in his class, and simply requests that the student write a paper to tell what they will do to deserve the A.  This gets the students focused on excellence, and takes away the tension that harms accomplishment.<br />Fourth, as a mindset, think of your role as 'being a contributor.'  'You are a gift to others.'  How could that change what you do?  As someone who thinks that way now, I find it a very useful perspective, and was glad to see it in the book.<br />Fifth, lead from any chair.  This is a reference to involving everyone.  Mr. Zander asks his players to write down how he could improve practices and peformances, and pays attention to the suggestions.<br />Sixth, follow rule number six.  That rule is to 'lighten up.'<br />Seventh, be present to the ways things are.  Many of us are disconnected from reality.  By re-touching it, we can see more possiblities.<br />Eighth, give way to passion.  Going with your strong feelings allows you to be more authentic, and to go to new heights of accomplishment.<br />Ninth, light a spark.  See you role as creating a spark of possibility to be lit that others can see.<br />Tenth, be the board of the game you are playing.  This makes it easier to see how you can make a difference.<br />Eleventh, create a vision that generates 'frameworks of possibility' for others.  Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous 'I Have a Dream' speech is cited.<br />Twelfth, tell the WE story.  Focus on being inclusive and considering what is best for all.  Move from I to We, as the Coda to the book encourages.<br />Each section has exercises you can use to deepen your understanding of the principles and to help you practice, in order to create greater skill.<br />The principles are similar to those in many other books about improving performance and creativity.  What is different about the book are the unique ways that the principles are expressed, the exciting examples in beautiful stories from music and business that will be new to you (as they were to me), and the passion with which the Zanders write.  I would love to hear them do this bookon an audio cassette!  Both do public speaking, so you may get a chance to hear them.<br />Can we ever get too many great inspirational stories and reminders to live up to our potential rather than our pasts?  I don't think so.  This book will reignite your passion for making a larger and more positive difference.  It will make you more human as you do so.<br />After you have finished the book, consider where your passion, gifts, and influence can combine to all you to most effectively live these principles.  Consider that as a calling for at least some of your leisure time.  If you are lucky, you can find some way to make that a primary calling for your working hours, as well.  But find that place, and spend as much time as you can there!book on an audio cassette!

B000001ZSE|5.0|I thought this compilation is magnificent. But I also heard of different versions as to this CD's concern. There are several tracks that were remixed and were added the digital synth features of today's music, as opposed to their minimalistic features of the analog synths of the 70's. It worked quite well is some cases, but in others it sounded like just another Radio commercial jingle.<br />The three new tracks that were added are probably why this CD is worth the price tag. They're wonderful. They're like nothing you'd expect from Jarre. Innovative, melodic, rich in sound and variety... simply wonderful.<br />To sum up... Jarre's most popular does most certainly not mean that it's his best, it's a risk. But such a risk is very easy to take. Take it.
0679805273|5.0|Researchers constantly find that reading to children is valuable in a variety of ways, not least of which are instilling a love of reading and improved reading skills. With better parent-child bonding from reading, your child will also be more emotionally secure and able to relate better to others. Intellectual performance will expand as well. Spending time together watching television fails as a substitute.<br />To help other parents apply this advice, as a parent of four I consulted an expert, our youngest child, and asked her to share with me her favorite books that were read to her as a young child. Oh, the Places You'll Go! was one of her picks.<br />This book describes a future filled with unlimited potential ('you can steer any direction you choose'), success ('you'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the lead'), set-backs ('you can get all hung up on a prickle-ly perch'), and overcoming obstacles ('somehow you'll escape all that waiting and staying').<br />Many will mischaracterize this book.  Since it starts with the words, 'Congratulations! Today is your day.', some will see it only in the context of some special event.  At one level, it could certainly be a graduation present for a high school or college grad.  At another level, it can be given to those who are moving on from one school to another.  You can also see it as a gift for any transition, even if from one grade to the next.<br />But, I think that the more important application of this book is in setting a standard of parental beliefs for your child about one's child's future life.  Psychologists in book after book tell us that parents tend not to be supportive enough, and that teenagers and adult children feel that they have never lived up to their parents' standards.  This book can play a very important role in conveying what those standards are and making them match up nicely with what will probably occur in your child's life.  That's a tremendous resource, and one that all of us should avail outselves of!  In particular, the end says, 'And will you succeed?  Yes!  You will, indeed! (98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.).  Notice, that the guarantee comes after faithfully pointing out that the path to success is never straight, that there will be setbacks, and that there will be self-doubt and delays.  Hearing that guarantee in the context of the likely difficulties makes one realize that optimism and perserverance are what is being encouraged here.  Also, setbacks and delays are merely that ... not failure or failing to meet parental standards.<br />Psychologists tell us that those who believe they can succeed will put up twice the effort of those who doubt their success.<br />So after thinking about it, I propose that the day to give this book to someone who has never seen it before is on the darkest day of their life, when all seems bleak and impossible.  It may make all of the difference.  The gift will be all the more meaningful if you (or someone else) read this book to them when they were younger.<br />With your children, the right time to introduce this book is as young as possible, so that the belief in their success and the realistic challenges of success will be grounded as soon and as deeply as possible.<br />So you may give this book as a gift to the same child many times in a lifetime.  But don't leave out those who need it who are not your children!  They need it even more if their parents did not read Oh, the Places You'll Go! to them as a child!<br />After you have read this book to your child or given it as a gift to someone else, consider the other ways that you can appropriately boost the self-confidence of that person.

B000001ZS3|5.0|Very simplistic, very clean and melodic. Jarre at his usual best. If you're into the analog synth type of music, this is probably the best CD money can buy. If you like the richer sound, digital synth and modern samples, I can't guarentee you'll enjoy it as much, but you'll enjoy it nevertheless. I will, however, recommend it to everyone... this is Jarre, the art at its finest. A musical magic which is magical music.
076790382X|4.0|The title pretty well spares me the need to describe the book except that it is in the format of reprints of previously published columns for a British audience.  What is nice here is that we see not only how we look, but what about us would 'jump out' at a foreign people.<br />I think you either like Bryson's brand of humour or you don't.  Myself, I think he's hysterical; he's a lot like Dave Barry, so if you like one you'll probably like the other.  He's a little less silly in his approach than Barry; the humour doesn't mask his actual emotions about what he encounters.  I find him to be a keen observer of his own native land, but since by and large his criticisms are similar to mine, I guess that's no big shocker.<br />Marked down only because all the material is previously published, and because there's one flaw here and it's one to which we Westerners are quite sensitive:  except for allusions to his Iowa childhood and some travel around the country, by and large he's talking about the Northeast.  The unspoken assumption is that he's in the only part of the country that really matters or has any character and that the rest of us live in big, boring, empty, non-cozy, everything-was-built-yesterday states.  As for me, I think all parts of the nation have value.  His 'Notes on Returning to America' are really 'Notes about moving from Britain to New Hampshire'.<br />A very good book nonetheless, and on the bright side, a good look at New Hampshire for those of us who haven't been there.
B00003CWTH|4.0|During the first thirty minutes of Magnolia, you wonder &quot;Will this thing ever slow down?&quot;  The movie speeds ahead at freight train pace, and a lack of attention will leave you behind, but the speed is nothing short of exhilirating.  At other points in the movie, you'll ask &quot;Is there a point to all this?&quot;  That question is answered in a few of the storylines, but not all.  <br />The superb ensemble cast, including Julianne Moore, Melora Waters, Tom Cruise, and Jason Robards among others, makes this movie, along with Anderson's interesting direction.  Each storyline, none of which are &quot;sub&quot;plots, zoom ahead down their individual paths.  Julianne Moore's character comes closer and closer to the brink, Tom Cruise's sex-guru is slowly taken apart by a journalist and his own past, and John C. Reilly's cop character tries to find love while a move of dramatic irony shows that the woman of his dreams (Melora Waters) should be someone he needs to arrest.  Jeremy Blackman, a newcomer playing Stanley the quiz-kid, gives a great performance as a character you can't help but sympathize with.<br />All these conflicts and intersections are finally brought together with an act of Biblical proportions that truly displays the uniqueness and innovation of P.T. Anderson and his directing. And in the words of Stanley, &quot;This is something that happens.&quot;  While not all of the characters find happy endings, Anderson makes a genuine effort to try to make sure they all find something they've wanted (whether consciously or subconsciously) at least.<br />With movies such as &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;Titanic&quot;  equalling the length of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; Anderson's vision is still not quite as mainstream as these other blockbusters and therefore didn't shatter the glass ceiling of ticket sales, but I bet Anderson really didn't care if he made millions from his film.  After &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and its success (which starred a few of the same actors as &quot;Magnolia&quot;), Anderson was finally able to explore more of his directing skills (whether they hit their mark or fell flat) and this was the satisfaction of Magnolia.  Although, I admit, I laughed so hard seeing Anderson's jaw drop, being comforted by girlfriend and fellow enfant terrible Fiona Apple, at the Oscars when he didn't win Best Director.  However, congratulations to Tom Cruise for his nomination and to Anderson for pulling this amazing performance out of him.  I expect a lot more from Anderson in the future, and he just might deliver.
078062999X|4.0|I enjoyed this adaption of &quot;Hamlet&quot; mostly because Kenneth Branagh didn't change the dialogue--when watching the movie at home, I followed along with my worn copy of the play. The set is gorgeous, the acting--for the most part--is very good, Julie Christie, Derek Jacobi and Richard Briers standing out. I don't know about Branagh; at times he was wonderful and utterly convincing, but at other times I couldn't get past that awful color he has in his hair. And poor Jack Lemmon! I love the man, but come on. He had no rhythm or feeling for the lines whatsoever. Altogether, though, a very good adaption of the play.
0316921173|4.0|The key is in the title.  Infinite Jest.<br />The essence of the book is one of entertainment.  Very few can really claim to have never been highly amused at any point during this book.  A key vehicle in the book is a movie so entertaining it reduces viewers to drooling zombies, desiring only to waste away watching it.<br />DFW wrote, in ASFTINDA (abbv.), about how American entertainment these days is really only voyeurism.  And that's what you have in this book.  You're able to watch, up close, the lives of a handful of people.  You read it because you want to know what happens.<br />And DFW, eventually, after 1100 pages, denies you this.  You read, waiting for closure, looking on, hoping for some climax.  A point of summarily ultimate entertainment.  But he cuts you off.<br />That, I believe, is the Joke.  This book is a social commentary, but the subjects of that commentary aren't found in the book.  It's the readers.  80% of the people that have reviewed this gave it either 5 stars or none (maybe one).  We are the subjects.  Wallace has shown, or rather proved, brilliantly that our entertainment comes from voyeurism.  Those who liked the book say they enjoyed the small tidbits of humor, usually embedded within the every-day lives of the characters.  Those who hated the book justify their stance most commonly by emphasising the lack of a proper ending.  Either way, you liked or hated the book based on the amount of voyeurism you were allowed.<br />Either way, whether you like it (because of what you were able to see) or hate it (because of what you were denied watching), the joke is on us.  We played the part of social lab rats.  That's the infinite jest.
6305531374|3.0|Anyone planning on seeing or buying this movie should know that it does not really make sense when viewing Parts 4, 5, and 6.  Jamie Lee Curtis, who is terrific in this one by the way, has said in numerous interviews to forget those films and watch Parts 1, 2, and H20 as the definitive trilogy.  That being said, the best parts of H20 are when our lead actress is on the screen.  Whether it be from having nightmares, being a teacher, having lunch with Adam Arkin, or duking it out with her brother, Michael Myers, Curtis is great to watch.  The bad parts of the film involve the lead young actors, including Josh Hartnett (The Faculty), who plays the son of Laurie Strode (Curtis), and his cheesy girlfriend, played by Michelle Williams of TV's Dawson's Creek fame (is this H20 or Dawson's Bloody Creek?).  Both are horrible.  I enjoyed the two other costarring friends of theirs much better.  At least they had some wit and humor about them that was fun.  LL Cool J is enjoyable standing around through the whole movie as a security guard, convincing his wife that he wants to be a romance novelist by reading excerpts to her over the phone when he should be working.  But the film focuses too much on the son and the girlfriend.  Maybe that wouldn't be so bad if the people playing the parts could actually act.  You might think I'm being a bit harsh but I couldn't find any redeeming qualities between the two of them.  The only scene where he even helps his Mom is at the beginning after she's had her nightmare (He gives her medication and calms her down).  But are we to believe that he doesn't really love his Mom?  That he just feels obligated?  That he's resentful of her acting nuts over a supposed killer he's never seen?  That she's just a head case he can't wait to get away from rather than support?  I know horror fans might not care, but this film could've been 100 times better if this relationship was better developed.  If I had a choice I'd have picked Tobey Maguire (Pleasantville, The Cider House Rules) as the son and Natalie Portman (The Professional, Heat) as the girlfriend.  See, they can actually act.  They could pull it off.  But I guess a Part 7 horror movie doesn't exactly attract alot of good young actors.  John Carpenter (Halloween 1) even turned down the opportunity to direct the film after Jamie Lee Curtis offered him the chance.  And as for Big Mike?  To me, Nick Castle will always be the real Michael Myers.  It's just the way he moves and his subtle gestures that define him to the role, while the others (mostly stunt people) ended up only trying to imitate him, but nowhere near having the same effect.  So watch the movie mainly for Jamie Lee Curtis's performance.  She's the best thing about this movie.  But if you're planning on buying this film on DVD, I feel you're getting gypped because it is very expensive and only has a trivia game, music video and a short &quot;making of&quot; featurette on it (not even a trailer).  The copy I own says on the back that an audio commentary by Director Steve Miner and Jamie Lee Curtis was offered but it's actually not even on the disc.  To Dimension Films, I just want to say this is false advertisement.  As for their being a Halloween 8?  Only time will tell.
0671034065|5.0|I picked this book up on Friday afternoon and didn't put it down until I finished it at 1:30 Saturday morning.  This story is a good mystery.  Ms. Howard had me hooked from the start.  The dialogue between her characters is wonderful.  The women in the story could easily have been myself and my friends.  Now the hero isn't your everyday guy.  Sam is great.  The dislike that becomes love between Sam and Jaine is very entertaining and believable.  Ms. Howard's writing, in my opinion, has improved greatly over the years.  I no longer see her as a 'romance' novelist but as a mystery, suspense author with a little romance thrown in to round out the story.

B00000IL1K|5.0|Yesterday as I walked through a store I heard this incredible music pouring through the speakers. My day had been hectic and a bit tiring... before I heard this music all I wanted to do was hurry up and get out of the store and go home. But the music grabbed my attention and made me stop and listen... after the first few tracks I knew I had to have the CD. This kind of music has never appealed to me, operatic instrumentation while powerful and sometimes beautiful often seems so very intense. But this is incredible, breathtaking... I spent the entire evening playing the CD over and over again... some tracks bringing a smile... others touching my heart in unexpected ways... after reading some of the other reviews I see there are Brightman purists who are taken aback and somewhat disappointed that their star has crossed over to appeal to the mainstream... Why not look at it as a way to have more friends to share this fantastic voice with... why is it so hard for much of the public to accept that artists perform to be seen or heard... whatever the case may be... Enjoy what they offer don't fault them for doing what comes natural to them...

B00000612G|5.0|I didn't think i would find an album better than Stranger in this town, I was wrong.  This Album is my all time favourite.  It shows great songwriting skills, maybe Richie's greatest gift.  His voice is great we all know that.  His guitar playing is passionate and incredible, but with only one real rock song on this album what i noticed was the songwriting.  This is a very mature album, it is an album which makes you think about your life and ultimatly makes you feel good about it.  or at least makes you do something positive about it.  This album is the soundtrack to my life.<br />What more can i say.....

B000001G16|5.0|The first thing you notice about this album is the setting.  It makes you feel like you are in another world.  The vocals are very passionate and powerful and prove that Sambora would have a very good career as a solo artist, probably gaining more credibility.  As you would expect the guitar playing is incredible, moody and gentle in some places and screaming at others - the perfect blend.<br />The songs themself are timeless and classic.  The album is now almost 10 years old and still sounds as good as it did then.<br />As noted above a definate five star album.
0140282033|4.0|I didn't even know this author existed until I happened to see my favorite word on a bookshelf. I could not resist (I never even try when it comes to chocolate), so I bought the book, and for once I was glad to let my sweet tooth do my thinking. The story begins when a gentle, easygoing wanderer, Vianne, settles in a small French village and opens a chocolate boutique, drawing the attention of everyone, specially of a straitlaced, self-righteous priest named Reynaud (one word of advice to staunch Catholics: pick something else). Tension mounts on each side, or more like, in Reynaud's side, since Vianne pretty much ignores him. I love the underlying idea in the story that chocolate is connected with temptation, sin, and all bad things worth doing. And the ending was so good, I just laughed my heart out. The only thing I couldn't quite accept is the depiction of the villagers; the story would have been more believable if it had been located in a small New England town; the Puritanism of some of the characters just doesn't coincide with my idea of French thinking, but since I haven't lived in France I can't say more on the subject. Heavy readers, look for something else; this is light reading, only perfect for someone looking forward to have a good time and not to analyze.
0790720434|5.0|It started innocently enough.  I just attempted to walk through the room where my kids were watching this movie.  But I never made it to the other side.  I happened in on the part where Mary is following the little bird through a maze of shrubbery.  The visual is stunning enough, but what really makes this version work is the soundtrack.  In this particular part, there is a very gusty, cold, damp wind blowing against the grey and dark green shrubbery, and in the background, behind the swishing of the leaves and the twittering of this little bird comes a piano and French horn duet that absolutely fascinated me with it's solemn, haunting mellowness.  <br />It's hard to describe how powerfully the soundtrack melds into the visuals in this version of the classic children's book.  Usually, the soundtrack provides an underpinning for the visuals and tries not to get in the way of the story or characters.  But in this rendition, the soundtrack provides at least fully half of the impact. Needless to say, I was stuck there for the rest of the movie and have watched it again numerous times - most often alone.<br />I've not seen the other (1987) version, but of the bad reviews that it gets I can tell you there is none of that here aside from the normal English snobbery.  My only hesitation is that the movie dabbled ever, EVER, so slightly on the occult (not enough to be offensive to most religious people), until going off the deep end briefly..., BRIEFLY..., in a short, but blatant seance with strong Celtic/Wiccan leanings.  It was very brief, and it goes way past the understanding of young kids who may be watching.  I could fairly easily edit it out, but unfortunately, the seance is a key turning point that makes the rest of the plot make sense.<br />In writing this review, I may be guilty of reminiscing.  Perhaps the stunning visuals, scenery, and mood are only appealing to me because I was born and raised for most of my childhood in England, in settings very much like this.But the soundtrack is universal.  Buy this movie, and then go buy it's soundtrack CD.  I recommend this movie primarily for adults - not due to the content, but because the story is dark and moody, and children will most likely be bored by it.<br />If you are prone to tears, keep a box of tissues nearby.  The ending is so emotionally powerful that it will absolutely push you over the edge.  I'm a fully grown, 36 year old man, and I couldn't speak to my wife for half an hour after the movie ended.<br />If you like this, our other favourites include &quot;Shadowlands&quot; (based on a true story and also a major tragic tear-jerker) and &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;.
B000002MUW|5.0|Fusioned by a combination of classic balladry, soul, and alternative/techno music, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is one of Madonna's best albums to date. As the years progressed, Madonna became much more mature in her musical styles, and after all the hoopla from the controversy her &quot;Sex&quot; book caused, she decided to take a much more modest approach with this album. While I'm not saying that her &quot;Erotica&quot; album was bad, because in reality it was one of her best, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; allowed Madonna to venture into new musical territory and producers.<br />Produced by musical powerhouse producer Babyface, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; opens up with &quot;Survival,&quot; which has Madonna recounting that while she wasn't totally a saint on her way to the top, her success was a survival story. She's right (critics penned her as a one-hit wonder and predicted Cyndi Lauper as the next big thing during the 1980's) and this song is a great opener for a great album.<br />&quot;Secret&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; have their share of funk, and provide the listener with enough dance/club music to keep their interest in this album satisfied. However most of the album reflects Madonna's journey into the world of ballads and soft-pop that has garnered her many new fans lately. <br />&quot;Take a Bow&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; captured Madonna's magic in using her vocals in producing an effective approach when singing slow, love songs. &quot;Inside of Me&quot; is a sensual, slow, and soft song that speaks of Madonna's longing for love (not necessarily sexual, but the song does emit that to the listener) inside of her. <br />However, my two favorite songs on this album have to be &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story.&quot; On the former, we get to hear Madonna's vocals amidst a blend of string instruments and a Spanish-style guitar, talking about rejected love. The song is mesmerizing in every sense of the word, and thisBabyface produced track has to be the best ballad on this album.<br />&quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, which marks Madonna's first journey into the world of alternative music, was written by Bjork, the reigning queen of alternative rock, and produced by Nellee Hooper (of &quot;Soul II Soul&quot; fame). The sound of this song, its' effects, and even the companion music video (the second most-expensive music video in history, and a mind tripping work of art; it's available on her &quot;93:99&quot; video collection) blew me away then and now, and it is one of my favorite techno tracks ever.<br />If you haven't already purchased this album, please do so! Madonna is truly a pioneer in whatever she does, and this album happens to be one of her best in recent years.

B000001E18|5.0|genius is rarely planned; it just happens. zooropa, recorded in a mere four weeks while bono had hung up his fly shades, edge was wooing belly dancers, and adam was chasing supermodels, had low expectations from the start. originally conceived as an ep, somehow it managed to grow up into a full-blown album upon release. it is a diary for the state of mind for four irish boys that have spent too much time in front of the television- it oozes soundbites and jingles, slogans and televangelism, sex and sitcoms.<br />this album is to the &quot;magical mystery tour&quot; as &quot;achtung baby&quot; was to &quot;sargeant pepper&quot;, a mad slapdash view into the chaos of touring that leaves the psychosis just a little more than insane. the beatles may have parodied it but u2 managed to collect inspiration from actually touring via zoo tv, the best three ring circus of the nineties. in the process, &quot;zooropa&quot; comes off as the masterwork in which they had always been one stroke shy of attaining.<br />i think it is safe to say that no band has ever placed such a level of trust in their audience; &quot;zooropa&quot; is so far removed from the rest of the albums in u2's canon that it almost seems like a deliberate attempt to alienate the fans that supported them up to this point. if &quot;achtung baby&quot; was the sound of four men cutting down the joshua tree, then &quot;zooropa&quot; can be likened to four men lighting up a smoke, contemplating their actions, and wishing they had used a chainsaw.
B000007MVM|5.0|Undoubtedly a brilliant album, but very disturbing. Elements of Syd's pop genius still shine through in parts, notably \\"Octopus.\\" Still, is this so much a work of art or a voyeuristic examination of somebody's mental collapse? Whichever it is, this album is defenitely a one of a kind.    The shimmering production from \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\" is gone here, but then again so are the fairytale lyrics and cosmic explorations. The celestial kamikaze had certainly crashed and burned by this point. What Syd was left with was a shattered psyche and that's what he wrote about. The intensely personal lyrics can be overwhelming.     After the production/songwriting pefection on Floyd's first album, the loose and erratic arrangements on MADCAP are heartbreaking. Why? Because they are wholly representative of Syd's mental state. And for a human being to undergo the trauma that Syd did, is very unfortunate.    But back to the songs themselves. The opening track, \\"Terrapin,\\" is one of the prettiest love songs ever. And it's about a turtle in love with a fish, for Pete's sake. \\"Late Night\\" is spooky and eerie, the logical conclusion to Jugband Blues.\\" None of the songs, even the fragmentary ones, are out of place on this odd album.    Highly recommended.
0812567110|5.0|This book is sooo good, I think no jaded reader can deserve that title without having read this book. Dorian Gray, an astonishingly beautiful young aristocrat, receives the gift of eternal youth in the form of a painting one of his friends has made of him. Later, prompted by another friend, the divine dissolute Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian gradually falls into a dissipate lifestyle and the eerie painting shows both the ravages of age and the advance of Dorian's moral decay, while he retains his breathtaking looks. As Dorian becomes more and more obsessed with the painting's worsening appearance, the changes in his once sweet and naive personality are explained in the story, and Dorian lives in fear of the painting being exposed to the world, therefore showing him beyond any doubt as the sleazy creep he is, until it comes to a point when the gift  he prized so much ends up turning against him. Dorian Gray is one of the least likable characters I have seen on print, but I really liked his wicked friend Lord Wotton, who in the story is the one in charge of leading Dorian astray and dishing criticism after witty criticism of nineteenth century English society. I later learned this particular character was a sort of mockery of Oscar Wilde himself. A mellower version of this character can be found in another of Wilde's works, Lord Arthur Savile's Crime, my second favorite story by this author.
6300268470|5.0|This is my favorite western of all time and one of my favorite films all-around. Howard Hawks is never a better storyteller than he is here. The cast is phenominal. John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson all absolutely pitch perfect. This is one of those movies that you just never want to end. The film has everything, great characters, action, suspense, comedy, musical numbers......One to be cherished.

No solo la historia es conmovedora y llena de magia, si no que conlleva un gran mensaje. Quien no ha dicho alguna vez las palabras magicas de 'espejito... espejito...'. Mi padre relataba su aventura del dia en que fue a ver la pelicula el dia del estreno alla por los anos 30s, y de como recordaba la pelicula y casi la tenia memorizada aun a sus 65 anos de vida. Yo no me escape de verla con el algunas veces tambien. Hoy (gracias a Amazon) encontre este video el cual quiero compartir con mi hija para continuar la tradicion...
0312937385|4.0|Reading a book like this one is like taking a shower after backpacking for an entire week.  It just fits into the jigsaw puzzle of the mind making it intirely understandable and acknowledgeable, yet pushing you further into your thoughts than you'd have gotten on your own.  Orson Scott Card has a philosophical mind that translates itself onto paper like second nature and Speaker for the Dead is a prime example of his talents.<br />Once more Ender is challenged, but this time around he is old and wisened (though still young, but ignoring that...) and facing something completely different from his experience in Ender's Game.  But wait, is it so very different as all that?  Oddly enough, Ender finds himself again in the midst of a &quot;new&quot; species and soon must decide to either make the same mistake twice or come crashing down on a family's haphazardly repaired life.  What is he to do?<br />Though we may wonder with Ender's sister Valentine if Ender is getting in too deep, once more Ender seems the invicible figure that Ender's Game portrayed him as.  This is my one complaint with the book.  Card has made Ender into a god (hey, and he's practically immortal!).  He is ultimately faultless and so beyond the words intelligience and wisdom that they would cower before his greatness.  One might wonder if he himself is the fifth species to be discovered...<br />Other than this, I find Speaker for the Dead to be a wonderfully penned, thought-provoking book with insights rarely paralleled in science fiction literature.  In addition, the intrigue will hold you to the end.

B00004RHZU|3.0|Pink's album 'Can't Take Me Home' will appeal to those Rnb listners of such crooners as Aaliyah and Monica. But the point is her album has no pop appeal at all it is strait Rnb. This works for her dstintive voice. Although ballads dont really say Pink on them she could use a little more vocal range on them instead of sticking to her 2 to 3 octive range. Cmon pink! I know you can do better! Fave Track: Most Girls (oozes overproduction) Least Fave Track: I'm Falling (she did with this song)
0688101364|5.0|Dear Reader, Thank you for the universal praise of this book of my heart!  And thank you for your comment about the book binding problem--one that breaks my heart.  My only consolation is to say that it is easier to work with recipes that are loose as you can put them up on the wall with a special clip and also that you can have the book rebound with a stitched binding.  It is beautiful enough to warrant it. I also give you my word that my next book, which will be a comprehensive bread book, will be with a publisher who is willing to put in the contract that the book will have a stitched binding!  This is a rare thing in the American publishing industry these days because it is expensive, but in my opinion, a book that is going to be laid flat and used again and again in the kitchen and not just read once in bed requires and deserves it! Needless to say, do not xrox from it as that further encourages the glued binding to snap.

079073804X|5.0|As horror movies go, this is the leader of them all on many levels. It's a very intelligent, thought-provoking film. The horror in this movie cannot be catagorized and rationalized in any human capacity. For this reason, it is so unfathomable and unrealistic to people that they tend to come away amused and confused. But for those that dare to understand the meanings in this film, the reality of it all leaves you shaken to the very core-reaching for what little faith you have in your humble human existence. The evil portrayed in this film is not physical or tangible in any form: there are no serial killers here, no Jasons, no Freddy Kruegars. What we are dealing with here is evil in its' purest form. We avoid this movie, we're ignorant, we nervously laugh off its' implications but it's there. For how can you fight something that has no form? Something that is nowhere yet everywhere? Something that knows past, present and future? Something that is inside of you yet outside of you? Something that is part of you yet apart from you? Surely these are the questions that little Regan must be asking herself in whatever awareness she has left of herself apart from the spirits' presence within her.The reaity of this brings up other questions and realizations. Specifically, theological ones. The spirit is powerful, yes, but he does have his weaknesses but not in any human sense. He is as much a servant of Jesus as we are although on a different plane of existence. He knows this and he seeks to make us despair about our humanity. As you can see, he does this in the most obscence, disturbing, animal-like ways possible.(The masturbation with the cross) He takes our weaknesses and uses it against us, (Father Karras and his guilt over his mother.)In the end, we are sure of only two things and these two things we can never prove in any human capacity: Our faith in Jesus to love and forgive us for our sins and the gift that he gave us apart from his everlasting love: free will. For itis this free will that enables us to hold on to any vestiges of ourselves in struggling with the spirits. (The HELP ME that is written on Regan's stomach.)It is this inner struggle that brings on the convulsions and physical pain to poor Regan's body. She is fighting it barely. This is the stage that THE EXORCIST is played out on. For those of you who are already shaking your heads, I'd like to add this: Science is forever seeking life on other planets. Knowing the biological tree of life: humans... fish... bacteria... nanobacteria.. etc... life is in abundance. How arrogant are we to believe that life and inteligence stops with us? That if we can't measure it with our meager tools, it doesn't exist? What if?  JUST WHAT IF?  These are the questions that THE EXORCIST raises. For those that dare and are willing and able to search beyond the surface, the answers we might find are unimaginable and quite terrifying. For those of you who are interested in reading factual cases of demonic posession, I would highly recommend Malachi Martin's HOSTAGE TO THE DEVIL. He goes in to much detail about the stages of demonic posession and he explains wonderfully the very real relationship between Jesus, Lucifer and Humans. It is a very scholarly, terrifyingly real book.
0060977493|1.0|Having purchased the book in 97, I could only end it this month. Says something about the interest factor in the writing. Ms Roy has written a book which is by all means autobiographical. In parts it gets disjointed and shaky; at other parts the book goes haywire. Suddenly it shoots into a unknown terrain which has no link with the main story. The result CONFUSION CONFOUNDED! Damn it, this must be definitely art. It certainly is no real world story. But modern art's appeal lies in the hype surrounding the artist. SO the publishers have unleashed a campaign to tell us that if we cannot appreciate this, we must be uncouth!!!   The story is set in Kerala and is supposed to be the world as seen thru the eyes of a child. This much is okay. But what really got onto my nerves was showy phrases and corny digressions. The first page definitely is similar to Alan Paton's &quot; Cry the beloved country.&quot; Yet there is no passage which is really memorable or can make u emotional. The author has had a sad and disjointed life for sure. But this alone does not make for good literature. Anyway having gone to sleep at least a hundred times while trying to read this, I surely rate it as the best sleeping pill!
B000000WA4|5.0|...still I've got to say this is one of Smashing Pumpkins greatest moments on record. Perhaps THE greatest. As I just said there are a few songs that really don't improve the record...but there isn't really one BAD song out of 28. It doesn't really gets worse than OK, and that's very good for a double album. And Billy Corgan &amp; c:o have managed to put down some of their best songs ever on this record. It starts slowly with the beautiful instrumental piano-piece, which have the same title as the record, before we bursts into the joyous 'Tonight, Tonight' which also was a single and is one of the best SP-songs. Kind of reminds me of Springsteens 'Born To Run' LP, not in sound but rather in spirit: the same euphoria and 'everything-is-possible-this-very-night-let's-live-like-no-one-ever-lived-before'-message that can be found in 'Thunder Road' for an example. 'Zero' and 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings', also singles both of them, makes out a sharp contrast to the euphoria and popiness of the song just mentioned. Negative and more of a combination of rock and heavy metal, rather than joyous pop with string sections. 'Bullet...' is the better one, with Billy building up the tension in the verses just to explode in complete anger and rage in the chorus. I won't go through every song, mostly since I don't have rather time or space, but I can state that 'Mellan Collie...' quickly changes between entirely different moods. It's in other words as far as you can get from a 'heavy' album or a 'soft' album, or a 'negative' album or a 'happy' album. 'Mellan Collie...' is all these things and a lot more. I recommend this record from the depths of my heart: buy it, and learn to love '1979', 'Stumbeleine', 'Thru The Eyes Of Ruby', 'Galapagos', 'Tonight, Tonight', 'Bullet With Butterfly Wings', 'Zero', 'Muzzle', 'Bodies', 'Tales Of A Scorched Earth' and much much more.

B000001FLI|4.0|While this first album is all over the map musically, it does represent well the diversity of this awesome guitarist. Classic country pickin on Haunted House and Cajun, and the signature tune the Messiah Will Come Again all feature his distinct sound. Listening now to the sadness in Sweet Dreams seems to be a reflection of his life.  The beer hall classic, I Am a Lonesome Fugitive contains another brilliant guitar solo with, and for a Buchanan song...sometimes a rarity, first rate vocals.
B00003W8NM|2.0|The poor Gen-X'ers...trying so hard for a voice in movies and coming up with trash like this.<br />Brad Pitt has a line about guys his age being a generation of men raised by their mothers. Oh, brilliant. That's supposed to be insight? Sounds like Brad's character has a real grasp for the obvious.<br />Then this ridiculous plot twist half-way through that's supposed to be so incredible...yeah, incredible how it was stolen from a million other BETTER movies.<br />DO NOT be fooled by the hype: the fanatics who fall all over themselves praising this movie just want something to cling to and look down at the rest of us with a sneer that says &quot;Well you just don't understand.&quot;<br />Ladies and Gentleman, there's nothing to understand: Ed Norton is terrific, Brad Pitt is OK and you'll cringe when you see what they've done to poor MeatLoaf. <br />Oh, and just to make sure they're hip: there's a catch phrase repeated over and over in this movie that (was) meant to be chanted by all who saw it. It's a big laugh in the middle of a big bore.

0425129586|5.0|My name is Scott McCoy and as a requirment to get into Jesuit High School I had to read 1 of three books over the summer.  Of course I waited untill later in the summer but when I chose a book I chose and then there were none by agatha christie because it had to do with murders.  I didn't really want to read it but when I sat down for a second to read some of it I kept reading it because it was very interesting.  IT starts with ten different people that don't know each other on an island in a very large house.  Each one of these commited some sort of crime from manslaughter into 1rst degree murder.  Over the course of the book one by one die with the fact that there is someone on the island killing them off.  Every time there was a new murder I thought it was someone else.  No matter how good you are at guessing the outcome of mysterys you wouldn't be able to guess this one.  It is almost impossible yet you would think of him as a muderer early in the book then dismass him.  It was always hard to set the book down and go to bed or to go to dinner because you always want to find out who was behind the murders and who was going to be the next victim.  This book is pack with excitement and thrills and one great mystery which has the answer sealed in a bottle somewhere in the ocean. I would recommend this book to everyone and have fun.
B00004X01U|1.0|I was not impressed with Madonna's past 2 albums.  This new style of her music is not happening.  She needs to go back to doing her own material.  Dump William Orbit.  Madonna was famous for dance jams and this is a far cry from that.  When track 7 started I thought that my CD player was dirty. The only track that I would give two thumbs up to is the title track.  That is a funky beat.  Madonna needs to go back to working with her previous producers like Patrick Leonard, Nile Rogers, Stephen Bray, Shep Pettibone ...........these guys are the men that stood behind Madonna and help put her further on the map.  Just because you got a Grammy for \\"Ray Of Light\\" doesn't meant that the album was good it just means that the other contenders material was worse than \\"Ray Of Light\\" .........the lesser of two evils. This techno crap is not happening.  Madonna please make up with your next album and don't wait 2 years to produce it.  I have been a fan of your work for years.  Make a dedicated fan happy.

B00000IQBL|3.0|The dual nature of man, wherein he is able to embrace both war and peace simultaneously, is addressed by director Stanley Kubrick in the decidedly anti-war film, \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" starring Matthew Modine.  Divided essentially into two parts, the first half follows raw recruits through basic training at Parris Island, where the effects of what it takes to turn a man into a Marine / killing machine is explored, predominately through the characters of Private \\"Joker,\\" played by Matthew Modine, and Private Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), dubbed \\"Gomer Pyle\\" by the D.I, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey).  It's a hard, stoic study of techniques and motivation that inherently questions the system itself, and is deftly and succinctly illustrated by the results achieved, which are not entirely those desired.  It's hard stuff to swallow at times, but engrossing, and Kubrick manages to gradually build the emotional intensity that gives such impact to the climax of this first part, which is without question the strength of the entire film.  The second half switches suddenly to Vietnam, where Kubrick takes up his pallet and canvass, and while attempting to paint a realistic portrait of war, instead takes more of a turn away from reality, and the film takes on a sense of the surreal; the result is more reminiscent of the visual artistry of \\"The Thin Red Line\\" than of the truly gritty realism of \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and rather than make his statement  directly through the use of the story, he uses the movie to stage sequences of events to demonstrate the contradictory nature of war and it's consequences, and man's involvement therein.  And while he compares the moral and emotional conflicts with the physical, it is an acknowledgement of an inner struggle devoid of any proffered solution, though delivered quite subjectively.  The pace of the film is very deliberate and much of the dialogue has a \\"staged\\" sense about it that, rather than underscore the issues being addressed,has more of an alienating effect which serves to neutralize the emotional aspects of what is being presented.    The story is told from the point of view of Modine's \\"Joker\\" , but though Modine does a passable job, his is a rather unsympathetic character whose purpose it would seem is merely to act as narrator and to serve as the \\"eyes\\" of the camera.  And, again, it only manages to distance the audience further, as Joker becomes a kind of buffer between the viewer and any sustained level of emotional involvement with the story or any of the characters.  Instead of a stirring fulmination against the lunacy of war and man's enablement of it, Kubrick's approach creates more of a sense of rather cold ambiguity.  Had Joker (as the lead) been a stronger character, and had the second half of the film been more like the first, instead of nothing more than a series of vignettes, this could have been a dynamic movie; as it is, because of Kubrick's choices, he made a good movie, but not a great one.  There are two memorable performances here, one by Vincent D'Onofrio, who did an exemplary job of creating the hapless Leonard; the other by Lee Ermey, as the Gunnery Sergeant who could be the poster-boy for an anti-enlistment campaign.  Also worthy of note is the work of Arliss Howard, who brought \\"Cowboy\\" so credibly to life.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother); Dorian Harewood (Eightball); Kevyn Major Howard (Rafterman); Ed O'Ross (Lieutenant Tinoshky); and John Terry (Lieutenant Lockhart).  With \\"Full Metal Jacket,\\" Stanley Kubrick raises issues that are important, and makes some valid points about the causes and complexities of war, and the moral and ethical challenges of those presented with it.  Obviously, this was a passionate endeavor; if only he would have allowed more of that passion to make it's way onto the screen.  What a movie this could have been.

B00004U2NX|3.0|Ok, I usually love these kinds of movies. And I did like this one, but for other reasons than the story and movement of the movie. <br />The movie was VERRRRYYY SLLLLOOOOOWWWW moving and lengthy and it was hard to understand the words of the Vampire. <br />BUT...I WILL plug for it, that it had AWESOME gothic visuals. Moonlit forests and beautiful landscapes and castles and some gorgeous details of such things as the carraige that takes Lucy's man to the castle, the inside and the rooms of the castle itself,etc. Lucy also looked perfectly gothic for this movie. <br />The vampire reminded me of a sick person more than a vampire. Sorry! I know it was how the original version's vampire looked, I have yet to see it. I understand it is very good in spite of it's age and lack of technology. <br />I think this movie would be good to have on mute and use it as sort of a music video for alternative or appropriate hardrock music at parties. As I said there were some lush gothic scenes worth seeing but in the above mentioned way.
B00004SU5J|2.0|This record was advertised as a perfect blend of house music and jazz but in fact there is no balance between the two elements. This is basically house music with just a touch of jazz while I expected it to be the exact opposite : a jazz record with some electronica throughout. The tracks are generally  too long and I can assure you that they grow monotonous after a short while. Luc Navarre came up with a good idea (or at least with one that might look good at a first sight...). Instead of sampling old records like all his fellow djs do, he sampled a live jazz band playing in a studio and that's why I expected the record to sound more varied, I thought he would have given more space to improvisation but as I was saying none of this can be noticed. It's overly long, repetitive and pretentious because it strives to be more sophisticated than the average house music but ends up being just as boring as it. Save you money !<br />P.S. if you like this sort of experiments, try &quot;Session One&quot; by the Herbaliser Band instead. They move along the same lines but the result is ways better !
6301404440|5.0|This movie came out when I was 8, and I believed it!  Chalk it up to Robert Zemeckis, Steven Spielberg, Walt Disney animators and Industrial Light &amp; Magic FX technicians!    The story of Roger Rabbit accused of mudering gag king Marvin Acme makes for an intriguing story as we try to find out who did it.  It does seem hard to believe that help could come in the form of Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskin's greatest role).  Eddie is a man who's brother was killed by a toon, and since then, his life has gone downhill to teh point of over drinking alochol (making him a joke to many on the police force).  Roger Rabbit does what he does best: try to make Eddie crack a smile, and at the same time help him crack the case.  But Eddie not only has to put up with Roger, but a gang of insidious weasels out to stop Roger, a loud-mouthed cartoon cab, and the ever evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd during his Doc Brown years).   Many people go away form this movi remembering Jessica, and it's easy to see why: modeled after the female contour of aniamtion during the 40's and 50's, the animators capture the feminine charm that was instilled in the cartoons of the greats like Tex Avery.   The art is incredible for the fact that the characters do not wield Computer-generated props, but actual items (at times you can see the wires, which is funny), which the animators had to animate around.  The visual effects guys did an incredible job of adding little touches like shadows, lighting details on the characters, and much more.    Also the fun comes from seeing things that probably would never happen again, like seing Daffy and Donald battling it out over the Hungarian Rhapsody on Piano, and Mickey mouse and Bugs Bunny skydiving.
0062502182|4.0|When I read &quot;The Alchemist&quot; it was like I was reading an inspirational book or a parable that Jesus Christ told his followers.  I liked the book.  It kept me focused whether than thinking of other things.  I was intrigued by this book because I never knew what was going to happen next.  The author used a lot of detailed description and I got into the story.  I liked how the author was basically telling the way of life: not taking things for granted, always keep your head up high, and always seek your &quot;personal legend&quot;, as the book would call it.  The boy, Santiago, was seeking out his &quot;personal legend&quot; and along the way he was touched by others and learned from them that he should never give up on his hopes and dreams of the future.  This inspired me to rethink my life.  I used to hold negative thoughts of dreams that I would like to do that were &quot;out of this world&quot;  but &quot;The Alchemist&quot; got me to think a little bit.  The author was trying to capture the reader and guide him through his dreams and future.  He basically said that you can do anything if you just set your mind to it.  No matter how far away that treasure is, you must find it and dig it up.  This was a tool that inspired me.  I enjoyed this book.  I give it a 4+!
0881032565|3.0|I thought that and then there were none was an overall good book.  There were some ideas that were a little far-fetched, such as the identity of the killer and the entire ending of the book.  However, i thought that the 10 Little Indians poem added a very mysterious twist to the book; along with the 10 Indian figurines that one by one mysteriously dissapeared as each person was killed off.  Even though i was forced to read this book for summer reading, and it wasnt strictly for my enjoyment, i would recommend it to someone who is interested on reading a good mystery book.
B00004X01U|5.0|This c.d. is very Good it has some great tunes like Amazing,what it feels like to be a girl,gone(my personal favorite).It's definetly worth buying it great to listen to.It is probably one of Madonna's best work.
B00003CXDG|1.0|I worked at a movie theater when this came out, and we had the longest working day that MEmorial Day Weekend.  We had a showing of this for the employees, and many of us left the theater all believing this thing was overhyped (they send us window clings and some 20 posters! ).  I heard people coming out of this going &quot;IT's the best movie I've ever seen!&quot;  Apparently, these people must never have seen anything decent.   My biggest complaint about the movie is probably John Woo.  Whiel is action style may work elsewhere, here it just became annoying.  In one scene, Cruise searches for Thandie NEwton while the camera keeps cutting between him looking and a dancer downstairs in a village.     This was probably one movie that was only sold on pretty-boy Cruise than anything else.  The entire movie he makes smart little quips and just seems to smile for the camera (the bad guy tells him that at one point &quot;the hardest part about impersonating him was grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes&quot;).  Even the bad guy has the most cheesy accent, and lines.  The missions turn into Mission: ridiculous, not at all anything like the suspend over the room or chunnel sequence of the first.  To make matters worse, Woo throws in the full gamut of explosions and a motorcycle chase/ beach battle near the end that had me rolling my eyes.  I guess making 200 million dollars proves one thing about the movie-going public: It takes all kinds of idiots to make a world, and next summer, your stupid loving of this movie will cause more like it to be made.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|I'll always love Bjork's wonderful innovative and beautiful work, and at one time I strove to own everything she put out.  She is and will always be my favorite musician/singer.  These songs too are fabulous and will occupy perminant storage in my ears and brain.  But only 4 stars for just 7 tracks.  I cant wait to see the movie!
B000000WA2|5.0|Come on! How can you dis &quot;Ohhhhhhhhhhh he lives in a HOUSE! A very big HOUSE in the country!!!!!!!!!&quot;
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|Stay a way from this movie. Although the trailers make this movie out to be a hilarious spoof, they are lying. This movie has about 5 minutes of actual spoof comedy, the rest is sex joke. And they aren't even funny. They consist of pubic hair, sveral comments(and visual aids) about how &quot;big&quot; a guy is, the &quot;first time&quot;, and several homosexual jokes. There are very few funny scenes, the rest are just gross. So any one under 13, and over sixteen should not see this movie. I'm Kale Arndt and that's my story and I am sticking to it.
B00003CXE6|1.0|I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie.  This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-(
B0000025YM|2.0|Ok first off, this is NOT Priests best album ever. I am a huge metal fan. I hate new stuff like Limp Bizkit and Korn and rap and mostly anything new (except Halford and new Maiden). I love Maiden, Priest, Megadeth, Iced Earth, Halford, Queensryche etc..REAL metal. But this is just...it's not that great. Yes, the riffs are good. Robs a killer vocalist. The guitar solos are ok...but the lyrics are just horrible. Eat me Alive? What the hell is Freewheel Burning about? And Defender of the Faith. Obviously, Faith is probably heavy metal music...and Judas Priest are supposedly Defenders of it. I know that Priest has never been strong with their lyrics (their 80's albums that is) but this is probably the worst Priest album for lyrics. The album also sounds really digital also...that's something that also takes some points away. No heart in the music. Listen to WASP &quot;Crimson Idol&quot; or Sentenced &quot;Crimson&quot;...now that's heart. It's not digitalized like this album. It's just great playing, great lyrics, and great feeling. Feeling...thats what this album is lacking, and that is the most important ingredient to any metal album. <br />Secondly, this is NOT Priests best album. Painkiller, while having stupid lyrics also, is probably Priests best. It's heavy, it's not digital sounding, and has alot of great music and solos. Of course, Stained Class or Sad Wings is probably their best in terms of being groundbreaking for thei time, but I think the best showcase of Judas Priest is in Painkiller...heaviness, great vocals, and very melodic. <br />This is NOT the best Priest album, let alone best metal album ever. I am a musician, so I really notice what is good or not (in my opinion). The guitar solos are just a bunch of whammy bar bends and squeals. Yes, there are a few solos which are really good, but must are just really mediocre. This is not really that great of an album.
6303402348|4.0|Listen to the whole detailed life story of smart-at-heart Forest Gump, told by himself to strangers sittin at a bench with worn out shoes waiting for the bus to visit his first and only love Jenny while holding his box of chocolates and his briefcase with a feather in a childrens book, only to find out Jenny only lives a block away. This truely is a good movie, played very well by Tom Hanks.
0783243499|5.0|This movie really craked me up.  Thank goodness for Mary Hutton adding some humor to this story that I thought was just plain sick.  Christian Bale did a wonderful performance has the serial killer, Patrick Bateman.  The very end of the story makes me wonder if there will be a &quot;American Psycho 2,&quot; depending on if Bret Easton Ellis wants to write another novel about Patrick Bateman.  The music for this movie is great, but the soundtrack does not contain the 80's music which really is a blow.
6305537798|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies right now along with Never Been Kissed and Clueless. It's a funny, and sorta romantic movie about a new high school student, Cameron, who right away falls for Bianca, a girl who everyone knows is not allowed to date, until now, her older sister, the anti social undateable, but pretty Kat does. Cameron tries desperatly to find a date for kat, he finally pays a strage mysterious guy to date her. This is Very funny and Very good! It stars Larissa Oleynic, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Heath Ledger.
B000002L9B|5.0|This is bar-none the best Prince CD I own, and I own 19 Prince Albums!!!  The songs are all well-produced and well-orchestrated, but the true beauty of &quot;Parade,&quot; in my opinion, is how well-mixed the whole album is.  Every song fits with the one that came before and the one that comes after.  This is not the kind of CD where you can take songs off and put them on a mix tape, or one that can be stopped in the middle.  It is a CD meant to be listened to in its entirety every time. &quot;Parade&quot; is by far the most innovative, introspective and fun album that was ever made by Prince and the Revolution.<br />(By the way, my favorite songs are &quot;I Wonder U,&quot; &quot;Under the Cherry Moon,&quot; &quot;anotherloverholenyohead,&quot; and &quot;Sometimes It Snows in April.&quot;  Whether or not this will help you i don't know, i just felt like saying it.)<br />Enjoy!!
B00001ZWTS|1.0|I sorra, but I thought this was a pretty dumb movie. It was a bore so much that I couldn't follow it well enough. It does have some good music and Will Smith though!
0345363132|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book. As a trained historian, I tend to squirm at historical fiction. A friend introduced me to Penman. I am glad he did. This book is a sweeping look at Yorkist England. A new theory about the murder of the York princes accompanies a very interesting and sympathetic portrait of Richard III. read it slowly. Savor its length.
B00000JG3X|3.0|This band is pretty cool, I don't have this cd right now, but I do like the song &quot;Californication&quot; It's a lot better than that stupid scar tissue song the did last. But this, this song is coo.
B000000OPW|4.0|Post punk.  Textural music, effect driven, lush with reverb like a lot of 80's stuff.  Bass lines are linear, usually, synched with creative drum patterns.  Siouxie's voice is, of course, the main attraction.  No one can sing like she does.  <br />If you like the 80's wave pop like the Cure, Echo and the Bunnymen,or Psychedelic Furs, or modern darkwave stuff, then you'll like this. <br />The atmosphere reminds me of a dark fable, like an old Grimm fairytale.  I like the cover, its dark scarlet colors, because I often see colors with music, and that scarlet color is what the music sounds like.  <br />Fave songs: candyman, cities in dust. Dud: 92 degrees
B000002LQR|4.0|This is an incredible CD from a band who knows how to combine rock and rap. The sounds off this Cd tend to lean more towards rock, though. Their somewhat soft song, &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; is one of my favorites all time because of it's great beat. The lyrics make you want to smile and cry at the same time. When I saw them in concert, a fairly wild crowd calmed down and lit their lighters for that great song. &quot;Give It Away&quot; is a classic Red Hot Chili Peppers song. This song is one of many that prove that they are the best band ever at finding a happy middle of rock and rap. This song makes you want to get up and move your body ever time you hear it. Also, their other big hit from this Cd, &quot;Breaking The Girl&quot; is a great song. It is a little bit more rock than &quot;Give it Away&quot; and a bit harder then &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, but all this variety just makes the CD great. If you love any of those three, you will definitly love the other two when you hear them. The rest of the Cd is good, but not good enough to listen to it over and over. This Cd is a must buy though. If you don't have it, you don't know what Red Hot Chili Peppers are all about.
6305165912|5.0|You already know about the movie, I want to talk about the DVD. It looks great. It sounds great. The 30 minute interview with the Coen Brothers was interesting to say the least. Those two can really come up with some great characters to tell a story. That's why I bought this movie... because the characters were so great and the actors did such a good job portraying them. The dialogue in this movie was well written. I wish I could write like these guys. Which brings me to my only complaint about the DVD. It dosen't come with english subtitles! It has closed captioning but I like subtitles better. I thought this was  &quot;very undude&quot; for them to do. Still a great one for your collection.
0812548094|5.0|Well I finshed reading the 2nd book and 3rd(which I'll review later) the 2nd book was not bad I really enjoyed it, I know some readers pointed out inthier reviews that they didn't like the so-called graphic sex scenes and could do with out them(especially one reader who only read 1/3 of the book). While there is one scene with the Sisters of Darkness and a Demon,where as part of being a member of the Sisters of Dark they had sex with the Demon the rest of the book was not bad. and the Romance between Rithard and Kahlan was tested to the limit they managed to see it threw.Richard is in my opinion a good character but a bit of a hipocrite who say one thing and does another. Example: he says he doesn't like to hurt people and kill them(which is fine)but turns around and says he is going to kill the sisters of light if they stand in his way of being free of them. I know from the first book he had a bad experiance with the Mord-Sith and the coller he had around his neck, but Kahlan only did it because she loved him and wanted to save his life. I just want to say I can't wait to read the rest of the series. I highly recommened this series.
6304595247|2.0|I just love to look at Juliette Binoche with her innocent and very expressive eyes.....Was darling in this movie and in certain scenes reminded me of Julie Roberts,especially the somewhat swollen upper lip.....The music is hauntingly beautiful...
0316286443|4.0|Based on the same principles as Making Faces, Kevyn Aucoin created a reasonable sequel of his first book.  However, making faces definitely had something in it that Face Forward is missing.  If you liked Making Faces, I would recommend getting this book, too, but if you want to get one or the other, I would recommend Making Faces.
0425156842|5.0|Reviewers who complain the plot of this book is weak, that the ending is a &quot;cop-out&quot;, that the story line gets &quot;too weird&quot; have, in my opinion, totally misunderstood the point of the novel, and have not paid proper attention to the philosophy lectures embedded in the novel.  READ THE SUBTITLE - it's a novel about the history of philosophy!  The clues to the plot are in the philosophy, and the plot, as well as the ending, make perfect sense provided you have understood the philosophy.<br />I would like to thank the reviewer who warned me not to read the Kirkus review.  WARNING AGAIN - DO NOT READ THE KIRKUS REVIEW UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE BOOK!   AMAZON, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS REVIEW - IT GIVES THE WHOLE GAME AWAY!
B000001GBJ|5.0|Songs from a Secret Garden is a collection of Classical/Celtic/New Age music that will make you want to cry, sing, and just bask in the warm sun all at the same time.  I came across this CD while I was surfing through Amazon, and saw a link to here from a Loreena Mckennitt Amazon page.  I played the first clip (NOCTURNE) on my real player and was inthralled with utter beauty of it.  I went to the next clip...and had the same experience etc etc.  I ordered it immediately, and let me tell you...this CD is so calming and medidtative to the body and spirit, that I think everyone needs to own this!  Some say this CD lacks quality, but I strongly dissagree.  This CD will be a great buy for anyone!  Get it, and enjoy the hauntingly peaceful beauty of it!  If you buy this, this music will be the gardener of your heart.
0679720200|4.0|Personally, I had to read this book for an ENglish class that I needed to graduate with. A friend in telling me about the book implied that the guy was a selfish so and so, and when I read it, I felt that Mersault just didn't care one way or the other what he wanted.Just because he didn't cry at his own mother's funeral, they handed him a harsh sentence?? No previous crimes, no rap sheet, alright, he took a life, one life that didn't have nothing to do with him except for his friend making him do it. Let's look at this. The guy had no goals, no ambitions, no nothing. He has a girl, but it don't mean a thing to him one way or the other. Does that make him amoral?? I feel it makes him irresponsible,unfeeling, and aimless.
B000001ELR|5.0|After three experimetal albums, KISS is back! Creatures, I Love It Loud, War Machine, and Danger are exellent. It is their best since Love Gun. There are no cheesy Peter or Ace songs here. All Ther KISS CD's you need to buy are KISS thru ALIVE II and then CREATURES OF THE NIGHT!! I really love this album, I listen to it in the house, in the car, everywhere. There is not a song that resmebles filler. Also buy Love Gun and Alive!

B000001ELB|2.0|I have always had a problem with this album. Shout It Out Loud should be on here instead of Do You Love Me, Christine Sixteen should be on here instead of Cold Gin, and Shock Me or Plaster Caster should be on here instead of She. Also why is there no material from the band best album, ALIVE? Also when Neil Bogart asked them to re-record -Disco-Strutter, they ruined a classic song. Many of they remixes suck like Calling Dr. Love or Firehouse. This and many others make you ask yourself if you want this or you are getting it to complete the collection.
0684800713|5.0|Writing a reader review of a classic might be considered a fool's errand (what is there to say that hasn't been said) but my re-reading of Fiesta made a sufficiently strong impression on me that I'm motivated to say a few words.<br />I'd originally read this book ten years ago as a college undergraduate; a chore forced upon me as part of a course requirement.  In the years that followed I've become a fan of contemporary writers like Richard Ford, J. M. Coetzee, and Howard Norman for their brutally economical style.  But upon my re-reading of Fiesta I'm reminded of what I perhaps knew all along - it all started with Hemmingway.<br />In Fiesta, as in all of Hemmingway's works, you find yourself concentrating on what is said, rather than how it is said.  This makes the characters compelling and real.  One thing that makes this novel a classic is the fact that the characters are as immediate and relevant now as they were when the novel appeared in 1926.<br />The book has a variety of lively and beautiful settings throughout the Spanish countryside, focusing famously on the bullfights in Pamplona.  Hemmingway brings these sights and sounds to life.  In terms of human nature, however, there isn't much pretty to be seen.  Envy, alcoholism, racism, and despair are the main currents of emotion, consuming a group of rich well-bred expatriates who on the surface shouldn't have a care in the world..<br />A powerful, subtle, novel.  If you, like me, were beaten over the head with this novel as part of your college literature requirements then give it another try.
0425170349|4.0|Having worked in industry among real-life environmentalists, I would say there probably really are people as nutty, self righteous, dangerous AND well-connected as the sinister group described in TC's Rainbow Six. The antagonists' plot to wipe out all humans, except the environmental elite who &quot;get it&quot; (themselves) -- and thereby provide an opportunity to repopulate earth -- is plausible enough to make you worry at night. With its typical TC focus on techno-weapons, action, anti-terrorist military tactics and world-class danger, the book was as compelling as it was unique. Highly recommended.
B000000WCX|5.0|I first heard this album on my way up to Breazy Point with Hob. I had the windows down and the bass pushing some serious air. Then got to dance to it in the clubs. But it wasn't until I listened to it out of a computer and into my headphones that I absorbed this masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and put this through good headphones and prepare yourself. I missed David Bowie on this tour and have been in pain everyday since. Atleast I have a tape of his birthday party in NewYork.
B00004TWZK|5.0|You have to check this one out.  What a story!  Each of the four friends does at least some growing up on their journey -- okay, maybe not Vern so much, but they all do at least a little.  I don't want to merely recap what happens in the movie, you can find dozens of summations of the film on this page...  Corey Feldman should get more praise, I think, for his portrayal of Teddy.  Teddy is the wild kid in this film, whose dad was a military man who &quot;stormed the beach at Normandy&quot;, as we hear quite often in the movie.  Teddy really isn't intended to be the main character by any means, but as Kurt Vonnegut sometimes said, you really should pay attention to all the characters, because they're all human beings.  Otherwise stories, whether they are books or movies, can skew the way you look at the world, if you only care about the &quot;protagonist&quot; in some ongoing drama in your life.  Teddy is kind of a nutcase, but he seems to at least have dreams, and to try to have some integrity when it counts...  I thought he was a pretty good character.  Vern, played by Jerry O'Connell, is a good kid too, by his lights...  It is hilarious to see chubby, timid, Vern and realize that today Jerry O'Connell is probably the hottest actor of the four -- I'm not being fair to the late River Phoenix by saying that, but you see what I mean...  John Cusack, in one of his early appearances, is really warm and sympathetic here.  It makes you glad he's had such a terrific career.  Keifer Sutherland, not unusually for him in movies of this kind, plays the town jerk, a sort of charismatic hoodlum.  I guess this must have been a sort of reunion for him and Corey Feldman of their &quot;Lost Boys&quot; days, because they play very similar roles in each film, even to the extent of defining their characters through their conflicts with each other.  Wil Wheaton is the main character, and he is terrific.  He is very convincing as the introspective kid who wonders if being introspective makes him &quot;weird&quot;.  Also, I want to say that I really enjoyed the story he tells, of the pie eating contest.  Especially the way the actors play out the story -- it really looks like, and has the feel of, a gross-out revenge story being told by a twelve year old kid.  Just terrific.   When it comes right down to it, however, I agree with the basic gist of people's opinion here that River Phoenix stole the show with his character of Chris Chambers, the tough kid with a heart.  The film carries a nice message, too, in the way Chris is shown to find the ability to rise above his poor background and eventually make something of himself in life.<br />Basically, you walk away from this movie feeling thoughtful, and pleasantly melancholy. I found myself full of warm memories of young friendships, and things that can only be shared between friends close enough to get down and dirty, cussing out each others mothers, and still hang out afterwards and share some Pez and root beer.  Two thumbs up.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This really is a beautiful story, and who better to tell it than David Lynch.  The lead, played by Richard Farnsworth, could not possibly have been better casted.  The acting, the cinematography, the music and all of the elements that come together to make a great movie are here.  While the idea of &quot;Lynch gone Disney&quot; has scared a lot of his avid fans away, he did an incredible job; the film does contain a few quirky Lynch moments too.
0671042858|5.0|Trisha McFarland is lost in the woods and I found myself lost in the pages of this book. When I started reading The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon, I didn't stop until I was done. Stephen King puts the reader into his characters like no other and this is one of the best I've read. I haven't read a lot of King's works, but I haven't read a bad one yet. I found myself becoming Trisha, feeling, seeing, and smelling what see did. I cared for her and worried about her (something I don't do very often).<br />To those who complained about its size, I would just like to say that it's the same as complaining about a movie being too long. A story is told in a determined amount of time. No more and no less... Stephen King transported me into Trisha for a wild, suspensful trip. All I can say is Bravo!
B000006OBQ|5.0|This album is the best introduction to Frank Sinatra's music I know of.  It's the one to lend to a friend who wants to know why people love Sinatra so much.  Sinatra belts out one great song after another, ranging from up-tempo swingers (&quot;Come Fly with Me&quot;, &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, &quot;My Kind of Town&quot;) to softer, more intimate tunes (&quot;I've Got a Crush on You&quot;, &quot;The September of my Years&quot;, &quot;The Shadow of Your Smile&quot;) and, lest we forget, Sinatra's trademark drowning-my-sorrows-cause-my-baby-left-me anthems (&quot;One for my Baby&quot;, &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;).  As if that isn't enough (and gosh, don't you think it oughtta be?) you also get Sinatra's banter with the audience, including a brave attempt at doing stand-up comedy (from which I gather that Dean Martin was known to drink a bit :-)).  Even though the sound may not be as polished as on some of the studio albums, Sinatra at the Sands gives you a feel for the phenomenon that was Frank Sinatra in a way that none of his other recordings can.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Originally I wanted the CD only for the  'Here with Me' song. When I received the CD I was very suprised. I live in the UK and had never heard of 'DIDO' so I didn't know what to expect. I found the music to be fantastic. It is the sort of CD you can chill out to and really enjoy. The songs are excellent and the vocals unique. I have played the CD to many of my friends and they all want me to order them copies now.  'No Angel' is my favorite CD and goes with me every where.....not because I am sad, but because it is in my CD player in the car.  If you like good music and you are looking for a fantastic CD, you can do no better than buying 'No Angel'.
B00004X01U|5.0|Madonna has once again changed her musical style just when you thought you had a handle on it.  But if she didn't, she wouldn't be Madonna now would she?  This is a great album, although I must admit it has taken listening to it 4-5 times to get used to the new style.  The first three tracks are too similar for my taste.  Any one of them would have been a great song by itself, but the three of them together can be a bit much.  Don't get me wrong - great dance tracks!  But when I first listened to the album, I was starting to worry that Madonna had finally fallen into the trap of many one hit wonders - the album that is really one long song.  But when I finally had the chance to really listen to the album, I realized that it is great!  Many of the songs really have their own soul and beauty.  Don't expect much of anything like Ray of Light.  It's nothing like that, except for some soul searching lyrics.  Madonna has definitely centered in on another sound all together.  One that fits her rather well!  Highly recommended!
B000002L7Y|5.0|This song can put in a lot of different modes and can give you determination while listening to it.&quot;Take On Me&quot; is a great song.
B000002VMH|5.0|This CD is worth more than the selling price!  As I said in my title; the three songs were &quot;Cold, Money Can't Buy It, and Little Bird.&quot;  I was really excited when I received the CD, and inspired me to dance more.
B00004X01U|3.0|I have read all the reviews on this album and have been searching for a rating which is lower than 4 amongst all the 5 stars. Is `Music' really that good? Well, undeniably, this album sets its foot into a new territory, French House. Well, the sound of Mirwais is extremely reminiscent of Daft Punk, Funkmop and Cassius, even Air. sometimes. I have Mirwais' `Production', so I know how this fellow's music sound like. He is a good French house/disco artist, but definitely not great. He is hardly genre-defining, well, leave that to Daft Punk, Air or Bang Bang, can you? He is even not as good as Alex Gopher, whose `You, My Baby and I' was a much more funkier affair than `Production'. Mirwais producing for Madonna?  I thought it was a good idea before I heard the album.  Well, the result, well, I would say it's ok, my conscience told me not to write this album off, although I really want to and it is really not that impressive. There are a few impressive instants here, but William Orbit doesn't own one here.  `Impressive Instant' is one, the track is an amalgam of the cuteness of Aqua, the cheesiness of Mr. Ozio and ATB, the vocoder effect of...well, many others, such as Cher and...everybody else, Radiohead, Portishead and Bjork, blah blah blah. However, this song is mainly a homage to Daft Punk, 3 years after `Homework' was released, their landmark album's influence is shown on such a huge pop star's album. Congratulations!  The first single `Music' is another one, it is quite captivating, although this is hardly a breath of fresh air to me. I can do a body-moving to this song, but it is not driving me crazy, the music simply doesn't have the zest. `Nobody's Perfect' could be the best song on the album, the vocoder effect is so exotic, and the beats are so kinky, it makes you wanna do a striptease in front of your everybody on the street. It reminds me of  `le voyage de penelope' by Air, which has the same effect on everyone. `I Deserve It' should have appeared on Beth Orton's album, it sounds exactly like a Beth Orton song, not only the production, arrangement, even the melody sounds like Beth. Ever wonder how Beth is feeling right now? Feeling proud of herself? Pissed off? 'Paradise(Not For Me)' is stolen from Mirwais' `Production'. It is not improbable that everybody is feeling unjust. Yeah I know, Madonna's vocal appeared on this track, so that makes this track a Madonna track? Good, so this is a Madonna track! The beats sound like Stereolab or... worse: the Creatures. Did Mirwais use bamboo sticks or xylophone? Anyway, our queen sounds like a witch, well if she sounds like a queen here, it must be a drag queen, which is horrible! What the heck did Mirwais ask her to do? I bet our Mr. Ahmadzai clubbed her, did something with her...you know what I mean. Then he blindfolded her and made her sing like a strangled cat. It is obvious that Madonna has a pretty voice, but Mirwais made it sound awful, my gawd!  Would you pass me that bottle of aspirin over there? This track smells like garlic, oh, no!  It is making my headache worse and the rest of the album is unbearably garlic like, too!  I am sorry but I cannot complete this review, take care of yourself, Madonna fans... b...by...bye...
B0000004V2|5.0|For a standard vocalist, guitarist, bass player, and drummer, British pop/rock doesn't get any better. Forget Oasis, The Stone Roses first release is the standard.<br />I started listening to this CD about three years ago. I wasn't lucky enough to have the exposure to the band when they were relatively unknown outside of England. Lucky for me that when I did hear it, I found it excellent.<br />The songs might not have been too radio friendly when released. Only 'She Bangs The Drums', 'Elephant Stone', and 'Sugar Spun Sister' (not including 'Elizabeth My Dear') are under 4 minutes. The rest of the songs contain classic verses and choruses, but also aren't in a rush. The last two songs 'I Am The Resurrection' and 'Fools Gold' are both over eight minutes, and worth every second.<br />The music is relatively straight forward. Basic chord changes. You won't hear sonic layers like 'Pet Sounds' from the Beach Boys (I just listened to that one). Guitar, vocals, bass, and drums eloquently fused to create a beautiful coherent sound. Classically simple. It's the kind of music that every garage or high school band might be capable of creating, but just don't. That is the lure of this music for me. Maybe, just maybe, it isn't beyond my grasp.<br />As far as favorite tracks. I'll leave aside the obvious picks. 'Elephant Stone' shouldn't be missed. Listen for some of the drumming, snares especially. <br />Enjoy.
0881032565|5.0|Well this was my first Agatha Christie Novel. At first I wasn't to sure about this book, but now that I am finished I am happy I chose this book. There were many different areas that put me in more suspense than others. Such as the twelve Indians that kept dissapearing. This made me wondering why they were disappearing and it kept me involved. Towards the end I had an idea who the killer was, but as always I was wrong. Hopefully this book will bring you the mystery and suspense it brought me.
B00003CWNR|5.0|In the time it took me to pick up a DVD of &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; off of the shelf and walk down the aisle to the cash register four different people noticed it in my hands and stopped to tell me how great of a movie it was.  It eased my mind about my indecision to purchase it and I proudly whipped out my check book!  All four people were of different ages from 17 to 60. I think that amazed me the most.  <br />The main issue encompassing the movie is &quot;abortion&quot;.  Both sides of the issue are shown; and, no matter where you stood originally it made you realize that maybe there isn't a right or wrong in all situations.  The abortion issue is there...but, it is not jammed down your throat.  Actually, it is a movie where all of the characters have their own story.  All of the storys gently fit together to make one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.<br />All of the characters in this movie are strong and unforgettable!  I can see why Michael Cain (who plays the doctor of an orphanage) won an oscar.  However, it was Tobey Maquire (who plays young, coming of age &quot;Homer&quot;) who deserved an Oscar for his performance.  I'm not sured how his performance was overlooked because his performance shined like a big, bright star!  <br />I won't go into a long synopsis of the movie since you can read it in the Amazon.com synopsis above.  However, I will say that this is definately a movie worth seeing more than once!
B00004X01U|4.0|Perhaps that is the question asked by most music buyers today. With the media blitz of Madonna's latest release one only has to look to our savior for help. Once again she &quot;has done it&quot;. Madonna has created a musical extravaganza that is a sweet tune to the ears. This album cannot be catagorized like many. There are hints of pop, funk, r&amp;b, and dare I say country. Listenting to the track &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; I felt wisked away to the lonesome prarie campfire where M was having a camp out. One flaw may be that there is too much &quot;business&quot; going on throughout the album. Sometimes the endusement of electronica overshadows her voice and leaves the listener saying &quot;turn down the noise, I can't hear Madonna's voice&quot;. Other than that, a MUST have for any MUSIC fan.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|This was a movie that was made for summer. It had it all, big stars, numerous exotic fast stars, but why did i tire of it so quickly? There could be numerous reasons, but the underlying factor is that there has to be more to a movie than a two hour car chase scene. It was from Bruckheimer, so it was stylish action sequences, but once you see them steal one car, you have seen it all.  There was some sort of a plot about his brother who would die if they could not get all the cars, but there was not enough character development done so you would be able to care whether they could pull the whole thing off. And the villian was a carpenter whose weakness was seeing his wooden creations get destroyed. Very clever stuff.
B000002AH1|5.0|This cd is a bizarre collection in that it meshes live and studio tracks in peculiar areas, yet in doing so makes the cd almost flawless in character.<br />Miles was on a roll during this period, and these tracks show as much. The hard funk of James Brown and Sly Stone meet Jimi Hendrix in Miles'tone, Mclaughlin's guitar playing, Corea and Jarrett's fender explorations, the Brazilian/African grooves of Airto Moriera... they all contribute wonderfully to the sonic landscape being created.<br />A problem with the old copies (I have owned a Japanese import of this for 13 years now, so I have not bought the re-mastered cd, so I can't be sure here) was that the list of players on the cd was very incomplete, leaving out Hermeto Pascoal, Steve Grossman, Michael Henderson, Leon Chandler, and Gary Bartz for the roles they played. The cd was so well made that the live dates were simply overlooked and it was assumed that Hancock, Shorter, Carter or Dave Holland and DeJohnette played all of the material. Hopefully, Columbia has straightened that problem out, but if they have not, and anyone needs an exact list of who played what when, feel free to email me, and I'll send it along.<br />Despite that major flaw, the music is all mighty on this disc, and for 1970-71, Miles' electric funk ruled the roost, picking up where Hendrix left off, going where Sly didn't dare venture, out funking Funkadelic. The grooves are deep and funky, the tracks red hot. &quot;Live-Evil&quot; is a masterpiece.
B000002GYI|4.0|1981's Computer World was German electronic pioneers Kraftwerk's last great studio album. In all the Computer World lasts 32 minutes (hence only 4 stars), however it is an absolutely flawless work, which still sets the standards in modern techno and electronica.<br />As with their other best work such as Trans-Europe-Express and the Man Machine, Computer World contains the usual Kraftwerk's blend of electronic instruments and geometrically perfect beats, elegant European melodies and a touch of campness and quirkiness in the lyrics and vocal department. Where Computer World beats Trans-Europe and Man Machine hands down is in the electronic drumming and beats, much harder and tighter and more dynamic than on their previous album - in short Computer World sounds as modern as any of today's techno.<br />It's a concept album of sorts, about you guessed the World of computers. Starting off with the title track, a pulsating tune, with lyrics about FBI and Scotland Yard. Then there is the fine \\"Pocket Calculator\\" with the immortal lyrics \\"I'm the operator with pocket calculator\\".  Later on there is \\"Computer Love\\" - a foretelling of today's obsessions with Internet chat rooms. The final two tracks \\"Home Computer\\" and \\"Its more fun to Compute\\" - two tracks based on the same tune close the album in such a way as too leave you absolutely staggered. These tracks in contrast to the fun on Pocket Calculator the last two tunes paint a rather bleak picture of the future in the computerised world.
B000002AGM|5.0|&quot;Miles Ahead +19&quot; is an unusual lp when first listened to. It's not quite jazz, not quite orchestral work. It's a beautiful hybrid of the 2 that has stood the test of time well. Gil Evans asserts his mastery of composition as well as his understanding of what Miles can coax out of his trumpet (and flugelhorn on this cd), and does both masterfully.<br />The coup of this cd is that it has been properly re-mastered and restored to what it was in 1957. Several bad releases made this lp unlistenable for a long time (I have a mono lp copy that I got 15 years ago and it sounds terrible), but Columbia has finally solved that problem.<br />This lp can also be had as part of the superb Miles Davis/Gil Evans box set that covers this, &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; &quot;Sketches of Spain,&quot; and &quot;Quiet Nights,&quot; as well as a few tracks they did in the late 60's. Highly recommended... and if you can't get that set, then of course, this lp is very much recommended.
6303365809|5.0|My mother and I just LOVE Hello Kitty!  I was just surfing our Netscape Navigator (my internet) when I saw something that caught my eye. HELLO KITTY MOVIES! I thought it looked cute, so I decided to look for more info. Kitty and Mimmy are for all ages, I agree! Don't you? Their very cute! :))) Sanrio has a hit cartoon!  Hello Kitty and Mimmy are so cool. I should have known there were Kitty and Mimmy Movies! Mimmy's Yellow bow and Kitty's Red bow! Their such addorible kittys!  Who could resist such cute little kitten's? Talk about cool movies, they have, like, 100!  Pretty darn cool, huh? Six year olds think Hello Kitty shows are just for them!  Think again, Preschoolers! I'm only ten years old and I'm in love with Kitty and Mimmy! I thought that was cool and cute to see that they make movies of Hello Kitty and her world of friends! Just think, to have over one thousand friends in the world!
B000002LAB|3.0|&quot;Tutu&quot; ranks as one of my least favorite of Miles works (though almost all of this 80s works fall in this category). From the moment I first heard it, the passion wasn't there; and even if Miles'lp's have nothing else, they are carried by his passion.<br />I'm not saying to avoid this lp- try it, you might like it, but for me it fails miserably. I'm sorry, Miles.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Straight story is a true story of one elderly man's passion and perseverance. He longs to see his estranged brother but his only means of transport is a lawnmower and his brother is far away even by car.<br />The interaction of this fellow with his shocked neighbors and townspeople is amazing and the story as warm and sweet as any  film in recent memory. enjoy!
B000002LTU|4.0|The fusion of hip hop and jazz had to happen at some point- and Miles was the only logical choice to do it, seeing as many of his 70's funk grooves pointed the way towards hip hop, instrumentally speaking.<br />While Miles' supposed colaborations with Prince would have been more commercially viable, these recordings are not terrible. Yes, the rapping itself is lame and trite, but the concept unto itself is what mattered. And for that, Miles delivered some very confident playing.<br />While certainly not essential listening, &quot;Doo-Bop&quot; did re-prove the obvious- Miles did everything his way, when he wanted to do them. Jazz and hip hop have merged some since, and will continue to do so, and when it breaks loose, as I'm sure it will, we can once again say &quot;Miles was ahead of his time.&quot;
B000002L68|5.0|For unclear reasons, the term `genius' finds itself applied to cultural giants, by virtue of their popularity and nothing else. Yes, Prince is a giant of popular culture, but his music is indicative of something transcending any spot upon the Billboard 100. Prior to Purple Rain, Prince established himself as a critical favorite with Dirty Mind and 1999, so this album can be thought of, in part, as a quest for greater name recognition. <br />Regardless of whatever merit, or lack thereof, one finds in a quest for greater popularity, the eclectic brilliance of Purple Rain cannot be denied. In successfully managing hard rock (Let's Go Crazy), metal (Darlin' Nikki) and interspersing it with balladry (Beautiful Ones), Prince placed himself among the greatest musical minds of the past 25 years.<br />The greatest moments of the album occur when Prince becomes self-revelatory, showing himself vulnerable to emotions that haunt most of us at various points during our lives. `When Doves Cry' (no discernable genre) tells of a man looking for the reason(s) behind the demise of a relationship; out of this turmoil he releases a series of frustrated screams.     <br />Purple Rain invokes the spirit of Hendrix (superior melodic structure) with Prince asking for redemption; the lyrical content is minimal, and ultimately the guitar is what carries him to absolution.<br />This album alone explains why Prince carries the influence of Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, Joni Mitchell, and James Brown unlike any other. If you don't own this recording, then consider your education of great popular music incomplete.
B000002BDB|5.0|The old addage goes that opposites attract, and in the world of music, this is, in many cases, a recipe for absolute disaster or absolute inspiration. In the case of Miles Davis and Gil Evans, only inspiration came from this.<br />The works that comprise the lps &quot;Miles Ahead,&quot; &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; &quot;Sketches of Spain,&quot; and &quot;Quiet Nights,&quot; are meshing jazz with orchestral sensibilities, with Miles' lyricism not dissimilar to Nat King Cole singing standards behind an orchestra. More than many of his jazz lps, the depth of Miles Davis is found in his ensemble playing on these recordings. The works were no easy task for him to play- demanding parts, to be sure- but Miles rose to the occasion again and again, with Evans' parts coaxing pure magic from the Man With the Horn.<br />The heretofore bootlegged unreleased tracks from Miles X-Mas songs to a session from 1968(!) are even more valuable additions to your collection and again show the breadth and depth of Miles as both a loyal friend to Evans, and as a player.<br />Amazing tracks, and an amazing collection.
B00004X01U|1.0|this is just an overhyped cd. mirwais is an overrated producer (who is not even big in france, as many may believe) and all this sounds just like french varit. very bad and very cheesy vocoder fx. there should be a law against the use of this machine. and the lyrics are so corny: &quot;hey mr dj, put a record on, i wanna dance with my baby&quot;, hello.
B0000024W3|5.0|This is a classic. It is a wonderful review of 20th century American music. A personal favorite- Days of '49. Oh my goodness...early Morning Rain another highlight. Who knew Gordon Lightfoot was such a good songwriter? Elvis did this one in his Blue Hawaii concert. A good job, but Bob's, of course, is better. Minstrel Boy, Copper Kettle...what great songs and, as another review here pointed out, if it wasn't for Dylan, we may never have heard them...

B00003CXE7|5.0|You can't talk about movies of the yar 2000 without mentioning gladiator. By far the best movie of the new millenium. Ridley Scott triumphs with this epic tale of love, hate, revenge, and war. This movie surpasses all of Scotts other movies, including Alien, in my opinion. This movie surpasses all of Scotts other movies best qualities. It has more action than Alien, more visual beauty than Legend, and more compassion than Thelma and Louise. Rusell Crowe gives an oscar worthy performance,as does Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. The visual and sound effects in this movie are beyond amazing. If you can only see one movie in 2000 see this. You will not be dissapointed at all.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I have never been much of an Elvis fan. I was drawn to his work only after his collaborations with Paul McCartney in the early 90's. In 1996 I bought EC and the Attractions &quot;All This Useless Beauty&quot; which I really liked. I had, slowly begun to collect the works of EC when this album came to be. <br />It is incredible. Every track is beautifuly done. It became an instant favorite with my wife and I. At first thought you'd think &quot;EC and who? Burt Bacharach?? No way!&quot; <br />Forget all that. It's absolutely wonderful.
B000003CMD|5.0|I enjoy the music on this album very much.  Duane Allman had been the leader of this band until his untimely death.  His brother, Gregg was left to pick up the pieces and keep the band going.  In addition, Berry Oakley died during the making of this album, appearing on only the first two tracks.  Against such adversity the band develops one of the defining albums of 1973.  Gregg Allman really does hold his own with superb playing and by contributing two great songs true to the tradition of the Blues.  JELLY, JELLY is a soulfull tune influenced by T Bone Walker and the Chicago Blues.  It is Richard &quot;Dickey&quot; Betts who really comes up with the goods by stepping forward with a bona-fide hit, RAMBLIN' MAN, and the remainder of the songs as well as playing guitar which now defines Southern Rock.  Whether he is playing Dobro in the style of the Mississippi Blues Singers on PONY BOY, or a firey lead on SOUTHBOUND, trading licks with Les Dudek while singing on RAMBLIN' MAN, it is Betts who defines the sound of this Allman Brothers' CD.  JESSICA is possibly one of the best travelling songs ever written, and it is Dickey Betts' melodic, distinctly southern guitar playing that will stick in my mind as I fondly remember this CD.  Anything else I would write would just be WASTED WORDS. If you are interested in US Southern Rock of the early seventies, or in great guitar music which is based on American Folk Blues, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|This is a good album... That is, if you're into pop music. I mean, sure this was my first Offspring album, but that was before I discovered their earlier work like &quot;Ixnay On The Hombre&quot; and &quot;Ignition&quot;.<br />Sure, a few songs on this CD are good, namely these:<br />* &quot;Americana&quot;<br />* &quot;No Brakes&quot;<br />* &quot;End Of The Line&quot;<br />* &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;<br />* &quot;Have You Ever&quot;<br />* &quot;Pay The Man&quot;.<br />Basically, the album isn't that bad, but it could have been MUCH better. &quot;Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)&quot;, &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job&quot;, and &quot;She's Got Issues&quot; are just too pop for me.
B000002J1O|4.0|The music on this CD is delightful and a joy to listen to.  The melodies are gentle, light and infectious while the lyrics are whimsical such as &quot;I am a lawn mower / You can tell me by the way I walk&quot;.  I KNOW WHAT I LIKE is such a pleasant hit whose catchy hook wears well with age.  Even the BATTLE of EPPING FOREST is no more than a child's fantasy, complete with accountants who keep score. The FIRTH OF FIFTH receives a heavy-handed treatment on the keyboards as Tony Banks seems to have forgotten which British progressive rock band he is recording with on that day.  That is an aberration, though, as from start to finish, this is a bright and airy collection of songs. THE CINEMA SHOW even has a tip of the hat to CSNY in a harmony diversion.  Every musician on this album went on to become a mainstay in British popular music: Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, especially, but even Rhett Davies, the Assistant Engineer would develop into one of the most reliable producers over the next decade.  If you are interested in progressive rock of the early seventies, or in music which contains pleasant melodies and often times, whimsical lyrics, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|The breezy rehab story of Gwen Cummings(Sandra Bullock) and her 28 days towards the road to recovery isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination, but it's definitely enjoyable.The key points to the DVD that may warrant you buying it are Betty Thomas's directors commentary, three character testimonials that were cut from the final film, instructions on how to make a gum wrapper chain like the fiesty heroine,theatrical trailers,and talent files. But the best thing, and possibly worth the price of the rest of the disc, is the hilarious 26 minutes of &quot;lost episodes&quot; of the fictional soap &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; that everyone at the rehab center watches.That alone is almost as funny as the movie, with the actors playing their scenes with intense seriousness amid ridiculous plot situations even more far fetched than the average soap.
B00003CWTI|1.0|This movie is hideous on many levels.   The unending stream of gratuitous obsenities that are mouthed by every character really dulls the impact of the words, adds nothing and makes the characters quite unsympathetic. I am sure this is part of the appeal to the teenage market. The story was dark, but ultimately childish, with it's emphasis on forced symbolism, the &quot;sins of the father&quot; theme and the phony web of &quot;interconnections&quot; that was supposed to hold our attention to the end. The loud music over the voices, and the endless motion of the camera put my nerves on on a very unpleasant edge.  After 10 minutes I was ready to stop this disaster, but I hung around to see how bad it would get - it didn't disappoint me in that regard as it plodded along with 3 hours of &quot;do you get it?&quot; cuteness. It is not surprising that 12 year old reviewers like this film, for that is where it is aimed - and that is ultimately the saddest thing about this sad, sad movie.   Kudos to ILM for the frogs; these special effects were the only interesting thing about this movie.
B00004X01U|5.0|I was disappointed by some of the narrow-minded reviews made on this CD. The music and songs are some of the best by Madonna I've ever heard. The first time I heard &quot;Music&quot; on the radio, I thought it was OK, but nothing special. I liked Madonna, and I had a couple of her CDs and the &quot;Music&quot; song just wasn't too original, I thought. But then I kept hearing it and I just liked it more and more each time I heard it and I bought the CD. &quot;Music&quot; was nothing compared to some of the other songs on the record! The lyrics were intuitive and introspective and the music itself was breath-taking and royal. I have listened to it about three times now since I got it a couple of hours ago and I'm sure it will stay in my CD player for awhile. My favorite songs were &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;, and &quot;What It's Like to be a Girl.&quot; This CD is excellent.
0743200799|5.0|I wish I hadn't been so profligate with handing out five stars in the past, because by comparison I wish I could give this book six.<br />There have been many books written about the moon landings. Most focus of course on the astronauts, with a few notable exceptions: Angle of Attack about North American Aviation and the building of the command module and Chariots for Apollo about Grumman's development of the lunar module, to name two of the best. But it took a ground controller to finally write about ground control.<br />It's a grave injustice. It's clear from these pages that the ground controllers were critical to the success of the moon landings and were among the most dedicated and hardest-working of all those involved with the space program. And that is no small compliment.<br />Gene Kranz is an almost legendary figure among these, in part due to Ed Harris's masterful portrayal of him in the movie Apollo 13. Here he gets the chance to tell his point of view. He covers his entire career-in fact, his entire life, at least in brief-and it's quite a read. He came on board the space program in the earliest days of Mercury and didn't retire until well after the moon landings. <br />We get to read about those early, tentative days, when some of the most brilliant technical minds in America came together and tried to figure out how the heck to get men into space. Initially getting a ride to the control center with astronaut Gordon Cooper, Kranz starts out with the responsibility for writing procedures for things that have never been done before. He quickly moves up the chain of responsibility and becomes a flight director in time for the Gemini missions. He covers each mission he's involved with in detail from his unique point-of-view, and continues this approach through Apollo.<br />One of the reasons I want to give this book six stars is that it's an absolute page-turner, and I can't remember the last time I read a nonfiction book that I couldn't put down. I sat upseveral nights into the wee hours, just wanting to read a little bit more to see his take on Gemini 8 (when David Scott and Neil Armstrong almost spun out of control due to a stuck thruster), Apollo 11, or Apollo 13. Even though I've read about all of these missions many, many times, it was utterly gripping to hear about them from his perspective.<br />If I were to hold anything against this book, it would be that it's clearly written by Kranz himself and not a ghost-writer. The writing is often unpolished and occasionally confusing. Still, it doesn't seem to slow the book down (see about the page-turning above), and it gives it a straightforwardness and a sometimes brutal honesty that's lacking in many more polished efforts. In particular, Kranz's account of the Apollo 1 fire and its devastating effect on all those who felt themselves in some way responsible is the most powerful recounting I've experienced, and that includes the superb dramatization in the HBO/Tom Hanks miniseries, From the Earth to the Moon.<br />He concludes the book with an impassioned plea to revitalize the American space program and recapture the spirit of the sixties, an era when, for all its troubles, anything seemed possible. As he puts it, \\"We have become a nation of spectators, unwilling to take risks or act on strong beliefs.\\" It's hard to disagree with that. And I think it's worth noting that one of the seldom-stated successes of America's space program was that it gave Gene Kranz and those who worked with him a chance to demonstrate their greatness.<br />If you have any interest in the space program at all, you MUST read this book.
0780631684|4.0|Now this is a really good horror film.In fact it is the best i've seen since the SCREAM trilogy and HALLOWEEN H20.It's got a lot of character,great death scenes(the best since OMEN) and great direction from Wong.It does have 2 major flaws though:a)the characters reaction to certain situations like e.g. their friends death when he's decapitated, is really silly and almost careless &amp; b)the humour bits are also wrongly placed and sound stupid.This movie has a far more sinister plot than SCREAM and humour has no place in it.I still give it 4 stars because it is an extremely entertaining film and i'd advice any fan of the genre to check it out.
B000002ADT|5.0|I bought this album because I have recently started listening to jazz and someone told me this is the jazz album to own and they were right. This album is simply great. Recorded on April 22, 1959 unrehearsed and in on take, this album combines the some of the greatest jazz musicians of all time in one fabulous CD. Miles is great of course, but he is joined by John Coltrane on sax, Bill Evans on piano, Cannonball on sax as well, Paul Chambers on bass, and Jimmy Cobb on drums.<br />I love this CD because it is one of the few jazz CDs I have listened to where I feel every note is rightly chosen and that it all works well together. The improvisation is great and these are truly artists who work well with each other. I highly recommend getting one of the most recent re-releases of this CD as well, many of the original audio problems have been fixed and all of the musical instruments sound a thousand times better.<br />This album is much more traditional jazz than some of Miles later stuff, which makes sense since in some ways it defines jazz. It is truly amazing that Miles was able to take jazz and play with it as he wanted, this CD sounds different in many ways than something like Birth of the Cool but they are both great. If you like this CD I would also recommend Coltrane's Love Supreme which is very similar in its flavor.<br />Overall I highly recommend this CD to anyone who wants to know what the greatest jazz artists sounded like at a time when they were performing there absolutely best.
B00004X01U|3.0|One might have expected one more albums worth of material from Madonna and producer William Orbit. After all, the two worked together to reinvigorate Madonnas' sound and produced a career defining album &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; Madonna is never content to coast on past successes. She certainly can no longer come up with ways to shock her fans and has realized she must experiment musically to keep a foot hold on her almost two decades of popularity. Hence the arrival of the uneven &quot;Music.&quot; The title track is one of Madonnas' most brilliant singles ever and pays homage to the club hits that made her a legend (ie &quot;Holiday,&quot; &quot;Get Into the Groove&quot;), however, after the third track the album slips into an ill defined and seemingly unsure direction. A lot of the tracks are over embellished with sonic bleeps and vocal distortion. &quot;Music&quot; ultimately comes off a bit self conscious versus the confident, cohesive vision of &quot;Ray of Light.&quot; &quot;Ray of Light&quot; succeeded because of its spacious arrangements. The tracks on &quot;Music&quot; are often times to dense. This is still one of the only adventurous CD's of the year and for that Madonna should be applauded and respected. I'll forever be a fan. More artists of her stature should take heed and venture out into the unknown musical landscapes like Miss Ciccone!
080018789X|5.0|Tom Cruise had a good year in 1996 showing everyone the money by starring in two of the top four grossing films of the year (&quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, $153M; and &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;, $180M).  Of the two, &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.<br />It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.<br />Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.<br />Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.<br />This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.  I recommend it highly.
6305014140|4.0|As I heard Title of the film first ... Well, there are lot of Ninja-films everywhere. The cover of the DVD spoke to me: Ninja&amp;Demon&amp;Blood. The first scene was like I thought that film would be. An arrogant unvulnerable warrior cutting bad boys in pieces. but.. Well, I noticed that one woman on the cover and thought she's the one who has to be rescued like always. I was wrong...  I think SHE plays the most important role in this film, because Jubei the ninja plays his part ... well as a ninja. Poor, lonely, serious, strong. Kajero slips out of the woman-in-ninja-film role, because of some ...facts which are quite uncommon. ;) So everyone who hasn't fear of strong women, blood, and some(three) scenes with sexual content(which I think, don't really fit to the rest of the film) can buy this DVD instantly !
B00004U3UG|2.0|The picture quality totally ruined this dvd for me. Just when you're into the film the picture goes from clear &amp; sharp into what can only be described as dirty &amp; grainy..a complete joke. I was so disturbed from what I saw that I lost my concentration through out the film, but the worst was to come in the battle scene at the end..I was almost in tears. please think twice about buying this dvd.
B000001E18|5.0|It was 1993. I went to the shop &amp; said I wanted the single of Numb by U2 &amp; in typical perversity there was no such thing, there was however a video single of it, supposedly a world 1st. So I would have to invest in a whole album, which was a big deal for a 13 year old. Numb was what grabbed me, because I had certainly heard more 'normal' U2 before, but this w/ the Edge speak-singing philosophies over thoroughly modern music &amp; falsetto chorus from Bono had become a favourite. The opener, Zooropa itself, is a real achievement, a wall of sound all lifted from commercials fades up w/ delicate piano [perhaps by Brian Eno??] before it stops for Edge's staccato guitar lick &amp; then the song takes off in epic style. Bono recites phrases often stolen from the public domain of advertising like 'Vorsprung durch Technik' [Audi cars, translates to something through technology] &amp; 'eat to get slimmer' as if they were utopian commandments in the upcoming [&amp; now quite existent] information superhighway, before it turns into a real song &amp; it's all well done. So as not to completely turn their regular rock audience away they follow it up w/ Babyface, a ballad, then back to techno-paranoia w/ Numb, followed by the falsetto vocals &amp; funk of Lemon. Stay [Faraway, So Close!] is a more typical classic U2 song although some of the themes of TV/multimedia resurface w/ &quot;you can go anywhere, Miami, New Orleans, london, Belfast &amp; Berlin&quot;, raising a smile from my family who are from Belfast. On side 2 [I recall i had the tape then the cd] we have the multilayered &amp; slightly chaotic Daddy's Gonna Pay For Yr Crashed Car w/ smart lyrics again. A similar feel is used on Some Days are better than others. The First Time, which I think is a tribute to his father, is gentle &amp; therefore the oddity of the album. Dirty Day I recall being fairly loud or distorted &amp; that the lyrics page for that had Greenpeace addresses on it, so it must have been quitepolitical. The Wanderer famously featured country crooner Johnny Cash &amp; apart from that it is a very good song. Then when you think it's over there is a hidden 30-second bullet train noise track to end it off resembling its hyperactive multilayered packaging which was something else to like about this album [completely contrasting the open spaces of Joshua Tree &amp; Unforgettable Fire &amp; good for different reasons]. This is the U2 album people who aren't even big U2 fans should get.
B000001F5F|5.0|Under A Blood Red Sky ranks as 1 of the best live albums of all time. What are the others then? I'd say Mothers Fillmore East June 1971, Hendrix @ Woodstock, Ornette Coleman Town Hall 1962. Anyway, this has the songs &amp; the great performance put in by the band who then did not have 'biggest band in the world' status &amp; the pomposity that goes w/ it. Sunday Bloody Sunday is legendary &amp; probably more well known than the War version, it goes away, the crowd claps along for it &amp; it comes back &quot;I'm so sick of it!&quot; he yells. A highlight for me is a less well known track, the full title of which is Trash, Trampoline &amp; the Party Girl which is quite sincere. Gloria &amp; New Year's Day [the album title is a lyric from it] are rather majestic &amp; brilliant. '40' reprises the refrain from SBS, &quot;how long to sing this song?&quot; in more subdued fashion to close it off. These recordings are from 3 separate shows but they blend in well. Some reviewers here complain about the brevity of it w/ only 8 tracks, well, the original red vinyl had a sticker saying mini-lp &amp; reduced price, being something between War &amp; the Unforgettable Fire which would come out later in 1984. There is a good sound here showing they were indeed a fine band [probably still are].
B000002LAB|2.0|Miles Davis was indeed a genius but this is not the work of one. This album is from 1986 &amp; all the things that made the 80s trashy are evident in it. If you were to spend an eternity in Ikea hell, this would be the soundtrack. The cover won awards because it is a good portrait of the man, but the actual contents are not so good, rather insipid, bad synth beats &amp; tweaks under solos that are uninspiring &amp; it is overall a great shame to the otherwise awesome legacy of Miles. Not even the presence of George Duke, who helped make some of Frank Zappa's funkiest music in the early to mid-70s can save this monstrosity, nor Full Nelson, the tribute to Mr Mandela, anyway the Special AKA did so earlier &amp; better. Tutu is unwelcome on the shelf next to such outstanding achievements as Kind of Blue, Jack Johnson &amp; Miles Smiles. Get those instead, they are all infinitely better [I'm sorry if I seem like the sort of critic who is just out to ruin everything, because I hate those characters as much as anyone, if I'm a snob, it just means I have good taste, which this record lacks].
B000001Y5J|4.0|ok, to start with, this is as good as Nine Inch Nails gets. If ya don't own it, it's worth buyin, sure.  Tracks 98 &amp; 99 are the best on the album, i think.  but to that other guy...call me misinformed if you like, but i've delved into everything from C-Tec to Laetherstrip and everything in between.  i know my industrial and im entitled to my opinion.  kmfdm is most definitely not cheesy, unless that's what they're going for, and in many cases it is.  i'm almost inclined to agree with you on ministry, but there's no denying they've done a lot for the genre.  as far as Skinny Puppy goes, i think remix dystemper is the best album to ease someone into their music.  again, my opinion...whatever.  Anyway, broken's listenable, buy it.  but for god's sake, reznor, quit brooding and give us more of this and stuff like 'the perfect drug' and maybe i'll consider you worthy of your predecessors.  oh, and while you're at it, people, MDFMK is as good as it gets, so download a song, an if you like it, go buy like, 20 copies of the album.  thanks fer wastin yer time on me.
B00004R7X5|5.0|The Sheherezade is awesome...and as the Penguin guide and the first reviewer point out, the violin solos are gorgeous. Karajan conducts with passion and the orchestral color is brilliant. The 1812 Overture though sounds rushed and overpolished. I enjoyed hearing the choral introduction used in this 1812, but it just lacks spirit. The cannon sounds don't quite sound like cannons either. I'm not sure what he used. Buy this CD for the Sheherezade...
0684867184|5.0|I loved the book Comrades. Even though I am an 18 year old girl, I have just started to read my teachers collection of Stephens' books, and so far, I liked them all. He told me that I might not like Comrades because it is all about male friendships. I think that it helped me figure out my male friends better.
0843178108|5.0|The person who wrote a review before used lots of fancy words, and I'm sort of worried that people might not understand what he was trying to say, so I'm going to translate: Mr. Noisy is a person who loves to be really loud, and I mean REALLY loud.  However, most people don't like being shouted at, so when Mr. Noisy talks to someone, they usually take it the wrong way.  Mr. Noisy's loud voice can cause problems, such as this: The butcher and the grocer don't like Mr. Noisy shouting all the time, so they refuse to give him his food until he quiets down.  In the end, Mr. Noisy has to learn to be quieter if he's going to get what he wants.  However, this is incredibly hard for Mr. Noisy, because it's in his nature to be noisy.
B000000WA4|5.0|This is certainly one of the best albums of all time.  Every song in this album is good.  This album is certainly better than anything the bealtles or Pink Floyd did.  The Smashing Pumpkins transfered themselves into being a great band with this album.  This album is simply an epic.  This album takes you on an emotioanl rollercoaster, similar to the emotional rollercoaster called life.  If you are into pop or boy bands or catchy tunes, then you need not buy this album.  But if you are into feeling the music you are into, then you may want to check out this album.
B00004RFFU|5.0|I truly reccomend this video for any body who is as obsessed with Vampires as I am!!<br />This movie is the best!! I have it memorized from watching it so many times!! It just brings you right into it! You feel like you are actually these characters and you want to be a part of them! You end up talking to/with the movie screen and you actually feel the same way they do!<br />I own almost every Vampire movie That I've heard of but I don't watch them as much as I watch this movie.<br />I love Brad Pitt and Tom Crusie and Kerstian Dunst so much!! They're the best!! I just can't get over the fact that I LOVE this movie!!<br />I could even recite some lines!!<br />(Scene: Claudia's Bedroom. Claudia sitting on her bed humming to herself as she draws a picture of a woman as Lestat walks in with a gift for her)<br />Claudia: Another doll? I have dosens you realize? Lestat: I just thought you could use one more! Claudia: Why always on this night? Lestat: What night? What do you mean?? Claudia: You always give me a doll on the same night of the year! Lestat: Oh, I didn't realise. Claudia: Is this my birthday? (silence) You dress me like a doll, you make my hair like a doll why? Lestat: (changing the subject) Some of these Claudia are so old, tattered. You should throw them away! Claudia: (screaming) I will then!<br />Thank-you for your time!!
6304504012|4.0|Watching the movie of Evita was my first real experience with the musical, and that puts it in a different light for me, I suppose, than with many others.  The points I make, though, I still think are valid.<br />The casting of this movie was quite good...the stars of the show pulled off their roles magnificently.  Antonio Banderas, in the lead as the narrator, Ché, sung surprisingly well.  He also acted out the part superbly.  While he's no Colm Wilkinson, there's an undeniable charm to his portrayal.  Even with the abbreviated material he's given to work with, he pulls it off with style, which says something for a role with magnificent performances by Colm and by David Essex.  He's not vocally better than either, but he plays the part to a T, and his songs seem HONEST.  Also, he's a better Ché than Mandy Patinkin, but I suppose anybody who tried to actually play the part would be.<br />Madonna is the surprise of this movie.  She sings quite well, and given the rock feel of the show, is fairly appropriate for the part of Eva Peron.  She's also visually very similar to photographs of Eva, and looks very convincing after the scenes where she is supposed to be young.  However...the point of the musical is that Eva Peron is a manipulative (rhymes with witch).  Madonna scared me here by seeming VERY sympathetic to her character.  Still, her performance is excellent, if not up to Antonio Banderas's.  Jonathan Pryce put in an outstanding performance as Peron, too.<br />A caveat emptor:  the musical was actually made less harsh for the movie version, so that it could be filmed in Argentina.  It was very nearly worth it...not entirely, mind you, and the addition of &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; seemed entirely out of place in a musical about a man and a woman who mutually USE each other.  Still, her &quot;Don't Cry for Me Argentina&quot; was manipulative to the audience just as the speech was meant to be to the crowd.  And the two Ché tours de force, &quot;Oh What a Circus&quot; and &quot;High Flying, Adored&quot; are more or less in tact, and done wonderfully.  The re-adaptation of &quot;The Lady's Got Potential&quot; was excellent, and &quot;And the Money Kept Rolling In&quot; was toned down a lot, but Banderas had a LOT of fun in the number.<br />The movie's worth seeing if you like Evita, or are thinking you might be getting into it.  Don't watch for Madonna's big numbers, watch for her and Banderas performing, for once, like they really mean it.
B00004W510|5.0|The &quot;Brown Album&quot; has to be one of the best if not the best album to appear in the sixties.  It is so ahead of it's time(or is it behind it's time?).  I defy you to find any other songs on any album at the time that sound like &quot;Across the Great Divide&quot; or &quot;Unfaithful Servant&quot;.  These songs as well as the others just pull a certain string inside me, they are so original and there is so much raw emotion in them.  While the first album, &quot;Big Pink&quot;, was a good album, it still did not fully realize The Band's music.  Big Pink still had little parts that seemed like they were trying to fit into the mainstream, but the Brown Album was completely there own.  They made one of the funkiest songs ever made with &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;, and they used the wah-wah clavinette way before Stevie Wonder's more popular &quot;Superstition&quot;.  The album also had great stories such as the Civil War epic &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, the rural drama of &quot;King Harvest&quot;, and the beautiful tale of Willy Boy in &quot;Rocking Chair&quot;.  There really is not one not-great song on the album.This album and these five talented musicians  would mold the music to come in the next thirty years with their down-home sensibilities. This is one of the few records I can listen to all the way through millions of times.  This is truly the birth of GOOD music.
0380788624|1.0|I consider Snow Crash the best cyberpunk novel ever. Diamond Age was a bit weaker but still good. After reading the others I ran out to buy this book. Cryptonomicon is much weaker than these earlier works. The pace is slow and Snow Crash has more creative ideas on one page than this whole book on 400+ pages. I ended up selling it which I almost never do. I disagree with some of the other reviewers. I'm a computer guy too (working in the networking area) but this book doesn't have much to offer to hackers or &quot;computer scientists&quot;.
6304286961|4.0|i was very impressed by this film upon my first viewing it lead to a spree of doors memorabillia crowding my home and the neighbours complaining about jims wailing on the cd player, for atleast two months this movie really affected me and turned me to music that i considered flea market hippie garbage reminiscent of an era of ridiculous hygiene and recreational excess. this film has a lot of quality out bursts and is definately one of oliver stones better films but i preferred this vision as a more desirable role only in fiction, olivers jim would be right up there with travis bickle, colonel kurtz and mickey mouse but the reality would have been hideous. the book by densmore tells a more humane tale of a man who got caught up in something only he could have laughed and smiled. stones dramatisation plays like king of kings on acid with an electric guitar.
B000002HRE|2.0|Metallica has been a favorite band of mine since I bought the Black Album. But when I bought this, I was disappointed except for &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;, the only good song on the CD. All the rest of it just doesn't sound original. I also don't like the fact that they got their haircut like the Backstreet Boys. They should have kept their hair long, kept thrashing like they did 15 years ago and not made this album such a disappointment.
0380730405|4.0|I loved this book.  I read it for a book club and put off starting it for several weeks.  One of the most interesting things the author did was to never name the main character.  It was very effective as a tool to keep her  unimportant.  She remained in the background of her own life.  She let everyone, including her husband, keep her in the dark.  By never assumming any status in her own home, and neglecting to ask even general questions of her husband's past marriage, she build a fantasy life that overshadowned her actual life.<br />When her husband finally confided in her, her reaction was not what I expected.  It was interesting how the reader is drawn in as her ally.  I look forward to reading the sequel.
0425129608|5.0|Don't go by the movie (which is not bad!)- the book is much better! Its definately in the league of her other masterpiece- Death on the Nile; those who enjoyed Death on the Nile would definately like this one (and vice- versa). I would strongly recommend this one to those who enjoy a murder in an exotic setting!
B00003Q438|5.0|This special edition shows what was cut out of the theatrical release.  I won't spoil the plot for you but suffice it to say that much of the point of the movie is different.  The documentary shows how hard it was to make this movie. If you thought you liked the theatrical release wait till you see this.
079073804X|5.0|What makes the Exorcist such an enduring film is that it is not only gut-wrenching but heart-wrenching as well. Ellen Burstyn's performance as an anguished, defeated mother desperately seeking someone to save her tortured twelve year old daughter drives this film into greatness. <br />It's easy to get caught up in the &quot;scariest movie of all time&quot; debate; but if you can get past that you'll find that the Exorcist is one of the best dramas of all time. I suspect that if Regan had suffered from cancer instead of demonic possession this film would have won many more academy awards.
B000001FXT|5.0|Bob was one of the only singer/songwriters that could sing about hardcore issues, and still keep the music brilliant and lively enough to not send his listeners into a mental depression.<br />On this, one of the Wailer's last albums(1979), Marley and the boys keep the hardcore political edge with *arresting* protest songs like &quot;Zimbabwe,&quot; &quot;Survival,&quot; &quot;Top Rankin',&quot; &quot;Babylon System,&quot; and the classic &quot;So Much Trouble In The World.&quot;<br />&quot;Marley's contageous hopeful nature is exhibited in such uplifting tunes as &quot;Africa Unite,&quot; and &quot;One Drop.&quot;<br />One of the best, and politically hard-edged albums of the late '70s for sure.<br />Marley never let the Man influence His music, and he stuck with his vision until the end.  One of the better men of the 20th century, as well as one of the better albums.
0800139151|4.0|I'm glad that there are many positive reviews on this movie, for despite its several flaws (like numerous annoying shots of the main characters' eyes staring intently at each other to enhance suspense, Ms Stone's at times blank face when it should reflect stronger emotions, some characters so bad and revolting that they make you chuckle), I've seen it for the second time and it made me grab my chair in childish excitement.<br />The plot is stark simple (see above), as well as the reasons driving the main characters to participate in the murderous contest: Ms Stone - to avenge her father, the Kid (L d Caprio) - to win his father's respect, Herod (J Hackman) - to keep townsfolk submissive and to teach his best and repented &quot;pupil&quot; Cort (R Crow) a lesson of abeyance, others - for money (but they don`t matter).<br />True, leading actors carry out the plot on their steady shoulders: * R. Crow emanates sexual charisma and suppressed prowess (long before world wide fame as macho Maximus the Gladiator) even if he spends all the movie shackled and beaten. His and Stone's sex scene is short, but oh-so-steamy! *L de Caprio is well into the shape of boyish and outside haughty/inside weak-trying-to-prove-he's-better-than-his-father,long before downpour of post-Titanic fame. * J Hackman is the perfect scoundrel,ageing scavenger, full stop. As to * Sh Stone, she remains one of the sassiest and talented actresses for me (praise her, fore she spends 2/3 of the movie rather disheveled), despite several movie flops she's participated in. She's carried her role well, with mixed feelings of despair, indifference and revulsion (at least I can't imagine any other actress in this role).<br />The end is unexpected and is not a usual annoying happy-end. What more do you need? Watch and enjoy and don't compare this movie with any earlier masterpieces. Beside Darkman (1990 w. L Niesen) it may count S Raimi's best movie so far.
0767903854|5.0|Like Bill Bryson, I am also a transplanted American.  I have read most of Bryson's book, and enjoy them immensely.  The highlight of this book (I read the English version: Down Under) is the hilarious description of Cricket using baseball references.<br />Very enjoyable, with lots of interesting trivia to keep you both laughing and thinking.
B00003CWTI|5.0|As another reviewer stated: we all have the right to our opinions, and art IS subjective. I'm not going to try to refute that, but I must throw my opinion of this movie into the mix. My friend and I both watched this movie for the second time and agreed that it only gets better after multiple viewings.<br />The tale that Mr. Andersen weaves has so many different dimensions - the complex themes and character development take time to fully comprehend. True, most of the characters in this film are dysfunctional, and the language is terrible (and this does disturb people, like my mother. I love her dearly and respect her opinion, but she hated American Beauty because it was too dysfunctional), but these negative qualities have their purpose. I walked away from the movie with the message that - yes, these things do happen. And yes, people are like this - disturbed, troubled, confused, and not entirely likable all the time. But real question is this: &quot;How do we deal with it - with life? How much can we forgive my friend?&quot; I don't know the answer to that question. True art makes you think a bit and helps you see the beauty in even the rough parts of life.<br />About the aesthetic appeal of the movie - the camera style was choppy, but for me this only contributed to the urgency of the film. The fast pace made me question what was going on and what was going to happen next. And the three hours just flew right by. Additionally, the shots of Julianne Moore in the car (looking like death itself) and Stanley looking out the window as frogs pour down outside struck me as particularly beautiful. They could hang on a wall in an art gallery. Aimee Mann's soundtrack played an integral role and helped create a definite mood. Basically, nothing was superfluous - everything contributed to the overall artistic vision and meaning of the film.<br />I could go off for ages about how much I love this movie and this director, but I've rambled long enough. Go watch it yourself; nobody else can make up your mind for you.

0385484518|5.0|Though I am the opposite of what Morrie himself would have liked in a human being, I picked up this book yesterday afternoon after hearing so much about it, and read it in no more than one and a half hours.  True, I am a quick reader, and I love to read(which is unfortunate as I have so little time for it these days), but I simply devoured the content as I laughed along and almost cried along with Morrie's situation (this is surprising, as I have not come close to crying in four years).  BUt the book touches the hearts of all, from a teenager to the most hardened investment banker.  It is most definitely a must-read, and even if it does not change your outlook on life(it didn't change mine), it teaches quite significantly, and gives lessons on life that are invaluable and priceless.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop.  Pop es un disco que es sólamente lo que nos promete, es un disco de música pop.  Pero a la vez, los genios irlandeses nos han plasmado este genero de música en una forma totalmente radical e inusual.  Generalmente cuando uno escucha la palabra pop, asocia esto inmediatamente con música intracendente, de ritmos atractivos para el oido únicamente.  Pero uno también sabe que esta siendo expuesto a un ritmo que acabará por endulzar el paladar auricular más de lo debido.  Desafortunadamente para la gente que limita la musica pop a solamente esto, los irlandeses nos prueban lo contrario acerca de este género.<br /> Podemos dividir el pop en varios subgéneros, tales como el pop balada, pop electrónico, pop rock, pop balada, entre otros.  Este disco no solamente contiene canciones que representan cada uno de estos subgéneros, sino que también alcanzan un nivel de perfección al representar a estos, que se podría llegar a tomar las canciones de este disco como definiciones para estos.  Incluso podriamos decir que el cuarteto de Dublin se mofa de los artistas que producen este tipo de música.    Desde el momento que vemos la portada de este disco sabemos que nos deparan sonidos y ritmos totalmente diferentes a lo que hemos escuchado de esta banda en el pasado, pero igualmente hay ciertas conecciones y reminiciencias de este mismo pasado.  La portada de este disco nos da una imagen sencilla, pero a la vez alterada electrónicamente por filtros computacionales, tal como la muscia que lleva dentro.  Los resultados de estas infiltraciónes de lo electronico y la sencillez hacia la música de U2 simplemente resultan en una genialidad que solamente podría definirse como el verdadero pop.<br /> Con las canciones Discothéque, Do You Feel Loved, y Mofo  podemos ver el aspecto del pop electrónico en este disco.  Cada una de estas canciones lleva con ellas un excelente uso y mezcla de sintetizadores, guitarras, y la voz inconfundible del vocalista Bono.  El ritmode la guitarra de The Edge, combinado con la voz y los sonidos creados por la voz de Bono combinan en estas canciones para crear una digna represenacion de lo que es la música electrónica de hoy, algo que muchos críticos pensaban que U2 jamás podría lograr.  Muchos criticaron la intención de estos por crear un album que fuera de ritmos totalmente pop.  La gente creyó que U2 finalmente había caido a las manos de los promotores ambiciosos y a un mercado eternamente creciente para la música de `usesé y tírese.'  Una vez mas nos han dejado sin palabras para argumentarles en su contra.<br /> Vemos en If God Would Send his Angels, Staring at the sun y Last Night on Earth,  una mezcla entre el U2 de antaño y esta nueva versión del grupo.  Estas canciones nos recuerdan de los ritmos que tocaban al final de la decada de los ochentas pero al igual se le implementó a estas un pequeño toque de los noventas.  La letra de If God Would Send his Angels tiene una faceta religiosa, algo muy común en la música de los irlandeses, ya que Bono, Larry Mullen Jr. y The Edge son sequidores fervientes del cristianismo.  La canción pide que los angeles vengan y nos ayuden a recuperar y restaurar este mundo que estamos perdiendo y devastando.  Esto se puede relacionar directamente con el espiritu de este grupo, ya que ellos son eternos contribuyentes a fondos de beneficio social y cultural.  <br /> Con esto, y mucho más el grupo que alguna vez fue duramente criticado por su incursión al género pop, nos contradice una vez mas.  Este material discográfico explaya las virtudes musicales de estos genios dublinenses variando desde la gutarra eléctrica de The Edge, hasta los excelentes effectos de percusión concebidos por Adam Clayton.  Esto aunado a una pequeña inclusión de previos ritmos y letras extrañamente conmovedoras nos plasma una nueva idea de lo que es el verdadero pop. El verdadero pop es el pop de U2.
0881032565|5.0|The book Then There Were None is an extremely good book.  It starts out with ten strangers on an island with an unknown host.  Then, they start being killed one by one.  It all comes together at the end.  This was one of the best books I have ever read.  The beginning is hard to follow, but the end is very intense.
B00000099Y|5.0|I have never heard anything like Tool.<br />I downloaded and listened to several songs off this album.  Within a day I have come to the conclusion that this is the one album I simply HAVE to OWN.  So now I do.<br />Unbelievable and undescribable are the words that come to mind!
0345349571|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. This book is the proof that, when well written, true story can be more interesting than fiction. Witty, entertaining and sometimes sarcastic.There is far more beyond the story of the Sire de Coucy, the central character of the book. The book offers a very close look at Medieval Europe and one cannot escape a thought that it also offers a look at the world around us today. As we are lead through the Middle Ages we realize that human nature has not changed.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Chili Peppers have really become individuals in the most literal sense of the word- you try to compare them to someone, and you come up with &quot;.....Uh?&quot; Their sound is very unique, but describing it is far too difficult. Instead, I'll sum up my favorite songs.<br />Scar Tissue- This song is so beautiful. The lyrics are fun, and the guitar line is really sweet and soft. Otherside- One of the harder songs on the albums, Otherside is an absoutle gem of a song. Anthony Kiedis sounds really excellent. Californication- This song is terrific, but it really has a very haunting message. Unlike most RHCP songs, the message here is easy to decipher. I think I'll let you do it yourself. Emit Remus (I think)- This song is just fun- it's got a bood beat and an interesting story. I think it might be my favorite. Porcelain- However, this song beats it. Porcelain is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It has a hauntingly beautiful melody. Purple Stain- Although the lyrics are a bit immensely west of center, the song has a great beat with a very catchy chorus.
B00003CXCD|5.0|This movie strs Audrey Hepburn(Princess Ann), Gregory Peck(Joe the reporter), and Eddie Albert(Photographer).  Audrey plays the part of a princess who wants her freedom at least for one night.  And she gets it.  She runs around the streets of Rome and runs into Joe(Gregory Peck) who takes care of her.  Until he realizes she is the Princess.  Many escapades are setup for Eddie Albert(Photographer) to take pictures of the princess.  In the end she realizes this cannot go on forever so she goes back to the palace.  There is a very touching scene when the boy loses his princess, he realizes that love is stronger than a news story.  In my opinion this is one of the best films ever filmed.  Audrey Hepburn is a real life Princess.
6305903182|3.0|This is the worst scream movie. To all the people out there who say it was good what was story line whats the meaning?
B000002J1I|4.0|»Tormato« is 'the Yes album which falls outside of the other Yes albums'. A lot of Yes fans consider it the worst Yes album ever. That's a shame. 'Cause »Tormato« is in fact a(nother) great Yes album, although a little unusual.<br />It is more joyful than most Yes stuff, and the lyrics are more comprehensible/easily-accessible - even in a 'serious' song like »Don't Kill The Whale«. The album starts out in a great way with the twin tracks »Future Times«/»Rejoice«. Jon Anderson's voice comes through very clearly and very happily, and so does the keyboards. In general, the keyboards with its unmistakable late-1970s synth sound are in the foreground on »Tormato«.<br />Among the more boring tracks are »Circus Of Heaven« and »Arriving UFO«. A lot of people have given the latter the title 'worst Yes song ever' - but it really is not that bad!<br />A masterpiece on this underrated album is »On The Silent Wings Of Freedom«.<br />So - drop your prejudice, stop throwing tomatoes, and go for »Tormato«!
6305558167|5.0|I love movies like this that shows the ages of knighthood.I think it was done as best as anyone could of hoped for. I have seen the VHS and DVD versions and own them both. If you like the classic tales of the past, You will love this one. I gave it 5 stars due to the way it makes you feel throughout the entire movie. THUMBS UP !!!!
0881032565|4.0|Over the summer, I was required to read one of three books.  I chose And Then There Were None since it grabbed my attention.  The story kept me reading, and I often found myself reading it for hours at a time.  Agatha Christie made this book seem real, like I was in the story.  The beginning was a little slow, but after the first few chapters were through, the plot came alive.  Ten mysterious murderers were brought to Indian Island by a mysterious host.  Then, all of them die, one by one.  Be sure to read the epilogue so you can find out who the killer is!
0808581945|5.0|I've read &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; about 5 times now, and I'm yet to find a book with such great use of language as Anthony Burgess has done here.  The tale of neighborhood punks that drink milk laced with drugs, and go into the night (&quot;Shopcrasting&quot; as Alex DeLarge says)raping, brutally abusing, and even killing people.  This is a great outlook onto the future that Mr. Burgess has done with this novel.  I would recommend this novel to anyone over the age of 13, because of the extreme violence.
0451160916|5.0|Re-reading this book recently was like reading a different author.  I've read everything Stephen King has written, and have read most of it several times.  Sometimes it takes awhile to get back to an earlier work, but you can immediately tell a difference.  The writing flows so well in this novel.  It is just so good, almost better than anything he has ever done.  I can't see it being written in a 'rush', it seems so deliberate and calculated.<br />One of King's greatest strengths is his characters, and although in this work there are only three main players for most of its length, you don't become bored with any of them.  Jack, Wendy and Danny are so well-drawn, in the past as well as the present, that you feel you really know them.  Danny especially is one of my favorite characters.  King does such a good job bringing a 5-year-old boy to life.  He seems to really have a talent for creating children on page.  After reading it, I kept wondering what Danny is doing now.  What a silly thought for a fictional character, but it happened.<br />This book is truly scary.  It's done slowly, bringing you closer and closer to the impending doom.  I had to put it down at night. You can read it again and again and still the fear does not diminish.  I've stayed at a hotel where looking down the long hallway, I could think of nothing but the Overlook.  Truly a creepy feeling.<br />I think King's earlier works were his best and scariest.  Nothing he has done in the past fifteen years can live up to this.
B00004TDRD|5.0|Jaws. Just hearing that word, that one word, is enough to remind me of what is surely one of Spielburg's greatest films, if not his finest film. Surely everyone has heard of this film, but if you have not, or if you need a memory refresh, this excellent film follows the story of three men-the chief of police, Martin Brody...the oceanographer, Matt Hooper...and the salty sea cap'n Quint-as they try to hunt down the ocean's greatest predator, a fish which is billed as an 'unstoppable...eating machine...' There are more memorable scenes than can be recounted, and the film is so well put together that there are several times chills will be sent up your spine, multiplied by the excellent score of one John Williams. I have watched it again and again, and this new release only makes it better, adding behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and more. Get it now. And see it, before you go swimming.
0201485672|3.0|Be warned: the examples in this book are all written in Java! As a C++ programmer I was very disappointed when I saw that (when I got the book!) IMHO, you should NOT write large applications in Java and therefore you would not need to refactor your code very often. C++ on the other hand is NOT suited for small programs (too cumbersome to just get off the ground, but THEN...) and you'd probably NEED to refactor your programs on a regular basis. The ideas in the book are good and valid, the chosen language is WRONG (IMHO)
B0000214F3|4.0|A lavish remake of the 1971 television production of Death Takes a Holiday which in turn was a remake of the 1934 movie of the same name by Maxwell Anderson and Gladys Lehman in which Frederick March plays the Brad Pitt role of Death Incarnate. It features some wonderful acting particularily by Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs) as the father, Claire Forlani (Mall Rats) as the favorite daughter, Marcia Gay Harden (Millers Crossing) as the less favorite daughter who knows it and Jeffrey Tambor (Girl Interrupted) as a son-in-law. In the face of each of our own deaths, what is important in life? That is the question this movie considers, but to me, the relationships between the father and the two daughters are what makes this movie transcend the ordinary Hollywood film. Somehow Hopkins, Harden and Forlani, particularily, manifest their deep love for each other. Directed by Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Beverly Hills Cop) with a good score by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption)
B000002KBH|5.0|What else can be said about this album? Because the album is worth listening to over and over, so is reading, writting and talking about it. The vocals on Attics of my Life are the best the dead ever produced on any album. They are perfect. All the songs are  expertly written and performed. Ripple is one of the best true- blue american folk song ever written. The melody meshes perfectly with the words which gives the feeling of optimisim,hope and pure happiness. The song Till the Morning Comes never made it into the regular concert rotation, is a excellent rendition. The sound is joyful and very peppy. Box of Rain is song written by Robert Hunter and Phil Lesh which was wriiten at the time of Lesh's farther dying of cancer. As a matter of fact, Garcia's mother and Bob Weir's Parents had also passed away at the time. All the emotion and passion for life were put into this album. This is the &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; of recordings in american folk music, not just for the Grateul Dead. Other songs of note are Candyman and Friend of a Devil. Again, Garcia sings beautifully. His voice is young,fresh, and full of heartfelt passion. This album is not at all like the live concerts the band was playing at the time. Some  shows had acustic sets but the electric sets were like entering a war zone of Fire Breathing Dragons.  The sound on American Beauty is rich, warm and very inviting.  This is a testiment to the incrediable versitility of this remarkable band of very fine musicians. Special note goes to David Grisman and Howard Wales for adding texture with mandolin and keyboards respectivly.
6305807086|4.0|The thing about BJM is that for a wierd movie the plot holds together right through to the end.  Sometimes something Avant Garde like this gets so wrapped up in being wierd that when the credits roll you are surprised.  Not this movie - it has book ends.<br />There are some really funny moments in this movie.  There is a spoof on corporate videos that is fabulous, including a non-PC reference to midgets as &quot;accursed&quot;!  There are surealistic moments that have the edge of wierdness made easier to handle by subltle comedy.  John Malkovitch is actually quite good at having a sense of humor.  He depicts his own life as rather boring and mundane - you almost wonder why anyone would care to be him - he leads a life no more interesting than anyone elses.  However it gets interesting because of interference from the principle characters, so in a sense no one gets to be John Malkovitch because the act of observing his life changes it.<br />One of the major themes in the movie is puppeteering. The puppet work in BJM is fantastic.  I think it is one of the great little surprises of the movie and really enhances the enjoyment.<br />Overall this is a fabulous movie.
B000002OZY|5.0|Simply one of the finest works in the rock genre. Radical in its own time, Tommy still is a complete work that flows from song to song and tells a story which is allegorical in nature. After so many years, it still can hold its own. A must for anyone trying to put the history of rock and roll into some sort of perspective
B00000JCB2|1.0|Fred Durst is nothing more than an talentless ape.  How did he ever get involved in music?  Who was the sucker thattook him seriously?   This band is a laughingstock.  If you want to make your parents mad, go ahead and give these idiots your money.  If you want to hear a hard-rocking band with talent, try Primus or Korn.
B00004X01U|1.0|Sorry, but Celine Dion is a much better singer, the last song in which she was trying to sing in french may be she have heard Celine singing in her native french and wanted to copy her. Celine sings the good french though, not no syllable by syllable sing along. and I recommend her album anyday than tacky madonna. Lets start by criticising the songs. The first one is what you say....Je ne se quoi. Oh baby you should have heard Celine intonation in french to compare. Ok then , the next, Madonna must know she cant compare with the real diva Celine. I think she tries to copy her in the emotives , but it dont come through, sorry madonna. I hate to say it but the seemingly crayon color picture on cover. Its too brite and shiny. Now back to the music, put it this way, shes no Celine and cant ever ever ever profess to be!
B000002UJQ|3.0|It's late, I'm tired and not capable of writing a big review....but suffice it to say that a) I think this is an album people should buy and b) I say that for the first 6 songs which to me are incredible.....what happened to the second half of the record????
B00004W5UA|5.0|This movie did not look appealing to me when it first came out. Brad Pitt going around beating up people? Wow, that sounds fun! But because I'm a huge fan of Edward Norton I went ahead and bought this film. It was nothing like I expected at all.<br />To start off Edward Norton is an unnamed man who has insomnia, to fall asleep he goes to support groups where he meets a man named Bob (played wonderfully by Meat Loaf), going to these support groups helps him sleep and makes him feel better about his life. Everything is going well until a &quot;tourist&quot; to this groups comes in and shatters everything, this girl (played oddly by Helena Bonham Carter) and Edward Norton make a deal so they can share their support groups. All is going well untill Edward Norton meets a man named Tyler (played by Brad Pitt) a soapmaker, on a plane. After getting off of the plane Edward finds his bags gone and goes home to his apartment to find it blown up. The only person he has to turn to is Tyler, the man he met in the plane. After meeting up with Tyler, he stays at his Tyler's house and they start up a group that fights so they can get their tension out...hence... FIGHT CLUB!<br />This movie is very freaky, very funny, very violence, very provocitive, and very good. This movie reminds me of a Stanley Kubrick film. Edward Norton of course, is great as always. The end just freaks you out and leaves your jaw hanging. This is surely one of the most startiling films I've ever seen. It just literally blows you away. I simply couldn't believe it. I've never, and will never probably ever see anything like it. This is going to be a cult film, I'm pretty sure. Also in years from now I believe it'll be a overlooked classic.
B0000248L1|5.0|This is one of the best trash-metal albums of all time. The first thing that blew me away was the amazing skills of Jeff Waters on the guitar, I was absolutely impressed by the speed, the rhythms and the solos of Jeff.... this album is a clasic of metal and has some of the finest songs that I've ever heard... listen to 'Crystal ann' (This acoustic masterpiece is one of the best intros I've ever heard) , 'Alison Hell', 'WTYD'  and you'll know what i'm talking about .... the psychotic melodies and the speed of 'Human Insecticide' (faster impossible) and 'Schizos Are Never Alone' will drive you crazy ... a MUST-HAVE!!!!
6300216748|4.0|I first saw this movie when it was released in 1975. I was seven years old and it had me on the edge of my seat. Twenty - five years later it still moves along. It's aged very easily. Redford does an excellent job as a man who has no experience, or training, as a field operative. All he has going for him is his intelligence and the fact that he reads spy novels and murder mysteries for a living.He makes mistakes, but he also makes several brilliant moves that a sesoned operative would never consider, which is one reason why he survives. His actions seem believable. He's an ordinary man having to cope with an extraordinary situation. Max von Sydow and Cliff Robertson are also very good and though it is a small part John Houseman shines as one of the grand old men of the CIA. Though the technology has aged, as well as some of the field techniques ,much of it is still very relevant as is the motivation for wiping out Condor's entire department. It actually is a nice little twist when the truth is revealed. This is truely a classic espionge thriller. Though I enjoy the Bond movies 3 Days of the Condor belongs under the realistic category.In my opinion it leaves Tom Clancy and Jack Ryan in the dirt.
B0000248L0|5.0|Following the wave of its predecessor (Alice In Hell) the second album of Annihilator is just another masterpiece. The main difference is that this one is more melodic, but it still absolutely heavy and aggresive... especially in 'Phantasmagoria' and 'I Am In command'....  The guitar skills of Jeff Waters will blow you away, while the previous album was more rhythm-oriented, this album has possibly the best guitar solos and melodies I've ever heard.... &quot;Alice In Hell&quot; and &quot;Never Neverland&quot; are with no doubt included on my all-time top 10 metal albums and are far better than any album of Slayer or Megadeth
0881032565|5.0|The Book that I read, by force, actually turned out being a very good book. There are many reasons why this Agatha Christie novel was so great. Perhaps the most significant reason is the desire to know what is going to happen next.  The book is about ten people who are invited to a weekend of fun by an anonymous guest. One by on they are eliminated until there becomes no guests left and a note from the mad host.  This novel was actually HARD to stop reading. All the clues intrigued me to read on. For example, when the characters arrived to an unoccupied mansion you had to figure that something was going on. And as the amount of people on the island decreased the suspicion increased. This book was great from the start to finish -- from the invitation letters signed, \\"UNKNOWN\\" to the final intrigue of the last few deaths of the last remaining guests. If you can get your hands on it definitely read this book. It is great for those who like suspense. Agatha Christie is a great author who does a great job with mystery novels and this is perhaps her best work
B00004SCX6|3.0|If there is one word to describe this album it has to be: dissappointing. I got the cd the first day it was released. I was sooo excited! I listened to it constantly, yet I skipped a ton of the songs. I really liked the song &quot;Lucky&quot;, it reminds me a lot of her 1st cd, which i loved. I also liked the song &quot;Where Are You Now.&quot; But others on the cd though, such as &quot;Satisfaction&quot;, and &quot;Stronger&quot; are absolutely pathetic. If you are a big fan of mainstream pop though, get this cd.
B00004Z4UW|5.0|If the movie is excellent, just guess how good the special will be, look at it in perspective, The Matrix on VHS was great in itself. Now add tons and tons of extras and you get the limited edition PLATINUM version. Now, I have the The Matrix on VHS and the tape is starting to wear out because of the obsessive viewing! Now i will try not to scratch this beauty up, OK!<br />BUY IT BUY IT!
0380789019|4.0|Although I expected this book to be a devolved version of Gaiman's marvellous &quot;Sandman&quot; world, I was delighted to find a completely different story. All the Gaiman hallmarks were there - elaborate but satisfyingly logical mythology, flashes of hilarity, voracious evil and stumbling, frightened good - but the secrets of London Below were thrilling and almost always unexpected. The bad guys were gruesome, the good guys self-interested, and the division engrossingly unclear. Richard Mayhew, the Everyman and our guide to London below, was far less irritating than his role would suggest, and Gaiman managed to avoid the trap of having the locals explain everything to the reader through Richard, though sometimes only barely. The few times that Gaiman's vision faltered were, unfortunately, very obvious, and these few clunky moments tended to occur at moments that should have been climactic rather than annoying.  Gaiman's fantastical London and its ragtag denizens are the real attraction of this book, and the occasionally laboured plot is a small price to pay for the visit.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|After years of waiting Björk finally sings again. Her last LP Homogenic was an emotional journey through friendship, love, lust and dispair. Now Three years later SelmaSongs arrives. It contains seven songs including one instrumental. At first glance it might seem short and small, but you shouldn't be fooled. <br />Since this is a soundtrack to the musical Dancer In The Dark, it gains a lot if you have seen the movie. Then your emotions are allredy set for whst is to come. The movie is GREAT by the way. <br />After the first listen i felt like I had been swept away by something i couldn't describe. And with every listen the songs grow until they feel universal. The songs are dark end emotional, if you've seen the movie you'll understand. The lyrics are claustrofobic, what about &quot;If living is seeing, I'm holding my breath&quot; My personal favourites are the catchy Cvalda, the sad I've Seen It All, the even sadder Scatterheart and New World which is just Wonderfull. I love this record and will cherish it together with my other Björk albums.
0792842723|5.0|James Bond is by far the one of the best movie franchises in history. And unarguably the most successful. All this coming from a Star Wars fan. Yeah, Star Wars is great, but would it be as successful as Bond after 19 films? I'm not sure. But after Timothy Dalton's poor display as Bond, I was beginning to move away from 007. However, the birth of a new 007, a better 007, soon changed my mind.<br />I watched Goldeneye, Pierce Brosnan's first attempt at the legendary agent, and I saw something I had never seen before. Bond was back, and better than ever. He had now made me a believer that someone could play Bond, James Bond better than Roger Moore. Pierce Brosnan did a terrific job, and soon, I was playing the video game based on the movie, trying to be like him as much as possible.<br />Was it the plot? No, I don't think so. I actually believe that Goldeneye has one of the weaker plots in the Bond series. The idea of satellites taking out entire cities doesn't seem like a Bond mission, but what're you gonna do? However, with 006 as his enemy in the film, it actually gave him an enemy that made me say, &quot;He could kill James.&quot; We've seen enemies in the past that just couldn't cut it. Take Goldfinger for example. You knew he couldn't take out James, so he had Oddjob. Or Drax in Moonraker. He couldn't kill Bond either, so he had Jaws try for him. But now there was an enemy that could actually hold his ground and fight 007, not have some other guy do it for him. That really excited me. Good call on that one. <br />Second, I think that having Natalyia fight back a little, like when she knew how to use a gun and could really destory Boris if she had the chance, was a nice touch. I've seen Bond girls that were harmless....but don't take me wrong and try to get rid of 'em. That would be fatal for all us guy 007 fans. But it was nice to have someone actually helping Bond out a little, even though he wouldn't need her held in the first place.<br />This was a great movie, and in my opinion, the best 007 movie to date. Although a little disappointed with Tomorrow Never dies and the wimpy bad guy in Elliot Carver, Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond ever. And he proved it when I was The World Is Not Enough opening day. You can tell that he finally feels comfortable playing 007, and in only three films. It took Roger Moore and Sean Connery at least five before they were completely believable. And that is just one more reason to see Goldeneye. Great action, great acting, great film. (The end battle between James and Alec is the best! I won't tell you who wins, but considering there have been two more films since, you should figure that one out with no problem.)
B00003CWTI|3.0|After an outstanding debut with &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; P.T. Anderson left me a little flat with this followup.  With &quot;Magnolia&quot; he seems obsessed with something he started in &quot;Nights:&quot; following the individual lives of his characters.  The problem is that where in &quot;Nights&quot; we see how they are all connected from the beginning and all action for several years is put into motion by one event (the arrival of Eddie/Dirk), &quot;Magnolia&quot; follows a 24 hour period of a group of people, all of whom are connected through one character, some of them tenuously or second or third hand.  We do not get a chance to really identify with any characters, or sympathize with many of them.  A sudden, out-of-nowhere plot twist affects them all within the last 15 minutes, a conceit Anderson should not have needed.  It seems like Anderson came in with a concept (the many lives flowering out from one person's life like a Magnolia; almost an &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; from everyone else's point-of-view) and a theme (&quot;these things happen,&quot; as one character says) but seems to have sacrificed an overarching plot to them.  This film has more in common with Richard Linklater's &quot;Slacker&quot; than it does with &quot;Boogie Nights,&quot; so if you liked the former and not the latter, you might want to give this film a try.  If you liked the latter and not the former, give it a pass.
B00004X0Q0|3.0|The hype machine revving up for this El Paso quintet is nearly as deafening as the frantic rock these guys crank out.  They're passionate, so comparisons are often made to Rage Against the Machine and Fugazi.  Those are apt, but more to the point would be Shudder to Think and Gang of 4.  The songs on Relationship of Command are like hectoring seizures; they keep you shaking when you'd much rather stop.  The lyrics don't help - obscure and pretentious, occasionally hitting a powerful image they chant into the ground.  Singer Cedric has a forceful set of pipes; the band is so tight it squeaks.  They might be a force to reckon with when they calm down enough to focus.
B00004XPQ2|5.0|This is my favorite film of all time.  I've seen it many, many times but could see it again at the drop of a hat.  It is flawlessly made technically (as you would expect from perfectionist Lean).  But there's an underlying question here that I've never quite figured out and maybe that's why I keep coming back to it.  The question has to do with Colonel Nicholson's motives.  Why didn't he realize until the very end (&quot;What have I done?&quot;) that he was helping the enemy?  Alec Guinness thought he was insane.  I'm left wondering if the film's point is that making war is at odds with the natural inclinations of the human spirit.  This is one of the few films that I can call &quot;must-see&quot;.
B00003CXDG|3.0|Cool motorcycle scene, and a few other bits.  Overall - predictable and kinda silly
B00002E23E|5.0|What can I say? This film was done in 1976 so visual editing was still,well, 1976 era type of editing. It's almost watching a home movie. Dont expect bright, crisp scenes. You'll realize this film has a ton of bugs as far as movie editing is concerned. Focus more on the music that these guys wrote and played. That's what this film is all about--- the music.<br />The only sad note to this film for me is that I will never get to see John Bonham play again. He was to me the greatest rock drummer --- all time
0792842731|4.0|This film isn't good enough to be called great. It isn't bad enough to be called just okay. It's just in between, so I gave it 4 stars. Why? Well, after being so impressed with Goldeneye, I was expecting an even better follow up, but after saying how great an enemy 006 was, they gave me another loser bad guy. Who is Elliot Carver anyway? A millionaire who can't do anything but whine and complain. He needs Stamper, his sidekick, to do the work for him. Does this look like another movie I've seen before? How about nearly every James Bond film! I was really getting sick of the bad guys that couldn't fight back until 006 walked onto the scene, but he's dead and gone now. So we're forced to settle with the same ole bad guys.<br />But it's James Bond, really. I love them all in some way, and like the rest, I do like the film. For the first time we really got to see a good chase in his BMW, unlike Goldeneye where he uses it for all of two minutes at the most. That was a good thing to see. And the action was still top notch. And the plot was better than Goldeneye too, so who am I to complain? It was a good movie, and despite it's loser villian in Carver, Brosnan played 007 better in Goldeneye's sequel. Seeing him stop Carver from starting World War III was a great plot, but if Carver could actually fight back a little.....well, that would've been helpful. <br />In conclusion, if you liked Goldeneye at all, you'll probably be slightly disappointed with Tomorrow Never Dies. But it's not all that bad. In fact, it's still pretty good. Just think of it this way: if you actually sat through Timothy Dalton's Bond films, this will be heaven.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is brilliant.  You are first introduced to a Mr. Narrator (Edward Norton), who is living his job, suffering insomnia, and crazed about IKEA furniture.<br />After becoming conscious of this constrictive lifestyle he constantly questions himself.  This questioning reaches out to many philosophical concepts, and alludes to many questionably sane people.  Finally, after curing his insomnia with group therapy for conditions which he himself has none of, he meets Helena Bonham Carter, a fellow group therapy faker.  Her role is that of a chain smoking suicidal sex crazed lunatic, it is at this point that Norton's character reaches the boundaries of his subconscious.<br />What follows is the battle between Edward Norton and his subconscious, with Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden along for the ride and bringing an organized method to this madness; Fight Club.  Fighting society, this group attempts to create a segue for the blue collar, white collar, run of the mill every day workers trapped in a routine lifestyle just like Edward Norton's character.  Growing to national proportions, Norton eventually finds himself overwhelmed, shocked and confused by some of the deeds the group has graduated into doing.<br />The DVD version of this movie aesthetically perfect.  The transitions are second to none, everything is very clean.  The supplemental disc contains scenes that were, unbelievably so, too gruesome or questionable for the final cut.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it while your waiting for your order to arrive.  Some might like the think the world will eventually benefit from this movies ideals and gratuitous concepts.
1558807381|5.0|This delightful film is universally lambasted by critics--heaven forbid people enjoy a movie about sweetness and good triumphing over evil! Especially one that has a plot that I can follow on the first viewing! Well, phooey to them! This movie is a creative masterpiece.<br />In the fairy-tale land of Not-Named, Mia Sara plays the innocent princess Lily, who spends her time romping in the woods with the forest boy Jack, played by Tom Cruise. Meanwhile, in the pits of a hellish dark castle, Tim Curry plays the demonic devil Darkness, who seeks to shroud the world in eternal night and rule over it. But he is prevented from doing so because of a pair of unicorns keep the world stable.<br />So he has his goblins (yecch, they're disgusting!) follow Lily and Jack to where the unicorns are playing, and then manages to hack off the horn of one of them. Lily has been captured, and Jack is left in a hellish winter wasteland, feeling guilty. He teams up with a bunch of elven creatures and fairies to rescue Lily and--of course--save the world. The end scenes are simply stunning.<br />Okay, so the dialogue is as cheesy as bad parmesan. So Tom Cruise doesn't wear pants in a blizzard. So Tim Curry is wearing fake muscles and giant horns. So what? All of the elaborately delightful sets, the dialogue, the showers of petals/snow/other--it's all wonderful! All of it fits with the misty plotline and love of beauty that the director CLEARLY had.<br />You can only enjoy this movie if you don't expect an intellectual experience, sort of like watching &quot;Princess Bride&quot; or &quot;Star Wars.&quot;<br />There's minimal violence and no sex or nudity (except a REALLY plunging neckline that Lily wears at one point), but some scary things are so well-done that they might well scare your kids silly: Tim Curry, despite his suave evilness that kicks all Disney villains around, might scare them with his booming voice and devil-physique; the hideous swamp-hag; the zombie-things; the writhing half-dead human; and the endless parade of hideous goblins.<br />However, if your kids can handle the ickier parts, this is a better-than-average movie for them to watch--good triumphing over evil may sound trite, but this movie makes it beautiful.lf-dead human; and the endless parade of hideous goblins.<br />However, if your kids can handle the ickier parts, this is a better-than-average movie for them to watch--good triumphing over evil may sound trite, but this movie makes it beautiful.
B00003W8NM|5.0|First off the DVD is cram-packed with so much it should make any collector grab it. About the film itself, this has shown me that Hollywood can occasionally let out a masterpiece when it stops thinking about demographics and being 'politically correct' (or modern censorship). This film is gorgeously shot and lighted, the production values are stellar. I am always impressed with directors who use film as a visual art rather than just sticking a camera on actors. The dilapidated world of Fight Club is both repulsive and attractive, mirroring the moral decay of our world today. The cast is well-chosen, extremely subtle and natural. The script is magnificent, light and thoughtful. It brings across its ideas in a funny way and avoids dwelling and preaching. It explores many of the same themes and issues that were brought up in American Beauty, but in a far more risky manner. From the trailer  I had no idea this film is a comedy, a very funny film (my idea of a comedy is a strong story with some really funny moments, NOT a string of punch-lines and gags and schlock like you get from awful Adam Sandler, etc.) with some serious ideas. The world of yuppies living their vacuous lives, pursuing the almighty dollar and bragging about their boring SUVs (come on, they're just pickup trucks!) and stock portfolios is one I've long been tired of. Whatever happened to being human? To experiencing genuine feelings? To reaching out and connecting with others? This film asks those questions and cautions us by showing how someone leaping out of the shallow yuppy life might easily swing too far the other way. Yes there is a degree of violence but, as Edward Norton mentions in the commentary, it is not senseless video-game violence like you find in inferior juvenile films like The Matrix, etc. The violence in this film shows us just how far one man might travel in his life to find some sort of meaning that has been buried under the media's messages of 'buy and spend', 'look and act like everyone else by following these ads', etc. After the film I remembered the humor and the ideas, not the violence. If you are open-minded, tired of the usual Hollywood rubbish, view films as more than soulless entertainment, enjoy being your own person, like thinking and exposing yourself to ideas, then I can strongly recommend this to you. If you are close-minded, a yuppy, someone who moved to the suburbs because you don't feel comfortable around different people, actually like the new VW bug, think that money tells a person's worth, got married because everyone else did, follow fashion from ads rather than developing your own style, then watch this and try to learn that life is more than a string of possessions, trends and friends who accept you because you look like they do. If the money-obsessed lawyers who run Hollywood really want to make money, they should concentrate on making more films like this:  Edgy, thoughtful, cautionary, funny and made with real quality and care.
0805062971|5.0|What is Fight Club? Fight Club is a ride through the life of an unsatisfied man that is only looking for a way out. The only solice he finds is through self-destruction and the destruction of others. He finds freedom in pain.<br />With the help of Tyler Durden, he organizes that pain. He gets a predictable dose of his own personal Nirvana. Through chaos he orders his own life -- or does he?<br />So is this exactly the squeekiest clean of books for the ultra-conservative? No, it's more a book for the person that think they can't take any more. This book shows you what rock bottom really is. If you're in for a book that you certifiably can't put down, grab yourself a copy of Fight Club.
0393317552|5.0|Unlike most of the \\"history\\" we were force-fed in school, \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is at once thought-provoking, well-written, fascinating, and highly entertaining.  Jared Diamond richly deserves all the accolades (and money), which he has earned!  Hey, anyone who can make history interesting to millions of Americans raised on a thin gruel of rote memorization, boring textbooks, and self-serving propaganda (see James Loewen's \\"Lies My Teacher Told Me\\") has got to be doing something right!<br />As far as the critics of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" at least as indicated by reviews here at Amazon.com, they basically seem to be arguing that the book is flawed because it is (choose one or more): \\"politically correct,\\" \\"left-wing,\\" not \\"original,\\" \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" overly deterministic in its focus on natural forces/factors, and -- a related criticism - neglectful of important \\"human variables,\\" particularly \\"culture\\" and \\"religion.\\"  <br />OK, then, what about it, is the book \\"politically correct\\" or \\"left-wing\\"?  Well, if by \\"politically correct\\" the critics are referring to a hypersensitivity to any criticism of the \\"in\\" group(s) of the day, and/or holding the majority (or an \\"out\\" group, like white males, in some people's view) to a far tougher standard than others are held to, I don't really see how that criticism applies to \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\".  Reason?  Diamond is not saying that Europeans are BAD because they conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever, he's just explaining WHY Europeans conquered the Indians or Africans or whoever.  Huge difference there!   Really, it's surprising that this book is criticized as \\"PC\\", because as far as I can tell it's basically arguing \\"survival of the fittest\\" on a racial level (although not for any \\"inherent\\" or \\"God-given\\" reason, but basically for totally natural/arbitrary/accidental factors), and I thought that \\"survival of the fittest\\" was an old favorite of many conservatives, even fascists.  So, in sum, I just don't understand why this criticism is being made at all.<br />As far as \\"lacking in concrete evidence,\\" I think that's kind of a silly criticism for a book which is written specifically for a mass audience, plus it's wrong anyway.  Diamond presents PLENTY of fascinating, thought-provoking, entertaining evidence for his thesis, and if you want more you can read lots more about it all over the place!  <br />As far as \\"ignoring human variables\\" (especially \\"culture\\" and \\"religion\\"), that gets to the heart of Diamond's whole argument, and people who make this criticism either don't get Diamond's argument or just don't LIKE it (probably because it implies that THEIR \\"culture\\" and/or \\"religion\\" are not inherently any more wonderful or superior to any others, although they certainly may be more adaptive in a Darwinian \\"survival of the fittest\\" sense).  <br />The thing is, this whole question is a \\"chicken and egg\\" paradox.  In other words, is northern European Protestantism (for instance) more powerful than, let's say, Native American religions, because it is inherently \\"better\\" in some sense, or is it more that northern European Protestantism HAPPENED to win out (for all kinds of reasons not under their control, like germs, which they didn't even know about), and as the victors they got to write history (and, not surprisingly, portray themselves in the most positive light).  Just to take one powerfully intriguing example, what if Europeans had come over to America and been decimated by native American diseases instead of the other way around?  That ALONE probably would have stopped the Europeans from defeating the Indians.  Imagine if a few survivors had sailed back to Europe carrying these diseases and Europe had largely been wiped out as well.  Among many other things, I don't think too many people would be making the argument today that European civilization was superior to any other, that's for sure!<br />Anyway, the bottom line here is that this is a great book.So, pay no heed to the ideologues and nitpickers, read the book for yourself, and enjoy a fantastic story!

6305750750|5.0|This is episode I, meaning it relies heavily on the five later chapters to fill in the gaps. I know lots of people were confused by all that was happening and to be honest, there were more things going on than we're used to in Star Wars films. The writing, which came under the heaviest criticism, was very similar in tone and nature to the three previous films. The difference is that we were all younger and more forgiving of the simple innocence. It seems out of place in today's cynical atmosphere, but it's to his credit that he kept the tone similar to those that came before. He kept it 'all-ages' rather than marketing it to 13 year olds the way they did with the inferior Matrix. How easily grown-ups forget the way they saw the world as children. This film explores more than we're used to seeing and that can be confusing, especially to the unimaginative. All the 'disappointed' people seemed to be saying they wanted the same thing served up again rather than treading new ground. This galaxy is populated by a mix of aliens, droids and humans. As humans we tend to think of droids and aliens as puppets rather than characters. Again, this is a shortcoming of the audience. The ideas Lucas brings up are also not popular, this probably hurt the film the most. Greed is a terrible thing in Star Wars, but in America we swear by it. Naboo, a beautiful artistic is beyond the realm of Earthlings who litter their environment. The style of this film is beautiful and shows us that film can be art when crafted by visionary directors. The design, the photography, the palette and scope of the film are truly magnificent.  There are so many spectacular scenes, places, characters and events in this film, you must see them for yourself. The podrace, though exciting and stunning, is the only part that detracts from the flow of the story. There are so many strong points that more than make up for this. The lightsabre duel between the three warriors is fierce, magnificent and thankfully silent - most directors would fill such a sequence with pointless dialogue to enhance the adversarial relationship. The ground battle between droids and aliens is beautifully done and briefly returns us to the glory days of epic films.  When it comes down to it, who are we to say this is not OUR Star Wars? It is George Lucas' Star Wars, always has been and always will be. This chapter fits in to the whole, though we are two more films from realizing that. The Phantom Menace is most like Return of the Jedi in color scheme, mood and atmosphere and I think it'll be part of the story turning full circle.  For everyone who said it's 'not what I expected', try opening your mind and not limiting the film to the scope of your own personal vision, and don't make the opinions of others your own. Maybe you'll start to enjoy it.
B00004TWZF|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies when it first came out in the states (although, admittedly, I never thought it was really all that good).  Now that I've seen the director's cut, it again becomes one of my favorites.  With all of the original scenes put back in, the movie makes a lot more sense, the relationships between characters are better defined,  and the movie has the kind of thoughtful pacing that goes along with the story--kind of like swimming underwater.  <br />The real insult is that these scenes were taken out of the movie for the American audience in the first place!  Well, at least we can now enjoy the movie as it was meant to be scene.
0671034065|5.0|L. Howard infuses from the beginning humor, you snicker though out the book. Its just plain fun!! Enjoy!
0800116917|5.0|&quot;When was the last time you saw a movie with an overture?&quot; I asked my friend, as the lights went down in the theatre.  We shared a nervous laugh, hoping that what followed could live up to this grandiose introduction, not to mention its reputation.  It does.<br />David Lean managed to make a tight three and a half hour movie.  There are no wasted moments, no superfluous scenes.  The story moves forward with impeccable thrust, never offering a dull moment.  The greatest testament I can offer is that I didn't look at my watch once; and for someone with an attention span as short as mine, that's a major accomplishment.<br />I was awed by this movie's epic beauty.  That sounds like an odd statement to make about a David Lean movie, but I was still surprised at how beautiful it managed to be.  The man really knew how to use a horizon.  The shots of the slow sunrise, of the Howitat and Bedouin caravan crossing the Nefud desert, of the fallen train, and especially of Sherif Ali's entrance riding his camel in from the distance, are all magical in their composition.  Not to mention the way he photographs Lawrence's piercing blue eyes and shiny blonde hair.  He looks the part of an angel.<br />Besides being a skilled visual director, Lean also manages to be a great storyteller as well.  In a movie so full of drama, sometimes the evils of melodrama set in.  Lean manages to avoid this.  Even in the tensest of scenes, such as the ironic killing of Gasim or Lawrence's torture, he is very economic in what he chooses to show, never forcing the drama.  It is a very effective narrative.<br />What surprised me most about the movie is its perfect use of comedic relief.  This comes from both the wit of Robert Bolt's script (&quot;You're a clown, Lawrence,&quot; he is told early on by a superior officer.  &quot;Ah well, we can't all be lion-tamers,&quot; he glibly replies.  A great line, that), and the foolish actions of some of the characters (such as Audar's perfect over-the-top buffoonery, and Allenby's gross military pomposity).  The humour is paced perfectly.  It never gets in the way of the narrative, and provides opportunity for further character development.<br />All that being said, the greatest aspect of this movie is its impressive cast of actors.  What a great group of legendary actors we have here.  Omar Sharif is cool and majestic; Alec Guinness offers his wit and dignity; Anthony Quinn (almost unrecognizable) brings brutishness and charisma.  Even Jose Ferrer and Claude Rains in supporting roles add key elements to the picture.  And of course, Peter O'Toole is perfect as Lawrence, capturing all of his boyish charm, beauty, and British snobbery.  And eventually, he manages to capture his courage as well.<br />For all of these reasons and more, this film manages to live up to its reputation as a great and entertaining work.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic is best movie that I have seen. It is exciting, sad and romanic. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful in their role as Jack and Rose. Titanic is my favorite movie. In my appreciation Titanic should get 10 stars.
B00003CWOL|3.0|The only reason I can give this movie three stars instead of two is because it hurts me to slam a Kevin Smith movie.  I had so much hope for this movie, and the first thirty minutes is some of Kevin's finest work.  However, once the film introduces the religious side players (Rickman, Hayek, Rock) the film takes a serious down turn.  I never thought I would see Chris Rock NOT being funny, but he managed to pull it off in this film.  The ridiculous religious diatribes which are spouted out between the cast members are enough to put me to sleep, and the whole Alanis Morisette ending made me want to run out of the theater.  I am a huge fan of Smith's previous work, I hope his next film is a return to a more &quot;Askew-like&quot; production.
B000002H70|5.0|I don't believe in picking a favorite album of any band, but if I was forced to in the case of The Cure it would be Disintegration. It not only has some of the best Cure songs on the album, but the arrangement of the songs on the disc is perfect. It is an all-the-way-through album for sure. No skipping is necessary.  It is Robert Smith at his best. I am familiar with all The Cure albums and this is the one to get if you are unfamiliar with the Cure and are interested in getting to know them. It is great.

0312954468|5.0|So some people may quibble that the historical facts are inacurate, but when the book is as stirring and as emotional as this who cares! It centres around three characters Taita; the eunuch slave with a notourious reputation and a heart of gold, Tanus; the mighty warrior hero and Lostris the Princes and, what you could call the &quot;star&quot; of the novel. Smith takes us on a journey through Egypt; which are depicted with such astonishing detail that after a while the setting almost surrounds you and thus are able to feel every heat wave and hear every chariot or dessert bird that flows from the fictional surroundings. From here Taita narrates you through his life and makes you feel for everything he describes about. Never has there been such a monumental character invented; you feel and breath for him, you eventually will feel as you have known him all of his life...which you have! <br />It would take an eternity for me to say to you how magnificent each sentance and paragraph is, so I'll just say this: You will end up knowing the characters so well that you'll feel everything they do. You get to know the land so well that you will be emersed in the atmosphere. And because of this, you will be taken on an emotional rollercoaster of Godzilla like proportians. <br />It has one of the most emotional scenes I have ever read. But if it wasn't as well written or as brilliantly portrayed as this IS than you would never feel such kind of emotion. So I have to say a massive thumbs up to Wilbur Smith for such an awe inspireing novel and two thumbs up for anyone who has the sense to take the time out to read one of the best books ever written!
B000002J1O|5.0|Fine album. Battle of Epping Forest is where liquidlen comes from. Really nice record. Really.
B000001YOW|4.0|it really seems like a transitory work to me.  The previous recording, The Sky Moves Sideways, really gives me the vibe of a 90's &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (without actually copying).  The subsequent recording, &quot;Stupid Dream&quot;, is probably THE best CD to come out in 1999.<br />So, its not that &quot;Signify&quot; is not good, because if it was the first recording I ever encountered by PT, it would probably be my favorite.  However, I saw where they went before I saw where they were going. If circumstances were different, &quot;Signify&quot; would most likely get five stars from me, but its bookends are so compelling, I really must distinguish this one.<br />Don't listen to me, though, buy it.  Then buy more.  I don't get paid to say this.  You really can't go wrong.
B000002U82|4.0|Aye!  An excellent masterpiece indeed for Pink Floyd's early days...My favorite track on this album is most definitely &quot;Us and Them&quot;.  The reason why I don't give this one a five is because I compare it to the work done AFTER dark side... Pink Floyd is one band that continues to get better and better.... seeing as how they have had numerous better albums since then, I won't say this is their bast work... however, I do recomment &quot;The Division Bell&quot;.  Gilmour shows his true colors and I haven't heard a finer piece than &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot;... So my rating for Dark Side is 4.9999999 stars :)  and continued improvement!!  Kickass!
6304458304|5.0|To be the best movie of an actor, the film has to say something that stands true on its own, that will last forever. Think of Jimmy Stewart in &quot;Its a Wonderful Life&quot;, Hanks in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. Eastwood has made many great movies that move you; only In the Line of Fire (ILF) and the Bridges of Madison County change you forever. These are movies that you can think about for a long time afterwards.<br />ILF is Eastwood's greatest film because it has him fighting a battle where ALL of the cards are stacked against him. Noone believes in his analysis that there is a killing hunting the President, save his only contemporary who he has to use all his remaining influence to get himself placed on Presidential detail. Eastwood is not in control, he is not supremely more powerful physically but he persists for what he knows is right--you are soon pulling for him. Other movies have played the chase to get to the assasin first before, but what makes this movie better is that you have the mood of failure hanging over Eastwood's character from the JFK assassination and the sense that Eastwood, too may not be the man he was way back then. Its also a question if America is as great as we used to be?<br />Along the way, Eastwood has grown as a person, and his test of Renee Russo's interest in him if she turns back for a glance is one of those priceless tips of human nature (like looking into a person's eyes when you talk to them) we seem to not pass down to our young people as we should today. A truly magic moment.<br />The conclusion of this film that we are not defined by the events of our lives but what we believe in our hearts and act on uplifts and reminds us of the greatness that is in all of us, as long as we don't become bitter and full of hate as the John Malkovitch killer has become. The choice Eastwood's character makes to stay on the side of good contrasts with the killer's choice and reminds us of the true price of heroism is indeed steep but the person we become when we chose this makes a wonderful human being who someday will triumph in the end for the good of us all.s indeed steep but the person we become when we chose this makes a wonderful human being who someday will triumph in the end for the good of us all.
0684853523|4.0|When faced with a King book, no matter its subject matter, expect to be fully entertained.  Though On Writing may be a how-to book, there's plenty of stuff in here that many non-writers would be interested in.  The first half the book is a loose autobiography, perhaps more accurately described as a scattered collection of anecdotes (I believe this is something close to what King calls it, too) than a complete dossier.  Many of the stories are quite funny, especially the interaction between King and his brother.  The most surprising part of this section is King's drinking/drug problems -- I had no idea, though I must say, I always wondered about his monumental production in the late 80's.  I think in one year, 3 books came out basically all at the same time -- Misery, Eyes of the Dragon, and Dark Tower II: Drawing of the Three.  Throw in the Tommyknockers, too, and what you have there is King's second renaissance, thanks to beer and blow.  Of course drugs almost killed him, but hey, you have to admit, those were some pretty damn good books.    The second part of the book is all about writing, and I must say, I'm not so sure King imparts such illuminating wisdom.  He says outrageous stuff like how all first drafts of books should be written in three months (Hey, Mr. King, not everybody can do what you do!), or that you should average something like 2000 words a day.  Those are King-sized goals to say the least.  Outside of the unusual quantitative requirements, everything else he says has been said before: leave out the adverbs, second draft should be smaller than the first draft, blah blah blah.  Don't expect anything earth-shattering, but do expect to have fun.    The last part of the book is his account of his run-in with a truck that almost killed him.  This was printed in The New Yorker in its entirety a couple of months ago.  And then there are a couple of appendices, both pertaining to writing.  Actually, I think the first appendix here might be the best part of the book -- King shows us a draft of a story, then an edited version of it, complete with proofreading marks.  Studying and learning this section would no doubt greatly benefit a writer.  The second part is a list of recommended books.

0790749998|4.0|This movie is a must see for the action that fills the film. Jet Li and the others put on the moves that keep you in awe. If you like Jackie Chan, you like this movie. The storyline is a little slow but the action makes up for it. Martial arts fans will like this movie!

6303942830|5.0|The lesser charactors were the best...Eric Schweig's role should have been brought out more, especially his relationship with Alice.  The ending was tearful, but I could not figure out if she jumped because of Uncas or she wanted to die. I hope they remake the movie with all the shots of Uncas and Alice. (Eric Schweig is breathtaking.  I would like to know what other movies he has been in.) The ending was a ?  I could not tell if they were side by side.   I assume yes... I did see the move when it first came out.  I rented it recently, and watched it 4 times...so now I have decided to purchase it...  I loved it...
B00004TRD8|5.0|I live in England and this compilation (as far as I know)isn't available here. So, I bought a multi-region DVD player - and I am so glad that I did! This is the ultimate in SCI-FI heaven! I absolutely LUV the special commentary that is available, and this HAS TO BE the best DVD available on the market at the moment. Even if it is available in England, I will buy more special edition DVDs from AMAZON.COM in the future (but perhaps I'll check the British branch first!)If you're hestitaing, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Buy it now and import it if you have to.
B00004X01U|5.0|Love the originality of this music.  Because she is ever-changing, Madonna is never boring.  &quot;Music&quot; makes you want to dance - totally energizing!  Wish the &quot;Music&quot; video was half as impressive as this work of art.
B00004Y6TQ|3.0|I know this might wind up sounding like the old &quot;the food is horrible and the portions are too small&quot; review, but bear with me. I first have to say, irregardless of the quality of the content, I have a huge problem with paying full LP price for a domestic EP. 7 tracks, 1/2 hour of music for 15.00? I'm sorry, that's just unacceptable. it should cost 10.00 tops. If I wasn't such a huge fan, I wouldn't have touched this. Content wise, this is a long shot from her best and a far cry from essential. &quot;Homogenic&quot; was a masterwork and remains in my &quot;Top 10&quot; of all time list. I also still listen to it at least weekly. &quot;Debut&quot; is another all time favorite... The rest of them are not as great, but this is the first Bjork release I've been out and out disapointed with. The first track is a throw-away instrumental theme that could be anybody's. &quot;I've seen it all&quot; is pretty great, but we're not breaking new ground here. Other than that, there are spots that are good... usually parts of songs rather than whole songs. Overall, I really could have passed on this, especailly at the price. still, it's better than most of the major label junk you'll find out there. It's not a horrible album, just an O.K. one.
630420065X|5.0|Mission Impossible is one of my favorite movies. I have already watched it numerous times and will probably watch it again before too long. Some buffs of the TV show weren't too pleased with a certain defection, but without it the movie wouldn't have been half as cool.<br />The basic story here is a winner. I won't give it away, but it made perfect sense. (Not a plot to take over the world or blow up a major city, etc.)<br />The special effects were just a bonus to the script, although there were a couple incidents of being a little unrealistic. There have been much worst in past movies, so I don't really hold it against Mission Impossible.<br />The characters were well represented by their actors. Cruise may have overacted a touch but nobody seemed out of place in their role. Just like in the show of old, they were always cool under pressure and had the cool little gadgets to get the job done.<br />When I heard there was a sequel in the works I knew it would not live up to the first. They should have let it be. It's a rare occurance that a sequel can top an original, especially when the original is as good as this one.
0312952813|4.0|Although this book is not quite as good as the first Bosch novel, The Black Echo, it is still amazing.  Connelly is a great mystery writer and his characters are fully developed.  The plot moves along at a rapid pace and the ending is completely satisfying.  So many times when you read a mystery, the suspense builds and the ending is always a let down.  Michael Connelly never lets you down.  Well written and a great read.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Yes, when I first saw this movie, I thought, &quot;Oh, another Ben Hur&quot; or another &quot;Spartacus 2000.&quot; Yet when I sat my behind down in that theater, I was nothing but wide-mouthed astounded and amazed at the picture that director Ridley Scott had in store for this summer. From the beginning I knew it wasn't like anything I had seen in a long time. Russell Crowe was just...superb in this very different role. Joaquin Phoenix was a great image of an evil character, although there were motives behind his behavior that made you feel just a little sorry for him. &quot;Gladiator&quot; made my eyes water not much with sadness, but at the beauty of this remarkable storyline of strength, honor, betrayal, and the fall of both the hero as well as the villain. I don't know how long they took to make a movie like this, but it doesn't look like the typical &quot;eye candy&quot; that was put together by computers in two days. This one's a keeper and a treasure in anyone's movie collection. This is clearly the best film Ridley Scott has ever directed, and I think in his heart, he knows this. Watch this one without expecting it to totally change your life, and you will see the reason for most of the good reviews.
0380788624|1.0|Despite all the accolades here at Amazon, this book leaves several things to be desired. One is a coherent narrative. (It's not a matter of being lost in the fun little forays he takes into crypto as I too am a Computer Scientist...I know the technology he's talking about.) <br />While it's true that he throws three balls in the air at once (WWII Germans, WWII US Marine, Contemporary Data Haven Dudes, plus a few minor strands) he drops them all. Nothing ever comes of the great Conspiracies he sets up. Everything sort of fizzles and just ends at the ending. No connections are made (in any significant way, other than chance, unexplained meetings or enterly superfical segues) between the various groups, nothing ties together the threads. <br />The closest similar writer I can think of is Thomas Pynchon in terms of conspiracies and seemingly anomalous events actually being deeply interwoven. Except in Pynchon they actually interweave and suck you into the intense level of paranoid required to belive in things like a grand mail cabal (viz., Crying of Lot 49). Here, events kind of bump into each other and fall down, berift of the nuance required for such schemes to work.<br />Perhaps the worse, if superficial, example of this is when he kills off one character half way through the book, only to have him appear, unexplained, again towards the end. (A character whose biblical- and UNIX- significant name, becomes yet another promising premise that retreats into banality.)<br />There are lots of other examples where Stephenson can't hold up the foundation he lays out, (such as fantastically designed warehouses, elaborate crypto- and naming games and odd chance encounters of characters, none of which amount to anything) but describing such might ruin the book for other readers, so....<br />Finally, what is his problem with women in this book? While he spends plenty of time trashing academia's sillinesses (for no apparent reason), his absolute lack of insight into his few female characters (minor characters at that) resembles nothing so much as the perspective of a teenage gamer whose closest interaction with women comes from adult web sites. The flat treatments are boring and insulting. (And I am hardly what you would call a 'feminist'.)<br />All in all a disappointing book from the author of the much better 'Snowcrash'. It really seems like this is a rough draft, pushed out in a hurry to satisfy an editorial deadline.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is a truly beautiful story; when watching it, I felt like I was reading a very compelling book, seeing it all being acted out before me. Kevin Spacey is an accomplished actor. Mena Suvari was very &quot;talented.&quot; Yet that wasn't entirely all what the movie was about. It was a story about random suburban life anywhere in America. An unappreciated man, with a materialistic wife, a troubled, ignored daughter, a very &quot;hungry&quot; girl, and a &quot;strange&quot; yet very smart filmmaker are the main characters in this very engaging screenplay. All props go out to those who played in the movie, and certainly director Sam Mendes. If you haven't seen this movie you have missed out on an all-time classic that will never, ever grow old in years afterwards.
0385472951|3.0|This book was a fast read, alluding to the fact that it was exciting, but not too difficult to digest in a short time period.  In typical Grisham style, the characters, plot and setting were all attention getting and holding.  As the plot thickens, there is a feeling that a surprising twist is coming.  These are the things that maintain the audience from one John Grisham book to the next.  Unfortunately as the story climaxes, it also fizzles, and the reader is left dissapointed.
6305499365|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie!!!  It definitely hits home for us cubicle dwellers!!  Milton is my favorite!! He's like the guy who will take it for so long and then look out, boom!!!  Everyone should see this movie who wants to laugh, dance, and say &quot;that is definitely me&quot;.  Is there a soundtrack available?  I sure hope so, because I want it!!
B00003CXE7|2.0|Ridley Scott's made TV commercials before feature films.  I never saw that style in his films (Alien, Blade Runner) before.  In commercials there is not time to develop an idea so commercial makers get you aroused with style rather than substance.  So it is with Gladiator.  The fight scenes are exciting but meaningless.  I couldn't really tell what was going on but it was exciting.  Some of the transitions reminded me of a car ad.  The dialog was not good.  There was no economy in developing the characters so the movie is 20 minutes too long.  If you want to see a great spectacle then rent Ben Hur.
6305280762|3.0|Director John Guillerman deserves credit for keeping this movie on the rails.It contains one of the most overlong scenes in movie history,a scene where Paul Newman and others have to escape down a broken flight of stairs.Irwin Allen showed his lack of imagination by repeating this scene in the awful movie &quot;when time ran out&quot;,but with a bridge instead(he also repeated a TI falling scene in &quot;the swarm&quot;).This film has a good performance by Steve Mcqueen and Paul Newman who manage to save the story with some good action scenes in between the soap-opera drama.The special effects were very good for the time and the actual &quot;minature&quot; of the burning building was 110 feet tall.
0790729989|1.0|If you haven't seen the movie (just don't..ok?  Go buy &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;) skip the spoiler that's coming up.  <br />Let me emphasize that I love dark movies.  I thought &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; was a charge of pure energy.<br />Maybe this  was too realistically disgusting or maybe it was just bad.  Either way, I thought it was revolting and sadistic.  Even if the movie's makers are getting such a kick from torture, there should be some kind of &quot;wink&quot; at the audience, an acknowledgement of evil within us all, or something.  Or maybe I just want a different movie because I hated this so much.<br />The atmosphere was fairly well done and Kevin Spacey is Kevin Spacey, which is of course to say, he's great.  He has all your attention when he's on screen.  The other leads are wasted or bad.  Brad was just bad.  The pacing is deadly slow in places -- one can't get by on atmosphere alone.<br />To add insult to injury, the instant I saw Paltrow go all pink saying she was pregnant I knew that she was a goner.  The exact nature of her demise was one I couldn't have guessed..until I saw...&quot;the package&quot;... At that point it was all I could to stop myself from tracking Morgan Freeman down and say...&quot;Why, Morgan, WHY were you in this gory piece of claptrap?&quot;<br />The worst sort of Hollywood nonsense -- pointlessly violent,  weighed down with a smarmy self-importance and twitchy bad acting from Brad Pitt -- AND predictable.  <br />Avoid.  I'd rate it a minus, if I had that option.  (Excluding Specey.)
0881032565|5.0|This was the best book I've ever read in my life.  When I recieved the letter informing me that I had to reaad a book over the summer for school, I thought to myself, &quot;what a waste of time&quot;.  Yet I began to read and within the first pages, I was hooked.  I couldn't put the book down! ine night I even read fifty pages, and I didn't have to.  In the beginning of the story, a mysterious person, refered to as U.N. Owen, sends ten peoplenotes saying they should take an opporunity to visit Indian Island.  The charactors agree, thinking U.N. Owen is a distant friend.  From the point the people arriveat Indian Island everything turns into hell.  All ten people die, and it is a musteru to find out who it is.  They all die in their own mysterious ways according to a poem posted above all of the inmates beds.  Agatha Christie kept me guessing every second who the murderer was.  Don't skip a page and read the Epilouge or else you'll miss out!
B00004RFFM|4.0|I enjoyed this shocking shark thriller. A surprise at every turn, absolutely the worse nightmare come true for an unfortunate group of researchers. Shocking and gripping without relying on gratuitous sex or profanity. Overall quite well done, including the astonishing special effects. Thumbs up for Renny Harlin!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Some of the reviews im reading here are pathetic.<br />I keepreading that 'Cruise steals the show' that is a lot of .... I would not say that there is just one main part, each character is just as important as the next and each is focused on the same amount of time.  Another thing people are saying 'its too long'. NOWAY! The length is good for this type of movie. <br />It is brilliant, i am actually writing this as i am watching it for the second time.  Honestly i would call this a suspense film. For most other movies you always feel this 'great sensation' of suspense at the very end of the movie. But this did not happy with this movie, i felt this sensation throughout more than half of the movie. I could not look away, and if anything i was hoping it would not end.<br />So those are just a few things i thought i should share. I would consider this being one of my favourite movies and if you dont go see it, you have no idea what you are missing out off.  YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT. It is a near masterpiece.
B000002UAU|2.0|I love The Beatles. I am too young to remember them as a going concern, so it is not nostalgia that makes me suggest they rank amongst the most significant artists of the 20th Century. It is ludicrous to suggest they do not. I own and cherish all their albums. Even now I find it hard to believe they ever split. Why would anyone break up something so successful on every level? It's beyond me. Their brilliance lay not in their social significance(which will fade with time)but rather the breadth as well as the depth of their material. However one thing I have always found disagreeable about them (or rather the myth they have become) is the view that Sergeant Pepper is the greatest album of all time. In my honest opinion it is one of their weakest records. Too many of the songs are mediocre. Fixing A Hole, Getting Better and Good Morning, Good Morning to name just three are by their high standards ordinary, and that's being kind. Another thing that irks me about the record is that the so-called &quot;concept&quot; peters out after a couple of songs. They don't link,except in the most feeble manner imaginable. I love the Beatles and it bothers me that young people will hear of them and decide to investigate and because of its reputation make Sergeant Pepper their starting point. My advice is don't. Get Revolver or the White Album instead.
B00004X01U|5.0|Music is a must have for any Madonna fans.  Once again, Madonna sheds a new face with a mix of Paris club, country, folk and new wave.  Her first single Music is a smash, but watch for Amazing and Impressive Instant to heat up the charts soon.<br />Worth the wait and the money.
B000001DYD|5.0|While it is easy to lump many female musicians in two categories, being the pretty, deep, soft girlies like sarah maclaughlin or fiona apple and the angry loud sort like L7 or Hole, PJ HArvey has always resisted such labels.<BR> This album is often pitted as the angry riot grrl classic, but with a closer look, one can see it's much more than that.  there are the sad, strange stories that have come to mark her work, along with sparse, heavy guitars, drums, and bass.<BR> The sound is sparse and raw, with Polly Jean's powerfully emotional voice and disturbing poetic lyrics always at the forefront.  And she certainly wails.  I think &quot;Legs&quot; and &quot;Missed&quot; are some of the most affecting songs voice-wise.  There is ofcourse the wierd girl anthem of sorts &quot;Fifty-Foot Queenie.&quot;  and did I forget the classic, &quot;Man Size?&quot;  That is after all, the song that got me to notice her in the first place.<BR> All in all, this is a classic and only a hint at what she would move on to.  Many have lamented the lack of guitar in the more recent stuff.  Listening to this, you can easily understand why.  But I really think this album is only a beginning into what is some of the most beautiful music ever, whether the writer be male or female.
0375804013|5.0|Grover was my favorite Sesame Street character as a child (and still is) and for some strange reason it isn't easy to find books on him. This one is so cute and adorable, just like &quot;Lovable, Furry, Old Grover&quot; himself!<br />As the adult you open the first page and instantly know the conclusion but looking at it from a child's viewpoint it is suspensefully entertaining. If you have a child that pushes books away alot I promise you he or she will NOT do that with THIS BOOK!<br />I highly recommend this book up to age 100! It is simply hiliarious! (When I first read it in the store I cracked up laughing and people were looking at me and I didn't care!) BUY THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED--I PROMISE! YOU'LL PROBABLY LOVE IT MORE THAN YOUR CHILD! IT IS VERY FUN TO READ!
0679410503|5.0|Anne Rice is the best modern writer on vampires.  I have read them all and she rocks.  The coolest scenarios and she reads like an intelligent airport paperback book writer.  Her writing goes down easy like a comic book.  I have written a book on vampires too if you are interested.  It's called Seamus and Emer.  It's available on Amazon so take a look.  Good Luck!  Bye Bye!
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Personally I loved this movie, great cars, fast action, and a few scenes with Angelina Jolie.  There could have been more scenes with her, but the movie's true stars were the incredible cars.  This is the type of movie that a subscriber to Road and Track will love and a fan of quality foreign films will hate.  If you love exciting action flicks and cool cars, watch this movie.  If you are looking for a quality movie watch Gladiator or American Beauty, which are both great movies in the very sense of the word.  Gone in 60 seconds isn't exactly Cage's best work, but it was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a while.
0783246641|5.0|The book is horrible, funny and essential, but they could never have made it into a film.  The film is also horrible, funny and essential, but it ain't the book.  Mary Harron wisely decided not to do a Cannibal Holocaust on this one, and emphasised instead the black humour.  She and co-screenwriter Guenevere Turner (who'd have thought that that nice girl from Go Fish could end up writing American Psycho?) deliver the funniest film about twisted men since Fight Club.<br />Despite the contributions of Harron, Turner, the production designer, the cinematographer and the rest of the cast, it has to be said that this is Christian Bale's movie.  Leonardo Di Caprio just isn't in this league.  Bale transformed himself into an extraordinary simulacrum of a human being, a perfectly-accented, tautly-muscled, immaculately groomed Americanoid boy, whose cheery smile is constantly belied by eyes as dead as gun muzzles.  He's the most memorable cinema nutcase in a mainstream film since Travis Bickle.  The scene when he puts Huey Lewis on the stereo, dresses in a plastic raincoat and dances round the room preparatory to putting an axe into Jared Leto's head made me almost puke with laughter, and his instant turnaround into a frothing, bawling maniac is quite incredible.  His breakdown later on in the film almost makes you sympathise with this utterly hollow character.  <br />It's pretty unthinkable that American Psycho will get an Oscar, but Bale proves himself to be one of the most technically adept and assured actors of his generation with this performance.  Slasher film fans will be let down (I saw it in a cinema in Plymouth UK, with an audience of people who clearly expected a Manhattan Chainsaw Massacre and who were audibly disappointed not to get it) but it's a sublimely horrible and great film.  Nice to see Willem Dafoe finally being cast as a sane person, too.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary Movie is the funniest movie of the summer.  It combined the horror movie genre with a comedy.  That combination was sure to get major laughs.  Even though the jokes were mostly immature it was still hilarious to watch.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever seen.<br />It has everything, its starts of as a love story, turns into an action movie, then leaves the audience in tears. Most Oscar winners are dull. Finally an Oscar winner that actually deserves its award.

0803292406|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good. This book was a great English thriller who horrified the English people in old England. I gave the book four stars because at some points it got confusing. The book was meant to be scary but today it is nothing compared to what we have today. The story is about a man name Dr. Jekyll who creats a potion to turn him into another man  named Mr. Hyde so he can do his dirty work. The book is suspenseful and is a great mystery. The surprise ending and constant suspense builds this book up to be a pretty good book. This book could have been better if it had more mystery and more action. I also think the book could have been written  in 10 pages or less (this book is for everybody who peeks at the end before finishing). Other than that I would recomend it to mystery and horror lovers.

The story line is the best I've ever seen, the fx are the best, this is the best movie out there. If you can only get one movie, this should be it.

B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I saw the movie two days ago and I'm still thinking about it all the time. The movie is wonderful and puts you in the middle of a feeling storm difficult to forget. The soundtrack is really a musical soundtrack with really good tracks but the best thing, at least for me, it's the reminding of each scene on the movie...
B00001SIES|4.0|This album has very very special place in my heart.My musical taste wasnt very developed until I heard &quot;Sunburn&quot;.Before that I was casual listener,who didnt know anything about alternative bands.  But Muse really rised my interest and through the web I learned more.After I heard Muscle Museum,I decided to order this album.  The reason I give it *only* 4 stars is that there is still something that can be better.I cant put my fingers on it.Maybe they just need to grow more as a band.  There isnt any song I dislike.Usually I listen the whole album.Still,every song has different atmosphere,so I may sometimes skip the songs that arent equal to my state of mind at the time.  So,if you like Nirvana,Radiohead,and all other alternative music,you should order this album.  Muse has their own sound,though.Matts voice is maybe similar to Thom Yorkes(my other fave,BTW)but the sounds are pure Muse!  I cant wait their second album!
B000002ULO|4.0|I found this album to be very enyoyable. However, I feel that it falls short of it's potential because of the inclusion of Used to be Bad and Ready to Love.  These songs are not terrible but they just do not fit well with the rest of the material.  Does every song have to be great to make a great album???  No, in fact, IF You Wanna and Great Day are average tunes but they flow well with the other songs and make sense within the context of the album. That said, I still highly recommend this CD and hope Sir Paul has a few more up his sleeve.  Long Live!!!!!!!
B00000064G|5.0|Yes, the album is still a masterpiece.  Yes, Nick Drake deserves to be heard by all people.  And yes, this is the real world--and in the real world nothing is safe from advertising.  Still, there was something undeniably sad about hearing &quot;Pink Moon&quot; on a commercial--regardless of how tastefully done--and knowing that the &quot;as-heard-on-the-TV-commercial&quot; tagline would soon be plastered all over what once seemed like such a personal secret to so many people.  Shame on VW, cheers to Nick Drake.
0783226063|4.0|Actually, the editorial review above gets the whole thing wrong in terms of what edit of the film David Lynch disowned.  In reality, it was the later Universal television version of the film, which is about 4 hours long (with commercial breaks), that Lynch would not authorize and he asked that his directorial credit be replaced by the Alan Smithee pseudonym. Lynch did this because the Universal longer version was not approved by him, and Universal made changes and edits (and added their own narration and extra voiceovers, as well as horrible animation and illustrations as an explanatory prologue) that Lynch would never have approved if he had edited a longer, director's cut of the film.  The longer version is valuable as it contains some of the key missing scenes, such as Paul Atreides' fight to the death with the Fremen Jamis; a scene in which the Lady Jessica is confronted by the Shadout Mapes, the Housekeeper; another scene of the Water of Life ceremony (with drowned baby sandworm) is more faithful to the novel.  There may even be more than one long version of Dune floating around, but none of them are authorized.  Even with all its flaws this movie continues to enthrall--it's not a masterpiece but it's good, but I always recommend reading the novels anyway.  Get the Berkley books Dune Encylopedia too, if you can find it...good hunting.

B0000026WD|5.0|okay, mj's got his 'troubles' or whatever. his ego's in full bear here throughout this album, as he expresses his fear of everyone trippin' on the king of pop and all his exploits (and this is prior 2 the scandal that has perhaps wrecked his careerin the u.s. 4ever). but musically and sonically-wow! the beats still hit hard. they may sound stiff and regimented, unnatural (perhaps resembling himself?) but put this thing thru some big speakers or good quality headphones and turn it up. but poor guy-yeesh! either the women are going 2 leave him (in 'can't let her get away' and 'give in 2 me') or u-gotta-keep-our-love-quiet ('in the closet') or everyone's buggin' out on him ('why u wanna trip on me'). he has 2 realize that the lyrics he writes cannot be looked at as generic or for-the-lyric's-sake; theyr'e gonna come back 2 him. a very worthy listen; an album-as-biography. (hey-how many superstars are willing 2 bare all 2 their public? on this level it should be commended)

B00004W3MS|5.0|The title of this review may appear to be pretentious and contrived to one who has not yet experienced Sigur Ros' new album, AGAETIS BYRJUN.  But in truth, this is the closest approximation that language provides one in which to describe this breathtakingly beautiful album.  Too often in our world, words such as love, beautiful, and brilliant get thrown around like dirty laundry rather than savored and used only to express their true meanings.  We deprive our language of its effect through our careless abuse of the only adjectives we have to describe the pen-ultimate.  But, if there ever was an album that deserved to be called &quot;breathtakingly beautiful,&quot; then this is it.    Pressed for a description of Sigur Ros' intoxicating blend of melody and sound, Liquid Dreams is the phrase that most succinctly interprets this beauty into English.  Yes, Sigur Ros' are from Iceland.  No, they do not write or sing in English.  But that may be the most astounding thing about this album: the feeling of the music completely transcends all language barriers.  AGAETIS BYRJUN is proof in the argument that music is the universal language.  The unique mix of the traditional instruments in modern music (guitar, bass, drums, keyboard) with the new (processed noises, feedback, distortion, white noise, reverb) and even the antiquated (orchestra, chamber music, chorale pieces) - all this - makes for a listen that is unlike anything you have experienced before.  It may harken references to classical, free-form jazz, pop, prog-rock, etc..., but Sigur Ros are none of these things.  Their unconventional blend of texture and style are best exemplified on tracks like the dreamy and subtle &quot;Avalon,&quot; the delightfully smooth &quot;Staralfur,&quot; and most of all during the excellent &quot;Hjartad Hamast (Bamm Bamm Bamm).&quot;  It is on this track that Sigur Ros' textural beauty is most affectingly showcased.  Strings glide and swell, while processed guitars whistle and whirr over tape loops and humming rhythms... all to climax in a buzzing, orgasmic chorus filled with heart-ache.  It is on this track that Sigur Ros prove just how musically important they are.  They are incomparable.  They are in a playing field all their own.  No one is even approaching this type of musical expression in the current music scene.  I don't believe that anyone ever has.    Key elements to the Sigur Ros sound are, as mentioned above, instrumentation and style, but - for the first time in a good while - the singer's voice plays a truly vital role in enhancing and creating the music.  Jon Por Birgisson's vocal croons, swoons, yelps, and dazzling falsetto are used less to express words, and more to emote.  In fact, as beautiful as the music is, his voice, in all its feminine grandieur, may eclipse it all.  One listen to his voice on songs such as &quot;Staralfur,&quot; or &quot;Viorar Vel Til Loftarasa&quot; and listeners will be swept into another plane.      In truth, &quot;otherworldly&quot; may be a better adjective to describe the sensual experience of this album.  Soon to be released in the U.S. (it exists as an import only, at the moment) AGAETIS BYRJUN is the perfect musical vision to open the new millenium... full of possibility, ingenuity, and above all, hope for the beauty of things to come.
0880381736|5.0|I have been a reader ever since I was born.  My father read books to me until I could read on my own, and unlike many other kids, I kept reading.  And I loved every minute of it. These books are beautifully written with complex, interesting characters, which is a quality I value greatly.  In order for a book or TV show to be truly good, the characters cannot be simple and flat.  The same goes for the plot. The Dragonlance book series ventures far from these adventurers, but never leave their birthplace of Krynn.  And I wouldn't want it to.  If you want to read about the plot, then you can read another one of these lovely 200 reviews.  I don't feel the need to repeat it.  I just wanted to say how I felt.
B00000J7S8|4.0|Needless to say I had never listened much to Jazz music until I discovered Diana Krall. I love her voice, and her music. I liked her &quot;Love Scenes&quot;, and &quot;All For You&quot; albums. This one is no exception, except that it just sounds a bit more commercial with the classical violins and stuff on the background, the other 2 CDs I own from her were more intimate and moody. Not that this CD isn't emotional or moody. It is a very good CD, with some very nice and humorous songs (like &quot;The Best Thing For You&quot; and &quot;Popsickle Toes&quot;), and of course sensual songs such as  &quot;Lets Face The Music And Dance&quot;. Her voice is deep, soothing, and her arrangements are quite unique.
B00004T20I|5.0|When Classic Records releases a new title on vinyl, it?s always special.  But when that title is the mono version of Jim Hendrix?s classic Axis Bold  as Love, it?s an event. Original mono pressings of this album (if you can  find them) go for as much as $2000. Several of the songs are noticeably  different than the stereo versions most of us know and love. In general,  the 180g vinyl pressing has considerably more bass than its CD counterpart,  although the sound on the CD is clearer in several places. The album was  mastered from the original mono masters by Eddie Kramer--the original  engineer on the sessions. Let?s talk about the specifics?<br />?EXP? is almost  40 seconds shorter on the vinyl, and the vocals by ?Paul Caruso? are  louder. The difference on the stereo version is extended feedback at the  end. ?Spanish Castle Magic? and ?Wait Until Tomorrow? boast a much better  low end than the CD. On the latter tune, the first note is too loud on CD.  The volume is corrected on the LP, but the song fades up to full volume, as  opposed to maintaining a consistent level throughout the track. One of the  other problems with the CD is audible tape hiss. The false ending on ?Ain?t  No Telling? is louder on the CD. The vinyl is much warmer on ?Little Wing?  and the end solo is more up front. <br />?If 6 Was 9? doesn?t have near as  much high end as the CD, and the bass is slightly muddy. Although the  song?s highs are much brighter on the CD, it also has considerable tape  hiss that isn?t heard on the vinyl. ?You Got Me Floatin?  is missing the  intro on the LP. ?Castles Made of Sand? has a cleaner intro on the CD; the  vinyl is slightly muddy in comparison, but features a different vocal  performance. ?One Rainy Wish? has much more bass on LP and a slightly  different ending. The title track, ?Bold as Love? is the one instance where  the CD is superior. Without the channel panning, the song is clearly  missing something. <br />The burning question here is: which one sounds  better? It all depends on your personal preference. The analog aficionados  will no doubt pick the vinyl. It?s much warmer than the CD and the bass  will literally shake the room. CD fans will be more than happy with the  sound on the CD (even if they need to crank up the bass a bit), and the  booklet is excellent. It?s a shame that it?s not included in the vinyl  pressing. On a positive note, the vinyl is on the Track label, plus when  you consider that the mono version has been out of print ever since the  original pressing was in the racks, this is an ideal item for the Hendrix  collectors out there. The choice is yours.
630587493X|5.0|This movie is pure magic. You Must See this. The Cast is perfect, the acting, and the direction by Chris Columbus (Mrs Doubtfire, Stepmom, and the 2001 blockbuster &quot;Harry Potter Movie&quot;) is truly wonderful. For what the story is about the other reviewers here have told it so well I would just be wasting space! Watching the trailer it builds itself as a Comedy, I would like to think of it as a Drama with comedy elements in it. The Music by James Horner is the best I have heard from him - (yes even after the masterpieces of Titanic, Aliens, Apollo 13, and Land Before Time) Even though on the Australian DVD it has an isolated music score I still brought the Soundtrack. It is one of the best scores you will hear from any composer. Truly Fantastic. This movie was sadly overlooked at the cinemas, and I believe with word of mouth it will get a new life on video and DVD. It is a movie you will not forget in a long time, and I believe 5 stars is too low a score for Bicentennial Man. It deserves so much more!! I know im praising it too much but it is THAT good. Hope you enjoy it.
B00000ILDF|1.0|I've seen &quot;Alien 3&quot; only once, when it was first released, and I absolutely hated it.  Reading the other reviews here on this movie, a majority of reviewers also seem to hate the movie.  There are a lot of reasons given as to why this is such a terrible movie and I agree with every one of them.  Here's a few more thoughts on this subject:<br />I loved &quot;Aliens&quot;.  It had all of the usual sweeping James Cameron themes - the self-sacrificing Heroic Male;  a female who grows during the course of the movie from a helpless observer to a heroine; a nascent love story that develops between these two characters; and a complex relationship between a parent figure and a child; all set in the backdrop of a terrifyingly fast paced action adventure story.<br />&quot;Aliens 3&quot; starts right off the bat to prove that it is NOT &quot;Aliens&quot; by annihilating all five of these Cameron themes.<br />Like many fans of &quot;Aliens&quot;, I'd grown quite fond of Newt and Hicks, and so it was just the downer of all time to see them killed off right at the beginning of &quot;Alien 3&quot;.<br />All through &quot;Alien 3&quot;, I kept wondering - WHY?  Killing off Newt and Hicks was so unnecessary, and so atypical of the Hollywood sequel industry. Michael Biehn was not exactly in a position to turn down a reprise of his role, since he never became a big movie star.  Carrie Henn never made another movie, but she would have been too old for the role anyway, and could have been replaced with another child actress.  Surely the movie moguls and bean counters would know from experience that the surest formula for a successful sequel would be to reprise the same familiar characters from the previous big hit.<br />And then there was the overall misandrist tone of the movie - this was a movie that could only have been written by a man-hater.  The movie is filled with male characters who exhibit only the worst male characteristics - extreme violence, cruelty, stupidity, greed, cowardice, and weird rituals.  Male virtues - compassion, loyalty, honor, duty, and courage under fire, are no where in sight.<br />Hicks gets killed off-screen, coolly and clinically, and the affection and budding romance with Ripley that was in &quot;Aliens&quot; is ignored  as if it never was.  Newt's role is stretched out a bit further as a corpse in an autopsy that Ripley insists on watching.  Remember how Ripley screamed and searched with such desperation when Newt slipped from her grasp into that ventilator shaft in &quot;Aliens&quot;?  Where is this same emotion in &quot;Alien 3&quot; when Ripley discovers that both Newt and Hicks are dead?  What a waste of energy for Ripley to have saved Newt in &quot;Aliens&quot;.  Does she even care anymore?<br />Ripley does get to become the undisputed star of this movie, complete with a hokey Christ-figure death scene at the end.<br />Finally, as the credits roll at the end of the movie, it all becomes clear.  Sigourney Weaver has a production credit!  That meant she had creative control of this movie!<br />And I remember the revelation that flashed into my mind at the time.  The movie studio had to cajole her into reprising the role of Ripley.  There were signs from her reactions in certain talk shows that she strongly disliked Michael Biehn in real life, for whatever reason.<br />So, I have always blamed Sigourney Weaver for killing off Hicks and Newt, and for creating this awful movie.  Whenever I watch &quot;Aliens&quot;, there is a certain pain and sadness in seeing Hicks and Newt come to life, to be saved by this actress who would betray them in the next movie.<br />I know of some hardcore &quot;Aliens&quot; fans who have never seen &quot;Alien 3&quot;, having heard in advance just how bad the movie was.  I wish I was one of those lucky people.ity, greed, cowardice, and weird rituals.

B00004X01U|5.0|MUSIC is as energetic and avant-garde an album as one would expect from the greatest pop/glam icon of all time. This, taken with EROTICA &amp; RAY OF LIGHT, helps comprise a literal holy trinity for music buffs and scholars of pop culture. Once more, Madonna proves that she--and ONLY she--can take the risks necessary to set trends and overturn former conceptions of what's &quot;in.&quot; These songs are terrific; buy the album. Simple as that.
B00004Z311|5.0|(Rating is based on expectations and historical importance.)<br />This Collector's Edition of Ridley Scott's 1985 movie has been one of the most eagerly-awaited titles on home video for years.  Apparently, this is the (virtually) never-before-seen original cut which was whittled away from 113 minutes to 89 for American audiences (by the same people who butchered Terry Gilliam's &quot;Brazil&quot;) and was subsequently criticized for being choppy and uneven as a result.  (Go figure.)  But &quot;Legend&quot; is a visually splendorous movie (of course-- it's a Ridley Scott film) that displays an unusually firm grasp of the fantasy genre in terms of its archetypes and setting.  (Jean Cocteau's &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; was a strong influence.)  Universal proves that it's never too late to right a wrong with this restoration.<br />For more detailed information about the history of &quot;Legend,&quot; visit its FAQ at [...]<br />Special kudos to Charles de Lauzirika (who also supervised the excellent &quot;Alien&quot; DVD) and all the folks who contributed to the production of this important release!
