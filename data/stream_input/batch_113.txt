B00HJJDUN4|5|Excellent!
B00JVHLS3G|4|BUY smaller grommets so this can fit properly~~~!!!!!
B00CK0L07A|5|Exactly what I needed and expected.
B008LUT6XS|5|by by smelly rooms
B004EW7OEK|5|I love this bumper<br />Great one
B004GYKO9S|4|Good product. It's not an issue per se, but these come with 6 hooks, not 5 has shown in the picture. I've put them in tire chains and they work as expected. This is a very strong cable. It was much harder than I expected to be able to latch the hooks on the chains because the rubber is so strong. They will definitely hold your tire chain in place. I rated this 4-starts only because I have yet to actually try them our in the mud/snow yet and don't know the longevity of the rubber. But I think these will perform well. And for ~7 bucks for a pack of two? Incredible value for sure.
B00NBT4774|5|As cute as the picture.  Couldn't resist
B0070I8V1U|5|Very good merchandise, I have already bought 2 sets, this is to help what friend buy
B0049Z6TC0|4|This is a nice key chain but it is not the exact chain as in the picture. It doesn't have the swivel in the chain.
B00HNW8MJ4|1|Did not fit my car as it said it would. I have to return it.
B00P05CJ54|5|Easy to install and great quality!
B00Z7KIZPA|5|Works great!
B000C803DO|5|Oem fit
B0002SR8AK|5|Good tool to have.
B002HXXNUW|5|Easy To Install.  Works Great.
B001DKT0DO|5|These little mirror are perfect.  I attached to my SUV and now I don't have to turn my head to change lanes.  I would recommend this product to anyone.
B00GW3E7C6|4|I had to tie the ends together as I could not remove my head rest to connect the straps.  They work great for what I want.
B00XPL88NC|5|I got this as a promotional item. This is a great product. Great professional quality.  This tire Guage is accurate and works good. The guage is big enough to read easy. I have used the cheap tire gauges in the past that were not accurate and they broke easily.
B003AZDLAI|5|love these
B008HXQR72|4|I just plugged it in for the first time, straight out of the box.  Worked for a split second then stopped?  Manufacturer stood behind the product.  Replaced under warranty. New one works as expected.
B005FN2F5U|4|It okey
B004QNW09Q|5|Worked great!
B00SP2OP9M|5|very nice for the price! Fit great!!!!
B007XWU54E|4|I installed it direct bolt on to factory CAT on my 99 civic ex everything was good the only thing that sucks is that I can't hang the exhaust on the hanews cause then it hits against my shifter and won't let me shift so I had to buy longer hangers and kind of touches little by little.
B000C9QI96|5|This was used to repair  a Jeep that had it's internal regulator (in the computer) fail.  The install took less than an hour and the battery is now being charged as it should.
B00FARYG12|1|Did not work with my 2003 Chevy had them installed by a shop and my truck was not ridding  smoother
B00150NNSA|3|Smells fine.. Does not last long enough to justify the cost. It is no better than any other air freshener out there. 3 stars as I see this as nothing more than an average device. Nothing special..
B00ONNFXZ2|1|Not the right factory color decals. They look like they been laying face up to the sun for three months. 😠
B00ZF6P6YY|3|This is nice, compact air pump. I want to use it for my Mazda Miata which has no spare and a pump with chemical solution to fix a leaking tire.  The insulation on the wiring of my Mazda supplied pump was worn in many spots and the Roypow was purchased to replace it. Granted, Mazda’s solution is not grand but space saving in a small trunk.<br />The Raypow will do a job to a limited level. Because of its size I would not attempt to pump up a complete tire, the pump would overheat and take an extraordinary amount of time with the many stops and cool down periods. Also, the pressure gage is not accurate and will have to be checked with a separate more accurate gage. Additionally, the electric wire connection to the cigarette lighter is short than on the Mazda Miata pump. In summary: the pump can top off the pressure in a tire and that is all.
B001OBIOCA|5|perfect delivery, fast<br />correct part and as described
B0002LBKG0|4|I like it but I find that there is an art to removing it while still allowing it to cure and get a good layer of protection. Seems to last forever but obviously your car will not glow like carnauba. Protection first with this product then shine.
B00E58JLL2|5|This  repalcement was too easy. This Dorman  third brake light installed easily. Three screws with Torx head and a plug in fitting. Once the old light was disconnected it was smooth sailing.<br />Seems that the  factory light assembly had the issue which others cite. The red cover on the original went missing but then again it is 2005 Mini.<br />The price on this part could not be beat. The same assembly went for $142 on an auto parts web site.
B0064IU5FW|5|Worked like a charm,had the earlier model Predator. This ones much easier to use.
B002OPWM3W|5|does the job works great
B007NYRKVS|5|so far so good.  Had them on my car for 4 days.  They arrived on time, and were exactly what I was looking for.  We shall see if they hold up.
B00PQZPMYI|1|If I was a contortionist I might be able to hook them up. Plus had to cut them to fit the head rest. Wasted my money.
B00NJYEVJU|5|Was just what I wanted to replace the dealership plate that was on my new car.
B00EPQVC2U|5|Cover fit my Honda 3 seater perfectly
B004MU8VRS|4|fit just like the old one.
B00AN5U00C|5|Yup - worked perfectly.
B006BDGDXI|4|Great product
B00T8M2OAU|3|I had to reorder passenger side due to the set I ordered did not have the key hole for the passenger side.
B00HEPH26O|3|have yet to install to my system
B00EHMR6F4|5|As advertised. No issues. Fit well. Work well. Price is great and were delivered well ahead of date specified.
B00AETG75E|5|These Cobalt steel wheels seem to be constantly bending (my wife has bent 3 of the 4 on our car).  This is a good OEM part which has served us well.
B00MYGA05S|5|Great quality and fit.
B007ZLNUEK|5|SO FAR SO GOOS GREAT PRICE..
B00J3ZNBQI|5|I loved it. Works fine.
B00A881BY8|4|Purchased for a 2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab.  I do not have a lot of experience with other types of tonneau covers so I can only comment about likes and dislikes with nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />Pros:  Installs relativity easily.  It appears to have a metal frame work. It has the aluminum sheeting under the vinyl cover so it will keep the honest people a little more honest.  It is light enough for a person to handle it on his own (but just barley) .  You can lock your tailgate and keep your stuff more safe.<br /><br />Cons: It is rectangular so it does not curve with the Late Ram 1500 bed especially at the tailgate. The hold down rail connector is made of plastic.  I am hoping it will hold up but in order to pull the cover down tight it seems to put a lot of pressure on this rail connector and it bends a lot when doing so.  I never did get it to come down well onto the tailgate so I made my own clip system with stainless sheet metal and a rubber snubby in the center back of the cover to pull it down in the back.  Does not come with detailed instructions.  Even though it is easy to figure out it comes with some thick rubber canopy foam strips and so I guess that if you cannot get the cover to come down good enough you are supposed to fill in the voids with this.  That would be pretty tacky though.<br /><br />Other thoughts:  Even with the cons I would probably purchase again because of the aluminum panels.  If the plastic rail connectors ever break I will make my own connectors out of metal for some good strength.
B001L1MGDG|5|Thank you love these bought to replace old ones that wore out over the years. Very satisfied .can't buy in stores in my area anymore
B00DSD6TWY|5|The sticker is a good tough item....i put this on a moped and was happy that it was a good size for a small moped and of tough quality. ..well stand up to the weather!!
B00JSDET98|5|:)
B003TTL0TE|5|Works great. Comfortable and doesn't fall off. Holds tons of water.  I'm not sure, but the fellows who had issues with theirs I believe received knock-offs or chinese copies (I don't know how that's even possible)  Mine works great and is holding up like new.
B00464FANI|2|Item described as a fit for my 2003 Nissan Murano; it wasn't.  Blade constructed of thick plastic which didn't allow it to flex and fit.
B00K832Q8S|5|Just as described!
B00AOTBVJQ|5|Absolutely the best flaring tool I have ever used. By fully surrounding the flare you hold every thing in place & if you use a cordless drill your  flare looks as good as factory work.
B00EK5CP5E|5|Look nice, easy installation
B00496U4ZW|5|Your truck came with these pads from the factory, and are worth getting if you're going to spend the time to change them.
B00QT1CCSM|5|As expectedly
B002UQYE1S|5|cute little plugs gives my SRX that extra cute kick
B00J7W7E9M|5|Works
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked well for what I needed it for..
B00B2A2RR6|5|Love it
B00OKYSWWU|4|This is a very heavy duty drop hitch! Even though I have a 21/2&#34; receiver I wanted a 2&#34; class V so I could add my bike rack with out removing the ball. The only thing I have seen was on inside the top hole it looked like rust was forming? I'm not sure if the powder coating could not reach the back corner on the inside or not. I am going to keep an eye on it to see if it continues or not. Over all its an awesome hitch and this was the best choice for me out there on the market.
B00KN1VX1Q|5|works great
B00MEVO5U4|5|All I can say is that I love love love them I have not lost not one
B00BUSIKQ2|4|Met expectation.
B00T7EN6MY|2|sheepskin material is good, but where the seams meet, it's a bit obstructive to the seatbelt movement, snagging here and there and bulking up in the internal velcro seals...
B0066TLNT6|5|Works great
B000S2SKIY|2|Wrong part
B006CRT72W|5|For $7.69, How can anyone complain?  These fobs used to cost $45-$85.  It's easy to program and use. Simple is the word.
B0002SRCYM|4|I like this tool it comes in handy for hood shock. I misplace my last one and the price here was a better.
B00AYVQ2ES|5|Winch was what I wanted. Cover for winch will not fit because it's made to cover an exposed winch. The winch mount I bought would not support the winch cover. Will sell. Installed winch mount and winch in 3 hours. Works great.
B007ZLNTLY|5|GREAT PRICE
B00CCIM1YQ|5|I love using this bike lock. It's probably the best heavy duty bike lock you can get for this price. No lock is 100% but this should deter a lot of crime and slow down anyone determined enough to get through. It can also be used for locking up many other things such as; bbqs, lawn mowers, edgers, or anything else you don't want someone walking off with.
B007G2IH4Q|2|returned it, good idea, just kind of cheap for the amount it cost
B00OVVEMVW|5|This car cover has me thoroughly impressed so far. It fits really well over my BMW, and as everyone has said it is very easy to take on and off. I live in South Texas and it gets hot. The last few weeks have been over a hundred degrees everyday, and the sun is scorching. The surface material is very UV and heat reflective. In fact, it deflects so much heat you can feel the heat being reflected onto you when you stand near the cover. Yet, it is cool underneath to the touch. I haven't had the chance to see how it performs in wet weather yet and we will have to see how it does in the sun here day after day. But for now, it is keeping my car cool inside and the leather from being super hot and cracking. I'll call that a success.
B008S8VUAA|3|This is a heavy duty wire stripper.  Model 4467 works a lot better however it is made of all plastic unlike this model.  Stripper does leave some teeth marks in the insulation after stripping
B00SJTPNSI|5|As described. Quick ship. Thanks.
B003TTTIOI|2|The O-ring in the cap does not provide a good seal. So it leaks fuel when you try and pour it.
B00ELBCSZY|5|Nice ,tough
B001JT1DI4|1|Doesn't even work...
B0034Y4WOE|5|great filter no complaints used multiple on my jeep
B00NAQUJ34|1|If I had to sum up this light in one word, it would be WOW. Ok, more like Freaking piece of crap!!  I got mine a couple of days ago.  after reading a few reviews, I wasn't expecting perfection.  i understand that its only $82, so am wiling to forgive some things.  But, WOW!!.  A few if the reviews mentioned loose screws, so I attempted to tighten the many loose screws on the face.  Yeah, sure.  The loose ones had stripped threads.  And most of the rest had stripped heads on the allen screws.  there were even a few that were cross threaded. Oh, and whoever put it together, left a big gouge out of the front.  Obviously, this company needs to hire somebody besides the not to talented monkeys they have to put together their products.  Oh, and maybe, hire a sober Quality Control department.  If you read this and decide to take a chance, you have been warned.
B009DJYPO6|5|right part right price, good quality
B00AZPP0Y6|4|Easy to mount, takes little amps, fairly bright, but not real wide. I tried mine at 10ft elevation and they work good for what I need.
B009I47BWO|5|Great quality, what else would you expect from BMW?
B000EH4V0Y|5|so easy to use and works just as you think, even has a mesh filter before it goes into the tube.
B004UQR1UM|5|Very sturdy construction. Does not look like it scratches the surface of the wheel. The true test will be in the winter salt and grime. Can't wait! Not.
B004NDPZCI|5|THIS IS MY SECOND ONE THE LOCK WERE YOU DRINK OUT OF BROKE AND SO GOT ANOTHER ONE . I LOVE IT!
B0046BFXD8|4|Good product
B000KKENBM|5|Very good quality!!!
B00DJ5KEEA|5|I have a classic car & I needed something to keep the battery charged.Perfect. I got the California rated because it uses less energy.<br />My battery is ready to all the time.
B000C15D4A|2|1st one i bought lasted 1 month, bought same one again and it works fine, going on 2 months wish me luck
B009LHER0M|5|Body shop quality!
B005TOLSBC|5|Item was just as described, it fit the circuit board perfectly.
B010OPGVL2|1|Hated this product, the brush was cheap and it left streaks that I thought might flow in but never did. Dry time to touch about one week, two weeks later if I leave dish soap on sink it will leave imprint. Would not recommend
B002798W9S|5|Great as advertised.
B0009PONKO|5|Fit perfectly on a suzuki vinson 500 4x4
B0047RV8WG|5|Great as advertised.
B00CZ46H7Y|5|WORKS TO PERFECTION
B00877SL2M|5|Great as advertised.
B000C59Y8C|5|Quality built made in America piece.
B005CO9Y9W|5|I had a slow leak on the low pressure side of my Honda Accord air conditioning system, and I didn't want to use some third world valve, so I went with Robinair. I have other Robinair products, such as gauges, and I like to stick with a known commodity. This valve did the trick, just like their other products that I have used. Stick with a winner!
B00GRHRTEU|4|I put these on my 2015 Wrangler. Initially on the lower set of mounting holes, had a constant whistling. Even with the doors off, it was annoying. Moved them to the upper set of mounting holes and no whistle at all, They hold their position due to the adjustable mounts on the back of the mirrors.
B00QMWQJRS|5|I was surprised how nice these are. I was looking for a quick fix until I could afford the real ones. For the price I did not expect much but I am impressed
B002PE95ZA|5|I've always used seafoam but figured I'd try this in our Audi TDI and I really can tell that this is a quality treatment made for a car like this.
B00A0RARCE|5|Does the job.  I was at a campground that has very low voltage.  The surge protector helped protect my equipment by shutting down when the voltage dropped below 100 volts.  Good thing to have if your camping in different places.
B00GMRM3KA|5|Just plain awesome compared to the original lights. Installed in Hummer H2. Had to cut the headlight buckets with a Dremel to clear the light heat sinks. It was an easy install.
B012X49QBY|5|This certainly gets the point across to people!
B0009VA8MK|5|Great look and feel to the material.. It fit perfectly in my 2004 Honda Accord EX. It gives your vehicle and stylish and luxurious look to it. I strongly recommend it if you want to protect your hood and front bumper from road scratches!
B00ZT5IDDW|5|Very nice cover for a vette key
B00LBMXSZK|4|Kind of a pain to install and you should be VERY sure when you make your cuts, otherwise you'll need to order another one!<br /><br />I highly recommend you view some of the good You Tube videos that are out there before embarking on putting this in. They were very helpful and kept me from making mistakes that I think I would have made otherwise. I'm not saying the instructions aren't accurate, but a picture is worth a thousand words and again you have to get this right the first time. Also, make sure you have a sharp cutting tool and that you cut straight across the rubber.<br /><br />Once you get the assembly together, it goes very smoothly from there. Installed, it's a super solid mount and 400 miles in I have had no problems whatsoever.
B006YBBZP8|5|Very nice mats!! They fit perfectly. Box was a little rough from UPS but the mats were fine.
B00AKYOOTO|1|Way overpriced. Buy from your local Nissan dealer if you can. You'll save a ton.
B00UL2M9PG|5|Very Good Product and very good price
B000RK8QP4|5|Good kit to have around the workshop.
B00IWLUFAE|5|Great fit, good quality, shipped fast!
B00OVW01YS|5|Lights work well, but I think the cargo lights should be focused like the reverse lights. They light the bed up okay but I would say not any brighter than the stock lights.  Will say these lights work 100 times better than others I've purchased.  Update:  Contacted the company and told them about the cargo light issues I was having.  Their customer service is outstanding!  I would highly recommend this company and I will buy from again.
B00LX28WAO|5|I have had these lights mounted under the bumper of my truck as back up lights for about 6 months now, and so far they work and they are bright.  Cant beat the price, would buy again.
B000GKD5PQ|5|Works perfect. Good quality
B005H53EPQ|5|I have them in my 1998 Jeep Cherokee and they are still working great almost 6 months later, excellent product for the price.
B00B2A271M|5|I have on my 2009 Mazda Tribute small SUV (FORD ESCAPE is the same thing)  my 8000K  Model# 9004 HID Kit for the total of $100CAD installed and I'm loving it, the view of the road is incredibl, but almost up to few too many times per night while driving I have people high beaming me thinking I'm driving with High beams and I have to turn them off so they can see my LED daytime running lights (AUDI) kind for them to stop and it really bothers me and I also know that it bothers them, as much I respect other people reactions I will NOT uninstall my lovely HID's-never, then I also noticed that other cars with HID like mine getting same reactions by other drivers and funny thing that most people that does that is people who drives factory installed HID or LED in their expensive cars-SUV's so I will highly recommend them to anyone who wants to see better at night and have a gorgeous look on their vehicles at night. One more thing I did is I have changed all my interior lights to LED's and its so much brighter inside the cabin when I need the light it's amazing once again I would recommend this to others as well it's not expensive and DIY for the total cost for me was $40 for about 16 light bulbs all different kinds, so before you buy make sure you know which ones you need.
B00199PMEK|5|Perfect fit on my 01 ford escape
B000JZIFZ8|4|just what i needed and at a much cheaper price then autozone, oreilys, and napa offered me and slightly cheaper then k&n officialy website
B0006U7XVS|4|quite a nice scent. wafts gradually from under my car seat
B000667QL4|1|I had high hopes for this product, due to the presence of at least some positive reviews. However, when I tested it upon arrival by filling it with ordinary tap water and hooking it directly to a brand-new and fully-charged marine battery, all it managed in thirty minutes was to generate a few tiny bubbles. At that point, I gave up as even a thirty-minute boil time starting with room-temperature water is completely unsatisfactory. (Imagine how long it might take with winter-chilled water that's been stored in a vehicle parked outdoors overnight!) I had hoped that the negative reviews might be due to old wiring, poor connections, etc. But every single component of my setup was brand spanking new, large-gauge and corrosion-free, and there was no shortage of power. Just a serious shortage of &#34;oomph&#34;.<br /><br />It's going back, with regrets. I really wanted this to work. Besides, I usually feel vaguely guilty when making a return. Not this time, though.
B001UCGPWO|4|It's quite good for the price,fits right in on my 03 Escape,a bit dusty though,not a bad buy overall.
B0063E6UJC|4|great price
B003CKDJ6M|4|Worked perfectly on my 2002 BMW K1200lt
B000CP86ZE|3|didnt seem to fix right onmy car....... but it looks ok
B001HL3S82|5|Perfect
B00KJGL1LM|5|I was able to have it cut by a local dealership. Programmed it in seconds. Works.
B008G22REQ|3|works great when towing, they shake/vibrate/move all the time
B000BZEIW0|5|it works, what else is there to know? can't remember if used the offset or straight socket but as long as the car is plenty hot you can get it off easy. my car is 2003 mitsubishi eclipse gt v6 3.0 liter and this sensor is the one that is nearest the firewall and accessible from the top left if you're standing in front of the engine. it's also left of the EGR valve and slightly to the right of the EGR sensor and slightly down, almost directly behind the MAP sensor and down a few inches.<br /><br />fuel economy will improve. i believe i used the offset.. it's a difficult area to get a tool into but i suspect either will do, might need ratchet with an extension and extension joint but you can get at it without removing anything
B000KKNAKM|5|thanks for the super fast shipping.  this fit my ins card perfectly.
B005BP3U2Y|5|Every car should come with one of these. Good to have in case of someone else being stuck in their vehicle too. Bought one for car and truck.
B00DMETQZG|5|I love them and they fit nicely.
B00L4OMPVI|5|Easy to apply and looks great.
B008DUU4SM|4|So far so good great product.
B000A0EINK|5|good ol' reliable Fram. Works perfect.
B00192JGDU|5|Big enough for cooking on, yet small enough to pack around. Two good qualities.
B000BPZ4X2|5|Fast shipping,it came marked with a punch in the four areas that needed to be drilled to fit my 1988 Toyota 22RE. Quality is perfect for it's use. It holds the MAF sensor that is all. I would recommend to those building an intake on the cheap.Will work for all Toyota pickup and 4runner 22REs.
B00NJ4YGLI|5|Super bright white light, used as fog light, brighter than my xenon headlights !!!! Awesome upgrade.
B004BTAJ2A|5|Very nice :) Thank you :)
B007CDYX7Y|5|My car loves it,  K&N is the best
B000N5JRBK|5|Great seller. Super fast shipping. After reading up on all the different systems out there, I decided to go with the Medallion. The exhaust sounds great, not too loud and the engine feels like it can breathe now. Makes the S2K sound and feel like it should have from the factory. Cant go wrong with the Medallion.
B0012TRFHO|5|This little thing is a gem for cable management.  It certainly changed the bird's nest of wire under my motorcycle's seat to a nice and neat layout.  Swapping out lines of LED's is much faster now too.  I chopped off the extra cable and soldered it to a remote control module (with built in fuse) and ran THAT to the power supply.  If you're running 3+ lines of LED's, get this.
B00PMXS7SM|5|Delivered on-time, packaged as described. Great product! Would buy again!
B00AX4TW98|2|Pretty decent for putting swirls in your glass. Not so much good at removing water marks. Maybe the issue was the pads I used which were the recommended groit's buffing/polishing pads. If you're looking to remove water marks then I'd look at other options.
B000PEPCGI|5|Really nice. You need this if you are doing body work on your car.
B00CAY9CG2|5|As described.
B00P1N8QU2|5|Love the towels.  They are perfect for any cleaning or drying job.  They wash nicely.  Perfect weight and size.  They are every bit as good as the old ones I had with the blue stripe.  I would buy them again, but won't have to for a while because they come 36 in a pack.
B0002SA442|5|Good quality, pretty solid material
B00HX9LK1E|5|Great Helmet, came faster than expected.  Comfortable and nice looking.
B008G22REQ|5|nitido
B00T0DS85M|5|Great extinguisher, but found the same thing for half price at Wallmart after I ordered.
B01191TYXM|4|Price  is great.<br />They do what they are supposed to do<br />Very happy
B004JAZZI4|5|fit well.
B007FSVWF2|1|This is a Vinyl not a sticker so it was useless for me.
B00AUFMFAS|4|Great product, stout, and easy install.  Better than OEM in my opinion.  The OEM flaps are so long they often get ripped off if you are doing any off-roading.  These are shorter.  Hardware (plastic push things) were not included.  I paid $14 at Toyota for hardware. Weathertech could have included hardware for pennies.
B00BKDFUTC|1|It is 2&#34;, it's reflective, but $5?!?!?!?!? What was I thinking?!?
B00D38VV36|5|Shipped Really Fast, Faster Than The Expected Date && They Are Way Cuter && Softer Than I Expected Them To Be!!!
B00VNBEFZ6|5|I purchased this set for my aftermarket headlamp assembly.  I was able to plug the bulbs in and get a nice bright light.  (so far I am a happy guy)  Unfortunately the fan housing of the bulb prevented me from being able to get the assembly back into its location. (Not a happy guy)  Needless to say I was disappointed.  This is by no means a fault of OPT7.<br />So why 5 stars, because the product is awesome, lights well, and the company stands by its product.<br />My return & refund were handled immediately.  So while I'm bummed that the bulbs didn't fit, I know by having seen the bulbs that the company produces a good quality product and they are not afraid to stand behind it.<br />For my next bulb purchase, I'll look to OPT7 first in hopes of getting a solution.
B00I3T6IZ6|5|Good deal.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Matched my car perfectly, great product!!!
B00EN3MJI6|5|Husband loved it! Holding up really well so far and shipping was quick!
B00KCQSM9S|5|Very nice looking seat covers, easy to install and can't beat the price
B007UHPSCG|3|It is made of a thin material and it is of the JUMBO SIZE.
B0044UQAKQ|4|larger than what I expected. exactly what was ordered. Can't find these at my local stores, better by far and longer lasting than liscole.
B000N5UE26|5|works great
B00N18N1LS|5|Exactly how it looks. Great quality
B0065WTNHI|5|A must have tool if you are going to be changing any clutch.
B00BTL8NDA|5|Great replacement part. It was the grey instead of black which was the color it should have been for my truck. So i sanded it down some and had it painted white like my truck before i put it on it looks great and really made it stand out.
B00CG5RYEW|1|Just a square sticker not a &#34;decal&#34; do not order this for your car!
B00SIX11VS|5|Work great and looks like they were made for my 63 ford.
B00OGN81DA|5|All I can say is......IT WAS PERFECT
B00SSMOS5U|5|Perfect fit, as described.  Along with the side window shields, it really keeps my car cool!
B00WTAZEXM|5|Just what was needed and easy to install
B000XBES4K|5|These plugs work great in my Sea Ray 180 Sport with a 3.0L Mercruiser.
B005GQVXC2|5|PERFECT, USE IT ALL THE TIME!
B00AMNKETW|5|Very Happy and Surprised with these rotors.  Every bit as good as the premium brands at a rock bottom price.  Went on without a hitch and work great.  Can't see a reason to spend more.  Well done Dura!
B000WJDX08|5|fit perfectly on my 2007 CRF 250X.
B0054HMF20|5|Just what the doctor ordered at a great savings
B00FGLZN3M|5|Good Service.  Genuine GM part
B000C2EDMC|5|Love It
B0024E6UE0|4|This works well, but slightly harder to put on than the other screens for the heater.
B00M9MQJL6|5|Good product, meet my expectations
B003FHLNVK|3|Does not reduce wind noise, increases fogging. It does install really easy though and it came pretty quickly.
B00KTIWD44|5|Works wonderful.  They include a piece of paper with a short website that not only gives you written directions on how to program the FOBs, but also shows a Youtube video on how to program them.
B0063GQP6S|5|I believe this will be a good long term fix.  I can say that I do feel a little more vibration in the driveline since I have installed this product though.
B007RRMVA6|5|Matched perfectly
B00CHDBXNQ|5|Perfect fit!!
B001PYO0AQ|5|The part bored up perfectly and has functioned properly since no problems
B00LULJIW4|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator
B00NO87MW4|5|Good quality and speedy service.
B001PLYWAM|5|Perfect for my Ham Radio Portable Solar Power Generator
B000N9L818|5|This is a good replacement for OEM.
B00NM6XWUE|3|-1 star not red (maroon color)<br />-1 star slow shipping
B00VU8O2MI|5|It fit perfectly and was brand new. Filled it up with coolant and have had no issues since.
B001DMDRUO|5|It works just as they said it would
B000EQRMTC|1|They squeal like crazy. Also there is a metallic grinding noise that is unsettling caused by the excessive of brake dust they create...
B00TB66CQ0|5|I have not had a chance to actually use them yet, but the quality looks great and just putting them on my old external frame backpack sholder straps, and sholdering it,  they feel great. Cant wait to actually do a 20 mile or better hiking trip and use them.
B00MH4663C|1|I ordered this battery because of the specifications shown.  Upon receiving the battery the AC charging connector would not fit into the charging slot.  It would fit into the output terminal...but that is NOT where you charge the battery from.  Returned battery and ordered the Antigravity battery...very pleased with it.
B000VVUF0S|5|Rack was perfect and looks great.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great gauge, well constructed and sturdy. I like the fact that it has been calibrated to ensure accuracy.
B00D9GVW72|4|Looks great on my bike!
B0044M2NWI|2|Not what I expected
B00JJBWMDO|5|perfect.. put it in your glovebox.
B000WOA4SW|5|Nice product, fit perfectly and now my lift gate works like new.
B00QIC7XW2|1|Product was smaller than what I anticipated.  It didn't matter because it was broken when I received it.  Not fixable or usable.  I only paid $6, so not worth the postage to send back.
B000B66UU2|4|Fit OK will see how long it last
B000CCIM1A|5|Great tool to have at the shop. Easy to use and compact. It delivers the amount of lubricant needed with precision.
B003ALQC3U|5|Delivered as promised, excellent .., all as promised, .price. quality and deliver.
B007G2KKAU|4|Nice quality for the  price.
B0091MH9E8|5|Actual product is fantastic. Not a &#34;cheapo&#34; sticker. Sticks great, doesn't lose its color. Worth it. LOL<br /><br />EDIT: I just want to update this because of the quality, even though Trump is president and this is 2017 (two years or so ago when I bought this), but I still have this on my car and it looks almost new.....
B00ULO0E0Q|5|It pretty cool
B003TTTIZ2|5|Great gas cans. I'll be buying more of them.
B000OUZA3S|5|great kit for our boat. have everything we needed for small repairs. recommend
B000C541OE|5|perfect fit good quality and greasable
B00DSD7554|3|Black rim around sticker &#34;fell off&#34;. The sticker is ok but not the best quality.
B010C8FAWW|5|Very Happy
B003BZCZZE|1|Next to impossible to pull &#34;quick release&#34; the product.
B005FNVXR6|5|Lowered my G8 GT just the right amount that I was looking for. They along with the PPV struts provide a nice and firm ride while not being harse.
B0096T8NDW|5|Worked out perfectly
B007DCRH9A|5|love it
B00R8OQOEM|4|They bright but they flicker
B008BU2I5G|5|Nice transaccion
B00BA1SWXA|5|Exactly what it says it is
B000NBKI7Q|5|This kit works great ! First if you have squealing noise it is most likely your tension pulley (this kit comes with one) if it still squeals it is something else period.  This kit is for keeping your belt on and it works great. my 1999 town country limited  belt came off every time it rained or I went over a bump or puddle. I tried shields and  everything else. I was convinced I was doomed. It is a defective design in the van. I tried the kit and now i go through water I should not go near over bumps rain etc. Everything in life should work this good.
B000CQ6DJO|5|Work great, recomend two per wheel/chain
B000LOGQ8K|5|It's heavy duty multi purpose hook...
B006X98A7C|5|Works like new again
B006ZSUR5O|5|Part went on vehicle, so ordered this brand, no issues so far. Good product, easy to install.
B00BJHS6TA|5|Terrific!  It keeps my water ice cold throughout the whole day.  Very sturdy and well made.  Thanks for an awesome product.
B000CIR15M|5|Fit very well on my Caravan 2005.
B00FJODH5M|5|This fits my car perfectly! I read a few reviews that said they had difficulty fitting it between the navigation console and the rear view mirror, but I have not had a problem with this. It is a bit heavy, but the thickness is probably why it keeps so much of the heat out of my car! If you drive a Mazda 3, I would definitely recommend this product!!!
B008AKN81K|3|Just something average, no big deal.  If you have a license plate holder on, they look bad.  You have to use them just on the license plate and looks cheap
B002ESXIOQ|4|It fit good
B00UONT2TS|5|GOOD
B0096U0NHA|5|Satisfied with my purchase. Met my expectations. Fast shipping from seller!
B00UONT7CA|5|good
B00K9Q4YAW|5|Great replacement for Garage door opener and alarm backup at a super price
B001AGSY9W|3|ok
B0093OY4L0|5|This looks awesome on our red 2015 Camaro ZL1
B00OT59K8A|5|Showed up exactly as described. Works great and easy to install.
B00EP02NHY|5|battery came on time, perfect fit for the busa with good power, so far so good!!
B000GU0MMU|5|works great!
B00T36HX5M|5|Great vacuum bag :)
B00R3LYF7S|5|it make my stuff organize in the car thank you
B00EC2C726|5|I never used ratcheting ties before and these were easy to use.  Held a kayak firmly to my compact car very firmly.
B00JPJVFMO|4|Great replacement
B00TQ07IOQ|5|wasn't sure what to expect very nice quality
B008RRX370|5|good stuff
B000CB7G5Y|5|Superb shock, I highly recommend this item.  They are already compressed so installation is easy (dont decompress or will take more time installing them).  The performance is of high level which results in a very steady ride..  Buy it!!!!!! OEM fit for trooper 95 Sport, single cam & double cam.  If the shock dont fit the metal holder just try to widen them as they bend inward with time.
B005OV5974|4|This lock adequately replaced the old worn out lock on a 2000 Saturn S 4-dr sedan.  This replacement is a fairly easy job.  You can code the new lock to match the original or code new for a new key.  I chose to code it as an exact replacement.
B002L7C3IC|4|Looks nice, but does not exactly fit grill of '03 Silverado.  Not enough curvature to fit properly.  I made it work, but could be better.  Made of metal, slightly glossy.  Maybe it fits the '06 style grills better?
B007IW6Z1Q|5|Fit perfectly on my 2008 Jetta. Easy 10 minute installation. From the outside it looks exactly like my factory tail light.  I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option because the description says it comes with the bulbs, which it doesn't. Not worth taking off a full star though. The bulbs are like $5 at Walmart for a 2 pack. I'll definitely buy this light again if the need ever arises.
B00K8NEBA4|5|Amazing quality! I wear a 13 so I ordered one size up (14) the largest size available and they fit great. Normally I am a 13 triple EEE wide foot.
B0068D3WLW|5|Received promptly , was an easy install, held hitch completely stable.
B00COYOXIA|4|I bought this to handle the extra flow volume that the Walbro fuel pump puts out on my WRX. The stock unit simply isn't able to keep up and as a result the fuel pressure runs 5-10 psi too high all the time. Install went okay but the FPR won't hold the fuel system prime. The stock unit didn't have this problem. I have a Defi fuel pressure gauge I use to monitor things.<br /><br />It will pressurize then quickly drop back down once the fuel pump finishes priming the system. This makes starting the car a bit tricky if I don't want to crank too much; your timing has to be matched with the end of fuel pump priming the system to get it to start after the usual 2 engine revolutions.<br /><br />Once the engine is running the FPR behaves as expected once I adjusted the idle pressure to where I need it.
B00FEXD65E|2|Came in mail fast. But really bent, disappointed. ...
B00HYK01A8|5|Thank you!
B0000AYBTO|1|JUNK
B007IWEQJ4|5|Awesome!
B001IH8Q0A|5|Heavy duty, works great
B00E90PQFG|5|Amazing levers for the price.  Easy to adjust, installed perfectly.  Shipping was pretty fast as well considering it had a long trip.
B006WBTKU2|5|Great!!
B00BX7K0JK|5|Excellent Buy! I always purchased k&n cold air intake systems before but seeing that the 14 impala dosen't have one out yet, figured I would give this a try and it has not disappointed!
B0014FGS6U|3|It came bent, as I was able to get only 4 out of 6 bolts screwed. Other did not align. I kept it as I use only for bike rack, so did not need to take loads
B009JRECG8|1|Do not buy. They are not durable. Flimsy plastic. They refused to give me a prepaid shipping label to return their product. Would not recommend this for anybody.
B002PUTC0M|5|I work at a busy shop and love this gauge for adjusting tire pressure. Easy to see display. Fills tires faster than my Milton gauge. Only thing that would make it better would be to turn the display sideways and make the head unit the size of the display area. Also would be nice to have an auto on feature. I've tried checking tires and forgot to turn it on first.
B001B5DCO4|5|Really great clutch best their is!
B0006305RY|5|Best fuel treatment on the market!
B004Z8B2SW|5|Works well on my four wheeler
B00SS8JRT6|5|Orthopedic back lumbar wedge support cushion . Wow I am so glad I bought this . It really help support my BACK. THANKS GODNESS. I would recommended. LOVE IT ,!!!
B000P72GKK|5|this is a very good product  never had any trouble with it.
B001AMGGK0|5|Boat is dry
B000HLU8IG|1|Very weak. Bent and broke off trailer first time I towed the trailer with this. Get something heavier duty.
B000KIPV42|5|This is used in our business and we expect is to serve it's purpose for a long time.
B001EOV45G|3|Looks kind of bulky compared to most receiver covers that slip inside the tube, so it makes the hitch more noticeable.  I would prefer the smaller one myself.
B007CTQEG6|5|Installed them on a custom tonneau cover and they work great.  You will need 13mm balls, nuts, and washers use these.
B00EECL90U|1|Can someone with a background in Automotives and BMW maintenance offer their opinion:<br />I have a 2006 BMW 330i.<br /><br />This amazon page says the D2S fits my car. It also says the D1S DOES NOT fit.<br /><br />I buy the D2S bulbs and take it into the mechanic.  Mechanic says the D2S DOES NOT fit the 2006 BMW 330i.  Also says I'll need D1S bulbs.
B00D6JTTTK|2|Doesn't fit toyota camry, are too small.
B004WCV1OG|5|Yankee candles are the best candles out there. I bought these hoping they'd be like there car jars and i wasn't disappointed. I only use 1 or 2 in my car at a time because the smell is strong. The mid summers night is one of my favorite scents
B00J9VORMI|5|Love, love, love them. They are a perfect fit. Would recommend.
B00N2BRC9G|4|Didn't seem as tall as described....good product
B000SNBSMI|4|This order came quick. Nice quality, light and not heavy or bulky. Easy to use and fits motorcycle perfectly. Draw strings in the bottom gives more protection and holds the cover snugly in place.
B000HS1356|5|What a fantastic cover, my bike actually fell over and this cover is so thick and comforting it actually prevented my bike from a lot of damage. Thank you!
B0007XUZIC|5|Fits perfectly. No rattling. Very good design. Love it!
B000SL4AA2|4|Working great so far! Used it 3 times. It is not super fast but it works.
B0000AY50X|5|Good Price, have used this cleaner/wax on my boat for years.  Works great for light oxidation.
B00IBPYC8C|5|better than I expected.  Very pleased
B00FH8P1DG|1|Half of rhe light will come on a go off the whole time you use it an its brand new
B002950DFG|5|Excellent quality.
B000EVN7W8|5|The best
B004GE598Y|1|great fit on the hard plastic part. the main problem is the built in hardware/bolts are too short to go through the bumper.<br />cannot thread the nuts (which by the way didn't come with the merchandise). would have been a good fit if the bolts are long enough to clear the bumper.
B00D9C2CDO|4|Worked as needed, stayed perfectly in place even with heavy winds on our + - 1,100 km (680 miles) journey.<br />Will definitely use again on family trips as it gave great space benefits in our Ford Ranger.
B001AY2WLU|5|I like it for ski bindings.  Small size big function. Mainly like the larger screwdriver tips
B004OK77L2|5|love it, no more cranking 30 foot camper., used it a dozen times already with no problem.
B004AR360K|5|It working good ,price okay ,I&#34;ll will buy more different item
B00T5G53ZM|5|I have avoided using the software on the CD that came with it. The free version of Torque on the Google Play Store is good enough for me.
B001DBVPNG|5|PERFECT
B00QN86Y94|5|Very pleased with the product and the swiftness in which it arrived. Now all need is the license plates to attach this to my partner and I new 2015 FORD Escape. Thank you.
B008LPBCBM|5|ordered this part for my fathers 1996 c280 mercedes and it fit and works perfectly!
B0006IX7WY|5|a must in a rv
B004SFZTJ0|1|I am not even going to bother putting these on my Blazer. They have zero compression and zero rebound. Total junk. I returned for a refund and am buying the AC Delco shocks that actually look like the picture, and have good reviews as well.
B00SA25KWI|5|Sweet, Looks Great on my Mustang!!!!, Thanks.
B0091UL4K0|3|did not fit well, but after some work and trimming I got them on and they are doing the job.
B0007VM99M|5|Work great on my 2015 F-250 Crew Cab
B00DSD6XYI|4|I'm not 100% sure this will stay. It's really cute, and vinyl, only time will tell. I love it!
B00MJZZ9A0|5|Good Quality
B004ZF35GM|2|gave me the wrong item.... didnt fit my car so i had to customize it myself... the only thing thats good is that it worked.....
B00BITIZWW|5|I own a 2002 Camry and the latch to open the door broke (cracked) and eventually I couldn't open the door from the inside anymore.  I found this and for $10 it's not a bad deal.  I looked up some youtube videos to see how to take it out.  I took the entire door panel off which to me seem a little easier in the long run.  You could just take out the latch/lock and hook the cables back up but I didn't think there would be enough slack in the cables to do that.  You can tell that the color is a little off by looking at the other door but not enough to really matter and all things like this fade over time.  Overall a great purchase and easier do-it-yourself kind of job.  Well worth the effort if you want to save youself some money.
B00XC1DCOK|1|I bought the Gigue mount charger and it never worked. It's the same product as this. It would get a connection for a couple seconds then disengage. It's very large and heavy too.  I tried to contact Gigue with the issue to see if I could get it replaced since it cost almost $40 and never worked properly. They contacted me back after a couple weeks to explain how to properly mount: &#34;push down until it connects. This was what I got after explaining how it never kept a connection. I think it's pretty evident how to push it securely into the connector. Thanks for the sarcasm. Would never buy any products from them regardless of what name they go under.
B00SNQ5J5Y|5|Was worried it wouldn't fit my seats, I have a 2015 Chrysler 200s...it was perfect. Love them!
B0006IX7YC|5|works very well
B0031ZDU62|4|Fit like ome no problem so far. A steal at the price I paid.
B0081SQY1W|1|OMG! I'm sorry but these thin covers can not stand the Texas heat!  Couldn't make it one week in the 100 degree weather, they warped and basically worthless after the first week...  I found a hard plastic cover that is GREAT and does not seem to be affected by the heat...
B0043IX1ZG|5|Perfect will order again
B004RU9RT4|1|Absolutely junk!!!  Tried putting the right hand glove on and it just tore like thick paper.  Don't waste your money!!
B000COCTXA|1|Doesn't fit 2009 Ford Focus.
B00HFSQ6BM|5|Helps but it is still a difficult task to get the emergency cable off of the brake shoe on a Saturn Ion.<br />All in all I am glad I have the tool.
B00WI0MX0U|3|This is a handy set to keep in the car for emergencies, but I do wish they are made from a higher quality material. I was at first very excited to try this set from Ford Motor Company because it not only comes with a knife but a multi use tool as well. I immediately thought of my car's emergency box in the trunk.<br /><br />They are heavy to hold but right away you can tell that they are not made from high quality materials. The knife is not too sharp but it does have a lock to hold it in place, plus a side clip for easier access. For a car emergency box, I think it does the job but I doubt you can get years of use out of it. The side clip is very cheap and I wouldn't suggest clipping it onto you as it seems like it could easily fall off. The multi-tool is also a little heavy but still made with the same quality of materials. Easy to open and close, plus there is a latch to secure in place. Again I think this is  great for a car emergency box and I really doubt you can get years of life from it.<br /><br />They do not take up to much room and easily can fit into a small side pocket of the mini backpack we keep in the trunk.
B00KTIQFU2|4|i like it but the metal inside that holds the battery popped out. I don't know how. one day it just stop working so i took it apart and relize that it did. was working for about a week before it happened. but hey its a knock off so i made me own fixes to it now it works fine.
B00A7YUIO2|5|Cleaned my coffee cup straws perfect
B004JBQ61S|5|Initially received the wrong liner but the vendor shipped me the correct one with no issues model # 40450 - (I will get the wrong one sent back ASAP.)<br /><br />Now on to the review!  I have a 2015 Kia Sorento with third row seats and I wanted a liner that would fit perfectly for my vehicle that took the concern away of spills etc., and this is perfect!  Now I can put my dogs in the back, or liquids, or plants etc. and not worry about what goes on back there! :-)
B0073UMCZQ|5|replace mine with this one and started right up on first crank
B000CINVA6|5|Good product. Everyone should have one.
B00684TAYY|5|arrived quickly, works like it's supposed to
B002NRH92K|5|Great product. Kids and adults enjoyed it
B009RY37AU|5|Nice set of gauges. Sturdy and works very well so far. Would definitely buy again.
B0040CU0JA|5|As described.
B004VNIS1U|5|I love it!!
B001DX5NMI|5|Great fit and look.  Now I can roll my windows down a bit during the day without worrying about rain getting in the car.
B000BPUTF0|5|Fit good!
B00KYX7QQY|5|Smells great and looks great too.
B000OCIRKO|5|Very good for touch-ups on my cloth car seats. Bristles are just a little stiffer than expected, but they work well.
B005H53BSQ|5|Great seller, very good product for the price
B000MX2ORM|5|I bought this for my 2000 Roadstar. The Roadstar has a massive engine and batteries are really taxed by the cranking requirements of starting the beast. This battery was bought for the high cranking amps. Have had it on the bike for awhile and have taken numerous trips including a recent 5 day 2000 mile trip. No problems. And I never even think about the battery anymore - so that speaks for itself.
B00LNJI1KI|5|Amazing product for the price. Will not find a better deal. came with the mounting hardware and performs exactly as you would expect
B007EA6PS0|1|The buckle on the stabilizer strap broke the first time I used it.  I  called Curt and they said I had to go through Amazon.  I cannot find how to contact Amazon to get the strap replced without returning the whole item?  Update:  Never heard back from anyone regarding my issue.  I used a strap from another bike carrier I had, spent another $15 on bolts, lock washers, pins to make the carrier usable.  If I can re-engineer the carrier to make it work why can't the &#34;experts&#34; figure it out?
B004SG51FQ|5|good
B00SVKSF80|5|Perfect for my project!
B0002U2V1O|5|Great product.
B007V2E7XG|5|Perfect fit
B0066TQ0US|4|It worked fine
B000FGCYT4|5|Great product. Fast delivery.
B00XVZYTLM|5|I bought these LED bulbs to see if they made a difference from the regular lights that go in the travel trailer...<br />BIG difference I love the lighting much better will only use LED now. Others in the park are now wanting to change their's to LED.
B008WFPCDA|4|Quality is not the best, but look good overall
B003WOZOUM|5|Perfect for a KIA Soul.  My daughter had to move her belongings cross country when she graduated college.  This was the easiest and least expensive solution.  The kit came with the straps and hardware to fit in door frame. Installation was easy.  We did purchase the mat as recommended.  There was a bit of road noise but she traveled the 2700 miles safely without incident.
B003EUXINO|1|NOT PLUG AND PLAY!!! These suck and their customer service is no better. Video online is not for these lights and customer service had me cut and splice factory harness a few times and still hyper flashing. Pure junk in my book and going in the trash but I am still left with my factory harness all cut up and hacked by the directions of their customer service rep.
B0041TU7AE|5|Perfect
B006X8B1DI|5|Awesome and it looks great on my husbands truck! He loves it!
B00CMY1OFM|5|Item was exactly as described. Nice looking and works great.
B00A1A6PT4|5|Works good and does the job nicely!
B00E0OSDPQ|4|well made
B0001L0DFA|5|Love these hose nozzles.  They are made out of the same materials as fire department hoses and do not break if they are dropped. I have four of them-- one for each spiggot.  One of mine developed a leak and the company's warranty policy is terrific if you need to call them.  I love the adjustable head with an off position in either direction. You can spray gardens from much farther away than you can with other nozzles.  I have seen people looking at hose nozzles in hardware and big box stores. I advise them to go to A azon and buy a Bonaire nozzle.  Looks like they make an awesome product for washing cars also.
B0026Y81K4|5|fir great just what I wantred
B000JZZR3G|5|I bought a very well used 2002 Ram 1500 pickup with an amazingly loud 4.7 v8. Installed the Walker muffler, extension pipe, and tailpipe - - and I now have an amazingly quiet 2002 Ram 1500 pickup. Excellent.
B00079Y7RQ|5|Excellent jacket and excellent price also. Not too thick and very easy to sew the patches.
B0097YH972|5|Easy to install on my Goldwing.  Great to hold drinks when on long trips
B00PEZOK48|5|These look and feel great on my car. They were the perfect size for the spot I wanted them to go.
B00KIQ68WU|4|Easy to use and cleaned and protected the tonneau top.
B00BTLEHSK|2|If you have a subaru wagon, the back seat's back cover cannot wrap around.
B00KTL834K|5|Thank you & 5 stars
B00GFU05KE|5|5stars
B00K4N8802|5|Looks great on my keychain. Nice quality. Be prepared to constantly clean the white parts as it gets dirty very easily.
B007CMQ986|2|The rack is not as pictured, but it looks nice.  However, it was shipped with spacers and long screws which were required because the rack is narrower than the backrest where it attaches.  All the weight will be supported by the four screws.  Of most concern is that the rack has a label attached to it which states that the maximum load is six pounds!!  Not very helpful.  I am going to see how it works, but if it does not hold my bag well, then I will be returning it.
B00DMG104E|4|I like this charger and it is overkill for my volt. Nice long charging wire but it is a bit of a snug fit in my 2013 volt's charging port. That's probably by design but like I said it's definately more snug than the OEM 120v charger. It's inside my garage so I can't comment on it's weather rating, etc. It was an easy install (I wired in a 240v appliance plug and plug it into a NEMA-rated 240v outlet I ran up to my garage. Overall I can't complain and have made use of the faster charging hundreds of times in the last year. Although it probably won't pay for itself for a year or two more with the low price of gas it's been fantastic putting upwards of 70-100 miles/day on battery. Give yourself a little flexability and mount it next to an outlet with an appliance cord.
B006TAF7I0|4|Great to have in the truck.  The shorter 3 ft rope works great with the longer one in order to get things tied down just right!
B0002U1TX0|5|Love it lasts about a month. I use it over Klasse Sealant.
B004O844EM|5|Awesome!
B00CQD4CM6|5|Works like a charm,OEM wasn't good at all.
B00FKHKQ0W|5|fit perfectly
B0031I4HN4|5|Great, parts work well and priced very well, quality parts
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works as intended.
B000EDUUGM|2|Purchased for our new RV... fit in the sink... but the rubber adjustment fall out while traveling.  Lost one nut down the sink.  Over tighten another and broke the board... so that one no longer works.  With the 2 adjustment missing - doesn't stay in place on the sink.  If you do get this - before you head the road - put locking nuts on so you won't lose the nuts or over tighten and break the board.... like I did.  Would not buy again.
B005VVEORI|4|This is, in fact, an original OEM part.  If the rocker panels on your Cherokee haven't rotted out already, they probably will some day.  Its a clear design flaw on an awesome vehicle.  You will find a wide range of aftermarket rocker panels available on the internet, but all of them are crude stampings with poor dimensions (I have purchased two such sets and been disappointed).  If you're looking for a crude rocker panel to weld on to your rock crawler, buy an aftermarket part or make one out of sheet metal.  However, if you want to restore your Cherokee to factory condition, you absolutely need this part.  Amazon is one of the only places I have seen it offered, and I'm pretty sure Chrysler isn't making them anymore, so snatch them up now!
B003SU0WE8|5|Great looking Mat! It's big and totally shows my Dallas Cowboys passion at the front door.
B00R244UVC|1|product far too thin & runs easily, doesn't adhere well to surface either.<br />I used it along with plastidip and could tell the difference in the viscosity between the two just by shaking the cans.<br />Don't bother with experimenting go with plastidip & save yourself the $ & disappointment.
B00M78820I|5|Used my Car Sun Shade for the first time yesterday.  My car sat for 3 hours in approximately 106 degree heat and I was able to get into a comfortable car and drive away.  I had watched the videos on folding up the Car Sun Shade and although I didn't quite use the methods shown, it was easy to fold up while sitting in my car.  Really good product!
B0082365AQ|5|Love this little cart. Lets my wife and I get back into 13th lake and other Adirondack's. Only bad this is the strap,  it should be a ratcheting strap.
B002G3OG6S|5|Saved over buying this set at dealer ($140 installed). Awesome buy, wipe more smoothly than cheaper blades.
B0062WC9ZO|5|Arrived a day after scheduled delivery date, who knows why.. Arrived brand new, easy to install, and worked great!!
B00DSZD8L2|1|Returned, did not fit rims. Never heard back, not even sure if money was returned.
B00X5EO6VC|5|Arrived as promised I am totally satisfied.
B00EKTJ56C|5|Looks Great
B000WJWTM6|5|Shims, they are what was ordered.
B000C57L7I|5|Fit my 2007 town and country van just like original equipment. Good ride easy to replace.
B003PJOEXM|4|good value. the provided wire used to fish the bolt through the frame is too short. but other than that it bolted up just fine.
B004GCS7GC|5|Nice looking mirror,, fit right up,, five minute install. looks so good,I may just buy drivers side so they match. For sure better than paying over 150 at the stealership
B00VU8FGHI|4|Nice product... Holes doesnt align perfect but will work...
B003LF8MTC|5|Perfect for my Lara Croft costume :)
B0016LG0CY|3|This product seems nice, upon first look through. I actually had to run to an auto parts store because this product doesn't have any leadsdoes not work (without leads) with the underglowLED 4 Piece Multi color interior under dash light kit. So that was a small waste of time but once I got over that speed bump, I hooked everything up, plugged it in and it worked perfectly... For about 30 seconds and then blew. I then took out the fuse and replaced it with a stronger ten amp fuse. Again, it worked for less than a minute and blew again. At that point I gave up and contacted Amazon and got a refund. Overall, nice quality product except the fuse.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good quality<br />Cheap<br />Green LED to show its working<br />Easy to reach the fuse (unscrew cap)<br /><br />Cons:<br />doesn't work with suggested product (said above)<br />Weak fuse<br />No leads
B00M9NU830|5|The very best money I have spent for my lease of 17 years
B000C2WDK6|5|All good
B000EDOTCS|5|Love the detachment feature. Works great
B0038KNJQ6|2|dind have enough force
B00CFQT5YO|4|I would have gave it one more star, but it cost me a little more to install, was impressed that the instructions were included, but they left out a very important item that it didn't include a orifice which is dropped in the lower fitting before hooked up. Took almost 2 hrs. to install on a 92 S-10, had one side loose and took a dremel cut top off case and it came right out and new one slipped right in and used a good adhesive to case and done. Good luck.
B00WXNFVLU|2|Cheaply made and fragile.  Not worth the price.
B004C24H2O|5|Fit and look great. Easy installation. Fast shipping and look and work great on the bike.
B00L8417NQ|1|These do not fit a 2000 BMW M5 as stated in description.
B007LIHXH2|5|Fit my trailer fine.  Just what I was looking for.
B00HTP8N0I|3|Straps are very short. Would it have killed the manufacturer to make them a couple of inches longer, so that I could've actually used them? I bought them to loop over the lower fork bridge on my motorcycle, so that I could secure the bike to my trailer using ratchet straps. These straps were so short that I really had trouble making them work. Cheap, cheap, cheap on the part of the manufacturer
B001SIFILE|3|Not bad but the pins start to fall apart after some time.
B005ZOXYHW|5|good
B00YEEOCGQ|4|Got it on time, but the hardware really two long bolts but no nuts to it and other bolts different sizes and one nut are you kidding me. The bar itself looks great and will mount on my bike, I will get other bolts and nuts.
B00AET00YI|5|Exactly as expected. Applied with soapy water, adjusted, then squeegeed smooth.
B003ALQC3U|5|Exactly what I needed to replace in my 5th wheel.  Simple plug and play unit that I was able to install by myself.
B002PUTC0M|4|Don't like the design of the back screws to get to the battery
B00424M3VE|5|Excellent product and fit. Buy here!
B000F5HUUI|3|The tool works.  Does the job.  But the crank handle can tear your hands up.  Developed blisters on my thumbs through use of this tool.  But like I said it works it's just.... not ideal.
B00FADJ06C|5|Perfect fit, great price, easy install! Would highly recommend!
B001T9MCK2|5|Fit perfect. 01 bmw x5
B0083G3AXC|5|Bought two of these and am very happy with them. We use them almost daily when outside.
B005JU5UEW|5|awesome wiper blades!
B00PQMHHW6|5|Shipped really quick and went on my motorcycle hitch mount trailer flawlessly.  Very good adhesive.
B00H1IBKIK|3|Match lug nut size for dodge caravan, but are not design for dodge caravan to hold up wheel cover.
B004VTF222|5|VERY NICE LIGHTS....... THEY WORK GREAT.........AND LOOK AMAZING.....AND SHIPMENT WAS FAST. ....WELL WORTH THE MONEY. .......VERY BRIGHT LED'S!!!!!!
B00B2YHFO2|5|Nice bright, white light.  Fits the cargo area of my trailblazer ss.
B00NOL6RSG|5|I wonder what the difference is between these lights and other lights at a far greater price. These are extreme bright like the others. The patterns are also great and the installation was hassle free. What more can a guy expect? But just don’t keep putting it on and off your dashboard. That’s all.
B000NW4PJC|5|very pleased
B00VR8AA2W|2|Love how it says kids and not just baby. However it looks like it was printed at home and the ink was low.
B008J1OTUO|5|I felt so happy when the leaf blower  got started .I am very happy now.v
B0045WBVUM|5|Rode 690 miles using this. My butt still thanks me for this. Using it now on my cbr 250r.
B006MX8196|3|Fit is sloppy, no way to make them look good. The back seat covers fit really bad. Do not recommend.
B004TIWCL4|4|Good quality and still good after a year.
B00AMS22LK|4|Came ver fast, good looking, definitely have to drill/make adjustments to get it to fit correctly, but the directions said to expect that, so they delivered on everything they promised.
B003COTFS4|1|I bought this winch bc it had great reviews and the price was great. I put this on a Honda pioneer 700-4. We installed last week with ease and used it this past weekend not only would it not pull out the sxs but it would not pull out my 450 foreman.  The no name cheap 2000 lb winch on 4 wheeler did better. The winch looks great and is easy to install. The first thing we thought was that we just needed a bigger winch for the sxs ( weights 1395) but when it didn't pull the foreman out we lost faith in it. Not only did it not pull but after a few minutes it overheated and stopped working so you had to wait and try again, after one weekend of use we are buying a different winch. We are going to get the 4500 lb kfi. We were in thick heavy river bottom mud , so I don't know if everyone on here is riding  in easier conditions or if I just got a bad winch but this is my first and last experience with super winch.  I am going to post 2 of the holes it would NOT winch us out of and yes we had the foreman winch connected to a SOLID tree trying to pull the sxs on the other pic we actually had to use our Silverado to pull the foreman out bc no trees close enough and the super winch kept getting overheated.  Like I said maybe it was just to heavy of mud for this winch but we will be trying a different  brand.  I hate to leave a bad review but Hope this helps someone understand what this winch can and can't do for you.
B00R8OMIBK|3|Although they look amazing in my car, the box was missing a couple screws. Also they are very flimsy. It's made with cheap plastic and could come apart if lightly pulled. It was easy to install but the provided kit is a universal one and does not include enough wire. Make sure you pick some up before installing. Costs 8 bucks at autozone. Shipping was relatively fast though. Not horrible for the money but save it and put it towards a nicer pair
B00J1BUO32|5|Bought it for a 2012 Jeep sold it.  And it fits very well on the 2015.
B00306YESK|3|tight fit should be larger
B009DK39G0|1|Did not fit missing a section
B0058E46LC|5|Fit perfectly on a 2006 suzuki vinson 500 4x4
B00DSD57S6|4|Slightly peels off when debris from a tree or something falls onto my car and onto him, but you can just roll him back up and be fine. I like having the gang on my back window!
B008Y976U6|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B00LGKM8RQ|5|Works great
B003BZCZZE|5|Great quick disconnect
B0007VF9Z8|5|This bumper took maybe 30 minutes to mount on a '97 F250.  It looks good and I've had no problems with it.
B00PKR9IBU|5|A+++
B000MUOPNG|5|These push pins fit the underbody of the 2010 Prius perfectly, for holding on the plastic splash shield (see caveat below).  Excellent purchase, highly reccomended.<br /><br />IMPORANT!!!!<br />The Prius uses TWO sizes of push pins!! These pins fit the small holes perfectly.  However there are a few LARGER holes where a pin needs to  go through multiple layers of plastic, and those requires a larger push-pin fastener.  Amazon sells these push-pins which I use to fit the LARGER holes perfectly: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008427D88?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00
B000MCXP2G|5|Excellent little oil can.  I do recomment.
B003VAWYRS|5|very handy with strong bristles
B00TKXHGHS|5|I'm in love with my lightsssss , the aftermarket are way better than the factory bulbs
B001G7IHPG|5|good
B008G3J9P0|5|Great parts
B008C00K8M|4|Good fit and finish. Giving it 4 stars because the instruction pictures are blurry, and I did not notice any improvement in power.
B00029J3U2|5|ok
B007Y5745S|3|Get the more expensive one.  It doesn't cover edge to edge on my 2013 Optima.
B0026CG5S6|1|perfect fit , great product , fast ship
B00BFDJ9QM|5|OEM as advertized
B00E1SPD2M|5|Good quality
B00KY08HLA|3|Can't say much about the quality because I never installed it.  It looks identical to my OEM alternator however, with the exception of the connector.<br />This one has a 3 - prong connector, my 1997 Civic EX 1.6L V-tec has a 4 prong connector.  Maybe there are two different alternators for this car, but the Amazon fitment guide said it fits, but it does not.  You can easily (now) see in the picture that it is a 3 - prong, however at the time I bought this there was only one pic of the front side of the alternator.  It was a shame because it was a great price and I had to return it and then just drive to Advance Auto to pay $30 more.
B007HGF398|5|Nice looking. Easy installation!
B002UDXL4C|5|As described.  Not insulated, so the cap and can are the same temperature as the fluid.
B003CMWC4U|5|This is a crucial tool when cleaning the later model Honda carbs.  The fuel mixture/pilot screw has been designed so it is more difficult to adjust from the factory.  This socket allows for removal for cleaning and accurate adjustment.  This tool worked perfect for removing the the pilot/fuel mixture screw on my son's CRF100 and it runs like a champ now.  Be aware of the spring and tiny o-ring that come out with the screw, The O-ring was stuck in ours and wasn't found until the second time I had it apart.  Now the bike runs like new.
B00QMTAZ1W|5|good
B00BZSE5CK|4|works ok with my Jeep Cherokee 2015
B00EI6CKVE|5|:)
B000FW2MCM|2|ran engine with AC, used the adjustments for N/S & E/W...lined up for North, but dumb dirtyword cotton--picking nose-sucking gator-bait<br />was still 25 Degrees off.  finally just moved it around my dash until it indicated North, then secured it at that position.  just checked it this A.M. after I moved my truck  and my<br />truck is pointing close to SW, but the dumb dirtyword compass is pointing NW.......sheeeeesh.........definitely NOT worth the money nor the<br />time/aggravation.  I will lose on this, but I will NOT buy or recommend thjs product.
B000E3EXD8|2|Did not fit over seatbelt
B00A8MZ7IA|4|Great microfiber towels. Much better quality than the &#34;thin&#34; microfiber sold in bulk at the local auto parts shop. Havent washed them yet, but have been great thus far. Shines the car nicely!
B005EMOPU0|5|Great. The part came earlier than expected and fit perfectly. No slack and issues with tension, no clicking noise. Perfect. Good as new!
B00REXL1DQ|5|Boy howdy these are bright. They do make my car look like a morgue though, as they put out a very cold white light. Keep that in mind.
B0094FYSBO|5|They look great! I love them :)
B00DNGFRC4|5|Easy to install and look great
B00U5IFK70|1|I ordered this in camouflage (tree) and it came in red, was very disappointed that I spent $40 on this.
B005S8KO8W|5|Product was good quality and worked perfect. Installation was a breeze.
B008EEYTRE|5|Fabulous.
B00Z8F2UA0|5|I had never used one of these car wash mitts before and I will never was a car without one again. I also found it the *perfect* tool to clean my specialized stump jumper mountain bike because you don't want to spray a bike with too high of a pressure (eg hose) and you can just dip the glove in suds and &#34;finger clean&#34; all the hard to get too areas around the suspension linkage. sweet.
B00JVHLS3G|4|Great product - will be ordering another one!
B00651CFEW|2|Pretty disappointed by this antenna.  It starts bending at 35 mph and goes full flaccid at 60 mph and above, I also lost my HD radio with it.  Not recommended.
B002UQRXNY|5|Love these, they look great on my tires. Thank you.
B00HRXSYWE|5|Exactly what I needed. Quick shipment.
B00AOA7HZC|5|Fit my car very good
B00CDGNX26|5|Earlier than estimate for delivery. All 3 worked great.
B00EAOIRDO|5|Good Deal
B003SJJRG8|5|So far it's working fine or great. Can't beat the price for the same product sold and your local part store. Only one thing I didn't like is it squeaked a lot after a few days Nothing a little lubricant couldn't solve.
B000C2CN5Q|5|Great for my Mazda Tribute 2003.
B009PQGDNI|5|My previous cap was missing and my computer was throwing a &#34;bank 1 too lean&#34; code, adding this cap quickly solved the problem and gave me piece of mind about covering the engine again.<br /><br />Looks exactly like the original cap and fits perfectly. Does what it is designed to do.
B000M3V95U|5|This is the best-- no streaking and doesn't leave a film to show up later
B00EEJMEQ6|5|Easy install. Worked great
B00TD157HI|2|Not to complain, however.  The 86 folks that gave these towels five stars must work for the company.  I have purchased a package of 20 towels at home depot of the same quality.  These are the towels you use for cleaning your wheels and then tossing.<br /><br />Very surprised.
B00E7VFL8E|4|Overall decent product. I bought this item for my 2014 dart. Other than a little strip of the door handle that you can see due to this product not being perfectly sized, I can't complain. I've only had them on for a couple of days now, but so far the tape is holding up fine.
B00H9Z3FVU|5|Works perfect
B00EVMT6A8|5|Thanks
B00EI6CKVE|1|First off, the sticker was sent in a pink envelope, which was not professional at all. Secondly, the sticker was almost already peeling off of a blue type of paper that it was on. The sticker was also cut lopsided, which caused me to fix it myself. I cleaned my window off, put the sticker on and guess what? It didn't even last 3 days without getting bubbles and dirt underneath it. Don't waste your $2.95. I really loved the design and thought it would last but it didn't.
B00IA7P47E|5|Very nice look! And thanks for asking.😄
B000BYB7VG|4|OE part for my 2003 Ford Ranger, my only issue is that the wires were not numbered, 1 through 6 as were the original wires.
B006FUT09G|5|Excellent product
B00801RSIS|4|went in easily without help from someone else. excellent ride quality as well.
B000E3V9WQ|5|Great product, nice looking and sturdy.
B0069EYI7M|5|Terrific, very high quality
B0041THIII|4|does not blow as hard as the OEM one, but at the price it works good enough in my 2006 jetta
B00KWDI80O|5|Excelent
B002JR949K|5|Great product!  Highly recommended.
B00BITLPSS|4|Exactly what I expected, perfect factory fit. There are some things you have to take off your old cylinders when replacing:<br />- Return spring - this is pretty easy to swap out with needlenose pliers<br />- The rubber grommet/seal that goes between the outer rim of the cylinder and the door<br />- The plastic end catchpiece that hooks to the metal door latch. You'll see it when you get there.<br /><br />There's a little C clip that can be tricky to take off, but with a small screwdriver, it will be fine. Also worth noting is that if you're looking to re-key this, the outer rim is really great for removing and re-sealing the cylinder itself.
B00252GGM2|5|Much better than the cheapest filter from autozone; Provides the white fuzzy material on the filter that is the same as the one that comes from the factory.
B008H50I7U|5|I used this sticker on a Pelican case and was very satisfied.  It's a great example of the classic &#34;rampant colt&#34; that is over a hundred years old.
B000B8N3MS|5|cheap and fits my car like it said it would!
B0033YHRHE|5|works great
B00DJ5KEEA|5|This product seems to be as advertised. It was easy to connect to the car battery and keep the battery charged in the summer. We will see how it works this winter. I did blow the fuse by connecting it to the 110 volt power before it was connected to the battery. That was my fault. It was easy to replace the fuse and then it worked perfectly. If I was making one of these I would extend the length of the cable with the ring connectors to make it easier to use in a long term application.
B00ANWV43M|1|Followed guidelines and entered make and model of car.  They did not fit and to get a refund I would need to pay to ship them back, buyer beware.
B000GKAZMW|3|Good
B00UJ62GU2|5|This scanner works great on my Chevy Silverado 1500. I use it to erase the check engine light and it save me $90. I think everyone should have one.
B000CZ2XI0|4|Good price, eazy to install
B00JINPJD8|5|works great
B000BGJWA2|4|Met the need just fine.
B002GZ6VVY|3|Three stars because they are not very blue. They are but not much. They are also not very bright.
B005R4L29W|5|Great look and great fit.
B009PJ2B9U|1|Not really feeling any difference. No extra throttle response. No extra horse power. NOT  a gas save at all. Pretty useless. Can't even hear any difference
B00FZGN5UQ|5|Nice simple transaction.  Received the part I needed in a timely fashion.  No complaints and will use them again.
B00FWLFFJS|4|they fit nicely over my glasses.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Great battery...works perfectly
B00NASRFUM|5|Great Product and great service..
B008MFBG58|5|It was perfect!
B0095Y5OKI|5|Works as described
B000M5W25E|1|Wrong size, for my 07 Avalanche,
B00EQ9A1D2|1|Mfj-266 is total junk Bought one and the power button went bad in less then 10 hours use.
B0042VNBP4|3|a
B008CE0W5Y|4|The lights are good.  They are easy to install and bright.  Throw away the wiring harness that comes with them, it is junk.  The ground connection inside the connector opened within 2000 miles.
B00MY3H3RY|5|Good items!
B009S94NX4|3|These are much more like a chrome color - on here they look much darker than they are.
B0090ZJPMK|4|Works with most not all BT devices.<br />It interfaces with the car computer well.
B0043AV4NK|5|Love the sound of it on my 07 g5 has a deep tone to
B00FB0UYQE|5|Good fit, good price
B000C9ISI0|1|Had it installed and it ran for about 4 days just fine.  Then I noticed what sounded like a turbine on a cold start.  Call to GM basically told me I'm screwed because it didn't come from the dealer, and the dealer didn't install it so no warranty?  Really?  Definitely not right.  Had it removed again and got one from the stealership and it seems to be fine now.  Couldn't wait for days for a return so paid the higher price but oh well.  Good thing amazon let me return it as I was within my 30 days or I would have been very unhappy.
B000EG46BO|5|smoother performance
B00RW4LL6O|5|Perfect
B0030VF61E|5|Fit my 1992 Jeep Cherokee 4-door well.  My original weather strips were cracked and I found evidence that the doors were holding water when I took them apart.  Hopefully, replacing this seal will help.  Just to clarify, this is the outside window seal on the bottom edge of the window for the front doors.
B00KQ3WR1G|2|Maybe I didn't do it right, but extending the ramps to full size seemed way too hard for one person - apparently it must be at least two, one for each end to press the release buttons. Once extended works fine.
B00AETUVM4|5|Works very well.
B000CPI87U|5|fit great.... Nice upgrade from the regular rubber bushings
B0026CE6QO|5|Nice product
B00KWMG4A6|3|I dont usually give reviews on stuff i buy here but this is the first order where it broke when i took it out of the packaging by tears in the front lining and someone down the middle, these are good matts but i wish hhey were just a little bit more durable
B00H3TMEZU|5|Great item and great price! It perfectly fits my 2015 GMC Acadia.
B001O03AKM|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B003CG9PIC|5|Good pulley
B000C9NPBA|5|exactly as described, excellent price
B000HCRF0Y|5|Fit fine. Bad smell in car went away
B000CO86BY|4|They held my car up while I worked on my car for a brake job. I couldn't expect for more. They were secure and easy to use - but really, how hard is it to use jack stands?
B0026RQE5K|5|just like originals.... Fit and finish are awesome!!!
B000CFQIL8|5|Great quality!
B0009ZEVLU|1|Still I have the wrong filter , I need to get this replaced
B00120LVDC|5|Fixed my issue
B00K9ORZZA|5|Easy to use, shipped fast.
B00NC8UABQ|5|Easy to install four bolts and done.
B00ORPGI0K|5|Very Very Light! I typically wear an Arai but this Helmet fit my head great.
B010F66C96|1|There should be BIG LETTERS under this bumper sticker signifying how SMALL it is.  Had I known it was half the length of your standard bumper sticker, I would not of bought it!  Not worth my time to send it back now --- spent a lot of time trying to get it out of the brake light dent in my back window, --- where it got stuck due to it's miniature size!
B0039YGZDK|5|As advertised, worked perfect for the job I ordered it for.
B00NUDGDM8|4|Easy to install. It comes with a number of screw-in adapters. It mounted easily in the socket of the old antenna and seems to work well. I haven't noticed any problems with reception. It doesn't interfere with kayaks mounted on my trucks roof rack.
B004GE94T4|5|This was an exact match to the factory original for a 1/3 of the price. Came painted too. Excellent buy.
B003D4KA32|4|Exactly as pictured, Good quality, Fits well.
B0000BYQ8U|5|works amazingly well, husband can safely watch me ski behind both sides of boat
B005N53AM2|5|Love this!  Very easy to put on the steering wheel.  Seems very sturdy.
B002N5W8Q4|3|This thing rattles to no end and so can be heard throughout the night :-(
B009DK6FVQ|5|look great
B000C08ZVE|5|Great as advertised.
B00G2U0LHY|5|I ordered two sets of these bulbs, one set for my tail/brake lights and one for my reverse lights. I was skeptical about the dual filament aspect of these bulbs for the brake light since they didn't appear to have two sets of contacts like the standard bulbs. They work just as expected though as tail lights and brake lights. As reverse lights they are tons brighter than stock. Overall the bulbs seem well made, fit just like stock, and look great. Knowing that I may never have to change them is nice too.
B000NSMXS6|3|It's okay.....I just wished it fit my arcan stands exactly on the saddles
B005FKIQQA|5|All parts came in the box, everything looked great, put it together and it works awesome.  I would recommend it to anybody who wants to save money vs some of the more expensive brands.
B00NEX78IM|5|I bought these, I liked them, now I'm going to order more. Skull Daddy has some cool stuff and it comes packaged well and on time.
B00S1NT2SE|5|Makes tuning my chainsaw so much easier.
B007PJBQMU|5|very nice, shipped well and quickly, installing this weekend
B005N53AM2|5|Looks exactly like the picture. Yes, it does reek like rubber for the first few days, but after that it goes away. Personally I don't mind the smell of rubber, but if you do then you might want to febreeze it or something. Just to let you know, these are not easy to get on. Do yourself a favor and read the instructions.
B00HEF55AE|5|Mine was an aftermarket item but the specs were on point. I passed smog with the lowest levels possible after failing 4 times this year. $400 beats $700 any day for one from AutoZone or Oreily Auto Parts.
B005LASPB0|5|good
B00B2YHFO2|5|It's White not yellow.<br />Don't believe me,<br /> just watch ....!!!
B00517T3JG|4|liked it came fast.
B003WEB2KI|5|Fast and Accurate Shipping. Easy to Install
B00SF45FXK|5|Heavy duty, looks great
B000CSGXBA|5|Perfect
B002NR2Z56|4|Great product
B00H88EB66|4|Get some 3m tape to protect at least the drivers side mirror top. Rock hits will likely damage these plastic parts in time.  Nice looking parts make my plain Jane Tundy look special.
B00OC8MWG6|5|Love this license plate cover! Super cute, well-made, and sturdy!
B00NW4OIZ4|4|Took a long time to get since it came from China but once I got it, it was easy to install and looks great
B00099XKKY|5|If you want shiny tires this product is great!  Easy to use and makes your tires look new.

B00192JGDU|5|Great table to cook on. Folds up cleanly and stores nicely in camper
B004UL5RUI|5|solid
B007S34A2G|3|Product was perfect as per the specs. however i wish for a more pronounced effect i.e. more rear move.
B010PZXZL0|5|Great product
B001LBLNLM|2|Not easy to program
B00ABRR4FQ|5|These things are pretty awesome and save lots of space and keep things organized especially if you're anal about keeping things tidy. It really does make a HUGE difference especially when you carry around lots of odds and ends with you. It might be a little tricky to get them snapped together but if you twist the 2 halves/sides away from each other while you push the other piece in that helped alot. From what I remember this guy makes these himself....If he expanded his line for more vehicles and did some marketing or even if sold them to the car dealers if someone wanted to add this on as an option or aftermarket he could blow this up to be a HUGE business. I will buy them for any other vehicles that I get in the future, well worth the investment.
B007XW3TC4|5|Awesome
B001PG880W|5|Worked perfectly on my 2005 YZ 85
B00ACOB4YA|4|Overall pretty good. But rain sips right through it. But it also breathing material, so it dries up quickly. Firmly stays on the car, it has stretchy bottom lining and also a strap to pul under the car.
B00A90L2AS|4|The US Postal Service mechanics use this kit. no problems reported with it.
B00MOBP3AK|5|This item is exactly what it looks like in the photos.  It's also flexible if you wanted to attach it to a slightly curved surface like a helmet or side panel.
B00475KM7K|3|Its kind of chaep feeling. I did not use it.
B00FSCCTOK|5|Excellent
B0055AQUT0|5|Great little switch, works great looks goodo

B00XJ0WAN8|5|Works perfect and was installed very easy
B00LUSDC5G|5|Works great
B00THHE73I|5|Inexpensive way to protect your rims, hide old scuffs and add pop to your ride. Easy installation took less than an hour. Best results with patience. Everything you need is supplied.
B004LQISC6|5|We purchased this as a replacement to the factory installed faucet in our RV. The installation was simple and the faucet looks custom. Although the other fixtures were antique brass this was far enough away from them to blend easily with the decor and was a much better option than stainless.<br />No leaks, clear instructions and easy installation! We're happy!!
B00WOT3YM6|3|Three stars, here's why:<br />1. Say I want to inflate to 31 PSI, I have to press the on/off button twice. The first time it goes up to around 29.5 PSI, then I have to set the value to 31 again and press the button once more time to get the desired pressure value.<br />2. Since the chuck is like a screw, every time I remove it from the tire, the air gets leaked out, which means if my tires need 30 PSI, I have to set the inflator to 31 PSI, so the extra pressure will compensate for the leaked air.<br />I can live with the first problem but not the second one, so either I'll have to return this unit or buy this replacement chuck http://www.amazon.com/CTA-Tools-1930-Straight-Lock-On/dp/B00AZJYDQI but not sure if it will fit yet.
B004GYIR7E|4|These chains seem great. I plan to use them off-road this weekend but I think they'll do the job. It was a little tricky at first figuring out the best way to latch them up, get them centered, and to figure out what hook to latch the ends on for the best fit (since they fit an array of sizes, there are different hook settings to latch onto). When taking them off your tire, unlatch them from inside the wheel-well first, and pull them away from the car.<br />I rated this 4-stars because I haven't used them off-road yet, but I think they will work great. They left divots on my driveway, so don't drive on pavement with them. These should dig into the dirt really well.
B00XZ9PFXU|3|it's meets my expectation.
B00U36K3SA|5|This step is awesome I used it for a step on the back of my camper so I can reach on top and it worked perfectly.  I am no small guy weighing around 320 this step works perfectly.
B00BFZK66M|5|Good plugs. You don't need anything better than these if you're not upgrading your ignition system.
B005KOZ25Y|5|Great Product A++
B001AY2WLU|5|Very nice product
B004I10Q9C|4|Matched Driver Replacement. Good price- included bulbs. Delivery on time. Simple install.

B001ALZ9V8|4|hard to get it right 3 times to the muffler shop sounds good with good flow i can tell its making more power
B001PYS6WY|5|It did that thing what it said. Fit my '88 GMC C1500 just fine.
B00A8XHG2Y|5|Easy to install.
B00W2Q8KSY|5|Perfect fit for our 2012 RR supercharged.
B00MG687JW|5|I like it so far
B0001EVXGU|1|Wrong size for make of car
B00004X145|5|It works great!
B007S0GQ3A|3|Took two months to receive. However is as pictured.
B00X52XPQQ|3|Product is good, feels well built, works well....The disk of software that comes with it is pretty much worthless. It had a couple of Windows Trojans on it, and I couldn't get the iPhone apps that it comes with to work at all it was an old copy, and wouldn't install. That being said, if you buy a current version the software, it seems to be really good.
B00DILTE1Y|5|I’m really pleased with this Bosch Wiper Blade. It wipes water away completely. All 19 inches of the blade make contact with my windshield. It is also very quiet and there’s no squeaking of the blade when the windshield is on the dry side of a storm. Installation was a snap. We haven’t had a lot of rain for me to test in a huge downpour yet, but I’ll update my review if I’m anything less than happy when it happens. Overall, I think this is a terrific wiper blade for the price.
B000IYR7HW|5|Great part, best of all it fits!
B0046BFEUK|4|Like these
B0014BHVRO|5|As described.
B00173U7D4|5|A little goes a long way.  Great scent.....not too perfume-like.

B000EVYGZA|5|High quality digital multimeter
B00498DFH4|1|All of the parts in these kits seem OK except the for water pump. I have experienced premature water pump unsing the Gates TB kits on 2 vehicles in the past year or so.  Buy Honda OEM parts or Asin TB kits,
B00U15L3H8|5|Works great!
B00L8P7HTI|5|Fits well on my Car
B00ZN5TBRU|5|Fricken A, breh!
B007Y34V3S|5|Very pleased.
B0013ERRSK|5|This was perfect for camping and is easy to move around. During dinner, my pup kept jumping on the table so I tied her up. The leash bumped the waterboy several times and it never got knocked over like a bowl of water would have been. It also slows he down from crazy gulping.
B00KV8U6D2|2|Not noticeably brighter than the stock. Not worth the cost for this upgrade.
B000SL4A84|5|Love it! I'm sending this to college with my son. Looks like everything he will need.
B00JA3BMDW|3|It's not bad for the price.  it tells the differences in temp but its is a few (7-10) degrees off (under). used it for measuring AC vents.
B001O7PNS2|4|I like it
B00T8M90QG|2|Bought these couple months ago.  I'm  having trouble keeping passenger side one on. I have retaped it and put it on 4 times. Every morning it is laying on ground. Its  like it doesn't  fit right. Found on driveway this morning . I'm  done took other one off and put in garage. Very disappointed.  They did look good.
B00G08ZKA6|5|Great product!
B0023VGMLU|5|Worked very well
B00GC2CJLS|5|Good quality and speedy service.
B00KTJ8D38|4|These are good but cheeper than the original
B00G9W9H2U|4|Holds a lot of stuff, but can't handle a few major bounces when it's stuffed super-tight. Side seam split a little. Enough to bug some people, but it's still holding for now, so whatever. Talking 2 thick sweatshirts, and a bunch of clothes stuffed full.
B001W19VT2|1|Really bad and cheap. You have to hold it open to try to get things in it..then it collapses into itself. I have another kind..payed more money for it but it does not collapse.
B0016J5KJU|5|Great product for these HOT Texas days....and a perfect fit!!!
B00EZKGLSG|5|Exactly what I need and expected.<br />Thanks
B00JNEBF1M|5|Good product
B000C7YJP8|5|Worked like a dream on my 94' Ranger. This part fixed my temperature gauge in dash. The old sensor was barely registering on the gauge, reading very low. Replaced with this one now the gauge is reading engine  temperature properly. Good price and was shipped in a timely fashion...
B004HCS4PK|5|Best wax I ever used.Deep, rich shine.
B009G49BE2|2|I have ordered four and have received three. Two have been installed without a problem. One set did arrive defective, but the company was quick to respond and take care of me. I ordered my fifth set and am waiting for them as we speak. They are really bright and were perfect for the installation I purchased them for.  Unfortunately, these kits seem to have a limited life span. With each return I have had to make, the company replies with messages claiming everything from I am connecting the units incorrectly, or that I am using too high of voltage. A representative even claims they have contacted me and explained how to hook them up....incorrect statement to say the least. They have consistently blamed installation error for some of these kits going bad, but has not once replied to a single e-mail directly from me. Horrible product reliability, horrible customer service. I think the flasher circuits are of low quality and the strobe lights themselves are not meant to be on the outside of the vehicle. I have purchased  six of these kits and have replaced five of them so far. They are all connected to 12 volt sources, all for the same customer.
B003XWEO7C|4|Nice Looks great on bike!
B007OSL3DY|5|Fit my 2000 Ford Ranger. No Problum at all
B000IG208Q|5|yes what i needed
B005TDKNEG|5|Love these covers!! Had to take off part of my brush guard to put them on but I suspect the previous owner had to do the same thing to put the old ones on, and the brush guard fit back on fine once they were in place. 100% satisfied with these and they look great on my Jeep!
B004ZF4930|1|Cheep connectors.  They broke with install.  Discription  said it came with premium balast.  Did not seem so premium to me.  Just  digital balast.  Kit in box was sloppy, Items thrown all over.  Also the kit came with very poor directions.
B004JP4MKQ|5|Hitch stolen in Lubbock TX.  Hope this does not happen again.
B00I3RCVG8|5|Great quality. Super low price and fast shipping. I am very happy with Detroit Axle for these.
B000GTZI5W|5|Perfect addition to my 87 VF700C Magna. These springs with some quality 15w fork oil and the bike is more solid than the day it came from the factory.
B010SH8OFW|5|Excellent quality, quick delivery, very comfy. My cars console is just a bit too low as an armrest, and this did the trick.  Like that the straps are nice and thick, well made.  No quality issues at all,  should last a long time.  Great value.
B00533ZZ8G|5|Great as advertised.
B00DB2L38M|5|Installed on my GMC Acadia due to the old and oil leaked struts.  I have been driving more than 1000 miles and very satisfying so far.
B000C9R1D8|5|Great as advertised.
B00EP49SIW|5|Excelente
B008G33ENS|5|I love my decal. I always get compliments.
B003NI38MS|4|Works as advertised.  Seems to be a little harder to close than before but we are happy to have this and won't complain.  These were inexpensive and well packaged.
B007JEK1YK|5|perfect fit..works great..
B00CU4FIWE|5|Perfect fit, durable construction. Not flimsy like most.
B00PADCZBY|5|good product  dired fit the oem hose fit very well
B00X8EWEQ8|5|Perfect fit
B003TPOU2W|5|I have ordered  this product before, and will probably order it again in the future.  I will always have this product close at hand if needed.  The big secondary benefit is no cleanup. It goes without saying.  It must be used as intended and instructed.
B00S0BNT7W|5|Im Happy
B000M3V95U|4|Much better than windex
B006H34AE6|3|not as good as I had hoped for.
B00EUA3N32|5|Good quality cap.

B00DJFRFMO|5|They have met my expectations fully
B00LUZTTL0|2|I also have 2 hoses that have very little pressure coming through. Filling a system takes along time. Calling company
B000IG3QOS|5|Good
B000PAM7TW|5|Great as advertised.
B000C8ZGMC|4|This is only an exact fit if you buy the whole exhaust, this is not a stock replacement part.
B00CUAWJ6G|5|Works great! Nice and smooth!
B004AG47UO|5|One of the best rotors I ever bought. Quiet on the first ride. The aluminum look is only a coating and will start to wear as you drive. Hopefully the coating will protect the edges from rusting. I have a 2005 Mazda3 S 2.5L. These fit on mine (Keep in mind that for year 2005, the Mazda 3 S has two potential sizes for the front. Measure yours before you buy. The compatibility matrix will say both are compatible). Don't cheap out on one of the most important components of your car! I highly recommend this Bosch QuietCast Series.
B00FG2MZXM|5|Just like the factory wires.  Fit my trailblazer ss perfect.
B00NQ198LC|5|fit great and easy to use
B00KN0UOEE|5|Better than the other gloss coatings and cleaners.
B00LUPOU1O|5|great
B00WUG1A6U|5|Excellent product and excellent customer service. These are brighter and more reliable than the HID kit I had installed in my GM vehicle. I had issues with one bulb a couple times and I let the seller know. The seller responded promptly every time and even sent me a whole new kit free of charge! Thank you!
B00XFLA2MC|5|Excellent machine and fast
B012UHU5KK|5|Perfect looks Fantastic on my car
B003U863PA|5|Great quality and product. Very satisfied.
B008ACYKZQ|3|it didn't fit the original air duct to airbox had to create a new one
B003XJ9UR4|5|You really can not beat a true track if you don't want to go to full Locker have this in the front of my 97 Cherokee and works fabulously couldn't ask for more
B004A2IKW4|4|It's a Motorcraft plug...not much else to say.
B001JT1IWU|5|works like it should, good product
B00F6XAPNS|5|Love it fits perfectly and is very durable.
B00FUT7IP6|5|Easy replacement on a 2006 Pathfinder
B008D7PHGE|4|installed easy, works great. Thanks
B004N6LKWO|1|These do not fit a 2010 Chevy Silverado LTZ! So don't buy them if u have one.I ordered a pair and I tried to send them back and they wouldn't let me.it was a waste of time and money!!!!!!
B003YNCPPS|5|Perfect fit great purchase
B00QR51UZG|5|great price..great product...fast shipping
B0066RSKS0|4|Fits and looks like original parts except they don't have Volvo markings. I give them 4 stars until they prove their durability.
B001KMO1JI|5|OEM Parts and didn't have to go to the Seadoo dealer! Win win
B00LZEGG3A|5|I am the captain of Marauder charters out of solomons MD.  We have recently discovered these awesome products .  Very low power consumption. Easy wire up. Water resistant.  We wash everything each day and the spray has no effect on the lights.  We replaced the rear deckfloodlights.  We replaced old 6×6 inch halogens.  Best decision we ever made.  Purchased another two of them and wired them under the bumper of my Toyota Tundra pointing back. Makes loading the boat trailer at night a delight.
B0009H5W5W|1|If this simply did nothing to stop fog it'd just be a waste of money, but:  1) it was immediately less clear in normal weather 2) at night it made visibility much worse 3) treated areas fog / frost _earlier_ than untreated areas  Cleaning this off my windshield was the best thing I've done for visibility in my car.  I didn't feel safe driving at night when it was on the glass.  PS - does nothing for bathroom mirrors, either.
B00DRHNI6G|5|I am very pleased with spoiler the I purchased from you for my S2000.  The spoiler and the OEM colored paint are of excellent quality.  The fit of the spoiler to the vehicle rear deck lid is spot on.  Shipping all the way from Taiwan arrived when it was supposed to arrive, on time.  All in all, an excellent value for the price charged. A 5 star product.
B0083H5SFY|5|Excellent deliver service.  Product was a perfect replacement.
B000V9FWSA|5|Bought this for my 07 Crown Victoria P71 police interceptor, it fits snugly between the seats and I probably won't have to attach it in any way. The black denim compliments the police seats.
B001EOV45G|4|Very satisfied with this purchase.  What I like the most is that it has a place to insert the trailer electrical system into the cover itself when not attached to the trailer electrical system.  So far, no complaints.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|works great
B0068EROF6|5|Very good for rain and as a shell to block wind. Not breathable material. I commute 43 miles each way to work on a KLR 650 and the Nelson-Rigg Stormrider coat and pants have held up very well. I usually wear size XL shirts and bought these in 2XL to wear over clothes and a snug leather jacket. Perfect!
B0031I1ZSE|5|Great quality very satisfied. Fitted perfectly.
B0030BVAPU|5|as expected, great product, and delivered on time
B001RMA8KW|2|I was really excited about these wipers at first.  They felt really substantial and I thought they might work really well.  Luckily, they did work well!  My previous wipers were so streaky and when I put these on, it felt like I had a new windshield!  I don't drive that often, so I didn't get caught in the rain often, but the times I did get caught in the rain, these worked well.  I mostly used them to clean the windshields with wiper fluid when they got too dirty.  They did a good job at cleaning them up.  For those reasons, I was quite satisfied and I'd probably give them 4 or 5 stars.  Unfortunately, my passenger side wiper fell off once when I tried to use it.  Fortunately, I didn't lose it and was able to reattach it and it's been fine ever since.  I chalked it up to user error.<br /><br />Now here's the bad part.  Tonight, while driving home, it began to rain.  So of course, I put on my wipers.  This time, my driver side wiper became unhooked and it fell loose under the wiper arm.  Luckily, I was near a bridge, so I pulled over under it to stay dry.  To my shock, the wiper just didn't fall off.. it BROKE.  The plastic part that you hook the wiper arm onto somehow just broke off while using the blade.  I took a picture because I was so in shock.  I tried to put it back on.  I pushed real hard and tried to snap the broken pieces together.  It sorta went on, so I hoped that I'd be alright to make it home.  I figured I'd use the blade sparingly, only when I really was having trouble seeing.  I tried it once... it was fine!  Then a few minutes later, I needed it again and POOF, it flew off while traveling 60 mph.  Long story short, I did my best driving home in the dark without using my wipers.  Let me tell you, it was very difficult to see and quite dangerous!  Fortunately I made it home okay, but because of the experience, I can't recommend these at all.  0 stars as a result of this experience, but before it broke, I actually really liked them and would have given them 4 or 5 stars.  Final verdict 2 stars (being very generous!).  It's very sad, they were like new :-(
B00684TIVE|5|I received this item in a timely fashion.  It was very easy to program the remote and the instructions that come with it were easy to follow.  I don't usually give reviews but felt I had to on this product!
B000CF5VRA|5|Exact replacement. Not OE, but Bosch is a solid German auto parts manufacturer. Immediately solved the CEL relating to low signal input from the MAF. Installed on 2000 VW Beetle with 2.0L engine.
B00BCRMAAS|5|Great for the money
B000C5DUN2|5|High quality and perfect fit for the 2002 Mazda B3000 4x2 DS model as well! Thanks for the quick shipment and savings!
B005CK7XG2|3|Product was shipped in a timely manner with two issues....  The package was shipped loosely in a box with no padding.  The part moved within the box and arrived with two knuckle sized holes in the packaging.  I was reluctant to keep the part due to the fact that it is so fragile that is well known to vw owners to break along the amount of labor that I had to use (3hrs) to put it in just hoping that it would work after install.  Secondly, while installing the part, the bracket that holds the front of the window by the mirror has a smaller size hole than the original part that I pulled out.  With such a tight space to work I just couldn't figure out why I couldn't get the screw back in.  I had to remove the regulator completely and figured out that the hole in the shipped bracket was way too small.  I had to reuse the metal bracket from my original regulator in order to install the product.  Maybe it came with two new mounting screws that may have fell out of the hole in the poorly packaged box.  Who knows?  Anyway, product is in and works like new.  I just hope it lasts.
B00D8V8VMM|5|Great
B000CJ1OZ4|3|I have to press the buttons several times to get them to light up and work. The tone is very low and you need to place your ears real close if you want to hear the beeps. I wish that I had spent the extra money and bough the other brand with the wireless remote.
B00GX4Y9AY|1|I purchased one of these units for my elderly father in law.  Charged it, tried to use it for the first time, and it literally blew apart.  It leaked all over.  Worthless.  To top it off, the time frame for a return just lapsed.  Boo, hiss.
B0000DGAMR|4|Solid construction, works as advertised.  I used this to ratchet down a tire to pop it back on the rim.
B00GPSI38M|5|Perfect! !
B004A6BV0I|5|Great pads!  Put on my 2011 GMC Terrain after purchasing the vehicle with low quality non ceramic pads that were making noise when the brakes were hot.  These solved all noise problems!  Also there was a rebate when I purchased them so I got them for a good price.  Would highly recommend!
B001CDJKS2|5|Great idea and works well.  Makes finding the blown fuse so easy!
B000CGUHJG|4|Yes I am satisfied with my energy Suspension.<br />  Plus I'm looking forward to getting more part.<br />That I Am going to order later today.
B00C1CEJNY|5|These Lines fit perfectly and the connectors are better than original.  My hard lines had rusted thru and I had to replace all the fuel lines.  The original connectors would not seperator from the hard lines.  Don't waste time trying to get the original connectors off as mine ended up breaking anyway after many many hours of messing with them.  Save yourself some time and replace the lines all the way to the fuel pump.
B007CX6DWW|5|fit tight
B00HQYTTXC|5|very nice!
B00EINJIF8|5|The item​ was exactly as described.  Easy installation.  Shipping was fast.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Arrived in two day.  Exact replacement.  Plugged it in and system is off and running.
B001AT1F6S|5|A flashlight with a 5 year all parts warranty and lifetime on the flashlight itself for less than $40.00.  Awesome.  Would recommend to anyone. Great bargain.
B001AZEMI0|5|Perfect fir for a four wheeler.
B0014FM6YS|5|Great hitch, very easy install .  Highly recommend this product
B007NZA5OQ|3|The shocks are good but doesn't really fit my Lexus Rx330 2004 model as it raised the car abnormally high, disrupting the aerodynamics. I just feel the description of either AWD or the other version could be more specific to enable one make the right choice.<br />Returning the strut now is almost impossible as i stay all the way in Nigeria and shipping back to the USA would cost me a whole lot more than its worth.
B01191UU62|1|Cheap.<br />Broke during installation
B00749RRUQ|5|I'm so thankful this exists!!  Very easy to understand instructions and works perfectly!
B004JPF5NE|4|fine not fantastic
B0007VF9XK|5|Used for mounting bumper on Ford truck.  No issues encountered.
B002UC4TJO|5|For some reason I always break these things in our camper. Super easy to install but I would recommend buying these in pairs if the price is right. I broke the first one on our last camping trip of the year and ordered this one at xmas time, I think I paid like 3 or 4 dollars... I just broke the other one and now this small little piece is over 10 bucks...
B00HNNX4OG|5|Bought this for my son for Christmas. We installed it on his truck and have had no issues. We live in Florida and with all the rain and humidity we have had no issues with condensation.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I was excited to try out the purse hammock, because I'm just like the women in the commercial.  There's no good place for my purse when my husband is in the passenger seat.  The purse hammock is a great idea that needs a little refining.  For one thing, it doesn't work with my 2010 Honda Odyssey.  You see, in order to install it correctly, it needs two captain's chairs and a center console in the front row.  Captain's chairs: check.  Center console: hmm.  The center console needs to be hinged in the back.  If the console is like mine, hinged on the side, it won't work.  The little string on the bottom has to loop around the console and it's not long enough to accommodate the side-hinged consoles.<br /><br />I jury rigged this hammock and attached the lower string to my passenger side armrest.  The hammock is a little lopsided, but it seemed to work.<br /><br />After having this in my car for three months, it has transformed from a place to put my purse to a place to store everything that used to sit on the center console . . . so I can put my purse on the console.<br /><br />This product was provided for review by Interact Marketing.
B002OUMVWY|5|very easy to store. collapses easily
B003U4O414|5|Try different type of oil treatment in pass years no one can kill lifter noise, until I try this one, at the beginning noise still there but improved a lot, weeks later I found that no more lifter noise. strongly recommend to every one.
B00OFKHX8I|1|Buy ones from Harley shop better quality
B0002JMIEK|5|I have been using this for 20 yrs.there is no better wax
B0009V1WSE|1|Don't waste your time, I went with &#34;master lock&#34; because it was a reliable brand name. To my disappointment, the keys barely go into the cylinder. Every time I have to unlock or lock it, I stand there and fiddle with it for 5-10min trying to get the key in or out. I've tried lubricating it to no avail.
B004OHVJWS|1|Cheap plastic, door won't latch.  Warped,  maybe defective I don't know.  Gave a little more for this one, thought it would be better,  it's not.
B00009PGNS|5|Works well.  Great for long trips.
B007LXOFIC|5|Works great didn't work
B00E9HWS9G|5|Very nice :) Thank you :)
B00TQ4IJX6|3|It has a few air bubbles in it. Quality is ok.
B00171M9U0|1|They did not fit my car. I wasn't paying attention because I got the GREEN &#34;THIS FITS YOUR CAR&#34; prompt. But this is for the 2 door coupe not for the four door SV.
B000CACMMM|1|The zipper broke the first time I used it!
B00TXT759I|5|Everything went good and product looks good helps ALOT! 👍 I mounted mine on back of truck for reverse
B00GD46GH8|5|There were everything I asked for thx
B007XWTXL0|5|When first put on the exhaust had a very bad Honda Civic rice sound. I wanted the deep rumble the Z is known for. I paired this exhaust set u with a magnaflow X pipe and that gave it the deep sound I was looking for. I'm looking at putting on test pipes to get a little out of it now. The exhaust went on great very easy about 30 min (I have access to a car lift at a shop) the exhaust was sitting on the &quot;W&quot; brace and rattled really bad! Also the tips were not centered in the cutouts. After I took it to the shop and had them weld in the X pipe they did some tweaking and got the exhaust lifted off the &quot;W&quot; brace and centered the tips. Now it looks great and sounds even better! The X pipe is a must with this exhaust. But still way better then spending $1,200 on what's pretty much the same thing.
B005BNP7UO|5|Works great.
B0054N8ISE|5|Great value, comfortable helmet.  Delivery very fast, even got here before expected.
B000760FWU|5|small and lightweight. Easy to adjust. Great value!!!
B00HFKE1G2|5|This fit my 2008 Tundra Limited Crew Max drivers door perfectly. It is exactly the same as the one I pulled out of my door. 100% OEM as stated in answered questions.
B00HVVVEYM|5|Great.
B000SKV4P2|4|the best
B0042Z0E6E|5|What can I say, this mat is awesome! Keep getting compliments about it! You buy it you'll love it!
B000VUASMY|5|If you have a problem with stuff sliding around in the bed of your truck, this is the answer.  Fits perfectly and provides protection to the bed of my truck even though I have a factory sprayed in Rhino liner.  Makes it more comfortable on the knees if you have to crawl up in the bed of the truck and stuff typically stays where you put it.  On the other hand.....stuff is harder to &#34;slide&#34; in and out when you want it because as I said....stays where you put it.
B005OVM1KC|4|Installation wasn't hard.  And the window works fine again.  Maybe it will last longer than the original did.
B00CMC5DII|5|These connectors work very well and are extremely easy to install. I used them to wire a parallel run from my motorcycle's R/R direct to the battery to reduce the current load on the stock wiring. I was connecting 10AWG to 10AWG and the yellow connector worked perfectly. The electrical connection is good and the mechanical connection seems like it will last for a long time.<br /><br />On the end cap, I used heat shrink tube to make it water tight and on the tap-end, I didn't bother. The connector uses a small pin to puncture the tapped wire and I think the wire sheathing will be pretty close to water tight without adding anything else. If I was to remove the connector, I'd probably put a bit of heat shrink over the puncture but I doubt it would really be needed.
B00CJ8F90C|5|Really 'aggressive' which is what you want in 36 grit, and lasts a long time. Was pleased with purchase.
B0055B0EUU|5|Made in China, but seem good quality.
B00VGL7I0W|5|Great deal fast shipping!!
B0000AY69V|5|These work great.  I bought two, assuming that one would not be enough to dry my 2011 Mustang GT Convertible.  I haven't even had to open the second one yet.
B000VUAR5M|5|Quality of this bed mat is excellent - 3/8&#34; thick of dense rubber with nubs on the bottom to prevent sliding around.  Grips tools and various other items well.  This particular model number fit my 1989 F250 with a full length bed perfectly and required no cutting or trimming.  I had been considering a roller-applied bed liner but the expense, mess, and durability were all questionable, so I went with this bed mat instead.  Mine is permanently installed - I sprayed two coats of epoxy primer throughout the bed after removing the existing rust, rolled this bed liner out, and then used 1/4&#34; stainless carriage bolts along the edges to secure it in place to the bed floor.  Very impressed so far.
B00IK2MNZK|5|Great little carb. This replaces a floatless diaphragm type carb that is discontinued, probably problematic. Sears wanted $89 plus shipping for the same thing. At that price I might have junked the 20 year old edger but instead, snapped this one on, even came with a sturdy gasket, and the machine runs like new. The choke lever is longer and comes a slightly different angle from the original but that is more cosmetic than anything else. Highly recommended and very pleased. This was cheaper than a rebuilding kit for the old carb and is brand new.
B00F64SENK|5|great product factory part
B00MQ5Z5F2|1|I charged it just once and kept it in the case and left it in my closet at the room temperature.  Few months later, I took it out to use it and found the battery has gotten swollen somehow.  It had pushed itself out of the casing.  The casing will not close because the battery has gotten too thick for it.  I can't return it because it's past the return date and I had not registered it when I first got it.<br /><br />(This had matte finish, so I guess that makes the one I got the real one, not fake.)
B002IV5400|5|Easy to install, check out the videos on YouTube.
B00E5OUOCQ|2|Does not work as well as I expected.  I have a Honda Accord and it does not fit the windshield very well.  If you have a Honda I would make sure you get one fit for a Van
B00BITHP3C|5|Easy installation
B00DOS0SOI|1|Tried product due to pricing for gallon size was way better then any other detailer on Amaon and few amount of reviews were great. Used product on new vehicle, freshly waxed and sealed. Days later dust accumulated (live in Arizona), sprayed fair amount and wiped clean, great shine and no streaks or swirls/scratches. BAD PART, later in the evening after first days use an insane amount of nats and several other night bugs flocked to the vehicle, bottle of Nanoskin and used microfiber towels, like an insane amount, every inch of vehicle was covered. Never in my life has this occured from using Meguiars, Wolfgang, Adams, Chemical Guys, etc. Had to immediately wash vehicle and remove any other trace of this terrible product. One time sadly you get what you pay for.
B00PQX5M5Y|4|I love the steering wheel cover. It works perfectly for my car. The only issue i had is that it is just a tiny bit too small. It could hug the wheel just a little bit more. Other than that well made.
B002MQ141O|4|It's tedious to lace these when the laces stick to the velcro. The laces seem cheap as well. But for the cheapest boots in the Internet they're great!
B00KTHXZLU|5|I ordered these key fobs after the top loop of my factory fob bit the bullet. I wish I had ordered much sooner than that, rather than wasted time an energy with super glue and careful handling. Took all of 3 minutes to put together, and works perfectly.
B00881EQ1C|5|It great and fit my license good...
B00GYHU1N4|5|I love this product. I will always buy this product.
B000DINKPQ|5|Worked as described, really helps get noticed on the road!
B0001EVUE0|5|work great east installion

B00MXCZ7J2|1|This doesnt fit a honda pilot 2006 steering wheel
B00HSHVVXI|4|Looks better
B000JFL7ZS|5|engraved on the socket itself &#34;not for impact use&#34; so i think thats great to remind us.
B0007RDVES|5|can't go wrong with mothers products.  Great for touch ups after a wash
B005TOLSBC|3|This didn't fit on mine which looks exactly the same :/
B00BR9L246|1|The product has a defective flaw in the sun visor control. It catches the wind when riding and blows air directly at my left ear, deafening it. I contacted the company by both email and phone, no response after weeks. I'm currently returning the item. I will never buy from a company with such sleazy service again.
B009IF2LEQ|5|Fit well, and the plug was a perfect fit. Several of the problems I have had with my Jeep have been wiring/connector related instead of actual part failures.
B008535CTS|5|got the courage to run about 30mph with it this weekend and it stood up perfectly. Scared the heck out of me to try but had to do it . LOL
B000C9S4RU|5|Installed and got my daytime running lights working again.
B007TY06JA|5|was finally able (do to weather) to install this  process went WAY easier then I expected. works great
B00094D0KO|2|For a mat that cost $80...I was disappointed. It was thinner that I figured and fit was OK but not $80 OK. Buy a generic mat and cut it to fit with scissors. Take the extra $50 and spend it elsewhere on your jeep.
B002E2WMWG|3|Very yellow and bright when you look at the light. However, you have to remember that light output will be much lower than a clear bulb due to the color. I noticed it doesn't light up the street signs as much as the OEM bulb that came in my fog light. Also the bulb lasted about 10 months before burning out. Much shorter life than I expected.
B005DVIUAI|1|I measured my hand using the method indicated by Joe Rocket on their website and ordered a size medium accordingly. When it came, it was much too small for my hand. So I gave that pair to my brother and ordered a new one in a size large. This one was a bit too tight, but manageable. However, there was hard protruding fabric at the tips of the index fingers in each glove. It became painful to wear them for more than a few minutes because of the protrusions. I tried to trim them down using scissors, but it didn't help much. So I tried again but the fabric was so thin that it ripped a hole right through the fingertip.
B00STXAXJ8|5|Great Product and Excellent Quality.
B00LBDLJ28|1|I purchased this and unknowingly had shipping charges the same as the price of the product, so it was effectively double my anticipated cost (My Fault). After taking a couple weeks to get delivered I installed this on the tank of my motorcycle. My idea was that this rubberized sticker would help protect my paint from becoming scuffed from my tank bag. I went for a ride and when i checked the sticker it had come free from its primary adhesive layer and was crooked. After a half hour of removing the remaining adhesive layer off my bike i realized that the only true statement about this product was that it would not damage the paint. Not a practical product
B008Z3VRWO|5|Great value and good quality
B00E5Y6DSA|5|well made
B007HFT034|5|Good.. Thank you!
B006BNTK1A|4|Harley emblem hard to see
B00MBURW6M|1|Received this today & was very excited to place this on my truck window. I  followed the instructions exactly.  This is not the first time that I have placed a decal on my back window.  This decal was extremely hard to put on & the rope leading the Imperial Walker broke in half an the little boy became a mess!! So now I all I have is the Imperial Walker. I am Not happy with this decal at all. The only reason it got 1 star is because its Star Wars!
B00TQ07IOQ|5|This is an easy and perfect solution to my previous after-market car mat. The other one I had was thin and was thrashed within a year. These car mats are thick and durable. Looking forward to a long-lasting relationship between my feet and these car mats.
B007TG7IJY|5|Ok
B0002UEMYS|5|Made cleaning the boat and truck a much quicker task, build quality is great.
B00DBEPGPG|5|Wonderful
B001THNWMQ|1|Just received my blitz today and I'm more than just dissapointed. This product is much more work than its worth. It's not just a spray on and wipe off as advertised. It takes a lot of effort and work to wipe it off and have it be streak and smear free. It's almost like using regular wax just in a spray on form. I've been using a spray on sealant/shine enhancer from a local detail shop and with it you just spray on and wipe off no buffing or constant wiping to get it off or the desired effect. With blitz you have to really rub it down to get all the streaks and left over residual off the car. It's almost like a paste as it starts to dry in areas becoming even more difficult to get off. Blitz cost more than twice what I pay for a similar product,it's 3x as hard to apply and use and honestly  I didn't notice even the slightest increase in wet look,shine or reflection compared to what I normally use. Chemical Guys has to know this is a subpar product at a high price point that does not come close to meeting expectations or the product description. Lots of other products on the market that work better and are half the price don't waste your time or money on Blitz.
B000CMF984|5|Eliminated the hand made guage holder on the hump.
B008NQL00W|5|Well
B00LIXZHSI|1|Not bad, good price,  !!!!! but average quality !!!!!  I bought 4 OZ lights, One of it did not work. I contact the seller. Response was fast but you have to send back the light and wait for a replacement. Too much waiting!!!!. I was about returning the whole shipment because  Job couldn't be finished . Before, I did some testing. I connected directly to the male plug stick to the led light and works fine all four leds. Problem was the female plug, no contact, wire inside damage. I ask for the female plug replacement, I dint want to cut and splice the cables, I like a neat job. THE SELLER SAID; &#34;I CANT HELP YOU, everything comes together&#34;  So I'll have to cut and splice neg and pos wires. Good ratings here, maybe I had bad luck this time!!!  NEXT TIME I SPEND SOME MORE BUCKS !!!!! I go for Rigid Ind or Lazer Leds, lifetime warranty, all wires, plus switches, relay, etc, I have bought this brands before. Uploading pic after job is done!!!! Updating later for moisture built inside light if this happens. UPDATE: Job done. Hardware supplied looks awful, BAD quality, first rain corrosion showed up!!!  Paid extra $32 for extra stainless steel (nut,screw, washer) for 4 light.
B003TOFMLQ|5|Great service and the tool worked great..
B004HE3W96|5|These make no noise, and leave very little to no brake dust left behind on wheels. I replaced a set of cheap parts store ceramic pads I installed previously with these. These ACDelco pads fixed the horrible brake dust I was getting, are quiet, and don't get the chatter feel at very low speed.<br /><br />These have everything that I expect from a quality brand. Have used their rotors in the past with nom issues as well.
B009IF1V1K|5|Awesome!! I finally fixed this heat / AC peoblem with a little help from you tube and this door! I can drive my truck again on hot days!!
B00I81OY2I|5|I love it and get many compliments on it.  Everyone wants to know where I got it from.
B00HZSLGXU|5|They are manual but great!
B00MIZT7OK|5|Gave one for my niece and nephews. They like it.
B0002Q80RW|4|works as described
B000C9NP1U|2|Wrong part
919900013X|5|Easy to install and looks great
B00KWJ5VRG|5|Worked perfect with my 01 4Runner
B0075CUJWU|5|Correct oil pressure and fitment for my 2012 WRX. Don't buy a knock off due to Subarus high BPV pressure.
B0031BOV6E|5|Great grips
B004ETK0AI|5|My husband is using this in his semi for his clipboard and paper work and it is good but needs more room for bigger items
B000F2Z2Q0|1|There are no hook fasteners in the package!!! Im not a happy customer. Need full refund or someone to immediately send fasteners. Need someone to make this right !
B00A8MZ7IA|3|OK, not much better than the premium micro-fiber towels from automotive stores!
B00ODVEWPG|5|I used in a camper van and they work very well.  They are very thin and work very well in my low ceiling van.
B012XIP074|5|this is the second time i have bought from Yatos and i am only using 2 out of the 10 bulbs, nice quality and pure white a little on the intense side but i am happy with them i am ordering again
B005CL1OPC|5|Great product stays charged long time.
B00CTW1UC4|5|works well
B001CEG90I|5|We changed our 2009 camery filter. It was easy to install and shipping was fast and secure! Order from here and change it your self will save you lot, if you go to dealer. If you dont need how to just go to youtube and look couple of  videos and thats it.
B002EQQ5ZW|5|works good for me
B00O7696NA|2|The sticker I saw was black and the one I got was white
B00A1A38TE|5|25 minute install. I tied the steering wheel to the brake pedal with a tie down strap after turning the wheel slightly to the right to make the inside bolt head down and the underhood bolt head up. Unbolted both and slid the underhood section toward the firewall to slide it out of the lower shaft. pried the inside flange toward firewall and then just slid the whole assembly out under the dash, slid in the new and reversed the procedure. I did use a pry bar to engage the inside due to tight fit. Once it was in enough to see the hole line up, I inserted a small screwdriver in the bolt hole and pried it into alignment. Loosened the tie down strap slightly and slid in the the underhood shaft. Tightened bolts. Test drive. All noise gone and steering is noticeably smoother in operation. Hope this fix last another 100k miles.
B00VGGSL9E|5|great price-easy to install,came with all appropriate hardware for my vehicle..Product shipper fast
B003YJLDPA|4|It is standard so I can fix my trailer window curtain fixture however bolt is little bit smaller so looks not robust. If bigger bolts are using it will be perfect.
B00F670QUQ|5|nice replacement hope it lasts longer than the original
B0017R5EQK|1|Didn't use it after a month I bought it and wasn't working properly, so couldn't return it
B00REJXFM0|5|Excellent quality, functionality, and easy to install. Keeps whatever you put in the back dry and is easy to fold up and latch open if you need to haul something larger.
B000GRQIGM|5|Excellent quality pegs. 2001 Yamaha r1
B006CN9FNM|5|OEM, cant go wrong.<br /><br />ADVICE:<br />if you are going to do the drain and measure technique...<br />only use this when its really really warm outside (not hot, cuz you may not get the correct reading) but something like 75F outside, it helps witht the proper measurement and speed.
B00C3058S4|5|Just like factory mirrors
B00M066NEO|4|It installed quick and easy. Really easy to adjust. It holds my phone incredibly good.  I ride a K1200LT and the only issue is it blocks half of my mirror no matter how I adjust it. Otherwise a great product.
B002HG87W8|5|This case barely fits model #9999 granite-digital auto battery charger/maintainer/deep cycle & tester and cables.
B003T1H7IA|4|purchased these for my Gun Vaults.  I originally purchased ones from another vendor that had &#34;browning&#34; logo on them but they cost a lot more then these. I returned the other ones since these were 1/2 the price.  they look the same, smell the same and from the other reviewers I expect them to work the same.  The other vendor said they last for about 1 year, these say 1-2 years so that's another + for these.  They both said Zerust so I am betting they are just one &#34;branded&#34; item vs unbranded (typical price markup for a name).
B0027A7FZY|5|Works like a champ on my 2008 dodge ram 2500 and a great price too!
B00I2W1U8Y|5|Love the colors and fabric, does not work with raising a headrest though, so I gave mine away. Customer service is excellent in answering questions via email (no real phone support regarding product details). I ended up ordering the universal multi piece set that Unique also sells on Amazon, and use it on my Subaru Forester. It fits well enough, back bench seat covers a bit loose and no real way to secure, but that is due to it not being a custom fit (which I was not expecting anyway). Love them! Am concerned about the California proposition warning on the bag that the set came in though, I wish I had more info on if there are actually chemicals used in this fabric that I would not want on my skin. There is no warning on this on the website, but I have chosen to use them anyway. Great price too!!
B004YR4E6Q|5|Wow awesome worked like a charm! One happy lady. Easy installation. Ten min fix.Thanks Amazon always saving me money.
B00GK96W7K|5|Great cap... Fast ship
B00EJFH6YA|5|arrived as expected and worked just fine on the rest bench - I was unable to appreciate how good this little bar was until I put together a mounting solution to fit it into the inter cooler gap on my 5.0 f150 - I work overnights so I am frequently making lengthy trips in very dark areas where deer and other creatures like to wander across my path. This bar will light up three lanes of traffic (from the middle lane) all the way out to at least 3-400 yards .. I've always wanted something like this for auxiliary lighting but not enough to drop 500$ on a name brand bar. So far so good. Will revise rating if needed.
B00SXEQ86U|1|Please do not buy it. It's very poor, thin and tears easily.  I bought the one it has been used only 5 months, but it was broken and in many shreds pieces.
B00480J4PU|3|just a little upgrade from factory bulb. nothing really special about it.
B000H0KNQY|5|Great as advertised.
B00JBQMJ3K|5|Great deal for the money.
B002FOF25W|5|Ok
B0099Z4MJ2|4|It worked!  Had to find directions on the web as it didn't come with any
B0002SRCKG|5|Used to take out trailer bearing seals with a wood block and hammer.  This is MUCH easier.
B001CF3JFA|5|heavy dog duty!
B00YD2HVOE|5|Excellent
B002IZFROO|5|Appears to be a good product.
B000C9Q1PW|2|The mounting bolts shank diameter are way too small for this application.  Completely inadequate considering this ball joint takes a large amount of<br />force through normal steering applications. The bolts SHOULD be 1/4&#34; diameter, with a high sheer capability! I am now forced to go to a local<br />automotive store to buy the proper bolts, or even to replace these two assemblies completely.<br />In addition, the separate collar shown in the picture is not supplied.<br />LASTLY, this ball joint is--- made in Taiwan? Really guys? These parts are for a 1966 AMERICAN CLASSIC CAR!<br />VERY DISAPPOINTED.
B00P7V8G80|5|Ok
B00445L290|5|I am thrilled with this vacuum! I have an all-black car and a long-haired black and white dog. I'm never able to get all of the &#34;sticky&#34; fur out of the upholstery, regardless of how many coins I put into the professional vacuums at the car wash. I've tried every vacuum I could get my hands on, including the Eureka Rapid Clean, with only frustration. I plugged this light-weight, heavy-suction little machine in and went for the hardest area first -- the back seats that my dog leans her body against while riding in the very back of my SUV. Much to my surprise and delight, the fur started coming up immediately! With every swipe of the nozzle, I became happier! In no time at all (and I really mean that), the car was completely fur-free, something I've never been able to achieve since I bought the car. I then went to work with the vacuum on the stairs in the house. Again, I had recently purchased the Eureka Rapid Clean for just that purpose, but the Carrand made short work of the stairs, and with much less hassle than the Eureka requires (hard to keep the switch in the &#34;on&#34; position -- thumb burn by the time you are done). The Carrand has a logically-easy on-off switch, is light weight, and has MUCH more suction power than the Eureka does; it also has tools that are easy to access and handy to use. Best purchase I've made in a long while!
B00BNIOH84|5|I'm really happy with this product. It's exactly what is says... I had no problem to put my ez pass in this holder. No problem to put it on my windshield. It's not made from a crappy material (maybe because it's made in USA and not in China). I'm going to order one more for my boyfriend,
B00DKO4P5O|5|Good for the price. The traditional metal ones are $250! NPT thread.

B0044M7KY4|5|This was actually a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law and I had it sent directly to her.  I haven't personally seen the plate, but my DIL was delighted with it and said it was beautiful.
B00A1XXD14|3|Very rigid and hard to stow away
B005CBVJWK|3|This may work well if you are trying to hold light grocery bags full of tissue.  But if any of your cargo is heavy, this net is too &#34;stretchy&#34; and your stuff will slide everywhere.
B000IYT13K|2|Not OEM cap. All black, no recomended oil writing on it.
B009EVP22W|5|fits right under the rear seat and holds all of my stuff
B0050EIUOY|5|we just bought a used mini lite 2306 that had no ladder. This is the perfect fit. Nice and lightweight too.
B00YE360TO|5|Fits perfectly
B005EPLJJC|1|Complete POS!!!!! The fit was so bad i had to file out the area around the handle to even git it to fit. Then after putting everything back togeather It didn't even work. dont wast your money and just buy OEM.. You'll be happy u did!!!
B0000AXR7V|5|Vroooom
B003CJGIM0|5|Ordered for my 2005 GSXR600,was a little worried it wouldn't fit and had been calling other dealers/repair shops nearby but they didn't have them in stock and it made me upset that my bike was down going on a 4th day without a clutch cable but it came in and I adjusted it to my bike... Life saver.
B00VVJM7SM|5|Exactly as described and popped right in and looks amazing
B0028OPY9I|5|very comfortable, as i like a firm mattress. have bought several over the years and even bought one in a king for home. i loved it, but my wife said it was too firm. gave it to the inlaws :)
B00GUDCVN0|5|I have never fixed anything before, but for some reason decided to do this repair after reading the reviews. Took me 12 minutes start to finish. Impressed my father-in-law and saved $250. Thanks!!
B00B51AXZ0|5|Great pruduct. Have saved my keys from the many times I've dropped them. I have had this item for quite a while now and it shows no sign of wear and tear. Love it.
B00318NQL8|2|Only lasted 4 months in my car
B00GSAUHB8|3|Cheap but flimsy.  The two circular rings are great and fold up quickly but the sides are kind of meh and flop around.  Not the best but good in a pinch.
B00KLIWMCU|4|The SKORCH sunshade is working great - we are in the peak of summer in southern Ohio. It is slightly too large for my new car, but not so much so that I want to return it. I'm able to get the shade folded and back into the case, but not always as cleanly as I would like - basically it parallels me driving stick shift for the first time! I'm sure both will go smoother with more time.
B001AZH6H4|5|nice for light weight stuff hanging there and stay put.
B00757KJTI|5|Reception has been good so far.  With any of these short antennas you will experience some &#34;drop-off&#34; in reception, but the Stubby seems to be doing a good job!
B00JRE38EA|5|Work great for automotive or landscape. Would buy again.
B00513G82U|5|Couple mods and is the best for that price
B00T3I8WU0|5|easy to install added visibility at night and improved washing the windshield
B005RJ3GBE|5|Don't forget to move over the RFID chip to the new case, and it works perfectly!
B000COSAU6|5|Lowest price for a quality gas charged shock absorber as I had shopped other vendors and sites. I installed them on my classic pick up this weekend and significantly improved it's ride and handling.<br /><br />Note: the manufacturer should have included new bolts, washer, and nut for the bottom portion of shock  installation as only only top ones provided, which is half-baked and illogical.
B00LVTVGW0|4|So far so good. It does the job.
B00C9EV44Q|5|sturdy and keeps damage from deer from happening
B0043AV4NK|5|Very well made.
B0033B7W3G|5|Great!
B004B61AYY|5|Took longer to get out of the box than it did to install it. Fit the winch and the 87 YJ frame perfect. .
B00BKTPP96|5|Infinity would have charged $1,100 to change the whole power seat rail not counting labor. Good Year in Kaneohe changed the $9.00 gear for $346.00 ( labor). Infinity will not change this gear, they want to change the whole power tract rail. Thanks Amazon for getting me in touch with the $9.00 G35 Power Seat Tract Rail gear.
B0038YNA16|2|Can not put any pressure while buffing or the machine stops.
B00CKCZNTY|3|These are just ok. I like the big Mazda writing on them but the get a lot of lent on them that's hard to get off and the spin the wrong way a lot and I have to keep taking them off and positioning them the right way to show the Mazda symbol. Functionally,  they are soft and do keep the harness from digging on your neck, but gets warm and I find some people just pull it down to where it's not on them.
B010AIYTX0|1|stil no reply.. ripped me off and the quality if very low. never buy!!
B006BDKIKM|5|Perfect fit, sounds great!
B000C0YR1G|5|Works flawless
B00HPTLL0M|5|Perfect fit 2007 VTX 1300
B004SRC6GM|4|Better quality and smoother operation than other brands.
B007PT3L00|3|Product is great when installed and working. If you are not gifted in 12 volt systems consider not buying this. I deliver mail in my personal vehicle and have purchased 3 of these kits in 5 years. Other than the wires running to the bulbs I have to completely switch out every component in order to fix an unknown problem. This last set was bizarre. Every wire harness was reversed red\black which through the process I discovered was not at all a problem. But thanks to this discrepancy I thought laterally and considered there might be another manufacturer mistake. And there was. The label on the power supply indicated that the power and pattern harnesses were reversed. The pattern wire was on the reversed pin, so I had to squeeze the prong back through the harness and switch it. This was the first time I appreciated that the wire ends were cheap. And they are cheap! MOST install problems happen at these junctions. Use bulb grease! Make sure all wires engage each other before putting power to it. The shocks can be stunning. Make sure the power supply is able to cool, definitely do not put it under the hood. I have mine inside a frame rail with a splash shield opposite side of exhaust.<br />The only reason I give it a 3 stars is once it works it is an amazing attention getter. Super bright.<br />But in hind sight I would have spent more for a Warn or other name brand, or just have gone to a shop that does it.
B008D8I652|3|It seems to be smaller than the size it shows
B000C55MQK|5|Made a huge difference
B007D5480S|5|I have a 2011 prius.  This fit perfectly.  I had it installed by my regular mechanic and he said it fit perfectly and the hardest part of installation was just removing the coverings on the wheel base to get at the place where you actually install it.  After that, it fit perfectly with the bolts that it came with (he mentioned that a lot of times he has to use different bolts).
B000A09MFE|5|Love getting these at a lot less cost than at the car dealership.
B003O79IQ8|5|Holds both of our full face helmets with a little more space to put gloves, hats, etc.  We love not having to worry about our helmets when we stop somewhere.  Would highly recommend this product.
B00KTIR2IG|1|Broker after just a month of use. The plastic is bad quality
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Great product and quality!
B0015ASMHC|2|Product has a short in it somewhere and never worked. Although I take responsibility for not contacting them to resolve the problem
B000BKJDKM|5|Good for the price
B00JK322MW|5|Got these just in the nick of time as the day I got them my husband decided to leave the lights on in my truck tonight. They came in handy! I really like the carrying case fits in underneath the back of a seat. I mean everybody needs to carry jumper cables with them because there's always that one time that you will need them.
B003VTCTJ2|5|Wonderful
B00G6SF0AA|5|Looks really good. Fits perfectly.
B001DH0Q62|5|Verry Good Item.
B000N2U5E6|5|EASY INSTALL , Engine Fires Right Up
B000F7VKD4|5|works great cleans well and protects both of our cars (2013 FFH with white leather) and (2013 chevrolet volt with black leather seats with white panel inlays).
B00B3L2DQO|4|just what I needed ....fast delivery
B0012ARRCQ|5|Perfect Just what I needed. Works perfectly
B010ATFLP4|4|I got these to replace the two 921 incandescent bulbs in the 3rd brake light assembly that light up the bed of the truck. I did not like the yellowish bright light that the OEM bulbs put out and wanted LEDs that would not drain the battery as much since these come on every time you hit the key lock or open the door and stay on for about 20 seconds. I like the softer white light that these LEDs provide and they fit very nicely (they are only slightly longer than the bulbs they replaced). They are however significantly LESS bright than the original bulbs that they replaced, so if you are looking for MORE light in your cargo area look elsewhere. I wasn't getting them to add more light, just a more pleasant white light that would be more efficient on the battery and for that these do just what I wanted.
B00RM327NG|1|phone and clip keep falling off
B00COYNZJ8|4|As far as a functional sunshade, it appears to work as well as any, and this one has the added bonus of showing off my essential geekiness while blocking the sun!  The picture doesn't show up as well in the shade and Chewie is pretty easy to lose in the shadows, but otherwise I am extremly happy with my purchase!
B000GTUEL0|5|Great product and I found easy to install
B00004X147|2|I always seem to end up spilling half the oil when transferring to a larger container for storage or transport. The top lid doesn't really seal, so when you go to tip it to pour out of the side spout, it leaks.
B00IBP0XIU|5|Awesome. I love it.
B007YPRIWM|5|Looks amazing on my camry haha
B0006Z9SRA|4|I received in quick time just what I ordered.  It works fine and was a great price.
B00DSD7MC0|4|Once a DeadHead, always a DeadHead!
B00CH23LI2|5|Great product and added &#34;BLING&#34; factor.
B0002JM8HM|5|Yes nice product!
B000GQ6LF6|5|20 mins. to install.I love it
B004ULDFA2|5|These fit my Aura perfectly & look great!
B001TLC12E|5|I read some great reviews about this product and most of the ones with bad reviews couldn't get the product on or understood directions.  I didn't even read directions, the video was super helpful.  They fit well, look nice and are reasonably priced.
B0051MYL8E|5|Good pads for the money and I expect them to last several uses before throwing away and replacing.
B00ZTT1F06|2|It fit but couldn't get it adjusted to run properly. I know these carbs are a bit tricky to adjust, but I am somewhat disappointed.  I had to put my original carb back on and had better success adjusting it. That makes this purchase a waste of $ for me. Maybe someone else might have better luck.
B000CSNK7U|5|Super easy to install and it works great!
B00DVVY7MM|4|Excellent. The holes are big enough for me to put my fingers in and the ears are sharp and made out of a durable and strong plastic. I feel much more safe holding onto this when walking to my car - especially in the Kmart carpark. I have small hands but the cat face fits discreetly in my hand and I can hold it securely. So many people compliment it (&#34;it's so cute&#34;) not realising its actual purpose - which is a good thing.
B0066TFCJS|5|Very pleased with product!
B0002Q7BZE|5|Fit perfect and works great.
B000C5FLFC|5|ok........
B00AVNC2HA|5|Great product, perfect match.
B000C2Y4QC|5|Perfect fit. Great hose. What can I say it is a GATES.
B00S0MRK30|5|Im Happy
B005BNG1U4|5|Great
B00N8L0WMO|2|I wanted the Dolphins on the outside so it is not attractive.
B00WFHHUKE|3|Will this work on a 3757 bulb
B00PWG6AC4|2|Extremely thin & fragile, hard to fold up because they tend to bend incorrectly.
B006YBDRX6|5|Love it way better then weathertech!
B00ZBO97F4|2|Lights were bright, used them in my atv but they didn't handle the bumps. The led bulbs broke out of the socket within 10 hours of riding. I would recommend this product for on road only. Not strong enough to handle off road abuse.
B002NUABUO|5|I like it
B00N2T7216|5|I bought this coz I have 2 cats, sassy and brie-brie. Also in memory of rusty and calista. I really really love it. The cat face with green eyes in black background is AMAZING. I knew that this will not fit the whole windshield of MY RANGE ROVER SPORT HSE, but I have a plan to make this sunshade incredibly great. I already purchased red and blue sunshades, but I prefer to use the red one. I used 2 sunshades at the same time. On the top is the cat eye and behind is the red one. Viewing it from the outside, it looks like the cat eye subshade was framed in red metallic material. This is only possible if you have 2 or 3 sunshades. Really cool design. Eye catcher too. BTW, the packaging was GREAT. EXCELLENT customer service. Thank you everyone. NOTE: (8/12) MAJORITY OF MY STAFF were asking where in the world I got the cat eye sunshade. I was very glad and proud to tell everyone to GO SHOP AT AMAZON. MY STAFF love all my sunshades.  One of a kind.
B00ITAF0EE|5|Nice bulbs. Oem output, so hopefully they last as long as stock. Curious to see if there's any improvement in bad weather, but I installed them purely for cosmetic reasons.
B00GM2BWBQ|5|Product works great!
B0017TFPCQ|5|Excellent
B00SS17ZJ2|5|Item is great and matches the dash bezels that came out first.
B00XE5D7Q2|2|Strap hard to get too...
B004U3XQWC|2|In all of my years of dealing with various high quality car performance parts, I read many of the reviews for the Moroso Catch Can, and most of them were very positive on various sites and forums, including Amazon.  I have owned a couple of other simplier catch cans without the spigot and these worked just fine, and were machined much better vs. this Moroso one.<br /><br />First Issue: There was no assembly instructions.<br /><br />Second Issue: For the price paid you would think that Moroso would have these units at least partially assembled like the brass fittings and spigot.<br /><br />BIGGEST ISSUE: The parts that needed assembly into the body (brass fittings, and steel spigot assembly) did not thread in properly. I lubricated the threads before attempting to assemble/screw on the pieces.  What a NIGHTMARE!!!  Only after just 1-2 complete turns the parts would not budge anymore.  I had to remove the fittings and spigot, and the aluminum threads on the body were chewed up really bad.  Since I have some mechanical and machining experience, I took some time to clean up the chewed up aluminum threads on the body, and in doing so, I saw that Moroso thread pitch was not matching the brass fittings and steel spigot thread pitch, which caused the brass fittings and steel spigot to chew into the aluminum threads.  Not a real big confidence booster for a $138.00 catch can product, when lower cost units selling for around $90-$100 are much better machined, and the fittings thread pitch matches correctly with the thread pitch on the aluminum bodies.  I know this, because I still own two different catch cans from other manufacturers, and they are a breeze to work on.<br /><br />I finally was able to get the fittings to screw in with the help of a vise.<br /><br />Overall aluminum machining of the body is great, and the design/concept is great, but the execution and details like the thread pitches not matching the fittings is a huge negative.  My advise is if you are good with tools and you know what you are doing, this is a great catch can solution, but for the novice who only has a couple of wrenches to work with, I would advise looking at other non complicated catch can solutions.<br /><br />Good Luck!h tools and you know what you are doing, this is a great catch can solution, but for the novice who only has a couple of wrenches to work with, I would advise looking at other non complicated catch can solutions.<br /><br />Good Luck!
B0006SH4GE|5|Came in a box and did not leak. Works great on my camel-colored leather seats to keep clothing stains from accumulating.
B00KY8EZYU|5|Just as the original remote case. Like new the old remotes after transfering the circuit board. Could not be more satisfied with that price and quality, big plus the free shipping.
B005FG64VS|5|the light was shipped to me whit in two days. its a perfict fit.
B009OBVXDO|5|Very good product.
B000CMJ2QE|5|Good better than expected
B00K7935EM|5|This cover went on very easy I loved using the License Plate Frame Screws Fasteners with the Plate. It looks very sharp.
B001DEPOLC|5|Love it
B00080QHMM|4|As advertised.
B00OVB6XVO|5|Kool gadgets
B001GN3ESU|4|The cover does a nice job of covering the wiring plug on the trailer side.  Keeps the plug water resistant and definitely keeps out any dirt dust that might be in the area.  Works well in my application (trailer to haul tools/spares to automotive track events).
B00X9CJCIC|5|Arrived as advertised. good quality went on easy. Only sticker I could find.
B00KQ81M94|5|Great product and it does a great job taking the water of your vehicle after washing it!!! Great price, quick ship, would recommend
B0033LZ63Y|5|Easy to install, has a lot of pulling power
B00AAZNTUS|4|Handy to have to hold drinks.
B008AYAL3Y|4|Company was great to deal with, I was just expecting more light output than it seems to produce.  Still a big improvement over the stock back up lights bulbs.
B006GZHESO|2|The top mirrors keep getting loose and too slanty can't see a dam thing.
B001PWA0IO|5|Product arrived early & Simple install!<br />Can't believe truck did not come with it!<br />Smooth tailgate now!<br />Perfect addition save wear & tear on tailgate dropping down so hard!
B00E3BQQ5K|1|Not worth one star. Bought two sets, both threaded shafts broke. Useless after that, and can't even return them.
B002UCYRZU|1|I don't understand how this polish kit could have a four-star review.  I used it on my Honda motorcycle windshield: the number two introduced scratches and haze; the number three made even deeper scratches.  I had to purchase a new windshield.  Now I'm out over $200.
B00JFTC0T6|5|Extremely good quality for the price. Actually... price aside, this is extremely good quality. Identical to OEM. Finish it perfect, Fit was perfect, installed in 10min. BUY THIS!! You can't beat it for the price.
B000C7VYRO|5|Used this to replace the cracked radiator on my Dodge Caravan and so far it is working great. Installed without a problem and seems to be good quality materials. Will update with my experiences further down the road.
B001FRSQSU|5|works great! Thanks Amazon. solved that problem.
B00UPN14NE|4|went on good. follow directions.. i like it
