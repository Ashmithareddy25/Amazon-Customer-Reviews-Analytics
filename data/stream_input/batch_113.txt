B00KLDUNAS|5|Very comfortable, fit size 10 mens foot comfortably.
B0045VVRRU|3|Was hoping the ears would stand up, but there's nothing in there to hold them up.
B004L5IH14|5|Very cute scrub top. Kinda hippy looking.
B000KGOLX6|4|Fit as expected, slow shipping.
B00EYZD1HQ|5|I thinks awesome!
B00EV75EYK|4|High quality
B001BAS7MG|5|Bought these for my husband and no complaints..he wears them to work . They are thick as described and keep his feet warm .
B00LWEU7ZG|5|Awesome! My favorite go to hoodie!
B00EOOOTAU|4|My 9 and 11 year old daughters love the Signorelli brand of tops.  We typically buy them at Nordstrom Rack to get good prices.  When I researched the brand to find tops for myself, I found this shirt and thought it was cute.  I also wanted a soft comfortable relaxed shirt based on the rave reviews from my daughters with their Signorelli tops.  So, I thought this shirt would fit the bill.  I am 5'2\\" and weigh 100 lbs with a small bust, so I ordered a size small.  It was not available in an XS.  I have not worn it yet since purchasing it in April because it is a little baggy and falls off the shoulders.  I am not used to the style, but decided to keep it because I am sure I will wear it in the Fall with a layer underneath.
B00QFD6FCS|2|it's too large for me，and Display the wrong size on the description，it's too disappointed for me
B00HWSCMH2|1|I ordered a black one this size fit great this one and the white one were way to small,
B005LXXVMA|5|This keychain is very durable and handy. I carry my keys on it daily and it can easily be clipped and unclipped to anything. The built in bottle opener on it is handy since I dont need to carry any extra bulk by having one with my keys.
B00E955EPI|3|You click to see Amazon's size chart right next to where you input your size.  I found my size there, selected it, and completed my order.  What I didn't know, was that the top was being sold by an Asian company and sized for Asian markets.  Consequently, an XL Asian-sized top will not fit an XL American woman.  Their XL has only a 36\\" bust!  I wish I had known this at the time I ordered!<br /><br />Frustrated, I emailed Amazon, and they sent my complaint to the seller, Truendi, who has not been very helpful yet.  They want me to pay the entire return shipping fee to their warehouse (perhaps in South Korea, but I have not find proof of which Asian country is their home).  Since I ordered in good faith using the sizing chart that was the most obvious, I don't think I should be liable for ANY costs of any sort.<br /><br />Well, time will tell.  I'll write more here when this matter is settled.  If they insist I pay for their mistake, I will assume that I got cheated, and make a grievance claim through Amazon's A-Z Satisfaction Warrantee.  Look for the final determination here -><br /><br /><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>><<>>
B000XF2LMC|5|It worked great, not very realistic with the movie, but did the job. Scared some kids and adults with it.
B0044QEBME|5|The shirt came surprisingly fast, since it was from Korea. Also if you are in the US be sure to follow their sizing guide. I am normally a small in the US and when I bought this shirt I went with a medium, according to the chart. And the shirt fits perfectly, I am 5'7 and 130 pounds and the shirt in medium was just right. It wasn't too long or too baggy. Although if you are more muscular you might have a problem with the fit, so be sure to carefully consider which size to buy.
B00II9DE44|1|I purchased 4 different colors (brown, black, blue, and grey). The only pair that fit properly was the brown pair. The others are to small. They are always sliding down and pulls in the seat.
B007OX0M2W|1|Save your money and don't buy this robe.  It is a piece of crap: poor quality flannel, poor construction.  No wonder the laundry instructions tell you to air dry this robe--if you place it in a dryer, this robe will shrink to the size of a wash cloth!  What a disappointment!
B0008EOG6W|4|The gold standard in my opinion.
B00LP8I4B8|3|Its a like because the quality not was good but the fits ok
B0018OMJJW|5|Product as advertised with prompt professional delivery. I originally requested the wrong color (my fault) & I was able to return and replace the item without paying additional postage.
B00Q9KSZ5W|5|This item is the best
B001F5Q5T4|5|Excellent value
B00IZKU5UM|4|A little than expected
B00N7KA72G|3|I ordered this cause I'm a plus size pregnant women. I ordered it big enough it fits but was disappointed that its cut as a regular old tee shirt.
B00RDCEJIM|3|Good hat but I feel like its an old persons hat, im 18. The bill doesnt look like the picture shows it. Even after bending it I cant get it in that kind of position. And the panels are really loose, no firmness to them at all. I just wear it backwards. Nice quality material and cheap price
B00QKQDYWY|3|I thought the fleece material was really thin.  Not at all like a Carter's pair of fleece pajamas.  The bottoms are true to size but I found the top to be a bit on the short side.<br />Overall an OK pair of pajamas.
B004UTCL0E|4|I like it. It's nice and shiny. And seems durable enough. It is holding up perfectly in rain or shine.
B00P7PGZPM|1|this outfit is so cute.....in the picture! what they give you looks nothing like the picture though. it's a very cheaply made outfit and the fedora doesn't even look like a fedora. I'm trying to return it but the seller won't contact me. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!!! you have been warned.
B00IO2ASC6|4|I ordered this for Halloween, 2 weeks in advance, didnt realize it shipped from Australia, so I wasnt able to wear in time for costume, but the material and fit is awesome! I will definitely use it for next year.
B007UNJHNG|5|very good
B000UOSNUA|5|Very good sail cloth jacket  heavy but lite enough for a cool night or rainy day.
B00DEODIA8|5|This is absolutely gorgeous! Had Christmas pictures made in it and am thrilled with how it looked in them. Beautiful!!
B000CDW1FC|1|Chest Large (inches in) 40.94, while the actual 44.88. (inches in)
B000MP1EX0|1|Not as pictured. This item has been replaced with another style. The fit is horrible, they are very uncomfortable.
B00DYQ872U|5|This was purchased for an eight-year old.  Very cute and well made; great for the price.  I added an applique to add some interest and it turned out adorable!
B002LC9FPQ|4|Scary.Got lots of screams in corn maze.
B00ITLHQOA|5|Warm and cozy !!!
B008EDWRFQ|1|the material is paper thin so it shows everything
B00FAIMO7O|4|adorable. the ears fit on top of the head in the cutest way. im a size 24 and i knew it would be small for me but because of the two halter ties i was able to wear it comfortably enough, just looks much more low cut on me.
B00AQ4F3DO|5|Just exactly what we expected.  Using it as a costume for Doc Brown in a Back to the Future skit.
B005901M3U|5|I love these jeans!  Lucky makes a great product so I continue to be loyal to them.  The jeans are soft and stretch just the right amount as the day wears on.  I am 50 so I'm not into skin tight jeans, never was to be honest, so these are perfect.  I love the straight leg and the color and style make me feel stylish without appearing like I'm trying to be back in my 20's.
B00FLY4R5O|3|Nice shorts, but a bit skimpy.
B006NU7FRC|5|I loved it! I am a size 6 in dresses and tops, 8 if it's a tight dress and 8 with pants. I have a 34 DD bra size, I am also 5'4''. I bought this in the teal color (I got a medium) and I was stopped while walking on the street because people (mostly other girls) kept on complimenting the dress! i love it so much, I'm considering getting it in black.
B004PHYA2I|5|I bought these for a friend at work and he absolutely loves them. Wears them to all the parades and other events he attends. He wishes they came in more colors.
B002HRF5VS|5|Excellent!!! A great way to shop... I recomended for everyone. You get what you want without moving from ypur home
B00K0WLX2C|5|Bought for my fiance and he loves them. Says they are super comfy, as they are made out of light weight sweat pant like material, I would expect them to be!
B00VK458E8|5|These are the best underwear. They are extremely comfortable. I think I've purchased a pair in every color.  :)
B00EQTP0C4|5|The jacket looks just like its pictured! It's made of a stretchy material, so it's really comfortable. The fit was just right too. I'm 5' 2\\" and 110 lb and the small fit snugly.
B005MIJVLO|4|wish it was a bit shorter...but its nicely made.
B00EJ9YDT2|5|Great quality very thick and not cheap my kids were like size 8 t-shirts and this hoodie is more like a 14 but better big then small they should be able to use it next year
B004GGUAFY|5|Purchased for son in law lover of Pink Floyd.  I am sure he will be happy on Christas when he opens his gift.
B00DIUB8ZK|4|Grandson likes it.
B002ETVM0M|5|Everything was as advertised. Good quality product.
B00LUH0ZD4|5|Very good .....and good quality ....
B004UULDL6|1|Some medallions fell out of the bag upon first opening it.  They were already broken off of the sash and head piece.  The ribbon that crosses over the stomache was detached up top so I had to sew it back.  And, the bracelets packaged with costume were neon bangles, not the gold ones pictured.  It came on time, but I needed it a few days later, so I did not attempt to return or exchange it.
B0081CVZPS|5|I read the previous reviews on this dress so bought the xl and it fits me perfectly.  Nice weight, hugs the curves but not flimsy,
B002JT4FLK|5|I ordered the costume for my 11 month old daughter.  It's pretty big on her, but she looks great!! Can't wait for Halloween!
B00BPCR712|4|This long brim hat blocks the sun when I'm on the water. I needed something to wear on our boat, but now eapven use it on the beach- it provides great sun block from my face.
B005243W22|3|This pair didnt fit as well as the darker pair.  It was tight through the hip area.
B00GDLWM0G|5|😃
B0018QTUOC|5|The price was great, the shipping was fast and I love the Jeans. I had some Levi's about 10 years old that I loved the fit on but they were full of holes and finally needed new ones. I took the waist and length size off the old Jeans and reluctantly decided to buy new ones online. After choosing a color I purchased the jeans and when I got them and tried them on they were a perfect fit just like the old ones. They have barely changes after several washings. 5 Stars in my opinion.
B00DOUVWLO|5|This jacket is so cool!  It's reversible, warm and stylish.
B0039VUMJG|5|Love it! &#34;Two girls with green eyes&#34; (in high pitched girly Chinese voice) fav movie ever!!
B000VR6E2A|5|Finding. Bra in my size (40G) that is comfortable AND affordable is difficult, sometimes impossible. I started buying Glamorize bras a few months ago, and have been pleased with all that I have bought. True to size, comfort straps, no &#34;pointy&#34; TaTas and everything is where it &#34;should be&#34; before gravity took over.<br /><br />I love this bra, have it in 2 other colors and plan to buy many more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this bra for all really large chested women
B003ASURK2|4|Nice hat for a great price. Warm but &#34;weightless&#34;.
B00BBLCX4S|5|I wore this for an 80's costume and it was a big hit.  It fits securely and fluffs out easily out of the package.  Very nice quality at a good price.
B001GG887Y|4|Just a simple red cape. you can tell its made on a cheaper side but it worked for what we needed
B00KHWGW44|4|The quality is good and unlike other Shemaghs I own it didn't require several rinses to get the extra dye out.
B001AQK0EO|4|I was informed ahead of time by the seller that these run small in size. Therefore I ordered 1 size bigger and it was a perfect fit. My son loved it.
B002PO3RW2|5|Got this product for my mothers birthday and she absolutely loved it. It does look like as advertised and the material was great and came in great shape. Was a perfect present in my case.
B00JL9HSC4|4|Very Pretty...  but the fabric is like 100% polyster, so dry's off quick
B0018OLPP6|5|EL JEANS LLEGO EN BUENAS CONDICIONES, MODELO MUY BONITO, EXCELENTE CALIDAD EL MATERIAL Y MUY RÁPIDA LA ENTREGA, MERCANCÍA EN BUEN ESTADO
B003HR2NNA|5|love it
B00CHA4NN6|5|So cute. As pictured. Love it. Too large for a newborn.
B002208B8O|5|Good wig caps.  Did what I needed them to do.  I have a lot of hair, so they did a good job keeping it under control while I wore a wig.
B00C7MIJWU|5|My daughter is 4 now, I got these for her birthday. She was excited about the adorable buttons on the pockets and said they were so cute! They are soft and adjustable. We love them. Definitely going to get more soon!
B00FDND7KE|3|the sizing is alittle to big but very comfortable
B008P8HGFQ|5|Long live UMBRELLA
B00ORFPNLK|5|This dress is stunning! As another reviewer mentioned it is classy as well as sexy. I am a bit curvy and the fit was very flattering. I got lots of compliments and no one believed how little I paid for this gorgeous dress! The shipping was also very quick - I received it in 2 days which was exactly when I needed it!
B000W0POHM|4|Probably runs a little small for most babies, but fit mine just fine.  Decent quality, considering that it's a costume she'll wear once.     Overall, very satisfied.  Note: the hat doesn't come with any ties to keep it on her head -- we sewed ribbons to the hat so that it didn't fall off.
B00F6E67PC|5|This is my husbands third pair of Fit Flops. It's the only sandal he will wear. Thank goodness they look as good as they feel. He has a large flat foot. Finding 13's that are comfortable was a task! Fit flops fit the bill. He litterly wears them out. His last pair lasted 2 years. He has lower back trouble and in these he is able to walk and shop like in tennis shoes. Definately worth the money!
B00421BL4M|2|I it this or my dad and it was way too small although the qualit of fabric was good. Do not waste ur money
B004DPFTVI|4|Very soft and comfortable. I used them for underskirts and it looks like I'm not wearing any shorts. very nice
B00W6ALCF4|3|Would like same style slightly shorter and lighter weight for summer.
B0043VDK04|5|My wife had a similar robe that got damaged in the wash...She was very disappointed as this thing had been super luxurious...I purchased this one not knowing if it would be able to take the others place. It has. It's very thick & inviting. Well made. I'm very satisfied, and would purchase it again w/o hesitation.
B00FXQ11CW|4|this shirt is a perfect example of quality , but it is not offered in their normal 3xl tall sizes , so be careful if you are over 6 ft tall  it is too short , and kinda tight compared to their other shirt`s , very well built .
B001REGF5C|5|Arrived quickly. Nice product for price.
B00BLNGZ54|1|Always advertising on my Facebook page. How anyone could spend $32 on a pair of underwear is beyond comprehension. $28 for a t shirt. Please!
B000NZW3JI|5|This shirt is beautiful and came to me in brand new condition. It shipped very quickly. I love my new shirt!  Thanks!  :D
B00JVGFF7C|4|comfortable and supportive
B00A7QUD5O|5|I bought these for my tall and lanky son and they fit very well and he said the best fit he has ever had in a T
B000A2KAP8|5|Tough work pants fit good with room to move. Love the way they fit and hold up with good pocket design.
B008MC2L6E|5|Good quality and arrived on time.  Did not shrink in the wash on the cold setting so I do NOT know how it would be if it was washed on warm/hot.
B00CKHE39A|4|I like this hat, am usually not a hat person, but am trying to change.
B005GPLHTM|5|I wasn't sure when I first opened the bag, it seemed the material was &#34;shiny&#34; but I was sooo mistaken!!  This jacket is awesome and I want to wear it all the time.... work, after work or even dress it up for something a bit fancy!  Thanks!!
B00E3OCMJQ|5|The quality is excellent! It is made of fine cotton and felt so comfortable. The price is normal but you won't regret with such good quality.
B00EOP6S3A|5|I love the sweatshirt, and the material. However, I would normally buy this sweatshirt in size M (US size) I order this one in L and it fits perfect. Sizing is different.
B005IYMYNE|4|I really like this shirt very much I ordered small but it feels like medium no matter its still fits nice
B00HH5G7KS|5|Its big but thats how its supposed to be.  I really like it and its cute.
B00QQYOZF0|3|For being and extra small it's really big I have to put it on the last row for a good tight fit.
B00CL5EL7K|3|This maxi dress definitely ran large, all over.  The material is very thin and I'd think twice about going out in public as it is see through in strong light.  At 5'8&#34; the XL dragged on the floor and was very loose, even after washing a few times.  On the positive side, it's soft and comfortable and makes a good after-beach lounger.
B009WNEDGI|5|Nephew was in love. Made me buy an adult superman swim trunks to match his
B00MBGY9RQ|3|It's cute. Size as espected, nice quality, great colors.
B00LBDYZB0|5|No complaints.
B00I54WZGK|4|This Bra does what it's supposed to, flattens and it is comfortable.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is that the size chart is misleading.  You can't use your normal bra size you have to measure and see how many inches your chest is all around and use that number to pick a size. Ex. I am a 32 C But my whole chest measures 38  inches so I got the 38 size and it fits great
B00JPFA2TU|4|Looks even better on than in the photos but there is a seam just under the chin that isn't tight enough. The fabric there really sags.
B0018VJH4A|4|I bought the size small scrubs for work at a hospital. The shirt was a little tight in the shoulders and the pants were a little too big. Despite the tight shoulders, the scrubs were very comfortable - a bit like wearing pajamas to work. The pockets are deep and highly functional. I used these scrubs for three months, wearing them nearly every day to work. They maintained their high quality throughout the three months.
B00TI5DY4C|5|This is the second suit I ordered, love this also. It feels like the old days, great on too!
B00PMQVQUA|3|A little small but it works
B00OHMNWUM|5|These bags are not only practical but so adorable. I always used to bring just plastic bags for laundry and small items while traveling. No longer! These keep my stuff organized and they're stylish. :) Also, the quality is so good. I've already used them on three trips and I haven't had any trouble with the drawstrings or anything else. These bags will last a long time.
B005VGI5UU|5|my grandson loves this rugby team so this was a great gift.
B00HP538PC|3|Very cute on and fits great.
B003VLWWOC|4|It's thirty five bucks, two peice with a sash and tassels for the shoulders. My son is 5'8&#34; 130 lbs and it fits great. In fact he could be a bit taller for the pants length and still be ok. YES the &#34;tux&#34; jacket ties in the back. It's a cheap costume not a real tux, but it's not made of tissue or plastic like some people are acting like. His girlfriend is dressing as a princess and they'll look great together. As good as any Halloween costume you'll buy, better than some for the price
B005DETKY0|5|If your a 14-16 go for a 2x. It fits well and is sturdy
B008EHO0SO|5|Once I opened the package, I knew I picked the right jacket for my granddaughter.Is is soft. cute, plus it has magnets, not buttons. For a small child, the temptation to pull off the button and putting it in their mouth is eliminated.
B00DD5FX06|5|What a great product! This Baja Joe hoodie is one of the most comfortable and warm hoodies I have ever worn.  I will more than likely use just this and maybe a sweatshirt underneath and I will be perfect for temperature.  I recommend getting a size up if you want to wear other articles of clothing underneath it (which is what I do), but otherwise you should get your regular size, it sticks close to the sizing. Very fun and very good buy!
B0045RYBEA|5|the bracers are great, look just as they do in the picture. only issue I have is they chafe a bit at the wrist, but that was easily remedied with a trip to the craft store
B00C3DLHYK|2|Drrss is being returned.<br />Good as a one time &#34;costume&#34; but thats about it.<br />Stripes sleeve is actually sewn inside out.<br />A friend bought the same dress for the pageant amd apparently ALL of them are sewn improperly.
B00UTEF13I|1|To small I asked for a XXL it must be and  XXL for kids they fit my son the is 10 and were a small boys.
B003BV47QI|4|Before bung this gown, (in gold), I carefully read other reviews, and ordered mine in 1 size larger than I usally do.  I received it today, and I must it is GORGEOUS!  The beading and lace are probably machine-made -- but they are so wonderfully intricate and delicate that they SEEM hand-made. A true touch of magic is also in the design of the dress -- elegantly simple, it could, (in ivory), even be worn as a wedding dress, I think, for someone who wants and/or needs, long sleeves and a high back.    However, this MOTHER OF THE BRIDE FORMAL WEDDING PARTY GOWN BEADED LACE AND SATIN MOB DRESS, is woefully mis-sized.  Even with one size larger, it does NOT fit me. TOO SMALL! :_(   I shall keep it, however, and call it my \\"diet dress\\", an inspriation to help me lose weight!  (Luckily, I ordered another dress -- in my regular size -- which at least goes on.  In fact, it is slightly too BIG!  I do wish the manufacturers of evening gowns would get together and make a STANDARD SIZING CHART, for the benefit of their customers!    C A V E A T.....This dress carries a tag saying: PROFESSIONALLY DRY-CLEAN ONLY.  This tag is correct.  Other formal gowns migth be able to be cleaned with DRYEL, or similar use-in-the-dryer cleaners -- but this abosolutely GORGEOUS dress needs absolutely PROFESSIONAL care, because of all the sequins and delicate lace.  But for a dress as beautiful as this, it might be worth it.  You decide.
B0083QLQ6K|1|Maybe if you have an itty bitty chest or you're fairly petite -- but definitely no bigger than average.  if you're looking to create for cleavage, though, this will do the job!
B008BDRT98|4|For the price (about $7), this is a great belt.  It has decent construction, suits my needs, and fits true to size.
B00A16PZEY|3|This is a very beautiful belt however there was a problem with the buckle fastner. I ordered other colors and they were perfect but this one was defective, and I had to return.  Runs a bit large. I usually wear a 1X belt and this one fit on the last hole. Somewhat thin but will do the trick if not defective.
B005GVHJZW|5|These are very comfortable pants.  I wish they had a belt loop, but otherwise they are cozy and flattering.
B00MNAL74I|5|everyone love it!
B005GVYOBO|4|I love the shirt. It is light weight and breathes great. The only thing I didn't like was the neckline was way to big, I had to take it up some.
B004MWMLFO|5|Very nice quality, recieved as a christmas gift for my grandpa and he loved it!  It is very well made and attractive in person.
B00DRH75YM|5|Bought as a gift, the person loved it!! It shipped faster than I expected!!
B0099PXZ40|5|Gift for my son, he really liked it.  We're both Walking Dead fans.  Would recommend as a gift or for self,
B00719ZNH8|5|love them
B00EQEJ6Z6|5|I ended up ordering a Plus Size, because everyone was saying these run super small. I'm 5'0&#34; and weigh 117 and the Plus Size fits me perfectly. It's not baggy. I love these so much!  Excited to where them for my cosplay!
B00AYQS6FG|3|I have a 2 1/2, 36lb healthy guy and the white ones fit with room to grow and the printed ones give him major plumbers crack (very low waisted).
B00DHJESSG|5|Got this bathing suit as a gift for my niece and she absolutely loved it! This looks even better in person and so cheaply priced
B00D6KNRKG|4|Great looking outfit!  The top was a good size, but the leggings were a little small. My daughter is ten months old so I would have expected the fit to be not so snug. Overall, I was pleased with my purchase and would purchase this type of product again.
B007NOEWV4|5|The product is exactly as described. There were no surprises. I really like the wallet! It protects my cards from weather (when engaged in outdoor activities i.e. hiking) and it also protects them from getting bent or warped when in my pocket.
B001H0F624|4|This shirt is very comfortable under my work uniform shirt. Much better than a regular cotton t-shirt.Will be ordering more soon.
B00ICOCK4A|4|Love  the suit. Color is great. It fits well however I would have liked more breast support. Because there are no cups it flattens the breasts rather than lifting them.
B001MKVQGO|4|the jingle bells are glued on with a hot glue gun and should be sewn when you get it if you want them to stay in place.  the rest of the costume is really cute.  we plan to wear ours to an underwater party!
B0061JOPVE|5|I love this blouse and receive compliments every time I wear it. The colors are much richer than they appear to be in the photo.
B00D8ILZKU|4|Love it but was disappointed there were no pockets.
B00B93WEVU|5|Product is described accurately. i love the look of it, great material and color as it looks in the picture. Definitely would recommened the product and the seller!
B00BBYPZT0|5|Larry Legend bad ass socks. Comfy too. If you stretch'em then the image lightens but that's to be expected. Still awesome.
B0051EDAAM|5|Just very nice, plain slacks that fit well. So glad to see something made for the &#34;normal&#34; person. Good for wearing anytime; church, meetings etc.
B00H4KAWLQ|4|Love the color
B00HY6RG50|5|These are the best I have ever worn it bought . I always worry if they are too long or too tight . I washed before I wore them and absolutely love them! You should have if you want to  look trim and or dressd up with boots and so comfortable . I'm 5'4 and a medium worked perfect for me.
B00M2QWWZ6|3|These are more like baggy pajama bottoms than leggings. Other reviews stated that these were thick but I didn't think they'd be quite this thick. They aren't made the same way that most thinner leggings are made nor do they fit tightly to your body. They're puffy around the relatively thin  band of elastic at the waist. I can only wear them in the house and with a longer tunic. Other than that...This photo isn't at all what they look like on me and I bought the same size as I usually wear in leggings.
B003X26SBW|4|I bought a 36 size as usual but seems i should have ordered 38 instead as it's a bit shorter than usual.. This doesn't deny the fact that its of extereme high quality
B008G17K26|4|I bought this hat to replace a Woolrich Men's Safari Hat (panama hat) from about 10 years ago. I first re-ordered the Woolrich hat, which I liked very much, but found they have changed the style to a much cheaper hat now (and returned it). After much searching on the internet, I found this Tommy Bahama Men's Panama Outback hat to be the best looking alternative - with the same overall look as my original hat.<br /><br />There are two small issues: First, the hat is available only in combo-sizes of S/M, L/XL or the truly-large single size XXL. My hat size is L (7 3/8&#34;), and so I ordered the L/XL. And of course it is a little large. I had to separately order an adhesive-backed 1/16&#34; thick 1&#34; wide felt strip to run around the inside of the hat (under the hat band) to make it fit. Tommy Bahama should sell this hat in true sizes, not combo-sizes! Second, the Woolrich hat has three ventilation grommets on each side of the crest, and the Tommy Bahama hat has none. This makes the Tommy Bahama has hotter to wear. I use the hat when hiking trails or when working in the sun, so it's important for the hat to be as cool as possible.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice, has the right stiffness, opacity and color; and with the size adjustment I am happy with it.
B00T5GM6OS|1|Way too big on me! Based on the size chart listed and the other reviews I read, I ordered a large, but I am swimming in this! I am 5' 4&#34; tall and 115 pounds. I will need a smaller size for it to look like a shirt and not a tent.
B00553XMRK|5|I read the reviews and ordered a larger size for my back. I kept the same cup size. And it fits perfect.  This bra definitely do the job and it's been the best investment ever. I also bought and wore before there Leonisa Brand,  and still even do I like it, I prefer this new one. It holds way better.
B001RVEPHU|4|Those who know what Gears of War is, would love to have/own one!  Just like Marcus' Doo Rag! BE A COG!
B002NPCJ5O|5|I've tried many brands for my 3 1/2 yo, who chose to potty train early and happens to be very petite. Finding undies to fit that bum and small waist was very challenging. I'm going to guess this brand runs slightly small-up until this order dd was in 2t/3t and now wears 4t, which fit perfectly after washing and drying.  They hold up longer than more expensive brands, too, at a very affordable price.
B00RAZGAFM|5|Very like it. Soft, comfortable.
B00QK5IY7U|5|Love it
B006GD43VC|5|I recommend this seller. I have ordered before and service and quality are consistent. Order was processed and delivered immediately. The quality of the fabric is so soft and drapable. The paisley pattern is delicate and open, and is a nice contrast to the warm beigey background. It looks great with coppery pearls, or brown plaid flannel.
B00G3JEJFE|5|great bra, great fit, excellent quality...
B00ITDW2HE|5|I love it and it looks good on me. :)
B00OE50NHC|4|Super cute coat!  My daughter loves it.
B00DMDZDJA|5|wonderful, that's how I feel in my silky ultra sheer pantyhose with my reinforced toes. nothing like pointing my pretty nylon pantyhose toes into my sandal pumps. so silky pantyhose that I don't want to take my pantyhose off. I could wear my silky ultra sexy pantyhose all day. after a long and hard day my wonderful hanes silky sheer pantyhose make my legs look sexy. take my heels off and leave my pantyhose on. I wear pantyhose everyday and like my tan pantyhose the most. I have no nonsense pantyhose. no nonsense pantyhose I have the most pairs of, I have leggs pantyhose and silkies pantyhose too. but my hanes ultra sexy sheer pantyhose with the reinforced nylon toes are one of my favorite pairs of pantyhose to put on. most of my nylons and stocking pantyhose are reinforced toe pantyhose.
B008ZF8TBO|3|A little on the cheap side and I had to sand down the pin to keep it from snagging clothing, but I like it and it's very unique.
B003YJJKSC|3|I like the product it just didnot match the dress I bought for my wedding when I tried to return them they would only credit me for one pair of nylons when I bought two I returned both pairs and the company will not credit me for both because one pair was open I requested that the company return the open pair but have not heard back from them it has been almost a week since I sent them a e-mail I am happy with my purchases on amazon I am not happy with the company that I made the purchase through
B00CB3IOD4|5|Good marketing experience.
B00RD89H3I|4|Cloth thickness thinner than thought.
B00BMDC2PU|1|I just opened this and it is in horrible condition.  The arrow is bent and the screws holding the bow together are stripped.  Not happy at all.
B00G0PHTVC|5|This is such a great suit.  Easy on and off and protects from the sun.  I think it is true to size.  I usually find that Hatley runs large, but I don't think that is the case with their swim stuff.
B00TIBZ9T4|5|Loved the top.....beautiful
B00JKTCNM0|5|Exactly what I was looking for, for our upcoming Disney trip!
B00G9QRU5M|4|For was great! Very cute
B007RB4P8I|3|According to the product description on this site, these pants are machine washable. According to the tag on the pants themselves, they are dry clean only. There's a big difference between being able to throw them in with my laundry, and having to drive my pants somewhere and pay a few bucks every time I want them cleaned. The pants themselves are cool - very comfortable, and look great with the slim fit. They are a little more shiny than I realized from the picture, but it's not overboard. I haven't decided yet if I'm going to keep them - mainly because I'm not sure if they're worth the hassle and expense of having to dry clean them, even though I like them. This should not be taken as a negative review for the brand - I have a lot of Calvin Klein stuff (at least 1/3 of my wardrobe), and everything else I own is very comfortable and stylish, while also being easy to maintain.
B00BLS4A5Q|3|The shirt design is perfect. However when we ordered mediums I didn't realize we were ordering mediums for uncle Fester.
B002IBZV4O|3|I had the same issue with this bodysuit.  I purchased two (one \\"M\\" 6-9 and one \\"R\\" 9-12). The \\"M\\" snaps never stay together.  The \\"R\\" has no problems. Fabric is good quality and the sizing is accurate though.
B00ACIFP5U|4|These were too hard to not pass up. These are mediums but seemed a bit large and long. No big deal but keep that in mind when purchasing these. For the price, totally worth it.
B00LHO40G8|5|Love it!!!!
B00E9ZW7YE|5|I ordered a medium instead of small (my fault). The top is definitely loose, but not as loose as a medium normally is on me. I'd suggest sizing up if you're busty or don't like your shirts very tight.<br /><br />Otherwise the quality is quite nice!
B008Z83P9M|5|I ordered this for Christmas for my son and he loves it.  The sizes run small.  So if you are a medium you should order large/extra large.  The company e-mailed me and let me know about the size difference.  I was glad I ordered a larger size or it would have never fit.
B004F68JG2|4|I now own three of these bras, because they are very comfortable.  They are not super supportive, but are just fine for normal activity.  The sizing is a little different than what I was used to; I went to their UK website to read about the sizing so that I would make the right choice.
B00H69OTIM|5|great price and a handsome look.  given age of children, I do not have to worry if some are lost.  100 will last a long time
B0048J0BW6|5|Quite roomy.  Nice hat for the money.
B00CSKQKYU|3|thanks
B000N8Q04Y|5|I am a Dickies fan from way back!  (Hey, you know what I mean!)  We used to substitute Dickies work clothes for our issue work uniforms in the Coast Guard (back in the day)because the quality was so much better.  This XLarge size accommodates unusually large arms, necks and ...sigh...bellies very well.  Skinny people may want to go down a size from what they are used to, but they will not be disappointed with their purchase.
B00PUHME8O|5|great little summer dress!
B00NEKAE8G|5|Great!
B00CYAXXVM|5|Knee length socks are difficult to find in stores where I live.  These socks are soft, fit nicely at the top of my leg and wash nicely. Now I know where I can buy them when I need more in the future.
B008OAY9XW|3|This is a thin, sort of elastic feel to it.  I have light weight sweatshirts that feel like regular hoodies - Also, just keep note there is NO white shirt included with it.
B000UH6YQC|5|My son loves this hat as do I. It looks very nice and stays on quite well. He's received numerous complements on it.<br />His first hat was a little big on him but I got it for him when he was only 3 months old and weighed 15lbs as you can see in the picture where he is being held. The size I purchased at that time was called INFANT but I dont believe they call it that anymore. I believe it is the ONE SIZE but I am not exactly sure.<br />I then purchased another one size XS after his first birthday, and I'm purchasing a third one size M today for my busy 2 year old. Love, Love, Love it!
B00075ZXM8|5|Great shirt, wish I had more of them. I have an order for additional shirts.
B00BEFUQNG|4|These shoes are perfect for a little kid who is still growing. The sizing was accurate and the quality is better than expected for the price.
B00CONNDGO|2|The boning is uneaven on one side, and one of the top hooks came off. Not good Quality
B005PXBXS0|5|Great value...my son is slim and these fit him great.
B009S3HYQ8|5|This dress gets 5 stars because it is amazing. I ordered it Thurs night and it was delivered Sat. I am pregnant and didn't really like the maternity formal gowns. I wanted something fun, short so it wouldn't snag on by shoes, short so I wouldn't fall and I wanted something that wasn't constricting on my belly. This dress is all of those things and more. I ordered an 8, which is one size up using the fitting chart because I wanted to have some room to grow into the dress as my pregnancy progresses and my chest gets bigger. It fits so nicely and comfortably. I love to eat and won't have any problems letting my belly expand in this dress and still enjoying the evening.
B00L40RD8W|5|Love it!  Light as a feather, warm, big pockets.  I feel really good in it.
B00ARDCFGC|5|My son has been wearing these socks since he was 8 weeks old and about 11.5 lbs.  They fit him perfectly!
B0044BBSM0|5|I loved this as a nursing bra! Both for day and night. It is super comfortable! And really great for nursing.
B00LX639DK|5|Perfect fit, and perfect colors, just what I expected to get. Thank you amazon, and thank you dockers.
B00LBJEWJO|4|I bought an extra large & had to give it to my daughter. I was disappointed about that. I really loved the color Eggplant & texture of the skirt. Great buy for the money.
B001466UCQ|5|Good quality pin that I wear with pride, ordered several to give to fellow Vietnam vets since we  did not get the warm welcome when we returned.
B00UL7WQKO|3|I ordered a Large.  The bottoms were a Large and they seemed to fit my daughter ok.  However, the top that came in was an XL.  It was too big.  Hopefully, we can take it up enough to make it fit.  The design is very cute, just not a great fit.
B00LVYEQ3G|1|AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL. So cheap. Totally disappointed. Cost more to return than the product. Save yourself!
B007I7ZIJG|5|I've been wearing Jockey brand underwear for around 25 years and even though the styles change, I've gone along with all of them and they never stop being the best!
B00NQ74JHY|4|I love it.
B00SIGDXOS|3|If you are tall and busty this will not fit well. The lines are way off.. .
B00QC5UPSE|2|I was not given the dress in this picture<br /><br />My dress had a zip on the side under the arm and the belt was HIDEOUS !!! NOTHING like the one here!!!
B00598HIXA|5|Very comfortable and fit is just right. Looking to buy a second pair in a different style.
B00DJPN3FM|5|Super cute!
B007K9A3ZG|4|Good
B007AHYA3Y|4|The Touch Tip fingers work very well.  However, if your hands get wet, your fingers will get cold very quickly.  These are made of cloth and don't keep your fingers from getting wet (when you're shoveling snow, for example).
B002HJ3DJC|5|These are perfect for summer weather as liners for your loafers or flats. These cotton liners keep your feet cool, easy to wash and great value for money.  True to size don't shrink up or crunch your toes.
B001B8PKKA|5|I took alot of flack for buying a tux off the internet, but Was blown away at the quality of this tuxedo. The cut and fit of the jacket was perfect. Traditional venting and lapels make this a classic style that will last a long time.  The fabric is very nice and the detailing is what you would expect from a very high end suit. The pants are adjustable so not quite custom but well made and they fit great once altered for length. This is a very good deal.
B00EI3XWZ0|5|Excellent material
B00MXCGN54|5|Fun and pink - without looking &#34;wedding-ish&#34;.
B00NCSQQV4|1|WAY too small!
B00AZNYYB8|5|Fit as I expected; good traction; unlike the other two brands I tried, comes up all the way over my ankle bone (medial malleolus), which I like.
B0033LW82Q|5|this shirt fit was okey it has the expected quality from the brand<br />one of the things i like is the fabric feel
B00APUNZ5W|5|This item definitely had the desired effect. :) It fit perfectly. I agree with a previous reviewer who said there isn't a lot of support so I wore it with a quarter cup bra. I'm 5'4&#34;, 203 lbs, 42D. I'm most self conscious about my belly and this was flattering. My boyfriend LOVED it.
B0033RWY5Q|4|Appears to be well made.  Only just received and will update if any issues arise.  It does smell like leather/stain but that is to be expected and the smell has been going away albeit slowly.  I only with is were slightly smaller but it is exactly the dimensions listed so can't knock it for that.
B00HKUOIDS|5|I love the feel of these, they are really comfortable but I usually wear a medium and I purchased a large, however the large was a little small so I will go to an extra large when I get more of these. I recommend these but keep in mind they run small. It is nice to find men's underwear that is available in many colors and a soft material.
B00GMTEKO0|5|My wife love this shirt......it fit as she expected........she went to a party and all her friends asked where she have order that lovely shirt......
B009G0RQSY|4|I especially like the extra wide waistband. It does fit snugly, as I like it - but go up a size if you are concerned with fit. These are meant to stretch a little though.
B005H3XORG|5|good
B007P896M8|5|Little short
B003ZPIURC|5|Fit great, fast shipping
B006ZH7YFG|1|Sizing is not correct, ordered extra large, delivered with extra large label, but size was a small.<br />Would not order this item again, did deliver in 2 days
B00MXOY3PY|5|Girlfriend likes the belt and thinks it looks good too!
B00IZGF1VO|5|As expected.
B00E3ZOP7M|1|AWFUL!!! Where the piece comes together in the middle there where holes on both side I had to sew up.
B00N3AWMR8|5|I was pleased with this turtleneck until the dye came off on my hands! It was not easy to  remove either. I've never experienced such a problem before---ever! Maybe the one I received was just a fluke, but I won't be ordering from this  vendor again.
B00HWFCUH2|3|Way, way too long; for tall women only.
B00DTXI9K8|5|Returned and correct sized shipped within the next 2 days. Love the shirt!
B00P8793JE|1|Watch out--you may give them a try and see that they are a somewhat decent fit for a cheap boxer, AND THEN you wash them, (carefully mind you, not in hot water) only to find out that they have shrunk enough to become completely too small and unwearable. I'm not exaggerating here, they are seriously 3&#34; shorter in length than the pair I had not washed yet and 2 1/4&#34; shorter in the width. Cheap, I understand, but don't expect to wear them more than once.
B006NZPZ8I|5|The medal of these collar stays are made of works great for me. I got tired of using the plastic ones since they would work. At least I can Bennys back into shape if something happens.
B007PT2MAU|5|Very nice product, fit perfect and exactly as you see in the photo
B00J9QMQRG|5|Excellent quality socks. Husband loved! Very fast shipping!
B00K2DYLJG|4|Very good quality. Small bag
B00J9NRHKU|5|It is exactly as pictured and it looks to be the correct size.  Will be given as a Christmas gift.
B00I808EU2|5|I would recommend.
B00M3S01EM|1|This was the worst swimsuit ever....it looks nothing like the pic and is cheaply made...hey I guess you get what you pay for. I DONT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS!!
B00D8SMOD2|5|I got this because, let's face it, a regular bra smashes down your nips, and it HURTS!  I was looking for something soft and that would provide some support without the nipple smash.  These arrived and I was surprized that there was padding in them, but it was a removable padding, similar to the lining of a bikini.  The shoulder straps are adjustable.  I am a ~34 C/D (pregnant and growing!) and the medium fit well.
B003FORPLA|4|I bought this for my son and he loves it. He wears it alot and it looks really good on him. I would recommende this hat to anyone!
B003C22SN0|5|Wish it was a darker brown but overall it is very comfortable and goes well with the other brown clothing items I have. It is very warm, which is perfect for those cold winter days.
B007W0XVAM|1|I received this a couple of days ago.  I ordered an XXL because I wear a size 18 and 42D bra.  I thought it looked very small when I took it out of the package - so I checked the tag.  Yep, right size.  Must be REALLY stretchy.  So I pulled it on - and in so doing managed to rip the seam joining the lace to the solid colored fabric.  This garment is completely mis-sized - and VERY cheaply made.  Since I had already ruined it, I pulled it up further to see how the top portion of the slip WOULD have fitted.  No way it could contain &#34;the girls&#34;.  It MAY have fit a size 34-36.<br /><br />I can't even send it back because it's ripped.  So save your money - very pretty but certainly NOT functional!!!
B004WPHY1C|5|super cute!
B006JFYVKU|5|Son is very fussy about &#34;bumpy&#34; socks and it has been hard finding him ones he likes.  These work really well.  High quality, thick enough for winter (he works outside).  Will continue to buy these.
B006LHMN6K|5|These really hold you together. very comfortable and they keep you firmly in place, I highly recommend these in every color!
B00E6RC9C0|4|like it!
B00M1L554C|5|The Eileen West jersey knit is very comfortable, does not pill easily, and drapes very well. I always love this brand.
B00O975Q9A|5|One was broken on arrival, but very quick service and replacement.  Looks cute on wrist or upper arm for costume.  Stretchy, so will fit almost anyone.
B00E0L0JBA|1|I received a diferente print.  The fabric is poliester hot, I am totally dissapointed.  Is too big, does not fit. I didnt like it at all
B006T5306G|4|These panties are cute and great for curvy girls especially.
B000K2OFKO|5|Very nice shawl, soft and warm, I tried it and planned to give to my mother as a gift. And bought another silver color one for myself, too.<br />Baby Alpaca!
B00J21KC7E|5|Nice quality and fit.
B00BI62A0I|4|The screen print on the hoodie is fantastic, thick, rich black and has not washed off (we take precaution in washing inside out just in case). I wish it were a bit thicker, but other than that it's great.
B00JWKX5HE|1|What a waste of money!!! The white cloth of the top padding is coming out and no matter how I adjust the padding, it's still popping out. The bottom is small. I'm 5'3 and 109lbs. The lace feels like it's about to give up. Definitely look cheap. Sorry I don't want to give bad review.i just want to be honest for the sake of future customer. The design is actually really nice if only they make extra effort in sewing it properly
B00I1S7D5S|3|The colors are pretty and initially looked like a kids dress. I tried it on thinking no way will this fit but to my surprise it did. I'm 5'2 105 lbs and 32D but it actually fits in the bust because it stretches. I will wear this for casual activities, perfect for a stroll on the beach.
B00HPBG75E|5|Awesome! Fits as I wanted it to
B008S3F1JG|5|GRANDSON LIKED IT FOR CHRISTMAS!
B000P32BBI|5|These really are the softest socks in the universe, I feel like I'm cheating on my cat with these socks.
B00R11MHHK|5|Thank you
B008Q0E8FE|1|Very narrow.Ended up going in the dress up box. The girls love them for that.
B00B8Y2HV2|5|Awesome shirt! It is very good material not cheaply made! A tiny bit smaller than I'm used to but it is still ok
B00LSRU162|2|Too big for a size medium
B00CEHF0AM|3|I purchased this for my daughter. She normally wears a size M... but I noticed by the size chart that the measurements ran a bit small, so I ordered a L.  It was still too small and we had to send it back.  Sad because we both love the top and are hesitant to order an x large.
B00D4N9RW2|5|Fits great... Very slim and long... Although the neck is a bit tight going over the head.. I still love it! It's very warm and comfy
B00J2WHANC|5|I love these jeans, I have 2 pair.  I am 5'4&#34;, 140, very curvy, small waist big hips/butt.  These fit so well, they are form fitting but not too tight.  Fitted at the waist, no gap!
B003JH8T4A|3|The wig is nice the front bangs needed a lot of work. When i tried fluffing it to take its shape like the pic the curls came out.Overall great for Halloween costumes.
B00DYNPH7Q|5|Great underwear. Very soft and absorbent.
B00JFCE62W|5|My son loves this wallet. The money clip being on the inside is a big bonus.
B002698064|5|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it... the size is right on and the product is very nice. Not a thin cheap tee shirt at all.<br />The color is very vibrant and she has already gotten plenty of compliments. This will very quickly become one of her favorites .
B00N2UBE7I|2|The smallest large t-shirt I ever tried on..
B00DEPWMGS|2|I was really excited when I saw this jacket, figuring it would be perfect for Halloween, especially as I'm a die-hard Captain America fan.<br /><br />When ordering, I was concerned it may not arrive in time, but contact with the seller assured me I'd have it, and I do...e-mails were courteously and promptly returned.<br /><br />The cut is a bit tight for a XXL, which if you're going to wear it as a costume isn't all that bad, but if you're going to wear it as an actual jacket, maybe not so much.<br /><br />My biggest issue, and the reason I rated this with 2 stars is the colour of the leather. Everything red in the product photos is ORANGE in my jacket...not orangish-red, ORANGE. At first I thought it was the lighting in my home... but lamplight, dalylight, any light...it's ORANGE.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to be Captain Valencia (orange), this is a good buy...otherwise, save your pennies.
B00BFETJ70|4|Comfortable and fun to wear on the patriotic holidays.
B002LE8I34|4|Quality slacks.  Very nice drape to them. They are quite durable and do not show marks like a splash of tea.  They are not wrinkle-free, but then again, they aren't a mess on wear #3 either.
B000B580O2|3|I was being frugal when I made this purchase, looking for a less expensive hat with neck protection for occasional use. Unfortunately it is one-size fits all, but instead of fitting small heads and stretching to accommodate larger heads, it's an intermediate/large size. Had I needed it for mowing the lawn or taking a walk it would have been fine, but I wanted to use it on the water while fishing and kayaking and it would blow off my head too easily.<br /><br />Had it fit better, I would have given this a 5-star review...it is inexpensive and does the job well considering the price. Unfortunately, I just couldn't use it.
B004LXGXVW|5|Very pleased with the quality of my hoop skirt. I will be wearing it in December for a Civil War Christmas program. It is wonderfully full!
B004ROWTK4|5|The ones that I ordered years and years ago are still holding up, though showing some wear, finally. Just wanted some new backups. Same great quality. Thank you.
B00FXCYO2U|3|Love the vibrant green but this is a very snug XL.
B00FRA3F78|5|Very best ever jeans shorts I have ever owned, will buy some more.
B007PCS06M|5|This outfit is of very nice material and quality.  The colors are bright and the black cat is adorable.  I am very happy with this item.  The purchase was perfect in every way,  Thanks
B00G0Q0GP2|1|Ive never worn it because the top is child sized.
B00EZOB2D6|5|Used as part of an outfit at a bachelor party. Product fitted well on a person who is about an XL.
B00D8VEFYU|5|These fit very nicely and good protection when hiking.
B00LIU2WKW|5|This dress is just crazy-insane fabulous. It just landed on my front doorstep and I ripped into the box and tried it on immediately. It is super flattering and the lightweight &#34;sweater&#34; material does not cling to you and is very nice on your skin. I dont think it will stretch out and look funky after wearing it to work for 8-9 house like some &#34;sweater&#34; dresses can. I am 5'8 and weight about 168 and I ordered a size Large, my normal size as far as S-M-L goes. It fits me like a glove and the hem falls just past my knees and that is exactly what I wanted. I plan on wearing this to work tomorrow with black tights and black heels. I can hardly wait. I paid $20 for this dress and it actually looks very expensive. It also looks exactly as it does in the ad with the model.....exactly. You cant go wrong with this dress!!!!
B00SW997NW|1|It was too large, no shape, and thin material. It looked shapeless on and I have a good shape that makes most things work! Very cheap and not worth buying. I washed it on gentle thinking it could sew it to fit better and the back lacing shredded. Literally just went in the trash.
B00SAEQNMW|5|I'm enjoying my Hoorag. It's very comfortable as well.
B00JGLABYO|2|Cute and OK quality but the XL i ordered was far too small for my frame<br /><br />im a 33 inch waist<br /><br />no room for my boy parts either
B00G33JKNQ|4|The look of the material wasn't what I was expecting but my niece put it on and it looked better.
B00J09KHSC|5|Best little organizer ever!  It can either be used &#34;slim&#34; style, or opens wide to accept larger items.  Either way, it's a great little purse!
B00O8PPE04|2|Not as expected bot ok for price was paid
B007UR3VMA|5|I love this, it's cute and I can't wait to wear this in future con's. I'm going to buy the purple maid outfit too, since I liked this one so much.
B00J7G6CO6|1|So tired of People buying up all the costumes and then charging an outrageous amount for it. So stupid! Thanks alot for keeping my daughter from getting this costume bc of your greed!! Jerk!
B00V5RN0EK|2|The swimsuit would be great for a teen. I usually where a medium. I would need a XXXL for this to be appropriate.
B00G2XF3EC|5|Great shirt from a classic band and album. The design of the shirt is very unique.
B0018T0WPA|5|Oh, there are just not enough superlatives to describe how happy I am to finally own a pair of jeans that fits me. I'm 5'3\\", 135 lbs, muscular and curv-ee through the legs but no butt! These jeans fit me like they were made just for me. I bought a pair in size 5, short--in regular \\"misses\\" I would wear a 4 short, but because these are juniors sizing, I sized up and they are perfect. They look amazing, and I actually look like I have a tush! I'm in love. :)
B0006SCZMC|4|Very nice and durable shirt with a good fit.
B00NIKAYGO|5|I bought a pair of these gloves for both my husband and son.  The gloves are well made and stretch to fit their hands.  I have a pair of UGGs leather/cashmere lined gloves and the Kusheuel gloves are every bit as nice as those.
B00VX1ICPA|2|This dress was too tight  and shorter than pictured.  I would have returned it but I decided because of the cheap price I would just give it as a gift or donate it.
B007WA3PTE|5|Bought this for my daughter on her 14th birthday. She loved it. looks great with leggings and either boots or skater shoes. Came in mail much faster than expected also.
B006L3JK92|3|I looks really professional. My only issue is that the ascot uses Velcro around the back of the neck which in my opinion cheapens a relatively not so cheap looking design.
B000RPUSLO|5|Super cute costume and fit great- not over or under sized.
B00B6E8LRI|3|The bottons were not secure, they actually fell off when trying on for the first time. One button fell off and thought just a defect, then another fell off as well, I have always like dickies, and still do. However, this was a let down and will be returned.
B00NMRD866|5|Love it!
B00PK3VDD0|3|Way to baggy on my daughter. . She will grow into it though
B002F8UU3M|5|This is a beautiful piece. I bought it for my husband as a Christmas gift, and he loves it. It looks great on him.
B00NE918FA|4|Loved it. Fabric is nice and thick.
B0083QLQ0G|5|I'm 36 weeks pregnant and got these because my baby is high and my ribs are spreading and they work great!
B009KM5EQO|4|The dress fits like a glove. The cut is nice and the material has a stretch to it, so you don't feel like a stuffed turckey. The only thing that  will have to do is get the length cut. I am a petite woman. I am 5'2. The dress fall below my knees and I like the length to be above my knee. But if you are of average height. It will be perfect for you.
B00TE8YBPE|5|great shirt
B0065L8OVK|5|my husband loves the shirt. it is a good quality shirt. didn't lose shape when washed either. good deal. excellent purchase.
B009V5GO1Y|3|Good
B00VVMZGVY|5|Fast delivery and product was exactly as described!
B00DI1NYTW|5|Size Junior XL fits me, an adult women's size L.  The color is beautiful.  Comfortable and easy to care.  Love it!
B00TGS3BPS|5|The cotton is soft fits great will definitely buy it again
B008DSL1KE|4|This top is represented well. The sleeves are slightly shorter but not in a freaky way which affected the overall look. The bow will take some practice to tie right but overall this item was represented well and fits nicely. In tops I wear a medium (5'8&#34; 136 pounds) and the medium fit fine which I was worried about due to other reviews that sizing ran small. The material is of decent quality but I am also not one who expects Chanel quality at Ross prices. Overall this top is a cute and inexpensive addition to my wardrobe.
B003543S8E|5|Very comfy
B0002TV526|5|Here in no time and was impressed how nice they were for the price. I'm planning on stocking up for stocking stuffers.
B00BUZXF5Q|5|It came when expected and was good quality.  Would recommend to friends.
B003H6DCBS|3|ok product, slightly uncomfortable but makes a dress lay nicer.  Bit inconvenient if you need to use the lady's room while wearing, it's all 1 piece and the entire thing has to come down, or you can try to use the small hole to avoid pulling down, but not so crazy about that option
B002V5W1WW|5|These pants will only get softer and softer with repeated washings. They might shrink a little, but I ordered a size larger than what I need. Have had a lot of good luck with Cherokee brand scrubs in the past, which is why I chose them.
B000H48G6Y|5|as a responsible truck owner i know that when pulling a trailer i should always wear sunglasses and a hat. that's science.
B003MQMZ66|4|Will be excellent in the dark.  Feet are a bit flimsy for outdoor activity.  Suit is just a tad too short for me at 6'1&#34; but if the goal is a Sasquatch sighting..........this will do the trick.
B003RCUX5A|5|The costume fits perfectly. I am between a small and an extra small (more on the small side), so if you're around the same size, go for it. I am 5'4 115 lbs. My legs are on the shorter side, so the length was short, but not too short. If you have long legs, it might be too short for you. It came with everything but tights and shoes (everything shown in the picture).
B0013K2OJ6|4|Funny costume, one size fits all.
B00PY31H8C|4|Runs a bit big, but I still love this tank! I wear a cami underneath and it super cute and comfy.
B000NA3XQA|4|The first day I wore the shirt the bottom snap came off. They're cheap. The shirt, however is of decent quality and fabric, the stitching is good and straight and the closeout price isn't something I can complain about. I can find the same snaps in my local sewing store and it's a breeze to replace them. Would buy this product again.
B00KY6P8AC|1|Wasn't the product I had ordered at all, was disappointed to say the least. Oh well, some you win some you lose! =)
B0087ZFQG8|5|Love these shorts! Bought on a whim to reach the free shipping minimum. Can be dressed up or down, washes well, breathable fabric and lovely color.
B0086UZU6U|3|The material is too thin for such an expensive price, won't be ordering anymore!! the price is too high for the quality
B006STXOBY|5|Fits great and hugs the body very nice.  I wore to a birthday brunch and heads turned.  I added multiple necklaces and bangles, my hubby could not staring.  I wish it came in every color.
B0007CKLIM|5|My husband wears these jeans.  He likes how they fit and wear.  They do not last forever but when you wash them as much as I do they could not possibly make it forever.
B00CLT3PUU|4|fits great looking to buy a couple other Breaking Bad T-shirts
B00BONNO0A|5|Durable fabric and washes great. Pants can be used with other tops and onsie alone. You won't be disappointed in your purchase.
B007H2L58A|5|It fits as expected. Washed well and was luxurious to sleep in
B00BLV7VJ0|5|Call Of Duty face mask is awesome... fits good and fills comfortable on me. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Call of Duty and plays the game. And Delivery was fast . that was a plus.  : )
B00DFN0NI8|5|Sooo cute!! Just a little big around neck and shoulders.
B00C1KS0RW|5|These little cardigans are figure flattering, beautiful colors, perfect for spring and are great for casual or with a pretty spring dress!!!
B00W332L90|1|Didn't like it at all
B00R5DIYDK|5|Just the right amount of hold for working out without feeling like it is digging in your skin.  And the shipping was super fast.  Will recommend.   i have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased reviews
B00H24S9NW|4|Very cute tee! I bought it specifically to go play zombie laser tag.  I received many compliments.  My only complaint is that I would like it to have a more tapered cut.
B0082MR2QS|4|I love her line, I buy nothing else
B00DXFY8RA|2|I got this corset thinking it would be what I needed to waist train...well it's definitely NOT gonna help in that area...the corset itself is beautiful...however, it is NOT steel boned...it doesn't even feel like acrylic boning...it feels like cheap plastic that bends very easily...it doesn't give you the support of a real steel boned corset...I would send it back but seeing how it took so long to get to me I'm just going to keep it and wear it under my clothes if I go out...but I now have to find another corset to waist train...very disappointed...but at the price I should've known it was too good to be true...
B00Q8R79QW|1|Again the cups were sewn in so high on the out hit it almost looked like polka dots on the top of my chest. So disappointed
B000MX5WPI|5|I am very pleased with this bra.  It is made from quality materials and provides lots of support.  It fits well, is soft, and does not pucker.  The straps are wide and flexible so they do not cut into skin.  A comfortable and supportive bra is very hard for me to find, but this one is great.  I plan to order more soon.
B00HZG0J6W|5|Awesome pants...definitely a spring/summer pant....lightweight...very fashionable....perfect match with a blue dress shirt to pick up the blue stripes in the pants.
B0042LN5F0|2|Hat quality is fine for the price, but the sizing is waaaaay larger than listed. I won't be able to wear it unless I suddenly get elephantitus of the head. Definitely blame the item description. It's one of those things that's too cheap to bother returning too, so I'm stuck with it. Kinda bummed.
B008S1FOV8|5|great deal !!!
B004XJKEUA|4|Cute but the one size is a little crazy. The bottom fits... the underwear are not one size lol more like XS but they will do. The top is really small but I guess it will do. Just getting it to wear in the bedroom
B0002UCESO|1|Should have listened to reveiws.
B00CCY4NSC|4|Very Cute Wig But Color Not True to The Image Shown. What you get is a Hot Pink Wig, Not a light PInk. Other Than that it is a very fun wig...Will be having lots of fun with it.
B002G9UDYG|5|It's a snug hat that delivers great comfort and warmth. While I do wish it was available in more than one size for a better fit, you really ca't go wrong with the Carhartt line. I live in one of the coldest environments on Earth, and I trust Carhartt for my winter survival needs.
B00KZ10UJK|5|LEGALIZE! haha fits well and the print is definitely solid just be careful with washing.
B0014FNOSA|5|These are expensive for my budget but their full cut and quality are what I need for comfort. I'll skimp some place else.
B00TV252GA|4|Nice
B00UCHUERA|5|I really like these. Very cute very comfortable.
B00NL173YQ|1|I was disappointed that this item was too small even though I had purchased an XL, looks more an XS. This ruined my trip,  had to go out and purchase another coat. I would like to return this item. I wouldn't have given any star!
B002NLUGRQ|3|Costume is very funny but fit was big and fabric was cheap.  I could see every fold line/crease.  I'm a sewer and thought I could take this in but I couldn't because all the seams are exposed and sloppy/puckered so it wouldn't be worth it.
B00HYZMNOU|5|Pretty and great quality-- I bought a size 10 for my 8 year old daughter and it fits as expected - it's comfortable
B00C2G3N3G|5|This scarf reminds me of a Monet painting, such soft and dream-like colors. This instantly dresses up every outfit I wear it with, and I always get asked, \\"Where did you get that beautiful scarf?\\"  It is well worth the money!
B00IZA5WGO|3|Seams not finished very well. Fabric already starting to pill and I have only had it a month.  Threads hanging from hem.  Funny since I bought another similar JTC Nightdress in Cobalt-Lotus and Fish Print and it is VERY nice.
B0067LP6V4|2|I really wish this was advertised as a TOP because it's way too short to be called a dress. Wish this company would give lengths of clothes.
B00BGIPRLW|3|I thought the shirt would be tunic style (since it appeared in my search for 'tunic [longer than normal] shirt') but it's almost the same size (maybe a tad longer) as a normal tshirt....I wish it was longer. Oh well.
B00369M1GI|5|I ordered the small, which is the size I ususally wear. It fits big, but I think that's how it's supposed to be, that way you're able to wear a hoddie under it comfortably, which I can. Great jacket, keeps me warm and dry, plus it's stylish, bonus!
B00B4B06W6|5|I purchase for my sister daughter, I love the carter´s clothes really good quality and looks great nice design for boys
B0013G5TDS|3|it's what I needed but the 2x, which is what I wear all the time, is too small. I'm going to try to take out the front and back darts to see if it will fit.
B00HVGXF3K|4|The confection is perfect, the fabric is wonderful.<br />I just recommend buy 1/2 size longer, because you could receive a clothe too Small.
B00E006FAA|5|Very nice !!!
B00O8HRWUW|5|Outstanding style, warmth and value
B00H9BEN6A|4|I love this product. It is great quality and very comfortable. Unfortunately, I ordered the small and it is too large. I am 5'6 and weigh about 135. Normally I wear a size small, but this small is way too big and long for me. Otherwise I would have loved to keep it.
B001V9LO8Q|5|loved by receiver of this gift!
B00IX8LDPC|5|Color is saturated.  True to size.  Super flattering!
B004B8C2CQ|1|It's too small.
B00EGGM6II|5|Buy them all the time
B00HLRPQZO|5|Looks good no bugs in your teeth.
B00HRTZFEI|3|I typically wear a 32D, but the 32DD actually fit me better. The fit/support is great and the cups aren't too padded. I am giving this three stars instead of five even though this is one of my favorite bras. I buy a lot of natori and thought I had found the one style that was the best of all for me. I ordered the cafe color, wear it all the time and absolutely love it. I ordered the grey and could barely stand wearing it for a few hours because it itched so badly where the underwire comes in contact with the skin. I am not sure what is going on with the fabric there, but even with a couple washes, it still doesn't feel great. Very disappointed because I would love to order this bra again. I realize this is not an isolated issue because others are commenting here and elsewhere that this is a problem. Natori, please fix this!
B00329YCEG|4|It's a nice ascot but, the material is kind of hard. So being, it's itchy around the neck, but it's cheaper.
B00NF9I7P8|2|I returned this because the size is listed incorrectly. This is not 1.5 inches/38mm, it is 1.75 inches/45mm.
B002HIJADQ|5|This is great!  My husband has a large head and it fits him well.  It's going to make a great costume!
B00IX5YPK0|5|great fit for toddlers and young kids
B004HZYFR8|5|We bought these owl-theme rainboots for our little granddaughter along with the matching umbrella and rainjacket.  They are just too darn adorable!  They are well-made and durable and not too heavy!  My only word of advice is to order up one size.  Had I ordered her current shoe size they would have been too small.  LOVE shopping at Amazon.com and love to leave feedback, hoping that my feedback will be as useful to someone as others' feedback is to me.
B00ALIOP34|5|I am enjoying the scarf.
B00E9UTM2E|3|A bit tight
B00FX6HWV6|4|Love, love, love this swim suit! I love the color. Most kids swimsuits have white on it and I refuse to get a white swimsuit because it turns yellow after a few uses. It fits good on my 3 year old. She's a little small for her age so the neckline is a little lower than I would like.
B001L6EHGA|2|The shirt isn't official army regulation. The lettering is different and it doesn't have the logo on the back. If you just want a functional army shirt, fine, but get something else if you're replacing lost gear!
B007F0J5JK|5|Good baggies for surfing with a nice stretchy material. The only complaint is that I wish I would have seen these here before I paid over $50 at the local surf shop. Got these for under $15 at Amazon, go figure!
B00794NV5Q|4|I think this is okay..The red scrub top is a little tight on my arms. However, was fast service.. Thanks
B000U7T46O|5|fit mom's swollen feet well!!
B00TTRB3TM|5|I love this outfit! I bought it primarily so my 2-year old could have a lightweight pullover to wear to shield her from the sun when we go to the park. It works great for that, but it is a nice, comfy, cozy lounge outfit as well for cooler days or for traveling. I bought it a little big so that it would be something she could wear for a while and that would be longer on her (sleeves and length) to cover her up in the sun. I only wish they made an outfit like this for adults! I would love to lounge around in something like this! I also love the pale pink color and the khaki leggings. Perfect for a little girl. :)
B002T3MQGM|5|I took a chance on this, made me nervous to buy a bra online without trying it on.  I'm glad I took the chance, this bra looks great and fits great too.
B003Z9SNRU|5|Quality product. Is a little big, but I am pleased with it.  Would buy more in the future. Very nice.
B00EJONDJS|5|My son is still a 5T so he'll have these pants this year and next year as well. They're durable and good looking pants. Sorry, they're &#34;cool&#34; so says my 4 year old.
B00IOQBUHY|5|Lightweight, perfect for my Kindergartener and didn't look like everyone else's bag.
B00T3FPLUM|5|Nice Dress
B00DJC59R0|5|I usually wear a 22W so I ordered the 3X and it fits amazingly. I'm 5'3 so the dress isn't too short on me, it fits like in the picture. The colors are way prettier in person as well. It's a really great dress!
B00L36KBL8|5|Love it
B00XG2V7IS|4|The top neck area is lose and the fabric is not what I expected. It is still a pretty dress. VERY LONGi am 5'6 and have to where heels with this
B0084AW9TS|5|Will be nice to have this in my trunk for those unexpected rainy New England days.  Fold/tucks nicely into one of the pockets that turn into a little baggy to keep it safe and secure and easy to grab whenever I need it.
B001418JRK|3|ok i ordered this wallet because i needed a new one and was so excited when i got it then i opened it up. theres room for cards inside the wallet but when you put a card in it almost feels like its to big and does not hold money well that being my biggest problem of the hole thing and my last word the inside of the wallet has a pink cheetah skin in it
B000VK4352|5|Much nicer than expected, fit very well and washed up nicely. Comfortable and really great price. Very very pleased, will buy more!
B007ZYVFWG|3|I had sky-high hopes and that was my problem. The top kinda made me lose my small waist/ wide hips/ hourglass shape that I love. Instead of complimenting it. In the picture, it looks like the middle part would hug the waist a little bit, but it doesnt, it kinda fits like a poncho (I realize thats what it says) but the picture makes it look so good. Maybe I should have ordered a size down. :( Anyway, if you get the right size you should be happy with it. I waited a couple months to write this and so far the material has maintained its new-ness. No snags, rips, or tears. Lace hasnt shriveled up like I thought it would. Then again, I dont put lace in the dryer, and you shouldnt either. Hang it up on something to dry.
B0085KEVCK|4|The colors are vivid, and the fabric is very light and comfy.  The small size isn't small enough (I would have ordered x-small if available) maybe because it's made for mature women. I'll take in on the sides to make it fit better.  I'm 5'6&#34; and weigh about 123.
B00D05J562|5|I ordered this bra b/c I saw it in a department store.  The color is beautiful and it fits nicely.  The problem was the way it was shipped.  I returned it twice b/c both times it was folded in half in the shipping box which caused dents in the molded cup that would not disappear.
B000644BOQ|5|Great item.  They were a presant to my husband and he loves them.  He especially likes not having the heavy X in his back..
B00DE7DH3S|5|Nice
B00HG2G7SE|3|This dress is too short waisted for me, I'm 5'7&#34; and 140lbs, this hits me just above the waist making the lower 1/2 of my body bulbous. I wish it was more flattering, but it's not. I would recommend for those 5'5&#34; and 120 or less.
B00LMDYIVQ|5|Came super fast and since then my son will not take it off . Beautiful colors, we'll made. Perfect for a Dead pool fanatic! !!!
B009WO1S4W|5|I have a couple of these and they are hot, sexy, and comfy!! will definitely get compliments from men and women!
B005NYVPRK|5|Ran true to size and kept my babies fair head sunburn free for hours. Also very cute hat that is reversible.
B00XKY1OTE|5|Husband loves these jeans for work
B00STX4H22|4|I like the bright yellow tank. It was a little smaller than expected, though.
B000FEM3JC|5|I was looking for something to throw on over short-sleeved onesies during those cool summer days, or days when the house, at least, was cool. This is a wonderfully comfortable, light-weight jacket that keeps my sons warm in moderately cool temperatures, without overheating them and doesn't interfere with their play time.
B00H6BVSKC|5|Great fit and support!
B00KBZQUCQ|4|It fits just a little larger then other Hanes t-shirts I have had.  There is no elastic around the cuffs of the sleeves so if the sleeves are too long you have to roll them up.  The material is a lighter weight which I really like.  I am happy with them.
B008F55KN4|4|Bought for my son and they fit well at first. Compared to underwear we bought at walmart, these are a little smaller than the same size at Walmart. Overall, it was worth the purchase
B0043GTHFG|5|LOVEEEE
B00F5VPAKY|1|Runs SMALL SMALL SMALL!!!!  I purchased a 14/16 for my 12 year old in hopes it would last a few years.  It did NOT even fit!!! but soon learned that it actually fits my 7 year old ---
B00DF3K97S|5|Great product, great price! I ordered this for a photo shoot for my 9 month old and it looks great!! Also, SUPERBcustomer service! 10/10 for the item and customer service! More companies should learn from small businesses practices like this!
B00BJDLXQC|5|I am 5'7&#34; and 38D with a torso that I dont consider long but it doesnt fit in most storebought shirts. Tunics are more flattering on me. I bought 4 Patty sweaters in XL; they come out of the box looking verrrry long but once my curves are covered they sit just right on my hips. No see thru but you couldnt stand outside in just these sweaters in say 50 degrees. Arms are perfect length to keep wrists and bottom of hand comfortable. Seem to hold shape throughout the day and night too.
B001CVG140|5|this outfit was hot i bought it for someone special and she loved it and it looked great on her
B00GISO7WA|4|Great hat! My 10 month old son's head is in the 97th% so I was worried about the size, but it fits him now and should last through the summer. Adjustment on the back is great and works well. It's a little tricky to tie way son trying to pull it off, but aside from that it's great!
B00FFFB1ZI|5|I bought this product the first time and originally it was way too small. I'm a size L or XL and I had to go all the way to an XXXL in this product. Runs very small. Great returns and no problems with that. Great product! Very well made and does the job good! Highly recommend.
B00J7L68Q8|5|I love this it's super cute! I love how it looks on me
B00M1IFM98|5|This dress fit as expected and I can't wait to wow  people with it.
B00CSYT4JO|4|I'm 5'3&#34; and ordered a small and it fits nice-- the chest is a little big but not noticeably so. Used for a dance piece and I'm very happy with it!
B000N3Q6V6|2|The rise both front and back is much less than what it used to be . I find these pants uncomfortable , but I guess that's what everyone is wearing . Youth obsessed America !
B0056IUOFM|5|So cute, soft and comfortable!
B00D3V140S|5|THIS IS A VERY NICE JACKET AND COMES AS EXPECTED<br />EVERYTHING WAS FINE: COLOR, FABRIC QUALITY AND SIZE.<br />I LOVED IT.
B00GQVC3Y8|5|Excellent value
B00GL2HEAU|5|I am usually between a M and L, due to broad swimmer's shoulders, and a narrow waist.  I would normally say, depending on the clothing's cut and fit, I'm between a 6 and 10, but not always an 8.<br /><br />I opted for the M and lucked out.  Fit perfectly, I cuffed the waist's hem under.  Looked great and performed well in a sweater contest in Afghanistan.  The back is black... wish it had the back end of the reindeer, but really can't complain!  Did not stretch out after all day wear.
B00A65Z6AI|5|They are so comfy and warm
B00CI5KKJQ|3|fabric is not soft
B0007YR8W2|5|Matched description. Shipped fast
B00B1PFLBG|4|got these for my husband for his birthday, in his regular size, 33. way too big, so returned them and got a size 32. still large! better, so i'll wash them and he'll tie the laces closely. but beware--these run big. would have given 4 stars but for the sizing.
B00W2M8LHS|5|These are fantastic pajamas - sized for a boy, but styled like men's. I bought these for my son who needed them for a theatrical production, but I think he likes them well enough to use them after the play. The quality is very good. This type of pajama is nearly impossible to find in a department store. Thankfully, I found them on Amazon.
B00PW23RPG|5|Im rock girl and short skinny, it is Amazing unique dress, perfece material, so cute!! LOVE it. ----Im ordered M size
B00C40ZYH8|5|Love love love it!!! Can't wait til my little man can fit it.
B00K1B2JUW|5|Well loved, super comfy. His only complaint is he wished they had pockets.
B0080IBOGS|4|The quality is fine, I just misjudged the size.
B002LN0D7E|5|These are some high quality pants.  Dockers D2 is my go-to dress pant, and unlike a lot of brands, Dockers hasn't gone down in quality over time, they've actually gone up.  The British kahki is nice, but it's a little darker than I was expecting.  Think more of a blended sandy caramel color, rather than a manila tone.
B00E7PYVLI|5|These are the only high quality gloves I could find to fit my tiny hands. My ring finger is a size four.
B00H3Y7VV2|5|My husband loves these jeans!! They fit perfectly. Great price for a great pair of jeans that lasts! Comfortable! Will def order more for him.
B0057IUTRO|4|This has pockets within pockets and since this is my first tactical vest (purchased for non tactical use) I can only assume that is what is expected of such an item. Some pockets are very deep, others are fold-out and others have inner pockets for clips, who knows what and so it would be quite easy for a wearer to loose something inside one of these splinter dimensions. I couldn't find a suitable casual vest that I could use as a windbreaker and some storage and the fishing kind have more natively bulbous pockets and hooks and loops and things for tackle that I don't need. I do wish the lower waist pockets (that can unzip from the sides for your hands) didn't have mesh as the inside &#34;wall&#34;, instead of the same material used for the outer shell - easy to snag something. Does repel rain well, doesn't feel too hot in 90 deg.+ F weather and the XL fits well where as others have reviewed that sizing has been a problem.
B00GN6IY44|5|this leggings is very cute! excellent quality, a little longer for  size 5, but is good because it has room grow! the color is exactly as pictured, my daughter just loved!
B002VKHDZ2|5|My four year old was so happy when Santa brought this jacket.  The inner fleece makes it even better than a rain jacket.  Wish I had purchased one years ago.
B00JM93O7Q|4|The shirt is exactly what my nephew wanted. It fit well too.
B00G9NBROK|5|Very Happy with the &Iacute;tem...
B001JPH6XE|4|Not the most flashy or newest design, but they are well made, priced well, comfortable. Sleek, no pockets. Not baggy. Wear to gym on regular basis. Have in several colors.
B00FEJ6TIE|5|I really love these yoga socks.  I have tried another pair that was cute and protect against slips but they were uncomfortable/too small/ they go between your toes like gloves. Pros. Great Soles Yoga Socks are comfortable, protect against slips, love the white color,  and super easy to clean even without bleach. Con: if they were just a little bit larger they would be perfect beyond 5 stars.I was offered this product at a reduced price however,  this is a unbiased  review and it is solely based upon my usage of the yoga socks. I would definitely recommend it.
B00FAQLTWC|2|Great!  Exactly what I expected!
B003A0SF6I|5|This is sooo soft and comfy! It also looks much better in person.   Very glad to add to my collection and even prouder to wear.
B00NVAN788|5|I LOVE IT
B0017RWBLQ|4|ok quality for what i paid for it.  It won't hold up under heavy use/abuse but is acceptable as a novelty.
B00QF7L8G2|3|I read the reviews and ordered the largest one that I could, and it came at about a US medium. Other than that, about what you'd expect...a little scratchy, but it's not couture.
B0012YQ6J2|5|I have tried many shoe pads in my life, and these are by far the best! I picked these up when I saw them for half price at the pharmacy. I highly recommend these pads if you have diabetes or neuropathy or sore feet! I have neuropathy and I have to stand all day at my job. All the gel pads I have tried hurt my feet. These are a dream! They strike the perfect balance between comfort and support, and they are the only pads I have found that will support my high arches and take pressure of my heels and the balls of my feet. The pads are quite big. If you are buying these for anything smaller than tennis shoes then order one size smaller. When I buy a new pair of shoes, the first thing I do is tear out the pad that comes with them and insert a pair of these.
B008P0FCB4|5|I ordered the bright/neon'ish green shirt and I only paid $6.60. I love it. Got it within 2 days of ordering. This is a great shirt. I'm not a neon color type of person but I will be wearing the crap out of this. lol. Thank You Amazon!
B00IKXY8FM|5|Gear fit
B003DVH24U|5|The packaging for this tie was great and secure. The tie itself is of great quality. It is of medium thickness at the tie-point and looks very modern when tied in a standard Windsor. Would for sure recommend.
B00V5FP9DM|5|Good fit.
B00E6F7BHK|4|This patch was exactly as described. A fun gift for the mycologist in my house. I would buy this again.
B00PDIKEX2|5|I LOVE this pair of capris the reviews said  they run small so I ordered on size up, fit great what to order another pair
B000FQEB5E|4|But I ordered up to XL and it is great!
B005FIHH8A|5|This is a wonderful cost effective set.  I got a green one too.  In time a may buy more.  It would be nice if Amazon could some how get this set with &#34;puff ties&#34; as well as bows.
B000WNVFHM|5|Love it.
B00YGXWFQY|1|Way way too small. I am tall and skinny so I ordered the large it is long enough but way too tight when it looks like it should be a loose flow shirt. Waste of money.
B00TZ12XE6|1|Pretty, but Disappointed in size, runs very small 😞
B007VB3DMI|5|excellent
B00UPGHXYK|5|Very nice fit. Material is very soft, extremely comfortable, and not too thin, which I see a lot of with similar shirts. Couldn't be happier!<br />Oh, did I say that it's comfortable?  :)
B00IO9JCY4|2|I expected &#34;Hanes&#34; to offer a thicker sock!! See my other review. Poor quality. Not even worth the price I paid.
B00C2E6FTM|5|I joined a Royal Tea Society. Most people wear hats. I don't own a hat because I do not look<br />good in them. I looked on the internet looking for this type of small hat.I saw this headband fascinator on Amazon.<br />The price was great, the reviews were good, so I decided to order it.<br />I was amazed how well it looked. I have short hair and was able to hide the headband and it looked terrific.<br />It is very well made, nice quality and the price was fantastic. Now I can wear this. Very Happy.
B001T6HAP2|4|nice and supportive, i like the under wire outside
B00JRZ5AAO|5|I have been shopping in about every store in town, just couldn't find the perfect infinity scarf for my neice, who I want to send who lives in Europe. This scarf is priced very reasonable. Arrived in time. The colors are gorgeous. The fabric is very solft and silky the picture is exactly how the scarf looks. Very light weight. beautiful design where its two different patterns. Very happy. I want to go back and look at the other colors now!
B00YBMW5J2|5|Love this sexy pinup style bra. The gorgeous cage strap detail and sexy lace is very frisky! It fit perfectly. Love the eyelash trim detail. If you're torn about sizing, I would size down as there's alot of give in the band. I love this bra. It's one of my favorite pieces of lingerie, not to mention my husbands. It's stunning. *sample provided to review
B007ZGDEDM|4|This was an awesome little stocking stuffer for Christmas - and such a great idea for a product.  The silver and leopard print is so cute and stylish, and although the mirror / compact part is a little on the small side, it's better than not having anything at all.  For the price this item is fantastic - I've seen similar ones for $30+.  I bought this as a gift, but liked it so much I got one for myself.
B002KE5NKG|3|These retail for $42 on CKU's website.  I've been eyeing them for awhile, because I love there micro steel style, and when they had a sale, I bought a pair.  Since these were more expensive, I would assume they'd fit and feel even better.  Not even close.  These pair ride up more, don't feel as soft as the micro's, and are more uncomfortable.  Not exactly sure why they think they can charge more for that.  They aren't terrible though.  But if I had to choose, I would def go with the micro steels instead.
B00JWZAABI|3|Was sall in lenght
B00ESIGZH2|4|My dad LOVED this jacket.  Great weight & style.  Bought XXL but seemed small to me - hope we don't have to return it
B008HNJAOO|5|This sweater met my expectations and op polnstyu size and quality and on a discount price! Recommend as a pleasant shopping!
B00D2UO59C|5|Great look, great fit & Jack Daniels branded. Perfect.
B00B1NL9EQ|5|i love it i ordered a small cause i am small and barely have boobs and it feels and looks beautiful i love the design i will be ordering it again hopefully in black
B00EPIUN2S|2|This item is warm! They are not quite long enough, Clearly, I am taller than the model pictured. I could not find info on the inseam before purchasing this item, so I crossed my fingers and hoped. I am 5'6&#34; and 112lbs, so I bought the S/M size. These end above my ankle, (by about two inches) They will be okay to wear under my Jeans as a layer on those super cold days, but, with the hole that was in the seat of these pants I am not too sure how long they will hold up. I would return them, but it just really isn't worth the hassle for the price. Also, these are much thicker than I expected for the price, and they are soft. So, as long as you are shorter than 5'6&#34; or don't mind capri length leggings, then they are an awesome deal. They just won't work so well for me, with a quarter size hole (there before the leggings were even worn) in the buttox and them being too short. The extra fabric is nice at the bottom, but again, comes to where my foot begins rather than going over my heal as seen in the picture.
B00G20WYWY|4|provides nice cushion for Pickleball.
B001QJPM8Y|5|This button down is great! It's very good quality.  It shipped on time and was packaged nicely. If you are a fan this is a great buy!
B001NZTT0S|2|I wear a 46DDD in a regular bra, this bra wouldn't even come close to meeting around my body. Very disappointing.
B001KS0V0A|1|It just wiry
B00D437EMW|5|The snowsuit fits well and it looks great.  Or my granddaughter makes it look great.  In any event, great color, good look, good fit.  Seems like it will be perfect come cooler weather.
B00H6P1Q4G|3|some what large waiting very looooooong for an exchange !!!!!!!!
B005OORQ1S|3|The coat was much thinner than I expected. It is not a great coat if you are looking for warmth.
B00E0G2ZG2|5|The magnetic closer is what I love. It was so easy as a first time mom with a lil tiny awkward fragile NB.<br />Easy for diaper changes especially in the middle of the night when you are half asleep.<br />Material is pretty soft. Could be softer but then again I am a material snob :).<br />Wash - It washes well.. got faded later after many many washes.
B00M59JAPU|4|Great sweater Zipper need beefing up
B00P55E63C|3|too tight around calves.
B00MFQQ6NM|5|It was exactly what my husband was wanting
B006CUPEVM|5|These are my favorite tights but buy a bigger size to be on the safe size. Maybe i'm just too curvy for the tights but certain parts fit weird and I wish I would have gotten a bigger size to make up for this. Over than that, these tights are durable and destined to turn heads ;)
B00415C7RY|5|Love the footies!
B00KIGABXC|5|Cute item. Just as described.
B00MY60H74|5|Bought it for my sisters girl friend. She loved it.
B004U0IRGU|5|These gloves are a great addition to any dance or spinning routine. They have multiple flashing modes, three colors (green, blue, and red), and the batteries seem to last quite a while as I haven't had to replace them yet and I use them every day for about an hour at a time.
B001RKYIDC|5|Buy these shirts and ware them until they become rags which takes forever. Long and short sleeve are wonderful.
B00GGZYC5C|1|Horrible..
B000MX3U0W|5|If you thought you were doomed to wear bras that are stiff and/or wired because you have a larger cup size think again. This is the perfect everyday bra. Comfortable all day long, smooth seamless and easy to fasten too. I just ordered 2 more.     Nice to see some good quality bras for women who don't want to wear their 'mom's' bra just because they have a larger cup size.
B001KAQ3U0|5|fits well, can wear on multiple occasions
B00F973934|4|The sweatshirt is great but the test will be when it is washed i.
B00EN73WE2|5|Looks great on and quality is great.
B00MEH1S2Q|5|love the samcro hop supper cool looking!
B00JPNIA8M|5|This dress is beautiful, simple top with a big pop of color on the bottom. Great style!
B00GXU3KLM|5|Very good!
B006FYKRW6|4|Love the fabric but will order smaller size next time. Too big! Cant wear under scrubs but can wear casually, even tho big.
B0045KD9WM|5|True to size. Really warm. Exactly as described. Gave as a gift for my boyfriend and it was perfect. Thanks.
B00HB2EFGU|5|Pretty!
B009JAX7XO|5|Soft, sexy and fit perfectly.  Would highly recommend this pair of panties. Love the lace around the backside.  They didn't stay on long
B009T5LEEI|4|I ordered this for my husband, be is an US size M but this size L fits him perfectly, so beware because their sizes are smaller, but other than that is great, nice stitching, nice material, nice cut, nice modern fit.
B00J3370NA|5|Love it
B00M3AG036|5|Fit perfect
B00OI1PEP8|5|As difficult as it can be dressing a toddler, Peekazoo Tees help make it fun! My youngest daughter (3) loves picking out her &#34;Animal of the day&#34; and my older daughter (6) loves the educational facts printed on the back.<br />Being the mom, I love the &#34;made in USA&#34; and soft feel of these tees. They have a more modern style line and fit. Definitely not a cheapy kids tee.<br />With all the compliments we've gotten, I have now begun gifting Peekazoo and so far, everyone's happy!
B00T9KGYIE|3|I ordered an extra large, expedited shipping (cost about $25, I was in a hurry). It is very very small fitting. Decent quality but very small fitting.
B00NRCFCZG|4|Fast shipping good item
B0081P7PD6|4|I love it.
B002WUQCQC|5|Smart looking Star Trek t-shirt! I'll enjoy wearing this shirt!
B00A793T6G|5|These look awesome and feel great. Highly recommend!
B00BBW9NQI|1|I ordered this shirt, it's got great reviews, today I got my order however it was not the shirt instead it was a neon green tank shirt and a navy blue v-neck shirt.
B0007QMNV6|5|Best minimizer bra ever.  100% true-to-size.  Doesn't smash you down; rather it lifts and separates with zero padding.  It says &#34;minimizes size, not shape&#34; and means it.  I now have bought four of these.  My ample buhzooms look fabulous - perky but not overwhelming, and I'm a DD cup on a small thin frame.  Nicest bra I've ever owned.
B00N0S9MVM|5|my son loves this pants;;
B00LSV54SS|5|The dress is beautiful. It totally met my expectations. The fit was almost spot on with the exception of my shoulder area it was a bit big. Highly recommend this dress.
B0075QT062|2|eVogues Plus Size Sheer Cropped Bolero Shrug.<br />nothing is wrong with the quality and the sewing details. For a 3X it just to small.
B00GJOT5LQ|5|Comfortable fit. Great for layering instead of traditional undershirt. Purchased several.
B00817E046|5|good
B00QIDJI4C|3|cute. but the lace on top does not stretch on my calf. perfect for skinny legs. I do not have huge calves but they are too big for this boot cuff :(
B006EVCT2Q|4|Its perfect the ponytails arent that bad at all. They are perfect. My other miku wig WAS very long and light blue and it tangled REALLY EASILY. The base of the wig needed to be trimmed. Perfect fibers. Very soft.
B006XFJY4E|3|it is so good and as i expected.
B00ZWNM8R8|5|nice summer socks ... think it was a 10 pack, variety.  Great for hot days
B00GOG5XM4|5|I didn't really believe in the other Bellroy wallet's little pull-tongue thingy, so I chose the classic style wallet. Very nice packaging, and great designed wallet from premium materials. Very very slim. Very satisfied so far.
B002BX3BNW|5|The windshirt is what I was looking for and it came as described. I use it almost every day and am planning on purchasing another.
B00CR4I8CE|5|This top looks great with leggings. Very soft and pretty colors. Sheer sleeves make the top cool too. Very happy
B007T5L2T2|4|definitely not for tall people but its a great bargain!The boots are a little silly, but necessary to pull off the costume.
B00GLSHD64|5|grear
B00369M1GI|5|Columbia always delivers, and this jacket is no exception.  Like some others have said, it is not a heavy coat, but can provide warmth if you bundle up underneath it.  Where I live its never really too hot or too cold, and so this jacket is perfect. I commute to school on my bicycle and this jacket is perfect for riding and whatever the weather offers in fall and spring.  Size for me ran true to the size chart.  I ordered a small (according to size chart) and it was exactly what I expected.  If you like a coat that is a little baggy, go with one size bigger than you would normally.  You will not be disappointed if this is what your looking for!
B00B8PDTZY|5|It came very quick. Took about a week for delivery. It's the size of your palm and it's pretty heavy for a keychain but whatever. It looks just as presented. The little logo at the tip of the sword is painted a dark navy blue that You don't really notice but that was nice. If only it was red though. Mine has a few dents in it but that's okay. The one thing that was just like what, was the way they delivered it. The bag it came in came a bit short so their solution was fold the package in half... Didn't get damaged but still....no.....
B0087J767Q|4|This was a great outfit for my son when we went to the renaissance fair. It is a little tricky to get into because the cape is actually attached to the tunic, but otherwise is fine. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the need to put it on with some help and if the child tries to do it themselves you may fine that you need to reattach or reinforce the stitching of the cape to the tunic. (like I did) My son didn't like the head piece, it made him hot in the summer heat, but for Halloween he wore it but still with the hood piece down so that it was just around his neck. Personally I think it looked best around his neck. Overall very nice.
B00K1I5TT8|5|It's very cute and I do love it however it is somewhat bigger than what I expected it I be.
B00ACIGWJI|5|These are great but I should've ordered the XL.  It's all personal preference though.  I don't like my boxer briefs super tight.
B00IKMD1JM|3|I like the product but WAY TOO SMALL! It's labeled as a Men's 2XL, it's more like a Men's Medium.
B007RFT67Y|5|Being a tall guy these are the best fitting ever just slow shipping.
B0099U2UDC|5|My wife loved getting this as a gift.  Glad we bought it.  Seemed just a tiny bit smaller than normal.
B00APBGCD8|4|Nice to find something with style. Excellent quality but runs a little small.
B00RHBK1KO|5|I like these I can wear them everyday which is good.
B00MIMHYN4|1|Not happy. Wore them one time and they bled and ran...look terrible...asking for refund...
B00OFR8OPW|5|Daughter loves it wearing it a Christmas performance.
B002EVPMUQ|3|I have other Perry Ellis boxer's and the large size fits fine, but this one is much smaller. I can wear them ... but they are not as comfortable as my others.
B00SCNCSO8|4|I'm satisfied I can see a difference already. Only thing that I am not happy with is the wire only on one side it folds  in my  back. Other than that  I will keep  buying them  works for me.
B005FDUS9K|4|I like these Thorlo socks. They are very cushiony and they don't fall down, unlike another pair of Thorlos that I bought at the same time.
B00KHR1W9E|5|Looks really nice on. But runs really small. I ordered my 4 year old son a 6 and it will only fit for this season, it fits him nice though, not snug, but also not a lot of room to move around
B000U0DH8C|5|I bought them solely for the purpose of their function to free my fingers to effectively manage paperwork.  I am secretary for a group where we have to wear white gloves during the meeting.  I purchased these gloves to stay within the dress code; and they allow me to expediently perform my secretarial duties. They serve that purpose well.
B006L3L1T4|4|One suggestion: include instructions on how to tie a BOW TIE.  Our previous tux sets included a pre-tied bow tie (Nordstroms, N-M, Brooks, etc).  Imagine our surprise when my husband had to google &#34;how to tie a bow tie&#34;. Quite the chuckle, but including instructions would be nice for those 50 and under.  Great quality product, well stitched.
B00F4ODNL0|5|Super stretchy, so it really will fit almost any size. The fishnets were kind of annoying on the toes as they don't have a fabric runner/hem to keep your toes from popping out and being uncomfortable. But it's super sexy
B00D7UXYYE|5|I like this very much, and am going to use it mostly when travelling, as a going-out card carrier.  Nicely crafted, and as advertised!
B00JU6LHO8|5|Love the lilly dress
B00CALRAJG|5|I bought this dress for my toddler daughter. She absolutely loves it and the dress looks amazing! very classy! The material is really soft and comfortable. Would recommend 100% and the seller and service is superior!!! will shop again!
B00BB0YCQ6|5|Terrific love CJ Cookie jeans they are the best of the best.
B000I1G1KY|5|Great fit, true to size, gives great support, comfy, one hand clip works perfectly fine, will definitely buy another after looping months of trying to find the perfect bra for nursing
B00DZEPJ22|5|I've been wearing this super comfy sweater nonstop since I got it in the mail last week. It's perfect, not too hot but warm enough. Really breathable. It's perfect to wear when you're sick. I love that it comes with a big pocket on the front since I usually wear skirts and dresses that don't have any.
B003DXIQ7U|5|I missed the slouch socks from the eighties and was thrilled to find these.  I didn't have high hopes that they would be similar to the ones I remembered from so long ago, but they are terrific.  They are high quality and comfortable.  Though not as baggy as I had hoped, they are very nice.
B00ACIHDU0|5|This items was for my grandson & he was very please he love the fit. Thank you
B00I3IE1D8|4|Just what was ordered
B0099OZGRA|5|fuzzy, warm, comforting.  a little thicker than the cheaper kind. great for cold weather. they wash and dry nicely and are still soft after washing. I wash and dry inside out to protect the little grippers on the soles.
B000OVB69Y|5|I bought these for my wife and she loves them. They fit true and do not bleed on washing. The fabric is good quality and we're, both, very happy with our purchase. We actually went ahead and bought 3 more in different colors! Will definitely buy again.
B00CM49NIM|4|Nice!
B00GGBLE2A|5|This dress fits like a glove! It is beautiful, feminine and hugs my curves in all the right places. I love it. It fits even better than I expected.
B00B280V6W|5|Work great for intended purpose
B0042VK6WK|4|i bought these to try out because i got them for a good price. i like these as much as my levi's 501s, but these stretch a little so i guess at times they're more comfortble. great jeans!
B001L9UM6G|5|This has great compression,30% spandex! Really compresses for the truncal swelling and them as a bonus smooths all the lumps and bumps left over from the mastectomy.
B00I8N1J2E|5|I just received this camisole today and have only tried it on, but it really is pretty.  The medium fits just as expected, and the lace is quite flattering.  I will use the &#34;hand wash&#34; feature on my washing machine as I do with all delicates.  I plan to make additional purchases for Christmas gifts.
B000G7CDAW|2|Stiff as expected even after 4 washes. If that is what you are looking for these are for you. Waist seemed like it was off a size or so. Order 1 size larger on waist
B00F3BRMDY|1|upon receiving this item it was broke.I was very disapointed. the belt was very nice.i the prong was broke and it cost to much to ship back and fourth so I did not bother.
B005CSOMHM|5|Better quality than my +$50 Izods.
B00D68PRPQ|3|The size was good. The pants and shirt are common, but the pink bag is of poor quality. My granddaughter likes it, anyway. No her mother.
B00W5TC5F2|5|Finally one that is not too long!!
B008SCK610|5|Had to exchange one shirt becaus I ordered the wrong size - sent it back priority and hope to have the repalcement by next friday - am going on a cruise.  Will update up0on receiving my exhange.
B004616O0Y|5|fit perfectlly
B00DLNLVGK|5|These are wonderful - our baby scratches his head and ends up scratching himself to bleeding ... we loved these!
B00OGLT0XM|2|this shirt runs EXTREMELY SMALL!  I normally wear a large or 1x as i am heavy chested, when I saw comment about this running small so i order a 2X (figured i can always  shrink in the dryer)  the shirt is VERY short, and tight, 2xl for teens maybe...  Should been labeled Kids not womens clothing!
B00EDO9WWQ|5|I love this sweater. The wool is very high quality and it beautifully made, it's a nice creamy ivory color with a very nice fair isle pattern at the top, and the bottom isn't banded, it's straight across which is very flattering.
B00GW8159E|5|Very satisfied
B00CVK7Y1K|5|I think the shirt Is of really good quality and it worked perfectly for the July holidays
B00MS9HA5E|5|A cute little bikini that has been a hit with customers of my glamour/boudoir photography business on the Spanish , Mediterranean, island of Ibiza. My customers , who average 100-125lb., 5ft.4in. to 5ft.7in., 34C or 34D bust, all look great in the 'one size' fitting and are very complementary about the fit and colour. A super bikini for showing off a good figure.
B00GWV598Y|5|Beautiful sweater!!
B00OV7VB1A|4|The dress is not the same color as it is online. Thought it is still pretty. My daughter feels like a princess in it. Love it
B002TJKFRI|5|great hat looks very sharp and isnt like a plastic halloween costume hat. good quality
B00IUOU61Q|5|This dress fits and looks fabulous as I expected ... I'm so excited lol but great dress I recommend
B000KEOZIY|5|Best pair I have ever owned. Fit well and extremely warm. Would highly recommend these to anyone who works outside.
B002HL5GKE|5|excelente
B00EZGWXCS|5|Great color and Fit. It is slim but the materials used in it give it some slight bagginess and allow you to move comfortably while still having the modern, slim/classy look. Compared to GAP Authentic Skinny jeans these fit a little looser around the calf and leg opening area. One of my favorite pairs of jeans.
B00MPZCG3M|5|good item and fast delivery service thanks
B004LRO45K|5|I'm 5.3 and it's a little big too long.but other them that it's perfect. Love it!
B008NJOTBQ|4|Yes my Brony son asked for this for Christmas. Well made and he is happy with design as it is not overly feminine.
B00KDOR1E6|5|these pants are so comfortable. they have a stretchy material that is similar to the feeling leggings with just a thicker fabric than leggings. the zipper in the back is totally unnoticeable and the pants fit great. the waist line is very complementing. I am 5'5 and a size 2 and the waist line goes just above my hips. they are very complementing to my figure. you cannot even tell with the zippers that are on the bottom of the pants and you do not even notice they are there. the bottom of the pants are a little bunched because of my height, but you cannot even tell, looks like that is how they are supposed to be. overall it was a great purchase considering that this pants are normally close to $70 at express I got them for less than 1/2 of that price.
B0083SWHL6|5|I have never bought a pair of these jeans before but decided to purchase based on reviews on Amazon.  I love them and they are a perfect fit!
B00ENLQ5R4|5|We love this hat! Our son was so surprised when he opened up the box. He said he will never take it off except to wear his cub scout hat! Thanks
B00NX37XNS|5|Beautiful design.
B004XVVR5O|5|Warm and wonderful! This little hat came just in time for cold weather. The chin strap is a bit distracting to my little one who thinks it is time to eat anytime something touches his cheek but other than that we love it!
B00E64MGYY|2|These are for men right? Where's the fly hole? Learning this at 3am in the dark in the bathroom while trying not to piss myself is a bad time.
B0052BQQY6|3|i bought the same 527 same size 30*32 with  2 different colors...all were ok and size was fit exactly, but this color only the fume was coming smaller than the usual and i do not know why, but it is ok :)
B005V28QBC|5|I ordered this shirt for my 5 year old son and he loves it. He is a huge Adventure Time fan. The shirt is a nice quality. He is small for his age and I ordered a size small and it is a little big on him.
B008L57S6U|5|I ordered two pairs and they both are great and very comfy. I would order more next time for sure
B005I33OZ2|5|Amazing gloves for winter
B003R6WELM|3|The arms are too long and the middle was tight - not the best fit!!!
B00PZ37PSW|5|Awesome
B006M3QUFS|4|beautiful but small little bit. but i like it for my 5 month daughter.
B00JKE2XI4|3|The company name is misleading.  This is NOT terry.  I ordered Large instead of medium to make sure it fit.  It fits with room to spare, so I could have opted for Medium.  It's &#34;bushy&#34;.  Poofy.  Expanded more than you might expect.  But, it's new.  I'm not sure what repeated washing will do.<br /><br />It's soft.  Fleece-y soft.  It's warm.  But it's also a static-inducing monster.  Nice for a cold night when you need something to throw on.  The sleeves are too big and tend to drag into everything.  The length is not full, as the picture shows.  But I'm short (5'4&#34;) and it still doesn't cover my legs.<br /><br />I am an HSP.  So, extremely sensitive to things.  Yes, it's soft and nice to feel against your skin...when it's not making static.  But I think I'd prefer to stick to cotton in my night garments.  Comfort and less static.  Still, if you like fleece and don't mind the static...
B00GMJ6C78|5|Like these very much.
B00D362FRY|5|This is my second set and yes it fits great, wears good and is patriotic. I wear these inside, but have no problem going outside to get the mail! These shorts do loose color FAST in hot water washes so be aware of that when they fade! The last set lasted four years washing heavily and used everyday.
B00JQGIZ4W|5|i;m 5'10 and the medium size fitted just as i expect it
B008H6X07E|3|It did fit correctly.<br />I returned it because I did not like the material. Its too clingly. And it clings to much on my saddle bags making them more obvious especially since the fadings on that part of the jean look like arrows pointing at it.<br />Its just for another body type.
B00DZX63GY|5|Bought this as a gag gift for Christmas, and was not disappointed.<br />It's soft, it's warm, and the craftmanship matches the price that I paid. It conveniently has little thumb holes and anyone in my house (4'10&#34;-6'2&#34;) is able to put this on.<br /><br />It has an added function of making door-to-door solicitors really uncomfortable when you answer the door in this.
B00PFOVP6Y|4|As my title says, it's sexy and sophisticated cocktail dress. Very versatile.<br /><br />It shows off figure<br />Fabric is perfect. Not clingy, but hugs the body. Thickness is great as well. I feel comfortable in that it accentuates what is needed and hides what shouldn't be on display.<br /><br />Length is perfect and doesnt ride up<br /><br />I love the low back which doesn't show off my bra<br /><br />It's tailored well<br /><br />Color is nice too<br /><br />Very elegant!
B007NLX6EG|5|This dress is even more beautiful then pictured , after reading the other reviews I did order a size up and it was a perfect fit .
B007H52GKI|5|Battling with weight is an issue for everyone, and I had some lovely and expensive bras that were not fitting quite right. These worked very well to give me just that tiny bit more space I needed. And now, actually, I've lost the weight and don't need them anymore at all, so I've passed them along to a friend who just had a baby so that she can adapt some of her bras while she is enlarged from breastfeeding.
B00JXIU12C|4|Small size but cute
B005444L4I|5|Carhartt does not disapoint.  Money well spent.  Great fit, good and quality.  I have purchased Carhartt for  years and they always are true to size and seem to out last the other name brands.
B001CIXMUO|1|The very first time i put these jeans on the button snapped right off. very cheap and poorly made. defiantly going to reconsider buying south pole from now on.
B0009JE7DI|5|I ordered these as well as the Gerber brand of onesies.. and the couple dollars difference is absolutely an amazing difference in quality. These are very very soft, thick and true to size.. the gerber ones are very thin and the quality isn't half of what these are. I will buy SpaSilk again and again if I can expect this type of quality.    Did I mention how soft they are? ;)
B00654MKWG|1|Although it is a very nice looking belt, the quality of the material is really poor, the belt is too thick in depth and mine actually had that little hoop, that holds the extra, easily torned apart of the belt at the second time I wore it.
B00HE4PUPU|4|i got the &#34;29.5in&#34; size and this fit almost perfect, my bra size is a 34A. its a little tight at the bottom but not uncomfortable. really good product!
B004HGVRKK|5|Made my husbands eyes pop out which is exactly my intention. Sexy enough to make a good night great... but still modest enough i can wear it out...
B00GD2SHJ0|5|I bought this for my six month old and it is a little big, but still adorable. I just fold the bottom part and it fits great. He will be able to wear this for at least two winters. :)
B007PMC3XI|5|Love the dress. The fit and price were perfect.  Wore it at my baby's christening. Everyone commented on how nice I looked.
B0058G8E90|3|exactly what I expected.
B00BBTWZ7A|4|Fits pretty well, not accommodating for a cloth diaper rump, but will get good use.  The material is very soft and the fasteners are better on this romper than on some of the other rompers from the same company.
B00BB0TLEO|5|good product got here fast love it
B00K6MFUY8|5|Fit very nice. Seems well made. Very comfortable.
B003OS3DI6|3|I really haven't worn it yet.  I bought it for swimming in warm water to guard against sunburn.  It seems to fit OK and we'll see how well it protects
B00DH18NPI|2|was way to small for the size of XL not a true fit
B00I8MWXN4|5|my husband bought this as a surprise (bowchickabowwow!) and it's actually much softer than i thought it would be. very comfortable and seems well made.
B00HHIA5XA|5|awesome
B003DCZ58E|2|I was very excited to receive this package only tofind out they look ccompletely FAKE! You can see the padded circle on the sides and I ordered a Medium, that's whst I wear and it is a little bit to tight, but tolerable. So I tried them on with jeans since with yoga pants or leggings and dresses it looks terrible. With jeans it doesn't, I think the thicker fabric and back pockets help blend the pads in. I didn't bother returning since my husband said that with jesns they look fine. But I'll definitely will be looking for different ones..
B00NTP0OF4|4|Cute hat; perfect for winter, somewhat on the large side for an average woman size head.
B00JLEJI2W|4|The wig is fine as is. There is no black into red gradient, rather the red panels of hair are just hidden under the black which works. Personally I took a black sharpie marker to the roots of the red to achieve that nice gradient. If you go that route absolutely wear gloves, put plastic wrap on your wig head and do your coloring in a well ventilated area. Overall I'm very happy with the wig. The distinctive shape of the hair is there which is what I was hoping for. Highly recommended, and you can't beat the price. Also make sure you brush the long side somewhat frequently when you wear it. It does occasionally tangle.
B008X1FTI6|1|I really did not like this garmet at all. It is very low quality and not at all what is pictured. I think I won't order clothes on-line anymore.
B00H3A9KG0|5|cute
B00NQ74R30|3|its to big
B00GB1N8BA|5|Perfect fit
B00IPXW14C|4|I really like it,  it's pretty nice and cheap. I will surely recommend it!<br />See ya soon! :) . .
B003556K60|5|Christmas gift,  granddaughter loves it
B00AAIZ8OK|5|I love this Firefly T-shirt. Quick delivery, good fit, and decent quality.  I've been a Firefly fan since the beginning, but didn't realize there were so many other &#34;Browncoats&#34; out there - I get comments every time I wear this shirt.
B005WSWHDS|3|Nice fit but I ordered brown and it faded after one wash!
B00JZXI8PW|5|I love a good Chaser tee and this is great!  Soft material and very cool cut with side openings.  I get compliments in it when I wear it.
B00N4DOKCE|5|This shirt was just what we expected and a lot cheaper than at the concert .
B008AQDO7C|5|Great fit and excellent quality.
B006HFJA12|5|I LOVE SwissGear! I have purchase one for our laptop. I ended up this and another one for my kids to use as<br />backpacks for school! Very well made, hold up nicely.
B00IY8DHLO|5|My wife loves them
B00VFZKLWQ|5|This was perfect for a 1920's theme outfit!!
B00Q4JN6JS|3|Was a minor tear that we had to have repaired
B0049HQ0L8|5|Very comfortable pair of socks. They keep my feet warm without feeling tight. However, they don't stay up so I wouldn't recommend them for going out unless you wear them over a pair of plain white socks.<br /><br />I got these socks because like my hands, my feet stay cold all year round due to health issues. They are wonderful to wear to bed because they are warm but not tight so they let air pass through. My feet don't feel constricted as they do when I layer multiple plain white socks. They are so soft and airy that I don't even feel that I have them on. I wear men's size 10 shoes.<br /><br />Again, they are very warm and airy and that makes them very comfortable.
B00WAI7YV8|4|Very comfortable and stretchy white Capri jeans. Perfect for summer.
B00BZSE2BO|4|I usually buy Australian size 14 however, I think maybe I it would need to be size 23 US, as it was a little big.
B00639N5W2|5|just as exspected
B00JFCYHW6|1|These pants are pretty much see-through.  They are not appropriate for yoga, or any activity outside the house, even checking the mailbox, unless accompanied by a shirt that comes down to the knees. I can see my underwear in PERFECT DETAIL.  If I wanted everyone to see my underwear, I simply wouldn't wear pants.
B003WBKWL6|4|I like Bali Skimp Skamp Brief very much.  But 6 is too large.  Please exchange it to size 5.  Thanks!
B00NGKSW60|5|Gorgeous never wanna take it off
B000P1661G|1|I've had many prada bags and I could tell this one was fake--no doubt about it. The imprint on the inner tag was lop-sided and definitely not leather. I could go on....Plus, I returned it and have proof it was received, yet I still haven't received credit for it.
B0023ZSERQ|5|I bought two using the information provided for sizing.  When they got here, I ordered two more and am thinking about getting two more. You can't beat the price.  These are the BEST fitting bras I have ever owned in my 70 years.  Previously I have hated wearing a bra.  As Maxine says the best bra is a sweatshirt.
B0058YQ3YK|1|Size does not match
B008X25XRM|4|this is a great work shirt for the younger crowd.  it fits well and it is soft and comfortable. it fits as it should in junior sizing. if you are wearing ladies sizes then go a size up. however, when I washed it, it shrunk a bit. I think I am no longer going to throw it in the drier. I think I am going to let it hang dry so it doesn't shrink. but overall, it is definitely a great buy for the price!
B005F75XK0|4|These socks are good for the price, long enough and with elastic band not to fall down. If they had rubber band at the bottom they would have been perfect.
B00LUKYDA2|4|However your little girl with want to wear a cardigan as the sequins rub against the arms and it does not feel the greatest
B00LTG8AH4|5|Kind of funny but my wife isn't a big fan. Haha
B00J9A9R7E|3|Somewhat small in the important area and the tiny holes in the fabric were uncomfortable at times.
B007PTL5SK|1|Terrible fabric (and yes I have had other seersucker suits).  The fit is awful.  Don't think I'll even be able to get this tailored to fit correctly.  The suit screams cheap.  Will regret this purchase and that I returned it one day late so have to keep it.
B00559QQXQ|4|My hubby likes it
B00G5JH5Y4|4|Beautiful top! Lots of bling!
B00GGR60IC|5|They're comfy and warm.
B002HQ7CJW|5|Nice costume! Brought it for a 5th grader.
B00JK54HEQ|5|Great cap, shaped well, fits well, looks great.
B00AK3HLP4|5|I love them and I am upset with myself that I did not get the mint ones.  PLEASE re-order them!!!
B00G3UZ6F0|5|Adorable not heavy perfect summer dress
B004R1LK7A|3|The size was too small, so I returned it for a larger one.  Very comfortable shirt for exercising.  Light weight, and breathes.
B004H6XXI4|5|Love it and it is a great fit. Streamline and the material is plush for scrubs.
B00447JA74|3|The costume was cute and pretty good quality.  I understand that it is a Halloween costume, and female costumes tend to be short and tight... But this costume didn't even cover my butt, like at all.  I ended up sewing sparkly fabric to the bottom
B00GY4V3JI|4|And have had many compliments on it. :-)
B00LRIEQTA|5|I have a isthmic back condition and some fractures on my vertebrae and I initially bought this corset for waist training which works very well but It has done wonders in relieving my back pain, this is amazing how much it helps my back pain, the only thing about it was that the size chart was a little confusing ,
B00J2RQ9IO|4|the top fit great, the bottoms were a little smaller than I expected. but love it, great quality especially for price
B00CB3JJY2|1|Very excited to have receive the coin pouch.  Pouch in great condition... however, order did not come complete.. only came with the pouch. Did NOT come with the chain or logo pendant as advertised.  Very disappointed.
B007BLNJ1I|4|Decent quality for the price, a bit sheer.
B008RKPNDO|4|Nice belt.  Should last a long time.
B00HRMZ4NW|5|This dress fits like a dream!(true to size) I love the material!!! Great Price!
B000MOMTKS|5|The dress was just georgous and a great buy.  My only disappointment was when the dress is caught in the sun the clear sequins are very pink looking.  I enquired about this before buying and was assured the crystals were clear which they are they just show a pink with exposure to sunlight.  But the communication and the dress are georgous.  Thank you
B0028S5XY0|5|I have a long torso for my height and I have never had a belly band reach comfortably over my belly... until now. I can pull these babies all the way up to the bottom of my bra (which is where my belly starts, welcome to the ninth month ladies).<br /><br />Pre-pregnancy I was 5'6\\" and 120 lbs, now in the ninth month I'm 162 lbs. I purchased size C and they feel great! I wish I had found these earlier on in my pregnancy. I suffered through a lot of footless tights that exacerbate swollen feet and compression tights that are too snug on the belly.<br /><br />The black color is a little shiny and semi-opaque (I can see a little color from my legs; these are not to be confused with leggings or pants, ugh despite the fashion these days).
B009D8GKMW|4|i like it
B0009MZXJ2|5|The Thorlos are the best socks for tennis. I tried many other brands hoping to get something less expensive ,but i keep coming back to Thorlo for their quality.
B00B55LIZK|5|Love the socks! When I opened these I was worried about how thin they were but after washing and wearing, I have to say that love them! I have long legs and these come to just below my knees. They are thin, but they are still comfortable and warm. They do seem to make my feet sweat a bit more than normal but not enough for me to consider it to be an issue. I will definitely consider buying these again when I need more!
B004TTOQDK|5|You can create so many looks for matching a headband for every outfit! and the flowers are removable so you can wear them by themselves. So many looks for such a small price! I got these for my 4 month old niece and she looks adorable !
B00IJOB0FS|5|Awesome add to my Viking t-shirt collection
B00920BYFE|4|This dress was dragging on the ground and quite large on my flower girl. Other than that it was beautiful.
B008XPFOU0|5|Loved the color. Fit well, very comfortable! Can't wait for another occassion to wear again. Dress that can be worn for many occassions.
B008XBJDJM|5|It is a beautiful coat.  My only regret is that it is brown instead of black, which I really wanted.  I know I'll be happy with this one.
B0066CUIGW|5|My son watched this show on comedy central.  I ordered the shirt for him.  true to size, fun for all
B000N9B0IY|5|Great swimsuit. Very well made.
B00UKW5HOM|5|My baby is so happy
B00V3ZBI9S|5|Great!
B003IYYE8E|4|This is a great tank for mamas whose cup size overfloweth the normal stretchy nursing tanks.  I got several of the tanks with \\"built in bra\\", and I'm sorry but if you're a DD or more, they are not enough support for going out in public.  These tanks are SO nice for using with a fully supportive nursing bra.<br />It's hard to stomach the price considering they're such a small piece of material, but I have a few and wear them every single day to work, under blouses, cardigans, etc.<br />The reason I went 4 stars instead of 5 is that the little metal tabs that hook to the nursing bra are easily breakable.  I have already had 2 of them break off after just a few washings. Be sure to follow the care instructions and lay them flat to dry so that the metal pieces don't get soft & break even more easily.
B00IZJZJG8|3|This is a very pretty dress but the quality is not great.  There were several threads hanging from the hem and seams, including some that were very noticeable inside the sheer overlay on the back of the dress.  Because they were inside the overlay material, there was no way to remove them so I returned the dress.
B00NJ2BIMU|1|Very Poor stitching and fit.
B00LEV17AQ|5|The wife loved it.
B00PS40H56|5|Beautiful dress. My granddaughter loves it. The quality is excellent. A real bargain at the price point I paid.
B00LGEBTMM|2|The material was very shiny and thin. Looks like a halloween consume. I would not recommend it. Also runs big.
B000P8G1Z0|2|I found that the actual product did not look like the image shown. It's not really \\"green floral\\".  There's a tinge of mint green, but it's mostly gold, red and yellow.  I'm sure it works fine, but didn't look like I expected it to.
B00O29RPJ4|5|Love them! Will def be ordering another pair! High waisted, perfect for lifting!
B00H9ZJMXK|5|It was packed so lovely with the pins to hold the each parts. and the qualitiyof a product is really amazing feels so good~~~ and i really like how they made a little pin on the sleeve that you close your sleeve end with.<br />About the size is that my size is M so i ordered 15-15 1/2 34-35 which is the smallest, it fits perfect!!!
B00BOUMK26|3|The size is wrong!!!<br />I am normally size 6/8 and it didn't fit at all.
B0027E4SLE|1|This \\"scarf\\" is not hemmed.  It is simply a piece of cloth cut from a bolt.  It is smaller than advertised and curls since it is not hemmed.  It is not a scarf.  Customer service told me to \\"grow up.\\"
B004NRDVO8|5|Great bra.  Love the entire Freya line.
B000OPDNDW|5|Just what I ordered, sent on time.
B00606NDCK|4|I thought by the description that this jacket would be a slightly heavier weight and a little warmer when worn...the sizing is good and non restrictive
B00E01QZOU|5|Great
B00KUFT0QA|5|GREAT VALUE VERY POSH
B00P0DPYNA|5|It's the best one love it
3979050432|4|Uncomfortable
B000P8ZNKY|5|I got this for my dad for Christmas and he likes it very much. He especially likes that he can use it as a keychain or tie it to the bike, whichever he prefers. It's good quality, good weight, and looks beautiful. It's probably the best quality one I've found so far on here for a reasonable price. I think the intentions of giving this gift say a lot and it really meant a lot to my dad to receive it. I definitely recommend it for any riders in your life to let you know you're thinking of them and praying for their safety.
B00KG0EUKU|2|I liked my footed P.J.'s but they were a bit tighter than I would have liked and the footed part is really big.
B005L89IB8|5|this belt is beautiful and i love the idea that i can put different buckles with it and it arrived very fast and not damanaged
B00BCK0VVK|4|I was unsure about it at first because of the collar.  I didn't want to look costumey, as I bought it for every day wear.  After wearing it out, I now love this dress, and I've received many compliments when I wear it.  I got the 4X and the dress fits very comfortably until you put the belt on.  I don't know what these guys are thinking, but the holes for the belt make the dress painfully uncomfortable.  It just doesn't fit the size of the dress.  I chucked it and got a wide red belt to go with it instead, which I think breaks up the dress nicely.  Another downside to the dress is that the zipper is shoddy.  On two separate occasions the zipper started to undo from the bottom.  It's not a permanent problem, you just have to unzip and rezip, but it certainly can cause embarrassment.
B00C7BNVKQ|5|Bought this for my daughter,  a little big but very comfortable! Hoodies are supposed to be bigger! She loves it!
B00KS6N5PI|3|Bought as a gift for my sister. When she tried it on the first time, it was a perfect fit. The bottoms ended just below her ankles, the waistband was just below her natural waist, the top was snug but fit well. With every wash it shrinks, particularly the bottoms. Currently the bottoms end mid calf, the waistband is hipster height and the top looks like a child size. She refuses to hang dry the pajamas and uses the dryer, but none of her other pajamas shrink like this. This was a Christmas present that she's really liked so she has worn and washed them several times, but even she conceded that now they've shrink so much they're becoming uncomfortable. She's 5'6&#34;, so a more petite lady who hang dries may have better luck. Shrinkage has been the only issue. They haven't faded or had any sewing issues.
B00NTQZF5W|5|excellent
B003SGWYNO|5|I went to the Alpha Industries site before purchasing on Amazon and they said to order one size up.  Definitely order a size up from your regular size because these are very slim fitting jackets.<br /><br />Otherwise, my husband absolutely loves this jacket.  Great quality!!!
B0071AXL8K|3|This belt has a papery feel.  The &#34;leather&#34; doesn't feel like leather at all.  The only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because it looks good on.  This is not a durable everyday belt though so beware...
B000GEGKLI|5|I used these while teaching a unit on bats.  Fabulous item.
B0081OUCRS|2|Not full like the picture makes you think
B009JBYWLE|5|I bought this shawl for New-York streets. This shawl fits perfectly for my any outfit. It is soft, warm, colorful and  weightless. I love it! Given unique design, I got tons of compliments!
B00PUD83RO|5|Very good quality and style.
B003U90WXI|2|I ordered this shirt in a large size. When I received the shirt, the sticker on the bag it came in said large, but the shirt inside was an XL. I didn't have tome to return it before Christmas so I wrapped it up, bag and all, to give to my husband with the intention of letting him see what he was getting and dealing with the size issue after the holiday. In the chaos, he ripped open the clear bag before I could tell him not to, so now we have a shirt that is the wrong size.
B00LVSAAL4|5|Great product!
B00HS48E8Q|4|Cute, cute, cute!  But very thin material and don't know how it will stand up to a busy toddler boy.
B003H145KA|4|I like the soft cotton blended with lycra, and the cut. Received 3 bright solid colors: orange, blue and fuchsia, definitely not subtle colors. The lace is actually sewn on top of the panties. I was expecting the lace to extend at the top of the panties, creating a more delicate look.
B00C04MY12|4|I've been working out and lost weight.  I currently have a 34&#34; waist, which is fine but my thighs are thick.  I have 26&#34; thighs and the underwear is a little tight in the leg. I probably should've gone with a large.  If you have bigger legs like I do, I'd go a size larger.  Pretty satisfied otherwise.
B00D4K44WS|1|You get what you pay for. The coat ripped the first time my daughter wore it and it was too late to send it back...
B000MX5WSA|5|Amazingly comfortable fit
B00IGO1OFM|4|Beautiful
B00Q4TOVJ2|5|S fit me perfect, I'm 5 foot and 90 pounds. I love the neoprene
B00DNV9298|3|I like the material, its soft and forgiving. You need to wear a strapless bra, no bra or racer back bra depending on the style you adjust it to.  Would be good for smaller chested people as it doesn't show cleavage much and draws the eye up to the neck and shoulders. The packaging shows 4 ways to wear it, but only three look good (all involve crossing the top &#34;strap&#34; sleeves. I would probably buy it again but should be price $5-7 less in my opinion.
B00ED7H8CO|5|Fits well and went and ordered another one.
B00KSCS20A|5|Very nice fit.  I am happy with my purchase.
B00KJBU07S|5|It IS somewhat small for a t-shirt but not for a compression shirt, which is what it actually is. I have 4 that I use exclusively while lifting and I love them.
B00FML3LSU|4|these are very nicly constructed and fit very well the color is a brillant pink this is my first jock strap that i have order or even owned i beleive i will order more
B0002TOZ0A|5|I loved this.. it was a great way to wear black dress shoes (yes the shoes are a little to big - so there is room) and dress pants.. I bought them just to take on vacation and it is a bit cold in Europe at this time.. so I could use them for a nice night out.. no one was really looking at them.. and then just throw them away when i was done... or leave them at the hotel to lighten my suitcase... and I loved that they actually went over my calf.. unlike the white ones I bought.. and stayed up.
B004OVELQU|5|I'm delighted that reasonably priced Haggar slacks are available via Amazon.  I tired of continual price increases by a competitor from Maine whose clothes I liked.  I also tired of their coupon policy.  I prefer no coupons and a reasonable price for value.
B005FOE7FA|5|wasnt to sure about the dress at first because it was so cheap but was nicely surprised when it came ,the size was pefect and it looked awsome on, we did get another dress but this one was the clear choice
B00BSOQ5VU|4|I love it so much but it was too big so I'm having it tailored. Sometimes I'm L and other times M with BCBG. I guess this time I should have chosen M
B007D34E9A|5|it is good.
B00H1ORZLK|5|Darn right adorable
B00CEM3ZQS|5|I like the way lower rise jeans look , but they tend to ride down.  This belt solves the problem.
B004LQ168E|5|I purchased the Stephen Joseph umbrella in the owl design after purchasing the matching rainjacket and rainboots.  The entire ensemble is just too darn cute!  What I  had not noticed about the umbrella but was pleasantly surprised to discover is that there are rubber 'tips' on the umbrella spines (?) so as to prevent any serious eye injury from inadvertently poking oneself in the eye.  The umbrella 'glides' open smoothly and easily, and our three year old granddaughter has no problem in operating it. The umbrella alone is a great purchase, but the entire ensemble is to die for.  I love shopping Amazon.com and leaving feedback, hoping that my comments will be found useful by other shoppers.  I depend on the feedback on this site before making many purchases, and believe that leaving honest feedback about a product is a responsibility not to be taken lightly.
B00WQCA7YY|5|Extremely light weight which is perfect in the Hot and Humid weather of the South. The material is not see through.  May be long on person under roughly 5'8&#34;.  I got for my daughter and she absolutely LOVES it.
B00Q2LG7EY|1|This dress was too fitted and short, the material is extremely thin. I believe my size was a medium. If you do end up purchasing it get it in black
B00JCJL0MC|2|thread used is not elastic, so if like me you have a big butt and small waist, you need it to fit over your butt and then still be tight on your waist. It's tight on my butt and loose on my waist. cheap fabric too.
B00DC4T0CA|5|This was a gift and my nephew loves it!
B000VCO9IQ|5|I recently got this shirt, it looks cool if your into that sorta thing. Good quality. The only I thing is that sizes vary from shirt to shirt. One medium shirt can fit you nicely while another different medium shirt can fit you a little loose, the sizes listed here on AMAZON are not specific. You can always call and ask for sizing info (youth sizes, adult sizes)....BUT  Everything gets delivered, no delays. This seller is reliable, they won't cheat you out of your money. I've ordered from them sometimes before and its always been SAFE!!
B0002TOTL0|2|Very very hard to put on, will not buy more of this sock.
B00NW6VAW6|5|Fits perfectly and ideal for this type of warm weather.  I washes beautifully.  I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to others.
B00MA6SY64|5|I love this top.  It fits just like the photo!  I get compliments every time I wear it.  When I get a chance I will upload a photo.
B0030A726W|5|We purchased 7 of these sets, 4 of the blue (one in extra long), one in green, one in red, and one in ivory for the groomsmen, best man, father of the groom and groom, respectively, in our wedding. We couldn't be happier with the quality and the price. The colors pop much more in person than in the picture, and the quality is just as good as a tie you'll find for $100 or more at a department store. The matching pocket square and cufflinks were a perfect match to the tie, and a nice added detail to our guys' tuxes.
B00HSMQSIG|5|good quality, great price.
B004J2F6CM|5|I was impressed with this item.  It is very cute and quality is just fine.  Worth every penny for this low price! I needed this for a party and it worked out wonderfully.
B006ZAO5C8|5|I am a home health nurse and wanted a cooler lab coat than my long sleeved one in these hot summer months. This one is very attractive and seems well made. The pockets are roomy for my pens, scissors and alcohol wipes. I'm glad I got it, even though initially I was looking for a less expensive and more basic style. Hopefully, this one will last me a long time.
B004K3VUKW|4|I loved the costume I just found it to be a bit tight around the arms
B00FHMA04W|4|It is ok. did not fit me.
B00HV3DJ16|5|Love this shirt. Although my wife says it makes me look a bit older. The quality is above par.
B005Y16YDM|5|We used this outfit for a baby blessing. He was a little over 11 lbs at the time when we used it and it fit perfectly. Very cute. Bright white not off white like pictured.
B005CSOF9M|4|The size was what I expected, however the color was a little more darker and it wasn't as soft as I though it will be
B00RN0MPGC|5|The shorts fit well and look nice. The price was great.
B00AWB49B8|2|Bought the 34DD as well, but it was too small. This cup is perfect,but fit around is too big.
B004O6YVCE|2|Not made for flat nipple woman. (usually older ones) Have to be pointy to get the adhesive strips to work...Also really  no  directions on  the tape, I figured it  out  but  some people may  not.
B00O7RAPMK|5|Beyond adorable.
B004REATTM|1|Horrible, looks like a girls sweater and fits oddly.
B00AQ4FU9G|5|All leather not laminated just what I wanted
B004V2NWW6|5|I put these Kushie bibs on my baby registry, but instead of waiting to receive them as a gift, I purchased them myself because the stock was getting lower each day! I absolutely loved them whan I received them! They are definitely newborn size (they fit nicely underneath the neck, have velcro closures, and aren't so big that you have to search to find baby underneath!), which was perfect since, at that age, all you're trying to do is catch any milk dribbles (unlike older babies, especially when they begin to drool and begin baby food). The designs of these bibs are so cute and modern, with little saying such as \\"It's my Earth, too\\", etc. I purchased these bibs in different colors (White, Mocha, Sky Blue, etc) and I received plenty of compliments on them once my baby boy was here and wearing them. These bibs do not have a plastic-lined back (necessary for older, drool-y babies), but a lined back really isn't necessary for newborns. These were definitely worth purchasing! And the price was great, too. I plan to keep a couple in my son's \\"memory\\" box...
B00HWQNI2W|5|This tank top is perfect for the summer. The fabric is light and see-through, so I recommend wearing a black bra or white bra depending on which color you choose. I usually wear a US size Medium and the 8/10 size fits me perfectly. The top is super cute and I'm so happy to have purchased this item.
B00AOK1I5M|4|Nice, but does run small.
B00IDFTLY0|4|The product is good<br />It's is pretty but the size is such 6 months, not 9 months+<br />I don't found size bigger
B00IJIMOVS|5|These pants are slick. And i mean both a nice pair of pants, and the fact that they are waterproof. The inner thigh vents are great, love the orange color. Pumpkin is a perfect way to describe it. The rubber elastic at the end of each pant leg that holds on to your boots is wonderful. And you have enough space for additonal layers if needed. Overall a solid product.
B0053HVJN2|4|I bought these as a gift, but I have yet to hear how well they were received. I liked how they looked.
B00DW5JVG4|1|the shirt breaked off after the first washing in washing machine. that's why only one star. money were wasted for nothing
B008P33Y5M|1|The skirt part was SO short (and I'm 5'1), I thought I could make it work with tights, but even then, the torso part is sooooo long. I tried to use a belt, but then the top part was so puffy and was just frumpy looking, so I pulled it down around my hips... and then the elastic part kept shifting and showing, and I eventually ended up donating this item. The print is super cute, it's just poorly executed. They have other super cute dresses I'd recommend over this one.
B00IAS8KHY|2|Runs really small in the arms. The material on the arms is thin and you have to wear tank tops or you'll  see the shirt almost completely. Its OK for the price but I probably won't buy another.
B006E0Y65U|3|Too small...
B00076XR66|5|I loved this dress because it is pictured as white with the blue flowers.  It is a very nice dress, but it is blue instead of white as it is pictured, just wanted everyone to know.
B00GV2G5PU|5|There shorts were exactly what I was looking to buy. Satisfied for the value buy, here.
B00C8GBZJY|5|These are cool!  They feel comfortable and even a bit supportive.  I like the anti-slip grips on the palms.  I'm looking forward to trying them out on bike rides and during plein air painting sessions.
B00F2YN7T0|5|Super cute! Fits really well, and holds up to a lot of washing! Shipped fast!! Lots of compliments!! Will order again
B007SRZOFY|5|Great pair of jeans...I have a big booty and it's hard to find jeans that are flattering and comfy.
B002SDE0PS|4|This was a perfect costume for our son who loves Curious George. He was able to wear it two years in a row for Halloween. The second year it was a little small but fit well enough that it didn't look bad
B001MU3KF4|4|This costume is as you expect any halloween costume to be.  I don't expect much but it did hold up through our evening of trick-or-treating.  Ours didn't have a belt that went with it.  I'm not sure if that's standard or not.  If so, the description is incorrect.  Our costume was new so there shouldn't have been any items missing.  The little velcro piece at the top back of the costume was too small to secure.
B002R0FF7O|5|Love, love, love these tights! Best tights my daughter has ever worn. Happy we stumbled across these a few years back. My daughter is an average size 11 year old and wears the s/m adult. Hoping capezio never stops making these.
B002MUADQM|5|It's a comfortable sleepwear of good quality and nice design combined, plus the shopping of clothing on Amazon is so easy with zoomable pictures of different colors and angles into fine close-up details. I really liked it.
B00KSZ2IEI|5|love it
B00CEJ2VUC|4|This is a comfortable shirt but it is form fitting so I  recommend a size up from normal.  The neckline is a little too revealing I have to move my bra straps outward so they won't show.  But it is a comfy, attractive tee.
B0029T3TUI|5|The ring looks amazing but it is a little big so not the perfect size but it still passes for when a drunk guy is hitting on you in the bar.  The keychain isn't the most secure but it works.  Just don't be surprised if you lose the ring if you haven't checked on it in a while.  This ring definitely helped me keep guys at bay when I used to go out and party with my girlfriends.
B004126QCE|4|Comfortable and fits like it should
B00GIY5322|1|Very bad print, overpriced, bad fabric's quality. If I had made it myself it would have been much better.
B00MQAV43O|5|Nice quality, arrived as described, great value for the price
B002TLUFDA|5|Good!
B002R0KHE0|5|love these jackets and was good quality..
B0085K387E|2|I had to stop wearing these and go back to underwire. My back would ache after just a few hours of wear.
B00PXAL66O|1|Too large
B00BJOTQQ0|5|Love this dress. I have it in pink, and black. It's strong, and while it -can- rip, it can also take a lot of abuse.
B0066C71KI|5|they are very  comfortable and I liked the price  is and was right after shopping around this was the best buy and well made
B009YJDZJQ|5|I expected a pretty tee shirt, not the stunner that arrived in my smiley package from Amazon! The whole front is a heavy jacquard lace in an elaborate pattern, and is much more &#34;dressy&#34; than I expected from any tee shirt. Looks incredible when wearing a suit, and is nicely lined in the same fabric. That way, I don't need to wear a camisole and there are no embarrassing &#34;holes&#34; in the shirt.<br /><br />Everyone who has seen this shirt has showered it with compliments, and when I tell them where I got it and the incredible price, they don't believe me. I love it and am strongly leaning toward getting another to wear when this one wears out (hopefully years from now).
B007O6SQYU|4|Comfortable, easy to put on.  Looks great under tank tops.  The only thing that could make it better is better coverage under the arms.
B00ET1V51Y|5|Everyone talked about the sizing and how it seemed like they ran big.  But I went ahead and ordered them in my normal size.  When I pulled them out of the package they did look a little bit big to me, but when I put them on they were perfect!  I really like the material as well.  I don't like 100% cotton panties because my outer clothing sticks to them, like when I am pulling my pants up or when I wear dress slacks and they just don't hang as well.  These are exactly what I wanted!
B009E8MXRM|5|I got this shirt in the orange color and I love it! I got a large, but the next one I order will need to be a medium. Besides from running large, I love this shirt! It's comfortable, washes well and I like the style.
B00NU6PVTQ|4|These leggings are very cute! A little disappointed they run large I'm 5'5 147 pounds an I bought a size lg an there more an XL!! If you decide to purchase these get a size smaller!! These leggings are a cotton material not spandex!!! I will be sending these back and ordering a M
B00822C452|5|The waist band is a little snug but the length is perfect
B000XJBENA|2|Not what I had expected
B00ONENC4A|5|This is my favorite bra.
B00BRDDIT4|5|Very comfortable, I love them, you can't go wrong, very affordable, for the price what more can you ask for
B00CDZUZKU|5|Good quality and attractive belt. The inside zipper is about 14 inches long. It takes a bit of work to get bills in there, but it works. Order a bigger size than your pant size.
B006ZCIQ2G|5|This is a great bag.  You can put trader pins on the &#34;leaves&#34; and there is a large pocket for all of your necessities.
B009SRQGUY|5|this was a great buy for the money - have seen them online for twice as much - same shirt!!!!!
B008VPRBLC|5|These boxers are great for sleeping and I use them as my pajamas.  I like the bold, bright colorrs and the fit is perfect for.  I am not a small guy and X-Large was just right.  I may have to get some for a full weeks worth.
B0051D7NOM|5|The pants are well made and fit perfectly.  Thanks for the fast delivery.
B00E1PAQMM|4|This Kiwi Co. vest is lightweight, easy to wear, and really great for travel--easy to pack and goes with everything.
B00CCZSXCS|1|Way too small.
B00DX00S7Y|5|My son loved these, they fit well..
B009EX2D0O|2|Unfortunately I could not wear it, top was very large and pants don't look nice :(
B00K1U3470|4|Was slightly slightly snug but fit him:). Super cute costume
B001IBHONG|3|Pretty and functional...but arrived damaged...will probably return.
B000U8GVIC|5|Knee sock texture is great.   Long enough (I have long legs and they were just the right height.   They stay up well on their own/over a pair of tights.
B00PCXI7ZU|5|Excellent product.  Very handsome in its craftsmanship.
B00GZBH290|5|Absolutely love it. Have 3 others of this same bra.  It's the only kind I'll wear now.  My size is 34B and the fit is right on.
B00UEHRHLY|5|Love it!
B00D69COY2|2|Not what I expected.  The fabric is very thin.  Definitely dont think I would be able to actually swim in it.  It fit ok, so if you only want to wear it to lay out by the pool it may be ok.
B007PT9U5A|5|Just what I was looking for.
B00SR7952W|4|Love it!
B00EB2FX0K|5|Perfect. Loved these
B00AQ93RGO|2|This belt came apart with gentle wearing, the bonded surface separated easily from the backing, poor quality.
B000FVY33E|4|It would be perfect for just the toe area. I covers toes and the ball of the foot only. I needed a sock that comes up the arch area.
B0051U1846|5|When working with a four gallon sprayer on my back these socks provided adequate room and no discomfort. Most comfortable socks I have for heavy work. Excellent fit and they are not constraining when my feet become hot and swollen.
B003P2VQ0S|5|I used to wear underwire bras - until I discovered Playtex wirefree. They are comfortable and they hold the girls up.
B00IKAJ7T2|5|Fits great, very comfortable.  Need more, but price just tripled.
B005F29AIQ|5|These are offically my favorite pair of pants for my daughter. They fit her nearly perfect. There's a bit of room left in the back for growth without falling off, which is perfect, so she'll be able to wear the pants for a couple months past 12 months. Well worth the price. I would definetly recomend this product for any 12 month old in need of a cute pair of jeans.
B00BYBZDBU|2|very uncomfortable...the fasteners dig into my sides and legs
B000G79KUI|3|too large
B000BNGN66|5|This fits my need for a slimmer wallet perfectly and the price can't be beat!
B008ZTZG1Q|5|Nice hat and good quality.
B009L38MN4|5|Los felicito, excelente el tiempo de entrega del articulo, en buenas condiciones. Los recomendare a mis amigos, familiares y conocidos
B00AZPHNO6|5|I absolutely adore this skirt!! It looks great on, the tie dye is great. My fav part is the ties. You can either leave them untied so the skirt is long, or you can tie them and it shortens the length of the skirt a few inches. I'm only 5'2\\" so most long skirts drag on the floor for me. This one is perfect!
B00LN4USZE|5|I loved the item and how it was made, but it was WAY too small.
B004BR1TVW|5|This is the first pair of jeans to fit me well.  Everything else was too low rise for me or too baggy in the legs.  These were as if tailor made for me.  I highly recommend these jeans if you want to feel good in them and look sexy!
B00CD1RCO6|5|Love it! This is the most comfortable<br />Bra I've ever worn and I've been wearing Bali 's for a long time  I've ordered 2 more.
B00IZ61MQC|3|Loved the suit, but as soon as I tried it on BOTH gramets fell out!!!  Was out of country and did not return in time.  Money lost!!!
B003G2Z784|5|For those needing a slimmer fit, order the D1 slim Dockers pants and you will not be disappointed.  Sharp looking pants.
B003WER9DC|5|Nice shirt.  The fit is true and the colors are better than the pictures.  I will buy more of these shirts.
B007C07RD4|3|hat fits good,but have a complaint ....it's the wrong color I ordered a black hat and got a navy blue.
B00EIBYLO8|3|It sticks to other fabric and pills like crazy. That being said, it is such a great deal it is hard to complain.
B00OVJVTAQ|5|Love it!
B00743P7FE|5|very comfortable  and easy  to put on and off
B0011N3H7I|4|I bought this bra in black (36 F) and I love the look and feel of the materials. It is easy to clasp and true to size. My only real complaint is the noise that the underwire makes when I move my body side to side. It rubs against the fabric and squeaks quite loudly. I have another Anita nursing bra that does the same thing. It is truly annoying, but I can live with it since this bra ticks all the boxes for fit, style and ease of use. I do reccomend this bra for women who need a larger size nursing bra that still looks attractive.
B00CONNDGO|2|I was really impressed with this waist trainer at first, but I've been wearing it for a few weeks and the latex has already ripped. I wouldn't say I got to small of a size it actually fits me pretty comfortable. I am really disappointed it ripped because of how expensive it was. Now it's loose, and really not doing anything for me! I would not recommend.
B00CBBB5KK|5|Costumes fit just as expected I am an extra small and it was true to size. The quality was good considering the price.
B00H70UWB8|1|Very disappointed, it is a women's coat, zipper is on opposite side. Also not military, waste of money unless my daughter likes it. READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASE...
B0020ML3DE|4|The ankle comes up higher than it shows in the picture.  I expected them to be just above the top of my sneaker but they're about 2-3 inches above.  They do what they're supposed to do though, so I am keeping them.
B001HD0BMG|5|The costume was exactly what I thought it was going to be. My daughter was so excited, we tried it on right when it came. We actually lost the headpiece because I let the girls play with it, but I improvised and made a new one out of fun foam. We had so much fun, Thank you!
B0006U04ZK|5|I needed to replace my cotton briefs, and opted to try these since my Skimp Skamps were pretty nice.<br /><br />They are a light, comfortable cotton brief and do very well in the hot weather we have had visiting Mexico.  Very happy with the purchase.  I have already purchased more.
B00SL3TYIW|5|Clothes have  received, color fresh and very fairy. It is a very beautiful dress, I am very satisfied, also coming next time.
B00CX2J3JC|5|Love all my purchase.  Will definitely be purchasing more.
B00M4OPUZA|3|Nice lift tucks tummy well
B00DYTEQ3Q|5|very pretty and i get what i needed
B00EZK4WRI|1|Horrible quality fabric!
B00HIKV9UA|3|Love the dress but needs to get an xxxl.  It comes small.
B007N0S76Y|5|I just got this and I think its a great little product, you can wear it as absolutely anything and it's thin enough you can wear a hat over it easily. It's exactly as advertised. I don't understand the 1 star reviews.
B00G4LCQJW|4|would have preferred no iron, but it is a good shirt and wears well
B003QMMWPA|5|These are true to size and quite long, so you can wear with tall platforms/wedges if you are average height. The denim is sturdy and comfortable. With the high waist and bootcut, they're a nice change from overdoing it on the skinny jeans!
B00A2E7YGW|5|AGRADECIDA PORQUE ES DE MATERIAL, RECOMENDADA 100%, NO HAY DUDA QUE ES LO QUE NECESITABA, Y EN PERFECTO ESTADO, VERY GOOD
B004EI1IY6|5|Nice idea. Am having face skin peel and it perfect for forbidden time in sun.  Arrived promptly.  Need t tomorrow.  Thanks
B005GXRCSE|5|It does all you said it do.. I am happy.. Fits well in my pocket, carries my address and credit cards etc.
B00OFJ3B4Y|1|Extremely too small!
B004WNGKZU|5|nice bag my daughter loved it<br />is the bag I expected<br />the product is good quality<br />is the perfect bag for use at school my daughter
B008E6IL0S|1|If your looking for something really cheap....this is it. It's NOT a mask that goes over your head. If I knew it was going to be this, I would have never bought it!
B00J7VB1RE|3|My grandson loved the pajamas but they were really tight. He's only going on 5 yrs old, only weighs 45 lbs. he needs the size 8.
B00W8Z0Y3I|4|Very nice, but they're more like panties and I wouldn't wear them outside my clothes.
B008GP0B64|5|Exactly as described and received earlier than expected.
B000A2K5DA|5|When I purchased 52 waist, the pants were too short in the back (exposing top of my behind). I had to purchase 54 waist to cover my backside but that is too large and I had to pull them tight with a belt. Other than that I loved the pants and am very impressed with the quality and touches such as leather pocked patch for clip on tools and lined pockets for durability. Also the price is not bad.
B002DNOW2O|4|Bought for a friend she loved it. Only problem was the one one clapse was crooked.
B000144RAO|5|Best fit and most comfortable
B000TA8LJ8|4|Fit and finish are very good.
B00GI1OIYE|5|Very cute! Love that this was light and almost see- thru. Perfect for work on those hot summer days!
B00498CQBA|2|This dress ran way small and it was very difficult for me to get into.  I also am 5' 10&#34; and this dress was WAY too short for me.
B0009HN7GS|5|Pretty, and very comfy, will buy more.
B0084NJXGW|3|Dockers Men's Pocket Khaki Pants.<br /><br />The fit was too tight.<br />I thought they were the same style as a previous purchase.
B000CEO8P2|5|Perfect fit, thank you.
B005CSORY0|5|Feels like great quality, and has a good look.
B00PA6RPXE|5|Love it
B006Z26A4C|5|Perfect spring/summer sleeper/romper.  Very light/thin cotton, not heating, when you want to protect either from sun, light breezes, or cooler evenings.  Size 0-3 months is roomy width ways and fits a 5kg/11lb baby comfortably. Well made, cute print. If you're looking for organic this brand is lovely, not for winter though.
B005GNOFKC|5|I forgot how comfortable a bra  feels- helps when it fits right!
B006VN9BWI|3|the dress is very nice , the right fit and the material is not so bad for the money, I would definitely purchase more dresses for my girls from this company.
B001U2XZLS|5|I love these PJ's so much I bought two pair.  They are soft and silky just as indicated.  They run pretty much true to size.  Did not shrink after machine washing or drying; but, as is typical for 100% cotton the collar and placket bunched up when dried in dryer. I choose to line dry these PJ's now because they did not get stiff as many cottons do when hung up to dry.
B0031U0P7E|5|There are cheap imitation leather belts out there but this is genuine heavy duty leather. I've noticed there is no stretching between the buckle hole. This belt will definately last for many years with lot's of abuse.
B005QEOSX0|5|Great quality plenty of space
B00KED65MU|5|I love this skirt, at first I wasn't sure about ordering it because I have ordered skirts off of Amazon in the past and was disappointed, but I took a chance with this one and I was really surprised that it actually fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend this item and I plan on ordering another one myself.
B00CL0HPUK|5|Really soft and nice. Steal for the price.
B000FE5LBO|5|Fits great, best pair of underwear I've bought in a long time.  Feels nice too and the price is reasonable.
B00DD5FTW8|4|Fits good in the front the back is a bit stretched out, so it could look a bit weird butt its not supposed to be a fitted hoodie so take this review with a grain of salt. I like it.
B0015IPE9S|5|Tough and easy to clean. It says dry clean only but  a wet rag and soap does the trick most of the time.
B00D787AZK|2|I Ordered same size as regular bra and this was too small.  Quality was good. Need to return to amazon.
B00I0QG4OW|5|Mom thinks they look great
B005C4VUJO|5|Very comfortable
B0028Y4UXO|3|I have two grandchildren going back to school, and the school requires \\"Hunter Green\\" for their uniform.  Problem is they only supply Red, White and two Blues.  No green.  I need the 4/5 and the 6/7 for them.<br />So this avenue doesn't work for me.  Hunting through Target and WalMart to get The green and also the gray the school allows.  What a disappointment.
B00B2H93QM|4|I enjoy the response my friends get when they see my geek inspired shirts. It is a lot of fun to show off my interests via my clothes. Can't wait to get more in the future.
B00C7NEU9U|5|I love the wide brim, style and the good prices on this website. I will get more colors of this hat in the future
B008MI3BR6|4|I just got these today and following the advice of previous reviews I sized up in lenght and waist.  The fit was great though slightly long but ok when i put on shoes.  I am cool once it does not drag on the ground.  My only issue with this is the distressed decorated hems.  I would have prefered finished hem that was normal.  To me (my perceptions only) it takes away from the look of the jeans which if i do say so is outstanding.
B00OBZZ8T8|4|It's much nicer in person, but it's a tad bigger than I expected but I don't think it'll be a problem since he's not part of the wedding. If it were for wedding photos I'd definitely return for a smaller size if it were possible. I saw in the question section that someone asked if it were blue or white; and I definitely have to say I thought so too by the pic on the listing but in person (and hopefully by my picture) you can see that there isn't any blue just white, grey, and yellow. The bow seems to be well made, better quality than expected; so I think I'll buy more of this brand in the future if needed.
B00PLP926C|1|Extremely disappointed. This dress looks NOTHING like the picture. Looks like an Easter egg..pale pink, light purple, tan and black. I did not see purple in the picture. Will not order from this company again. Ordered two horrible dresses :(
B00ARB56QK|3|I have not yet had a chance to wear this belt. I ordered several at one time and when they arrived the odor coming from the box was so strong I could not keep it in the house. I had to take the belts outside to air our for about 3 days before I could stand to keep them in the house. I am hoping to be able to wear them soon.
B002R5FX6C|2|I liked that the socks came in the right color, and there were no quality defects in the construction of the socks (no loose threads, no holes, etc.)    However, these socks stretch a ridiculous amount.  Meaning when you put them on the tops go almost over your knees!  Plus the heel on the sock never aligns with your heel, so you get an ugly heel bulge somewhere around your ankle.  This issue with the stretch did not go away after repeated washings.  So the color looks great, but the fit was not good.  I would not buy these again.    edit: My shoe size is 9.5 US mens, medium width.
B00KDC5P2I|4|These corsets are made in China not the US. Sizes are difficult to estimate- even though there is a size chart
B00XXC7J4M|5|This outfit is absolutely adorable! I can't wait to see our new little granddaughter in it.
B003WYF2XG|4|I little thinner material then I expected but the price was great..
B003TJJFQO|4|I ordered this item awhile back and it came so I tried it on and it fit ok. The straps on the side where it settles on your hips fit too tight so I cut them off and it still looks good. The item is really stretchy so I doubt it was going to fit since I'm 5'6&#34;-5'7&#34; and about 185 pounds with a size 15/16 dress size but it fit. I'm a 38C and it covers completely but the straps around the chest feel a bit weird. I guess i might have to adjust it a bit since it does ride up from the bottom. I bought this item from finejo and it took a couple weeks to come in and the item was as described. For a little over 3 bucks it was a great deal. Can't wait to wear it for my boyfriend.
B00B6EALDA|2|THEY DID NOT FIT TO GOOD AT THE HIP{TOO TIGHT},AND THE LEG, WAS{TOO TIGHT}.
B00FDLSRDS|5|The baseball top is attractive and the fabric is very soft and comfortable.<br />A very nice casual top addition to a daily wardrobe.
B00BXPP3EO|5|So cute! She wouldn't take it off the first day she tried it on!
B00ZEHF03Q|1|I had to send it back so my suggestion is that you get a size 2 sizes BIGGER than you need
B0085BTA6G|1|The item was defected when I received, it is not a ONE SIZE that fits all. it fits really bad on the legs.  I have no way of contacting seller . I have pictures showing this. In my orders it says item was delivered on Saturday 26 when in reality was delivers Monday 28th afternoon
B000WO1FAS|5|Perfect!
B002ABHTFQ|3|good product but pants needs more pockets side pockets would be wonderful that is the only reason i probably won't buy again
B00BZ62C5Y|5|After reading reviews I was somewhat skeptical about how I would look, as compared to the professional model.  This costume is the best one I've purchased yet.  I bought a medicum (I'm 5'6&#34; and 125 lbs,) and glad I did. The only con I can see is the foam makes the suit feel hot.  Other thant hat it's great.
B00PTL5P64|1|Material is horrible over all hate the dress<br />Nothing like the picture
B0009GDUK2|4|These fit wife a little tight I thought. but she said she liked them.  Very sexy and seem made very well.
B000UZ7Q70|5|great value billfold made from real leather with them over supply of pockets and storage areas larger wallet spreads out all the other documents
B001GOUDBU|3|Judging by the physical sizes of the pants, there is no quality control/assurance.  I recently ordered six \\"pairs\\" (all of them white, size medium), and none of them are the same physical size:    Medium pair 1:  Waist = 27.5\\", Rise = 14\\", Inseam = 27\\"  Medium pair 2:  Waist = 27.5\\", Rise = 14\\", Inseam = 26\\"  Medium pair 3:  Waist = 30\\", Rise = 15\\", Inseam = 28-29\\" (one leg 28\\", one leg 29\\")  Medium pair 4:  Waist = 27\\", Rise = 14\\", Inseam = 27\\"  Medium pair 5:  Waist = 28\\", Rise = 14\\", Inseam = 28-29\\" (one leg 28\\", one leg 29\\")  Medium pair 6:  Waist = 28\\", Rise = 15\\", Inseam = 28-29\\" (one leg 28\\", one leg 29\\")    Last year, I ordered four \\"pairs\\" (white, size small), and those physical sizes are:    Small pair 1:  Waist = 25.5\\", Rise = 12\\", Inseam = 22.75\\"  Small pair 2:  Waist = 25\\", Rise = 12\\", Inseam = 23-23.5\\" (one leg 23\\", one leg 23.5\\")  Small pair 3:  Waist = 25\\", Rise = 12\\", Inseam = 23-23.5\\" (one leg 23\\", one leg 23.5\\")  Small pair 4:  Waist = 25\\", Rise = 12\\", Inseam = 23.5-24.5\\" (one leg 23.5\\", one leg 24.5\\")    Regarding the physical comfort, I find these to be very comfortable.  In my opinion, the fleece lining makes a big difference (I find regular, non-fleece-lined thermals uncomfortable).  Regarding warmth, these do make a big difference to me (however, they are thin, so don't set your expectations too high).    Lastly, you should note that the medium size is not suitable for people who are shorter than average.  I'm 5'7\\", and these mediums are way too long for me.  The waist sits about 3\\" above my navel, and the bottom hems are either bunched up at my ankles or I'm literally walking on them because they're too long.
B00KIHQU2M|5|love it!! good quality and fits perfectly very comfortable!
B00GUDGEVU|5|Great value! This apron works perfectly for me in the back room of the frame shop. I'm tall and was a bit concerned that the length may not be adequate but it turns out to be a great fit.
B008KCKAVO|4|I bought this product during the thanks giving lighting deal and even with that deal and price I feel the product was little expensive for the quality I was getting. the size and fit was a little tight at the shoulders and neck. The product as such looks really good and the stiching and making is wonderful.
B005CWU1RI|5|Very fast shipping
B005KOOKDO|3|I like the fit and the look of the lantern sleeves on this sweater. It is a little sheer, but I am fine wearing a tank underneath it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the whole front of the sweater pilled immediately... starting after the first time I wore it. Black is a forgiving color and it's probably not as noticeable from a distance, but over time it's gotten even worse. To the point where after 2 months of use, I doubt I will continue to wear it much longer. if you want is as a basic in your maternity wardrobe, keep looking. If you will only wear occasionally, it's a nice looking option.
B006HFBUPQ|4|Love this jacket. Had to send it back once to get a larger size though. The sizes run a little small due too the lining in them.
B001PU9A9Q|5|Best alternative to a bra ever! They do exactly what they advertise, and they last at least six months. They are super easy to clean and manage to adhere perfectly. They are virtually invisible with almost all clothing. They cover exactly what they need to. I don't know how I survived without them.
B0043WF1LY|5|This costume is better in person than in the picture. Its very grandiose like a very very powerful sorcerer. Its a full robe you can wear by itself then another vestment piece that you can wear over the robe. Very high quality design. Definitely worth the great price.
B00SSEMZFI|4|A little too slim for me compared to other Calvin Klein pants I own.
B00LAGY7H0|5|I love these pants.  They are a little long so I need to hem them.  Other than that they are wonderful.  I am going to order a few more pairs of them because they are so comfortable and flattering.
B00FHMQ10O|3|Too small but I love it had to give it away
B00KN2WK0S|5|Shirt is beautiful and with some jeans and gold heals.......SASSY.
B00FARAU12|5|I cant believe how good quality these are for the price. I will need to get some more. Would definitely recommend.
B003IFPG12|5|My son needed a plain black tee for a performance. This has a good fit and material. Exactly what I wanted.
B004ARZKJA|5|Great Product. Great Service. Great Value. Love It.
B00HWY9B3Y|5|Soft & comfy.  My Granddaughter said it is perfect for sleeping!
B00B8YPGL0|5|Got what I expected! Great buy!
B00NQH9HSA|5|This is my new favorite travel item.  Had to buy my sister one before mine disappear.
B0007YR9FI|5|Fit so well, I ordered two more!! Really like this bra. Great support and very comfortable!
B00IUCUGQS|4|Looks great, made well, the fabric is a bit sheer, though it is nice fabric.
B007KF1W3M|5|Great socks. My son said &#34;Oooh!! You bought me the soft socks!&#34; when he put them on this morning.
B009Y675PO|5|It looks amazing, fit just right, definitely not for those who are small up top. My bf absolutely loves it on me!
B00CBI9VVS|5|The shades of red are fully complemented by the neutral tones.  The length is perfect, and the material drapes beautifully.
B004WYY8A8|5|I ordered two of these. A medium first and then a small. The material is stretchy so the small stays ion a little better. However they both fit. I am 5'4\\" and generally wear a size 4 or 6.
B005L3H3VU|5|Love them
B003IMTXGO|3|my wife has a beautiful behind and some underwear she wears looks so good I can't stand it.  She doesn't seem to care whether she is wearing that type or cotton bloomers, so I took it upon myself to buy more of what I thought was my favorite pair - but this clearly isn't it.   I think she still looked good, but she complained they're too small.  I bought the next size up, and still too small.  My wife is very trim and has actually tightened things up back there (frankly too tight for me, but that is another story) so to give her something that makes her feel she took a step backwards - then to compound it with a larger size still too small - she said adamantly \\"don't buy me anymore of that!\\"  Message received - but if you're super skinny with the built of a prepubescent boy, then this maybe just the pair for you (thankfully, that is not my wife.)
B000ZHGBU6|4|It's really great quality with a stay up silicone lace top that actually works!!! The only thing is, they feel loose. But what do you expect from a &#34;one size fits most&#34;? However, the silicone stay up top helps with that. Overall great product with good quality and will definitely get the job done!!
B006B7WBDU|3|Better buy than bra itself. Made cheaply &does not fit well.<br />Couldve bought the same thing at kmart. Good luck!
B00EEFEBBQ|5|Bought this for my almost 2.5 year old daughter.  Looks great.
B00GBCW4N2|5|Large, but cute and comfortable.
B0017QOMK0|4|The shirt is great. The print screen is clear and the material of the shirt doesn't look cheap. I am a huge Monty Python fan so this was a great purchase.
B00FBD2G0I|5|These socks are great!  With sock prices being so high nowadays, it was great to find an inexpensive bulk package of quality mens socks!  You can find my exhaustive review here http://goo.gl/l5rjJy .  I'm wearing a few pairs of these socks until they completely wear out and then I will replace those pairs with a fresh pair.  The heel is reinforced and the toe is reinforced.  That adds to the value of these socks, as those are the areas that usually wear out first on inferior quality socks!
B00A4JTI2I|5|Awsome
B00NBLVTUK|5|These are GREAT for a rockin' look! Wore them to a U2 concert!
B0012N8D3U|5|this is an excellent fit.  no problems.<br />of course even with the best of care they have to be replaced more often than i would like/<br />but they are a good and comfortable fit
B000JJIEVY|4|This sweatshirt is extra heavy and thick, Great Sweatshirt. Will be great for our trip we are planning in cold weather. Thought we may need clothing under but actually it is so heavy you won't. Washes well too.<br />The only problem I had was the shipper used the smallest US Mail Letter packet to cram it in and tape the sides which also taped the sweatshirt inside and had it so crammed in this small letter packet by the time I receieved it it was hanging out and the packet was torn up. Bad shipping method.
B00EHMFMPU|4|I've had my 360 Jacket for a while now and it's been great. I normally wear a Medium T Shirt, but a large size jacket works best for me especially since I'm reaching forward on the bars. It's not too warm for California weather and the lights are super clear and visible. I like the slow strobe pattern the best. I'm only deducting one star because backpack straps will cover up most of the LEDs. It's still comfortable with a backpack on and some LEDs are still visible. The built in hood is an added bonus.
B006WFFY58|5|Looks great, get lots of compliments.  Different from the usual dress shirts.
B00JW56IY6|4|It is a snug fit but I still like the skirt.  It shows off all the curves and does not hide any flaws but it is a comfortable skirt.
B00E2P0OR8|3|run small  but is pretty
B00CTWHC5S|5|This shirt is just as expected, not only am I very happy with this product but I look forward to purchasing another one in the near future as well.
B005H5MIHQ|4|Was purchased for my daughter, who just loves the Chicago Bulls team.  She loves it, always taking pics in it
B004VMOER8|3|I am very disappointed in the quality of this garment. I purchased quite a bit of clothing for my grandchildren on Amazon, and this is the first and only piece that has ever disappointed me. The little shorts have what are supposed to be some type of pedal or flower coming around like a little skirt, but the pieces are so flimsy and so far apart that there is very little covering at all. The so-called cute fairy wings on the back of the top are very tiny and barely visible. The fabric itself of the outfit is kind of dull and coarse to the touch. I would expect something softer perhaps with more sheen to it than this if you're trying to construct a fairy to be costume. The embroidery on the top is nice however, and my darling little granddaughter couldn't care less about all the faults that I found in these clothes. She is more than happy to wear it. I just think it looks so silly as is.
B0033GYZWC|4|Heavy duty leather and well constructed for the price. I am happy with it. It serves my needs for an easy, comfortable way to carry any of my full size SAA pistols in a cross draw position.
B003X26SAS|1|this product isn't as good as it seems. The leather is bad quality and has started freying after just one use. The leathers colour is also very light and pale. it is quite thin. it was not really worth the wait or the money!!!! buy this belt if you want bad quality because it doesn't seem like real tommy hilfiger. i have a similar belt from tommy hilfiger and it did not do this after one use!!!
B00XY7FOGG|5|Good quality, but too I ordered it a size too small for me
B000BBC45C|5|Great item with an exceptional selection of colors, patterns to suit everyone's tastes.  Comfortable, spacious tote to put your books, music stuff, lunch and reading material or your weekend getaway items.  Absolutely love it.
B00UBAMRU0|5|Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. A little bit thinner and I expected but I always wear a Pettiecoat  so it doesn't matter for me
B0015N1OOC|5|I loved this shirt. The coolers are much brighter in person and shipping was very fast. I loved it so much I got another for my friend Jackie (loves it).
B00LU1H1LO|5|Really like the fit of these shorts. I am 5'1&#34; 105 lbs and the x-small fits perfect.
B00S4LG8MQ|2|It's WAY small - and I'm a woman who wears men's clothing often and know how things fit.  It's NOT long either, btw.  The fabric is stretchy.  The V is not very deep.  The color is a tad &#34;artificial&#34; for lack of a better word.  I hoped to use it as a night shirt, since it was &#34;long&#34; but it barely comes to my hips (and I'm short).  So - if you're a guy and want to show off your abs and pecks, by all means, this will do it.  If you want a shirt to fit well, it runs extremely small.  Cotton?  It doesn't feel like cotton to me.
B00JUJIOJ6|4|Followed previous reviews n ordered a bigger next size n fits perfect 
B0064D7ZOQ|4|Good looking Saturday pants. Very comfortable.<br /><br />The waist is noticeably bigger than other pants of the same alleged size. The main problem is that the pants really emphasize my buttlessness. There's room for two cantaloupes back there.
B0007QQN76|5|I had one of these wallets for 10 years and it was still holding together. I was just considering sending it in for the free replacement when it was stolen, so I had to buy a new one.
B00J2D7QTO|5|Great palazzo pants, wash and wear well.
B003R9FRRC|4|Stockings. What to say. They're cheap.
B005HG58RW|1|This product is NOT true to size. I am a size 14 in jeans so i ordered an extra large just to be on the safe side and i could not even get the leggings past my thighs. I am very upset because i ordered these for my birthday which is in 3 days and i paid extra to rush the order and now i have to find a new outfit to wear. They are good quality leggings but definitly not true to size. The extra large fit more of like a medium.
B00BJ9IZQ2|2|The size isn't the issue really for it did fit.  The issue is that it must be made for someone without any bust to speak of.  The chest area is so flat and straight that my DD chest is squished beyond recognition.  No matter which why I loosened or tightened it, the chest area is all wrong.  So disappointed!
B00LI6RJP4|1|Very disappointed...too small
B00FSMII3Q|4|Adorable Mickey Mouse sweatshirt. Soft inside and washed well. Only complaint is that the head hole is pretty small, but it ended up being great because it kept our kiddo warm.
B00EI53MLW|5|I bought this hoodie for my son for Christmas.  He loves it! He does not like bulky coats (neither do I) which is why I bought this. It seems to be great quality, nice looking, very soft, warm & the price was exceptional.  As a matter of fact I liked it so much, I bought two more, one for me & one for my husband.  Highly recommend!!!
B002N3AMCS|5|My 12-year-old wore this for Halloween this year.  SOOO cute.
B00882R94W|5|Cute hat that dresses up my white denims. Just way too large so have to pin it on with 'old fashioned' bobbypins.
B00EOM8Z8O|5|Thanks it fits very well.<br />Thanks it fits very well.<br />Thanks it fits very well.<br />Thanks it fits very well.<br />Thanks it fits very well.
B00CK3SDUE|5|I bought these for my gf and she loves them  it definitely does what it says. Her friends thinks she's been working out and she gets lots of stares (which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how confident you are getting stares) so my honest opinion as a guy from NY is this...if you want your girl to have a &#34;Sista booty&#34; and you don't mind other people looking at your woman's booty then i'd definitely say buy them for your woman. They definitely lift and make it look rounder.
B00AH7HIVU|3|I bought a women's XL - this is far from correct - this shirt was so small if fit more like a Youth XL - not adult size.
B0007VZ4Y4|3|this was good for work and I was able to wear them more than once or twice. it's a good buy.
B00G28FXFQ|5|was very disappointed in this product
B008AKOGAM|2|I ordered this in black and I had assumed that it would be all black. However, the pleated lines towards the bottom were stitched with red thread instead. Also, the material was quite static-y. I usually like my abayas to cover my feet; well, although this abaya met this criteria, the material picks up dirt and lint easily. As a result, after a day of wearing this to school, I found an assortment of hairs lining the bottom of the abaya. Also, if you plan on wearing this on top of corduroy pants, know that he material will stick to the pants making it extremely difficult to walk in. However, I do like the cut of this abaya, and hopefully using a powerful lint remover--it looks more gray than black after washing and drying--I'll be able to wear it to clean places such as the masjid.
B005CJNXTO|5|These pants are a great buy. I have them in New British, Khaki, and Dark Brown. I am going to purchase more colors as soon as Christmas passes. I initially bought them for new going out pants, but now I wear them to work and they wear great. They are not metro/emo slim, so I do not feel weird wearing them to work.They do not bunch or cinch anywhere, but my only complaint would be they have less pocket room, but oh well, cant have slim pants and have oodles of pocket room like you can in regular or relaxed fit.
B004LL5GEO|5|First time trying these and I must say i love the fit.  It's comfortable and snugs, no waistline irritation. Love em
B00LJ0F56Y|4|Fits perfect
B002FT73KY|3|Really liked the look of this when I ordered it, but the chain broke in half after I wore it a few times.  A local jeweler fixed it for me, but now two months later it has tarnished all around the circle and looks very dull.  Would not order again.
B003EHWMAC|5|very cute--I ordered shoes to match!
