B001N1DPDE|5.0|This a a hefty knife that feels great in the hands. You really feel confident in it once you hold it. With a 1/4inch and 1 pound weight, it sure excels in batoning small diameter logs,prying, and light chopping. The big belly makes it a wonderful kitchen knife when it is not hacking pieces of wood. I've used it to open young coconuts which are surprisingly hard and this knife has no problem piercing the shell and prying the top off. The extended pommel allows me to use a rubber mallet to drive it into the coconuts. Tip strength is great. Could be sharper out of the box but nothing a little touching up can't take care of. If you want a good all-around knife and don't mind carrying the 1 pound heft (which in my opinions gives more advantages than disadvantages) this is your knife. Lastly, at such a low price point, it is a must have. The sheath is ok but I found that it retained the knife a little too tightly, making it difficult to get out. I used a heat gun to make the pressure retention point a little softer and then cooled it wedged a little wider so it wouldn't hold the knife too tightly, but still tight enough to prevent the knife from slipping out when carried upside down. Also I have read that the sheath has a design flaw in that it dulls the knife every time you take the knife out and put it back in since the edge of the knife cuts into the sheath. I haven't seen this yet with my sheath so it might be a quality control issue but still experimenting. Many others have gotten a customized kydex sheath to take care of this problem.

1476712042|5.0|I am going to be honest. I picked up this book not knowing anything about the story or the author who wrote it. Once I opened to the first page, I never put it down! I read Beautiful Disaster 3 times in one week! Absolutely loved it! It is without a doubt one of the most amazing love stories I have ever read. Jamie has a twist on every page that leaves you constantly guessing and your adrenaline pumping! You never know what to expect with each chapter and the suspense will keep you up at night! I simply cannot express in enough words how incredibly written this novel is! I look forward to reading all of her other works and the ones to come.
0062183591|5.0|This is Ariely's third book. He does not rest on his laurels though and this book is just as good as his previous ones. Ariely challenges what appears obvious to earthlings. He designs creative studies to test whether our most obvious gut feelings are indeed true. What readers find may be both surprising and incredibly entertaining. Ariely's lessons can be used to improve different aspects of your organization, society or personal life.<br /><br />I found the section on the effect of wearing fake brand names on honesty particularly amusing. Earlier on Ariely pointed out how pharmaceutical reps manipulate physicians by various strategies (ie: free lunches for them and their staff, golf trips, etc...). Then he talked about how he gave a talk for the fashion industry and he was subsequently given a free Prada handbag as a thank you gift. Later on he was provided with samples of designer handbags and sunglasses (he borrowed the items) as part of a study that he designed. Could these services have affected the way Ariely designed his study and his conclusions? As he demonstrated convincingly in his book humans can be manipulated in various ways. In fact you would expect a behavioral economist to point out the ridiculousness of spending money on expensive brand name items (for example, he has pointed out the irrationality of spending money on expensive wines in the past). But his study puts a positive light on wearing genuine brand names. I am not doubting that there are positive aspects of wearing genuine brands and negative aspects of wearing fakes. I just wonder whether what a researcher chooses to emphasize may be affected by favors. He concludes that people who wear fake brand names are more dishonest. Could he have designed a different study to demonstrate that in general people who wear high price brands are dishonest? My guess is that given the kindness of the folks who provided him with the brands, he would be hesitant to reach such a conclusion. For purity sake,I would have preferred if he had actually bought the samples for his study instead of getting them for free. That certainly would be very expensive. His getting free samples for his study is no different than when researchers are paid by the pharmaceutical companies to study their drugs. By the way, I am a physician and admit that I have been manipulated by pharmaceutical reps in the past.<br /><br />Ariely is very enthusiastic about his work and it is contagious. In this book he tackles honesty. I did not agree with all his interpretations of his studies and presume many other readers will not always agree either. But we have to remember that he is tackling a social science where there is room  for different interpretations. Nevertheless, he makes you think and question your gut feelings. This was a very delightful book and probably among the top three books I have read in the past 12 months. Strongly recommended.
034580404X|5.0|I'm totally obsessed!!! I've read the trilogy twice in one month....its a great read. Behind the intense \\"love/bondage\\" scenarios is a deep love story.
0062060562|2.0|This book is not unpleasant. The story is intriguing enough, and I suppose one shouldn't look for meaningful stories in a thriller, but the author does touch on some important themes. However, the style of the writing and the characters left me unmoved. The repetitions and the fact that the narrative never goes beyond the usual dialogue/action/descriptions to convey ideas tether this book to the realm of average. In spite of the millions of copies sold, I don't think this book deserves its fame. There's a point in the story where you feel that this could develop into something really interesting, but then the writer takes the easy option out and it all falls into place the way perfectly in the way things to in movies, not real life. How unimaginative. A much more deserving alternative to this story is Karin Altvegen's Betrayal, which at least has been written in a more compelling style.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it. Its just like playing Mario Bros, which I loved playing on the old nintendo. I hope there's a second one,  soon.
1594744769|1.0|As other reviewers have mentioned, this book has a fairly good beginning. The pictures are intriguing, enough to motivate you to read on even though right off you feel like you're reading teenage fiction. But you go along with the adventure, and then something happens: not sure what, but it seems that the writer run out of steam. Suddenly the story stops, and you're left leafing through the pages while episodes are created to justify the presence of these weird photographs. I would have rather had no pictures and a good story, thank you! I'm 3/4 of the way through and I've abandoned the hope that the story will recover. Better move on to something else. This book made me wish that the Chinese model of micro publishing was available- where you buy a book a chapter at a time so if you abandon it half way through because it's disappointing you haven't wasted that much money...
B007SGM084|5.0|This is a book that deals with a lot of human in securties. But the writer does it with a human instict which is (sex). I found the characters to be very strong and courgeous They are so well written you form a image in your mind as to what they look like. You could even see the surrondings they where in. To me it was like watching a movie. Well done
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|The game was very interesting and good though it could have been better. Some of the objects were to small to see let alone find and the shadow image of items didn't always match the item to be found. There were little to no instructions for the mini games.
B008MEM24S|4.0|It is a game directed to kids but its fun even if you are not one. the little blurbs from the characters get annoying after s while but you can just turn them off.
0345803493|5.0|I'm way behind the pack in reading this trilogy but can't wait to start the last one.  What an unexpected ending.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I've been playing this game for over a month now, have a lovely little town but am tired of not having enough energy to keep up with it.. The game only allows you 50 energy and it's not nearly enough to cover collecting money AND food.. Sadly, the greedy gluttons who have created the game insist on forcing players to pay for energy and for items needed to complete quests.. I might go along with this IF the prices they want for their 'cash' wasn't so high.. $20 dollars for 55 game 'cash'??!! Come on, what's with that, Gameloft!? When I can go into Gamehouse or Popcap Games or a 1/2 dozen other sites and purchase full rights to play a game in perpetuity on my laptop for $19 or less, why in the world am I going to play one on my Kindle that continuously takes my hard earned money out of my pocket in order to play.. Not going to happen and I suspect these APP type games that do this will soon fall by the wayside unless they change their greedy tactics.. Just to let you know, if you're thinking of playing this game, too little energy and having to pay 'real' money to buy items is NOT the only problem with it.. When you are trying to design your town you get constant interruptions like tornadoes, outlaw bands and cattle stampedes.. At first these are pretty harmless, you can either pay with the game 'cash' that cost you real money to avoid ANY damage or you can use the pretend money the game gives you but you suffer SOME damage.. Animals get hurt and buildings get damaged.. As I said, this is not too bad when you first start playing but each time one of these happens (and they start happening a LOT as you continue building your town) the 'game money' price goes up and up, so when you first start out it may cost you a few hundred to avoid most of the damage, but later on it costs you thousands and thousands of game money and the cost of using your 'purchased cash' also goes up as the game progresses.. In other words, you pretty much can't win for losing!<br />These annoying 'disasters' increase so much that by the time you hit levels in the 60s and 70's, they can nearly bankrupt you as they happen time after time and the cost is in the thousands.. Even if you collected all the money from your buildings it's likely that just one of these 'disasters' can take back all the money you just gained and they can happen within just a few minutes of each other.. It's all about greed as far as the game designers are concerned! These disasters are deliberately designed to 'encourage' (if that is the right word) players to spend 'real' money in order to avoid receiving ANY damage from them..<br /><br />My advice, unless your rich and can afford to keep dumping money into playing games like this, is to stay away from them.. Stick with online games you can purchase ONCE and play forever..<br /><br />My rating for the company that has created this money-pit is 1 measly star..g 'disasters' increase so much that by the time you hit levels in the 60s and 70's, they can nearly bankrupt you as they happen time after time and the cost is in the thousands..

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It was an awesome book, any and all married couples should read and do as Dr. Chappman suggest. Be a blessing to your spouse!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Add my name to the list of readers who felt that this book falls well short of the mark. Based on its phenomenal success, I was certain I was in for a real thrill ride. Instead, what I got was a reasonably entertaining -- but by no means spectacular -- reading experience. The future world Collins has created isn't particularly well thought out, and some of the technology -- such as the ability to record video and audio anywhere in the so-called \\"arena\\" (actually some kind of artificial wilderness area) seems to defy common sense. At the very least it demands some further explanation. How in the world could a whispered conversation between two people in a tiny, improvised, pitch-black cave be broadcast live to the world? Where would they place the camera? Collins made some other choices that struck me as bordering on being just plain silly -- like calling her genetically-engineered creatures \\"muttations.\\" The writing is mostly okay, although it has clearly been dumbed-down to suit younger readers. All in all, I'd have to rate this one \\"O\\" -- for Overrated.
B00632HWOG|5.0|UPDATE: after the most recent update, the app did not function correctly anymore.  HOWEVER, upon reading other reviews, I noticed one that said to uninstall & reinstall... THIS WORKED FOR ME.  No more issues since uninstalling & reinstalling after the update.<br /><br />Unlike the mail app included with the kindle fire by default this app includes all the normal functionality as accessing Yahoo through web browser. Good free app

B0084B5TK8|5.0|I'd never read the book before & I can definitely see why its a classic! I don't like that is written in the form of diaries / letters / etc, but the underlying story is so great I couldn't put it down.

B004WJREMW|5.0|I loved this album, and had a cassette tape that finally unraveled and tore.  CDs are great, but I hadn't thought to try buying @ Amazon, but I am glad I did, for the economy and how quickly the product arrived. I'm currently listening to Wingspan, another purchase, but am sure I'll enjoy this one, too! Almost no one brightens my day with their music like Paul does!
0985114606|2.0|Though BARE TO YOU is an interesting and quick read, it doesn't have the character development that FIFTY SHADES OF GREY has...the descriptions of the characters are lacking as is the richness of their internal growth.  Outside events which exert pressure on Eva and Gideon make them change so rapidly that the reader can  hardly believe the intent is real and lose interest in their journey.  I actually didn't have a visual of the characters as I did in SHADES (after the first chapter) until the end of the book,  and not even then in any detail.  Though I will probably read the next book in the series, I am not nearly involved with the characters as I was in SHADES, which I reread several times.  I hope in the next book Ms. Day gives us more information, and connects the lives of the characters in a realistic  and more poignant development of their relationship , rather than the almost forced and unconvincing perspective which we surmise from the reading.
145162607X|5.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter by Philippa Gregory is the first sister story since The Other Boleyn Girl. In this one, Anne Neville and her sister Isabel's fate is held in the hands of their \\"Kingmaker\\" father, the Earl of Warwick.<br /><br />The Kingmaker's Daughter is a truly exciting and intriguing novel set in 15th-century England. Gregory is one of the masters of writing for this time period, and this novel doesn't disappoint at all. The scenes are detailed beautifully and the characters are so well crafted, it feels like you are watching a movie as you read it.<br /><br />The politics, court intrigue, family bonds and issues, and superstition weaved in magically is the perfect mixture for this novel. The characters really make the book for me, and Anne Neville really holds her own in it even though women don't hold the same type of power that men do.<br /><br />This piece of historical fiction is written beautifully, and I highly recommend it for fans of the author and those who are also intrigued by this time in history.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of The Kingmaker's Daughter, Touchstone, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.

B00846REIS|5.0|Very much enjoyed this book and will be looking for the next one to come. I finished this book in two days, and really fell in love with the characters. Did not want it to end.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|The item I ordered is really beautiful and the price is reasonable. I had never listened to Wagner's operas before so I decided to buy the Ring which is the most famous of Wagner's productions. The performance at Metropolitan Opera is very close to Wagner's indications. I think everyone should try to listen to at least twenty minutes of these four operas. Then you can never stop.....
B0012TWRAO|4.0|Strong and seems to work well. Easy to install and comes with some plastic inserts for different sized bars. RAM mount seems nice but expensive. Amazon is cheaper than when I have seen them in stores.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good trilogy but way too much explicit S&M for me. Held my attention with the storyline but had to skip the \\"bolder\\" parts.
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|This was a completely unexpected sound of Pink Floyd...one of their very first album...leaves you slack jawed saying 'What the Hell was that?!!!!\\" but in the end if you relax and forget the latest peices you can come to enjoy this bizarre cocophany of sound.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|Here is the whole plot:<br /><br />Government puts bad people into cryosleep in space.<br />Government also puts good guys who disagree with them in that prison.<br />There is a prison break and the bad guys control the space station with the presidents daughter and 'good' convict on board.<br /><br />From there you can guess what happens. All of the characters are bland and the plot 'twists' are just as predictable. I watched it from Redbox for $1 but that was a ripoff.<br /><br />If you have children though who like guns and gore, this is for them. Becuase the writing is on par with dora the explorer.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Having grown up with Earth wind and Fire playing on the radio, I was familiar with their music, but only to a certain extent. But I didn't want to get an album of their music that might not be everything I wanted. I settled for Greatest Hits...yes it is an easy way out, but to be on the safe side, you get the most popular, even if the songs are at times rather obscure, as several I don't recall at all. Overall this CD was the perfect place to start, in revisiting the music and finding out how much it moved me.
1455502758|5.0|It came as no surprise that one of the greatest and most remarkable troublemakers and polemicists Britain has ever produced didn't leave without having a few important things to say. The late great Christopher Hitchens used the pages of Vanity Fair during his battle against a tumor in his esophagus to partly apply the maxim of Dylan Thomas to \\"rage, rage against the dying of the light\\". That said you sense throughout the pages of \\"Mortality\\", a book collecting those special essays, that Hitchens instinctively felt that this was one argument he wasn't going to win. As such his tangle with death is a level headed but poignant dalliance with the slow degradation of a body which graphically charts the \\"wager\\" with chemotherapy taking \\"your taste buds, your ability to concentrate, your ability to digest and the hair on your head\\". He is painfully honest and reflective throughout about his predicament not least the \\"gnawing sense of waste\\" and the reality of becoming an early \\"finalist in the race of life\\". Yet it wouldn't be Hitchens if the opportunity for settling some old scores was not taken and in particular his restatement of his vociferous views on atheism despite the fact that September 20th 2010 was designated by one religious website as \\"Everyone pray for Hitchens day\\".<br /><br />Others were less charitable for in some quarters at the onset of Hitchens illness produced a vicious form of schadenfreude not least amongst his many enemies in the Christian right where his strong opinions on religion had provoked and outraged those not prepared to countenance any debate. He quotes an opinion from an religious blog that viewed his throat cancer as \\"Gods revenge for him using his voice to blaspheme him\\". Undoubtedly most Christians would find such a view repugnant but in any case Hitchens would have no truck with such nonsense. In his autobiography \\"Hitch 22\\" he was candid about a lifestyle that some described as \\"convivial\\" while others though \\"excessive\\" a better term. He argued alternatively that a cigarette permanently locked in his hand and the love of a \\"second bottle\\" were as much sources of inspiration for his writing as his limited repertoire of heroes like Paine and Orwell. He knew the source of his problems but that's not the point of this book. It is in essence a slow diary of his journey through \\"\\"Tumortown\\" its excruciating levels of pain, the corresponding fatalism and resignation, its false hopes and eventual knock out blow. There are brilliant passages on figures as diverse as Leonard Cohen, and Nietzsche, a revisiting of the waterboarding torture which Hitchens endured to attack the Bush administration with a about with a searing polemic and finally a weariness at the offerings of possible cancer cures. `You sometimes feel that you may expire from sheer ADVICE\\", he exclaims in frustration<br /><br />This short book concludes with a chapter of fragmentary jottings which are in every sense the most affecting part of the book. The broken phrases and quotes show a mind that thinks deeply, still questioning, still at work and debating until the very last. This is despite of \\"Chemo-brain. Dull, stuporous\\" and fears that this \\"lavish torture is only the prelude to a gruesome execution\\". Hitchens also brilliantly unearths a quote from Saul Bellow which argues with simple insight that \\"death is the dark backing that a mirror needs if we are able to see anything\\". Christopher Eric Hitchens was a man who did his fair share of seeing not least on his many travels to chart despotism and dictatorship and to rally against it with clarity not heard since George Orwell. He also always had the right words even when he was fundamentally wrong and the best of his writings are furiously brilliant, deserving the widest readership whether you agree with him or not. Hitchens died on 15th December 2011, and this the book concludes with a tender \\"Afterword\\" from his widow Carol Blue. At one point in \\"Mortality\\" the author quotes Horace Mann's observation that \\"Until you have done something for humanity you should be ashamed to die\\". In the case of the sadly lamented and much missed Christopher Hitchens there was no need to worry about this, you did more than enough.ann's observation that \\"Until you have done something for humanity you should be ashamed to die\\". In the case of the sadly lamented and much missed Christopher Hitchens there was no need to worry about this, you did more than enough.

B008CWD17M|5.0|This is definitely Asia's best project since all four original members reunited. They have returned to their original 80's sound with a fresh, new feeling. John Wetton has never sounded better. Geoff Downes and Steve Howe collaberated well together and came up with some amazing melodies. Carl Palmer sounds fantastic as always, and my only complaint about this album is that the drums could have been better produced to bring out Palmer's amazing talent. This is a project that all Asia fans, old and new, will enjoy!

I want it the first day.

B007V508CC|1.0|I've been a Maroon 5 fan since 2004 when they released their first album Songs About Jane. The following years showed a gradual decrease in the quality of their music and Overexposed their most recent album is the worse they've ever made so far.<br /><br />This album is a slap in the face to all of those who enjoyed Songs About Jane and the Old Maroon 5. It's poppy overly so & the abundance of auto tone used is ridicules. Now, with a title such as *Overexposed* you would think their songs are going to be about Controversial/Taboo topics or at least that's what I thought. Sure, I've heard the single Payphone before the album was even released and it wasn't controversial or revolutionary in anyway if anything it was no different than your average Modern Pop Music that you'll hear on the radio talking about heartbreak and love in such a cliche underwhelming manner and lousy lyrics. But, hey I decided for once not to be too judgmental and give the album a listen before I conclude that it's horrible based on one song. Maybe, Payphone was the odd song on the album and was meant to attract radio listeners and encourage them to buy the album? You know as a publicity stunt? Maybe, the album holds some depth to it and isn't filled with cheesy pop beats and overly simplified lyrics? Maybe the topics or the concepts that the songs revolve around are substational and refreshing? Yeah, well after listening to every single song on the album and paying attention to the lyrics my expectations were unmet. This is everything I despise and hate about pop music. This album specifically is a living proof to why a decent band like Maroon 5 can turn into nothing but a brainwashed musical act that sounds like everything else you'll ever hear on the radio.<br /><br />Let Me see, the songs aren't catchy *most of them* if anything they sound like something you'll hand produce through your garageband. The beats are overly repetitive that when I heard the entire album at one sitting at times I didn't know when one song ended and when the other one started because they sounded so familiar. The instruments used is virtually nonexistent, there's only one song where you can clearly say that there's an actual piano play in it and that song is Sad. It also happens to be the best song on the album because it doesn't rely on auto tone and Adam actually sings in it. The rest of the tracks, I don't think there was any genuine instrumental play and if there was it was butchered by auto tone so I wouldn't notice. The topics the songs represented where recycled and lame. Unlike what I hoped they weren't controversial subjects like politics, prostitution or I don't know the illuminati? Whatever, is controversial nowadays they were all about love or rather the equivalent of love in pop culture which is lust to put it more appropriately. Even, the songs that were meant to be about heartbreak and betrayal were filled with electronic beats it was quite hard to take them seriously. The lyrics sometimes are not that bad but the abuse of auto tone makes it sound horrible, and they were other times when the lyrics were quite frankly stupid and nothing we haven't heard before.<br /><br />So, is this album worth buying you ask? Not for me it isn't. If you're a faithful Maroon 5 fan that must have each and every album of theirs then I can understand why you would want to pay money with such economy struggles to have this album in your collection but even as a fellow fan I have to admit this album sucked very bad. I've only ever liked two songs actually Sad and One More Night and even those two are a far cry from Maroon 5's best works. Payphone is the Worse track on this album but the rest don't really stand out as individual tracks either because they hardly sound different they almost blend into one huge song that takes up the rest of the album.<br /><br />Is there any other redeeming qualities this album might possess? Hmm, hardly if ever but the Album Artwork is pretty legit don't you think? Too bad the producer didn't have the same originality and good taste as the artist did.<br /><br />Listen to the samples before you buy it and judge for yourself.n't you think? Too bad the producer didn't have the same originality and good taste as the artist did.<br /><br />Listen to the samples before you buy it and judge for yourself.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I really wanted to like Camille Preaker but Ms. Flynn didn't make it easy.  What I did like was the suspense that she keeps you in regarding the plot.<br />I'm not one to give away the entire book in my review, but suffice it to say that was one messed up family!<br /><br />Now, regarding the inconsistencies: here's Camille in the heat of the south in long sleeves, being pursued by a long-overdue sexual interest and she hides herself like a Nun.  Then let's some teenage punk see it all?  I couldn't go for it!<br /><br />My Book Club read it for the interest of Miss Flynn hailing from our part of the US, but I'm not sure I'll be giving her another try. Sorry!

I am a HUGE Herbie Hancock fan, and Freddie Hubbard is my inspiration. Some of their best jamming here, especially in their later years of life.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|There were so many themes to this story; the plight of children in foster care who become homeless adults, the impact of genuinely nice people reaching out to help others, the complexity of family feuds and how they affect generations, the cultural and scientific history of flowers and vineyards.  Yet, it is all woven together through complex but believable characters in a moving, genuine and well written story.  An easy read, but thoroughly enjoyable.

B0078JOAOI|4.0|This is one of those episodes that meanders along but has a wild punchline at the end. As a whole, the episode still doesn't match the ferocity of the Season One episodes, but holding it against the standard of the Season Two episodes, I would say it is one of the better episodes.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Episode recap:<br /><br />Immediately after the massacre of the zombies on his farm, Hershel demands the group get off his land.<br /><br />Shane continues his out-of-control rampage at the beginning of the episode. He accuses Hershel of hiding Sophia from them (in the barn with the zombies), which grieving Hershel denies. Shane has the nerve to do this right after he has slaughtered all of Hershel's zombie \\"family\\" which, although zombies, Hershel thinks he can still save.<br /><br />The group cleans up the zombies they killed in the barn. They have a funeral for Sophia and for Hershel's wife and stepson. The rest they burn. Hershel disappears and they can't find him. His daughter Beth, who appears to have been bitten by a zombie, has collapsed and gone into a catatonic state; and they need to find him. It appears Hershel may have started drinking again, as he has saved a large collection of his dead wife's things and kept them even when she became a zombie. Now that she has been massacred, it all seems to have been too much for Hershel to take. They find an empty flask, and Rick goes to check out a tavern in town where Hershel may have gone in search of alcohol.<br /><br />But before Rick can take off, his wife throws the book at him, with guilt trips about his son, and saying Shane was right to clear the walkers from the barn, and begging him not to go after Hershel and to stop solving everyone else's problems: she says that her son needs him. Shane also tries to cut him off at the knees, and saying he was right in clearing the walkers from the barn and that Rick was wrong to try to stop him, but for once, Rick doesn't listen to Shane or his wife, and stands up to both of them, defending his own actions. Rick is finally certain that he is on the right path, and he is listening to his inner voice loudly and clearly. \\"It's not just his problem I'm trying to solve,\\" he tells Lori. \\"We need Hershel for the baby,\\" he explains. But we know that isn't all of it. Rick has also hinted that after everything they did to Hershel ... massacreing his \\"family\\" of zombies, his wife and stepson in the barn, Rick is going to try to make it up to Hershel and help him in his time of need, regardless of whether anyone else understands.<br /><br />Shane is washing up behind the barn when Carol comes stumbling out of the woods looking disheveled and dirty and grieving. Shane sits her down and washes her hands and apologizes to her. He says he was just trying to keep everyone safe and he had no idea that Sophia was in the barn. He says that he is sorry about her little girl. Shane looks for a second like a lost little boy. But he still has that sociopathic air about him.<br /><br />Dale is not happy about the massacre and not happy that others went along with it willingly and agreed with Shane. He talks to Lori about it, who tells Dale that she agrees with Shane that the walkers needed to be cleared from the barn.<br /><br />Dale tells Lori that Shane is dangerous. He tells Lori that he believes Shane killed Otis. Lori doesn't believe him. She says Otis was killed by walkers. Dale says that Otis knew how to handle walkers: Otis was the one that was putting them in the barn! Dale says, \\"I believe that Shane sacrificed Otis. I can't prove it, but I think that he shot him and left him for bait so that he could get away.\\" Lori looks dumbfounded. She tells Dale she doesn't believe Shane is a murderer. Dale argues that he can't prove it, but that Shane all but said it, all but threw it in his face. \\"I knew guys like him,\\" Dale said. \\"And sooner or later, he's gonna kill somebody else.\\"<br /><br />Glenn goes with Rick into town to look for Hershel. They find him at the bar and try to persuade him to come home. Meanwhile at home, Beth is getting worse and Lori feels it can't wait. She gets in the car to go to town by herself to bring back Rick, Glenn and Hershel. On her way to town she crashes into a zombie, flips and totals her car.<br /><br />Rick can't persuade Hershel to leave the bar. He finally tells him, \\"This isn't about what we believe anymore. It's about them.\\" (The group; their loved ones.) Hershel agrees, and gets ready to leave with Rick, when in walk two strangers.<br /><br />They aren't friendly. They need a place to stay ... permanently. They are scouting for them and a larger group, and they are ready to kill for the farmland. Rick kills both of them.<br /><br />~~~~<br /><br />Notes about the writing: This is the same writer who wrote the episode \\"Cherokee Rose,\\" although I think this episode is much better than Cherokee Rose.

0345803493|2.0|Well one was not enough for me; I borrowed number two and three.  So for Fifty Shades of Darker, James takes me on yet another journey filled with non-stop erotic sex that blows both Christian/Ana's minds.  I sure wish I could have such great sex all the time and nearly every day!!<br /><br />James introduces a little drama by adding danger into the mix.  A jealous guy and erotic past lover wants to hurt Christian, his family and possibly Ana - come on.  During all this Christian tells his sob story of his upbringing which is why he has trouble with vanilla love.  This was supposed to draw me into the story and give me feelings for Grey, but it did neither.<br /><br />So I keep on reading and maybe this one was a little better due to the story developing more than just a non-stop romp session, but not much better.  Still I'm reading, but not for the story.

B007E6YYLO|4.0|*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />In this episode, Glen Mazzara, the show's executive producer in the show's second season, steps up as writer once again. Mazzara has written two other episodes so far, including Episode Five in Season One as a co-writer. Also from Season One we have director Guy Ferland, who directed Episode Six in Season One. With only four episodes left for this season, I'm hoping for a good collaboration, and in this episode, we get a really good one. I wish they would bring back more of the writers and directors from Season One, as they had a real sense of what the show was!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this episode. They built a lot of tension by knowing when to cut from one scene to another. Very nice job done by director Guy Ferland.<br /><br />Episode recap:<br /><br />In the beginning we see a chilling scene in which Shane locks himself in a school bus to escape zombies, and Rick is running for his life. No context is provided.<br /><br />~~Opening credits~~<br /><br />Then we see Shane and Rick on the highway. They are going to drive 18 miles out to drop Randall off to fend for himself. Rick stops in the middle of the road to set things straight between him and Shane. He tells Shane how it is: if Shane can't accept reality, how it is between Rick, Lori and Carl, then it is over between Rick and Shane.<br /><br />Shane never really gives Rick a straight answer. He just starts talking about how bad things were when Rick was in the hospital, and how Lori and Carl kept him together. He says if he could take it all back he would, but he never actually states that he WILL take it back. Big difference.<br /><br />They drive until they find a place that appears safe enough to leave Randall -- the Merit County Department of Public Works buildings complex -- except they do have to kill a couple of walkers on the property who are in uniform. There are bodies there that don't have scratches on them. And corpses. The place doesn't look safe. There are government buildings, which indicates a high rate of occupancy at some point. It is gated. We see the school bus from the opening scene, so already we know that Rick and Shane are going to run into trouble.<br /><br />Back at the house, Beth, Hershel's daughter, has woken up. Her fever has broken and she is okay physically, but mentally she isn't. She is suicidal.<br /><br />Back at the town, Randall is pleading for his life. Rick and Shane ignore him until he says he went to school with Maggie. Shane's first instinct is to shoot him, because he knows where the farm is, and he can take the attackers, the rival gang, to the farm. Rick stops him. But Rick and Shane end up in a life-and-death struggle as Shane says that Rick can't keep his family safe. Shane throws a very heavy object meant to kill Rick, but instead it ends up going through a window. It opens up a zombie nest. Rick kills the first one and the rest go after Shane.<br /><br />Back at the house, Andrea tells Lori that she shouldn't have taken the knife away from Beth: that if Beth wants to commit suicide she should have been allowed to do so. Andrea is pretty cold-blooded. Meanwhile Maggie is having a heated family argument with Beth trying to convince Beth why she should want to live. Lori and Andrea have the bitch fight of all bitch fights.<br /><br />Back at the town, Rick is fighting for his life and so is Randall, who has worked free of his ankle bonds. Rick and Randall leave, leaving Shane trapped in the school bus surrounded by zombies. At least, that's what we think. He's just getting the car. He comes back and saves Shane.<br /><br />At the house, Beth argues in favor of suicide. She says it is better to do it now, while they have the choice, than when they are forced to do it when the farm is overrun with zombies. She asks Maggie to join with her in a suicide pact. Maggie is horrified. Then Andrea comes and offers to sit with Beth. Maggie insists she cannot leave Beth. But Andrea looks at her as if to say, trust me. I've got it. So Beth leaves and Andrea enters Beth's room. Then Andrea leaves the bathroom door open so that Beth can take her life. Maggie discovers Beth is locked in the bathroom and has slit her wrists. They find her in time. Andrea comes running from outside and wants to know how deep the cuts are. She says that since they aren't very deep, Beth didn't really want to kill herself. Maggie tells Andrea to stay away from Beth and to never come inside the house again.<br /><br />Rick tells Shane if he is going to kill him, he is going to have to do better than that. And that he is going to have to trust Rick's leadership if he wants to be part of the group. And that Rick is probably going to have to kill Randall in the morning, but he wants to sleep on it.

6300274268|1.0|First, this was not the VHS I ordered. I ordered Alice in Wonderland VHS Disney Masterpiece. I was trying to complete my collection. The item I received appeared brand new, in a cardboard slip cover, and arrived immediately. I just wish it had been the selection shown [[ASIN:6300274268 Alice in Wonderland (Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection) [VHS]]]on Amazon.com. The review photo of the VHS is correct, but I guess your link wasn't??
0345803485|3.0|Well I jumped on the band wagon and read the trilogy and thought long and hard about whether I should write a review and let everyone know I read such books as these, but in the end since they are so popular I figured it should be ok and that I will not be judged to harshly when future employers look at my reading habits.<br /><br />The first things I must say about these books are that James paints a vivid picture and tells a story that makes you long for the next page.  So I start off with saying that I really loved them despite their simplicity, repetition and sometimes lack of imagination.  Maybe I don't ask for much out of a book other than to distract me from what is usually a very boring life.  I would never read this if I wasn't a geo-bachelor in the Army living a good portion of my life away from my wife and kids; this stuff just couldn't compete with my time.<br />So, I must say I fell in love with the characters, and the sex scenes from the start really got my engines going, yet as I moved forward James did not deliver on what I expected.  I so wanted her to go down the dark alternate lifestyle alley that she started, but maybe that was just a step too far for her audience and mass appeal that she captured.<br /><br />The story and character makeup was just too over the top, but I'll let it slide, because really who cares this book really was just fluff to keep the reader interested long enough for the next sex scene.  I can't believe I was strung along for three whole books, but I guess that speaks to what a sex depraved man I am and how this was the most acceptable form of near-porn that I could read in the open.<br /><br />So Christian and all his sex expertise proves to drive his women to orgasm at least every tenth page or so.  Unbelievable, yes, so much sex definitely, but hey I kept on reading.<br /><br />I didn't spend money on these books, and now I'm glad to be done; not sure I'm a better person for reading this one?
0064430170|5.0|I bought this for a friend's son, becacuse my family read it to me as a baby. It's simple, adorable, an easy read for Mom, and a classic that every baby should have, and the best part is, you can read it over and over again, and you'll never get tired of it. Well worth the purchase.

B007B8GI28|4.0|*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />The reason I titled this \\"Hurry Up and Wait\\" is because that is what we have been doing all of Season Two. As of the end of the last episode:<br /><br />Shane is set to go psychotic and kill someone. This has been this way for several episodes. When will it happen and who will he kill?<br /><br />Lori's car is in a ditch and she may have been eaten by a zombie.<br /><br />Hershel's daughter Beth is running a high fever: is she turning into a zombie? By the end of this episode, they have stretched this into two episodes going on three and no answer yet.<br /><br />Will they have to leave the farm before Lori has her baby? (Pretty sure the answer to that one is yes: no way the writers are gonna let us stick around a year on the farm!)<br /><br />We're also waiting for Shane to abduct Lori and Carl Grimes. Don't tell me you haven't been thinking it too.<br /><br />If this were Season One, all of these things would have happened already, and we'd be watching these episodes as fast as we could to keep up with the plot points. Instead, we are watching a fog of dialog as the episodes pass in a slow haze, waiting for something to happen.<br /><br />So now that is out of the way, here is my episode recap. The good news is, in Season Two fashion, it is setting the stage for some major events by the end of this episode. I do find myself looking forward to the next episode, but wish they would move the action along at a quicker pace. They don't have anything fast happening in Season Two like they did in Season One, and that continues to be a disappointment.<br /><br />EPISODE RECAP:<br /><br />Back at the farm, the group realizes Lori is missing. Shane goes after her. He finds her and Lori wants to go after Rick. Shane lies and says Rick is safe back at the farm. When Lori discovers Rick isn't at the farm, Shane says he didn't tell her because he wanted to make sure the baby was all right, which is surprising to everyone who did not know Lori's secret but which has suddenly become public knowledge. Lori tells Shane that Rick knows about her and Shane. Shane confronts her and says that their love was real and had nothing to do with a \\"rebound\\" relationship\\" as Lori says it was. Shane has plenty of these obsessive moments and I think we can all see where this is leading: the guy is either going to kidnap or hurt Lori and Carl.<br /><br />Rick, Hershel and Glenn get pinned down in the bar by gunfire by some of the friends of guys they killed. The attackers finally leave when the town is overrun by walkers. One of the attackers, Randall, is stuck when his leg is impaled on a fence. Hershel amputates the guy's leg to get him off the fence. They barely escape and take him back to the farm blindfolded.<br /><br />Daryl has pulled away from the group and is living by himself since he almost lost his life hunting for Sophia. He seems resentful of everyone and aloof.<br /><br />A group is mobilizing to look for Rick and Hershel: Shane, Andrea, Daryl, Theodore. Dale doesn't trust Shane's intentions and tries to persuade Andrea that Shane is not a nice guy, but she trusts Shane. Andrea tells Dale that Shane has done more for the group than Rick, which shocks Dale. Before the group can get started, a red-and-white pickup roars into camp, carrying Rick, Glenn, Hershel, and the new guy from the rival group, Randall. Hershel fixes Randall's leg and says he should be healed enough in a week. Rick wants to put Randall on the main highway with a canteen of water in a week. Andrea thinks that is the same thing as leaving him for the walkers. A debate ensues over whether Randall is a threat. Rick says no one is going to come looking for Randall; that his gang left him for dead. Shane counters that Rick is \\"back in fantasyland\\" and says sarcastically that he is going to go get Randall some flowers and candy.<br /><br />Hershel steps forward and tells Shane that they haven't even dealt with what Shane did at Hershel's barn yet. Hesays that this is his farm and that he wanted them gone. Rick talked him out of it but that doesn't mean he has to like it. Hershel says that Shane should keep his mouth shut. Andrea follows Shane out.<br /><br />It is clear that Andrea is a soldier for Shane, willing to do whatever Shane wants. She conspires with Shane about Randall: \\"If he finds his people and leads them here, we'll have a war on our hands,\\" Andrea says to Shane. \\"You're preaching to the choir, girl,\\" Shane says to her. Shane tells Andrea that Rick and Hershel are dangerous: \\"They want to play house and they are bound to get us all killed.\\" Andrea responds, \\"Then we have to stop that.\\"<br /><br />Lori tells Rick that Shane thinks the baby is his. She says to Rick, \\"No matter what, it's yours.\\" Rick accepts this and says Shane will too. Lori warns Rick that Shane is delusional and dangerous. She says that when Shane came looking for her, that he lied to her. Rick says, of course he did. Lori is upset about what he did at the barn. She says he has threatened Dale and Hershel, and that he is scaring people and scaring her. Lori thinks Shane killed Otis. Loris tells Rick she thinks Shane did it not just to save Carl but because Shane loves Lori and he thinks they are supposed to be together. No matter what. Rick says, but you don't know that.<br /><br />Rick tells Lori he killed two people today because of Lori and the baby. It was Lori and the baby. No matter what. Lori warns Rick that Shane is not to be trusted. She says, \\"You killed the living to protect what's yours?\\" Rick says, \\"That's right.\\" She says, \\"Shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the baby is his. And he says you can't protect us. That you're gonna get us killed. He's dangerous, Rick, and he won't stop.\\"<br /><br />The camera zooms in on Rick's enraged face.

030758836X|2.0|The first 90% of the book is well written and captivating, you are completely sucked in and as the book draws to a close you might start to panic a bit, where's the ending and then it's done.  There is no ending or rather it is a very very poor one.  The other issue with the book is that none of the characters are likable, well maybe Go Nick's sister but other than that there is no one to like in this book.

B007NZDES0|5.0|I saw the \\"extravaganza\\" in person and relived every minute of it again via this DVD. Truly outstanding. Not a concert, an event.
B005FISBTO|2.0|I have been a huge Dexter fan since the first season.  Loved this show, and couldn't wait for each successive new season to come out on DVD.  But this season?  So boring.  Oh, wait.  Not boring.  BORING!!!<br /><br />First and foremost, the killing duo of Edward James Olmos and Colin Hanks absolutely put me to sleep.  The dullest murderous duo ever.  For a show that has created some of the most fascinating psychopaths in the history of television/movies, this pairing, and the accompanying writing, were shockingly bad.  Neither of the actors scared me in the least.  Not for one moment did either of them seem believable as a killer.  Colin Hanks in particular.  It was embarrassing to watch him try so hard and so unsuccessfully to be a convincing bad guy.  He simply pouted a lot, like a petulant little boy.  Who on earth was responsible for that casting?  And there was no consistency to his character.  He was ridiculously wishy-washy.  And even after the \\"twist\\" was revealed, and the wishy-washiness made at least a small bit of sense, that didn't change the fact that all of the preceding episodes were deadly dull.<br /><br />The whole over-arching religion theme of the season was incredibly heavy-handed, ridiculously smack-you-in-the-face.  A theme should play out naturally and subtlely in a story.  It shouldn't be clunkily imposed on every last facet.<br /><br />I understand that a show must keep changing (and hopefully evolving), but the whole (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Debra in love with Dexter idea was ridiculous.  That is the sort of idea that a dying show uses (unsuccessfully) to create shock and drama.<br /><br />I also agree with numerous other reviewers about the ads for other shows, as well as for the next season of Dexter, that you can't forward past.  And yes, especially the fact that the very last (shocking?) seconds of Season 6 are shown in a preview for Season 7.  Truly unbelievable.
B001F12J0C|5.0|The best trilogy yet, I cant wait for the 4th to come out on DVD. The new one looks to be the best yet, just wish it had Matt Damon in it.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|First, let me state, that I'm not a native English speaker (reader in this case), so it was sometimes very hard for me to get into the fine details of this book, as it is an extremely hard read sometimes. As I see, even native speakers have their share of problems with it. However, despite of these difficulties, I could not put the book down, and I think this says something. I did not care for translations of unknown words or phrases (I usually don't), if the book gets you hooked without them, it's a good book.<br />It is multi layered, but the fine prints are very hard to make out, you probably have to read it at least twice, to start seeing them. Others have said many things about the plot, so I won't. To surmise: this book clouds your mind. :)
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Not much to say really, the music speaks for itself.  The Music is incredible, the lyrics through the tracks remind me a bit of Voltaire's book \\"Candide.\\"  This album is for men (and women) who want complexity and thought in music.
B0085776BG|3.0|I was very satisfied with the special effects of the film. The quality of the film was excellent. It could not have been any better if I were watching this film in a theater.I believe the story line was predictable.  Thank you for finally giving respect to these brave Americans.I know there was plenty of racism in America that was publically displayed during this time. I also think the film did not really touch the true character of racism in America. It only took 60 years to bring this film to Americans when these bave men sacrificed their lives for their country. Shame on America for treating these people as 2nd class citizens.
6305252572|3.0|The bargain-rack movie for last night was \\"48 Hours\\" starring Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. Alas, it was not one of my better picks. Nolte played one of those \\"tough guy\\" cops, you know, one of those guys who doesn't look like a cop, has a really foul mouth, doesn't follow any of the rules and proceedures and doesn't seem to answer to anyone. I guess he was supposed to be some type of Dirty Harry, but he's nowhere nearly as good. Anyway, Nolte had need to find some really bad dude and the only way was to enlist a former bad-dude associate (Murphy), now serving a prison sentence. Nolte got Murphy released for 48 hours in order to carry out their search, and the two formed an uneasy alliance (one a cop, one a convict) in order to accomplish the task. It's mildly amusing, especially the part played by Murphy, as you might expect. In general, it's poor acting, a weak script, outrageously poor driving (but a bit funny) and lots of action. Yaawwwnnnn!<br /><br />\\"48 Hours\\" was fairly well produced and moved along at a brisk pace through a range of interesting San Francisco environments. Some of the underground music was quite enjoyable. Nothing about the story seemed believable, but I'd guess it was meant to be more of a comedy than a meaningful story, so it's off the hook on that one. But, if it was a comedy, it wasn't a very good one. It's just ho-hum, a two hour filler for someone that has nothing better to do. No doubt, someone will think it's the best movie he or she has ever seen.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0070Y46UY|5.0|How do you rate a book when you really hated it, but it has nothing to do with the writing or the story? (Which are really good).<br /><br />I battled with myself throughout this book to keep reading. It truly shook me, and that is why I gave it 5 stars. It was a very intense experience, that I still remember now, several years later.<br /><br />This book tells you about the survival of a young indian boy, named Pi, onboard a life-boat filled with zoo animals (yes, there is a tiger, as you can see on the cover).<br /><br />Now, why did I hate it? (spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The reviews on the cover promised \\"an uplifting experience\\", and \\"regaining belief in the human spirit\\".<br /><br />I was a little down at that time and thought, \\"hey, this sounds like just the book for me!\\"<br />Boy, was I stupid..<br /><br />[spoiler]<br />I was shocked and horrified to read about the slaughter of the animals onboard the life-boat (probably has to do with me being a vegetarian. Note to self: what did you think would happen with a tiger onboard?!). And it just kept going on-and-on-and-on. The fact that (major spoiler ahead) it was actually people who got slaughtered, and not animals, made it even worse.[end of spoiler]<br /><br />The lesson I took from this book is: I'm not a survivor at all cost. In some situations I'd rather die, than live through the horrors. (Which makes me appreciate my grandparents even more)<br /><br />So if you are not squeamish, aren't horrified easily, or all of the aforementioned, but looking for an unusual experience, go read this book!
B007XH6BPG|5.0|Smooth, melodic, harmonic, mellow.  One could argue the music has the sounds of yesteryear... but there is definitely something more... there is heaviness to it, not to mention talent.  Its refreshing to listen to some prog of \\"prog\\" rock.

B00007GZQZ|4.0|My bargain-bin movie for last night was \\"The Money Pit\\" starring Tom Hanks and Shelly Long. It was kinda funny, but plays on some dreaded fears faced by adult homeowners operating on a limited budget. Let's say you just bought your first home. It was an older model, but you got it for a good price (a steal). Then as you're moving in everything starts going wrong and needs repairs. Well, you know how hard it is to get repairs and how expensive. Then, after long delays, all the various repairmen show up at the same time. Well, almost any homeowner has experienced that sort of thing. Well multiply your experience by an order of magnitude and you have the basic plot of \\"The Money Pit.\\"<br /><br />Hanks and Long play a pair of NYC lovers living in her ex-husband's vacant apartment while he is living in Europe. Well, he unexpectedly shows up so our pair are out house-hunting in the New York City area. They find an out-in-the-country, million-dollar mansion, on emergency sale for only $200K. They can't believe their good fortune and buy it with only a cursory examination. Well, what do you think follows? This mansion starts to fall apart in ways you couldn't even imagine. Everything collapses, goes up in smoke or runs over. It's almost painful for a home owner to watch. And with every little thing, you can see the dollar signs multiplying out of control. It is, indeed, a money pit! Then there are the repairs. Of course, nobody is immediately available and they all need up-front bucks to even think about fixing anything. Meanwhile, our couple is forced to live in their newly-acquired trash heap. Then to cap it all off, about a dozen different repair crews all show up on essentially the same day and the the whole fiasco turns into complete chaos. Naturally, the stress level gets so high that the couple splits, at least temporarily.<br /><br />Now, do you find this to be funny? Well, just look over some of the five-star reviews and some reviewers think this is the funniest thing they've ever seen in their lives. My guess would be that these are apartment dwellers who have never even owned a home or carried a large mortgage. Personally, I got a few good laughs out of the movie, but I wouldn't go so far as to say these people's tragedy was hilarious. That's just not my idea of humor. In any case, the movie was well done and the acting was good, if somewhat painful to watch.<br /><br />Gary Petersoning they've ever seen in their lives.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|What a cool little product!  With two AAA batteries in, it fits snugly in the input jack of my Fender Strat, and delivers a wicked hi-gain distortion.  The line-in feature is great so you can play along with using your computer headphone jack, an iPod, or a drum machine.  While the tone dynamics don't provide too wide a range, I'm very happy that I can get enough tonal difference to play screechy solid-state stuff like old US hardcore to current metal.  I used to have a Marshal MicroStack, but immediately put it up on Craigslist when this thing came in the mail.  Very happy with the purchase.
1439116881|5.0|This book brought tears and smiles..I have a history of Altzhiemer's in my family. My Mother,my Uncle[her brother], my brother and at this time, my sister is in the final stages. The book let  me cry as well as laugh. I read it as a borrowed book from my friend. It was so moving, I had to get a copy for myself.
B006886AN4|5.0|For those who are WWII buffs or those just interested in learning more about the Pacific theater, this series is absolutely incredible (albeit taking mature content into account). This is just as good the it's sister series, Band of Brothers, which in my opinion set the standard for war docu-dramas. This series is one of the most accurate portrayals of the experiences of those who fought in the PTO, and just how brutal and unforgiving the combat and environment was there. I'm not really sure if people anymore really understand just how brutal the PTO was for the everyday Marine on the ground since most of the time people are taught about ETO more so than the PTO, well, other than the dropping of the A-bombs. The Marines in the PTO faced unforgiving terrain and an unforgiving and proud enemy, and this series clearly and graphically brings this to life.<br /><br />Sometime ago I watched Ken Burn's documentary \\"The War\\" again (which is a phenomenal series in of itself), and so many of the individuals discussed in that documentary are characters in this series. For me personally, knowing the history and stories from Burn's documentary made this series and the characters all of the more real for me. For those into Ken Burn's stuff, I would watch \\"The War\\" and then watch this series, and I believe you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The music score is incredible and powerful. The acting is very well done.<br /><br />I very highly recommend this series.

0375507256|5.0|It's been months since I have written a review.  In truth, I thought I was done with writing reviews on Amazon and Goodreads, but Cloud Atlas is such a special book that I had to come back.<br /><br />The thing that makes Cloud Atlas so incredibly impressive is that is a first-person narrative told through several first persons.  Let me put this another way.  Cloud Atlas is not so much a single novel as it is six novellas, each told from the perspective of a major participant, each period piece from a different moment in history.  What the reader discovers is that all of these stories and voices are as intricately related as the notes of a fine symphony.<br /><br />The book begins with the journal of Adam Ewing, an American who stumbles through a chain of small islands off New Zealand in the 1850s.  Ewing is by all indications, a good man, though perhaps not entirely courageous who lands himself in dangerous straits with the captain and crew of the ship he is traveling on.<br /><br />Ewing does not finish telling his tale of his dangerous voyage, at least not in the first half of the book.  In fact, he stops in mid-sentence.<br /><br />This is where Cloud Atlas is both brilliant and cunningly frustrating.  You see, just as the reader begins to understand just how much trouble Adam Ewing is in, the novel abandons him and takes up the letters of Robert Frobisher, a scoundrel and a fop who has been excommunicated from his fabulously well-to-do family and burned through every penny he owns.<br /><br />Having burned every bridge he has in his own native England, Frobisher leaves for Belgium where he hopes to dupe an aging composer into hiring him as an apprentice.  A talented musician, Frobisher hopes to steal the old goats work and publish it under his own name.<br /><br />Once he has ingratiated himself with the old man, Frobisher begins skulking around the house and sizing up other pilfering.  It is during this time that Frobisher discovers Adam Ewing's journal... well, half of Ewing's journal.  He reads the half that he can find, becomes engrossed, and then to his displeasure, discovers that the second half is missing.<br /><br />Frobisher relates his story through a series of letters to Rufus Sixsmith, whom the reader never meets during Frobisher's time.  Just as Frobisher weaves his way into the sweet old composer's good graces, the reader is whisked away to California, circa 1975, and another story--that of a young reporter names Luisa Rey.<br /><br />Luisa lives in the same building as a very old man named Rufus Sixsmith... yes, the very same Rufus Sixsmith who received long letters from the incorrigible Robert Frobisher.  Luisa is the daughter of a distinguished Vietnam-era reporter.  She would like to write heavy-hitting investigations as well; but, unfortunately she's been relegated to gossip and celebrity-style stories instead.  That changes when Sixsmith, now a famed scientist, tells her about underhanded dealings at a soon-to-open nuclear power plant.<br /><br />While working on the story, Luisa Rey gets her hands on the Frobisher letters, which she finds remarkable.  She does not have a lot of time to read them, however, as she finds herself in over her head on her new story.<br /><br />And here, once again, Cloud Atlas, abandons an excellent storyline and takes up a new one.  In this case, it is the story of Timothy Cavendish, a schmuck of the Robert Frobisher variety who publishes books.  Cavendish Books is a vanity press--a company that publishes the unpublishable for a price.<br /><br />As this story begins, we learn that the aging Cavendish has printed a book called Knuckle Sandwich, which is basically the life story and musings of a London thug.  The book is visceral though not beautifully written.  It might well have gone unnoticed had its author, very much a thug, not thrown the only critic to review the book from a skyscraper during a cocktail party.  Suddenly, the thug is in jail for a very public murder and Knuckle Sandwich is the book on everybody's list.<br /><br />Thinking he is free and clear, Cavendish spends the profits only to discover that the thug has three equally thuggish brothers who want their share.  It is while Cavendish is on the run that he  looks through a titled A Luisa Rey Mystery.<br /><br />And now we jump to the future and Sonmi-451--a clone created in the world of Nea So Copros, which is the Korea of the future.  In Nea So Copros, clones are created to work menial jobs that are seen as beneath the dignity of real people.  Other clones are fed drugs and kept in a in a mental haze, but Sonmi-451 manages to transcend her station, becoming sentient and therefore is perceived as a threat to the social order.<br /><br />By the time the reader meets Sonmi-451, she is captured and scheduled for execution.  We hear her story as she relates it to an \\"archivist\\" who has been assigned to preserve this piece of history.<br /><br />While all of the storylines in Cloud Atlas are strong, this one was probably my favorite.  The Sonmi-451 story is compelling and unique.  It is Flowers For Algernon without the regression.  It is redemptive.  Like A Clockwork Orange, it has its own language; and like Anghony Burgess, Mitchell is able to teach the reader his made-up idiom as the story goes.  Very, very impressive work.<br /><br />The Sonmi-451 story is inter-related to the Cavendish story.  During her ascension, she sees a forbidden \\"disney\\" titled \\"The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish.\\"<br /><br />And the last character on the Cloud Atlas-card, a post-apocalyptic tribesman in Hawaii named Zachry sees Sonmi-451 in a movie as well--a holographic movie very reminiscent of R2D2 showing Han Solo the video of Princess Leia.  Zachry is a young goat herder in dystopian Hawaii, an island with peaceful valley men trying to co-exist with ferocious tribesmen called the \\"Kona.\\"<br /><br />Zachry's life is disrupted when Meronym, a sort of futuristic Jane Goodall, comes to live with him and his family while observing his primitive tribe.  This was my least favor section of the book.  Like Sonmi-451, whom Zachry's tribe worships as a goddess, Zachry speaks in a language that is largely different than English.  It is sort of a patoi of Jamaican lingo and Hawaii's native pidgin.  The story is good and the writing is fine.  Being the least interesting segment in Cloud Atlas still qualifies this story as well worth the read.<br /><br />David Mitchell manages to conjure six fascinating worlds, all well researched and described, all populated by fascinating characters.<br /><br />This book is a remarkable achievement.d Knuckle Sandwich is the book on everybody's list.<br /><br />Thinking he is free and clear, Cavendish spends the profits only to discover that the thug has three equally thuggish brothers who want their share.

B007SGM084|4.0|Well, to be honest, I don't quite know what I was expecting my self. I did however wanted to know, what was all the hipe about? Sometimes I found the author very repetitive. (don't understant why editors wouldn't do something about it). Also I found myself skipping through some pages(did go back though, and made myself read it, and don't reget that I did).The essence of the story however, is lovely, and I intstantly fell in love with the characters. Intersted to see how producers and writers will adapt this book into a movie, and I really hope they will not make it a PG-13!!! It is not a book for minors. **SPOILER** At the end  of Fifty Shades Freed, we got to pick a little bit into Christian's mind and his side of the story, and honestly can not wait to read it. I really hope E L James gift us that joy.<br />I will recomend this book to friends, very open minded friends...

0439023521|4.0|I was one of the early 2010 readers, by chance. I was in the middle of writing the first book in my dystopian series; [[ASIN:B005G4PUAK INVASION USA (Book 1) - The End of Modern Civilization]] when I needed a break and picked up my daughter's latest read.<br /><br />I was writing fiction about what could happen during and after a possible apocalyptic attack by China on the USA, The Hunger Games described what might happen after an apocalyptic event, and held my attention. I enjoyed the book tremendously, and reading it refreshed me to continue my own series.<br /><br />I looked forward to the rest of the series of The Hunger Games, and life carried on until last weekend.<br /><br />My son purchased the blueray DVD of the first Hunger Games movie I had read 2 years earlier, and brought it home for us to view. The movie was just as good as the book, brought the mental memories back to life for me, and I found the parts filmed in North Carolina a real plus; living so close to where much of the film was made.<br /><br />Which is better first?<br />I'm glad I read the book first. The movie was great, changed my mental pictures of the story, but the visuals walked \\"hand-in-hand\\" with the reading memories I had formed two years earlier. The movie did want me to take more interest in the series though. I first thought The Hunger Games was for \\"Young Adult\\", but found the story to be for us male Boomers as well.<br /><br />Recomendation: Read and then view!

B007HJHO2O|5.0|I am eternally on a hunt for awesome modern prog that builds on, rather than re-creates, classic prog. Rarely do I come across music that fits that bill to a tee. Examples for me include Frost*, Porcupine Tree, Mute Math, OSI, Riverside, Pure Reason Revolution etc. These guys have an awesome vocalist (one of the best voices in prog IMO), diverse instrumentation, chops, rhythmic and melodic complexity, the works. They need a leg up! Buy their swag!

B008E374PO|3.0|This album isn't very good. I say that as someone who listens to Owl City more than any other artist. Adam Young is my favourite artist, whether it's under Owl City, Sky Sailing, Port Blue, or Insect Airport. But this...this album just feels lazy. It feels like either the label pressured him into being more radio-friendly or he went for a more 'mainstream' sound and churned out some generic pop tracks. There are a few stand-out songs (Shooting Star, Dementia, Embers, Silhouette), but other than those it's really disappointing. The worst part is the lyrics...his work usually sounds like some kind of abstract poetry, but this sounds like every song I've heard on the radio in the past few years.<br /><br />I tried to like it, I really did, but it's a huge disappointment. Hopefully album number five will be better.

1439127700|5.0|My wife and I visited the Reagan Library and the Nixon Library this summer. My younger brother gave me a copy of \\"The Presdidents Club\\" as a Father's Day gift. Coincidence? We don't think so. This is a very accessible book about a most exclusive club. At its largest there have been only six members in it at any one time. This book reads more like a novel than a work of fiction. It's difficult to put down at times. It's a recommended read with the presidential election just days away.
0307474259|5.0|I read Why We Get Fat about a month ago.  Have followed the diet as close as I can given the summer cookouts etc.  Am down about 10 pounds, eat whenever I get hungry.  Don't miss the carbos.  Feal good to have control of my weight for a change.  Highly recommend the book to everyone who ask me about loosing weight.
0061564893|5.0|This is a book that's going on my shelves for future rereads. The book is at its best when discussing all the fascinating things the Chinese fleet did, and at its weakest--which isn't very weak at all--when forced to go back to discussing the usual European explorers again. (This may be purely a matter of taste on my part; it's just not very interesting to read about Columbus again, when I could be reading about a massive Chinese treasure fleet.)<br /><br />The amount of evidence the author's pulled together, especially in the revised edition, is enough to justify the occasional irritation that shines through when the author discusses people who want to discount his entire book on account of a few pieces of less convincing evidence. And he's throughout he specifies what evidence is more or less solid; the vast majority is convincing, to the point that by a quarter of the way in I was beginning to wonder why I'd never heard about any of this before.<br /><br />All told, a deeply enjoyable and easy to follow book, which has convinced me to go out and track down more Chinese history to complement it.

B0084I9QIW|4.0|They should release the 1st leg of Yokohama's concert on DVD.  There are a lot of DVDs out there of Yokohama concert with horrible sound. Why not invest in a studio like they did with the Wembley concert and bring true 5.1 surround sound to the Yokohama's concert as well? It does no justice to the legacy of Michael Jackson by not giving the fans the best experience possible and see what make the man GREAT. And there is no such thing as too many releases when it come to Michael Jackson.  People just can't get enough of his performances. I am surprise the man never EVER got a TRUE official DVD release of his BAD concert EVER until now.  And we're talking about the King of POP who are known all over the world and yet not a single official DVD disc to capture the moment of his greatness during the Bad era?? The moment of what makes the man so great!! Even Bruce Lee got a lot of his films on DVDs. If you say...oh because there is no DVD format during the 80s....but hey Bruce Lee's films were never meant to be in DVD format to begin with.  And if you make other excuses like....oh because MJ's Bad concerts were not captured on films? Huh?? You got to be kidding me right? The man traveled all over the world doing the Bad concerts in different countries.  Surely, television were invented back then right?? And sure, they were captured on films. How can he went all over the world and only Japan being the only country captured his greatness on film? It doesn't add up.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Okay, so i just received the Wembley's Concert DVD today and just finished watching it.  Here's my honest review of the DVD. Before I do, let me just say that I have seen the Yokohama DVD, the Brisbane and the various clips of the BAD concerts here and there and i know that none of them are DVD quality. They were not meant to be DVD quality. But at the same time, they're not HIGH-QUALITY either.  I am a bit disappointed with all of the DVD releases so far of Michael Jackson's BAD concerts...and YES that include Michael Jackson's Wembley.  Sure, it's a tag better than the other DVDs in term of overall presentation...but it's just \\"a tag\\" better.  In other words, in a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being blue ray and 9 being DVD quality, Wembley fall somewhere around 4 or 5. The Yokohama BAD concert is visually slightly better than Wembley but c'mon it doesn't make much of a difference really...both are bad VHS quality visually. The Wembley's visual looks like its paint washed out even watching it in 4:3. It is definitely watchable but you just wish the visual is crisp and rich and golden like MJ's performance on stage but it's just not there.  Now i know why they don't put the Yokohama on DVD as well.  It really doesn't matter.  When the source of the visual are bad, it doesn't matter if you put it on DVD or not, it won't help that much.<br /><br />Update on visual:  Okay, watching it on PC with the TotalMediaTheatre5 software, i can make adjustment and bring the visual quality up a notch. So instead of rating it 4 or 5 out of 10, I am giving it a 6/10. This is for watching it on PC. If you watch it on external system like Xbox 360 or PS3, the visual will go down a notch.<br /><br />As far as overall performance of MJ, when it started out the first half or so of the songs, i say to myself, it's nothing i didn't see before in Yokohama.  But in the 2nd half, his performance getting more intense with incredible move after move from the Smooth Criminal all the way to the BAD performance.  His dancing is so much fluid. He just couldn't stop dancing.  Even when the show ended and he started giving credit to his casts, it is a treat to see him continue dancing along.  That in itself is incredible, better than Yokohama's ending.  Smooth Criminal (although not in Yokohama) is incredible...so is Thriller (definitely better than Yokohama and I love the beat). Beat It is alright.  Billie Jean (i think the ending of Billie Jean is better than Yokohama as he does more moves with more gracefulness).  Bad is also a must-see same like Yokohama!<br /><br />As far as the sound go...it is okay, a bit better than Yokohama.  I have the Harman/Kardon sound system and when i play music videos off of my PC, the sound w/ the bass is INCREDIBLE.  I don't feel the same with the Wembley's concert.  Like the visual, I feel the sound is in the same rating.<br /><br />UPDATE ON SOUND QUALITY: Okay, i watched this on my PC and the sound and visual can be adjusted, and the sound is pretty darn good i must say w/ the bass adjusted.  So it's just a matter of what kind of software and hardware you have in order to take advantage of this gem. I use TotalMediaTheatre5 software.<br /><br />So my conclusion is this.  Since the performance and the sound are incredible than the Yokohama's DVD, I will say this is the best release TO DATE of ANY MJ's Bad Concert! But better in terms of what?? In a scale of 1-10, it doesn't even meet the high-quality standard...let alone DVD quality.  If you don't mind of the visual and just want to experience an MJ's concert in a VHS format, get this (try watching it on PC).  If you never seen a Michael Jackson's concert in your life, you will be blown away.<br /><br />I definitely want to own this DVD because MJ's performance is incredible and i forgot to mention...I really REALLY like the video angle capture of MJ in this concert than the one in Yokohama because you can see MJ's full view close up in all his glory.  That's why i wish they find the UMATIC version and restore the visual because it is such a treat to see MJ perform this incredible yet the visual didn't meet the standard.
B007SGM084|4.0|LOVED these three books. These books were an easy, fun, erotic read. I have read a lot of people critisizing how poorly these books are written, and I defintely do not agree. Are these books a deep, intellectual read? Defintely not! Are these books a fun read, allowing women to explore sexuality and erotic fantasy? Defintely Yes! Don't take these books to seriously, read them and enjoy them. I sure did!!!
B006M9NJFG|4.0|GOOD:  It hold water and it is appears well made.  I will update after one year of use.<br /><br />BAD:  Wish that there was a place to store water tabs with a cover, like a military canteen.  I'm all about have equipment on your person in the event of an emergency.<br /><br />UGLY:  Good product.<br /><br />RECOMMEND:  Yes
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved the 50 Shades of gray books! I just wish there was more. Now I don't know what to read.. I was suprised that it wasnt as dirty as everyone had made it out to be. Yes it was dirty but not bad, It sheads a little light on the \\"other things\\" people do behind closed doors.. Very fast easy reads..
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I saw this book stacked out the front of several bookshops but didn't know what it was until I read a review in a magazine. It sounded interesting so I downloaded it onto my Kindle and with great anticipation started reading. Unfortunately with most things that come with expectations and a whole lot of hype, I found it very disappointing and left wondering what all the fuss was about. It features a very good looking and very rich business man and an immature university student just about to graduate who just happens to be a virgin, that in itself is a bit hard to believe. They meet and he feels and attraction to her as she to him and after several meetings he whisks her away to his apartment in his private helicopter. She is happy to surrender her virginity to him in a romantic, loving way but the words 'romance' and 'loving' don't enter into his vocabulary. Eventually he takes her to his play room that sports every kind of dominetrix toy and tool you can imagine and of course she is shocked and amazed that someone as nice as him could be into that sort of thing but intrigued at the same time. At this point I was losing interest but kept going thinking any minute now it was going to grab me but alas, it didn't. I now realise it's part of a trilogy but I'm unsure if that would have made any difference. It is well written and if you like this sort of book then you'll enjoy but as for me, I'm sorry Mr James but it's back to action thrillers for me!

B0034G4P26|3.0|Pirates have become cool again with the trilogy of films made by Johnny Depp but those films might be just a tad too intense for the youngest of children. With that in mind the folks at Aardman studios, the stop motion group responsible for Wallace and Gromitt among other things, have come up with some pirates of their own. They've just been unleashed with this film.<br /><br />The story follows a group of pirates that aren't quite up to snuff in the pirate hierarchy. Sure they have the peg legs and eye patches, but this ragtag group just doesn't seem to pillage near as much as most. They're led by the Pirate Captain who does his best to keep his crew happy and content (hey, don't forget ham night!). But Pirate Captain has dreams of his own, of becoming the Pirate of the Year.<br /><br />The only problem is the amount of pirating he and his crew does. With Cutlass Liz and Black Bellamy always bringing in more booty they win the competition every year. Rather than allow him the chance to do better, the group always ridicules him as well.<br /><br />That could all change when Captain Pirate and his crew board a boat stocked with all sorts of stuffed animals and body parts. The boat belongs to Charles Darwin who's been seeking a special scientific discovery so that he can become the Scientist of the Year award back in London. He too has had a tuff time but when he sees Captain Pirate's parrot he recognizes it is not a parrot at all but the extinct dodo bird. Darwin convinces Captain Pirate to take him to London along with the bird where they will win all sorts of treasures for their discovery.<br /><br />Even though the queen has placed a bounty on the heads of every pirate to sail the seven seas the group heads for London. Once there Darwin attempts to steal the bird from Captain Pirate to claim the award for himself. He fails and Captain Pirate wins the award, stunned to find that it isn't booty at all but an award along with the chance for time with, of all people, the Queen! Darwin failed to mention the reward would be time spent with the woman of his dreams.<br /><br />The Queen also wants possession of the dodo bird for her private zoo but Captain Pirate doesn't give in easily. After discovering he is a pirate and nearly decapitating him, she stops and pardons him in the hopes he will turn over the bird. When she offers treasure as well, Captain Pirate sees the chance to return to Blood Island with more booty than anyone has ever claimed and win the prized Pirate of the Year award. But all doesn't go as planned, something that always seems the case with this group.<br /><br />The story may seem pretty well straight forward but in truth there is more beneath the obvious here. It's not just about Captain Pirate winning the award and gaining some self esteem. Instead the story is more about discovering who you really are and what is really important in life. For Captain Pirate that boils down to winning the award he's cherished for so long or remaining true to both Polly (the dodo bird) and his crew.<br /><br />As with all Aardman Studio films this one is chock full of sight gags that run from beginning to end. Each one may be a small portion of the film seen but they all will garner laughs from adults as well as children. They do a nice combination of jokes that older viewers will get but won't offend the young crowd.<br /><br />The stop motion animation is as always amazing. In a world where computer animation seems to have taken over, it's nice to see someone using this technique and not allowing it to fade away. Somehow just watching it makes you realize how creative and artistic it is in comparison.<br /><br />The final word about this film though is that it is truly entertaining. It's a movie that both young and old will enjoy and have fun with. Topping that off is the fact that it offers something that youngsters will not realize they are getting and that is a set of morals to accompany the tale. They'll learn that wanting something and doing anything for it at the sake of losing everything that is truly important isn't quite worth it. And for a movie to entertain and get that point across is truly an amazing feat. So hoist the rigging and set sale for the high seas with this film that the whole family can enjoy.ing something and doing anything for it at the sake of losing everything that is truly important isn't quite worth it. And for a movie to entertain and get that point across is truly an amazing feat. So hoist the rigging and set sale for the high seas with this film that the whole family can enjoy.

Though, I am 70 years old and in good brain health, I now better understand what to do when I forget a word or forget what my next step is.  Basically, after reading Jill's book I simply have more patience and take more time to remember.  Works nicely and helps me slow my left brain fast and judgemental pacing. Her story is completely enticing and informative.  Watching her watch herself and experiencing her determination took me to another level of life's glorious journeys.

B0085A9J18|5.0|Have you ever watched a movie and afterwards thought to yourself \\"Man, I wish I had more time on my hands...I want to watch that movie all over again right now!\\" I can't say that I've experienced that feeling very often but I did after watching THE RAID: REDEMPTION. I didn't want to go to sleep, I wanted to do one of those college day deals where we stayed up all night and watched a movie over and over again.<br /><br />Filmed and taking place in Indonesia, the movie starts off with a young SWAT officer waking and preparing for his day. He says goodbye to his wife and tells his father something that feels ominous, as if we're missing what is going on. We later find this to be true.<br /><br />Once he meets the other SWAT team members they suit up and head out, being briefed on the way. Their goal is to take down the worst drug lord in Jakarta, a man who has holed up in a 30 story apartment building. Within the walls of the building the drug lord has regular paying tenants and some of the worst criminals in the country. They pay him to live there and aren't bothered by police. That's about to change as this SWAT team are about to enter the building with the goal of taking out the drug lord.<br /><br />But you know what they say about the best laid plans. While the head of the group gives them information about what to expect and who to look for, nothing could prepare them for the day's events. The two main sidekicks to the drug lord offer the brains and the brawn of his team. One is the thinker, a man who helps plan things out while the other, the smaller of the two (which seems odd until later), is the more ruthless member. Both will play an important part as the film progresses and one will have a secret that some may figure out before it is revealed.<br /><br />The SWAT team enters the building and has no problems at first that they can't handle. But as the reach the sixth floor things change when they are spotted and the signal is sent to the drug lord. Picking up his microphone he informs the tenants of his building via PA that they have \\"pests\\" in the building. Should anyone eliminate these \\"pests\\" he will grant them a free life time pass to stay in the building forever.<br /><br />What follows is a rampage of street thugs and martial arts masters all doing their best to take down the SWAT team.  Many are gunned down from the start while the others do their best to get out of the stairwell and into some form of cover. But the bullets fly and machetes are wielded with ease as the combatants try to take out this dedicated team.<br /><br />There are no words to describe the battle sequences these policemen find themselves in. The first amazing fight sequence takes place at about the 38 minute mark, a hand to hand combat scene that only lasts 2 minutes or so but that you'll find yourself rewinding to watch again. When I went back to watch sequences before writing this review that was the first spot I went to. It's followed by more sequences of amazing action and combat that first off is rare these days in action films more interested in chase scenes and secondly gives us a full view of the action rather than the close up shots seen in most action films these days. This movie captures the essence of action and never lets you go.<br /><br />When I watched this film I watched it with the subtitles on the screen (it was shot in Indonesia but directed by a Welsh director). Fortunately for those who aren't willing to go the subtitle route, the film is subbed in English. This brings up the fact that the film is indeed foreign. But that shouldn't stop anyone from watching this film, especially if you are an action fan.<br /><br />In looking back over the past year and the action films I've watched, I find it difficult to find another film that packs as much of a whollop as this film does. The only one that comes to mind is THE EXPENDABLES but that was released a year earlier. This is a movie that as an action film fan I wanted to make sure I had on my shelf. It's a film that I know I'll revisit from time to time. Looking at the behind the scenes moments offered in the special features I found it an even more amazing film to watch. Make a point of at least checking this movie out. As for me, I think I'll go fire up the DVD player and watch it one more time.e sure I had on my shelf.

B0084HJE0S|1.0|The book contains many glaring errors, such as claiming that AJAX was developed by Microsoft instead of Jesse James Garrett and his team at Google that was working on Google Maps.<br /><br />It claims that AJAX appeared when Netscape was still a dominant browser, but firefox had some place between five and ten times the use of Netscape when the term AJAX was first coined by Garret.<br /><br />The what's new in HTML 5 are mostly a comparison between xhtml and HTML 5 not HTML 4 and HTML 5.<br /><br />The discussion of flash is just weird, and misses some of the advantages of flash (color spaces that render colors the same cross platform) while overlooking the disadvantages (inability to bookmark a place in flash, unless programming tricks have been used)<br /><br />The book overstates the effect of the Mozilla project boot to gecko, as the issue of accessing camera's phone, and accelerometer is not one of can the browser do this, but how do you do it in a way that does not create an opening for malicious websites? That issue is one will be solved incrementally as best practices are slowly absorbed from native apps, just as happened with Geolocation that required a native application on the mobile device a few short years ago.<br /><br />Overall the book needs a fact checker and proofreader, and someone to go over the assumptions and story line once all the erroneous assumptions have been corrected.<br /><br />Hopefully the second edition will be grounded in reality.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|The movies from Alex Kendrick and his church just keep getting better. This movie grabs your attention right from the start with an action scene. Love the humor throughout the movie. The message is a much needed one today - for fathers to be courageous enough to take responsibility for their children. I like that they included a single father in the group.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|It would seem that making a movie based on a successful series of books would be an easy thing but that's not the case. To begin with there is the task of bringing the entire story that most would read over a period of say a week and turning it into a something that takes a little over 2 hours. Then there are the fans. When you have a book as popular as THE HUNGER GAMES, those fans can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Everyone has their favorite thing about the book they love and not all will make it to the final product. Fans that have yet to see the movie should know there are changes but that the movie is still wonderful.<br /><br />The story takes place in the future where after a tumultuous war the continent has been divided into districts. Each district is responsible for its own product which for the most part is taken to the Capitol. As a tribute and a reminder of their defeat by those in the Capitol a yearly competition is held called the Hunger Games. A boy and girl, ages 12-18, are selected from each district. They are wined, dined and trained for a few days then set free in an area designated for the games. The way to win is to kill the other 23 contestants.<br /><br />The focus of the story revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman who hunts illegally to keep her family fed and taken care of. This year is the first that her young sister Prim must enter her name. The odds are against her name being drawn but when it is, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the son of the local baker. The two are allowed their goodbyes to friends and family and then whisked away to the Capitol.<br /><br />On their train trip to the Capitol both Katniss and Peeta are given instruction from their two mentors. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) is the prim and proper example of what the Capitol is all about: excess in nearly every area and blindly obedient to the President (Donald Sutherland). Their other mentor, clearly the better of the two, is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). Haymitch is a past winner who has knowledge of the games first hand. He also drinks non-stop in an effort to get through the knowledge that perhaps these two might not make it home again.<br /><br />With the story set up we get to the Capitol and witness the transformation of Katniss and Peeta from backwoods teens whose names were drawn to contestants who must not only be physically fit but must win the favor of viewers and wealthy sponsors who can help them with gifts throughout the games. It is their best chance for survival but Katniss hates the games and what they represent. Still, several incidents occur that win her favor in some circles.<br /><br />The day arrives and the contestants are set free to do bodily harm to one another. Backpacks with special equipment are left for them to take if they can avoid being stabbed or worse by other contestants. As the person with the best skills and chance of surviving, Katniss sets out to find a way to win taking as few lives as possible. When the rules are changed to allow both competitors from each district survive as a team, she must find Peeta who proclaimed his love for her during a pre-game interview. Together they might have a chance to make it out of the Hunger Games alive.<br /><br />Movie fans of the film BATTLE ROYALE will raise a stink that this film has taken its idea from that one. Nothing could be further from the truth. While the battling teens are similar, the way the games are handled is much different. But more important is the story of Katniss who changes as she makes her way through the games. Cold and hard at first, she comes to find romance and a caring soul among those she fights next to and against. It is a coming of age story that shows a young woman forced to reach maturity beyond her years.<br /><br />The movie has a great look stretching from the coal mining scenes that form the world of District 12where Katniss is from to the over-glamorized appearance of the Capitol. These are two different worlds on the same planet and the reactions of Peeta and Katniss show that they've never seen anything outside their front door. It doesn't mean that they admire this new world; they just recognize it is different.<br /><br />The acting is straight forward here. No one seems to be hamming it up or overplaying their roles. Each one comes across as the person they are here to represent which would seem easier for lesser known actors and much more difficult for those who are seasoned professionals. All included in this film turn in admirable jobs.<br /><br />Knowing that the books are a trilogy one could be afraid that the end of this film would leave you hanging on the edge, waiting for the next. Don't be afraid. This movie would stand on its own if it had to. But once you become a fan my guess is you'll anxiously anticipate the next or perhaps you'll begin reading the books. In any event, THE HUNGER GAMES is a movie that will have you thinking, talking with friends and considering the implications. And more than anything it will entertain you.where Katniss is from to the over-glamorized appearance of the Capitol.

0439023521|4.0|The premise itself is fairly illogical -- if you want to keep a people from rising up against you, the VERY LAST thing you'd do is take their kids from them, because that is guaranteed to bring about the result (a major uprising) that the book keeps telling us the capitol wants to avoid. Other than that, a very fast and engaging read. We're talking Running Man for the tween and teen audience.

0142419400|4.0|This review comes directly from my blog \\"Justin's Book Blog\\"<br /><br />Actual Rating: 4 1/2 stars<br /><br />I can't even begin to explain how many times I had people telling me to read this book. And I would always just say that I'd get to it eventually. And now that I've actually read it, I don't see why I ever waited too. I have to admit it's one of the \\"Cuter\\" romance novels I've ever read. But that isn't a bad thing, I really enjoyed the cute aspect of the story. It made it a really light, and fun read.<br /><br />The two main characters in the story are absolutely amazing, Anna and Etienne (St. Clair) there is just something about them that I don't often see in many characters. The both had amazing characteristics, and both seemed like real people. A lot of the time, when it comes to characters in books lately they seem to be so unrealistic, but with these two it didn't seem that way at all. Granted there might be a few things that might be considered unrealistic by some, I think that as a whole they were amazing characters and each story line revolving around them, and even the story line about both of them was really well done. But there were also a lot of other really great characters in the book, my favorites had to of been Anna and St. Clair's group of friends from school. They all had their own unique personality, and just the way they all interacted together just made you feel like you were actually there listening to the conversations, or out at these different places around Paris with them, and not just reading about it on the page.<br /><br />As a whole, I thought the story was amazing. You have romance, angst, friendship and pretty much anything else you could imagine would play into a book like this. As a guy, most people might expect me to shy away from a book like this, because it is really cute and it's a romance story. But I loved it, I have read several other romance books before this one, and I have to say I enjoyed this one more than some of the others. I honestly don't know any other way to describe this book than a extremely cute romance. So if that's something you enjoy, this is a book for you.<br /><br />The part of the book that brought my score down just a little, was the end. Don't get me wrong, I was pleased with it and I think it brought a great close to the story. It just felt extremely predictable, and I don't mean just what happens between some of the characters, I also included some of the smaller things into my decision to drop the rating to 4 1/2 stars. But even with that, this book is a beautiful romance story. It might not be something everyone will enjoy, but if you enjoy cute, fun romance stories you honestly can't go wrong with this book. I honestly can't wait to read Lola now, I've heard it's just as cute. If it can stand up to how amazing Anna is, I am sure I will enjoy it too.f the others.

If you want a good classic read in this venue, why not try LADY CHATTERLEY'S LOVER.<br />I was very disappointed in the writing style - if there even was one - and the erotic scenes did not play out well with the story-line and the ending (in the 3rd book).

I guess I have been just lucky when odering videos. I never knew about this region 2. I was so upset that I didn't even want to return the video. You people should only sell videos that are able to be watched on all dvd players it was a waste of my time and money. I am not sure if I will buy videos from amazon again or not and I was a very faithful customer.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|My wife and I tried watching a movie on my phone while travelling on a plane. I had a passive splitter and we found that with two headphones plugged in, the phone didn't have enough power to drive both to sufficient levels so that we could hear over the ambient noise. We had to share one bud each from a single headset.<br />Did some research and found this - decided to give it a try.<br />It's awesome! Not only could we each have our own stereo headsets, but we didn't have to drive the phone's audio on max, saving precious battery. We bring it everywhere we travel!
1439102430|5.0|In Montreal, Amy Roberts arrives at the Honore Mercier ER suffering from vagina bleeding.  Dr. Kutchemeshgi realizes the disoriented woman recently gave birth, but is distracted by an influx of victims from a car pile-up.  Amy leaves.  Kutchemeshgi calls Surete du Quebec.  Homicide Lieutenant Detective Andrew Ryan goes to the address Roberts gave to the hospital.  She had used the name Alma Rogers at the apartment house, but is obviously gone.  With forensic anthologist Temperance Brennan and several cops they search for proof of the baby.  They find the remains of one in the bath; a second decomposed in the window seat and pepper the dog finds the third in a closet.  Ralph Trees arrives for paid sex with Alva Rodriguez who apparently fled to Edmonton.<br /><br />Joining Andrew and Tempe on the case is Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Ollie Hasty, who had a fling with the latter just after her divorce.  They head to Edmonton where they find a fourth newborn corpse.  The trio pursues the mother who heads to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories unprepared for what awaits them as diamonds are not a girl's best friend.<br /><br />The latest Temperance Brennan forensic police procedural (see Flash and Bones) is an exhilarating thriller in which the three investigators follow the horrible infanticide trail.  This case especially haunts Tempe whose son died at three from leukemia.  The relational triangle is a bit too coincidental, but adds tension to the storyline as the two men compete in different ways to claim Tempe who wishes both would tone down the testosterone.  Fast-paced from the onset, series fans will appreciate this chilling tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is probably more appropriate for young women in their 20's. I found the book quite poorly written (limited vocabulary) and boring actually. I am certain my opinion is by far in the minority but really not much of a page-turner for me. Sorry!
B004MKM8L8|5.0|I am a huge HP fan, and this movie definately lived up to the hype. Sure there are some things that are in the book that I feel should have been in the movie, but all in all it was a great movie.

B00014TJ7K|5.0|George Harrison's Cloud Nine took me back to 1987 with the hit songs; Got My Mind Set On You and When We Was Fab. I bought the CD used and it came to me in excellent condition like new. The sound quality is superb! George Harrison was one of the most talented and creative musicians of his time 1960's - 1980's. Although, he was the quiet Beatle, he was probably the most talented and creative of the fab 4. While part of the Beatles, George only sang a few of the songs while he played the guitar and John and Paul sang most of the Beatles songs.<br /><br />The Fab 4 were great together and great when they went their separate ways. George Harrison's creativity and talent really flows in his music and no one knew how gifted he was until the fab 4 split up and went their separate ways.<br /><br />My favorite George Harrison CD's in addition to Cloud Nine are: All Things Shall Pass and Living In The Material World. One of my favorite songs of all time is: My Sweet Lord

B005MYWZIO|5.0|I first heard Michael Kiwanuka while listening to a satellite radio station.  I was so impressed, that I wrote down his name and looked him up on the  internet.  At last, someone so new, so clean and a pleasure to listen to.  He has his own style that refuses to be put into a \\"typical\\" category.  His voice is truly a gift.  To sum it up, he is freah and he takes you on a ride, vocally, that you simply never want to return from.  Love this artisit.
B008966SLM|4.0|Robert's new album was produced by Kevin Shirley (Joe Bonamassa, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes) in just two weeks but don't expect either raw blues or heavy rock. Robert does what he has always done, beautifully-crafted, laid-back soul blues but Shirley does add big band accompaniment on \\"I'll Always Remember You\\" and even strings to \\"I'm Done Cryin'\\". The songs are all written by Robert and the band (including long-time bassist Richard Cousins) except for a really good version of Bobby Parker's \\"Blues get off my shoulder\\", which fits right into Robert's style and has some nice piano from Jim Pugh in the background.<br /><br />The guitar and vocals from Robert are as tasteful and controlled as ever but on the final live track, Magic Sam's \\"You belong to me\\", the guitar has a bit more volume and bite and the vocals are rawer and more heartfelt, as on most of his live recordings. I don't really know why Robert can't get this kind of sound on his studio recordings. However, this is a very consistent set of songs (if possibly a bit safe) and I'd probably go for the funky \\"Fix this\\" as my favourite track, closely followed by the similar \\"Side dish\\" with its nice guitar solo. I also really liked the restrained ballad \\"Sadder days\\" which Robert sings beautifully.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a great game. My 4, 7 and 9 year old kids love it and so do I (28)! I would recommend it to all my friends and family.

B00846TTDG|5.0|This film was unexpected for me.  I expected a sanitized version of what goes on.  The film is gritty and bloody and very realistic.  The price paid for renting this film is not enough.  It is a reminder of what we take advantage of every time we take a breath.  God Bless these brave Warriors!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is excellent. Very well thought out story and no lag or anything. I still cannot figure out myself how certain people rated this bad because they couldn't figure it out? Give me a break! That's what type of game this is! If your really that slow go play bubble pop, but don't go rating the game bad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this ..so many games you could never get bored ..ill be playing forever...there are some I cant beat lol

B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in years.  The characters in this movie are fictitious only in the sense that they are not based on named individuals but the characters in this movie are people you know or maybe you'll even recognize shades of yourself.  The unhappy negative wife of 40 years who has grown so bitter after years in a loveless marriage that she can be nothing but negative - played so convincingly and heartbreakingly by Penelope Wilton.  The sweet and easy-going husband who clearly deserves happiness but has stayed in the loveless marriage out of a sense of loyalty even though his wife consistently treats him with disdain - played with such tenderness and vulnerability by Bill Nighy.  The recently widowed woman who is taking a chance on herself and the possibilies which may be waiting - played to perfection by the amazing Dame Judi Dench.  And several more characters played with such depth and humanity by Dame Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Dev Patel, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup.  This is a movie worth watching and if it moves you even a bit as much as it has me - worth owning.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|This is the best Shinedown music CD, but then I said that about their last one too.  I like the lyrics and the music. Great music to listen to or work out to. Love it.

B001AEF6D6|5.0|We've been looking for this movie for quite some time. So glad we found it here and for such a great price!
0385335997|5.0|I especially enjoyed this third volume in the series.  The action seems unrelenting at times. So much happens; it seems the characters never enjoy a moment of calm or peace. Some of the twists and turns in the narrative were unexpected and greatly change the direction of the plot. As always, it is greatly entertaining, informative, and romantic. I just started the next book and look forward to seeing what develops. I love these characters. Lately, I find my thoughts taking on a Scottish accent.<br />Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel \\"To Be Chosen\\"
B004A8ZWWO|3.0|Heist movies remain popular, whether they are of the first class stature of `Topkapi, or the blend of intrigue and romance as in `The Thomas Crown Affair' original version, or the `007' variations.  Now we have a comedy version and the script  (a group recipe effort by Ted Griffin, Jeff Nathanson, Adam Cooper and Bill Collage) borders on the weak side, depending on a huge cast of well-known actors to pull it off.  Everyone tries, but despite some good moments the effort is thwarted by too many sidebars getting in the way of the momentum.<br /><br />Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the manager of a residential apartment in New York. He is close to all the tenants, especially Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), a financier. As it happens, Shaw is arrested by the FBI for fraud. Josh thinks it's a misunderstanding that can be resolved. But later he learns that the employees' pension which he asked Shaw to handle is gone. When one of the employees tries to kill himself, Josh's views of Shaw change. He goes to see him and loses his temper. He loses his job. The FBI agent (T&eacute;a Leoni) in charge of Shaw tells him that Shaw might walk and recovering the pension fund is unlikely. She tells him that it's been rumored that Shaw has 20 million laying around if he needs. Josh thinks he knows where it is. And that hatches the plot for pulling off the heist of a sophisticated Ferrari supposedly mad of gold) and Josh gathers the most obtuse group of people to pull of this heist: Eddie Murphy, Matthew Broderick, Casey Affleck, Stephen Henderson, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Gabourey Sidibe.  The outcome is predictable but it is the getting there that holds some funny lines, as we would expect from this groups of actors.<br /><br />No, it is not a great movie, but it has its entertaining moments and a very beautiful red Ferrari to hold our attention.  Decent summer movie experience. Grady Harp, August 12
B00005QCVY|5.0|hard to believe when it came out that it was not to popular now one of the most popular seasonal movies out there.  one of the special features is telling you the history of the movie.

Scott's great writing style, combined with his unbelieveble achievements, great race stories  and totally different approach to vegan (or as he's tought me: plant-based) food really had me reading with great enthousiasm from the first page to the last. I highly recommend reading this great book!<br /><br />Aart-Jan Hak<br />The Netherlands
B004XCUEXY|5.0|Being a fan of Foo Fighters I was eagerly looking forward to watching this documentary having seen bits and pieces on youtube. I was not disappointed. Honest and insightful, the makers captured the essence of who the Foo Fighters are and how and why they came to be one of the best Hard Rock bands in the music scene today.<br />A must for any fan or casual listener!!<br />5 Stars.
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|this is a great movie although i never read the graphic novel so i do not know how close to the story it is.  i like how they swerve the bullets.  this may not be for kids to watch.  10 out of 10.
0143123173|5.0|...better by a factor of 1000%.<br />The show is a treat. The books. ALL of the Craig Johnson's Absaroka County, Wyoming Sherrif Walt Longmire books are to a fresh read and fully fleshed character development what Veal Milanese with Fettucini Alfredo is to a satisfying Italian dinner. They are certainly worth the time and price. I have not been so satisfied with a new series in a very, VERY long time.<br />Everything (to my personal taste and selection) is as near to perfect as I could want.<br />Solid stories with a small hint hint of X-files and characters, ah,...those characters whom  I would not mind meeting; and sharing a drink of Pappy Van Winkle\\"s with IF they were real people.<br />Each and every one of these books has the corrrect feel and places a large dollop of respect for the readers.<br />Craig Johnson,.....\\"Um Humm. Yes. It is so\\".<br />I elected to omit an appropriate quote-comment from UnderSherrif Vic Moretti.<br />My Momma don't let me use such language.<br />Totally addicting novels. Get hooked.

B000VBIGD6|5.0|come on it has Chevy Chase in it is good.  Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo have the family to come over to there house for Christmas.  but every thing goes wrong.  one of the best parts of the whole movie is the sled riding part of the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Besides some grammatical and words correction a very good book. For does that don't like explicit sex scenes or to cross traditional normal boundaries this book is not for you. For does that believe life can change in a second and everything between to consenting adults is permitted your are welcome to read. This book is about self discovering and learning as it is about trust and sexual pleasure. Anastasia is a young women that haven't experience sex and encounter a young powerful man that has gone into the dark side of pleasure. Together they embark in a story that has intriguing twist and funny moments. Overall a great reading.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book is the best book I have read in a long time.  It is a very difficutlt read because of subject matter, but the book is riviting.  I loved it.  I have since read a few other books of this author and I highly recommend you check them out as well.

B008D28HYS|2.0|Good game, but will eat up the battery on my Bionic in the time it takes to solve 2 or 3 Level 2 puzzles - about 45 minutes.  A more graphics &amp; sound intensive game like Jetpack Joyride will last twice as long.<br /><br />A game like Crossme should use as little power as possible.  It's a disappointing trend in a lot of these simple game - the keep the cpu pegged at 100% for a game that xmcould run with headroom to spare on an Apple ][.  Devs, please pay more attention to power consumption.
030758836X|4.0|This novel had major hype and being #1 on the best seller list, I had high hopes to be entertained.  I had a hard time getting interested until I was half through the novel.  I was disappointed until then and have stopped at that point and will pick it up again in a few days.

B004LROMQG|5.0|The lump in the throat gets larger. You see more of what truly lies in the heart of Morgana and Uther is no help. The love between the future king- Arthur and a servant girl- Guinevere  is shown more as well as the deceit of Morgana and the wicked plans of her sister- Margos.  Merlin continues to fight evil in secret while becoming more powerful and Arthur shows how he truly might just make a good king. I also enjoyed the forming of the Knights of the Round Table. I can't wait until I receive season four.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Loved this movie. It's nice to watch a movie with more scenes added into it than watching it on tv.
B005F9TQ4C|4.0|This 1978 release may be seen as the book-end of Dylan's great creative wave in the 1970s ushered in with `Planet Waves' and including the seminal BoTT and the good but quirky `Desire' album. SL was Dylan's last `secular' album for some years, the 80s dominated by his exploration of Christianity and his more `white gospel' sound.<br /><br />SL is a generally upbeat album with some sing-along melodies (especially `Baby stop crying' and the opener `Changing of the Guards'), easy to `get' after only a couple of plays and definitive proof that Dylan always could write good tunes, not just great poetic lyrics. Dylan sings throughout the album with great power and gusto, like he really means it.<br /><br />Criticisms of the original 1978 release of SL focussed on the messy-sounding production, excessive use of backing vocals, overbearing intrusion of orchestra and horns and generally poor `finish' of the album's sound. In 1978 these criticisms had merit. However via various remastering efforts over the years, these issues have been much improved and the result is a good, if not quite a great Dylan album which nevertheless sits in the second rank of his epic canon of achievements. Dylan has always worked hard to resist being `pigeon-holed' and in common with his other work from the period, SL has its own unique character and sounds like nothing else he ever recorded.
B0049VZ222|5.0|this is one of the best shows relating to zombies i ever seen love the comics as well...i have got so many people to watch this show.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I've been a Leonard Cohen fan for many years, and it's frustrating when I mention him and hear, \\"Leonard who?\\" Most of the people I know don't even know about him, though I do share his music with people I think would appreciate it, and several of them have turned into fans. I love sooo many of his songs, but \\"10 New Songs\\" was my all-time favorite album. Now though, with \\"Old Ideas\\", I think it's a strong competitor for my favorite. His music is hard to describe because it doesn't really fit any genre. It's really unique. With this album I picture sitting in a smoky little uncrowded nightclub or bar, in the wee hours, with a nice buzz on, and just inhaling the languid, dreamy music. I don't claim to understand the lyrics of all the songs. But then, I don't think that's necessary. This music just gets inside my bones, the vibrations resonating through me. It's like lying back and relaxing into a really good massage. Sometimes I listen to this (and 10 New Songs) on my ipod when I'm in bed at night. It's so soothing, musically, though I don't think most people would describe Cohen's lyrics as \\"soothing\\". This is a wonderful, must-have album for Cohen fans. Given his age, I really hope it's not his last. He just seems to get better all the time. He has an amazing, powerful talent.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|A very entertaining book with very useful concepts and really nice to read. I recommend this book to anyone who want to get better skills to pitch anything.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The reviews concerned me some going in but I actually enjoyed this movie quite a lot! Not to give anything away but it's reminiscent of Independence Day. This is a movie I can watch more than once over time. I wish I had bought it outright rather just renting it.

1409443469|5.0|AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD - AN INTERESTING READ FOR LAWYERS AND SCHOLARS IN THIS FIELD<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Recently published by Ashgate Publishing, this is a timely publication in view of the burgeoning threat inherent in money laundering worldwide. The book is presented as the first of its kind to have focused on the worrying link between money laundering and developing economies.<br /><br />Specifically, the immense and special difficulties such countries face when tackling money laundering are subjected to detailed scrutiny and analysis and backed by a great deal of pertinent research.<br /><br />The author, Norman Mugarura, suggests certain factors such as, for example, corruption, lack of adequate infrastructure and the failure of systems (systemic failure) in less developed countries as being largely to blame for the proliferation of this type of criminal activity.<br /><br />We assume that `systemic failure' refers to the inefficiency of, or lack of, efficient and/or ethics-based administrative and judicial systems to combat this and similar crime and corruption-related problems. `Unfortunately in some jurisdictions,' admits Mugarura, `the role of the courts is undercut by the obduracy of governments, which treat them as conduits for their wishes.... (and) `mere accessories of the state, primarily interpreting laws to foster the will of parliament.'<br /><br />Yes, this international problem appears multi-faceted and intractable, but the author nevertheless calls for `a global anti-money laundering framework' which, in his view (if we are interpreting this correctly) might well be hampered, or thwarted by a number of challenges related to `the dynamics of the market economy' -- presumably that which exists in developed countries -- such as deregulation, liberalization and conflict of laws.<br /><br />Law certainly meets international financial crime and criminology analysed from a global perspective in this book.<br /><br />Commercial law practitioners and others specializing in comparative law will find it of interest, as will students and academics doing research in this area.  Speaking of research, there is a lengthy and useful bibliography - about six pages long to be precise -- of learned articles, publications and books pertaining to this subject (with titles such as `Dirty Money'), plus useful indexing.<br /><br />The four appendices, also useful, include the deliberations of The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental body which recommends various anti-money laundering processes, principles and procedures.  The book certainly reflects the copious amount of research and hard work expended by the author and is certainly valuable for that.  The publication date is cited as at 2012.d from a global perspective in this book.<br /><br />Commercial law practitioners and others specializing in comparative law will find it of interest, as will students and academics doing research in this area.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is a strong, fitting conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy.  I know some people want Katniss to be a kick-ass heroine and are disappointed that she spends a portion of this book either hiding or being used by District 13 for its own purposes.  I think this is what makes Katniss a believable character and not an icon.  She's a 17-year-old girl who has seen death, who has killed, and who has just lost Peeta, the boy she had sworn to protect with her own life.  I can understand why she wants to hide away and let the adults deal with things.<br /><br />But Katniss gets dragged into the war, and eventually she starts thinking for herself and making her own decisions.  She once again answers the question \\"Who is the enemy?\\" with devastating effect.<br /><br />Mockingjay is a story of grief, joy, love and loss and heroism and a girl becoming an adult.  The ending is satisfying, though too brief.  We're left with characters who have suffered tremendously, and will forever show the effects of that suffering, but who are able, like the dandelion, to survive and even bloom after the harshest winter.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|After hearing the reports on the reviews for the Speedlight from our son and seeing his photos we were sold.  The flash provides a nice warm, natural and rich tone to the photos. First time I used flash was at the DC Fest Concert. The photos were taken from the second row and turned out nicely.  Depending on the background lighting on the stage, I switched back and forth between the built in flash on our Nikon and the Speedlight. The lock is secure and you can remove flash quickly.  I highly recommend.
0385334206|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut offered \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" to himself as a fiftieth birthday present, a way to say \\"Goodbye, Blue Monday\\" to his obvious issues with own depression and his mother's suicide. Viewed uncharitably, BoC might be seen as the author treating his reader as therapist, spewing whatever invective comes into his mind onto the page. But the reason this is more interesting than your average midlife crisis is because, not only is Vonnegut hilarious, but Vonnegut's crisis represents that of the country, which in 1973 finds itself embroiled in a deep and seemingly intractable crisis of capitalism, the promises of post-war growth so clearly spent, with the results of communities torn asunder, environmental devastation, racial strife, and imperialist imbroglio. Growing up in the depression (\\"so many Americans believed then: that the nation would be happy and just and rational when prosperity came\\"), coming of age during the World War (in which he would see an even more unjust and irrational side than most), Vonnegut must settle his accounts not only with his parents but with the false promises of American ideology - and does so right off the bat in the irreverent first chapter.<br /><br />Despite the \\"evil nonsense which children were taught\\", the country with the \\"balderdash\\" national anthem was founded by \\"sea pirates\\" who \\"used human beings for machinery\\" and \\"disciplined other countries by threatening to shoot big rockets on them\\". And consistent with the growing concerns of the early 1970s, the industrial destruction of the land is a major theme in BoC. Vonnegut's alter-ego and creation Kilgore Trout surveys the damage as he hitchhikes in an olive truck past New Jersey sludge and West Virginia strip-mining. In Trout's science fiction, alien visitors note that the \\"every form of life on the once peaceful and moist and nourishing blue-green ball was dying or dead\\". Of course, Trout has long since given up: \\"There's a river in Cleveland which is so polluted it catches fire about once a year. That used to make me sick, but I laugh about it now.\\" Gilgongo! As it's not just the landscape that's bleak, Trout sees himself (and thus does Vonnegut) as \\"a representative of all the thousands of artists who devoted their entire lives to a search for truth and beauty - and didn't find doodley-squat!\\"<br /><br />Instead, Vonnegut scribbles a charcoal of a world where \\"human beings are robots, are machines\\". He looks back on the syphilitics he used to see in Depression Indianapolis \\"vertebrae welded together after the corkscrews got through with the meat between\\". To Vonnegut in crisis, we are all symphilitics, defective machinery; \\"machines made out of meat\\", \\"black machines\\", \\"agreeing machines\\", \\"defective child-bearing machine\\", \\"disappearing machine\\". Machines driven deterministically by \\"bad chemicals\\". And since humans are machines, we are acquainted with minute details of every orifice and sex act that they like to perform. This is the early 1970s after all, and America and Kilgore Trout are getting acquanted with Times Square smut houses.<br /><br />Of course, while Dwayne Hoover learns to think humans are machines from Kilgore Trout (their meeting is the plot anchor of the book), Vonnegut doesn't actually think so - or at least he is conflicted. There is a strip of day-glo orange tape running down his dark canvas. That is the abstract art of Rabo Karabekian, representing \\"the immaterial core of every animal... it is unwavering and pure, no matter what preposterous adventure may befall us.\\"<br /><br />Through Vonnegut though, the \\"unwavering and pure\\" side of the human spirit doesn't seem all that convincing. It's more something he must believe in, to keep the bad chemicals from forcing him to succumb to the same fate as his mother, Dwayne Hoover's wife, etc.
0754677281|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2AIODRV5E9RJC]]<br /><br />THE RULE AND ROLE OF LAW IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Recently published by Ashgate, `Legitimacy, Legal Development and Change' presents a collection of articles and essays which set out to explore, analyse and define the often complex and wide-ranging area of what we would call comparative jurisprudence; in this case legal development in the developing world.<br /><br />The book brings together the work of twenty-six academics and scholars from top universities and institutions worldwide. In the words of editor David K. Linnan, the book `explores overlapping themes, asking how legal development and change actually works and focusing on specific examples of legal systems, mainly in non-Western jurisdictions in Asia, Africa, the Islamic world and additionally, South America.<br /><br />The book in our view references one of Jurgen Habermas's thesis, developed in the 1980s on what was termed the `legitimation crisis', which basically asks the question, `who sets the political agenda?  Is it Parliament, (comprising the government [executive] and legislature)? Or is it the legal establishment, including lawyers and the judiciary?  Or is it social change which is eventually legitimized by law? Or is it law which dictates social change?<br /><br />In common law jurisdictions, the common law often makes the cases and establishes precedents.  This constitutes development largely by evolution rather than revolution, of law and legal systems, although there have been some quite explosive revolutions along the way in common law countries, with people fighting for their rights based on a particular value system which places freedom at the top of the collective wish list.<br /><br />Bearing all this in mind, this book is interesting in that it is a jurisprudential collection which points the way forward toward legal philosophical thinking from a global perspective, now and in the future.<br /><br />The learned articles are grouped under five categories, from `Changing the ROL Narrative' (Rule of Law, in case you didn't know.) to `International Law as Legal Development Subject', which includes an article on the European Court of Human Rights and the Diversity of Legal Cultures.  Parts II and III centre on religious law, particularly The Qur'anic Perspective - (and thank goodness there are a couple of women's rights articles included).  Japan and Russia are scrutinized in Parts IV and VI.<br /><br />The various contributors, all with impressive academic and professional credentials, each appear to discuss the multiplicity of issues involved from an entirely objective, empirical viewpoint without any obvious political or partisan bias.<br /><br />In striving for complete objectivity, however, some cannot fail to betray either a pro-Western or anti-Western mindset, which is, of course, understandable. Says the editor:  `given the presence of non-Western alongside Western models for legal development, whose modernization concept becomes the operative question.'  Boy, it sure does become `the operative question,' we would add -- and the choice is crucial.<br /><br />Developing countries generally, do not have centuries of legal evolution to fall back on as a paradigm, so what choice will they make toward their own recently evolving, i.e. `modernizing' legal systems?  Will they indeed `modernize', or regress?  The future welfare of millions depends on the answer, or answers -- and this book certainly provides an important contribution to this vital debate.from a global perspective, now and in the future.<br /><br />The learned articles are grouped under five categories, from `Changing the ROL Narrative' (Rule of Law, in case you didn't know.) to `International Law as Legal Development Subject', which includes an article on the European Court of Human Rights and the Diversity of Legal Cultures.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game on my Kindle.  I have found it to be fun for different ages. It is easy to play in the beginning. Yet becomes more challenging as levels advance.
B002LLE3PY|4.0|I have bought three 40th anniversary series titles. Red, Discipline and Lizard. There is a problem with Lizard.It plays in my cheap Apex DVD player but doesn't play in my Pioneer DVD player. I don't know what's going on with this disc but it's something. The other KC I mentioned all play fine but Lizard doesn't. Now of course it can be played but not on the better DVD player I have. I can't understand it. I am not accessing the DVD audio part but the DTS part as I don't have a DVD audio player. It still should play in DTS and it does in the cheap Apex that I have. If I didn't have a back up DVD player then It would be worthless. So I guess take your chances and hope that it plays for you.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I absolutely loved the first two books in this series, but i didn't think this one had that Â«sparkÂ». In half of the story, Katniss is hiding in a corner crying about her life. But my main issue was the ending. You can tell it was meant to be happy, or even sentimental, but it doesn't have a great effect with all that fighting 10 pages away. The last we hear of Gale, Â«He got some fancy job in district 4Â». For me, it is not that they ended their relationship, but that we got zero details about it. I have a million questions, like what kind of government is Panem now? Did the Hunger Games continue? All in all, I didn't think it was quite a satisfactory.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I expected to get light/summer/beach type of book but this was beyond my wildest dreams how bad it was. The structure of sentence is as if illiterate person was an author and the whole time I had a feeling that author was addressing to sexually frustrated population who are too embarrassed to watch porn because somebody might caught them. In addition, the vocabulary is less than poor and if someone would count the number of words that this person was using there won't be probably more that 100 including articles.<br /><br />I must admit that I was skipping a lot because it is mission impossible to read this material (it is insulting to call it a book)<br /><br />The author was able to go so low and flirt in the most superficial and banal way with human sexuality and what's behind it.<br /><br />And NO, smart, handsome, attractive and rich guys don't fall for some insecure, no manners, don't know nothing (music, art, food, places...) type of girls and marry them.<br />And NO,  just finished university, insecure, don't know nothing (music, art, food, places...) type of girls get jobs in cool publishing house on the high position.<br /><br />Horrible plot, even worse \\"development\\" of the story and end is the best because there is no more of it (if you make it to an end)
B0072GPQ72|3.0|Like many Spielberg movies, \\"War Horse\\" is extremely sentimental - from the John Williams soundtrack to the writing. Sentimental movies can be very good; however, this movie failed to really get me to care too much for the characters, which is essential for a sentimental movie to work. Yes, it was nice how Albert bonded with the horse Joey and they defied the odds when it came to plowing a field. But Albert still didn't feel three-dimensional to me and he was the one character besides Joey which the movie spent the most time on.<br /><br />I went in with the feeling that everything would work out just fine, so despite the setting being World War I, I never had a sense of danger. I expected a lot of sorta crazy things to happen if the two were to somehow get through the war together; however, there were too many unbelievable moments, not just mere coincidences. My favorite scenes were the grandfather and little girl in France who found the horse in their windmill. But how in the world did they not hear the regiment of German troops over the hill when he sent her off riding up the hill? The scene where a British soldier and a German soldier work together to save the horse in no man's land was almost laughable to me, when I'm sure it was meant to be touching. Overall, it felt like the movie was trying too hard but still not succeeding in pulling at the heart strings.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|Whoa, I wasn't expecting that.  Yeah, I loved me some Joe Walsh back in the James Gang day, but I got this just for old time sake.  Then I was taken back by those fat Joe Walsh licks and bounce in the bass.  Excellent album!  There are five or six songs here I really love, enough to spring for the album and then some.  Congratulations, Joe, on a ground-breaking mid-career work, and thanks for the searing high leads especially!
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Movie is only so-so, but I bought the Blu-Ray for the surround sound. That's where it shines. A decent home theater setup with a sub and it's worth the $6 or so for the movie just to hear the great sound.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Totally did not get her at first but Amazon had her album on sale so I bought it and I am so glad I did, she is wonderfully talented; thoughtful lyrics with a deceptive edginess.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|I would rate this book 5 stars. I loved the whole storyline, however the reason I'm only giving it one star is because Suzanne Collins killed Prim. Prim is the reason the whole series came into existance, and she just gets killed at the end. Sad. But, apart from that, a very well written and enjoyable book!
1469984202|5.0|The stories grow in the telling.  The first book is little more than a short story, the last one a full-length book.  The author tells the story well, the reader never knowing more than the characters within.  The questions you have while you read may never be answered.<br /><br />In that way, if you like to hover god-like above the story knowing all, you'll be disappointed.  Instead the story slowly unfolds and you're left wanting to know more.  I'm leaving Book 5 to dive into the prequel now.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Love this game and its finally on android! Get this game now! Tons of replayability. Fun graphics and missions. Definitely save your coins to buy flash the dog
B008VNIA32|5.0|I just want to chime in to thank Kultur for releasing my favorite Ring Cycle in video in the blu-ray format.(*) Compared with [[ASIN:B005FWO3QK Kultur's previous DVD release]] of the same performance, this blu-ray release has slight enhancement in the video and in the DTS 5.1 audio track, but with no perceptible difference in the LPCM audio track. Here are some points which might prove useful for your purchase decision.<br /><br />0. This Ring Cycle was filmed in the summer of 1991 and 1992 at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus without the audience, after a 5-year period of Bayreuth Workshop. It is the first Ring Cycle recorded in the true surround setting. Perhaps due to the 5-year experience, the performers have the wonderful sense of \\"living-in\\" the drama.<br /><br />1. If my personal taste is any guide, this is by very far the best musical performance of the ring cycle ever recorded *in video* to date. Daniel Barenboim proves himself a true Wagner conductor (and a true disciple of Wilhelm Furtwängler) with this magnificently intense performance, probably the best in decades. Here every detail in the score contributes to the drama and no dramatic event is not underlined by the music. He also picked many fresh voices over the established Wagnerian singers. For example neither Anne Evans nor John Tomlinson is your average Wagner singer. Several of the principals had never performed their roles before, including Tomlinson, Jerusalem, and von Kannen. They however deliver their roles with fresh voice and insight. (It's worth noting that Evans and many others in this production had been trained by Reginald Goodall in the [[ASIN:B00005LZVY English National Opera's Ring production]] and it shows.) On the theatrical front, Harry Kupfer's probing production can probably share the pantheon with [[ASIN:B0009F2EPU Bayreuth Centennial Ring production by Patrice Chéreau]]. At least, these two are my favorite staging of the Ring, with [[ASIN:B0019LZ19O The Copenhagen Ring]] running adistant third. On the surface, Kupfer's unconventional characterization of the characters can seem extreme. However, the inner logic quickly reveals itself (especially on the repeat viewing) and the extremism becomes inevitability. Wagner's music thus reaches its fullest dramatic potential.<br /><br />2. The previous [[ASIN:B005FWO3QK Kultur DVD release]] has greatly improved the video and audio quality over the preceding Warner Classics releases in [[ASIN:B000QFBW6K Der Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)]] and [[ASIN:B002G1TSBI Ring Des Nibelungen (7 DVD)]]. Now with the blu-ray release the video and the DTS sound track  see some further improvements. I have had mixed feeling about Kultur. On the one hand, I am thankful that the company keeps a lot of music films in print at affordable prices. On the other hand, their DVD post-production work is often subpar. Too often, the company chooses low bitrate processing/encoding to fit the film into less DVD discs. As a  result, grainy video with distorted colors and heavily compressed poor audio quality are almost synonymous to Kultur. There, however, Kultur surprises us with this very high quality work. According to the booklet, both video and the audio are remastered from the original high definition master tapes. In order to maximize the video/audio quality of this new presentation Kultur decides to spread the opera into 11 DVD discs, with highest bitrates. The improvements in both departments are nothing less than spectacular. Now the video is crystal clear and the sound has stunning depth, both in LPCM and in DTS 5.1 tracks. Even if you own the previous Warner release, the upgrade is well worth it.<br /><br />3. This blu-ray edition is an ALL REGION release. So go ahead and purchase it even if you don't live in Northern America.<br /><br />4. It is worth repeating that even if the resolution of video and sound is identical to the previous [[ASIN:B005FWO3QK Kultur's DVD edition]], it is just so much more convenient to have one disc per opera/night. Save viewers the hassle of constantly changing discs! Now, with the improved video and audio, the choice is obvious for those who own a blu-ray player.<br /><br />5. However, this is an early HiFi video recording and there is infrequent streaking in the dark black area. The multi-channel setting also places emphasis on the two main speakers. In terms of technical aspects, you will not mistake this as a new recording. The best reason to buy this set is for its artistic merits.<br /><br />Most highly recommended.<br />----------------<br />(*) I was among the first group to have purchased Kultur's release of remastered Barenboim's Bayreuth Ring cycle. Initially, Kultur goofed up in the first release. The LPCM sound track on the second half of Disc 8 was in mono. (That is, Siegfried Act III, Track 11 onward, right after Siegfried's \\"Das ist kein Mann!\\".) Fortunately, Kultur owns up the mistake: Not only was the problem quickly fixed once the company was notified, but they also sent out free replacement discs when contacted. (I got my replacement copy promptly.)<br /><br />While corresponding with Kultur's \\"John\\", I urged the company to release it in the blu-ray format. \\"Even if the resolution of video and sound can not be further improved, it is just so much more convenient to have one disc per opera/night!\\" And I pledged to purchase the blu-ray version once it is released. (As you can see, I pre-ordered the set!) So consider this review a thank-you note to Kultur.
B006LSZECO|4.0|At first I thought it was your typical boy/girl story.  But.... boy I was incorrect.  Enjoyable! LOVE the female character.  It's a MUST read! I don't want to give too much away, so you have to read it!

B004U8VUUC|5.0|Fans of creepy murder mysteries will love this film, especially since it's based on a true crime story from New York.  Gosling's portrayal is utterly spine chilling...desperate, mad, murderous.  No idea why this film didn't win every award--it's brilliant
B005Y423ZC|1.0|I bought 2 CD / DVD on the same day. Sade Adu - Bring Me Home - Live 2011 and Adele Live At The Royal Albert Hall. The comparison is inevitable. While Sade offers a super show with stage production, lighting, visual effects, and lots of music one after another, Adele sits on a bench for a monologue with the audience before each song. She talks, talks, talks and talks. So you're tired and decides go forward using the remote control. After some time going ahead, nothing changes, she's still talking. This happens in almost every song. I found it somewhat disrespectful .... I do not recommend this Adele's DVD to anyone.
0345308239|4.0|Although hindsight is naturally vastly better than foresight, one should be aware of the disasters that have played out in history and attempt to avoid similar problems!  The Catholic Church and the monarchs it empowered imagined themselves as endowed with a divine right to decide everything for everybody.  The British  Parliament thought itself to be the legitimate virtual representative of its citizens in the American Colonies.  American generals and presidents believed that propping up the Vietnamese domino with the blood and sweat of its citizens would give rise to a self-sufficient democracy able to efficiently hold back communism.  In each case the rulers imagined a static world where inertia would keep things in place.  Barbara Tuchman catalogs the mistakes made by those in power, and shows that even those who History traditionally viewed as successful rulers sometimes set the stage for ensuing catastrophes.<br /><br />An interesting case in point considered by the author is that of King Louis XIV's revocation of The Treaty of Nantes which lead to the expulsion of the French Huguenots.  In doing so, France lost many of its most industrious citizens to enemy states Holland and Prussia.  Indeed, I have spoken to Germans who have Huguenot ancestors, one of whom bore the German version (Weinacht) of the French surname of my own Huguenot ancestors: Noel.

Not sure this is a fault of MapsWithMe because I have another GPS dependent program that has the same issue.
B00005RYKU|2.0|When there parents die in a tragic accident,A teen and her kid brother go to stay with there wealthy family friends,the Glasses in Malibu.But little do the sibling know,the Glasses are hiding a very sinister secret.When I first heard of this movie I thought it would be a decent thriller,with an interesting premise that looked promising enough.But unfortunately I was wrong.It lacked the thrills I was looking for with a very disappointing plot twist that i am not going to give away.Leeleee Sobieski made a very boring and overall uninteresting and pretty bland heroine but at least Stellan Skarsgard made a somewhat decent villain.Overall this film was just a disappointing thriller all around.
1932100385|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and she told me at the time that I should only read the book if I was prepared to dramatically alter my diet.  I was curious, but I didn't really believe her, and I dug into the book.  She was right.  The book is so convincing that by the time I was half way through, I was talking to my wife about reducing the amount of animal based protein in our diets.<br /><br />It's now been about two years since we've been vegetarians or flexitarian (mostly veggie), and we plan to raise our children the same way.  I was fit and healthy before I changed my diet, but I feel better and have lost weight since embarking on this diet.<br /><br />I'll also say that the book was obviously incredibly interesting and easy to read.

1451683405|3.0|The insight doing all the philosophical work here is this: you can't pinpoint the discrete fraction of a second where conscious intention causes something that neuronal billiard balls do not. The empirical back-up are several experiments that show (A) tell-tale firings in the brain slightly before a person thinks he or she has made some kind of choice, and (B) certain techniques (think hypnosis) that can allow a researcher to influence a choice that the subject believes he or she made independently. The armchair version of all this is the thought experiment in which you try to identify introspectively where YOU rather than your brain decides, say, to move your left hand rather than your right. From this evidence, the annihilation of freedom is proclaimed.<br /><br />As a reader, I experienced all this as rather underwhelming, despite Harris's undeniable essayistic flare. The first problem in my mind (free or not!) is that the messy relation between the \\"inside\\" and \\"outside\\" perspective on freedom as demonstrated by such experiments is hardly a basis for making some kind of conclusive judgment, in the infancy of neuroscience, about minds and causation. (See [[ASIN:0195399692 The Oxford Handbook of Free Will: Second Edition]] for philosophical reservations about this data that a serious study should address with more than dismissive name-calling, of which Harris is occasionally guilty.) In his zeal, Harris may demonstrate a failure of imagination here. If I understand him correctly, there is mechanistic-materialist causation and a hard-dualist mental causation and nothing important in between. I think this cannot be right. Aesthetically, it is too simple a solution to such a complex problem. There are too many terms involved whose philosophical meaning is not obvious. [[ASIN:0393049914 Terrence Deacon]], for one, has muddied these waters.<br /><br />Or is Harris talking about some kind of non-materialist, non-reductionist determinism? If so, I would ask if such a thing even makes sense as a concept. What is doing the determining? In the name of what, exactly, is freedom pronounced dead?<br /><br />In any case, false dichotomies are not foreign to Harris's thinking. His past discussions of religion, for instance, contain various question-begging ahistorical simplifications of actual religious thought, experience, and practice, which hardly give his reader a fair choice of viewpoints. (Scott Atran's evidence-based rejection of Harris's sociologically simplistic religion-terrorism insight is relevant here. I watched Harris give a very lame response to Atran on this point.) In the current text, his pairing of the free will doctrine and religion is something of a howler, since the entire complex of Christian doctrines surrounding original sin and free grace suggest (poetically, if you will) exactly what Harris is proclaiming. But I digress. At the very least, Harris does seem to believe, unlike the eliminative materialists, in the reality of consciousness, but only as a 100% passive after-effect of neuronal activity. It is a real ghost, but a pointless and powerless one schlepped along by the engine of the brain.<br /><br />The second problem concerns Harris's attitude towards moral responsibility. He makes the correct observation that moral thinking is too natural and valuable to reject out of hand, but I don't think he _personally_ can buy into talk of moral responsibility, since moral responsibility can hardly be a coherent concept to one has lifted the veil of Maya and perceived the illusion of freedom. He asserts that this insight makes him more forgiving and compassionate (hardly qualities that most people would associate with his passion for cultural genocide), although these qualities cannot be to his credit, as there can be no \\"credit\\" where there is no free moral agent. The enlightened have no choice, it seems to me, but to understand this, and the whole question of value--whether realist, subjectivist, or transcendent--loses its importance. I can see no way, in short, for Harris to counter indifference, cynicism, selfishness, or depression, unless it is to say: \\"But look at me! I'm America and you can too!\\" But if someone (if there are someones) doesn't care to score cultural-political points for the congregation of the righteous? What then? Can you (if there are yous) simply ignore the irony of it all? I personally could not. I would find everything too stupid for words.<br /><br />The enigma of selfhood is a tremendous thing to ponder. It is certainly true that the full moral, cognitive, and metaphysical meaning of the \\"I\\" is mysterious and potentially unsettling. Also, only by understanding the deep embeddedness of consciousness in a biological framework can the wonder and the constraints of sentience and moral consciousness first come to light. At points Harris takes our thoughts in such directions, but in the end I feel that he trivializes the whole shebang for the sake of ideological closure. And, I'm guessing, a cheer from some choir or other.
0439023513|3.0|Spoiler Alert for the whole review)<br />I fell inlove with the characters of the Hunger Games and was really vested in the outcomes of their struggles.  So much so that I didn't mind the lengthy and painful lapses of Katniss's sanity during Mockingjay or yet another lengthy and gruesome version of the games done for the 3rd time.  I thought the book was appropriately dark.  Katniss is consistently a pawn with others determining the outcome of her life which she constantly bucks.  However, we were shut out of the last great check mate.  I really wanted to sit with Katniss in her cell during her trial and this time helplessly watch the television as others played one more game with her life in order to paint the picture of her insanity.  Why were we shut out of the most exciting part of the book and why didn't we ever get to know the intentions a Doctor who was instrumental at getting her declared a lunatic?  Also why did everyone work so hard to get her off then they dropped off the face of the earth without a word?<br /><br /> Gale was an amazing character with a connection to Katniss that few people experience.  Peeta was the clearly the only man who could really make Katniss happy.  Did Collins really need to make Gale partially responsible for Prim's death to justify her choosing Peeta who by the was was clearly the obvious resolution from book 1.  I would have liked to see Katniss actually choose too.  It felt like Katniss was handed her new life and never seized what she needed to survive the way she did through the rest of the series.  The end fizzled instead of popped.  Also, I wanted to see Katniss and Peeta grow together again not be told in one line that it happened.  I would have rather seen Katniss kill herself at the end then this lame halfway choice and being with Peeta in this halfhearted forced way.  If Collins hadn't stripped Gale of his greatness then she would have needed to paint the star crossed lover match better.  Both would have left me better satisfied.<br />Finally, for someone who has meant so much to so many, it's amazing how her best friend, mother and everyone just dumps her off in the victor's village and never does anything accept maybe call or write.<br />So Katniss becomes her mother in the end.  I loved that part!  No matter how different or how much you hate your mom you'll end up acting just like her.  This is especially great considering the audience is many teen girls who's biggest fear is to become their mom  However, Collins dropped the ball this point in the plot too.  Why wasn't mom treating her with the herbs to help her out of the immobilizing depression?  What sort of a mother skips off without even saying goodbye in person?<br />Snow's death was also disappointing.  No one cared how he died?  Come on,I certainly did and I would have loved to see Joanna's ax in his head while he laughed.<br />I've been forced to build senerios in my mind because Collins did not really finish writing the book and I'm not a writer, I can't imagine that I'm creating a better ending than Collins could if she set her mind to it.<br /><br />I didn't want to watch Katniss skip off in the sunset or have a happily ever after, I just wanted to feel the conclusion through several pages of nail biting writing rather than having it all summed up by the author who seems to have lost interest in these characters.er satisfied.<br />Finally, for someone who has meant so much to so many, it's amazing how her best friend, mother and everyone just dumps her off in the victor's village and never does anything accept maybe call or write.<br />So Katniss becomes her mother in the end.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Mediocre 'romantic'  novel, mildly titillating, predictable plot, and the bondage brouhaha? It is so tame as to be merely a plot device to make it appear edgy and nothing more
1476712042|4.0|Deliciously Insane. Chaotic.Passionate.I began this book by listening to the audio book, which I am still listening to.  By the fourth disc sitting in the car just wasn't fast enough for me, so I had to grab the book and I devoured it within hours. The audio is great but I craved the reading experience more at the moment, I had to know what happened right then even though I just got off of work at 2 a.m. That said this review will be of both the audio and the print version of the book.<br /><br />Audio: The narrator does an excellent job of differentiating the gender of the characters. Although, the tone of voice seemed deep for both the male and female, it is easy to distinguish which character is speaking. The production is single- voiced and clear, and the volume is just right. I think this book works well in audio format and the narrator makes the book appealing to the ears. The pace is fast, but I could easily keep up; I liked how easily it flows. It wasn't until I decided that I was going to get the book that I finally turned my CD player off and got out of my car. My listening experience in no way disconnected me from the characters and I felt like the relationship was sweet between Travis and Abby, whereas....<br /><br />My reading experience enveloped me in the book in an entirely different way. I wasn't focusing on what I was hearing, but rather digesting and visualizing the events that transpire between the characters. Travis and Abby are truly dysfunctional on so many levels, but that is the beauty of how they are that saves them. As a reader some will become focused on the aggressive nature in the book, but I see all sides. Yes, Travis is too obsessed with Abby; yet she is the key to the one thing he has buried since his mother died: Love. He grew up in a male household with no feminine influence at all, so I can see how his treatment of women came about, even though it's not acceptable.<br />This is where Abby comes in she calls him out on his mess andthat's what he needs. It was nice to see the changes in him as he pursues a friendship with her. Abby is far from perfect.She is screwed up by the past at the hands of a gambling father, who blames her for his bad luck. She leaves to get away from all that and she sees in Travis the past that she is running from, even though he isn't. The only person blind to the chemistry between them is Abby, until she can't pretend any longer that she has feelings for Travis. No relationship is happy go lucky or perfect, nor is it Edward and Bella(even they were crazy)...sometimes relationships are volatile and disastrous, which is exactly what this is. However, it shows that even in the midst of all they put each other through,they realize that they need each other and that together they work well. No, they do not physically abuse each other but in an effort to make each other happy they hurt each other emotionally. I feel that if they just talked about things they would've saved themselves some trouble.<br /><br />We as a society are attracted to chaos. Look at reality TV as a prime example. Though we know its pure insanity, some of us get sucked in because we want to know how it ends. Beautiful Disaster is an intense mess, but the love is beautiful. For me, this book is about the ability to live the experience of how it feels to be in this type of relationship. The writing is realistic and it felt like I was inside the book as events began to unfold. I look forward to getting into Travis's head in the next book. Overall, an interesting read that I recommend to a mature audience.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|As per my title, I am a big fan of this movie for its overview of how the investment banking community used politicians--who have AND continue to take investment bank money, to exploit the real estate world and to further help bankrupt America.  CDO's and Credit Default Swaps are highlighted but a viewer needs no knowledge of these to enjoy this film.  If you have read, Liar's Poker, this is a great follow-on to how fraud at the highest levels continues to undermine hard working Americans.  The best part to me is the unbias to any political group.  My lesson came seeing how Obama has the same stooges that helped steal in the Clinton and Bush administrations.  Nice job Mr. President bringing change.  I guess he too will be on the \\"inside\\" on their payrolls once he steps out of office.
0345803485|1.0|I love romance novels- contemporary or historical- from Judith McNaught and Anya Seton to Georgette Heyer and Jane Austen.  Like others, I was really excited to read this book given its popularity.  After finishing the book, I'm convinced that if you are a fan, then this must be your first romance novel.  The premise is intriguing albeit unbelievable, but it is the execution that is SO lacking.  Ana is annoyingly immature- tripping, biting her lip, blushing, the constant \\"does he like me.\\" It came to a point when I wanted to tie her up and gag her.<br /><br />And, how is this book erotic or edgy?  The sex scenes are so juvenile they seemed to be written by an amateur. All in all, there are just SO MANY better romance novels with and without the sex scenes- try \\"Paradise\\" or \\"Whitney My Love\\" by Judith McNaught, \\"Slammed\\" by Colleen Hoover (young adult), Susan Elizabeth Phillips, Jennifer Crusie, and the list goes on.

B0023SDPS6|1.0|I love watching the Longmire TV series.  Purchased the book with hopes that it would be at least similar to the TV show. Very disappointed that the characters are different, in description,personality and portrayal. The author's style of writing is hard to follow; not smooth reading at all. I stopped reading halfway through the book; didn't want it to ruin the TV series for me. I will NOT purchase another Walt Longmire Mystery book.  Regret that I purchased even one.

0439023491|2.0|Suzanne Collins is a find YA author, and the Hunger Games trilogy builds nicely as it develops. Each book gets more political and less about adventure, which is a nice change from so many series that quickly become more and more mindless as you get into the later books.<br /><br />however, my low rating has to do with Scholastic's horrible decision to pull the softcover off the market so that people can only buy the hardcover new.  This is the sort of profit-hungry move that drives people to piracy. If this book had never had a softcover edition, then fine - that's one thing. But this book WAS in softcover, and they have pulled that version off the market to maximize their profits.
B000022TSW|5.0|I always see a lot of reviews ABOUT the movies. I know when I read a review I read them to see how the product arrived, if it was a fake copy, etc. So, this movie arrived in great condition! The disk wasn't scratched and the case was in great shape! If you're curious as to how good the movie is all you need to know is that if you like South Park then you'll love the movie. Plain and simple. So, in other words, it was awesome! People should rent things before buying them and then write a bad review.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|This sounded like a good movie and I actually enjoyed it until the ending.  The ending ruined the entire movie for me.  I would not recommend it to anyone.

0060512806|5.0|I first read Crypto in 2002 or so, and have revisited it several times since.  Always better in the retelling.  Wickedly funny, surprising twists, social commentary, and just a great yarn.  Could not recommend it more.

B000G6R7B8|5.0|I had this watch for about 10 days now and am not wearing any of my others.  And this is the most inexpensive of the lot by many multiples.  It has kept virtually perfect time for the 10 days and I never had to reset it as I expected would be necessary from an an inexpensive automatic.  It is very light on the wrist and while the numbers are kinda ridiculous for normal people, I tend to tell time by the position of the hands.  I highly recommend for what it is recognizing it is not a TAG or Rolex<br />.  Only minor issue is that the watch is only slightly water resistent.  SO now showering or swimming with it.  I had bought and returned the larger more expensive (and more jewels) version of this, a Seiko SNZ series.  I*t kept terrible time and would not run longer than about 6 hours once you took it off your wrist.  No problems like that with this self-winding watch.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|THIS IS A DEEP, DARK STORY OF A DYSFUNCTIONAL MARRIED COUPLE AND IS A CLASSIC.  PAIN HAS NO BOUNDARIES.  IT SHOWS THE THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE AND HOW DANGEROUS GETTING CLOSE TO THE LINE IS.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|A lovely visual spectacle set in a great fantasy world, sometimes brutal, sometimes sexy, with production values more like large-budget movies than TV.  The BluRays play fine on my Sony BD player (current firmware), with no artifacts or problems.<br /><br />I've been a fan of GRRM (the author of the series, a Song of Fire and Ice) long before the show, making me the \\"skeptical audience\\" for an on-screen translation, but his participation in making this series is evident in how closely the shows hew to the original storyline.  The few divergences stand out for their rarity.  It's also evident in how many episodes there are per book-- just enough to convey such a complex story, but far better than the usual condensed Hollywood versions of books.<br /><br />The shows are distinctly more sexy than the books, and a little less violent, but it feels balanced.  And who would object to a little sexiness (particularly if you don't object to the bloodshed!).<br /><br />The shows are also a little less gritty than the books.  People are mostly healthier, life appears less hardscrabble than the accurately pre-industrial depictions in the books.  For example, Tyrion is a reasonably attractive dwarf, rather than an ugly, misshapen dwarf as he is in the books.<br /><br />I won't rehash reviews of the episodes or story-lines, suffice it to say that the plot is complex, the cast large, the story enormous, very compelling, and occasionally shocking.  I say read the books first, but definitely watch it as well!  Highly recommended.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is a great miniseries. This 4-disc, 7.5-hour-long, 14-part miniseries is an adaptation of the novel \\"Little Dorrit\\" by Victorian-era writer Charles Dickens. The novel was originally published as a \\"serial\\" between 1855 and 1857. Set in pre-Victorian 1820s London, the story follows the life of the title character, Dorrit, working as a seamstress while her father is locked away in debtor's prison. Claire Foy is brilliant in the title role of Dorrit. If you do not fall in love with her, you have no heart.  Revealing any more of the plot (as other Amazon reviewers have done here) would create \\"spoilers.\\" Anyone who enjoys Dickens, or character-driven stories in general, will enjoy this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is way fun maybe one of the funnest games i have ever played i really like it me and my brothers enjoy it we could play it for hours! :)
B0052GACNM|5.0|Tony Bennett hand picked each one specifically.  Saw the channel 6 KVIE show on this and it was great.  The disc is not only a CD but you can put in in the computer as well for interviews etc.  i highly recommend this.
0618918248|5.0|Dawkins goes through various scientific subjects and analyzes them including references, examples, and stories within each chapter, to help you understand how you should shape your own philosophy about the world.<br /><br />Dawkins enlightens us with great detail on physics, sociology, psychology, biological evolution, evolutionary psychology, astronomy, politics, and philosophy to explain how science and reasoning can help you understand why religion is wrong on a whole number of issues without confusing you with scientific jargon and without offending people, but rather pleading with their reasoning skills.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for anyone who is thinking long and hard about politics, science, or religion.
1469984202|5.0|One more postive review for this book. This is really good. More addictive the meth, and somewhat cheaper. From the first chapter the author dangles tantalizing hints about the nature of world he is revealing, forcing you to continue reading far, far past your bedtime. The style of writing and the content is not your standard sci-fi buffet, but a delightful foray into something new and unknown.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br />Kurt A.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|So we all read sci-fi.  Chances are if your reading this review you could list off the top 20 major Science fiction writers.  Asimov, Card, Heinlein, Dick, Vonnegut, etc.  Chances are you could list off the top 20 major Science Fiction films as well; Blade Runner, Star Wars, Sunshine, 2001 Space Odyssey and so on.  The same could be said for video games assuming you have played any.<br /><br />THIS DOES NOT MAKE IT A GOOD BOOK.  A song that says your closest city (2Pac California love, Surfin USA - Beach Boys) does not make it a good song.  Granted that doesn't make it a bad song either, but this book is flows like this.<br /><br />The writer desperatley tries to relate to the reader by refrencing in the first 15% of the book every possible connection through film, books and video games.  Music is used as well but to a lesser degree.  He will mention every obvious sci-fi book and movie multiple times.<br /><br />After this is established the Writer will inject the story plot.  Its the same dystopian crap we have been reading for quite a while now.  Nothing new here people.  A corporation is the generic badguy, and the protagonist is an utter failure.<br /><br />The twist is \\"The Matrix\\" or \\"Metaverse\\"--- whatever you want to call it, it is definetly unoriginal.<br />Basically this is a COMPLETE ripoff of SNOW CRASH by Neal Stephenson.  (READ THIS YOU FOOL)<br /><br />After we have established how shitty the earth is, how bad the generic antagonist corporation is, how against the odds our protagnoist is, we are treated to hundred of pages of shit.  Shit settings, that are so poorly thought out it hurts....he doesn't even bother explaining the worlds, he just steals them from other fiction.....oh the protagonist has to find some clue related to Starwars?  Well that's convienent because the ENTIRE Star wars universe just happens to be right over here.<br /><br />IT IS SO PREDICTABLE.<br /><br />Does the protagonist suddenly have a skill or item that is needed to complete a task?  Why bother writing that in earlier in the story?  That takes work.....so the writer can just put, \\"oh btw he picked this skill up last week after he moved\\".  Trash writing.<br /><br />The good guy wins, the bad guy loses, nothing profound happens, there are no twist, there is no jerk back to reality.  No message is delivered, and nothing is in the least bit thought provoking.<br /><br />Tons of spelling mistakes in here, I don't really care.  This is the first and most likely the only review I will write, unless this guy writes a sequel.  Who am I kidding, I would never bother reading that.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|My friend lives in a rural area that does not have cable tv. I bought her the Mad Men season 1 on disk. She and her husband are so eager to see what will happen next that they are watching 2 shows each night. This was a great gift idea. I will be able to buy them the next season for upcoming gift occasions.<br /><br />She did mention that the beginning of the first episode she thought was slow and was not sure she would like the series. By the end of episode 1 she was a fan.

1452101248|5.0|Having just pitched about 100 cookbooks that I didn't look at for years, I was not in the market for another one. I usually rely on magazines for inspiration since they are seasonal. While visiting a friend, I looked at this book and became mesmerized. Everything in the book looked delicious, interesting and good for you. I couldn't wait to get my own copy and have used it almost every night since it arrived. The photography is also mouth watering - It will not disappoint!
1451627297|5.0|i just finished reading this book and i thought it was exellent!!! it's over 800 pages and there are no slow or dull parts to the book. it also has a great cast of characters,with some emotional parts as well.highly advise readers to pick this up , its not just for horror fans.

B007IXWL2C|3.0|One of my clients recommended \\"50 Shades\\" and said if you read the book, \\"...no foreplay is needed...\\" I thought that was interesting. When I mentioned the book to my husband, he said, \\"Oh, I am reading that now.\\" And I responded, \\"WHAT?????\\" He had downloaded it to his smart phone, and was reading it without ME!!! ~LOL~ I am a fast reader so under the principle of \\"what's mine is mine and what's his is mine, too\\" we fought for custody of his smartphone until I finished book 1 & 2 and then I downloaded book 3 onto MY phone. OK~ this is not GREAT WRITING (but who cares????) The cliff-hanger at the end of each book assured that the next one would be downloaded ASAP. We ended up with both of us downloading book three (duh, now THAT was economical!!!) 50 Shades is \\"kinky f*ery\\" but not TOO kinky. Just enough to be fun!

1468179993|5.0|Jeremy Donovan is a student of TED Talks. He has studied, and restudied them and qualifies himself, in my eyes, as an Expert on TED Talks.<br /><br />These presentations are considered to be at the highest level, and Jeremy's book is cut from the same bolt of cloth.<br /><br />The author says his book provides a \\"how-to\\" guide for delivering an inspiring speech based on intensive study of the most popular TED Talks. In step-by-step fashion, Jeremy tells how to select a topic, craft a narrative, master delivery, and refine design. In simple, easy to understand language, he fulfills his promise and more!<br /><br />After having written several books on presentation skills, and penned over 150 blogposts on the subject, I still learned a great deal from Mr. Donovan!<br /><br />I'm about to reread his book with a marker in hand. No doubt his teaching will show up in my future books, posts, and the presentations I deliver.<br /><br />Thank you, Jeremy!

B008S4YZCO|5.0|Well I found this game looking for something to make and this is it! You make your own little island filled with wacky attractions and monsters. Its a very interesting and fun game. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night checking up on my diggster and hornster (Fuzz and Squirt)  but with every game there's a set back and its that some of the monsters are really expensive and require crystals and crystals are not easy to get unless you use money. But other than that I love the game:)

0142001104|4.0|As is said with most motivational books, there is nothing new in here. However, the Zanders have great stories and a different angle than most similar books which makes this one a book I recommend.<br /><br />The overriding message is to get out our own way so we can see emerging possiblities instead of staying in the downward spiral. I especially like Rule #6 - Don't take yourself so seriously.<br /><br />One final note: If you ever have the opportunity to see Benjamin Zander present, do not hesitate to buy tickets. He is fabulous in the front of the room!<br /><br />Karen L. Jett, CMA, author Grow Your People, Grow Your Business and creator of the Strategic Plan-ting(TM) Workshop.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|After reading some Fantasy Romance novels I was intrigued by all the hype over this book so I decided to give it a try.  I found the heroine to be completely annoying.  She is naïve and very immature for a 21 year old college graduate, every time she bites her lip or flushes I roll MY EYES.<br /><br />What can I say about Christian? He is secretive, brooding and rich which reminds me of...Edward.  I know this was written as Twilight fan fiction but come on can't we pick some other attributes.<br /><br />I am almost finished with the book just because I am powering through. I don't care what happens to these characters and doubt I will ever pick up the rest of this trilogy.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Simple and easy and works wonderfully. I'm rethinking the Nexus 7 now, because with this app I can easily access my network attached storage, so I'm not as leery of the no-SD-card issue. Good file manager, good picture and video players. Very satisfied with this app.

6305841861|5.0|This movie is basically an unneeded redo of the first, WAIT.... now before you hit that un-helpful button I will say that this is my favorite demon-related sequel next to Night of the Demons 2 and Hellbound: Hellraiser II. The reason I said that it is unneeded is because that's what my first opinion was. But then about 5 minutes I changed that opinion drastically. Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is by far the gooiest, slimmest, and grimiest sequel in the Evil Dead Trilogy (Or which I like to call a Thrillogy). I love Army of Darkness as well but I do wish that the story stayed at the cabin and not in a medieval time but I guess the windmill scene can accompany for that.<br /><br />Plot: It is sort of an expansion of the first movie. It begins where the first one started and made midpoint and then ended all within five minutes but then they take the whole first story and twist it to make it totally original. The demons have ADHD or something because they are even more abundantly torturous and crafty than in the first one.<br /><br />Review: This film obviously had a bigger budget than the first and it uses it to the extent. I felt like when they were walking outside and the trees started movie with a totally amazing atmosphere that I was on a James Cameron 80's Movie Set! There was gore but during the late 80's The MPAA was a bitch to deal with and they made Rami take all the scenes with red colored blood and substitute it for green goo. But even with all the green goo and dismemberment I still don't believe it was that gory. I have come to the conclusion that more people knew about this one and when they saw part one they decided to merged the two and created a bloody, wild fantasy which would be awesome as hell. It is hard to make movies like this anymore.... Combining strong slapstick humor and still maintain the scare factor is not that easy, not to mention all the difficult camera shots (which from what I heard were not as back breaking as the firsts camera maneuvering) The Special Effects were great as well, plenty of ghoulish and frightening demons  with hiddious monster make-up to serve up the soul-craving fans!<br /><br />Acting: Bruce Frigging Campbell, He is the god of one liners and even though he doesn't get sprayed with as much gore as the first he still puts up on hell of a battle which ultimately makes him ultra bad-ass! The rest of the actors where colorful as well and they preformed the roles belt-tight!<br /><br />Gore: A head chopped in half with axe, green goo, a couple of scenes involving explosions of bloody gushing and spraying, a decapitation with a shovel (Wink to the Original), a hand cut off with a chainsaw (Infamous scene there!) there is even a little blue blood to go around! This cabin is \\"Where the Slime Live\\" (Morbid Angel Reference)<br /><br />Bottom Line: One of the best movies and sequels of its kind, It literally (just like the first) took something so unoriginal made it completely legit! I give a standing ovation to this movie and may it forever belong with Horror fans!<br /><br />Suggested MPAA: Rated R for horror violence, disturbing images, and some language<br /><br />Is it worth the Buy on a scale of 1-10: 10<br />For the Movie itself on a scale of 1-5: 5
B001CDZZI6|1.0|This book gives you a description of about 32 different strengths that people have, and at its core is an access code to an online Myers Briggs type assessment you can take to identify your strengths.<br /><br />The book is merely a reference for the strengths that an online assessment helps you identify, along with strengths that others may have and how you might identify these in people to work better in teams together.  The strengths identification is worthwhile, but only if you buy the print version (otherwise you don't get a code and can't take the test!)<br /><br />I originally bought the hardcopy of the book a few years ago and took the test, and then my girlfriend and I were recently reading over my assessment.  Wanting her to take the test too, I searched the Gallup website in order to purchase another code.  Ridiculously, the only way that it seems that one can take the test is by purchasing another (hardcopy) book to get a new code.  Not wanting to uselessly own two of the exact same hardcopy book on my shelf, and before I knew, I paid $14 for the Kindle version just to get a new code. I would be happy to pay $14 just for the StrengthsFinder assessment tool for my girlfriend.<br /><br />As said, it turns out that the Kindle version doesn't contain a new code.  I'm basically asking Gallup to take my money in any which way that doesn't include buying and shipping me the same useless hardcopy book again.<br /><br />To be fair I'd recommend the hardcopy book and taking the test once, but not buying the Kindle version, or owning the hardcopy twice.<br /><br />It's been around for years and I've seen many people with complaints about not being able to purchase just a code.  That's pretty lame.

030758836X|1.0|This book had me staying up until the wee hours of the morning, rushed home from work to continue, read while blow drying my hair and then I reached what was the last page of the book, where is the ending??? Feels like the author ran out of interest. Worst ending I've read in a long time!

030758836X|1.0|I knew about twenty pages into this book that I didn't like it.  I didn't like or care about either of the two main characters and that didn't change as the book progressed.  The only reason I continued to the end was because a co-worker had lent me the book and I knew he would want to discuss it with me.  Perhaps if I had liked the characters I would've been more intrigued by the mystery aspect of the story but I didn't, so I didn't.  Now, having finished the book, I know my initial impression was spot on.  I should've stopped reading twenty pages in.
B000LSYQRO|4.0|This is one of Ken Follett's early books, a fictional story of a German spy operating in England during the Second World War.  For those of us unfamiliar with the extensive spy operation of the war, this is an education in espionage.  However the story is entertaining and full of action. Mr. Follett pulls together his rather diverse characters in the Part Three of the book in an unexpected manner.<br />A slow-starter, this story becomes a page-turner and a delightful read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Never has this application steered me wrong! I love the feature which shows you what kind of activities the weather is good or bad for. By far the best weather app I've ever come across, and I see no need to buy the Platinum version, as the free one is enough!

B004UFEJS0|5.0|I just wanted to expand the suggested upper age-level for this animated Pixar movie....I'm 70 and my fiancee is 69, and we both love Ratatouille! The only difference between my review here and a 7 year old's review is that I can probably verbalize a little better what makes this Blu-ray so good.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, the story line/plot is near-perfect, the \\"acting\\" is wonderful, and the added detail of the Blu-ray technology gives an entirely new dimension to the viewers' experiences.  But of course the image quality has to first exist in the digital animation, then be displayed by your Blu-ray player...<br /><br />We haven't watched the regular DVD version yet, but I see no real reason to do so, unless our regular DVD player breaks down. The level of detail is so amazing as the scenes flow by, and this attribute itself adds an entirely new dimension to the viewing experience.  I have to recommend it (literally) for ALL age groups, it is that good, and I am not normally a huge Disney fan.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book and want to read the rest of the trilogy but I was disappointed with the ending.
0374214913|5.0|Robin Slone's book is well-researched, well-written and almost impossible to put down. It might be described as The Da Vinci Code as written by Tom Clancy, a description which does not at all do it justice. The unlikely hero, Clay Jannon, takes a clerk's job in the world's most unusual bookstore. When he delves into the store's mysteries, he enlists help from his roommate, Matt, who builds special effects, his girlfriend, Kat, a Google executive, and his childhood friend, Neel. The plot is a tightly woven, always evolving mixture of mystery, techno-thriller, fantasy, and allegory. Never a dull passage! But, remember, this is primarily a book about books. Any bibliophile will love it!
0525478817|4.0|This book brings to light a reality that is that is typically very hard for people to deal with - children who have serious/terminal cancer. But the great thing about The Fault in Our Stars is that it makes these children vibrant. Their disease does not define them and they are portrayed as lively kids whose physical limitations don't keep them from living, loving and having great adventures. This fictional tale centers on a teenager named Hazel. She is very sick and has a daily routine that includes watching America's Next Top Model, being catered to by her mother, frequent trips to see doctors and a weekly support group for children with cancer. Life is pretty uneventful until the fateful day when a new boy named Augustus Waters shows up at her support group. It is a story that is not to be missed.
030758836X|4.0|Like most people who have read this book and tried to review it, I'm finding it difficult to express what I thought of it without giving away any spoilers.  It really is a book that is best read when you don't know very much going in.<br /><br />The summary does hint at some secrets and questions how well you can know your partner or spouse.  So needless to say this book might be a bit disturbing to some because it really does make you think about such things, maybe a little more than you should. This is the first book that really messed with my head and creeped me out.  I don't recommend reading it before bed because I started having strange dreams.<br /><br />Then again, that's just a testament to how well it is written.  I think Gillian Flynn is a genius and it's amazing what she can do with words and the structure of the story, the pacing, the building up of suspense, etc.  So in that sense, this book is outstanding!<br /><br />As for the reading experience, I found it to be a bit slow and it took until part 2 for me to really get immersed in it.  Then it became a total page-turner and a race to the end to find out what would happen.
031620157X|5.0|This book was phenomenal, it captured me from the very first page. I am an eighteen year old female who loves fantasy and fairy tales and this book is hands down my favourite fantasy novel after The Harry Potter series  and The Hunger Games trilogy. I bought it for my eight year old sister and she loved the book as well. I reccommend it to readers of all ages and for anyone who enjoys far off mystic worlds! Chris Colfer is an excellent writer and he deserves all the awards for this beautiful story. I cannot wait for the sequel! So thanks Chris, for writing such a magical and fascinating novel! This novel is definetly worthy of the title of #1 New York Times best selling novel!
B005KELW26|5.0|I love this cover.  I purchased a black one for my Mom from Bi-Mart, for more money and it is does not fit or fold as well as this Belkin one...a great fit.  The color and quality of the cover is excellent.

0525478817|5.0|I only have praises for this book. I love how it's honest and heartwarming, and how the characters are witty and comical and engaging despite their difficult situations. I love that it's awkward like how teens should be with cancer thrown in the mix. It's profound without trying so hard to be. I just love it. Five damn stars!

B003VR5PPY|5.0|I am personally a huge puzzle game/visual novel lover. The puzzles in this game were somewhat easy for me. There were a couple that I found that almost made no sense as a puzzle (no hints, random guessing, really bleh). Most, however, were still really fun to play. The game features a replay of the rooms you beat through (this is great because you can unlock extra character that though won't give any more insight to the story, is still rather funny to read).<br /><br />Now, since I mentioned characters, one of my favorite aspects of the game is how the game manipulates you into thinking about stereotypes. Do these characters fall into what they seem or am I judging based off a cover? The reveal of this warps who you like and dislike almost every ending you get (there are six) and it's quite an exciting thrill when the true ending comes around.<br /><br />The story itself is this games highest point. It's mind blowing! We (My boyfriend and best friend) could not stop talking about it for weeks!! Though multiple cutscenes exceed 2 hours (not kidding), they don't ever feel like it. They are all interesting and engaging. And the music (awesome soundtrack by the way) adds so much intensity. My only issue with the cutscenes is that sometimes I feel like the sense of urgency disappears from time to time due to dialogue. It makes me wish some sort of timer was set for the puzzles so the feeling would be present during the entire gameplay. Losing minutes to nonsense talking would have made the conversations both important when the time came and aggravating when they occurred in the middle of a puzzle. Just my opinion though. I also wish you were able to view previous cutscenes, much like the replay of previous puzzles.<br /><br />The game does suffer from several spelling mistakes, plenty of sex jokes (very mild, never obscene), and the need to replay through rooms again can sometimes feel like a nag (there is a flash forward feature you can use though that stops the minute you get new dialogue, but you cannot skip puzzles). Despite these small discrepancies, the game is such a rush of emotions and really exciting. Once I got through my first playthrough, I could not put it down except for sleep. I recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Playthrough Time: 23 hrs and 14 minutes<br />Final Rating: 9/10you get new dialogue, but you cannot skip puzzles).

B0000667RO|3.0|A compilation is supposed to represent an artist's best and most well-known material, right? Well in that case, the title is misleading.<br /><br />The problem for me is actually the decision to include two of his old time rockers. By putting \\"Run to You\\" and \\"Summer of '69\\" in here for good measure, it suddenly puts the rest of the album in perspective, because they just happen to be the album's best songs.<br /><br />I know now that the album was supposed to contain his 90's hits and that it's actually named after the title track. But back then, neither me nor my dad knew it.<br /><br />When my dad found this disc in our local record store, he hadn't listened to Bryan Adams since he was a teenager, when he was a big fan of his. He had therefore forgotten a lot of the songs he loved back then, and was vastly disappointed when he put this disc on, only to hear flutes and violins, then recognize five songs and hear almost no rockers, or even \\"Heaven\\". These were not the songs he wanted to hear.<br /><br />That's why I don't like this collection. It's not called \\"The Best of the 90's\\" or \\"The Best of the Ballads\\", it's called \\"The Best of Me\\", as if this was a career-covering disc. It's not, and you can't expect casual fans to know that \\"The Best of Me\\" is merely a reference to a new song.<br /><br />You might ask why we didn't simply buy \\"So Far So Good\\" instead. Simple, this was the newest collection and all the stores sold this one, and we actually didn't know it existed, since I had barely heard any Bryan Adams songs at the time and my dad lost interest after \\"Waking Up the Neighbours\\".<br /><br />I more or less like all of these songs by themselves, but not when it's shoddily packaged together under an album title like this one. If they would have traded \\"Run to You\\" and \\"Summer of '69\\" in favour of \\"On a Day Like Today\\" and \\"Star\\" and add \\"There Will Never Be Another Tonight\\", \\"Tonight I'd Died and Gone to Heaven\\", \\"Fearless\\" and \\"Blues Jam\\", it would have beena great 90's compilation. Instead, it's just average.<br /><br />It's okay now, since we've now got \\"Anthology\\" and I'm more familiar with his discography. But back then, it was a disappointment, and since disc 2 of [the international release of] \\"Anthology\\" is just a little bit better than \\"The Best of Me\\", there is no real reason to buy this record, since you can buy the hidden track \\"Don't Give Up\\" by itself. (Unless you really want a blurry photo of Bryan Adams standing naked, that is, since \\"Anthology\\" doesn't have such a picture...)

Well elegant for me - I never wear heels - and these will look well-dressed with just about any outfit.  I think I will get in another color.

0375869026|5.0|I heard about Wonder in a review in the radio.  Purchased it for my 9 yr. old grandson.  I started glancing through it when it arrived. Found myself reading it. Could not put it down. Finished it the next day.  It was very touching.  Loved it. My grandson enjoyed it as well as he could not put it down.  We discussed it and he learned a lot from it.  My daughter-in-law does not want us to talk about the book in front of her because he wants to read it herself!  This is funny because she hates to read!!
B008K7WCJM|5.0|I'm going to start this right off by saying that I now fully believe Swans mastermind Michael Gira's statement that 'The Seer' took 30 years to make and is \\"the culmination of every previous Swans album and any other music I've made.\\" At first I thought he was being hyperbolic, but after two straight listens and four hours gone by, I'm pretty much exhausted and drained--physically and emotionally--like I'd just run the gamut of every conceivable emotion, including two or three that I never knew existed. Try \\"scared\\" yet \\"blissful.\\" Or \\"sad\\" yet \\"euphoric,\\" which seems like it makes no sense, but I can almost guarantee that if you listen with an open mind (for those of you who may be new to Swans) and just let the music take over, it will.<br /><br />And, like Gira, I'm not exaggerating. While I'm definitely a fan of a lot of his past work, I'm not a hardcore Swans fan who's predisposed to think everything he puts out is genius. In truth, I have to be in just the right mood for his music, and even then there's only so much I can take before I feel like lying down in the middle of a busy expressway, due to suddenly feeling yet another unique-to-Swans-emotion that goes a little something like this: \\"I'm an insignificant speck in this vast universe, so what's the point,\\" mixed with \\"horrified\\" and something a little like vertigo. Of course, even creating music that induces nihilism and dizziness takes tremendous talent, but still, it can wear on you.<br /><br />'The Seer,' though, is much more sprawling in its scope than even 1996's epic 'Soundtracks for the Blind,' both in its emotional content and its virtual myriad of musical styles. Sure, you'll find \\"depressing\\" here. Quite a bit, in fact. But then there are moments of nearly overwhelming beauty to counteract it, making the highs that much higher. While this album is instantly recognizable as being the product of Swans, it definitely breaks new musical ground while still nodding to the band's--and at times music ingeneral's--past.<br /><br />I'm not going to break the album down track by track, as it needs to be experienced fully in order to get the maximum effect. Suffice to say, you'll hear repetitious, skull-piercing riffs and drones that slowly morph into something else over time; ambient--yet tension-filled--Brian Eno-esque innerspace soundscapes; jazzy, almost Krautrockian post-rock; intense tribal rhythms; even a country-ish ballad in the Karen-O sung \\"Song for a Warrior.\\" Not to mention what may be the most beautiful, awe-inspiring song of Swans' career: the 19-minute \\"A Piece of the Sky,\\" featuring former member Jarboe's ethereal vocals.<br /><br />Gira's voice is in full-effect throughout the album: from near-angelic, to ominous, to straight-up primal, and everything in-between, with lyrics that can still be devastating, especially if one's in the right frame of mind. Throw in some cameos by Ben Frost, the husband and wife duo of Alan Sparhawk & Mimi Parker from Low, and the aforementioned Karen-O, and what you have is possibly the most ambitious, demanding, most exciting album of the year, in any genre.<br /><br />It's amazing to me that, at this late stage in his 30 year career, Gira's still getting better; musically, vocally, and lyrically. It's a rare thing indeed for an artist to still be peaking at 58 years-old. But 'The Seer' is, without a doubt, a work of art, and the best album of his career, imo. Maybe, in another couple years, this will be considered just his second-best, though it's hard to imagine anything topping this. But at this rate, it wouldn't surprise me if he keeps getting better for yet another 30 years. All I know is, we're all lucky to have him.

B005JE7WKI|5.0|This movie shows many ironies in life, and it goes together well.  Poor Tucker and Dave have to suffer for it though, but so do others in this horror/comedy.
B005NQ5LQ4|4.0|This movie is full of dense detailed wing chun. Each master spends a certain amount of time on how they utilize the skill. With wisdom and experience, knowledge is perfected. That is why Yip Man constantly improvised his approached with Wing Chun under every battle/spar. Each villain utilize a similar style. Certain scenes are  produced at a slower rate. It is my understanding that this allows the viewers to understand the methods of attack, to witness what arm is thrown and why. There are scenes that moved so fast that you might have to watch them twice. There are some who watch such movies as this not only for entertainment. but understanding. This movie delivered a solid story. For those interested in continuing the joy of watching this style on television, you will enjoy this film form beginning to end.
B0082GQ5HG|5.0|SINCE THE introduction of Jack Sparrow, we've come to realize the pirate way of life is a riotous mash-up of misadventure. This smart and funny animated claymation/CGI production from directors Peter Lord and Jeff Newitt, who also teamed up on \\"Chicken Run\\" (2000) and \\"Flushed Away\\" (2006), is a treat for anyone who loves a clever, good natured joke.<br /><br />That seems to be the pirate's biggest problem, their abiding trust and naiveté in an England beset by the Industrial Revolution, Darwinism and a mad Queen Victoria, who is representative of those with very rich appetites. Names are simple. The Pirate Captain, voiced by Hugh Grant - and you will never recognize him - longs to win the Pirate of the Year award, a feat that's defeated him for 20 years. His loyal crew - The Pirate with a Scarf a.k.a. No. 2, (Martin Freeman, \\"Sherlock,\\" \\"The Hobbit\\"), The Albino Pirate (Anton Yelchin), The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate (a woman disguised as a man voiced by Ashley Jensen), The Pirate Who Likes Sunsets and Kittens (Al Roker), and The Pirate with Gout (Brendan Gleeson) - do their best to help. But it isn't until they run into the actual theory-of-evolution Darwin, voiced by David Tennant of \\"Dr. Who,\\" that they discover they might have a chance at winning something ... even if it means the sacrifice of something they love.<br /><br />Bright moments abound. I caught an appearance by The Elephant Man right off, but didn't see Jane Austen until the second go. I'll bet there's more I missed. Could Conan Doyle or Charles Dickens be in a scene somewhere, too?<br /><br />There's good crossover between the Blu-ray, 3D Blu-ray and DVD discs among the extras. A commentary with Lord, Newitt and film editor Justin Krish is loaded with information, but seems dull, particularly compared with onscreen antics. I suspect it's a result of the dry, British wit going Sahara on us. \\"So You Want to be a Pirate\\" is a hoot with the Pirate Captain hosting his own late-night TV show, guestsincluded. Games include \\"Mr. Bobo's Flash Card Challenge\\" (Darwin's assistant, a monkey and another great character) and a DVD-ROM where kids can download activities and coloring pages on the DVD. There's an interactive game, \\"Pirate Disquise Dress-Up,\\" on the Blu-ray.<br /><br />Exclusive to Blu-ray is one of the best extras, an engaging making-of \\"From Stop to Motion\\"; a featurette on \\"Creating the Bath (tub) Chase Sequence\\"; and two short films from Peter Lord.<br /><br />Speaking of the Blu-ray - both picture and sound are reference quality GREAT. Color, depth, detail, contrast - it's all there for the HD connoisseur. The film is dialogue heavy, so most of the sound broadcasts front and center. It is also great; each voice - with accent - comes through clearly and distinctly. Comical effects abound, blending in perfectly. There's nothing to distract from the action. Highly recommended for everyone!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|WARNING-SPOILERS WILL BE IN THIS REVIEW<br /><br />I LOVED the first 2 books. Actually finished off the 2nd and 3rd in less than a day.<br /><br />I feel like the last half of book 3 was just thrown together<br /><br />I personally felt that since Katniss was Peeta's reason for being through the whole series, then she should of been the key to bringing him back.<br /><br />Instead, there really is no explanation to how he gets to the point of being able to stay/have children with her without ever wanting to kill her again..<br /><br />The happy ending wasnt to happy, since Katniss wasnt ever truly happy/safe.<br /><br />She spends most of the book hiding/crying/acting rather cowardly imo...Not quite the symbol I had in mind.<br /><br />My husband had the perfect line for Finnicks demise..Seems like the author realized it had been awhile since she killed anyone meaningful and was worried the readers would get bored! LOL I found this amusing since it mirrored the points in the actual games.<br /><br />All and all, the last half, easy, of book 3 seemed thrown together to me.. Without any true effort of a good closure.<br /><br />I also feel like Prim was killed because that was the defining factor in her deciding on Peeta rather than Gale..<br />Found that rather boring and well chicken scrap, to put it politely.<br /><br />I know she was wishy washy through the whole series, but having her decide not to pick him because she would never know if it was his bomb that killed her sister...blah.. I know in the end it also states he is basically to

B00123IATW|5.0|I'm going to keep this one brief because the album has already been discussed in detail by the many other fine reviewers on Amazon. I do have a point I'd like to make that I believe will influence your buying decision (assuming you are one of the few who doesn't already own this classic).<br /><br />The highs and lows of Yes...and prog rock in general...the mind-numbing precision and stomach-churning excess...can all be found RIGHT HERE.<br /><br />The STUDIO VERSIONS of the songs on this album are infinitely superior to ANY versions the band released in live formats later. Why? Because they felt that instead of the TIGHT and AMAZING versions here, the songs had to be used as a platform to \\"jam\\" (witness the wretched \\"guitar face\\" version of \\"Starship Trooper\\" from the Trevor Rabin edition of the band on \\"9012Live: The Solos,\\" where he prances around the stage like Nigel Tufnel and bassist Chris Squire attempts to stalk him like a cross between the Wolfman and Gene Simmons...talk about a performance that has NOT worn well over the decades)...<br /><br />...and the famous coda from that song, \\"Wurm,\\" is where it all becomes apparent.<br /><br />1). @ the 5:36 mark, Steve Howe introduces that mighty \\"Wurm\\" chord riff.<br /><br />2). Around the 6:00 mark you can hear Tony Kaye building a little keyboard swell behind him. Note that I didn;t say \\"Rick Wakeman starts spewing this noodly tweedly rambling little solo to blot Howe out.\\"<br /><br />3). Around 6:30, the precise, booming anchor of Chris Squire becomes increasingly prominent. Bruford is also VERY slowly working his way in. We also get introduced to this fuzzy, distorted riff that is STILL FOLLOWING THE MAIN RIFF.<br /><br />4). Around the 7 minute mark, Bruford is opening up, as is Kaye. They're starting to break free from the lock-step of the main riff but they are still 100% engaged in it. The whole band is just LOCKED AND LOADED.<br /><br />5). At 8:24, Howe's solo just EXPLODES...he's doing a power duet withHIMSELF...and ONE MINUTE LATER, they are ALL gone, melted into a fade-out that makes you IMMEDIATELY say \\"I need to play THAT one AGAIN.\\"<br /><br />I just described a FOUR MINUTE interlude from a band that would later become known for going on and on and on and on (\\"Tales from Topographic Oceans,\\" anyone?)...<br /><br />Maybe some day, when Jon Anderson has his health back and fences can be mended, THIS edition of the band will see fit to perform \\"The Yes Album\\" in its entirety, following in the footsteps of so many other bands who gave a nod to their roots and also their shining hour.<br /><br />Yes wasn't better before or after this album. In MOMENTS, maybe. In terms of a single ALBUM, this was the top of the MOUNTAIN, baby.<br /><br />Buy it NOW.
0307592731|1.0|save your money-profanity and bad language to the extreme.<br />not worth a match to set on fire. maybe good for litter box.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I thought it was going to be boring but its awsome you need to get it trust me it will be the best game you ever get if you get it be my friend my user name is haileyhilarey:)
030758836X|1.0|since this was #1 on fiction list, thought may be suitable for daughter to read.<br />Wrong. It is pure trash. read a few pages to see if appropiate. put pages in<br />bottom of bird cage
B00002SWEM|2.0|I'm sorry but I found the movie dull. The music was kind of dull and repetitive, most of the musicians, although clearly extremely talented, were past their prime (Would you go see an athlete who was in his 80s) and Ry Cooder comes off as alternately condescending and hero-worshiping.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|Please be aware that these episodes will NOT be the versions found on the DVD sets.  They will be the originally broadcast versions, missing quite a bit of footage that was added for the DVD release (some wonderful jokes, scenes, and moments).  Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing this set - I'd rather have DVD quality visuals and the full extended versions I am used to and love, rather than jarring missing footage.<br /><br />(To be fair, this set will show the episodes as originally intended, but I never watched them on TV when they aired originally, so for me, it is a deal breaker.)
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|wasn't aware this was a fled game when I got it but it is okay....enjoying it quite a bit.  would recommend it to most people.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like it. The interface is often a bit over cluttered and slows down my productivity with the app. It has, though, emerged as a good tool for hanging on to notes, web couplings, and other sundries for later use or incorporation into another medium. As such, it is more of a secondary tool than a primary productivity app for me. Appreciate its overall stability. Not as unpredictable in delivering on its designed functionality as other free apps tend to be.
B00845POUO|5.0|played the movie on Amazon. Download was quick and the quality was excellent. It's nice to have the movie available to play anytime anywhere.
0205632645|3.0|But this is not the real Strunk & White, which is now known as the \\"second edition\\".  This is the \\"fourth edition\\", with a lovely classic cover, but includes many questionable revisions by other people, whose advice is mixed at best.  Hunt down the second edition instead if you want to know what the excitement is about.
B003L77G6A|5.0|We are loving having this series right at our fingertips so we can watch them over and over and over. My husband is that kind of a geek, lovable like Leonard, and we can't wait for the next. We also plan to look into ordering the last episodes of the Dr. Who series starting with the ninth Doctor. I think that's the the doctor we are starting with. When we have extra money, we want to start from the beginning with Merlin also. Another wonderful program and we're so happy we can get what we want so easily, and inexpensively through Amazon. Beats waiting in lines at the book store. Thanks again.<br /><br />Coralie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wasn't sure if this would be something I would like to read, but it sure is! The writing is fantastic you can tell it is written by a woman!
B0053O89WY|5.0|My husband and I love this series and have been able to share it with my oldest son, who also loves the series. We've watched all four series now and can't wait for the last to become available. Sept just can't come soon enough.<br /><br />Thanks Coralie
0374275637|5.0|If you think you know the way you think, it's time to think again!<br />I had always considered myself a somewhat shallow thinker, with decision making that seemed more emotional and unconscious than others. Turns out I'm just like everyone else if Daniel is to be believed! Such a relief to know that you're not shallow and impulsive, or at least to know that even if you are, you're just the same as most other folks.<br />For those in communication and marketing, this book is a must read. It will make you question most of the basics on which your industry has traditionally been conducted. Daniel makes an extraordinarily complex subject understandable - even to us shallow thinkers!
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Love the song, and the download worked perfectly.  No problems playing it on my computer from the Amazon Cloud.  Haven't tried downloading it to a device yet.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella and really enjoyed this book.  Like her other books, she brings humor, a memorable character and of course, lots of romance. Keep them coming.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like this game but I can never stop playing!I think it is a great game to download.It is great for kids!
B0071XO8RA|1.0|A friend urged me to read this book. There were a few moments, just a few, which I found enjoyable. But the writing in my opinion is barely serviceable. And the plot was unoriginal.
B000000H42|5.0|It's funny how some people comment on King Diamond's vocal acrobatics or the Hammerfilm horror-schlock subject matter.  What, were they born yesterday (don't answer that--I feel old already!)?  I actually remember when MF were targets of the PMRC, and when (later, during his solo career) King would appear on Geraldo, politely holding his own against paranoid moral police types.  As far as this release goes, it stands on its own as a metal classic, and transcends all subgenres and subsequent trends.  It does this primarily because of top-notch, catchy songrwriting, bolstered by riffs carefully constructed to convey a creepy atmosphere, while remaining warm and memorable.  At bottom, DBTO is a love-letter to the '70's, and you can hear echos of old Judas Priest, UFO, Scorpions, Sabbath, Thin Lizzy (especially on the title track), and dozens of lesser-known heavy prog acts throughout the record. Every metal fan should have this in their collection; it's THAT enthralling, and has held up extremely well over the past three decades.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I have to agree with the other criticisms I've read. It's almost like  harlequin romance, an old-school bodice ripper, in its silly attention to clothing and so forth. Too soap-opera-y for me.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I would never recommend this book. The ending was horrible. There are too many other good books out there. Don't waste your time
B004JM8X5E|5.0|My Family loves this movie, every time we watch it,, Cant help but to feel good about Life and people,, Sit down with your family and make the popcorn and enjoy,,<br />Kids over 13
B00130VLZ4|4.0|This case is good in terms of quality, but it's somehow small. It should be made in a little larger size.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was exciting and fun.  I did not purchase this book thinking It was going to be the next great classic novel.  I purchased this book because I was told by friends that is was sexy and interesting, it met those expections.  I loved the books and they gave my husband and I of 14 years great ideas!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great features, well thought out and easy to use. I highly recommend the app. Visuals are perfect and easy to read.
B0070NSPCU|3.0|Not sure if those first FABULOUS reviews were from the author himself or his brothers & sisters, but I did not think the book was worth raving about.<br />It was ok.<br />Not sure if it was just MY kindle copy, or if it's everyone's, but it really pissed me off that it wouldn't fill the page.  It would stop at the end of a sentence, and often look like it was the end of a chapter or something, but when i switched to the next page, it was in the middle of a sentence !  I had to go back & forth several times to get the full page to show up.  And it happened over & over again !  The first kindle book i've had that's ever done that.  maybe it's me.<br />Anyway, back to the story - it was occasionally hard to follow, and i won't be bothering to get the next ones in the series.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Seems odd but I love this version more than the regular fruit ninja. The game runs flawlessly on my galaxy s2 android phone.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story line was interesting and the characters were believable. I was diappointed though with the ending. I felt it was not complete and it ended abruply. Their actions at the end were not aligned with how they were presented throughout the novel. I would not and have not reccommended this book to anyone.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Got this as a gift for a family member she loves it and it is such a great video. If you love Adele it's a must have
1452110581|5.0|This book is clever and hysterically funny.  I had pre-ordered 3 copies and now I'm ordering 3 more.  This is the only gift I'm giving this year.  I have 5 rescue cats, and they say they could pee on the book!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it, it is really helpful but annoying sometimes because when I plug in my charger it brings me in to the app and cancles what I am doing but other than that it is great no crashing or freezing on my kindle fire. Ok bye
B007BT0RKG|2.0|This app is a good idea in concept. The free version does not let you search however. instead users are prompted to upgrade. As for detail, I live in Port St. Lucie FL, and it would not show Cocoa Beach or Cape Canaveral. Not sure the paid version would be worth it.  I'll look toward something else. Uninstalled.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book!  I have often wondered myself what happens later! Am glad to know someone else did also and really glad it was Chris Colfer and he took the time to share with us!
B0075LTOR2|5.0|Although they never achieved the fame in the U.S. that they did in the U.K., Roxy Music remained an influential band with their art-rock/glam-rock approach. The band's first five studio albums are seminal while their last three studio albums range from decent to exceptional. This handsome boxed set collects the band's eight studio albums in handsome, thick, glossy gatefold mini-LP sleeves along with two CDs of the band's various b-sides, singles and various remixes. Although this set is missing previously unreleased tracks or outtakes, there are a number of releases on the last two CD set that make their debut in digital form for the first time.<br /><br />Although fans may argue over the merit of various releases (was the band better with or without Eno? Did Eddie Jobson's musical sophistication as a keyboard and violin player expand the band's musical sound), these are all worthwhile picking up for fans in this new remastering which goes back to the original analog sources. Reportedly these are \\"flat\\" transfers that represent the sound of the mastertapes more accurately than any other release and while I can't attest to how these compare to the master tapes, these are probably the BEST representation of how the band sounded.<br /><br />These releases sound exceptionally good--they are not brick walled,  not peak limited, compressed nor has there been any attempt to fatten up the bass sound or the introduction of any strange EQ choices. The albums are presented as intended (and, in the case of \\"Manifesto\\" features the original album line up--the original CD release included the single version of \\"Angel Eyes\\" and a different take of \\"Dance Away\\" that were substituted for the original tracks) IMHO these best the UK original E.G. releases as well as the Warner/Reprise CD reissues AND Bob Ludwig's remasters from 1999. The sound is warm and analog-like (which is ironic in our digital age given these albums were produced without ever thinking about how they would sound digitally). The transfers are top notch throughout.  What we get here is as close to the original sound as the band intended for these releases. The labels feature the original album cover graphics on the CD labels.<br /><br />Is this set perfect? For fans who want a booklet detailing the recording of the various albums along with lyrics and details on the mastering of this edition the answer would be no. Also, the original release was to include DVD higher resolution releases of ALL the band's albums and b-sides. This was scaled back to this set here and, while those things are missed, as mentioned these are the ultimate redbook CD editons of the albums.<br /><br />Fans looking for accurate reproductions of the LP sleeves including the inner lining should be aware that these are ALL gatefold sleeves (only the first three were released on LP in gatefold sleeves)and the inner sleeves are color coordinated to the release but blank (\\"Country Life\\", \\"Flesh + Blood\\" and \\"Avalon\\" all included the original lyrics for each release on the inner sleeve something not reproduced here). The gatefolds do have outtake photos from the cover sessions included on the inside (some of which appeared on the boxed set [[ASIN:B0000073GP Thrill of It All]]).<br /><br />The CD of outtakes, b-sides and remixes include the following tracks (collecting everything that the band released during their lifetime--The version of \\"India\\" included on \\"The Thrill of It All\\" on the fourth disc is not a unique mix but the album version and is not included here as a result):<br /><br />Virginia Plain 3:00 (This was not on the original LP release in the UK but a stand alone single)<br />The Numberer 3:42<br />Pyjamarama [Island Mix]  3:03<br />Pyjamarama [Polydor Mix] 2:54<br />The Pride and the Pain 4:16<br />Do the Strand [USA 7\\" Mix] 3:23<br />Hula Kula 2:39<br />Your Application's Failed  4:45<br />The Thrill of It All [Edit] 4:22<br />The Thrill of It All[USA 7\\" Mix]  3:25<br />Love Is the Drug [USA 7\\"Mix] 3:00<br />Sultanesque  5:26<br />Both Ends Burning [7\\" Mix]  4:01<br />For Your Pleasure 5:04 (live version b-side to \\"Both Ends Burning\\" single)<br />Trash 2  3:11<br />Dance Away [7\\" Version] 3:50 (This version was the original mix on the US release and differs slightly with a different mix)<br />Dance Away [Canadian Extended 12\\" Mix]  6:31<br />Angel Eyes [7\\" Version] 2:53 (This is the single  version which eventually replaced the album version in the UK)<br />Angel Eyes [12\\" Version] 6:38<br /><br />Oh Yeah [7\\" Version]  4:15<br />Manifesto [Remake] 4:02<br />South Downs 5:24 (The version on the Thrill of It All CD was mastered in error in reverse)<br />Lover  4:29<br />Jealous Guy 6:12<br />To Turn You On [1981 B-Side Version]  4:13 (This version features a slightly different and earlier mix of the song)<br />More Than This [7\\" Version]  4:35<br />Avalon [7\\" Version] 4:16 (This version features a different mix on the vocals that was previously only available on the original single)<br />Always Unkowing 5:21<br />Take a Chance with Me [7\\" Version) 3:40<br />Take a Chance with Me [USA 7\\" Mix] 2:47<br />The Main Thing [12\\" Single Version]7:44<br />The Main Thing [Remix]<br /><br />This is an exceptional set and collects all the albums, singles, single mixes, b-sides and remixes issued during the band's career.

B001CDLAT4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but I kept waiting during the 'credits' for an aknowledgement of the first in this genre, namely the 1983 KOYAANISQATSI Life Out Of Balance, with music by Philip Glass.  Ron Fricke was also involved in the prior film.  Just wish he had paid homage to that film.
B008WHTFL8|3.0|The first Darkness album (Permission to Land) was on my playlist for a long while.<br />I don't know if it's the passage of time, but this one sounds ok but just about that.<br />Most of the songs are an enjoyable listen, but I had to drop Every Inch of You (too screamy) and Street Spirit (Fade Out) - the most horrible cover I have ever heard.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|terrible enough said after reading this book i want to take every copy of it i can find and go to town
B0086700CM|5.0|my opinion is its realy fun for my brother and I like it but it's. not for everybody.Make sure you try it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game for all ages. Warning : It may become your next addiction. I would have paid for this game but it has in app purchases instead. Too bad for the developers though, its easy to just earn your own coins intead of buying with real money.
0767817478|5.0|Godzilla is the best movie in the series. Our hemisphere has really turned it into a great feature. This is the closest to a great gargantuan movie anybody can get to. The film explains that they thought Godzilla was a dinosaur, but that theory is quickly tossed out as the protagonist explains the effect of radiation. This movie is a classic with great CGI. Anybody who doesn't like this, and suggests the Japanese versions, is merely afraid of progress.
1423101464|5.0|I got my oldest who reads a ton to try this series out.  He read the whole series in no time and everything he has read by Riorain he just loves!  Nice set of chapter books for older elementary/middle school (my son reads on a 7-8th grade reading level, but was in 4th when started reading these).  Other boys must love them too, because it is a pain to find them at the library.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I love Liam Neeson and can't wait for Taken 2 to come out, but The Grey was the biggest waste of time and money I think I've ever spent. I wish there was a negative number of stars I could give it!<br /><br />I see a lot of movies and am not someone who is looking for an Academy Award winning performance, just something entertaining so you can lose yourself for a couple of hours. I don't want to give away too much for those who are willing to see it to form their own opinion, but both my husband and I sat there waiting for \\"the good part\\" only to find out that in this movie, \\"the good part\\" is the credits at the end of the movie.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|As close to historical facts as I know it.  A great tribute to our men and women who have served and are currently serving!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was different from Stephen King's usual heavy-on-horror fare. The time travel aspect was really interesting, and there was plenty of suspense to keep me turning the pages. If you are interested in Oswald, or the Kennedy assassination, you'll enjoy the detail to history as well. It's clear that King did a lot of research on Oswald. I enjoyed how King fleshed out Oswald's personality, and his relationships with his family. There's a nice parallel story about the narrator's own journey and experiences too. I highly recommend this book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|It has been a month since I read Gone Girl and I still get goosebumps thinking about it.  I've recommended it to a lot of people.  Everyone loves it.

034580404X|4.0|Fifty Shades Trilogy: Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker, Fifty Shades Freed 3-volume Boxed Set [Paperback]<br />is the way to go so that when you finish one on to the next one.  It's a non stop type read.I must say the books are diffently as good as talked about and worth the money.  The set is a great value.  .  I'm on book two and I am enjoying the read.
034580404X|5.0|WOW, AWESOME, Loved these books Once you start reading them they are hard to put down. Well worth the money and an Awesome read. I would recommend these to anyone who loves to read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like it cause you get to make a village and call what ever like. My name is Rosemary .
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved the first 2/3 of this book. I thought it was ingeniously written, had me guessing what would happen next at every twist and turn. But the end of the book is oh-so-disappointing.<br /><br />The reader is left hating both Nick and Amy, feeling like Nick really IS the douchebag husband he was supposed to be all along, and Amy is a vile and petulant and psychotic as ever. And then it just ENDS. With NOTHING. It doesn't even leave you wanting more, it just leaves you feeling unsatisfied and sour.<br /><br />The one major thing I think the author overlooked is a LIE DETECTOR TEST. Why wouldn't the investigation have submitted Nick to a lie detector? Surely he would have agreed, considering the circumstances (I won't give too much away here). I know lie detectors aren't 100% accurate or anything, but it would have definitely been helpful to his case, you'd think his \\"amazing\\" lawyer would have suggested it right away! Odd.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't believe the hype about this book. It is as though the author literally got bored with these two terrible characters, the same way the reader eventually will, and abandoned ship in the middle of a paragraph. Not worth the 400-something pages, or your time.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book was absolute rubbish. I only downloaded it because I heard so many people tlking about it and kept eading about it. It was merely a description of 2 people having sex.  Very boring!
B004GEB9UQ|5.0|I have done several diiferent 'low carb' diets over the years and have successfully lost weight on each.  This is different because I have made a lifestyle change and this is the way I am eating now.  Joint pain and swelling no longer existed after two weeks on the diet.  I no longer have acid reflux.  It was totally eliminated when the gluten and wheat were removed from my diet.  I am losing between 2.5 to 4 pounds a week.  I lost 15 pounds in the first month and feel great.

B004YM6JLO|5.0|I am liking this show more and more with each season. Very entetaining. Not so teeny bopper. Highly recommended to all.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|What a ride.  Part of me hated this book but the rest of me thought it was hilarious/stunning.  I can't believe how the book just sucks you in and doesn't let go until the finish the 3rd book and then you get mad that you read it so fast.  Yet, I think it would have been a better book if all 3 had been combined and about 1/3 of it cut out.  At times it was a little too much.  Anyhow, not bad for a first book.
B0053O89WY|5.0|One of the funniest and best shows on network television hands down. Every episode is comical genius. Highly recommend to all audienes.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|Senna was a gifted individual not only as F1 driver but spiritually. The producers of this movie have done such a superb job putting old footages of Senna together that you forget this documentary was made in 2010, some ten years after Senna's death. It is a very emotional, touching story about a superb driver with certain beliefs. The interviews at the end of the DVD are a testimony to the unique story and existence of an individual by the name of Senna even after his death. Although this is about Senna in F1, the reality is that it is about Senna, the human being in F1, not F1. A must see production. Unbelievable, emotional, gripping true story. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|It's 1965 and three young, and highly talanted Mossad agents go to East Berlin to kidnap a Nazi war criminal. The plan is to bring him back to Israel where he will have a public trial that will expose his crimes to the world. The plan goes bad and the mission is less than a total success. But the three agents return home, to Israel, as national heroes.<br /><br />Flash forward to 1997 and the three Mossad agents, still national heroes, need to deal with a few messy entanglements that remain from their 1965 mission. Very messy entanglements, that is.<br /><br />The movie plays out on two levels. One is a top flight spy thriller. The second is as a top flight morality puzzle. How far should, and will, one, or in this case three, go to clean up a few very messy entanglements. How much does one person owe to him or herself, and to others, to tidy up a very unpleasant pile of muck.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few plot points that are less than realistic, but they are necessary to make an interesting movie. If you want total reality join the Mossad and go on a mission.
1401216676|4.0|The art in BTKJ is the shining point for me personally, but the story comes in second by a hair.I have always heard about TKJ from reviews in the comic book world, and just recently read it.When I began reading it, a bit of a ways into it I wasnt sure how to process it.This problem doesnt happen very often when Im reading a book.The joker has in recent years puzzled me more and more, hes a character I cant wrap my head around for obvious reasons, but as we all know thats the beauty of the character.TKJ was written by the great Alan Moore and  finely illustrated by Brian Bolland and originaly colored by John Higgins.In the new deluxe edition however Bolland has now recolored the whole book and looks much more clear and sharp compared to the original.For me as of now TKJ is a fine read and should be read by any comic book fan.
B0000DG00B|5.0|I had been looking for recordings of the Atlanta Pop Festival for years when I found the Allman Brothers cd. My heart jumped seeing the cd artwork which was based after the free poster of the event I got when I ordered my tickets for the festival. I remember the Allman Brothers opening the festival. It was about 1:00 in the afternoon on July 3rd and HOT . We found a place to sit on the grass under some pecan trees for some shade. The thing I remember the most of the first set they played was when the rain started during Mountain Jam. Everyone uplugged their guitars walked off stage to get out of the rain except Butch and Jaimoe, the drummers. I could be wrong, it was over 40 years ago when I was 19, but as I remember it, they continued with their drum solo for 15-20 minutes in the rain until the rain stopped and then the rest of the band came back on and finished the song. There was no break, they played nonstop. It was the most amazing thing I have ever seen in live rock. When I got the cd, Mountain Jam, July 3rd was the first song I listened to but was disappointed to hear that they had edited to song.<br />The ABB was so unique with dueling drummers and guitar players. I had seen them 5 times while Duane and Berry where alive and albums like this and Fillmore East are gems forever allowing us to remember how it was during the early days of the ABB.
B003XQ2VOG|5.0|All these movies in this pack are great. Fantastic voyage stands out as the movie where I remember seeing Donald Pleasance and he was scary! And Rachel Welch, wow! Great scary story. Almost as good as the book!
0470901071|4.0|This book is really well written and it does keep you interested. however!<br /><br />You really will need another book to supplement your CCNA studies in my opinion.. I don't think this book goes far enough in to some of the topics. It was good to use along with the Cisco Press books since the way that some concepts are explained in this book are easier to understand than in the Cisco Press books.
B0088X7YU0|2.0|I love the Starship Troopers series. I was on it since I watched them filming the first one out here by my place in the 90s. This one is so disappointing. I was willing to give an animated sequel a shot, but it isn't even good animation. The entire thing looks and feels like a seriously bad \\"Halo\\" cut scene, straight out of 10 years ago. Save your money, you'll be happier if you just stick with the trilogy.
B00785P2QC|3.0|i like it but as i said before it will cost you to much. i myself didnt buy anything and i got off to a very slow start so i have you are a spoiled person 'cause you are gonna need money.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|I heard Ludovico Einuadi's music on a Tide commercial and had to find out who was playing and HAD TO GET IT!!  All of his music is great and was an excellent buy....you will not be disappointed if you get it!!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this movie, and my tv offers the zoom out option, so the fit wasn't a problem. This really is my feel good movie. Something about belting out \\"Lets Go To The Movies\\" brightens my day.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|Detoured to Bethel NY to visit the site of the Woodstock festival.  The hillside where the concert occurred is still there and preserved in honor of this seminal event.  There's a Woodstock museum there now and an amphitheater for concerts is adjacent to where the 1969 festival was held.  After seeing the place, I had to get the video.  I just wish I would have been old enough to go.  Three days of peace and music and nothing but peace and music...  Thank you Mr. Yasgur!
1936608898|5.0|This book truly inspires change in eating habits! The beginning sections explain how your food choices are impacting your health (knowing the specifics always helps me in times of weakness!). Then each food to be eliminated is thoroughly explained. There are also unconventional recipes which are more like guides than actual recipes, which are great for variety and ease! This is not a glossy, color-filled book, but it sure gets the job done!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|download is fast. has a few bugs but correctible with updates. great for children to learn hand eye coordination. love to use it at doctors office when I have to wait.
0345803485|3.0|I am a 16 year old that enjoys classic novels and to a lesser extent, historical fiction and romance. However, I am always willing to read popular works, regardless of author or genre. As with many people my age, I disliked Twilight and went through an \\"OMG the Hunger Games is so awesome!!\\" phase. Popular works have always been something I go for just to see if they are really worthy of the hype they receive. Then I read 50 Shades of Grey. It may sound extremely dim-witted but I hardly knew anything about it when I picked it up. It had a sleek cover, and a blurb that sounded like the ultimate dark love fantasy. The ambiguous winky faces that so often came up on Facebook/Twitter whenever this work was discussed only piqued my curiosity. I should have known better...I suppose.<br /><br />The simple style of writing assured me it would be an easy read, the undeniable attraction and tension between Christian and Anastasia drew me in. Then Christian opened the door to his `playroom'. However, once I absorbed this (my typical adolescent curiosity driving me to finish at least the first book in this trilogy.) it was far less troubling. As the book progressed, I found it to have a pretty engrossing plot about a girl torn between a `normal' life she always expected to lead and an unconventional, bizarre lifestyle that she did not even know existed. The twisted, tormented romance between Ana and Christian was delightfully dark and intriguing.<br /><br />Admittedly, Anastasia is a character I liked very little and the repetitive writing style leaves a lot to be desired. Grammatical mistakes are ever present and there are only so many times one can read the same line over and over before it loses all effect and meaning. A Thesaurus would have been a very useful investment. For an author, James's vocabulary does not appear to be very expansive. I mean, `sardonic' is a pretty good word but the amount of times it's used to describe Christian's smile is positively maddening!  And why, oh why does Anastasia have to bite her lip that much. It's almost like a weird pesky habit.  Also, there were pretty blatant inconsistencies (for want of a better word) in the general plot. That Christian is a self made billionaire even before he had reached his 30's I can sort of accept as not being 100% outside the realms of possibility (I mean it is fiction, right?)  but in the book, his job is almost never mentioned. Christian makes being a CEO of a giant company look like a regular 9-5 job...heck, not even that. If running a (relatively new, I am assuming) billion dollar company consists of just taking the occasional phone call then I really see why it's such a dream job.  I will not go into much more detail, but it's mainly these flaws in characterisation, style and basic grammar, not the sex, that makes this book no better than three stars in my opinion.<br />The sex is excessive, but to my surprise it was perfectly integral to the story. It weaves almost seamlessly into the plot, so much so that it made me believe that the effect would be the same without it. Some people's complaints about the book having `so much sex' and being `so dirty' and `disturbing' are pretty unfounded considering it's a work of erotic fiction. And along with that, it is about BDSM; for a popular, bestselling work that is a rare, risky topic. But 50 Shades of Grey without the sex would be like a crime novel without anyone actually committing any criminal acts, it would simply not work. From a personal point of view, I did not enjoy reading the scenes with overly unusual acts, they unnerved me at times. This however was from lack of preparation and knowledge and not from some kind of artistic flaw in the work.<br /><br />In conclusion, 50 Shades of Grey is far from an ideal, delightful little novel that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. However, that was never its purpose and just because it has become popular does not mean it is for absolutely everyone. It deserves praise forits good features just as much as contempt for its faulty writing and other flaws aforementioned. So I decided not to go one way or the other and settled for the comfortable, median rating of 3/5 stars. What I learned (aside from the ...ahem... the obvious details about BDSM that I really did not need to know) is that I should do my research before jumping on the bandwagon because sometimes it can lead me in some very peculiar directions.  Personally, as a whole this book wasn't really for me, even though I finished it.... And had I known more I doubt I would have picked it up in the first place. That's pretty much it, not the most authoritative opinion but I hope a clearly expressed one.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a pretty great series.  I kept getting to points and thinking \\" I know whats going to happen\\" and it never was as I guessed which made for a great original story.  Thanks for the time you put into this story, I'll read more if you keep writing them!
0515149489|5.0|I have always had at least one dog underfoot. It was nice to read about something I could really relate to by Nora (my absolute fave!) If you are not a dog lover this book is probably not for you, although it's about much more than that.  How there are search and rescues, woman talks, a stalker and irrisistable Simon (yum) Nora really covers all bases. I enjoyed this book so much I wanted to share my first review with everyone!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is great for road trips and when you don't have an internet connection that is needed for almost all other games. I would recommend this to anyone.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|its very good! i like thst thry give u different patterns! the only thing i would like to see different is for me to be able to change the tiles.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|awesome brain teaser. I really love how it challenges me to find new ways of seeing the same puzzle. I would definitely recommend this app to my friends!!
1589946634|5.0|The game is extremely addictive and fun, thank you Fantasy Flight for creativity and thank you Amazon for availability I can't wait to try and purchase more.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has a very addictive game play. evolving missions keep the User involved. also, in game purchases available but not at all necessary
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its basically just a cute little remake of mario bros. Fun without being overly challenging plus its free. Good game overall :)
B00000G3I2|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best movies ever made.  The Big Chill is a classic for sure.  The ongoing friendship of the characters is one to be envied.  Would suggest that anyone that wants to be entertained with just superb acting and entertainment that does not include violence and chaotic events throughout will find this very refreshing.  You will want to watch this movie again and again!!!!!!<br /><br />Definitely do yourself a favor and see this movie.
B005FJ7DOM|3.0|It was a pretty good movie rental.. I won't go out a buy it but it was pretty good and worth the few bucks to rent.

B005OJTVAW|1.0|I made the mistake of only looking at the 5 star reviews. I saw they far outnumbered the 1 & 2 star reviews, I just don't understand how.  This cover is truly nothing more than covered cardboard. The front cover arrived warped and the inside had some substance all in it that I couldn't wipe clean.  This product offers NO protection for the Kindle other than to protect the screen from scratches.  I can't believe I paid $25 for this total waste of a product. It's on its way back!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app although it needs wi-fi.<br />and it can read to you that's soo cool.<br />I love it
B0074MTTEK|5.0|It's difficult to explain why epigenetics is such an important subject and even harder to make sense of it when you, like me, have no science background.  Fewer subjects however, have greater implications for our future health than the amazing discoveries in  the field of epigenetics.  A short example:  The author discusses a laboratory experiment where lab rats are \\"altered\\" so as to act as if they had mental retardation; they are then \\"cured\\".  Sounds impossible? sure. Was it done?  you betcha.  A possible cure for people with MR?  yeah, possibly and people with drug addictions and people with cancer,etc. etc.<br /><br />This is not to say that these \\"cures\\" are right around the corner and even with the developments in this field of epigenetics, we probably won't see these cures in my  life time but it's a very exciting field.<br /><br />Briefly, Dr. Carey describes how this phenomenon was even discovered.  Mapping the human genome in the 1990's was expected to yield a \\"map\\" of over 300,000 genes but less than a third of that was actually discovered and \\"mapped.\\"  so  how do we explain how identical twins, with identical DNA, produce one child with extraordinary gifts and another with learning disabilities. Enter the world of epigenetics.  If you are at all interested in public  health, or criminal justice or any field where you have to explain the human condition or its future, this book is a must read.  Buy  it, steal it, do whatever you have to do but please read it.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I think the best part of this is that I can get it free and it is a awesome game that takes a little long to play. But it still is really good. :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I did like this book, was very easy reading. I did have my moments on the immaturity of the character that made me cringe. The writing style is somewhat juvenile, but that is what the character Ana was supposed to be.  Overall I was entertained!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's a pretty cool game and I'm surprised that it was free.  It sure seems like a lot of work was put into it because it plays well and stays fun. Definitely worth a download.
B008MEM24S|5.0|love it love it love it love it llve it love it love it. tuesday love it love it<br />like it love it
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|that all there is but its free so cant really bit@h 2 much about it. I need 5 more word's
B008S4YZCO|1.0|This game looks cool, at first, being that it's 3D. Unfortunately there is nothing truly special beyond that quality. It is the same Facebook styled game, but with fancy graphics. Almost the exact same gameplay coupled with the same outrageous prices and limitations. It may be cool or interesting at first but, those feelings will quickly ware off as you get settled into the same rythem as any other Facebook game.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|it was great but then after level 20 it just got boring as hell would have keep it but started acting buggy
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was written so well I love how it makes you need to read the whole series and just flows right in. this series is worth every minute and penny u spend on it couldnt stop reading, must have!!
0553593714|5.0|\\"Game of Thrones\\" is the first book in George R.R. Martins \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series.  It is also a series on HBO which has so far covered the first two books.  That is how I was introduced to the novels, and actually watched the series on TV before starting in on the first book.  In my opinion they both the TV series and the novels are excellent, and are written in a very different style than your typical fantasy epic.  The characters are gritty and their intentions are not necessarily good or evil, but like real people depend greatly upon the psychology and history of the individual.  The Starks and the Lannisters, two powerful houses are essentially the primary adversaries in this first book, although there are many other houses which complicate matters in the realm.  Above them all the King of Westeros tries to maintain his hold on all seven kingdoms.  This may all sound like typical fantasy writing, but you will soon realize that things are very different in this new world.  Martin writes in a unique style as well, at least one that I have not seen very often.  Each chapter is written from the viewpoint of a certain character, there are maybe 5 or 6 in \\"Game of Thrones\\", and we see the plot unfold from the eyes of various people throughout the world.  Each chapter title is the name of whichever character we are following, probably to make it easier as the number of viewpoints increases.  I found both the books and TV show to be captivating and quite interesting, and I cannot wait for the next season to come out in the fall.  There are many twists and turns, many of them completely unexpected by the reader, and be forewarned, no character is safe from death, even those who seem to be indispensable.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the genre, and even those who aren't will likely enjoy this new twist on the fantasy novel.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love it! helps me fall asleep on my most restless night.  I &agrave;m even gonna use it for meditation.  I would like to manipulate the sounds a little more though.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game I cant stop playing to save my life keeps you wanting more great time with my younger children also....good job guys
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. It's sweet. Every night I use it to relax. With all the choices I can feel I'm Oceanside,  camping. the best is the relaxing humming of a lullaby....great for kids with moms that work nights. Deserves 5 star.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's a game with a lot of fun in it. I can't belive its free!!! You must get this game!! It is so much fun!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I just finished the third book last night and I'm already wanting more! I absolutely loved all three books with the second being my favorite. Yes, there is plenty of sex but so is there in real life. I think many of the people that say there is no storyline probably could not get past the fact that there is sex in these books in order to look past it and see the other things going on (there is a definite storyline).<br /><br />There are also a lot of other things that happen that will keep you wanting to read more to find out how the situation turns out. Most of the crazy things that really pulled me in were in the second book which is why it was my favorite though they continue through the third.<br /><br />I absolutely fell in love with Christian and Ana's characters, it was just nice to read a romance that included some real life problems instead of only being about how in love they are. The repetition people complain about stems from who these characters are, I did not see it simply as repetition, but rather keeping the characters personalities. Just as with real people Ana and Christian have certain expressions that they use, to me that's not repetition so much as just who the characters are.<br /><br />Bottom line: I loved everything about these books. I DO NOT have one complaint and would recommend them to anyone grown up enough to see past the sex to who the characters are. I started out not knowing if they would be for me, but they have become my new favorite books.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I have this app on my sgs2 and hp touchpad ics.  works well on both. but I don't understand...the IPad version has so many bonus screens..this version doesn't...and now is boring.  I have achieved the same levels and much higher score on my android...so why aren't those extra screens available?  sounds like shoddy development... I'm sick of development just for iPad....what you are not talented enough to develop better in android?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A fantastic read!  Very difficult to put down.  So happy I have a Kindle so once I finished one book, I could just jump right into the next and not have to wait until I got home to start the next. Definitely kept my heart racing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wish I had the right words to describe this book, because it goes way beyond amazing! There has not been another book series that has sucked me in the way this series has. I re-read the first two books THREE TIMES just to by pass some time while I waited for this book.<br /><br />I couldn't have asked for a better ending to this wonderful story! I loved everything about it. There were those WOW, jaw dropping moments, a few watery eye moments, and of course those eye rolls (how I wish Christian was around me for those!!!!)! I'm going to miss Christian and Ana, but know they are just a click away or walk away (I had to buy them in paperback too!!) when needed!<br /><br />E L James- You are such a great, talented writer and by far one of my favorite authors! You did such an amazing job with this story and told it well. I cannot wait for what else comes our way from you. I just hope we don't have to wait too long! And please, don't change a thing with your writing style. I LOVE IT!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Gray is a book that keeps you interested in reading more and more.<br />It is exciting, full of action and drama, liberarily spiced with vivid sex scenes.<br />You become interested in the main persons and wonder what is going to happen to them next. Yours eyes fly over the pages so quickly that you will have to read the book again to get all the details absorbed.<br />Good reading. Have fun.<br /><br />Hilma Elisabeth
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this book last September, and realized I have yet to leave an amazon review, so here it is!<br /><br />One word- AMAZING! This book was so amazingly good, if not way better than the first! I stayed up all night reading as each chapter left me wanting more. After I forced myself to go to sleep, I found my self waking up way too early just to finsih the book! It's all that was on my mind! I cannot wait for third book!! The second book ended with my jaw hanging open!!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I came across this book last April as a suggestion through my kindle.  I kept by passing it, until one night last August I decided to buy it.  I had no idea going in what to expect out from this book, and fell in love the moment Ana stepped into Christian Greys office!  I remember staying up all night to read and finish this book.  Then, was sad I read it so fast, that I re-read it. I came into work telling all my co-workers about it.  I Loved this book and series so much I purchased them all in paperback as well!!<br /><br />This book wasn't at all what I expected it would be- it was much much more!<br /><br />Thanks E.L for bringing Mr. Grey into my life!!

B0074JOCIG|3.0|Joe is a talented guitarist and if you like musical fusion, then Joe Bonamassa Beacon Theatre is for you. The reason I purchased this DVD was because I really liked his CD with Beth Hart, but had I realized his solo performances combined so many styles of music, I wouldn't have bought it.  He's obviously good on each song, but his music wasn't distinct enough for my untrained ear to fully appreciate.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Ryan and Denzel are the perfect match in this movie.  Ryan can drive a car; that's for sure...Denzel is unmatched as a covert agent...Please watch this film.
B005KDJCE2|5.0|If you know Airbag's debut album \\"Identity\\" then probably you already know what to expect from their new release \\"All Rights Removed\\". This fantastic album is an another step forward and it's more mature than debut release. It contains only 6 tracks with suite \\"Homesick 1-3\\" that lasts over 17 minutes. Last 3 tracks are unbelievably beautiful with pretty dark instrumental \\"Light Them All Up\\". I've heard a lot of comments comparing \\"All Rights Removed\\" to some of the Pink Floyd' albums but to be honest Airbag creates their own music style which is quite difficult to describe. That is one of the best, if not really the best, albums of 2011. Highly recommended.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was not a fan of the books until I saw the HBO series.  This is a great and inexpensive way to catch up with the story.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was my least favorite of Gillian Flynn's work.  I did not find it shocking, in fact I found it to be quite predictable.  Gillian did crank up the crazy in a disfunctional marriage a little bit, but overall I was disappointed.  Gillian has a wonderful imagination and a true talent for writing in stream of conciousness form, because of this I still enjoyed reading the book.  Sharp Objects is my favorite and, in my opinion, much better than Gone Girl. Sharp Objects explored some very interesting and not often discussed affilictions of the mind.  The family dynamics and character interactions were far better developed and more deserving of the \\"twisted\\" summation bestowed most commonly to Gone Girl.  Dark Places was a good read as well.  I agree with most other readers that the revelations of what happened \\"that night\\" just didn't quite fit.  In hindsight, Gillian set up the conclusion very early on, but it was a disapponiting conclusion similarly to Gone Girl.  Regardless, I have enojyed reading her books.  Gillian has a unique stlye and her characters, though most are not very likeable, are very well developed and very \\"real\\".  All three books were fantastic, right up until the end.  Although Sharp Objects is the only book that really delivered, I will continue to read Gillian's books and look forward to her next release.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This gun is so awesome! I have been in multiple Nerf wars and it has NEVER jammed! This is great because it is a semi-auto gun and you need it to be consistent unlike the Vulcan, which jams all the time...<br /><br />The only problem with it is that it comes with 4 clips and 24 bullets, because Nerf wants you to buy the other clips and bullets, so I did and it is even better! get this gun!
0618918248|5.0|Richard Dawkins has a way of breaking down complex ideas and ideologies and stating them in simple layman terms. And that, I appreciate about him and his writing style. This book, from cover to cover, I basically couldn't put down until I finished the last chapter of it. Highly recommended if you've seen his interviews and are looking for more thought provoking material.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|This is the best offering from King in a long time.  Perhaps helped by the advice about the ending which he admits was given to him by his son who writes under the name Joe Hill.  A thumping good read which doesn't just fizzle out like many of King's books
B008AWBQGW|1.0|This latest offering adds nothing new to the Skynyrd legacy; the subjects and lyrics I've heard all before.  Songs such as Home Grown, Mississippi Blood, Good Teacher and Honey Hole from a lyrical standpoint sound as if they were written by some teenagers.  For the next album, the band should consider bringing in some outside writers.  In summary, good musicians + bad material = bad album.
B008OP32M6|5.0|a lot went into this machine. there are two motors a servo that it is all built around, the battery box and a energy splicer (for lack of another name). there are (they say) just over 1300 pieces, but my brother says there are that many blue pins in it.<br /><br />this has taken me over a week to build as i have other things in life to do and i don't spend hours building lego. it is fun, and easy if you follow the directions. there are a few places (at least for me) where i didn't follow exactly and made mistakes, so while building this do follow directions, taking it apart when you notice 30 steps later that you need a part you accidentally placed somewhere it didn't belong is not fun<br /><br />there are a lot of gears in this. the servo turns the machine in circles and the motors spinning the tires and the way they did the gearing is absolutely fantastic. they even have differentials on it so left and right sides spin separately.<br /><br />there are two sets of bags, like most new legos come in....1 and 2. ny brother and i spent a half a hour sorting into colors and not worry about the bag numbers. Number 1 is for the chassis and number 2 is for the top. when you get to the top you are seriously almost done. there are three books and the first two are all for<br />the chassis.<br /><br />there are a LOT of colors and a lot of tiny pieces and a lot of pieces i have never seen before. this is truly a lego collector item, i highly recommend it, but get it from Lego. Amazon's prices start at $30 - $40 higher

I've read a couple of his fiction offerings and enjoyed them for the most part. Maybe he should stick to fiction. Actually though, when you consider his success story as told by the NY Times, this ebook is a work of fiction.<br />Uke Jackson

0062183591|3.0|Dan Ariely entertains while teaching. That's not such a bad thing. But I like more substance and less fluff. Cotton candy tastes good, but meat and potatoes makes a better meal.<br /><br />In his book The Honest Truth about Dishonesty, Dan Ariely describes his research and tells stories (some about himself, and some about others) focusing on honesty. While entertaining enough, there is little to chew on here. Dan Ariely tries to connect his research to bigger themes like the fraud at Enron, the staggering thefts of Bernie Madoff, and the across-the-board dishonesty shown in the financial meltdown of 2008.<br /><br />But the connection seems fragile. Dan Ariely's research gets nowhere near the mindset and motives of corporate pirates. He focuses instead on the trivial--things like stealing cans of Coke from dorm refrigerators, wearing fake \\"high-fashion\\" sunglasses, and cheating when working with matrices in a contrived experimental study. Not the same at all.<br /><br />Because of that, I had a hard time getting through the book. The first third I read fairly rigorously, the second third I read rather quickly, and the last third I skimmed. I don't think I missed much. As another reviewer said, this book would have been better as an article rather than a book.<br /><br />Much better on a similar topic was the book [[ASIN:1594203385 The Hour Between Dog and Wolf: Risk Taking, Gut Feelings and the Biology of Boom and Bust]]. The author of that book, John Coates, does not have the academic credentials of Dan Ariely. Nor does he have the comedic bent. But where Dan Ariely serves up cotton candy, John Coates serves up meat and potatoes. Although The Hour Between Dog and Wolf has its faults (including a title that makes little sense), it's a much, much better book than this one.<br /><br />One final note about a delicious irony: One of the blurbs on the back of The Honest Truth about Dishonesty reads as follows:<br /><br />In this endlessly fascinating book, Dan Ariely proves that dishonesty is everywhere: we are all bad apples. It's an uncomfortable message, but the implications are huge--and nobody understands this better than Ariely. If you care about the truth, read this book.<br /><br />--Jonah Lehrer, Author of [[ASIN:0547247990 How We Decide]] and [[ASIN:B007QRI1UQ Imagine]]<br /><br />Why is that deliciously ironic? Because Jonah Lehrer is now disgraced and his book Imagine pulled by its publisher, after Lehrer admitted to making up quotes in his book. Yes, indeed, dishonesty is everywhere. But this book--The Honest Truth about Dishonesty--will do little, if anything, to help those who care about the truth. It's full of fluff, and lacking in substance.ves that dishonesty is everywhere: we are all bad apples.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This movie is slow and subtitled. All which I usually can't stand. Mostly because I will either loose interest or because of the subtitles I will have to watch a second time (one to read, another to watch the visuals) or pause and rewind a lot.<br /><br />Yet, this movie with its slow moments and such crafted editing was surprisingly enjoyable! At the end you get a great feel for the life which Jiro and his team have created, why they love what they do & also the passion for the art of sushi making.<br /><br />The thought of dedication and triumph, these men have is inspiring. As a documentary it is well paced and really being the messages across without bias.<br /><br />If you like docs like \\"Good Hair\\" or \\"March of the Penguins\\", I believe you would like this as well. Although different, these docs are oddly entertaining, interesting and very poignant in a way.

I love classic historical fiction/historical romance, and I was hoping to find the same thing in this novel that I had found in Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre (written by Emily Bronte's sister, and way better). I really don't get why so many people rate this as one of their favorites. For me, there needs to be at least one character that I care about. These characters are all unlikeable. That's not to say the book isn't worth reading. it was interesting, and well written, but it could have been so much better.

145162607X|3.0|While I can still only muster three stars for Gregory's latest installment of her series featuring prominent women from England's Wars of the Roses, it was nevertheless better than her previous efforts.  Based on her mediocre other novels (I enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl, but never recaptured enjoyment of her books after that), I wouldn't have even bothered reading this one had it not featured Richard Neville's daughter, Anne, a woman who particularly fascinates me.<br /><br />Anne serves as our narrator throughout the story, but Gregory put herself in a tough position here:  Anne is really far too young to ever be a compelling narrator.  The events she must convey to the reader in order for the story to make any sense are not things a young, noble girl would have known.  Therefore, Gregory is forced to make this information known to Anne (so she can tell you, the reader) through servant's gossip or even her father's confidential conversation -- this latter is so highly improbably (read: impossible) that it makes for laugh-out-loud moments throughout the book.  Really, Neville - the Kingmaker himself - would have confided to his pre-teen daughter his battle plans?<br /><br />Additionally, Gregory puts herself in a fix trying to convey a pre-teen's \\"voice\\" in the narrative...the result is what might be a decent Young Adult story, but not good historical fiction for adults.  Good characters are, of course, very, very good while bad characters have horns and tails.  Delicate characterization doesn't really exist.<br /><br />I'm not one to quibble too much with the historical liberties she takes throughout the novel....yes, it's fiction so she's entitled.  With a little more editing/polishing, the novel has potential.  I particularly liked a childbirth scene and her attempt to cast ol' Richard III in a ambivalent light.  Take away Anne as the narrator and she could have put the reader right in the midst of the action, instead of dwelling on what Anne was wearing that particular day and overhearing the entire timetable of the Wars of the Roses via servant's gossip and she might have had a very good novel.  As it stands, this is historical fiction \\"lite\\".  Nothing worth shelling out $20 on, but might be worth a library checkout if you want something fluffy to read while at the doctor/dentist's office.rticular day and overhearing the entire timetable of the Wars of the Roses via servant's gossip and she might have had a very good novel.

030758836X|1.0|There were parts that I couldn't stop reading and others I wished I didn't.  Overall I really wish I didn't purchase this read in the first place.  The girl was off her rocker.  Then again, it did seem like the character was real.  I didn't like the ending.  Definitely not a feel good book.
0446572993|1.0|I don't usually write reviews, however I have been very disappointed in Mr. Baldacci's latest's novels. The plot is all over the place, I don't care about the characters. This novel is horrible and I have done something I never do - I stopped reading at 70+%. I couldn't stand it any longer. I hope he goes back to what he knows; he doesn't not know Special Ops.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|You know, everything about this book made me wary.  The cheesy cover, the overwhelmingly good reviews (must be shills, I thought), the fact that it's self-published.  I bought it anyway and I read it.<br /><br />How is it possible that a book this good is not more well-known?  This is better than most fantasy out there.  I mean, it is seriously, seriously good.  I can't fathom why I haven't heard of Raven's Shadow before, and why this isn't more popular.<br /><br />Oh well.  I highly recommend it, like all the other reviewers.  Now I have to engage in the long and painful wait for the next part to come out.

B000S81MHY|2.0|The table I received out of the box already had too much play or movement when you turned the Y axis wheel you could see the table snaking in other words moving from side to side as it moved along the Y axis. Which would mean uneven or wavey cuts. So I tried to adjust the table using the tiny little adjustment screws, hopeless system of adjustment, one screw snapped right off so now cant adjust the table properly. Don't know how these tiny screws are meant to stop the table from moving out of square when they are so fragile. To be fair I didn't purchase the table from this seller but it was a brand new Proxxon KT70 table from another supplier. Anyway in my opinion this is FAR from being an awesome product as some have stated.
B006M4F67A|5.0|The touch action is smooth on my Kindle Fire. The tiles look good.  There is a good variety of tile layouts provided.  I have played a few different Mahjong  games. This  is definitely one of the good ones.  If you touch a blocked tile it greys out all of the blocked tiles, making legal plays  more obvious. There is  also a hint feature and reshuffle. Most games have these features. Makes for relaxing play -- which the whole point!
B008133MDK|5.0|I have been around long enough to have watched SH on a TV series in black and white in the '50's.  I try to watch any vehicle that interprets the stories from Sir Doyle.  This version is one of the best.  Particularly like the decision to update using tech devices.  This allows for a faster pace. Sometimes the dialogue is hard to catch so that is why I purchased seasons 1 and 2. It's worth it!!!

B00746O3X8|5.0|I was skeptical at first due to the price. But I must say I'm extremely happy with this camera holster.  I've wanted one of these for years and couldn't get myself to pay the high price of the other brand. I can't imagine that their quality is any better than this model.  I carry two Nikons one with a 400mm lens and one with a normal lens and have no worries.  Also I can't tell you what a pleasure it is NOT to have to carry a camera bag anymore.  I carry the cameras in the bag to the shooting site and then leave the empty bag in the truck and walk around hands free and with no shoulder or back pain.  LOVE this holster.  Would definitely recommend this product.  I would venture to say the bad review for this product was written by a Cotton Carrier TROLL.  This product is WELL worth the money.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|We were amazed that the DVD arrived so quickly - nearly half the approximated delivery time! The DVD is also in good condition. As for the movie itself, it is made up of several interconnected short stories about love. Sometimes that love can be difficult and painful, sometimes it is strange and awkward, other times it is touching and sweet. One of my favorite stories is between a father and his step son, as they build a trusting relationship after the wife and mother - the person who bound them together - has died.<br />All in all, it is a great movie to enjoy with friends and with popcorn. Please be advised, there are moments of nudity and sexual scenes.
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|This is one of those movies where people who like it seem to REALLY like it, and those that don't, REALLY don't. I thought it was decent, but my friends both fell asleep twice. They have no interest in seeing it again, even after I encouraged them to. If you've seen \\"House of the Devil\\", you know how slow paced Ti West's movies can be. \\"The Inkeepers\\" is another film done in that tradition. Fortunately, for \\"The Inkeepers\\", the movie continues to showcase the director's skill for slowly building suspense and confusion. Unfortunately, like \\"House of the devil\\", the suspense just doesn't lead to anything all that original or interesting. A lot of the time, both movies are more style than substance. But, the style is good, so what is the right reaction? If you're thinking this is going to be an all out scare-show of ghosts, think again. If that's what you're looking for, find another movie immediately. There are less than a handful of appearences in the entire movie. In fact, the real scares are few and far between. Although, when they come it is pretty effective. For me, the suspense carried the movie well enough without them. I knew that the slowly rolling plot was leading somewhere, and that things were ever so slowly growing more intense. The problem comes when things finally start to pick up in the last act. It goes somewhere, but it's somewhere pretty boring and rather vague. Ti West's movies are a departure from the popular trends in horror nowadays, which is refreshing, but the payoff seems to all ways be a letdown. I reccomend it, but just know what you're in for...don't watch it when you're tired.<br />  The very best part of the movie, besides the suspense, are the performances. The characters are not all that deep, but the actors convey 20-30-something angst perfectly and give their characters real personality. Sara Paxton is especially great, and in my opinion, carries the entire movie. The performers also all have great chemistry together. The dialogue is modern and fresh and the location is a perfect old New England Inn, just right for a ghost story. The blu-ray has gorgeous picture and the sound design is one of the best i've heard on my home theatre. Definitely turn the lights off, and the sound up for this one.modern and fresh and the location is a perfect old New England Inn, just right for a ghost story.

It really is much smarter than most of the paranormal / gothic adventure tales out there.

It's something I find brilliantly interesting and Harkness does an amazing job.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola's remarkable filmscript and cinematography make this an extraordinary film.  Bill Murray is at his ironic best, an American who is truly lost in contemporary Japanese culture as he visits Japan to film a commercial.  Scarlet Johansson, I always thought, was overrated until I saw her in this film, apparently her break-through film.  Their observations about life and marriage are insightful, and the relationship that these two forge is exquisite in its beauty and its understated qualities.  I saw this film on Showtime in a hotel on a business trip several months ago, liked it so much that I immediately thereafter purchased the DVD, and continue to screen it with friends and family members or even watch it alone.  It is eminently deserving of repeat viewings.

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was panned by secular groups for being too \\"preachy\\", panned by Christian groups for not being spiritual enough. (Although the Hamilton family had to pressure the producers into instilling more of their Christian values than what was wanted) But there will always be people who have to make something bad out of a light-hearted, inspirational film like this--especially considering the source of the inspiration. Bethany sets a great example for young people with her sweetness, positive outlook and faith. She is not perfect: she demonstrates this with some slight snarkiness toward her adversary Molina (although much provoked) Also she sneaks out of the house to go night-surfing knowing her parents probably would not agree to it. This basically amounts to dishonesty and disobedience. But this shows realism rather than idealism; Christian children do sin. There is also a scene in the hospital cafeteria where angry words are exchanged between Bethany's family. This is actually a good lesson to those who feel Christian families are always shown in an unflawed, squeaky-clean light. They are as real as anyone. And although the family's faith is well-emphasized, it is not overdone to the point that it should turn off nonbelievers. There are even a few \\"believe in yourself\\" and \\"trust your instincts\\" pep talks. I frankly loved every minute of it. I don't see how this exceptional young girl's story could NOT have been made a film.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|holy crap - when the UPS fellow came to my door today with my package containing my limited edition version of this series set, i was shocked. the box was gigantic! i opened it up thinking that perhaps amazon used a much bigger packing box as they usually do for my orders... but nope, the walking dead limited edition box was itself huge as well! i've got to say, this is the best limited edition bluray release i have ever purchased. i knew it was going to be pretty good in terms of quality, given that the zombie head is a creation of mcfarlane toys, but i didn't expect it to be THIS good. it's not only life-sized, but it's also very life-like (well, as life-like as a rotting zombie head gets). fantastic job on the packaging of an even more fantastic show. if only my season 1 bluray set had such a container! if anyone out there is wondering whether spending the additional 30 bucks for this edition is worth it, i can state with absolute certainty that it is TOTALLY worth it.

0805095535|4.0|From Paul Auster:<br />\\"Perhaps it is something as simple as this: that a man fears death more at fifty-seven than he does at seventy-four.\\"<br /><br />I've only read Paul Auster's nonfiction but I love it -- whether it's life's coincidences in [[ASIN:0811214982 The Red Notebook]] or this memoir on aging, written over a winter as Auster moves from midlife toward old age. I also feel that the total of an Auster book is less than the sum of its parts. In other words: I love the reading but like the overall works somewhat less.<br /><br />Here he journals about his first 64 years and filters his recollections through his body and the spaces around and within it. It's a chapter-less sequence of musings with just the occasional space on a page to separate vignettes. It's written entirely in second-person point of view -- which immediately raised my guard and then surprised me by becoming less visible and even pulling me into the experience just like it's supposed to. The best passages are the sections of 8-10 pages of solid, unparagraphed text, where he dives deeper and takes the reader along; I grew to love seeing them ahead.<br /><br />Whereas Auster wrote about his father in [[ASIN:0143112228 The Invention of Solitude]], here he writes about his mother, including this passage from a night after they visited her gravely ill second husband in the hospital:<br /><br />\\"...just when you thought it would be impossible for anyone to say another word, when the heaviness in your hearts seemed to have crushed all the words out of you, your mother started telling jokes [...] jokes so funny that you and your wife laughed until you could hardly breathe anymore [...] an unending torrent of classic yenta routines with all the appropriate voices and accents, the old Jewish women sitting around a card table and sighing, each one sighing in turn, each one sighing more loudly than the last, until one of the women finally says, 'I thought we agreed not to talk about the children'.\\"<br /><br />And then this:<br />\\"You have seen several corpses in the past {...} but none of those corpses belonged to your mother, no other dead body was the body in which your own life began, and you can look for no more than a few seconds before you turn your head away.\\"<br /><br />As a whole, it feels like a journal -- a notebook filled with stream-of-consciousness writing from prompts in a memoir class (especially the 53 pages -- one-fourth of the book -- that recall the place of his birth and his 21 residential addresses since). Yet the pages are so good! I'm definitely going to read the rest of his nonfiction.

B004X80QNG|1.0|The latest update removed the ability to sync with Toodledo.<br /><br />I had been using this Pocket Informant for its ability to sync tasks with Toodledo.  This had been working well without issue until the latest update.  The ability to sync with Toodledo (and Google Tasks) has been removed.  A note on the company's web page points the finger at Kindle for not utilizing a native Android calendar.  However, this seems disingenuous given that this functionality existed before the update.  Now I paid $5.00 for an app that is different from what I bought and, as a result, is useless to me.

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Boring, Cheesy, and Disappointing are the three words that sum up this film adaptation of the Hunger Games.<br /><br />I have multiple reasons for WANTING to like the movie, even though I read the book first. I do love the books, and hoped the movie might actually live up to the hype surrounding it.  Unfortunately, it did not.<br /><br />BORING<br />- The movie moves soooo slow. There are so many scenes where nothing is said. In the book, you at least get the internal dialogue with Katness. On screen, it simply doesn't make sense.<br />- These sections lacking dialogue, make the film seem so much longer than it had to be.<br /><br />CHEESY<br />- The acting was simply bad... \\"awe\\" is simply expressed with the same gaping open mouth as \\"shock\\", \\"sadness\\", or \\"surprise\\".<br />- The script, costumes, and special effects were sub par for a movie with this level of hype.  It all seemed very underdone, which ends up making the film seem cheesy.<br /><br />DISAPPOINTING<br />Third, really this is the most important of all... I figured the producers would actually take some time and effort in an attempt to adapt the movie to screen.  They did not.<br />- It's the book, lazily put on screen. For example, exact lines from the book are used in the movie. Normally, this would be ok, except the ones they chose seem been out of place, or... poorly acted, or acted in a cheesy way.<br />- Key storyline moments were missed... it's as if the director, and screen writers read the cliff's notes, and picked the wrong parts to highlight.<br />- Lastly, the casting was wrong.  I really like Jennifer Lawrence, but not for this part. She's too old to play a 16 y/o, and she and all of the characters simply weren't scrawny enough to make you FELL the HUNGER that the characters feel in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />It's a sad, and simply missed opportunity to make a successful book trilogy set up for a lucrative movie trilogy. But, with honesty, I can say that I'm relieved that I can now rule out wasting my time and money on potential sequels... if only I could get those resources back for the first installment.
B007L96VCY|4.0|As far as the original album goes, this is a very good one.  About half of the songs are excellent (Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey, Back Seat of My Car, Too Many People, Smile Away, Three Legs, Monkberry Moon Delight) while most of the rest are at least enjoyable.  The remastering is very good, an improvement on the early 1990s remastering.<br /><br />The extra disk features singles and unreleased tracks.  Oh Woman Oh Why and Little Woman Love are two of my all time favorite McCartney songs.  Of the unreleased material, A Love For You, and ...Seagull Race are the two best, while Rode All Night gets boring quickly and the others let you know why they were left off of the original album.  I would have liked to hear the original versions of Get On the Right Thing and Little Lamb Dragonfly that were recorded in these sessions.<br /><br />All in all, the original album is very good, should be 4 1/2 stars, but the bonus disc is short, with questionable choices, 3 1/2 stars.  Overall, 4 stars, recommended.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have a Leatherman Wave, the multi-tool with two blades.  The blade that I save for delicate use is the regular knife blade.  The blade that gets the tough work is the serrated<br /> blade.  Of course, heavy work means quicker wear on the edge.  The<br />serrations mean that the blade will cut rougher material for longer periods of time between sharpenings, but still it will get dull.  Thus the need for a sharpener.<br />  I have somewhere a diamond tool that's longer than the round aspect of this tool, however since a recent move that thing is gone, hiding somewhere deep in the recesses of a moving box.  I was checking out knives on Amazon and came across this little item.  It has a carbide 'V' groove sharpener as well as a ceramic 'V' groove.  Those are great for putting an edge back on a damaged blade.  I needed the round diamond rod for my<br />serrated Wave blade.<br />  The diamond tool that I lost was probably around $25, and I was reluctant to part with the bucks for a new one.  This little Smith's Pocket Pal is less than ten bucks, and is shipped free if you have a few other items to make up the minimum.<br />  I learned with the tool that I lost that these round diamond rods work great, possibly the only way to sharpen a<br />serrated blade.  It doesn't take a lot of grinding back and forth, like many people do with flat stones for regular blades.  A few short determined strokes and your<br />serrated blade is back where you want it, possibly better than when you bought it.<br />  This thing will fit in any small emergency kit, a kitchen drawer, tool box or even your jeans pocket.  Speaking of your jeans pocket, if you ever sharpen your own pocket knife, put one of these things in that jeans pocket, and keep that knife ready to go to work.

B008QE9VJI|2.0|This film started out ok but lost it's mojo about half way through.<br />It sdeemed  Tim Burton was tired of this film about half way through and gave up on making<br />a good film.  You really should have tried harder, Mr. Burton.  The orginal Dark Shadows<br />movies were something to be proud of.  They still give me the chills.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This series is poorly written with a  very weak story line.

0345803485|1.0|I never thought I'd read something worse than the infamous \\"My Immortal\\" fan fiction, but, alas, I have. And it's called 50 shades of Grey.<br /><br />Although I'd like to say that I don't know how junk like this is popular, I have a sinking feeling it's biggest fans are the Twi-moms who still haven't gotten their complete fix of Edward Cullen. Oh well, it looks like this Christian Grey, a billionaire sadomasochist with a prerequisite dark past, is here to save the day.<br /><br />But where does one start?<br /><br />Shall it be with the overall bad writing that stinks up the page like rotten fish? Or could it be with the poor diction in general? The lack of research done so that an American character is talking like a Brit in some places? Or how about the lack of plot, the lack of characterizations, and the fact that this damned thing is a rip-off of Twilight, but with the names changed? And yes, I know this was Twilight fan fiction, but for God's sake, if she intended on publishing this damned thing, why, oh why, couldn't she make it 100% her own? I might even forgive her for the cruddy writing!<br /><br />All in all, this is a terrible book, a terrible kick-off to what I can imagine will be a terrible trilogy as a whole (I couldn't finish Book One; life is too short to waste on bad books when I could be reading \\"The Alchemist\\" or \\"The Unseen\\" instead). If you want a laugh, read it. Just don't buy it. Borrow it from the library or a friend. But don't give this woman another dime.

B005PK1G76|5.0|I use this on my Quinny stroller because of the fact that it folds up so small as well as having a hinge between the stroller handles.  I simply un-velcro one side and fold up the stroller.  This organizer is durable, roomy and has 2 cup holders as well as a zipper pouch inside for valuables.  My issue with the stroller (no storage or cup holder) was easily resolved with this purchase.  The Velcro straps are secure while holding a wallet, phone, keys and two drinks ~ I never thought twice about it undoing and spilling my items.  Plus, it's machine washable.  You won't be disappointed in this product!!!!!!
0345803493|4.0|LOVED this series. Christian.... sigh what a complex character. glad ana stayed strong and didn't give in to his complete dom-ness :) .

0345803485|2.0|Other reviews of this book give an accurate depiction, but here's my short two cents: The book's characters are in their twenties, but the book's plot and the character's actions are much more akin to 16 or 17 year olds. Several times in the story, I questioned why the author made the characters so old. The plot is quite simple. The sex scenes are quite graphic. Orgasms, blushing, and lip biting happen almost every other page. The author is a little witty and several funny remarks occur throughout the book, but it doesn't save the story. After the first few chapters, you know exactly how the plot unfolds.. The book is not written for anyone past the emotional ups and downs (and associated drama) that came with teenage years.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|I've brought this movie a year ago along with Last Crusade at a Best Buy.  I was curious and wanted to see why so many people hated it. Now having watched and owned all four of Indiana Jones movies I've realized that this movie basically belong to this series. This movie was just a wake up call to let everyone know that the Indiana Jones fanchise, \\"suck\\"! George Lucas and Steve Spielburg are known as the best directors or producers in HollyWood. In reality they're not that great. I will always hate Spielburg for making that god-awful Jaws movie with help kill so many sharks. Than there George Lucas when it comes to movies he is about worst than Spielburg is. Just a one trick-pony director/producer who wouldn't know a good script if it was just sitting on his face & took a dump on him. Star Wars is the only real success that Lucas every had in his whole entire career. A fanchise that is drying up faster than a raisen could. When they both made the first Indiana Jones movie they were already beating a dead horse. The Indiana Jones series in general doesn't really make any sense but seeing it when you/re a child it makes perfect sense. When you are an adult seeing this movie with a good eye you'll notice that some of these Indys films have some holes to them. There are also some holes in the Indys scripts, as well as how the character Indy is truly depicted as. Indiana Jones is surppose to be this archaeologist/professor traveling to different parts of the world looking for lost historical artifacts by himself & probably for himself. A real archaeologists is suppose to dig and research digsites with a team not go all at it by himself. In reality Indiana Jones is nothing more than an average tomb robber just like Lara Croft is.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|The gameplayer can't say they are bored because of redundancy with this innovative app.  Tire of playing one game - then simply go to another without having to change applications on your device.  Using the Kindle Fire I have experienced sticky and jerky controls on some of the games and because of this you can not also reach the score level necessary to gain points.  I've learned to avoid these and move on to games where I can earn points.  Overall a great app for spending your pastime and plenty of challenging games to keep you coming back.
1476712042|2.0|Beautiful Disaster is one of those books that it seems everyone either loves or hates. I am sad to say that I was not one of the ones who loved it. In fact, it's one of the lowest rated books I've ever reviewed here on the blog.<br /><br />Honestly, there is only one thing I liked about Beautiful Disaster and it was the writing. It wasn't spectacularly well written or anything like that but the writing really sped up the book. This is one the few books I've really disliked that I've been able to read in less than a day. Normally if I don't like a book I just stop reading and it takes me forever to get through it. It was the exact opposite with Beautiful Disaster. I could not put the book down. It's kind of like with a train wreck: you know it's going to be bad but you just can't look away. That is basically exactly how I feel about Beautiful Disaster.<br /><br />Let's start with Travis, the super sexy bad boy that everyone seems to love. The first word that comes to mind when I think of Travis is scary. Literally if I met him I would be scared of him. He's mean, he's a bit of a drunk, he's hot-headed and short-tempered, he's brutish, and above all he's just a jerk. There is not a single thing about Travis that I liked. He acted like he owned Abby even when they were supposedly just friends. He beat the crap out of people when they said one wrong word to Abby. He tormented her when she finally found a guy she might want to date. And on top of that he was a clingy, needy guy who couldn't live without Abby. He CRIED at one point when she left him because he was being a stupid jerk. I am perfectly okay with guys crying but this was just taking it to the extreme. He was 100% bad news!<br /><br />As for Abby, she wasn't a whole lot better. In fact, I may have disliked her more than I disliked Travis because she was the one stupid enough to let him get away with all the crap he did to her. She starts off the book saying she'd never fall for a guy like Travis and tries her hardest to stay away from him and make him not want her. Oh and her way of making him not want her is to dress in ratty sweats and a t-shirt with no makeup and flip flops. Umm hello, that's how I dress a lot of the time and I like to think that a guy could still find me attractive dressed like that. That whole thing just didn't make sense to me. You can only be attractive to a guy when you're dressed pretty and covered in makeup? Then there's the whole thing with the bet and her having to live with Travis and sleep in his bed. Okay not so bad, right? Wrong! As soon as she moves in she lets Travis dictate what she does, what she wears, who she hangs out with. She lets him run her life. And as mentioned above when he beats the crap out of people for talking bad about her? She encourages him! What the heck? Why would you encourage your boyfriend to beat someone bloody in the middle of the cafeteria? I'm pretty sure there's a line between defending someone's honor and being a psychopath and Travis crossed that line. Really I could go on and on about the stupid things Abby let Travis do and the stupid things that she did herself but I'm going to stop before this review turns more into a book.<br /><br />As for their whole relationship, I just didn't get it. Travis sleeps with girl after girl and then just decides Abby is the one that he should settle down with? There is no explanation anywhere in the book about what makes her so special. Not once does Travis tell her why exactly he loves her and not all the other billions of girls that he's slept with. At one point Abby has a chance for a healthy relationship with a great guy and she pretty much treats him like shit. She blows him off to hang out with Travis and then at one point she calls him from Travis' phone right after he drops her off from a date to tell him that she's in love with Travis. After spending tons of time denying that to him. Is that really the best way to break it to him? It was a pretty nasty move. Everything about their relationship is just really unhealthy for them both and they know it but they stay together anyway. They are not good for each other and it's clear from the very beginning.<br /><br />Oh and my biggest peeve with this book (which may seem minor to you guys but I couldn't stand it) was the fact that Travis nicknamed Abby \\"Pidgeon\\" or \\"Pidge\\" for short and then gave no explanation why! Seriously, what kind of nickname is that? If my boyfriend ever called me that I would probably laugh in his face and tell him to shut the heck up. It was seriously like Travis didn't even know what her real name was because all he ever called her was Pidgeon or Pidge. It got old really fast and I kind of wanted to just stop paying attention to the story and instead just count how many times he called her that.<br /><br />Overall, I really did not like Beautiful Disaster. I don't recommend it for anyone and I highly suggest you don't waste your money on this one.erything about their relationship is just really unhealthy for them both and they know it but they stay together anyway.

B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Not only one of the best movies of 2011, but one of the best movies I have *ever* seen. Everything about it is of the highest caliber, from the acting to the direction to the cinematography to the music to the air-tight screenplay...this is simply a flawless film. And Amazon has the best price, so stop reading and buy it already!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Love the sound quality - I'm no expert but these sound great, picking up noises in games that I've played for ever but never heard...<br />Range is great on the wireless, can walk from room to room without any loss of signal.<br /><br />Only down side is that the batter seems to last only 6 hours before needing to be plugged in again... the cord that comes with it works great and has a very long reach so there is no real complaint there.
B006GM8NXM|1.0|I haven't read the book series, because I'm not really into vampires, although the premise is cute.<br /><br />Since everyone was raving about the HBO series, I decided to rent it from Netflix.  I lasted about half an hour.  F-bombs every other sentence, and the action and dialogue are crude and raunchy.  BORING.  And the plot?  If you can't grab me within the first 30 minutes, I'm not sticking around to wait for the story to begin.
0345802934|5.0|Say, its only a paper moon<br />Sailing over a cardboard sea<br />But it wouldn't be make-believe<br />If you believed in me<br /><br />Desperate as I always feel after finishing a Murakami novel to write up something profound and properly expressive of what his work seems to always so easily do to me, I never have until now. It always feels futile, foolish-I feel like a three-year-old who has seen a supernova; it's nearly impossible to really articulate what I've encountered, yet perhaps a rich, ambivalent sensory befuddlement is all one can hope for in art. I feel this way more than ever after finishing his most recent and hand-achingly thick masterpiece, but here I am nonetheless.<br /><br />1Q84 feels like quintessential Murakami, full of surreal moments both dazzling and (to this reader, enjoyably) mundane, cats, sadness, loneliness, death, hope, the ethereal and the grubbily all-too-real. Everyone has lost something, and everyone is looking looking looking. I can't ever get over the strange and deliriously paced tone of this and his other books, a tone that in my experience is some mixture of both the translation process and Murakami's indelible presence. It feels comfortable but a bit askew, which of course fits into the Murakami Mode almost too perfectly. If I say that the phrases and paragraphs always seem slightly wary and confused, it isn't a critique of either of those to aspects; rather, I genuinely enjoy the tentative feeling of almost literally every line in the book. There's a sad but quiet intensity, anxiety  hanging over everything, it's beautiful but off-putting (not unlike the double moons hanging in the sky of this somehow-but-not-exact-alternate 1984 Tokyo, one normal and one smaller, dented, green).<br /><br />Many people seem to experience (whether they enjoy it or not) the distinct feeling that Murakami bleeds over into their real world somehow, taints them -- this is absolutely the case for myself, it's always been the hallmark to me of fiction that has a special staying power, has an elusive brilliance. I honestly don't feel like I'll ever look at the moon again with remembering this book; even moments of transit seem to draw it quickly back to my memory, as the characters here are always traveling in one form or another. I was struck even by stunning little coincidences while reading that seemed to signify that I, too, had somehow been pulled a little into a strange alternate reality, had become a shade of green. While sitting down to write this my cat suddenly became incessantly noisy and playful as if trying absurdly hard to keep my attention elsewhere. While reading what was to me the most intense moment of the most intense chapter near the end of the book, `It's Only A Paper Moon' sung by a very young Ella Fitzgerald came onto my Pandora station (I hadn't even `Like'ed the song until then), which very honestly unsettled me for a moment. The `moon' connection aside, the song appears throughout the nove as jazz and classical music one more haunt Murakami's fiction. I had never liked a single jazz song I had ever heard until some of the music in the book sent me searching out of curiosity, and now I cannot get enough. Haunting and infectious perfectly describe this book.<br /><br />I've seen some criticism of the book's close, that it offers either not enough or too much closure. I suppose I'm too easy to please, to connected to what I feel is the Murakami experience I so much seek out and enjoy. I felt at peace with the ending; it's heavily bent and untidy, but that's one thing I love about this book and the rest of his fiction -- it's never tidy, it's never polished or feels like, once you're done, that the book will even fit conveniently back onto the bookshelf. I remember when reading Murakami for the first time, Kafka on the Shore, how struck I was by the duality in these surreal iconic characters and their presences-we first see Johnny Walker, a dashing and menacing presence-but then we get...KFC's Colonel Sanders!? This absurdity, this refusal towards perhaps easier (to write, and to read) gestures and choices. This isn't what he `does', and it's why I'll always come back to his work. It's unsettling, imperfect, confused, awkward, brilliant and it will sometimes tarry, sometimes disappear without waiting for you.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The Avengers is about as good as a summer blockbuster gets these days. It's a tough ask to get a decent storyline out of something with this many characters in it but Joss Whedon makes it look easy with a script that gives each of the main characters a decent amount of screen time. The action sequences are fun and the script is very witty. My personal favourite was the Hulk.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I downloaded this book looking for direction with my own writing career and was pleasantly surprised to find it not only informative but also an entertaining read as well. If you want some food for thought about being an author and a bit of direction for building your own empire all wrapped up with a touch of humor this is definitely the book to get your hands on.

B003QWRA3Y|4.0|This was a good movie with an unexpected twist. Julian Moore was good as always in her role as Catherine. Amanda Seyfried was very sexy in her role as Chloe. Her character seemed to be searching to fill a void in her life. Then she turns a little psycho. You find out how psycho toward the end of the movie. Throw in Liam Neeson and I believe this movie is at least worth renting.
B008645YEE|5.0|This has got to be one of the better scores of all the films.  Some of the music is very grim, however it fits the tone and setting of the film.  I'd like to see a future edition that has an interview with the composer and alternate versions of the songs like many collections have. I'd like to know if there is a version of this soundtrack available with all the music in the film.  From what I've read so far there are other editions available with more DKR music.
B00004U45G|5.0|At first the sound wasn't that great, but I noticed each listen it sounded better & better, I think it's a Russian Import, but not sure. It's like 95% Zep and 5% older blues (BB King, etc) Far superior to Great White's Zep Tribute (see my review) I never get tired of this CD (it's also a double!) Chris does a great job singing, no howling or moaning like Plant, BUT, Jimmy Page is the true star. I love the way he sounds like he's playing two guitars at once, and still has that hard edge. \\"Sick Again\\" from Physical Grafitti is fantastic, actualy, there are no duds AT ALL on this disc. I'm hoping they decide to do another live album. This CD is very addicting, all my friends love it.
B008EL4YX6|1.0|UPDATE:  Very disappointed in the developer, who decided to change this PAID app to a FREE APP and then added advertisements.  Not very fair to customers who paid for it...Why penalize them?  But it doesnt matter to me because now I cant even get passed the opening screen.  When I try to open the app, it says 'loading' but never gets actually opens so I cant play it anymore...So its going into the trash bin<br />I liked this app in theory.  It really makes you think even in the earliest levels.  Im sure there are instructions somewhere but I didnt find themThe tap screen wasnt very responsive...and often would not work or a single tap would lead to the triangle switching  multiple times ruining my move.  It said tap anywhere on the screen but then that wasnt consistent either.  And I wish you could move individual triangles but I understand thats part of the game which can make it harder and make you be able to tap the screen fast to tip one triangle and then be fast to tip it again so that the other one works
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a huge disappointment this book was. So much hype and yet when I finally read it I wondered what all the fuss was about. The story is quite silly and the characters totally unconvincing. The sex scenes come across as though they've been copied from a sex manual. I won't be reading the other books in the trilogy that's for sure.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was curious to see what all the fuss was about so I paid $10 for this on my Kindle. I read it in 3 days because I really wanted to get to the good part... I never did. Although mildly entertaining, the most riveting thing about this book is... the expectation that you are going to read something riveting. The plot was interesting, but it reads like something I would have written in high school. It really does sound like a giggly teenage girl wrote it. It is unbelievable to me that it has made so much money and has gotten many great reviews. Now I'm kicking myself for not trying to publish what I wrote when I was in high school. Apparently there is quite a market for that. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read, but it is highly over-rated and never really delivers. I will not be reading the 2 other books unless they are free. $10 is too much and from what I hear, those never get to the good stuff either.
0345803485|1.0|It is bad. It is so, so, so bad! It is so bad that I've lost some (quite a bit, if I'm being absolutely truthful) of my faith in humanity after finishing this book.  And trust me, finishing this book was a personal triumph.  I'm just so at a loss of how this even came to be a book, then made the New York Times best seller list!  Like countless other reviewers have said, it is poorly written (to the greatest extent of your imagination, it's that awful), I strongly suspect it was not edited at all, the story \\"line\\" is really just a tangled string in disguise, I could not identify with the heroine in the least (her mental and emotional age is 5, and that's insulting to a 5-year-old), etc., etc., etc.  Ultimately, I thought the circumstance of the book really had potential, to delve into the psyche of someone who enjoyed the dominant and submissive lifestyle, but in reality the author did no delving whatsoever, the characters are flat as cutouts and she pointed all the \\"blame\\" on Christian Grey's mommy issues...oh my god. Just-I can't even-
B005LAIISU|2.0|I love all the ice age movies, i mean when the third one came out i just thought that it was the best animateded movie trilogy. when i saw the trailer of the fourth one i was so exited!!! when i wached it, well lets say i didnt laugh at any point of the movie and it was very boring, thw whole pirate thing is so stupid!!!

0385736002|5.0|This is one of my favorite books that I have read so far. I like the idea about alchemy behind the plot. The thought of a magic that has almost everything to do with science fascinates me. The plot was very well written and original. There are many battles to keep you interested. There is also much mythology inside of the story. I cannot wait to read the others in the series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kole for Book Sake.

B005LAIGSM|3.0|I'm torn here.  The movie itself is a boatload of clich&eacute;s and corny moments that add up to one gigantic `gush' of romantic goo, but there is something genuine and likable about the film regardless of its apparent obviousness.  From the very first frame, McAdams and Tatum go WAY out of their way to create this depiction of puppy love at its most puppy like.  They make goo-goo eyes at one another and cuddle and act all cute and love-like and it made me want to roll my eyes because, well, it's just not realistic.  You let it go for a scene or two and then Tatum starts writing messages with food and you realize that this film is just NOT going to give it a rest.<br /><br />And then, it kind of does.<br /><br />The film is `inspired' by a true story, and I'd love to know how much of it is true since it really does turn into `The Notebook' after a while and I'm wondering how many liberties were taken in order to recreate McAdams most famed role.<br /><br />Leo and Paige are deep in love, married and carefree, when they are in a car accident and Paige suffers from brain trauma and wakes up not remembering her life past Law School.  Sadly, she didn't meet Leo until long after Law School, and so she's back in college (in her head), in love with another man and deeply attached to her parents, whom she actually hasn't spoken to in five years but cannot remember why she ever stopped.  Her parents swoop in and try to convince her to leave her husband and come live with them.  Leo is adamant that she resume her life with him, but her life is such a contrast to everything that she remembers that it makes things extremely difficult for the both of them, and her parent's looming influence is weighing heavily on Paige's eventual decisions.<br /><br />So, like I said, this opens with a rushing gush of laughably corny romantic notions, but once Paige leaves the hospital there is a break from the overly pushy lovey-dovey stuff and we get into the heart of this story; the real love.  We see Leo fighting to remind his wife of why she loved him in the first place and we see him struggle to break free of the opinions of many around him who seem to feel that Paige will never remember him.  Tatum is a force here, and really understands the depths of `love' his character is feeling, not to mention the frustrations and despair he feels.  The visual ideas that cover some of the scenes are a bit much (director Sucsy's decisions can make the film overly sappy in many moments) but Tatum sells everything with a realism that betrays the film's overall flow.  McAdams is less effective, and she stumbles in places, but she turns in a nice performance.<br /><br />I have issue with some of the plot points.  Paige's parents and their depiction is rather evil and I just can't fathom a family actually treating their daughter's marriage and the son-in-law they don't even know with such contempt.  They are childish and selfish and heartless and when you eventually find out why Paige stopped talking to them it winds up being a far less offence than the one they are currently guilty of.  Couple that with the overt corniness of the film's core romantic moments and you have a film that leaves me seriously divided.<br /><br />I'm like right down the middle, because this film does have merit even if it doesn't really deserve it.see Leo fighting to remind his wife of why she loved him in the first place and we see him struggle to break free of the opinions of many around him who seem to feel that Paige will never remember him.

B00005R5G9|1.0|This movie sucks. I mean it relly sucks. I'm not even kidding, it sucks. I don't think it could suck anymore.
0307341577|4.0|What an awesome novel!  Some people have complained that the protagonist is \\"unlikeable,\\" but I think her very damaged, flawed human-ness is perfect.  She is a total mess of a human being but her personal journey in trying to make sense of what happened that deadly night is part of her process of becoming a functional adult, and you end up rooting strongly for her.  You won't find a pretty, popular Nancy Drew type character in this story.  What you will find are absolute train-wrecks of people, some of them with good intentions and terrible luck, others who are selfish users, and one or two who are genuinely rotten.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I had a brief \\"oh-come-on\\" moment at the ending when everything was explained, but overall it was a great read.  Now I need to go and catch up on all the tasks I've left undone while I spent the last few days unable to put this book down!
1936891026|1.0|I got the CD version of this to listen to in the car - what a waste! If I'd gotten this at a big box store I would return it. I cannot imagine how this drivel got so many 5 stars. Resistance is everything, literally, everything from dirty floors to clinical depression. And yet there is not one substantive suggestion on \\"overcoming\\" resistance beyond sit down and do your work. (Srsly?) There is no Art in this book at any level, the writing itself is poor and even the cover lacks creativity.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I'm not going to give you little details and techno-jibber-jabber.... you want to know one thing - do I really need to upgrade? The answer is yes! I honestly don't think I have seen this well done of a restoration - so sharp, looks natural - to paraphrase Spielberg in one of the extras on the restoration process - it looks better than it did in the theaters!<br /><br />Seriously, I've seen a few \\"restoration\\" versions that are just upscaled, or some that suffer from too much added light sources... this one sets the benchmark! I hope as much attention will be spent on the upcoming Universal 100th Anniversary Bluray editions...
B000S88JTS|5.0|I remember watching this video at the local motorcycle shop open house at least twenty five years ago. As a kid, we used to love going to these just for the free hot dogs and donuts, but watching this video hooked me on the fun you could have with motorcycles. I have since owned a few motorcycles and ride as much and as often as I can. When I heard this video was being re released, I purchased it for my dad who got me started with bikes.<br /><br />The video is great, quite an interesting look back at how \\"real racers\\" had to do it all themselves. Yes, there is a skill to what the modern day riders do, but not sure how many of them would have faired compared to the guys that did it way back.<br /><br />You have to watch it, I would recommend it to everyone and anyone!
B005S1Y44Y|5.0|I have seen some mixed reviews of the Queen SHM SACDs. I have found that the two I own (News of the World and Night at the Opera) to be great releases. They are newly remastered in 2011 and provide a nice and tight bass with crisp highs. The price tag is a bit high but that is the case with all of the SHM SACDS. IMO this is a fantastic opportunity to own a great -if not the best- digital version of Night at the Opera.<br /><br />For those of you newer to SHM SACDS they are 2 channel SACD layer only. Hopefully, one day, they will start to release multi channel SACDS.
034580404X|3.0|I live a lifestyle like this behind closed doors, and its great when my husband tells me he's going to spank me or do bad things when we get home when we are out in public...VERY much a turn on!  My curious mind led me to read these books and while they were ok, they were not what I expected.  The first book was great and entertaining, and I picked up the second thinking there would be added debauchery and kinkery on the next level.  Instead, it was a story about a man learning to love himself and others and putting his past behind him and moving forward. Good love story, but I thought it was supposed to be erotic fiction; books 2 and 3 missed that mark.
B006WQJI0Y|2.0|This review is for the shm sacd. I can't figure this release out. I mean it is all over the place. A song starts out soft and then gets louder towards the end. It's almost unlistenable. I'm guessing it was the original recording based on the insert that mentions DSD being transferred from the analog master tapes. The whole thing isn't a total waste but damn near close. Not worth the current price tag. Paranoid and the first release are far better sounding and very recommend.

Ever since I got my first Mac Classic II on which I wrote so many dissertations in high school.<br />I've always known that Jobs was unique, both in his positive side and in his darker one.

B0025KVLRY|5.0|Come on!!  It's the Beatles.  They're awesome.  Legends.  You can't go wrong!  If you love music.... you gotta love the Beatles.  This is probably considered one of their best albums... though personally... I think it is the best.
B008JEJVXG|4.0|Jack Tatum's Wild Nothing made a pretty impressive showing with its last album, GEMINI.  The debut album was a beautiful collection of lo-fi, reverb-drenched dream pop.  Comparisons were drawn to The Smiths, The Cure, Joy Division, New Order, and a variety of other 80's new-wave bands.  The comparisons are apt: Tatum's music lends a lot of tonal cache to the nostalgic bands of decades past.  Wild Nothing's music isn't unoriginal though; while it may be inspired by the work of others, Wild Nothing is a band that could have only existed now.  The band's second album, NOCTURNE, feels like GEMINI with a bigger budget.  It's not quite as lo-fi, but the same shoe-gazing soundscapes are here.<br /><br />Lead track \\"Shadow,\\" (and also one of the album's singles) is an immediate mission-statement.  Most of what you need to know about the album can be found in its first track: reverb-drenched vocals, an airy and loose quality to the instrumentation, romantic lyrics -- it's all represented here. \\"Paradise\\" takes listeners on a strange sonic journey that leads through multiple arrangements, sustained by Tatum's more baritone vocals.  \\"This Chain Won't Break\\" and \\"Disappear Always\\" are a little more grounded than Tatum's normal dream-pop work, and the detour proves to be a successful one.  While Wild Nothing is good at being romantic and dreamy, some of the most successful songs feature the band playing to their most \\"normal.\\"<br /><br />Fans of Beach House, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, or The Horrors (more recent output) would be advised to check out Wild Nothing's work.  While I still prefer their debut, GEMINI, NOCTURNE is a solid listening experience.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008XDSWBU This Chain Won't Break]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008XDSWOC Disappear Always]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008XDSUXU Shadow]].\\"  This album proves that GEMINI wasn't a fluke and that songwriter Jack Tatum is a musical identity to keep an eye on.
0807014273|5.0|One of the most significant books I have ever read.  Not only was it interesting from the viewpoint of his story of life in a concentration cam, but also in the way he shared his views on the lessons taught by his experience.  These lessons are able to be applied immediately in one's life with success.  I only wish that I had read it as a young man intead of at this advanced age.  The lessons to be learned are immdiately applicable  to one and all.  Reading this short book carefully is a life changer.
B008C401YG|4.0|When I heard that Sean Rowe his passion and connection to nature, it didn't really come as a surprise.  While many of his songs don't handle the subject directly, there's something about Rowe's organic, heavily acoustic, warts-and-all approach that feels wild.  His music sounds alive -- like it hasn't been preprocessed or touched by studio hands.  His debut, 27 was released in 2004, the followup (MAGIC) in 2009, and now, in 2012, the next installment, THE SALESMAN AND THE SHARK, is here.  Rowe's brand of songwriting feels natural; it's unpretentious but smart; it's not overwrought but heartwrenching.  With his songwriting built around Rowe's tendency for instinctual decisions, THE SALESMAN AND THE SHARK never feels too thought-out or contrived.<br /><br />Rowe's voice falls somewhere between the deep croon of Leonard Cohen and the lived-in baritone of Tom Waits.  He has a deep voice (compared to most of today's music), and it often booms throughout his record.  When the female vocalist appears in \\"The Wall,\\" it's a pleasant surprise.  It's a quiet duet, and while the two vocalists don't have the same chemistry as say a Isobell Campbell & Mark Lanegan, it's quite beautiful.  There are a few times when vocal accompaniements come up on this album, (\\"Signs\\" and \\"Old Shoes\\"), but Rowe completely overpowers others here.<br /><br />This album is honest and introspective, and while some of it does reflect back on modern living, most of the lyrics seem to come from Rowe grappling with mortality, health, and his own weaknesses.  Particularly revealing is the refrain \\"I'm getting older, I'm getting older,\\" in \\"Signs.\\"  After the 1-2-3 punch of ballads previous to it, the uptempo \\"Horses\\" is a welcome change of pace.  Laced with tribal percussion, off-the-rails acoustics, and radically changing dynamics, the song serves as one of the album's highlights.  \\"Thunderbird\\" sounds like it would have belonged on one of Tom Waits (pre-RAIN DOGS era) older albums -- it's mostly stripped back and minimal.  For the last track on the album, Rowe strips back even more instrumentation until there's only (mostly) a piano left.  \\"Long Way Home\\" contains some of the best lyrics here, bordering often on poetry, and it's an especially poignant ending to an album that is full of emotion.<br /><br />Sean Rowe's third album is packed -- there's so much here to search through and discover.  THE SALESMAN AND THE SHARK is an album with a big heart, and Rowe's lyricism gets better and better with each record he releases.  I would recommend this album to anyone who likes the baritone-crooning singer-songerwriter style, like Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, or Mark Lanegan.  This album surely puts Rowe's name among these greats.  Standout tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B008HHJG12 Horses]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008WOUKW4 Joe's Cult]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B008WOUKPQ The Lonely Maze]].\\"  Across this album, I seemed to prefer the more uptempo tracks than others, but this probably varies by the listener.

B007I2BZIE|3.0|I am a great fan of Rush. I like pretty much anything they produce. But I have had to live with disappointment with the more recent albums - because of the sound not the songs and music. Presto was borderline and transition when it came to sound mixing. Everything after that (e.g., Vapor Trails, Snakes and Arrows) has been downright terrible. You cannot listen to more than 10 minutes of this kind of sound. Heavy, harsh, continuous, and almost offensive to say the least. Whatever happened to those great days of raw natural sound mixing (2112, Moving Pictures, Hemispheres,... ). Damn the computer age for this. Not all \\"progress\\" is for the better, evidently. Dylan recently lamented about how horrible much of the new recordings sound. Too bad, because the songs that Rush is writing are still awesome . . .
B0069UP2PI|4.0|This movie has plenty of suspense and the story is great, with Laurence Fishburne and Gwyneth Paltow plays a marvellous role with susporting cast making it better still. All about a virus with a bit of this and that thrown in for good measure and people trying to control it, thats it, no more not going to spoil a great movie by telling you everything. Thoughly entertaining enjoyable from the beginning to the end. Get the drinks and munchies ready and try to rest on your armchair while watching this controling deadly show.
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|I ordered this product from Amazon on Sunday, and it arrived today.  The box is the SAME size as last year, the set contains 32 LESS pieces as last year, yet it costs $10 MORE than last year.  A very poor combination without a doubt (especially given that last year's Star Wars Advent Calendar didn't sell very well and was available on clearance just about everywhere after the holidays).  But, in spite of that I couldn't risk not having a copy of what is otherwise a very cool Lego set in my collection.  I had a blast opening mine last year, and am looking very forward to opening this one this year.<br /><br />Next I'm going to list the set contents, so please skip the next two paragraphs if you want to be surprised.  But, since most of this info is available in the Amazon photos or easily obtainable online, I thought I'd also provide it hear for those who are interested.  Note, I purposefully list everything in alphabetical (and not chronological) order so as not to spoil the surprise too much. Not to mention the fact that I'm waiting to open mine and don't even know the order of appearance myself at this point.<br /><br />Depending on how/what you count, the set includes nine mini figures.  The obvious appeal of this new set are the two exclusive Santa Darth Maul and Snowman R2-D2 figures.  On top of that you also get Gungan Warrior, Hoth Rebel Trooper, Imperial Officer (Hoth), Rebel Trooper, Snowtrooper, Security Battle Droid, and Super Battle Droid.<br /><br />Other surprises include: AT-AT Walker, Darth Maul's Sith Infiltrator, General Grievous' Starfighter, Gonk Power Droid (may also count as a mini figure to some), Gungan Shield Set, Gungan Submarine, Guns and Lightsaber, MTT, Naboo Flash Speeder, Naboo Royal Cruiser, Naboo Starfighter, P-Tower Turret, Separatist Shuttle/The Lapiz Cutter, Super Star Destoyer, and Vulture Droid.<br /><br />So, there seems to be a bit more of a focus on the prequel this year, but still a sufficient amount of original trilogy stuff to keep just about everyone happy. And, while a few of the models leave a little to be desired, I also impressed at how well Lego is able to make a good representation of many of these items with so few pieces.<br /><br />I agree that $49.99 is a very expensive price tag for this set (it make so little sense it almost seems like it could be a mistake). And, I hope for everyone's sake that it comes down before they run out (preferably before the holidays, but even after would be fine if everyone who wants one is able to get one).  But, like I said earlier, I had so much fun opening mine last year I decided to splurge and buy at least one copy of this year's Lego Star Wars Advent Calendar to be safe.f to keep just about everyone happy.

B001HBX8NC|3.0|The photography and scenery are vivid and attractive. The orchestra is fine, the singers are talented and on pitch. But no one is having any fun. That is the unfortunate look and feel of this production. Elena Mosuc, especially, looks put out having to suffer through curtain call.

B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie kicks but in such an amazing way. It tells A few different stories that all coincide with each other & each have A good mix of action & drama.

B002NANLCE|4.0|4.5 out of 5 stars. Robert Sawyer sure knows how to explore that whole free will verses determinism thing in the most entertaining way.  First, let's get on with the comparison between the novel and the television series. I loved both, but they are completely different stories outside of the starting premise that an experiment involving a Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is instrumental in accidentally causing all humanity to black out for a couple of minutes to experience a vision of the future. Of course, the act of the entire human race suddenly losing consciousness makes for a bit of a mess as planes crash upon take off and landing, cars collide into each other, people tumble down flights of stairs, milk is over-frothed. And this is where the novel and the TV series diverge.<br /><br />In the TV series, the flash forward is set 6 months in the future, whereas the novel it is set 21 ½ years in the future. This sets the tone for an entirely different set of problems, especially for those who didn't have a vision. Additionally, the main characters are different (outside of Lloyd Simcoe) and the story itself goes into a completely different direction between novel and the TV series.<br /><br />Sawyer did an outstanding job of exploring the various theoretical physics models of the universe and its implications for the human condition in a way that was digestible for those of use without degrees in the hard sciences.  The main character Lloyd was attempting to find the Higgs Boson particular with the LHC at CERN; however, he inadvertently caused the flash forward which caused the deaths of millions (car crashes, planes falling from the sky, etc). Naturally, Lloyd feels immense guilt. Meanwhile his partner, the young Theo had no vision at all, which he soon realizes means that he is dead in 21 ½ years. Theo wants to find how he died in order that he may prevent it. Theo and countless others hope that the future is not set, that time is not immutable. But Lloyd sees it differently. Given his own guilt, he hopes that time is immutable; he posits that we live in a block universe whereby time is analogous to layers of film stacked upon itself. Everything that happened has happened and that which is going to happen has already happened, just as the ending of a film has been finished whether or not you you've seen the ending. Casablanca will always end the same way, will always be the way it has always been no matter where you are in the film. I forget the particulars of the theory, but Lloyd calls this a \\"block universe.\\" The important thing is that a block universe is completely deterministic, completely immutable. We cannot change anything.<br /><br />Sawyer showcases some of the most intriguing concepts coming out of physics, most of which are in conflict, through the discourse and the drives of the characters. The story itself is engaging, rarely did I find myself skimming through, and Sawyer assumes the reader is capable of asking oneself some hard questions about what it is free will. I've always counted on Sawyer's ability to do this, as he is a remarkable and accomplished story teller with talent for creating original and cerebral concepts to explore the human condition in an entertaining way. That being said, Sawyer, this is a message for you. Please use that Thesaurus option in MS Word. You have penchant for the word \\"doubtless,\\" don't you? At first I thought it was just a strange Canadian thing like watching hockey or being polite. But my Canadian friends never say \\"doubtless.\\" And levitating cars in 2030? Really, Sawyer? Really? We're going to drive cars that levitate? Are they also going to fold up and fit into our wallets? I think you're spot on so many points that that little part about levitating cars (not flying, I grant you) threw me off. Other than those two little objections, I am a total fan of the novel. Sawyer has me thinking late at night about free will and whenever an author does that, I know it's a winner. Good going!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|LOVED this movie!!  A must see.  Don't understand why it was not released in theaters in US. Warning- have the kleenex handy!
B0084IHVC0|4.0|Walt Disney was involved with the planning of this movie (back when it was originally to be a live-version TV movie); once he passed away, much of the plot and motivations were changed. According to some of the featurettes on the disc, economy was a major factor in keeping the animation simple, removing characters, plot twists, and a few songs. Although the economy can be very apparent (especially in the style of animation), it is still a very sweet movie. Imagine a melding of \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" and \\"101 Dalmatians\\" for cats, and you would probably be able to figure out the storyline here. There are no nail-biting sequences nor extraordinarily evil villains, yet the resulting animated film is definitely endearing and full of memorable songs. Maurice Chevalier was coaxed out of retirement by the Sherman Brothers (details are in one of the extra segments) to sing the title song and none other than Louis Armstrong sings the wonderful fast-paced song, \\"Everybody Wants to Be A Cat.\\" Phil Harris lends his voice to the lead male role of O'Malley the Alley cat (and duets with Louis on the previously mentioned song). Eva Gabor plays the female lead, Duchess, the mother of three kittens and apple of her wealthy mistress' eye, Adelaide (the voice of Hermoine Baddeley). I can't say enough positive things about Gabor; she has a subtlety of emotion, charm, and humanity that shines through her wonderful accent. Despite her character being spoiled by her mistress and obviously living a very pampered life, through Gabor's voice, you can also hear that Duchess is very wise to O'Malley's flirtatious ways.<br /><br />Briefly, the story is of Duchess and her three kittens who live in pampered Parisian luxury with the elderly Adelaide until the greedy butler, Edgar, decides to kidnap the cats so that he can inherit all of Adelaide's wealth instead of the cats. Dumped far away in the country, it takes O'Malley the Alley Cat to help get them back to Adelaide's, but not without a few fun journeys along the way. Sterling Holloway is wonderful as the cat's unlikely pal and hero, Roquefort. The animation has a similar rough-sketch look to it that \\"101 Dalmations\\" did. The picture quality is crystal clear on Blu ray, as is the sound. Don't expect a whole lot of dynamic range from the soundtrack, other than during some of the chase sequences or the jazz song \\"Everybody Wants To Be A Cat.\\"<br /><br />The extras appear to be pretty much the same from the previous DVD release, although the Blu-ray Disc (mercifully) doesn't have any of the games on it. \\"Bath Day\\" (6:38) is a cute Minnie Mouse cartoon with Figaro the cat. I really enjoyed the excerpt from a 1956 Wonderful World of Disney show (hosted by Walt himself) entitled \\"The Great Cat Family\\" (12:50) with a fun history of the cat, accompanied by some wonderful animation. Richard Sherman introduces a deleted song (\\"She Never Felt Alone\\"), accompanied by storyboard sketches and production drawings, using the original demo audio recordings. Sherman also talks about \\"The Lost Open\\" of the movie, which is an expanded version of what we currently see. One of the characters was written out due to economy and the action was definitely tightened up. Although I can't say the character is really missed, it is obvious that with all of the deletions from Walt's original intent, some of the richness of the original narrative is lost. Adelaide's strong bond to her cats is not quite as established because of the loss of the song \\"She Never Felt Alone.\\" \\"The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs\\" (4:33) has both of the Sherman brothers (but mainly Richard) talking about how they created the memorable musical numbers for this animated feature. There is also an odd little \\"Oui Oui Marie\\" remix music video by Ditto thrown in, as well as the ability to sing-along with four different tunes from the film.<br /><br />What's missing? Sure would have been nice to have an overall \\"Making Of\\" featurette, but still thisis a solid release and an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />If you already have the previous DVD release, then I can't necessarily say that you have to rush right out and purchase the Blu-ray upgrade. However, if you don't have a home video copy of this movie (or it's a VHS copy), then definitely purrrrrrrchase this version!<br /><br />SPECS: Blu-ray Video: 1080p High Def/1.78:1 Blu-ray Audio: English, 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio; French and Spanish, 5.1 Dolby Digitalis a solid release and an enjoyable movie.<br /><br />If you already have the previous DVD release, then I can't necessarily say that you have to rush right out and purchase the Blu-ray upgrade.

031620157X|5.0|I must say, I wasn't expecting very much when I started reading the book, because I've had terrible experiences with actors/singers who attempt to write... but I was pleasantly surprised by the effort and imagination Chris Colfer has put into his very first novel. The story is very enjoyable, very well plotted and with characters that just hold on to your heart even after you are done reading. I loved the twins, Alex and Connor, I loved the new interpretation of the fairy tale characters (especially I loved the Red Riding Hood!) and I loved the message the author has put in the story. It's just magical! A must read for everybody who loves a good book and especially for the lovers of fantasy. Way to go Chris! Can't wait for the sequels!

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Overall fun and addictive game. I'm a fan of the missions that they have you do, although I wish it were easier to get more coins in the game. Despite that, it's still great and you won't be disappointed.

B005LAII12|2.0|OK, I'm a pretty big Seth McFarlane fan.  I love Family Guy and his Cavalcade of Comedy.  This movie however, missed the mark.  I had high expectations of it and it totally let me down.  It had its funny moments and I laughed here and there, but the plot was BEYOND boring.  I couldn't have cared less about the relationship between Mark Wahlberg & Mila Kunis.  Any opportunity to shoehorn in an f-bomb was not missed.  I swear more than the average joe, but even I thought it was unnecessary and excessive.  So if you're a fan of Seth McFarlane and haven't seen this yet, go pay a buck & get it out of a machine in front of the drug store.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had a difficult time getting into the book but stayed with it and actually began to enjoy the twists and turns the storyline took all the while thinking this is really much better than I first thought. I thought this all the way up to the LAST page upon which I was sorry I wasted my time with it. It was disappointing and less than creative to say the least.  Im giving 3 stars due to the fact that I found it interesting until the very last page.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I bought this book based on all the 5 star reviews, I mean, its rated at nearly 5 stars! Award winning authors are rarely rated so high! And I love post-apocalyptic stories, so I was excited to read it, and had high expectations. All I can say, is what a disappointment. I should have read a sample. It left me wondering where all the 5 star reviews came from . . .  The idea was interesting. I thought the concept of the Silo was pretty unique although not terribly unique. I've read other &#34;closed system&#34; post-apocalyptic stories. A big issue for me was the supposed science in this science fiction novel (rather the lack thereof). It was weak to the point of being non-existent. I like a hard science fiction base to my science fiction, at least in the pertinent, plot dependent parts. I felt Wool had none.  From the very beginning I was skeptical of the Silo itself, the sustainability of the population, the supply of food (as example, fruit juice from fruit trees grown under grow lights) or even such things as clothing (where does the material for making/mending such things come from?), grow lights/computers that last centuries. Where are the replacement parts coming from? Hard drives aren't viable for that long.  Next, the characters were uninspired and uninspiring, and they kept saying and doing things contrary to their character, going through very involved mental gyrations to support it. Any explanation would have been better than paragraphs of internal dialogue that was supposed to make me think &#34;well, okay, then, in that case, NOW it makes sense.&#34; when really it just leads me on a downward trend where characters and plot made less and less sense. My suspension of disbelief was completely eroded. I never really got to know any of the main characters before they were gone and cared very little what happened to them. I would end up skimming much of the rambling internal dialogue or strange, stilted speeches. The dialogue was very frustrating to me. It ran on too long and too preachy to be believable. Everyone sounded the same or had cliché, caricature accents. Much of the character background, history and setting information was given in this format, pages and pages of excruciatingly detailed dialogue on subjects/history that the characters would already know and was just recited for the reader's benefit. Most often, after the first hundred pages or so, I understood most of it anyway, and subsequent lengthy pauses of the actual story to read through yet another scene/dialogue of two characters (who already know this stuff) stand around and recite pages of info-dumping dialogue.  Finally, I come to the most frustrating part of the book for me. I can forgive a lot given an interesting plot and characters, which in Wool, in my opinion, both were not strong, although they not terrible either. But, the writing style itself, really jarred me. I was pulled from the story again and again and again by awkward descriptions in overwhelming detail on how a drawer is closed or a tool used or a knife returned to its sheath. It was to the extent that these simple actions, that often did not even need to be addressed at all, were rendered in such detail as to go on for sentence after sentence, for a paragraph at times. I do not need to know what the drawer looked like, how heavy it was, how paper protruded from it like tongues or mummified skin or ancient dried leaves from a better time, just how the squeal of it closing sounded like some over worked, tired machine, echoing out of the bowels of the decimated past (this is not a real example from the story but created for illustration purposes based on many such similar renderings). I was annoyed to the point of eye rolling, to read how someone opened the door, came through the door, closed the door, walked across the floor, stood or sat or leaned, looked, spoke, whatever. I felt like there was way too much description and detail that I'm sure was intended to add to the story butreally ended up taking too much away from it. I started skimming much of this, looking for the plot and characters within, and found less and less as the story progressed.  My suggestion would be to read a sample or purchase the lower priced first installment if it is still available before purchasing the rest.
B005USZYDU|4.0|Great read! Good plot leading into the next book. Always exciting throughout. A new adventure at each corner. GRAB THIS BOOK.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book, it was a little repetitous not as bad as the first 2 books but it was an awesome read, love the fact that Ana could help Christian recover from all his fears.<br /><br />Love that Christian and Ana got married I did see it coming but it was an unexpected twist because i was expecting a whole chapter devoted to the wedding and them honeymoon but was good that you at least get to read about what took place from Ana's memory.<br /><br />Book ended good, still think there could be more but the author ended it with a nice \\"thats all for now\\" so fingers X there'll be more, its one of those books that you'll definitely think about reading again, it just leaves you thinking when will I ever find my Christian?<br /><br />All in all it was a great summer read
B008D28HYS|3.0|I really enjoy the gameplay itself--it's a new challenging twist on a classic puzzle game. While I am glad I have the option of not turning on the spyware included, I would much rather it wasn't part of the game at all. Also, the game started flickering after a few levels and won't stop. This is very distracting and makes it difficult to touch the correct boxes sometimes. I am using an HTC Rezound.

B002VX3RCW|4.0|After reading such great reviews, I ordered this toy for my 6 month old son.  He initially played with it quite a bit, although mostly chewing on the rings.  After a week, he still plays with it, but not any more than his other toys.  I have to admit, I was hoping he would play with this a lot more.  It's still a nice toy though, very bright colors, and the perfect size for little hands.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|Try stating the region, i was sent a USA disc instead of EUROPE, not stated ANYWHERE on the description. Great film, bad and floppy packaging on the disc itself.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|So, I pre-ordered this, with the rest of my TV, months ago. No clue that this was going to be as big a set as this was. The series and season are good, they're excellent, but I'll let others describe those. Me? I'm going to focus on the actual product here instead.<br /><br />This box comes with 3 Blu-Ray discs, packaged by themselves. At the price paid for it, you'd think that would be all you get, considering it's a pretty standard price. HBO goes the extra mile though, by far. This set ALSO comes with (separately packaged) 2 double sided DVD's with all 12 episodes.. But wait, THERE'S MORE!!! HBO also throws in one code that allows you to download ALL episodes, PLUS 3 special features, ALL in HD off of iTunes.<br /><br />I've got, in my collection, probably 30, 40 television shows, most with multiple seasons. NONE of them have given out this much for this little. I think the closest I've seen was Chuck and Grimm with Ultraviolet digital copies (which aren't horrible, but they're not iTunes), nothing at all with the amount of 'extra' release content we have here.<br /><br />EXCELLENT job, HBO. Keep up the great work!!!
B000J159N8|5.0|Great movie. One of my all time favorites.
B005LAIGRS|4.0|The movie features good super spy turned bad Tobin Frost (Washington) who is hunted by the inexperienced safe house attendant Matt Weston (Reynolds). The plot follows these two along their path and the twists and turns are about as expected. Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood and he saves this film from mediocrity. Reynolds, is well, Ryan Reynolds, not a great actor, but not terrible; he is believable as a dude who can kick ass but is not nearly as lethal as Tobin Frost. This is one that I'm glad I rented; it's worth watching once, but I don't think I'd want to keep it in my library. For the most part, you get what you'd expect; a lot of action, blood, fights, gun fire, chases, and some drama.<br /><br />-Raeden Zen
B007SGM084|5.0|I love love love this book. I read all three books--Friday through Monday. I neglected everything to read this book--food, housework, shopping, eating real food.  I also lost some weight. Good thing I don't have to punch a clock. I got the kindle version so I was able to take it with me when I needed to use the bathroom. This book stirred some desires, and longings within me. I feel the need to enjoy the best things in life. The romance and eroticism is not lost me, however, this book revived my dormant desires and motivations to live my best life yet. And, the sex, that girl had more orgasms in one month that I had in my lifetime. I am 49 years old and this book thrilled me the same way I was thrilled in my early teen years, and then some, when I read \\"mills and boons\\" and \\"harlequin\\" romance novels.  Maybe I am biased because I love romance novels, but these were great books. As soon as I was done, I bought the next book. E. L  James stole a line from Twilight, \\" I can't stay away from you\\". I was this crazy about the Twilight Saga also. I bookmarked several pages so I could  re-read when I was finished with this trilogy. I could re- read these books from beginning  and still feel the sensations run through my body. Believe me when I tell you that people do have sex all over place.  This might be a fantasy for some people and normal for others.  I am from the group of others that is why I love, love, love this book. My vocabulary has also grown after reading these bookS. My favorite new word is mercurial.<br /><br />I read a sample of all three books from my public library e-books catalog. I am with two libraries and each waiting list for the trilogy is 250 or more people long.  I bought all three books because I refused to wait. As soon as I was finished reading one, I immediately purchased the next in line.  WARNING: THESE BOOKS COULD MAKE YOU FEEL VERY VERY SEXY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS.  E.L. James hit every erotic nerve in my body with these books.  I am still reeling from the sensations. By the way, there are some unexpected events in the books that include slapping, shooting, kidnapping, bitch-stopping, sabotage, breaking and entering, etc  that are not sexual that adds to the excitement. So yeah, I give it 15 stars.  I want more. I want the Christian Grey version.<br /><br />I don't usually do book reviews, but like I said, the books have me under a spell of some sort, I had to write a positive review.  I am off to re-read parts of the book AGAIN.

0385737955|2.0|I tried this book based on reviews and thought it had an interesting premise. However, the characters were all flat, the drama was meaningless, and the ending was unsatisfactory. I did continue with the other two books, hoping the series would get better. It didn't. The author seemed to not know what to do other than to keep throwing terrible situations at various characters without any real reason. The final book doesn't explain things in any understandable manner. And none of the characters develop at all. I don't recommend this book nor this series.

B00406UK7S|4.0|\\"Centurion\\" takes place circa 117-122 AD in Great Britain and speculates the fate of the Roman 9th Legion, which disappeared at the time and remains a mystery to this day.<br /><br />PLOT: Seven legion survivors of a surprise Pictish attack go into enemy territory to retrieve their general (Dominic West). The legionnaires then go deeper into the wilderness to escape the vengeance of the Picts with the intention of looping back around. Unfortunately for them, the Picts have an expert tracker on hand; a mute woman with whom the Romans are quite familiar.<br /><br />ANALYSIS: Michael Fassbender is outstanding as the leader of the remaining legionnaires, Quintus Dias, while Olga Kurylenko is effective as the vengeful Pict tracker, Etain, and Imogen Poots shines as an outcast in the wilderness, Arianne.<br /><br />The scenery of the film is breathtaking, shot on location in England and Scotland, whilst the pace is brisk at a mere 97 minutes. The latter reveals the weakness of the film as this is definitely a tale that would've worked better at 2 hours minimum. Although there are some quality character-defining sequences and near-epic moments, the film needed more. As it is, it's kind of a blur, but still very worthwhile. The score's quite good as well.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: \\"Centurion\\" is reminiscent of 2004's \\"King Arthur,\\" as far as story, location and overall tone go. The main difference is that the events in \\"King Arthur\\" take place 350 years later and involve the legendary Arthur as a Roman warrior. \\"Centurion,\\" by contrast, occurs when Hadrian's Wall was just starting to materialize. Both films are worthwhile to sword & sandal devotees, but \\"King Arthur\\" ultimately plays better due to its longer runtime and therefore more characterization and epic-ness.<br /><br />Be sure to catch 2011's \\"The Eagle,\\" which is essentially the (unofficial) sequel to \\"Centurion\\" where the son of the general of the 9th legion ventures into the Pictish wilderness with a Briton slave to regain the 9th legion's gold eagle standard. \\"The Eagle\\" is less Hollywoodized, has a much better first act and is all-around more realistic, but \\"Centurion\\" is more conventionally entertaining, has important female characters and a superior last act.<br /><br />GRADE: B+<br /><br />*** SPOILERS FOLLOW***<br /><br />One reviewer complained that the film fails to provide conventional protagonists: How can you root for the Romans when they're the invading army who were responsible for raping Etain when she was a girl, killing her parents, and cutting out her tongue? In addition, at least one legionnaire is revealed to be a total scumbag. But then it's hard to root for the Picts since Etain is so bitter and vengeful, plus the Picts are pretty much portrayed as the antagonists to the remaining members of the 9th legion.<br /><br />I would argue that the film encourages us to disregard political loyalties (Roman, Pict or otherwise) and root for the persons worthy of rooting for. In this case, Quintus Dias and Arianne (the \\"witch\\"). Why? Because they both prove to have hearts of gold, which is one of the reasons they're so drawn to each other, beyond the physical attraction.<br /><br />As for the film's message, it's driven home at the end: Big government is not worthy of your absolute loyalty and service because they'll throw you to the wolves in a second if it serves their purposes. (Government in general is good and necessary but big government is intrinsically untrustworthy and harmful, i.e. evil).ndard. \\"The Eagle\\" is less Hollywoodized, has a much better first act and is all-around more realistic, but \\"Centurion\\" is more conventionally entertaining, has important female characters and a superior last act.

In addition, at least one legionnaire is revealed to be a total scumbag. But then it's hard to root for the Picts since Etain is so bitter and vengeful, plus the Picts are pretty much portrayed as the antagonists to the remaining members of the 9th legion.    I would argue that the film encourages us to disregard political loyalties (Roman, Pict or otherwise) and root for the persons worthy of rooting for. In this case, Quintus Dias and Arianne (the \\"witch\\"). Why? Because they both prove to have hearts of gold, which is one of the reasons they're so drawn to each other, beyond the physical attraction.    As for the film's message, it's driven home at the end: Big government is not worthy of your absolute loyalty and service because they'll throw you to the wolves in a second if it serves their purposes. (Government in general is good and necessary but big government is intrinsically untrustworthy and harmful, i.e. evil).
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the gorgeous sounds and being able to mix them.  I always fall to sleep using Urban Rain and Thunder.
B003UESJJC|5.0|This product blew me away. \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" is a must see for any lover of film. If you weren't overwhelmed or in awe of the film before, you will be after watching this. The packaging design is beautiful as well. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a recommendation from my aunt & I loved it! It was twisted and kept you guessing. Over all very entertaining and I will certainly recommend this to others.

B008AT71WI|5.0|Once upon a time I wrote a review begging for a director's cut of this film, making the original ending available to us true fans who have been craving it since the original release. It seemed from all the information available all these years that it would never be possible as the original footage was lost or damaged or whatever. As one of the few people who actually spent over $100 to acquire the original DVD release of this film with the crappy black and white ending included on it I am SO glad to finally find out tonight that the footage was safe and sound after all and is now going to be released in full color HD to it's adoring public. This has always been one of my favorite movies and to know that I'll be able to watch it in it's original form is going to be quite a treat. Thank you so much to whomever is responsible for making this happen!!

B007IX383I|5.0|One can view Anathema's career trajectory as a passionate evolution from a sorrowful awareness of life's tragedy and despair to a blissful embrace of the beauty and joy of living; from mournful realization to ethereal transcendence. Their ninth album, Weather Systems, continues the life-affirming sound and concept of We're Here Because We're Here, but achieves an even more inspirational, enveloping, uplifting sound, as well as a more consistently engaging quality of songwriting, substantially correcting the mostly inconsequential imperfections of the previous album. The songs are more unified to the album's defining theme, the connection between natural landscapes, universal forces, and the introspective thought patterns of the human mind. The sound is even more resplendent, continuously ascending in sonorous atmospheres towards realizations of overwhelming beauty.<br /><br />\\"Inside this cold heart is a dream<br />that's locked in a box that I keep<br />buried a hundred miles deep<br />deep in my soul in a place that's surrounded by aeons of silence\\"<br /><br />The intuitional composition identifiable in this band's music from their origins emphasizes radiant melodies and perceptive arrangements, fueled by the primary intention to elevate the emotions of the listener, to direct one's thoughts to the deepest awareness of pure feeling and establish a more intimate connection with the soul in universal and individual experience. Impassioned and dynamic melodies weave their way through elegant structures in penetrating songs of breathtaking beauty. Throughout the album, the band demonstrates their familiar remarkable application of contrasting elements, each song reflecting in its form a harmony of contradictions, darkness and illumination, the joy of new beginnings and the sorrow of departure, delightful wonder and dreadful recognition. Lushly orchestrated in elaborate yet elegant forms, the songs captivate through melody and expansive atmosphere, wonderfully enhancedby exquisite orchestral arrangements and gorgeous vocal harmonies. The music is overflowing with vivid power and compelling emotional intensity, consistently rising towards epic culminations. The opening two-part \\"Untouchable\\", \\"Lightning Song\\", \\"Sunlight\\", \\"The Beginning and the End\\", and \\"The Lost Child\\" each build to incredible passionate charges before gliding to a fading reflection. They create spectacular soundscapes, particularly the vast 9-minute journey \\"The Storm Before the Calm\\", which expands from the dark, anxious suspense of its first half into a blossoming, spacious, magnificent revelation. What they aimed for as a finale for We're Here Because We're Here is more effectively achieved with the closing \\"Internal Landscapes\\", which perceptively employs a sampled spoken word piece (Joe Geraci's account of a near-death experience) as an introductory establishment of the song's melancholic yet heartfelt mood, which develops into an overwhelmingly emotional and vastly atmospheric track that provides the album a fantastic sense of closure, bringing together the album's themes in a final resolution of acceptance, belief, love, power, awakening...everything. As always anticipated with Anathema, these are emotionally challenging songs, but the inspirational harmonic quality and the vibrancy of melodic enrichment has not been this brilliant since 1999's Judgement.<br /><br />\\"Fight for what you believe in<br />Dare to live your dream<br />In this life don't be afraid of yourself<br />Don't be afraid\\"<br /><br />The splendid vocal harmonies are the band's best yet. The sparkling voice of Lee Douglas is given a more substantial role on this album, providing a more pronounced source of expressive variety. She shines gloriously as the lead voice in \\"Lightning Song\\", perhaps her best work since joining Anathema. Vincent Cavanagh's voice is strong, confident, richly expressive, completely unified with the emotional fabric of each song's melodic definition, particularly in \\"Untouchable Part 1\\" and \\"Internal Landscapes\\", beautifully accompanied and accented by Douglas. In \\"The Beginning and the End\\" and \\"The Lost Child\\", his voice gradually rises in tone from clam awareness to desperate pleading, reminiscent of his performance on classics such as \\"One Last Goodbye\\" and \\"Inner Silence\\". The tender dialogue between the singers in \\"Untouchable Part 2\\" enhances the somber beauty of the song, while in \\"The Gathering of the Clouds\\" they soar in melodic tandem over a fast-picked acoustic guitar, demonstrating excellent harmonic diversity. Guitarist Daniel Cavanagh takes the lead vocal role in the shimmering \\"Sunlight\\", his gentle and soothing expression outshining any of his previous performances as a lead vocalist. Daniel's guitar-work is phenomenal throughout, from his delicate acoustic finger-picking in \\"Untouchable Part 1\\", \\"Lightning Song\\" and \\"Sunlight\\", to his immaculate clean guitar melodies and his soulful, yearning solo in \\"The Beginning and the End\\". The past decade of Anathema music has been tragically deprived of Daniel's utterly fantastic solos, and his work in \\"The Beginning and the End\\" ranks among his best. The London session orchestra adds a variety of light and shade to defining melodies of guitar, piano, and vocals, arranged to subtly enhance rather than establish a song's primary theme. John Douglas provides the supporting foundation to this ethereal and elegant sound, bringing a much-needed dimension of rhythmic stability and force. His intense, frantic percussive energy in \\"Lightning Song\\" and \\"Sunlight\\" elevates the music with vibrant power. Anathema's music is all about melody and atmosphere, but the rhythmic constructions ground these components in the reality of motion; the music moves in a reflection of life's fluctuating patterns, dynamically portraying the relation between movements of thoughts and feelings, and the actions arising therefrom.<br /><br />\\"Time is not what it would seem<br />The life we live is like a dream<br />Release belief, let it wash over me<br />Let love reveal what I feel\\"<br /><br />Blessed with their most representative and detailed studio production, Weather Systems is yet another musical advancement for Anathema. Like every other album they've released, it is purposeful, emotional, sincere, and the result of marvelous artistic vision. Though they have increasingly adapted their approach to a more accessible style, they have appropriated only the most ambitious ranges of the popular form, while managing to completely avoid the superficial appeal, emotional vacancy, and evasive apathy associated with mainstream music. In fact, one could make the case that this is Anathema's most expansive work of emotional resolution. Their program has developed into an embrace of life as a whole, with all of its affections, sorrows, joy and sadness, driven by a genuine desire to relate the essential human realities of life and death, longing and energy, and the profound inner dimensions of the spirit. Once fearing and mourning the inevitability of death, Anathema now accepts death as a fundamental part of human experience from which one can discover a sublime awareness of the preciousness of a life so full of hopes and dreams, yet so fragile and fleeting. Yes, they have found faith in love, not in the shallow sense of the typical romantic pop-song, but in the energy of human affection that makes one feel like it can never end, the connection that exposes the principle of individuation as an illusion and transforms fear into inspiration. This is an exceptional album from a continuously amazing band, music that radiates meaningful artistic creation and a passion for the beauty and power of musical expression.
0446547573|5.0|Katie has a secret.  A twisted, dark, horrible secret that she's keeping from the townsfolk of her latest locale of refuge.  Life is finally almost normal, or as akin to normal as her nightmares and well-founded paranoia allow things to be for her, but she knows deep within that it will be short-lived.  It always is.  He always finds her, and any chance for peace or happiness - for freedom - will be once again be stripped from her.<br />With the friendship of a neighbor who seems to mysteriously come and go, and the budding romance with a widower and father of two children she's quickly falling in love with, \\"Katie\\" allows herself to get comfortable and to actually hope for normalcy.  Maybe he's not looking for her, this time.  Maybe he's given up.  Maybe this once... just this once... he won't find her.  But he does, and there's hell to pay.  Not just physically, but emotionally, for everyone involved.<br />This was a wonderful story, not surprisingly, because of Mr. Sparks' style as well as his innate ability to capture the reader's emotional need to relate to a situation presented -or a specific character- personally.  I read this on a flight from Seattle to Phoenix... 2 1/2 hours.  I couldn't stop, thankfully not earning the attention of any stewardesses or cabinmates, as my breath caught from time to time throughout the pages.  Mr. Sparks, yet again, has come through and created a work I will be sharing with others and re-reading with both eagerness and tempered joy.
0061726834|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this book.  The author did such an amazing job with a different plot.  When I first started reading this book, I thought \\"how corny is this going to be\\"?  I mean love actually being removed from people, a criminal offence etc...  However, the deeper I got the more enthralled I was with the story.<br /><br />The characters are realistic, loveable and easy to associate with.  The relationship between the two main characters; Lena and Alex, is truly interesting.  A successful portrait of first love and its emotions.  From the sweaty palms to the stomach butterflies, the author managed to capture it all.  By the end of the book, you can actually feel the emotion and I for one find the intensity a rarity with many of the novels of today.<br /><br />This first installment surpassed my expectations, from the vivid details to the characters and their interactions.  There was action, romance, drama and weirdness all wrapped into one.  I would highly recommend this book, as well as this series to anyone.

B004NCLKJG|3.0|Based on some of the reviews I'd seen, I expected much more than this recording delivered.  Of course, most of the singers are wonderful, but all can be heard to (much) better advantage in other recordings that are currently available, so why bother?  And while Klobucar's conducting is good - and very good or maybe even excellent in some parts - it's not really worth the price of admission, particularly given the mediocre sound quality.<br /><br />Nilsson is, well, Nilsson, but she's much better on any one of a number of recordings, including those conducted by Solti, Bohm and Leinsdorf, all of which are also well conducted (at a minimum) and have far superior sound quality.  (I have to mention that my other personal favorite is the extraordinarily womanly Brunnhilde, Regine Crespin, on the Karajan recording - it's too often overlooked and is simply wonderful.)<br /><br />The same is true of Jon Vickers - fabulous here, but equally so on other recordings (again, with better sound quality) - Thomas Stewart and Christa Ludwig too.  Which leaves us with Leonie Rysanek.  While I tend to have mixed feelings about her singing depending on which recording I'm listening to, she sounds somewhat gravelly and a bit matronly here - and her recording with Karl Bohm is better (and, again, has better sound).<br /><br />So I'm left with a question as to why anyone would buy this.  As the owner of several recordings of Walkure (including those mentioned above), I'm not likely to listen to this.  And if I were an opera or Wagner newbie, this would not be my first choice.  I'm glad that my purchase of this recording may have benefited the Metropolitan Opera, but that may not be a sufficient reason for others to indulge.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|At least, that's what the Relax Melodies Premium app does for me. When I get into bed I usually choose one of the super relaxing sleep rhythms, plug in my headphones and set the built-in timer.

B0088X7YMS|2.0|Disappointing addition to STARSHIP TROOPER franchise.  Why is this movie so bad? Boring, yet gratuitous CGI nudity.  Pointless plot is not related to anything in THIS franchise (\\"bugs take over spaceship -- just blow it away with your zillions of other spaceships -- no wait, then we would have no movie\\") BUT could well have been named ALIEN RESURRECTION REDUX.  CGI looks like ASSASSIN'S CREED cutscenes not like APPLESEED or a good CGI film.  In particular, the CGI artists have a real problem with fabric so all of the \\"costumes\\" (not \\"uniforms\\") in the film shine like they are made of plastic. I know the ROUGHNECKS TV show had the same problem, but that was many years ago.  The most annoying part is that this movie was supposed to use the same characters and stuff as the original BUT DOESN'T.  The actors voices are different.  The character designs look nothing like the original -- Johnny Rico is now David Hasselhoff's Nick Fury -- Carl Jenkins is taken from ROUGHNECKS -- the female characters, regardless of age, all look like the cover of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW.  All of the rich uniform, weapon, spaceship, and prop designs of the original have been thrown away and replaced by \\"new\\" designs based on \\"superhero\\" video games (which is why you have \\"costumes\\" not \\"uniforms\\").  Massively oversized weapons taken from WARHAMMER board game.  Only the music and the mobile infantry logo is retained from the original.
1936891026|5.0|For me, this book has been a revelation, and I will probably read it a second time because it really is a true energy booster!<br />This author says truth after truth, like if he was reading in my mind, in spite of the fact he is a man, and I am a woman.<br />It is also a very smart book, very interesting, we learn at each page, what doesn't mean it is annoying or difficult to read, not at all. I read it very easily but at every page, I was thinking how smart this guy is!<br />It is not a book to tell you how to make 6 figures incomes or how it is easy to make some money with no effort at all, no, no, actually this book changes you and pushes you to make efforts, but like an urgent need, reveals what is important in your way of doing or why you do it wrong, or even why you don't do it at all.<br />It is like if I've been fighting with myself all my life, and this guy arrives, says a few things, and suddenly, I understand it all, and there is no need to fight anymore, I just want to act and do now!<br />This author is also very sincere and honest, and direct, and true, it is easy to believe him, because what he says about himself, happened to us as well, so for the reader, it is easy to relate to his ideas.<br />This book is extraordinary! This author should have a price, or a crown or something for having written it, especially when you know that he considered himself like a loser writer almost all his life!<br />He made a huge effort and gave birth to this treasure, it is amazing! I admire him.<br />If you want to improve your life and understand who you are, get some help by a smart and useful way, read this book now.<br />I will keep it forever. It has been recommended to me by a friend, and I won't thank this friend enough to have done so.<br />It is a must-have absolutely! This book is a true gift for the Humanity.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A riveting book that makes you laugh and cry - sometimes at the same time.  The author does a wonderful job of telling a true story about a hero that struggles with his demons and within all of it continues to strive for and grow in virtue.

030758836X|4.0|On the day of Nick and Amy's fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears. There are signs of a struggle in their house and no sign or sighting of Amy.<br />While Nick calls the police as soon as he finds his house with the front door still open and his living-room turned upside down he doesn't appear as shocked or worried as you might expect. And he is lying to the police. Half way through the day of his wife's disappearance Nick says: \\"It was my fifth lie to the police. I was just starting.\\"<br />It isn't long before Nick becomes the main suspect in Amy's disappearance and his actions in the subsequent days do nothing to take that suspicion away. In fact, the longer Amy is gone the guiltier Nick appears to be.<br />As in alternating chapters we are told Nick's story during the days following his wife's disappearance, in his own words, as well as the story of Amy and Nick's relationship through years worth of diary entries by Amy, the picture of a troubled and rather unbalanced relationship emerges. And as the police investigates, Nick is discovering things about his wife and her life that are completely new to him and as far as he is concerned, completely out of character for the Amy he knows. By the time the first part of the story ends Nick is up to his neck in trouble with hardly anybody on his side and an increasing number of clues pointing at his guilt.<br /><br />And that is all I can say about this story without spoiling it for other readers. Because this is a book in which nothing is what it seems. A story in which shock follows shock and the reader is constantly second guessing events and revelations.<br /><br />It is amazing how hard it is to write a positive review about a story in which I distinctly dislike both the main characters. Even though I know the book is exceptionally well written and the story is compelling and addictive in the same way a natural disaster can be, the descriptions and actions of Amy and Nick still make me want to slam the book. And that would be so unfair. Because this is an absolutely fascinating story. The tension is palatable, the undercurrents treacherous and it very soon becomes clear to the reader that nothing either Nick or Amy shares with them can be trusted.<br />Yes, I did want to throw the book at the wall on several occasions and just stop reading it. As I've said in previous reviews, I have an issue with books in which I can't relate to any of the main characters (think The Corrections by Jonathan Frenzen) and tend to give up on them rather than struggle on. Giving up on this book was never an option though. I had to know what exactly was going on, what had happened to Amy and why. I couldn't stop reading until I found out how the story would end.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn is very good at grabbing her readers and keeping them hooked. Nick and Amy may not be sympathetic characters but they are fascinating in a scary sort of way. And Flynn is a very good writer. The sentences flow, the tension is built up at a steady pace and questions are introduced and answered at exactly the right time.<br /><br />This is a good thriller, although certain aspects of the book made it feel more like a horror story. This is a book for anyone who likes their stories well plotted, dark and memorable.d that would be so unfair. Because this is an absolutely fascinating story.

B004LWZW7E|1.0|This was a very boring movie.  I really can't blame all of the actors because I have watched some of them in other movies and they were great.  I have to place 99.99% of the blame on the writer, director and producer of this movie.  It was like reading an essay that had no plot or strong storyline to it.  It was a waste of my time.  This movie is almost as bad as Tom Cruise 'Eyes Wide Shut'.  I truly hate that movie with a passion.  Don't waste your money or time watching this movie.  This movie had potential to be a good movie, but that's all it had...potential..I would have rather watched paint dry on a wall then to have wasted my valuable time watching this sorry movie.
B008BM9L72|4.0|My initial impressions were not very high as I thought the story was going to be a bit of a 'Mills and Boon' type romance, not particularly well written.<br />I persisted and was definitely rewarded. It has interesting characters, a level of suspense that keeps you hooked till the very end and soft porn which is both educational and very entertaining. I must say I found it hard to put down!<br />It is worth buying the trilogy - I found I was keen to get into the second and third books and these were better than the first.<br />I was sad to finish this series - I hope there is more to come about the life of the Christian and Ana - it was certainly finished with the opportunity for more!
B007JF87VS|5.0|I am excited about this episode, because even though AMC fired series creator Frank Darabont and therefore Season Two has not been the same as Season One, on this episode, we have as director Guy Ferland, who directed the finale of Season One, and Executive Producer Glen Mazzara as Co-Writer, so I'm crossing my fingers it will be a good one. And after watching it, I can say it truly was. I wish that these two would work together more often!<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Opening<br /><br />It opens with Dale's funeral, against a backdrop of Shane, Daryl, Andrea and T-Dog hunting and killing zombies. The creek is drying up; the creek was causing the zombies to get stuck and keeping them away from the house, but that is starting to change.<br /><br />Between the new zombie threat and colder weather, Hershel has agreed that they can move into the house. Rick has also assigned tighter security outside.<br /><br />Carl confides in Shane -- as long as Shane doesn't tell his parents -- that he stole Daryl's gun and that it is his fault Carl is dead. He tells Shane about how he taunted the zombie, the zombie broke free and he meant to shoot it but didn't and it killed Carl. He says he never wants to shoot a gun again and to give the gun back to Daryl.<br /><br />T-Dog discovers Randall missing from the holding cell with the cuffs still hooked in the cell. We next see Shane pulling Randall through the woods, asking him where the rival group is. Randall says they are about 5 miles away and starts to lead Shane to them, and says that Shane will like living with them. Then Shane kills Randall and head butts him.<br /><br />Back at camp, people are swarming looking for Randall. We see Shane watching the group from the woods with blood on his face. Shane hides his gun in the ground, then shouts to the group that Randall is armed, has his gun, and clocked Shane in the face. Rick and Shane pair off and T-Dog and Glenn pair off to search for Randall. It is all an elaborateruse so that Shane can get Rick alone to murder him.<br /><br />Daryl finds Randall and figures everything out. He knows Rick is in danger. Randall inexplicably reanimates as a walker but died from a broken neck.<br /><br />The scene where Rick has to murder Shane is unforgettable. We know it is going to change Rick, irrevocably, forever. Harden him in a way that we have never before seen. It is heartbreaking. I have always loved that vulnerable, sweet side of Rick. He makes the hard decisions but also has a conscience. After tonight, innocence is lost.<br /><br />Shane inexplicably reanimates as a zombie. Carl shows up and kills Shane the zombie. Awesome.<br /><br />In the final scene, a hoard of zombies is closing in on Carl and Rick as grieving Rick bends over Shane's dead body, so they don't know the hoard is coming.

B007M6P01O|5.0|A five-star episode. If they could all be this way!<br /><br />Again another great pairing from Season One makes me excited for this episode. Why can't AMC do this with every episode? They fired Frank Darabont, but if you notice, every time they pair a writer or director combo from Season One, the episode is better. This time we have director Ernest Dickerson, who directed episode five of Season One, paired with not one, but TWO writers from Season One -- Robert Kirkman and Executive Producer for Season Two Glen Mazzara.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Episode recap:<br /><br />A hoard of zombies follows a helicopter trail from the city into the country. The gunshot leads them to where Rick shot Shane. Now Rick and Carl are being pursued by this huge hoard of zombies that invade the farm. Rick and Shane lead some of them into a barn and set the barn on fire. The group fights them off. Hershel says he will die before giving up his land.<br /><br />But there are too many zombies overpowering them. They have to flee. Everyone gets out except Patricia, who is killed, Andrea, who finds herself without a vehicle. Rick gets Hershel to leave. Daryl rescues Carol.<br /><br />Andrea runs on foot off the farm and is miraculously rescued, after running out of ammunition, by a mysterious hooded figure.<br /><br />Rick goes back to the spot Carol set up on the highway to meet Sophia. The remaining survivors make it back. Not everyone. Then they all drive away, as they need to stay off the main roads.<br /><br />Rick runs out of gas. The caravan is in a vulnerable place. They plan to find a place to hunker down for the night and then set out again tomorrow after finding more gas and supplies.<br /><br />Daryl shares with the group that Randall was a walker but wasn't bitten and that Shane killed him. Rick still hasn't told the group what happened with Shane.<br /><br />Rick now shares something the CDC told him.<br /><br />\\"We're all infected,\\" he says. \\"Whatever it is, we all carry it.\\" Carol and Glenn jump on him for not telling them sooner \\"for the good of everyone.\\" Rick says, \\"I thought it best that people didn't know.\\" He walks off like the weight of the world is on his shoulders. Everyone has been looking to him for answers to everything and it is clear that he is exhausted from the burden. The group also has trusted him less and less over time, questioning his decisions more and more, with the exception of Hershel and Daryl.<br /><br />He confesses to his wife that he killed Shane and that he's glad Shane is dead. That he wanted it to happen. That he was tired of Shane dogging him and tired of Shane acting like it was his wife and child. He says that \\"Carl put him down\\" when Shane turned into a walker. Lori recoils from Rick, disgusted. Rick doesn't look like he cares what she thinks. He almost looks like Shane at this point, a little insane.<br /><br />Rick at this point is a lot more blunt and pointed with his words. He isn't as kind; not as soft-spoken. He doesn't care as much about people's feelings. He still cares about keeping people safe, but I think at this point Rick's own feelings are getting blunted by being a survivor for so long.<br /><br />People hear something moving in the dark outside camp. They talk about leaving camp and going somewhere safer. Rick demands that they stay. Rick says he never asked to be leader. He tells them about Shane. He shows them the door and says they are welcome to leave, but that if they choose to stay, that this isn't a Democracy anymore. They look afraid of him. This is a new Rick.<br /><br />THOUGHTS ON SEASON TWO:<br /><br />As Season Two draws to a close, one has to question the overall quality of the Season Two versus Season One. It just hasn't been there. And that is due to large part from AMC's firing of show creator and director Frank Darabont. If one reads about AMC's very public problems with its shows Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the Walking Dead is just another casualty onthe list.<br /><br />Frank Darabont was as irreplaceable to The Walking Dead as Gene Roddenberry was to Star Trek. But AMC did not see that, and the quality of Season Two suffered as a result. It is still watchable, but it was not the same as Season One. Fans adjusted, but no one can tell me that these episodes we have been watching are the same in quality. The budget has been slashed, the writing is not the same, and it shows.<br /><br />AMC appears to have saved the entire season's budget for the finale episode. It was a great episode, AMC. Now bring us every episode exactly like it. You're getting the viewership. You're getting the advertisements. You have no excuse not to bring us the goods.<br /><br />AMC, bring us writers and directors from Seaon One. It may cost a little more, but it is worth it.<br /><br />From now on any original series on AMC should have a third party owning the series: that way the cast and crew have some protection from AMC's budget slashing and firing and unreasonable demands on the set, which have been well-documented on shows such as Mad Men and Breaking Bad. It is unfortunate that we the public have to suffer as a result. I wonder what kind of series we would have gotten if Frank Darabont HAD been at the helm.
0143121006|3.0|Mr. French did a wonderful job of depicting the unique world that was pre-WWII Peking.  It was a seedy place full of intrigue, crime, and misery, and included a truly divided colonial society.  And central to that description is the brutal murder of a young woman.  The story and the investigation are peeled apart and are quite interesting, until the end of the book, when, in my opinion, the author tries to wrap it all up in a neat little package by adding details and bits of story that he could not know.  Instead of labeling this last bit of the book as conjecture, or the most likely version of what happened, it is written as the last hours of the victim--a great leap of faith.
B007H51DQG|4.0|Overall, Season Two continues at a much slower pace than Season One. There still is more dialog and more filler in the episodes. It is not the way series creator Frank Darabont would have written or directed the series if AMC hadn't fired him.<br /><br />Still, this episode was okay as I compare it to other Season Two episodes.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Now for a recap:<br /><br />In this episode, we start with a brutal torturing of Randall as Daryl attempts to learn more about the rival gang. Daryl finds out there are about 30 of them and they like to rape women and children and have machine guns. A dangerous group. Carl sneaks in and Randall almost convinces Carl to let him go before Shane shows up and beats the crap out of him.<br /><br />The group is trying to decide by sunset whether or not to let Randall live. Rick is afraid he will go back to his camp and lead the rival group to the farm and he thinks Randall should die. Carl thinks Randall should live and tries to drum up votes. He goes to Daryl, who has alienated himself more and more from the group. Daryl is disgusted by how he perceives Rick has turned a blind eye to Shane killing Otis.<br /><br />Shane discusses overthrowing Rick's reign with Andrea, especially if Rick doesn't kill Randall. They talk about gathering everyone's guns and locking everyone in the house.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Rick is looking for a suitable hanging place for Randall and looks at a high rafter in a barn. He tells Lori, \\"I know how you feel about the death penalty.\\" This is like the Wild West and as close as they get to \\"Judge, Jury and Executioner\\" as they have no more courts system, and no trial. They are going to decide by sunset what to do with Randall.<br /><br />Carl talks back to Carol and tells her she's an idiot for believing in Heaven and that Sophia is not better off dead. Carol tells Rick and Lori they need to control their child. Rick has a talk with Carl and says he needs to think before he speaks, and that he owes Carol an apology. Carl asks Rick if they are going to hang Randall in the barn. Carl wanders off and stops by where Daryl has been staying. He takes a gun from Daryl. He wanders into the woods and sees a zombie. The zombie is stuck in the mud. Carl begins throwing rocks at the zombie.<br /><br />Dale tries to convince Shane to change his vote on Randall. Shane refuses. Shane says that if Dale does get the votes to keep Randall alive, if and when Randall kills someone, the death will be on Dale's head.<br /><br />Carl continues messing with the zombie in the swamp until he is at arm's length from him. He holds the gun up as if to shoot him. The zombie breaks free, Carl slips and the zombie grabs him. Carl loses the gun in the forest and barely escapes with his life.<br /><br />It is now sunset and time for a decision to be made about Randall. Everyone has gathered into the house for a meeting / to take a vote. Everyone is in favor of killing Randall except for Dale. They discuss keeping him prisoner, but argue he could run off. Dale argues they are killing him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt (bringing back the 30 men, the rival gang, to their farm). They make the decision to execute him.<br /><br />Later, in the dark, a very determined Rick presses a revolver against Randall's head in the barn when suddenly his son appears in the barn doorway saying, \\"Do it, Dad. Go on. Do it.\\" At this moment, Rick completely breaks down and is unable to continue. He says, \\"Take him away,\\" meaning Randall. He looks at his son with tears in his eyes. He didn't want his son to see him as a cold-blooded murderer. He didn't want to think of himself as one.<br /><br />Rick goes back to the expectant group, that is waiting on tenderhooks for news, and he announces, \\"We're keeping him in custody for now.\\" Andrea immediately bolts, saying, \\"I'm going to find Dale.\\" His wife looks at Rick and wants an explanation. Rick says about Carl, \\"He followed us. He wanted to watch. I couldn't ...\\" His wife finally understands. She says, \\"That's okay.\\"<br /><br />Dale is out on a walk. He encounters the zombie that Carl inadvertently freed while he was cruelly torturing it earlier in the woods. The zombie attacks and mortally wounds Dale. Everyone comes running. They call for Hershel. Hershel takes one look at Dale and realizes there is nothing he can do to save Dale. Rick, without hesitating, is going to shoot Dale in the head to put him out of his misery. But Daryl, somehow realizing the huge burden that has been placed upon Rick's shoulders, stands up and does it for him. \\"Sorry, brother,\\" he says to Dale, as we hear the shot ring out and the screen goes black.<br /><br />Overall, I find the characters likeable, but the lengthy dialog scenes and the lack of action make me almost fall asleep at times. This is a far cry from Season One. While I find the show interesting, it is not a \\"must watch\\" as it was in Season One.
0307959856|3.0|Death Comes to Pemberley by P.D. James is an amusing read, if also a somewhat annoying one. To her credit, the author neatly builds upon the characters of Pride and Prejudice, with a passing reference to characters in Persuasion and Emma, to amplify the original story and extend it with a murder mystery. If you can overcome your natural objection to P.D. James messing with Jane Austen's work, you will find that it was neatly done in this instance. This book is a quick and easy read. The character of Wickham is at the heart of the story, and he is predictably, but intriguingly, bad. The details that P.D. James adds to his life after Pride and Prejudice, his connection to the nefarious Mrs. Younge, and the future that she envisions for him all ring true. Less successful to me was the snarky way James treats Mary, admittedly a minor character, and Col. Fitzwilliam, who, as the result of an inheritance becomes unexpectedly less likable. Elizabeth, Darcy, Jane and Bingley all seemed familiar and well drawn. Lydia was, perhaps, too histrionic, and ridiculous. James grafts a very nice love story into the book involving Georgianna, who is all grown up now. I felt, at times, that James was mocking all of the characters not just some of them as Austen would have done. While the mystery surrounding the murder was enjoyable, I'm not convinced that the murderer was well portrayed. Still, this was a fun read and a plausible extension of Austen's work.

B007A4SDCG|5.0|I bought The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield based upon a recommendation by Joe Rogan from Mr. Rogan's podcast. I admit a small reluctance to the purchase as my only writing background was as a reporter for my law school newspaper. With this background, what could I gain from this book? The answer came to me quite quickly upon the read. His discussion of the procrastination-building and ennui-inducing powers which hinder our chosen endeavors is relatable to affairs of art, affairs of the heart, your career and your overall enjoyment of life. He calls this power \\"resistance,\\" and I was able to extrapolate a solid program to overcome resistance to my many endeavors through his discussion. I read and re-read this book in two days. It is an engaging read, and I highly recommend it.
0307352145|4.0|This book was truly fascinating. And I really wish I had had enough time to finish it before moving to Africa. But I read a majority of it and am looking forward to borrowing it next summer from the friend I gave it to.<br /><br />For various reasons I was expecting this book to be written from a biblical worldview, but it's not. The book isn't against the Bible or Christianity. It's just that I was expecting something that didn't turn out to be true.<br /><br />The author does address how introverts and those more on the quiet side might feel excluded by some churches - especially big churches. That's one reason why I believe it's very important to have greeters at every door. But the people in the pews (more often chairs these days) need to be a bit more friendly to those around them as well.<br /><br />It doesn't take long to realize that the author put a lot of research and thought into this book. There are many, many examples both from her personal life and from things most everyone comes in contact. She also traces how over the past century America has come to value extroversion more highly than introversion and she contrasts that with other societies that are opposite.<br /><br />The writing is not dry, the stories keep you reading and there is practical advice scattered throughout. Both introverts and extroverts can benefit from Quiet.
B002ZG4Q5W|4.0|I give this Studio Canal edition of Kurosawa's masterwork only four starts, because of the poor transfer. I would have given six stars to the disc content, if it was allowed to separate the artistic and technical components.<br /><br />What to say about the movie? A great epic, mixing Shakespeare and Aeschylus in a sometimes magniloquent and rethoric, but breathless narrative. Historic reconstruction at its best, terrifying war sequences, stunning acting (nuances are reserved to secundary roles, like the princesses: the Great Prince being the simulacra of the cruel man in the classic theatre).<br /><br />With Ran also comes A.K., a magnificent documentary shot by Chris Marker during the film making. Do not expect the classic, uninspired documentary format that prevails today: this is a movie made of fog and mud, whispers, long tele shots of Kurosawa directing. A great movie given away as a bonus!<br /><br />Very interesting is the documentary on the samurais; more classic, but extremely solid and informative. A must-see for lovers of the ancient art of the war.<br /><br />Shame the image quality is so poor. Iris changing, definition sometimes not much better than a DVD. For a classic with the highest photo quality (and the last work of the great Asakazu Nakai) this is really not accettable.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app has saved me from running my battery dead so many times I should be the developers poster boy. I've had such good performance with it that I have the paid version on my Galaxy Note.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read the reviews here before I read the book so I didn't have huge expectations.  At least I wasn't let down.<br /><br />I got sucked into the hype so I just \\"had\\" to read this book.  The writing was awful and honestly I've read better adult novels.  I felt like I was reading something written by a teenager that can't describe their body parts using the correct terminology, instead saying things like \\"down there\\".  It was so frustrating.  The worst part is that I got into the storyline and ended up reading all three books in less than a week.  By the third book I found myself skipping all the sex scenes just to get back to the story.
0007145713|5.0|I really liked this book. Easy to read. Concise,inspirational words of wisdom that can be used daily or whenever one needs encouragement or positive affirmation on life's journey. A bedside book. A companion handbook or a gift to a friend.

1439193630|5.0|As an author I absorbed so much from this book, at times it was like sitting with Stephen King having a cup of coffee while he personally told you what he thought would help you most.  He offers casual honest advice, especially about the little things you never think of, and insights about many of the books he's written and what contributed to them.  I originally checked out On Writing from the library but realized there was so much I wanted to highlight that I returned it and bought my own copy.  A must-have for all writers.<br /><br />Jennifer A. Slater<br />Author, \\"En Route Baby: What You Need to Know<br />  In Case Baby Arrives Before Help Does\\"<br />[...]
0307592731|5.0|I absolutely loved \\"Wild\\" and honestly didn't want it to end. I suppose for me, it has to do with the fact that I have always wanted to hike the PCT but never have. And to find a woman who actually set out on her own to hike it, well, I guess I was living the trail through her, because I myself never would have had the courage to hike it alone.<br /><br />I read a couple of the 1 star reviews to see how anyone could think so little of this book as to give it only 1 star. From what I read, it seems that those who didn't like it were really judging the author and her choices in life and maybe the choices of what she shared in this book. True, I wouldn't have made the same choices she made such as taking a box of condoms along on the trail, anticipating having sex with men along the way, but it was who she was at the time.<br /><br />I loved the way Cheryl wrote this book. The incident with having to kill the horse made me weep because I know how difficult that had to have been. But I believe it played a major role in letting go of a bit of her mother after her mother died of cancer at a young age. It was her mother's horse and she could then imagine her mother's spirit riding away on her beloved horse, the 2 of them together forever.<br /><br />Some mentioned how Cheryl got off track when she should have stuck to the story of the trail hike. I disagree. I thought everything she \\"veered off the trail\\" to talk about gave a little more insight into who she really was and why she felt or thought a certain way about something. She never lost me and always got right back to where she left off on the trail.<br /><br />I really didn't want the book to end. I was hiking the PCT vicariously through her and didn't want to get back to the city life. But every trail and every story has a beginning and an end and so, like Cheryl, I have to get back to real life in the real world. But she inspired me, and who knows, maybe someday I'll write my own story about hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.t Trail.

0984999302|3.0|This book is a decent primer or reference for someone who is brand new to numerous business topics.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who has been through even a couple B school courses in college, however, as you will be disappointed.  The text on the pages is large, too.  So large in fact I felt as if I was reading a textbook for designed for a 5th grade class.  If you are looking for a very high-level introduction and aren't afraid of feeling like reading a kindergarten-looking book, then this is for you.  Otherwise, there are better options out there.
B001DTA8QS|4.0|It is a good value for money considering you get all Bach works played by Andrass Schiff. However, the sound quality of few (i.e. The Well Tempered Clavier) CDs are not the best. Still a good value for what you pay. As they said, \\"money doesn't lie\\" ;)

0385344228|1.0|Defending Jacob has an interesting premise, namely \\"What would you do if your teenage son was accused of murder?\\"  But the premise collapses into absurdity because of poor writing technique, repetition, lack of believability, and several outrageous factual errors (e.g. an assistant district attorney insists on questioning a suspect AFTER he has requested a lawyer; a shiva call is made to a family BEFORE the child is buried; a wife is married to a man for more than fourteen years and NEVER asks about his father, etc.)<br />In most novels there is at least one character you want to root for.  Defending Jacob has no likeable characters, particularly Jacob who makes Tony Soprano's son look like Mr. Congeniality.  The reader is left wondering why this kid was never in therapy.<br />Perhaps the biggest offense of the author, however, is using the first person point of view for the first 95% of the book and then \\"copping out\\" to an omniscient narrator point of view to reveal the twist at the end.  If the author had tried, he surely could have maintained consistency in the point of view to avoid a disappointing distraction in the final pages.  By the way, the \\"twist\\" was hardly worth the wait.  Despite the \\"hype,\\" Defending Jacob has no defense.
B004XKVPG6|4.0|Before watching a few other movies about vicious serial killers, I thought I'd seen the worst depiction of human cruelty in this film. Having said that, this film is very well done, but if you have a weak stomache, I don't recommend it. On the other hand, if you got through 8mm( by the same script writer-Andrew Kevin Walker) unscathed, you should be fine. Certain scenes, mostly the kill scenes, sent chills down my spine. It is a very good movie, and worth owning for the psychology behind it alone, but don't watch it after dark, that's a precaution. The story, though not original by today's standards, is chilling, to say the least, but the actors do an excellent job with their roles, Kevin Spacey as the killer does a great job being creepy, showing no remorse for his actions, thinking he was chosen by God...to kill, make sense? Didn't think so! Check it out, if you haven't already.

B0034G4ORC|5.0|I never cared for was movies, last one I saw was Platoon (that's how long) which was upsetting. Never saw Had no interest to see Black Hawk down & District 9 was weird. I lived on Camp Pedelton with my husband, retired marine. I did like the movie & of course there were things in it that weren't true. While watching this movie I could understand why these men get traumatized. They see their friends be killed & they do not have the time to grieve for them. I think the end can be taken different ways - they go back into battle to help fight or they don't know what to do now that they made it to camp.<br /><br />Michelle Rodrigues an excellent actress, first saw her in Resident Evil but I think her acting was better in this movie. Actually I think they all were good.
B007SGM084|5.0|This Trilogy has a lot to offer a reader.  It was not just about sex as most people think.  A great story was told beginning with the first to the very last book. I have been highly recommending this read to everyone I know.<br />I hope you choose to enjoy the Grey Trilogies.

0061544493|3.0|I was expecting something different. I have always like Victoria, probably admire is a better word. I come from farm country and the thought that a girl can look SO glamorous all the time is truly impressive. But given the title I assumed it was more about HOW she looks so polished everyday, or at least why. I suppose I was looking for motivation or inspiration and I didn't really get either. It's just her telling you all the different types of clothes (skinny jeans, boot cut jeans, straight leg jeans), and then her list of designer labels of where to get them, which personally I will a) never actually look up to buy them or b) I could have googled it if I wanted designer stuff that bad. I wanted an insight into her world of how, why and for what  she wears what she wears and fits it all in her day to day life, not the same old deffinitions of what a pencil skirt is and what an a-line skirt is, which anyone who has ever read a fashion magazine allready knows. I still admire Victoria. I just wish I got more from her book. Or at least learned something new.

B005GHN2GG|5.0|Masterful story telling at it's finest! Master of the Crows is a brilliantly written dark fantasy that grabbed my attention from the first page. Fantastic depth of characters, including secondary characters. I loved Silhara and Marise's romance and fighting the evil God, Corruption. She is described as plain, but her personality is anything but plain, great sarcastic side to both Silhara and Martise. I loved the dark world the author created and found the book really hard to put down.<br />Others have mentioned typos, I didn't see any, I guess I was too wrapped up in this amazing story.<br />This is a book that I will read again and again!<br />Highly recommended for dark fantasy/dark romance lovers.

Favourites songs of mine are Pennyroyal Tea, Very Ape, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle and Heart Shaped Box.
B002GHHHG0|5.0|Creepshow represents George A. Romero, Stephen King and Tom Savini at the height of their powers. Inspired by the old EC Horror comics, Romero and King endeavored to create a Horror anthology and in the end what they made was a masterpiece of not only Horror but also one of the few movies that actually feels like a comic book come to life. Romero uses colored lighting, scrims and graphics to panel the action expertly while creating an ambience and mood that pervades the entire film. I consider Creepshow to be his true magnum opus. Sure, Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead are more groundbreaking but Creepshow achieves a level of perfection unseen in most movies. Kings stories follow the EC adage of the bad guy getting his just desserts with a nice level of irony that resonates throughout the film. Savini's make-up effects were state of the art at the time and still hold up. I want to make special mention of John Harrison's score as it is one of the greatest I've ever heard and worthy of Bernard Herrmann, Jerry Goldsmith and Howard Shore.<br /><br />Can't say much more about this incredible movie except that it's the perfect Halloween Horror flick with a love for the genre that pours out of every frame like so much of the blood spilled on the screen.

1416955070|5.0|SO... Im SO glad I finally read this book! Everyone that's raving about it is SO right!<br /><br />Cassandra Clare is an amazing author who truly makes her worlds believable! So... I know some people say this story is a lot like other stories combined and maybe there are similarities... BUT there are similarities in EVERY book. AND- as I was reading it, I didn't feel like it was unoriginal. I thought it was actually awesome.<br /><br />The story starts with Clary being attacked by a demon, and then her mother going missing, and she is left with a group of Shadowhunters trying to explain what the world is really like. A shadowhunter is basically a human with angel magic that kills demons and bad Downworlders (like Fairies, vampires and werewolves)<br /><br />As you can tell, this book has everything in it. Its not a fairy book, or a vampire/werewolf book, or even a fallen angel/nephilim book. Its everything combined. And you might think that would make it confusing, but its not.

Romance between Jace and Clary, and even kind of Simon- her mundane (normal human) friend.<br /><br />I didn't really like the twist at the end... because I like happy endings. BUT it did make it interesting and I have the second book ready, so I can figure out where the story goes!<br />I like that there wasn't a HUGE cliffhanger, though not everything was finished, so there is absolutely a story that continues.<br /><br />The characters felt so real, though I will say they all felt and acted much older than 16 or 17 years old.<br /><br />Clary was strong and unwavering in her fight to save her mother. I would have liked to see some relationship between them, but since the mother was taken at the beginning of the novel, we didn't get a chance. Still you can understand a childs love for her mother.  She was smart and witty and at time I laughed out loud at hers and Jace's banter.<br /><br />Jace was an interesting character. You immediately felt for him, the young killer, who was raised by a sadistic and cruel man.

B008MM9630|5.0|I love it so much. you get to choose fir different animal trees decoration....etc. its so fun. down side hard with the spells if you don't have friends. hopefully they could fix that so everyone with friends or no friends can use spells
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use. Liked the memory totals in the margins and concise nature of each calculation. Very, very good.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|It would be hard to get me to say anything bad about this movie.  It's not for kids, that's for sure.  It's a mature, silly comedy (silly in the best ways).  There are several of my favorite actors in it, Jennifer Aniston, Paul Rudd, Alan Alda and they all do a great job!  Paul Rudd is hilarious and I was lmao at him in more than one scene-he plays the awkward, at times bumbling husband perfectly.  It's a funny movie and I recommend it and also recommend watching through the bloopers and outtakes as they're hilarious as well.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|This is a short, well-written analysis of free will.  I particularly like how the Harris contrasts his opinion with that of Dennett and other compatibilists.  He focuses a lot on the social consequences of not believing in free will (people tend to act less morally), and that's useful as well.
B002DMJL9E|1.0|The movie itself is as entertaining as it always was, but this is one of the worst Blu-ray transfers I've ever seen. No special features either. If you already own the DVD, you're good to go. Save your money or put it towards something else. Very disappointed.
B007IX383I|1.0|This is one of the most artificial, pompous, plastic musical releases I've listened to from any genre, a cd that I am sorry I ever heard.<br />Faux melodies, faux lyrics.
0307730697|5.0|This book is awesome. Eric Blehm did an excellent job telling the story of Adam Brown, a country boy who went from 'Rock Bottom' to one of the best operators at SEAL Team SIX.<br /><br />I've read several books regarding Navy SEALs including biographies (SEAL Team SIX by Howard Wasdin, American Sniper by Chris Kyle, Warrior Soul by Chuck Pfarrer and of course Lone Survivor and Service by Marcus Luttrell) but one thing you will find is that once you read those books there is a lot of the information covered that can be found online or by watching videos in youtube.<br /><br />This book is 100% authentic and you cannot find this information ANYWHERE...A Roller-coaster of emotions where not only you will learn about Adam Lee Brown but also about his support system, from his Amazing parents to his (hero) older brother and twin sister, to his supportive and amazing wife and kids.<br /><br />This is the story of not only an American Hero but also an amazing family who will forever deserve our gratitude.<br /><br />I definitely agree with the rest of Adam Brown's team mates when they said: \\"If anybody from this team deserves a book written about him, that's Adam Brown\\".<br /><br />Stop whatever you are doing and READ THIS BOOK!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I'm obsessed with this movie. The first time my siblings and I rented it on DVD, we ended up watching it 6 more times, laughing more and more as the story became less confusing and the jokes made more sense. So many epic one-liners. I like the combo DVD and Blu-ray for sharing with people in my dorm without just a DVD player while still being able to enjoy the HD quality with my parent's Blu-ray player and big screen TV. The only thing better is seeing the movie in iMax 3D.
0307592731|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The last book I enjoyed this much was \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\". You do not need to be a hiker or outdoors person to understand and feel the rebirth of soul that occurred for the author while hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. A worthwhile read.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I remember first seeing this movie in middle school back when it was on DVD. A friend showed it to me, and from then on, along with some help from the Kingdom Hearts games, I've been in love with Final Fantasy VII. I bought the original game, Crisis Core, and both Dissidia games. I've spent countless hours replaying and re-watching the epic fight scenes of Cloud, Sephiroth, Zack, Angeal, and Genesis. This Blu-ray version really makes the action look fluid and clear. The addition of dirt, blood, cracks, and scratches to the environment and characters in old and new scenes makes the fights much more awesome and realistic. The added scenes not only made the battles much more epic and stylish, but it also made the story clearer and created better transitions from scene to scene. The price is also unbeatable.

B0082SU98U|5.0|My granddaughter and I saw a play this summer, \\"Pollyanna the Musical,\\"  written by a woman in our local community and performed by school-age children.  My granddaughter fell in love with the characters and the wonderful performance.  I recalled seeing the Disney \\"Pollyanna\\" movie in the 60's and was curious about the original book, published in the 1920's, I believe.  It wasn't easy to find the book. I searched several libraries and found one that had an abridged, lower reading level version, obviously adapted for young readers.  But I wanted the original, so I ordered it for my Kindle.  I read the story aloud to both of my grandchildren and they loved it.  In places, the wording is a little difficult because it is definitely written in the language of the day - early 20th century -  but the story is beautiful.  The term  \\"Pollyanna\\"  has become quite familiar in our culture today, but it has a naive, ignorant and negative connotation.  Unfortunate, because it is really a story about attitude, and we're all about ATTITUDE in today's world!  It is a great way to communicate optimism to children and help them see the world in a more positive light, no matter what the circumstances.  Our next step is to watch the original Disney movie.  It runs for 2+ hours, and I read that Walt Disney insisted it not be cut short because all aspects of the story were important. I can't wait to compare the book and movie!
B004Y1USV2|4.0|So here we are with the latest YES album, \\"Fly From Here\\", an ambitious attempt at continuing on with the YES brand. Let's be frank here, and get a few facts on the table... For one thing, YES is known for it's revolving door of musicians, so moaning and groaning about who-is-playing-what in the band is nearly a moot point - take it for face value, as nearly all artists that have been or are currently in the YES family tree, are top notch talents, so check your own ego at the door before taking on the YES audio adventure. Another thing to consider is that Chris Squire is more or less the \\"head master\\" at the School of YES, and even though he generally downplays this accusation, he is for the most part, the main cog of the band that keeps the machine turning. Chris Squire = YES.<br /><br />With those things in mind, this album is much more digestible to the hungry ears of any YES fan. Does this sound like Fragile-era YES? No... Does this sound like 90125-era YES? No... Does this sound like the album Drama? Well...That is debatable. Granted, like Drama, you have Trevor Horn in the producers chair, Geoff Downs handling the keys/synths, Steve Howe on Guitar and Alan White on drums, and a young and fresh new singer by the name of David Benoit who sounds eerily similar to Trevor Horn himself, so there is no question that it often is conceived by fans that it runs parallel to YES's  overlooked and underrated 1980 release with the same components. In fact, Squire and Horn have gone on record saying that the song \\"Fly From Here\\" was an actual idea composed during the Drama writing sessions, but never found it's way to the album. However, in my opinion it is actually a different animal all together.  I liked Drama for what it's worth. It has been 22 years since Drama, and a lot has changed since then, so let's just get over it and move on to the present day.  Production values have taken technical leaps and bounds, the artists involved with Drama and this album have matured and taken many paths in their career, and by adding in some new blood into the mix (Benoit), you have a very different sounding YES album altogether. And in my humble opinion, even with all of these things in consideration, this is by far THE most creative and well written YES album since The Ladder.<br /><br />Most fans will make it a point to call Squire out on the mat about replacing Jon Anderson for this album, claiming it would have \\"sounded\\" better if Anderson was singing on it, or that it isn't truly a YES album without Anderson. I emphatically disagree with these remarks. Why? Simply put - read the first paragraph of this review for a refresher course. This album sounds more like a modern-day, re-visioned, re-booted YES than the last 4 or 5 albums that had Anderson in the vocal chair.<br /><br />Without going into a track-by-track breakdown, I can attest that this is a very strong YES album, one that should be given it's fair shake, and in my opinion, will certainly grow on any fan of the band within a few good spins and become a favorite. From the brilliant and melodic 5-part, 25 minute epic (something the band has not actually done since Keys to Ascension, which were not actual studio albums per say) of \\"Fly From Here\\"  to the more simple and hooky songs like \\"Into  the storm\\"  Or \\"Life on a Film Set\\", this album is definitive YES through and through.
044655667X|5.0|This was an excellent book, I can't believe some of the bad reviews I read and I disagree with all the bad reviews.  Connelly introduces a prosecuter who doesn't play by the rules and sees Haller and the prosecuter going back and forth the whole time trying to get advantages for their case.  Connelly also does a good job of building Hallers relationship with his exwife and daughter.  This book is excellent and I highly recommend this book, this is one of Connelly's best!!

B0020TS5LK|1.0|The movie is the incorrect aspect ratio and it's distracting.  Sadly that isn't the only video issue.  The picture quality if horrible almost as if the movie wasn't only cropped, but also stretched.  No special features.  The movie itself is awesome.  Great action and effects that mostly hold up to today's standards.  I recommend the movie itself, but be sure to buy the American version.  (It was available when I ordered.  I wish I had waited.)

0785156593|5.0|This volume collects Infinity Gauntlet #1-6 which is a pretty complete story on it's own.  Now, [[ASIN:0785166432 Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos]] does include the events that lead up to the Inifity Gauntlet, but flashbacks and other exposition cover the vital information from that collection as well as the backstories of most of the major players.<br /><br />The story is basically this.  A villian by the name of Thanos has aquired the Infinity Gauntlet which is powered by the Infinity Gems giving ultimate power essentially making him God.  He is in love with the female personification of Death and as his gift to her he kills half of the sentient life in the universe with the snap of his fingers.  On Earth, heros unite with cosmic gaurdians in a last futile stand against a mad god at the end of the Universe.  This story has everyone.  Adam Warlock, Thanos, Silver Sufer, Galactus, The Watcher, Wolverine, the Hulk, the Avengers, the X-Men, Dr. Strange, Quasar, Dr. Doom, Mephisto, and many more.<br /><br />Pretty much anyone who was anyone back in 1991 is in this.  The art is absolutely gorgeous and the story is beyond epic.  Space, time, and reality are bent, broken, and destroyed in a cosmic struggle to stop Thanos.  I can't recommend this enough.  Sequels to this story include [[ASIN:0785121056 Infinity War (Marvel Comics)]], [[ASIN:0785131272 Infinity Crusade - Volume 1 (v. 1)]], and [[ASIN:0785131280 Infinity Crusade - Volume 2 (v. 2)]].  All of which I've read and recommend.

B005I64U5C|3.0|The problem with comic book movies is they tend to have legions of fans who adore the source material and sadly you can't fit decades of history into one two hour film.  That can usually be forgiven but there are too many misteps in this movie.  First off, Ryan Reynolds is a funny guy and he spends most of the time moping and being scared.  Also, the chick from Gossip Girl has no place in a comic book movie.  Green Lantern's cosutme is needlessly CGI so you're almost always looking at something cartoony.  The villian is a big yellow cloud (cause the purple cloud in Rise of the Silver Surfer worked so well?) and his henchman is a bald guy with a weird shaped head and a horrible come over that has telekenesis.  Fans of the comics were of course hugely dissapointed.  Now, if you have no idea of Hal Jordon or the Guardians are, then you might actually enjoy this movie.  but I wouldn't buy it without having seen it first.  The 3D Blu-ray reflects the rushed post conversion job so it totally isn't worth the extra bucks.  Unless you can get the 3D edition super cheep, I'd stick with the 2D version which looks a little flat.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|I no longer have faith in Amazon customer reviews after reading the reviews from the people that actually claimed this crap to be good. I'm not one to normally call something crappy or garbage just because i don't like it. But you guys, this album is the LITERAL definition of crap. If you enjoy this album, then if I were you, I would take a second and re-asses my taste in music and ask myself, \\"how hipster am I really trying to be?\\" This is another classic case of daddy paying the big bucks to see his daughter happy; no matter how talentless she is. Believe you me, there's enough auto tune in this album to prove my point. This is a tasteless, uncreative approach to music. If you listen to it and still like it, you're jeans are too tight or you really don't know what good music is. Probably both.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This novel got me to re-think my position on capital punishment.  I have always held that if a jury sentences death then so be it.  A jury took the time to examine all the facts and the right verict was rendered in the interests of justice. David Baldacci in his typical edge of chair story telling method conveys how a wrong jury verdict can send an innocent man to death by the State of Texas.  Can this happen in non-fictional life?  Sure it can.  How sad.  Can their not be another punishment?  A sentenece to work behind bars until death without parole may be fairer.  My position on the death penalty has not changed, although I feel more uncomfortable about it.  When you read this novel you will many times examine your position about fairness of punishment.

B0018QCXH8|5.0|Daniel Plainview is a new messiah, bringing bread, education, and wealth. Daniel Plainview is a Satan, an accuser, a murderer, a liar, and a drinker of blood. Both Christ and Antichrist, Daniel Plainview, embodies America, our industrialism and our greed, our benevolence and our violence. One part Flannery O'Conner, one part Rene' Girard, passing Upton Sinclair through St. John's gospel, Paul Thomas Anderson orchestrates a film that captures the American zeitgeist, that recapitulates our founding, this time in Little Boston, and the tea party replayed with Texas tea.<br /><br />[There Will Be Spoilers]<br /><br />The movie begins underground with Daniel Plainview digging for silver. The claustrophobia of the mineshaft, the ominous soundtrack, and the accident that breaks Plainview's leg, hobbling him the rest of the movie, set the stage for the events that follow. We follow him as he becomes an oil man, becomes the father figure to an orphaned boy, he goes wildcatting and strikes it rich with in a town notable only for its self-proclaimed prophet of the third revelation, Eli Sunday. These two rising stars struggle against each other; Eli hocking the wares of the church, Plainview the wealth of oil, resulting in the promised climax of the title. Both baptism and oil are likened to the Blood of the Lamb, both wish to bring health to the town, both rely on their tongues to accomplish their ends.<br /><br />At its black heart, the movie is about envy. Some seem to think that Anderson's film is guilty of sprawling; a sin committed in grandiose style by \\"Magnolia\\", but a charge that misses \\"There Will Be Blood\\", for it depicts a very tight spiral of mimetic violence, particularly brother-brother conflict. The first set of brother's are Paul and Eli Sunday, whose father's name, Abel, indicates the archetype of fraternal conflict; it continues with Eli and Daniel (a brother through marriage and baptism) and later with Henry (posing as his brother) and Daniel. But conflict is not limited to brothers alone; it spills out into the public square as Daniel's competition with the local church for the time of his workers and his tussle in the market with Standard Oil. His son H.W. is pulled into it when he torches Henry's bed and later breaks with his father to form his own company. In the screenplay this conflict is made even more clear when Fletcher Hamilton, Daniel's chief assistant, complains about Henry's inclusion in the company despite his own involvement from the beginning (a scene trimmed, no doubt, because this drew the attention away from Daniel Plainview's mimetic cycle). Every scene revolves around bitter competition. I could march through the film scene by scene indicating how relentless this theme is, and could argue that it is every bit as economic as his previous film, Punch-drunk Love.<br /><br />Like Anderson's previous films the actors rise to their highest limits. Daniel Day-Lewis seizes us by the throat with his performance, but unlike many actors in out-sized roles today, he never overleaps his intensity into parody. His mania is brutally simple, menacing, and he is matched by Paul Dano's scene gnawing performance of Eli Sunday. The role of the corrupt preacher is difficult to play without falling into thin caricature, but he manages to convey an earnest man of faith in the grip of intense jealousies and lusts. The movie itself is a veritable highlight reel of classic cinema, the baptism scene, the fight between Eli and Plainview, the oil fire, even smaller scenes such as Daniel and baby H.W. on the train are intensely gripping.<br /><br />The significance of the film, however, goes beyond its technical merits. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a promise that hangs over the entire film, but a promise that does not end when the movie ends. It is extended beyond the film -there will be blood- today and beyond. The movie could very well be expanded globally and called There Will Be Wars. The beginnings of the oil industry is the true founding of America and P.T. Anderson, avoiding the terse pablum that most politically conscious films fall into, is calling out the scapegoating, the holy-rolling, the hucksters, and the shysters by running this ethos out to its logical demise.rue founding of America and P.T.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It't as easy or hard as you want it to be as you can choose your level.  You can play at your own pace or timed.  I know my grandkids will like this app (game) next time they are at our home and want to use my tablet to play games.
B004D38HOG|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. I remembered watching Ally McBeal growing up and while reading the book I had trouble placing the character I remembered from the show, to the adult with extreme body issues that I read about in the book. It was actually heartbreaking at times to read about her crazy struggles every day - how exhausting that must have been!<br /><br />So while I found the story fascinating, I agree with other reviewers with regard to the plot - so much time was spent on her anxieties and showing the worst days, yet very little time was spend on HOW she actually recovered.<br /><br />Definitely a book I would suggest that anyone read who struggled with their weight - it really highlights the importance of being healthy rather than striving for that Hollywood idea of 'perfection'. Good on Portia de Rossi for opening up and sharing her experience.

B004VD3YIM|1.0|This app started locking up my Kindle Fire so bad I had to do a hard reset, plug/unplug the power cable, then do another hard reset again just to get my Kindle to unlock and come back on. After contacting the developer multiple times, I realised he just didn't care. I have two other relatives who had the same problem, so I know it isn't just my Kindle. Actually, I have three Kindles, so that's a total of FIVE so far it won't work on. This app is a total loss, renders my Kindle unusable, and the developer is one of the worst I've dealt with on Amazon. He won't even respond to my requests for help anymore. I finally had to uninstall this app and bought \\"Ip cam viewer\\" (full) and found no problems so far with that one. Take my advice, if you have a Kindle Fire, stay away from this app. I do have to add this, the app does work well on my Nexus 7 tablet, but it does NOT WORK ON KINDLE FIRE DEVICES. If you have another kind of tablet, it is a hit or miss, try the free version first. Better yet, if you have IP cameras and want to be able to choose from a list of good monitoring apps that work, don't buy a Kindle in the first place. Buy something else that will allow purchases from the Google Playstore. There is a better selection and most likely your device will be compatible with this app. Good luck.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|Guy Pearce is Snow, a sassy, irreverent CIA agent who is on the outs after being wrongly accused of murder ... in the future! Just before he is sentenced to 30 years of suspended animation in an orbiting Maximum Security space prison, said prison is inexplicably taken over by one inmate who manages to get a hold of a single ankle holster gun. (Maximum security, indeed.) Trapped along with the engineers and other faceless staff of the prison is the American President's daughter. Now the only one crazy enough to try to infiltrate the prison and retrieve the first daughter (as well as -- hopefully -- evidence that will exonerate him) is mouthy Mr. Snow.<br /><br />The glowing reviews on this site and elsewhere tell readers not to think too hard about the plot. One reviewer who might accuse me of \\"artistic snootiness\\" writes, \\"There are some plot holes and a few maguffins that will leave you scratching your head and wondering why events happened and why characters acted the way they did, but who cares? Have some fun with this romp and let your hair down.\\" Ah ha! That's my problem. My hair is up. Also, I care if movies have plot holes and inconsistent characters. I guess I'm kooky that way.<br /><br />Nuts to that. That's like telling me to \\"just have fun\\" at a magic show when I can clearly see the rabbits trying to escape out of the magician's pants. If you're going to spend twenty million dollars to make a film, wouldn't you want it to be fun to watch AND make even just a small amount of sense? Unfortunately, this film is so teeming with lunacy that only those of you willing to register it on the lowest of brainwaves will have fun watching. I knew I was in trouble the moment the prison was taken over by a single inmate, who gets a single gun, and who manages to release all 499 of the other inmates merely by cracking a scientist's head against a glowing control panel. \\"Where are all the guards?\\" I wondered. Why does that one gun shoot through that one window, but no other gun in the rest of the movie is able to even crack a pane of glass? Why does this station have automatic weapons that track and destroy spacecraft with the touch of a single, large, glowing silver button, but its orbit requires constant human reconfiguration or it falls out of the sky within an hour? Well, it IS a governmental building, I guess.<br /><br />The only fun to be had is in Pearce's acting. His character is no different than any other Will Smith/Bruce Willis hybrid you've seen before, but at least the seasoned actor appears to be having fun with his role. That's better than can be said for the wooden, one-note performances you get from virtually every single other character, with the biggest transgressor being the President, who appears to have taken his acting lessons from cold toast. Everything else, from the story to the characters to the canned dialogue to the hyper-frenetic editing is just one clumsily executed cliche after another. Even cliches can be fun, but when they are delivered with this kind of halfhearted awkwardness, they are less fun than embarrassing and -- eventually -- annoying.<br /><br />And hey, don't listen to those people who tell you to \\"just have fun.\\" Perhaps they haven't heard of \\"Moff's Law.\\" I quote, \\"[W]hen you go out of your way to suggest that people should be thinking less -- that not using one's capacity for reason is an admirable position to take ... you are not saying anything particularly intelligent. And unless you live on a parallel version of Earth where too many people are thinking too deeply and critically about the world around them and what's going on in their own heads, you're not helping anything...\\" There are a lot of cheesy, enjoyable action films out there that aren't so ludicrously rife with poor writing, directing, and acting, and there's a big difference between \\"letting down your hair\\" and putting up with crap just because it's loud, fast, sparkly and on fire. Even those of you who are only lookingfor a rip-roaring, high-octane, one-liner fest can do a WHOLE lot better than this weak excuse for a film.for a rip-roaring, high-octane, one-liner fest can do a WHOLE lot better than this weak excuse for a film.

0425263908|3.0|Unfortunately I was disappointed with this novel. The language made me cringe - blasphemic and peppered with swear words.The characters were not overly complicated or messed up, as has been suggested. Infact, considering their ordeals and their demons they seem incredibly sane. I am glad such a difficult topic was approached with sensitivity and for that reason I think it is worth reading. It was undeniably glamorous and all of the relationships covered were interesting. Not least her relationship with her parents. If the language could have been improved, and if there could have been more sensuality and a deeper exploration of the characters relationship then I feel this book could have a place on my shelf. Fifty shades wins head over heels for me. I found it to be addictive - romantic, sizzling and educational. Sex becomes truly sophisticated because it touches upon something far deeper - true love. It also touches on self doubt and sexual anxiety and apprehension. Both books carry an element of simplicity which makes it a light read - ideal if you have a hectic life. Fifty shades was more comical and more descriptive. I would say EL James is the more talented of the two. But one thing is for sure women are loving erotica. All we need now is a truly brilliant love story with bedroom scenes that top these!

030758836X|4.0|This is my first experience with a Gillian Flynn novel, and I am impressed with her talent as an author.  She weaves a story that at first makes you loathe Nick and then makes you quickly change your mind.  I was a little disappointed with the ending, but at the same time I would not have liked a \\"happily ever after\\" ending.  I would have given this five stars if the ending was somehow different.  I will definitely buy another Gillian Flynn novel.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|When a virus epidemic strikes the world, the World Health Organization and government agencies scramble to find a cure quickly as the body count rises everyday, but as the outbreak reaches its' peak, the governments also find themselves having to deal with arising social and economic problems.<br /><br />Focusing on various characters, the film takes a realistic look at what might happen if there ever was a viral outbreak in the world and the various viewpoints gives the film a real human undertone running throughout; the worried father, the focused investigators, the scientists trying to find a cure, the independent blogger. It made the movie very believable and almost documentary-like. I mean with millions of people dying and society descending into anarchy, will there be people or corporations who look to profit from it? You betcha.<br /><br />Director Steven Soderbergh keeps the pace brisk, so it never feels lagging, and things get tenser as the days whither on, emotions begin to run high and people become on edge. It's not his best film, but it is enjoyable and engaging and worth a watch, the cast of big names, including the ones not mentioned on the cover, were all brilliant.<br /><br />The only special feature I watched was `Contagion: How a Virus Changes the World', it's a 2 minute advertisement from TakePart.com about how an outbreak can affect the world and how you can prepare for it. It's a serious web site that wants people to be aware and prepare in case a real epidemic breaks out, was entertaining to say the least.

B006O5YI7G|2.0|Production values are good.  I love even okay westerns.  Struggled to finish this one.  Rather slow, completely pointless, and the direction of some quite capable actors is either non-existent or awful.  Real shame.  Underlying it all is a terrible script.  I do wonder what the makers of the film though was worth making about this movie.  Don't waste your time.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I enjoyed this novel, like all of Jane Austen's, because they are full of an admirable lightness. The character has flaws that she takes a long time to realize, showing a very real situation that happens to all of us. We all become pretentious when we do something right and we tend to want to repeat feats without considering the particularities of each condition. We want to be observers without look each situation with attention and we want to be wise without learning to listen.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I suppose Moneyball is a \\"must read\\" for baseball fans.  I'm not one, though, and I enjoyed the book immensely.  It should be a must read for any sports fan who is interested in the business of professional sport.  I would also recommend it highly to anyone in any tradition-bound business, profession or other line of work.  The underlying theme about challenging conventional wisdom applies well beyond the world of professional sports.<br /><br />The Kindle version I purchased also features a very interesting epilogue in which the author discusses the negative reaction his book received from the baseball fraternity.  It's well worth the read.  Don't miss it.
0439023521|4.0|This review is only for the first book, The Hunger Games.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book, far more than I actually thought i would. The pacing was somewhat slow in the beginning, which I think can be typical because that's where the author sets up the background and story, and speeds up slightly towards the end. There are places where it drags a bit, but overall the pacing is decent.<br /><br />The character of Katniss is interesting to me--at times she seems to live in an emotional void, yet she is strongly effected by certain people or situations. I would never have used the word strong to describe her as many other people do, but I will say she's a survivor. She is a really complex character that was hard for me to grasp and figure out who she is exactly. I loved the character of Peeta because he just always seemed comfortable with who he is and strong because of it--his character seemed to be light and hope. For me Gale was a harder character to grasp, which is interesting considering that he really is a central figure in Katniss' life.<br /><br />The Hunger Games: the games are violent, but not as graphic as I thought they could have been. I'm not disappointed since it is a young adult novel. There were times when any sense of urgency is lost, which I kind of felt sad about because it is a \\"fight for your life\\" even she is in. Certain parts really moved me and made it hard to put the book down.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an easy book to read. Personally, I responded really well to the world Collins created and had a very hard time putting the book down. I also think it is a book I will read again in the future.

0439023513|2.0|Originally, I gave this book five stars. On reflection, I've downgraded it to two stars. (The first two I award four stars each.)<br /><br />Katniss is extremely passive in this book, from the first chapter on. The book begins with her sifting through the ashes of District 12, which has been fire-bombed by the Capitol. She isn't angry at President Snow for ordering this. In fact, she blames herself for the dead. Excuse me, but this isn't the principled if reluctant rebel of the first two books. She moves into District 13, the supposedly \\"destroyed\\" district from the first rebellion, whose people, instead of dying off, have retreated into a vast underground fort with many levels of caverns. But she can't escape her image as the Mockingjay, the symbol of rebllion in the first two books. President Alma Coin of District 13 (actually more a general than a president) puts her to work making \\"propos\\" (propaganda videos) to incite the population to rebel. Some of these involve going close to the front with the risk of combat injury. Three times, Katniss is injured, falls unconscious, and only finds out about how the battle ended second hand, from her hospital bed. In between \\"propos,\\" she spends much of her time moping around, hiding in broom closets at District 13, or recuperating from injuries and groggy from pain meds. This is not our strong female hero from the first two volumes. Minus a star for that.<br /><br />Panem is in a full-blown civil war now. District 13, supposedly exterminated with all its population 75 years earlier, has merely gone underground (literally) in a vast system of caverns. District 13 is now spearheading the rebellion although allied with grass-roots insurgent groups in the other districts. One of the guerrilla groups (from District 8) is led by a certain Commander Paylor. Paylor is a woman, by the way, but Suzanne Collins never bothers to tell us her first name. There is almost no characterization of Paylor, so when she becomes President at theend of the novel, it's hard to know how much her administration will improve on Snow.<br /><br />Mistrust is mutual and intense between Katniss and President Coin. Coin, by the way, is also a failure of characterization. I get that she's supposed to be every bit as unscrupulous as Snow, but she doesn't appear in the book often enough to achieve clarity as a character. The highly personal, Katniss-centered, first person point of view that worked so well in the first two volumes is a handicap in this book. We need to know more about Coin so we can be sure about her motives. In other words, part of the book needs to be told through Coin's point of view, even when Katniss is not present. This is also true of Paylor, Coin's rival for leadership of the rebellion.<br /><br />Late in the book, Katniss' sister Primrose mysteriously dies in combat (she's all of 14 years old), and President Snow (whom Katniss meets when he's imprisoned and awaiting execution) persuades Katniss that Coin is to blame. Katniss believes him but this involves trusting Snow, which is incredible considering what he did to her home town, and for other reasons. Minus a star for that, and the the other failures of characterization I've mentioned.<br /><br />I still think the flight and combat sequence through the sewers of the Capitol is one of the best action sequences I've read in a long time. Some of the other action sequences are good too, but they don't redeem the book.<br /><br />Eventually Katniss goes home to the rebuilt District 12, marries Peeta, and they have two children. However, the reestablishment of their relationship needs to be dramatized. It isn't. Collins does little more than assert they got back together. Worse still, Katniss calls her children \\"the boy\\" and \\"the girl.\\" It's disturbing to think she cares so little about her own children she can't even be bothered to tell us their names. Minus a star for the muddled relationship.<br /><br />This leaves the book with two stars. Suzanne Collins is a great writer. In fact, she is now an influence on my fiction, a model to emulate. But I don't want to write anything like Mockingjay. The book is a big disappointment, and should have been rewritten a couple more times.

B008GOAFBQ|5.0|Ahhh... the first album that I ever fell in love with!!! If you don't own KISS' Destroyer and you haven't been captivated by it's undeniable power for the better part of your life, you're probably not reading this review. Readers, the album that you know and love can never and will never be tarnished, diminished or insulted by subsequent remixes & remasters. An album as good as this one is will not be altered to the point at which it becomes unrecognizable. You already own the original, have spun it countless times & have loved every minute of it for many years. What you have with this newly remixed version is not an attempt at improving the record but an opportunity to hear the record in a new and different light. It's the same old Destroyer with a sonic makeover. The drums and bass are much more prominent here as are the backing vocals. The choir in Great Expectations can be heard with much more clarity. There are sounds & musical passages that were committed to tape that are only now seeing the light of day, the original guitar solo in Sweet Pain being one. Beth also has a bit of Peter's vocals thrown back in that were omitted from the original mix. Ken Kelly's original album cover art is also a very cool addition. Going through each and every detail regarding what has changed is unnecessary. You must hear it for yourself and be the judge. Some folks will say that more could have been done with this but I suspect that those same folks would complain that, had further tampering been done, the album had been butchered. This disc is not a butchery and I very much enjoyed listening to it from an alternate angle. The songs on Destroyer are timeless anthems that always soar in your heart when you hear them and can't help but sing along with them. KISS fans... the spirit of '76 is alive and well on this release and to the few of you who haven't snatched it up yet, I recommend that you do so!
0439023491|4.0|If there is one thing Collins doesn't need it is another review. The reputation of her work really supersedes the need for commentary. If I hadn't challenged myself to review every book I managed to complete this year I don't know that I would even bother. Okay, that's a lie. I would review it, but only to prove I am not a mindless drone who follows the erratic whims of popular opinion.<br /><br />At the risk of being stoned by legions of fans I give the second installment of The Hunger Games trilogy only four stars. The book has a lot of great insight and more than a few really awesome moments, but I don't think Suzanne Collins' Catching Fire could stand on its own merits. The plot is fragmented, split down the middle, and I don't think the two halves necessarily complement one another.<br /><br />In the first part of the book we are reunited with Katniss as she struggles to find herself in the aftermath of the Games. Unfortunately, her defiance has rippled through the Districts making her both the de facto symbol of the rebellion and a potentially dangerous enemy of the Capitol. I liked this idea. Life after the Games, the psychological trauma, Katniss' attempts to find a sense of normalcy in District 12, even President Snow's attempt to manipulate her public image worked for me. And then Collins switched gears.<br /><br />Quite suddenly Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch are swept up in Games once more, this time facing off against former victors in the 75th Quarter Quell. Again, I liked the idea. Katniss and Peeta attempting to patch together and really understand their relationship, the exploration of Haymitch's past, Cinna's open support of the rebellion, the various tributes, the rising threat of civil war and the Capitol's campaign against the girl on fire.<br /><br />Two great story lines, but the only thread running between them is the Capitol itself, an entity who can't seem to decide how to handle a situation that threatens to bring about its downfall. Are they trying to mold her into their poster child or destroy her completely and why can't they seem to dedicate themselves to a game plan? Pretty weak linkage if you ask me. As much as I appreciated the first plot line, I honestly feel Collins should have salvaged what she could, worked it into the latter plot line and scrapped the rest. As is, the book simply isn't as solidly plotted as its predecessor.<br /><br />Filler folks. Good filler, really good filler, but filler just the same. A means by which to take the audience from Point A to Point B. Don't get me wrong, I love Collins' writing. Her creativity and imagination don't have a lot of competition in the young adult bracket and though I think she misstepped with the basic construction of the piece, I still think few books in the genre can match the originality of Catching Fire.trying to mold her into their poster child or destroy her completely and why can't they seem to dedicate themselves to a game plan?

B008MEM24S|4.0|Basically a wheres my water rehash, but still lots of fun. Several newto pieces that add challenge, but the overall game is easier, I think. Def worth the buck I paid for it though
0439023513|5.0|Talk about a comeback. Collins had me a little worried after Catching Fire, but she came back swinging and proved she can hang with the big boys with Mockingjay. Dear God in Heaven, I sound like a freaking sports announcer. Maybe I need to pull a Claudius Templesmith and commission my own sky screen, well it's that or cut back on watching so much baseball.<br /><br />Katniss finally comes into her own in the final installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. We've seen her stand up for herself before but always it has been a matter of her own survival within the arena. Allied with the rebels, Katniss is no longer fighting for the morbid entertainment of the Capitol's citizens. Though very much a pawn, she begins to understand her real strength. To my mind, this is exactly what the trilogy needed. Collins used up her time in the minor leagues and needed to sink or swim on a larger scale. She managed it beautifully and crafted something truly special.<br /><br />On that note, I can't express how much I appreciate that Katniss' story isn't all sunshine and roses. She experiences emotional pain on various levels and suffers serious psychological damage from her participation in both the Games and the rebellion. Now I enjoy a fairy tale as much as the next person, but enough is enough. The fact is not every story has a happy ending complete with unicorns and rainbows. I don't derive any pleasure from the misery of Katniss' situation, but I admire authors like Collins who aren't afraid to broach these subjects with younger audiences.<br /><br />In my review of The Hunger Games I touched on my annoyance over the love triangle and at the conclusion of the series I find Collins is something of an exception. She avoided the drama of the Twilight triad but I don't feel she ever really developed Katniss' romantic attachment to either Gale or Peeta. Personal opinion of course, but Collins' failure to cultivate any real depth in either relationship caused me to question why she bothered with the plot device at all. Seems like a waste of perfectly good ink.<br /><br />I'm not about to knock off a star for a minor quibble over content. I'm a picky reader, not a petty one. Mockingjay is an intense story and a satisfying conclusion to an exciting trilogy.red with the plot device at all.

The use of the word \\"baby\\" over and over and over again...no one talks like that in the adult world do they?? Besides not being very well written and \\"vanilla\\" as the book would call it, it was a sweet story of love blossiming. Don't get this thinking you will be the bad girl at book club, it's not THAT dirty.
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|Many people that have posted a review here on Amazon don't like this album. Most seem to be fans of Metallica's early work. I don't know much about Metallica but I do know Reed's work. This album unfolds like a play or musical but the music is very powerful and unusual to me. A naive small town girl with eyes wide, hits the big city and is overwhelmed by everything. She is ultimately destroyed. Reed sings in her voice and the voice of other characters as well. This is something like Berlin but even darker and maybe sadder. Listeners that are familiar with Reed's music may really like this. I know I do.<br /><br />.

He was young, we all were when this was released. It still is one of my favorite all time albums. Reed is a very special artist. It really comes through on Berlin. A very sad, heartbreaking album. There are many great musicians on Berlin. It still sounds great after all these years.

It's an excellent history of money covering every aspects of it and it's relevance in the modern world. I just couldn't stop reading this book. It starts with the initial development of money and then goes on to the history of bond, stock, insurance, modern day algorithmic trading, US-Chinese economic development, and it's resemblance to Darwin's theory of evolution. What an amazing book to read. It's full of stories of how and why things happened in history. I bought the e-reader version, so I can't comment on the look and feel of the book. Content is amazing, full of lot of historic events that everyone MUST know living in this world where nothing is possible without money. Ascent of money is a must read for every human being dealing with money.

0670022411|2.0|I really liked the first 100-150 pages of this book.  Then I just got so bored that I started skimming until about page 300.  Then I started skipping full sections and realizing I wasn't missing out on much of anything plot related.  I have it for another 8 days from the library, so I plan on attempting to go back and read it more thoroughly, but as of now I struggled with it.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful, but the main character (Diana) just bored the crap out of me.  There's only so much I can read about her sitting in a library reading papers.  I find sitting around reading research papers to be pretty boring in general - and the only thing more boring than reading them is reading about someone reading them.  YAWN.<br /><br />We also get to read about every meal Diana eats, every cup of tea she drinks, every stroke of the oars when she rows on the river for exercise (every morning...).  It got to be overkill, majorly.<br /><br />The vampire Matthew was intriguing at the start, but I also soon became bored of him as well.  When I read the first yoga scene at Matthew's house, I nearly facepalmed.  Especially when Diana sees Matthew standing on his ear.  Seriously?<br /><br />I think this book would be better if she chopped 200 pages of fluff out and streamlined the plot.  The writing is beautiful, but it just became so tedious that I started to force myself to continue - which is always a bad sign.

Most notedly the share button - Can't easily share on social networks or via email, which we use a lot to send to friends. It could be smoother and a bit less SUPER touch sensitive, but it's definitely a good start. The share button would have given it 4 stars, smoothness would have made it 5.

B0012CJQY6|5.0|Unbelievable...I barely even know what to say about this show that can do it the sort of justice that it has earned.  To be honest, I came across this show by chance and never even remembered it being on during its tenure on FX.  I was basically getting tired of the movies that were On Demand, so I decided to hop on Amazon and see if I could find something that I might be able to get into.  I don't exactly remember how, but I ended up checking out this series and figured I would spend the 15 bucks on the first season.  Knowing what I do now, I would have spent a million!!  This show is just absolutely terrific.  After the first show of the first season I knew I found something unique as my jaw dropped to the floor.  The writing is just bar none and the acting is just so damn real that every time I watched an episode I was just sucked in and could not be bothered for that 47 minutes or so.  If you are into the kind of show that leaves you staring at the blank screen after the show is over in complete and utter shock and awe, then look no further because you have found what you have been looking for!

1469984202|5.0|These books are very well written and,!uncommonly, very well edited. They were a pleasure to read and the story line and character development were outstanding. I did find at the end of each chapter that I tended to be to be very depressed about where I was going; however, it is amazing how you continue on to the end. This is a very enjoyable read.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I loved this book at first.  One of those that you don't want to put down.  It is a clever story and well written.  THEN YOU REACH THE END.  Did Ms. Flynn have someone else write the ending?  I have read books with lousy endings - but this is the ONLY book that the end made me ANGRY.  What a waste of time and potential.  I agree with others it seems Ms. Flynn did not take the time to make a proper ending.  It is not a matter of not liking the way it ended - it is the fact that the last two chapters are lazy writing.  Seems the author was more concerned with her editor's deadline than taking the time to make a complete story.  She should have shoved this into a drawer and waited for some inspiration.<br /><br />My advice - skip it.  If you must read it - purchase it second hand so you don't feel cheated.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Excellent film.  Miss Potter's conversations with her drawings are charming...their expressions, while she is speaking to them...more charming still.  The actors are perfect and the story is clever, interesting and enjoyable.  Miss Potter's strength and belief in herself, during a time when her behavior would have been shocking to most people, was wonderful to watch.  Her involvement with her publisher was sweet and romantic.  The chaperone, who trails behind Miss Potter everywhere she goes, is a real treat.  Though she rarely speaks, the chaperone's face tells a story all of it's own.  Her future sister-in-law is a force unto herself...forward, honest beautiful and strong. The film is lush in every way...scenery, time period and costumes.  Miss Potter's creations continue to delight people today and this film is a celebration of her life,  talent and determination. Highly recommended.
B004P7CN5O|4.0|Two habitual criminal's go on a killing spree and try to escape to Mexico.  Along the way many innocent people are killed or kidnaped in order to help them reach their destination.  They are the two wild Gecko brothers.  Seth (George Clooney) is the brainy but violent leader of the two and Richard \\"Richy\\" (Quentin Tarantino) it the psychotic one who would kill you for anything.<br /><br />On the way to Mexico they kidnap a family lead by an ex-preacher who has lost his faith.  He is taking his children to Mexico in a RV travel home.  When they get to their destination which is a wild trucker bar they think they are safe but their problems have just begun.....<br /><br />This is a good movie but it is very violent and bloody.  It also contains a lot of foul language and nudity so if this is not your type of movie you should be warned.  The special effects are very good and when the bar staff change the movie gets pretty creepy.  If you like vampire movies and wild action movies then you should definitely see this one.<br /><br />Several sequels of this movie were made but this one is the best in my opinion.  It is a good horror movie and I recommend it to you.

159514188X|5.0|Review updated February 23rd, 2015.<br /><br />Have you ever read a book so powerful that you believe it can genuinely change lives? Thirteen Reasons Why is one of those books. Though there are plenty of authors who have written books that skirt around serious subject matters, there are few who have gone into detail and made their books count. Regardless of whether you, someone you know, or nobody in your life at all, have been in a similar situation as Hannah, I can guarantee this novel will hit home. Jay Asher is an amazing author with the ability to really get inside your head and make you care. Though you may not like this book for many different reasons, you will not walk away and say it didn't impact your life in some small way. It's impossible.<br /><br />Told in a truly unique way, this is the story of Hannah Baker - a normal high school student - and the reasons behind her suicide. Thirteen people that will have to live with the knowledge that they had something to do with Hannah's death for the rest of their lives. Thirteen people who had no idea how the smallest of things can impact someone else's life in such a huge way. We hear Hannah's story through cassette tapes, passed around the group of thirteen. Clay Jensen is on that list somewhere, and we listen with him as Hannah pours out her soul, feeling his emotions as if they're our own.<br /><br />The snowball effect is something that every single person has experienced at some point in their lives, so in that aspect, this novel is easy to relate to. However, there are only a certain amount of people out there who will truly feel this book. It's easy for a person to say that something depressed them, but I can guarantee that not a single one of those people has ever experienced real depression: the soul-wrenching feeling that keeps you awake night after night as you think about every little detail of your life and how all those experiences have woven together to get you to where you are today. Despite manifesting itself in a lot of different ways, there is one thing that links every single person with depression together: the thought of suicide.<br /><br />Though Hannah seemed wildly unconcerned by the thought taking her own life, it's easy to tell from the very beginning that this girl is deeply depressed. The humour she injects is tinged with sadness, and I felt myself drowning in her despair. I felt like Clay. I just wish she'd told someone exactly what was happening before it was too late. I found myself angry at her on several occasions, wishing she'd just taken the oppurtunities to speak up when she had the chance. And then I realized she and I aren't much different. Back in high school, when my depression started, I never sought out help. I hoped that someone would just know. That a single person would realise that something had gone seriously wrong in my life and just be there for me. But people aren't mind readers, and Hannah and I made the same mistake. After that realisation hit, I found myself more and more invested in her story, hoping and praying that someone would come to her rescue, despite already knowing the outcome.<br /><br />I can't say that I'm angry at Clay for not noticing the signs. After all, high school is an emotional time for everyone, and people spiral up and down throughout. It's not unusual for a girl to come in one day with drastically different hair. It's not unusual for a guy to take a break from being a pleasant young man to a delinquent juvenile desperate for attention. At the end of the day, nobody really knows what's going on inside someone else's head. Clay's emotions throughout the entire book felt so real, and I found myself laughing with him, mourning with him, and breaking down with him. We both wished that Hannah had just opened up to him. He could have changed everything if she'd let him.<br /><br />When I first started this book, I had trouble with the style. I couldn't wrap my head around the two different points of view running simultaneously. Occasionally Clay's thoughts would take a completely different turn and I'd have trouble keeping my own thoughts on track before we'd be back to Hannah again. It definitely took some getting used to, but once I got there, I absolutely loved what Asher did. It made the novel feel infinitely more real, and I'm so glad he decided to add Clay to the story, instead of keeping it all Hannah.<br /><br />There were multiple aspects of this novel that I loved, but I think one of the teachers' ideas to bring the class together was the best. Basically, each student has their own paper bag. If you have something nice you want to say to a person, but can't bring yourself to say it to their face (it's surprising how many people have difficulty), you can leave them a note in their bag, completely anonymously. It's an absolutely fantastic idea that may just brighten up someone's day. And you can even incorporate this into your own life. I mean, why not leave a colleague a note by the kettle? Or slip it into a fellow student's locker? At the end of the day, that little friendly note might just prove that there's someone out there who actually cares.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is an incredibly powerful novel that will change your life if you let it. It teaches us that even the smallest of actions can impact someone else's life in an extraordinary way. It's unpleasant thinking that you might be one of the reasons a person is on a major downward spiral, but there are so many self-involved people out there that this book could very well be a true story. Jay Asher is an incredible author, and I'll definitely be checking out his other works.

B00DWWG6T2|5.0|Review updated June 4th, 2015.<br /><br />I didn't think there was an author out there who could make me feel every emotion under the sun with just one sentence, but Richelle Mead managed it and blew my mind completely in the process. The last sentence of this novel broke me in a way that nothing else ever could, and while I can't go into detail because of obvious spoilers, know that this entire series thus far has been leading up to what is coming next. I knew things wouldn't be easy for Rose, but what Mead did was beyond unexpected. There was a much darker tone to this novel that what we've experienced thus far and it definitely added to the plot in a positive way. Following the events of this novel, however, it's clear that it's just going to get darker and more serious from here on out.<br /><br />But enough of that, it's time to start talking about the plot of this novel - the darkness that has started taking over Rose's mind. I think we've all been so worried about Lissa's mental health that none of us have thought about the effect the bond could have on Rose. I can't go into detail because spoilers, but I actually was quite worried about Rose throughout this entire book, and when she sees someone known to be dead, everything we thought we knew about the world Mead has created was changed in an instant. Following Mason's death and her first two Strigoi kills, Rose's mind becomes fragile and her moods unpredictable. There were hints towards what was happening but it took Adrian Ivashkov of all people to finally uncover one of the few remaining pieces of the puzzle.<br /><br />Speaking of Adrian, my gosh do I love him. He tries so hard to act as though nothing in the world phases him, but it's easy to see through the façade and glimpse the vulnerability behind the mask. The last conversation he had with Rose in this book nearly brought a tear to my eye. His genuine words and actions hadn't been witnessed before that moment, and I can't wait to see what comes next for the Ivashkov playboy. He's just such a fascinating character, and it's strange how much he connects with both Lissa and Rose though on very different levels. I imagine he and Lissa are going to be spending much more time together after graduation as they train with their spirit magic. As for Rose... well, who can ever really know what Rose is going to do?<br /><br />The romance in this novel hit a turning point and while I do think that Rose and Dimitri are made for each other, I did find myself hoping that she and Adrian would give it a shot. Though the whole Mason-Rose-Dimitri fiasco could have been classed as a love triangle, I was actually hoping that Adrian would take control of the situation and become a solid corner of the triangle. Yes, you read that right, I was actually hoping for a love triangle. I just think Mead has done a fantastic job with everything else she's created, and if anyone could make the dreaded love triangle work, it's her. I have no idea what's coming in the following novels, however, so we'll just have to see if a love triangle is remotely within the realms of possibility.<br /><br />As I said before, Mead has nailed every element of this series, so it was no surprise to me that she could write epic fight scenes. The magnitude of the battle at the end of this novel was much larger than anything that Mead has attempted thus far and I was completely enthralled by her writing. Definitely some of the best action I've ever read.<br /><br />Overall, Shadow Kiss is an absolutely fantastic turning point of this series. I have no idea what to expect from the next novel but I'm definitely excited to find out what happens.

1416914293|5.0|Review updated March 23rd, 2015.<br /><br />When it comes to character development, Cassandra Clare is a literary genius. She has absolutely no qualms about throwing giant hurdles in the way of her characters; happiness, and I found my heart breaking on multiple occasions. I didn't think it could get much worse than the feeling I had after we discovered that Clary and Jace are siblings, but I was wrong. The struggle that these characters have to deal with is soul destroying and I found myself completely invested in their story. I'm still holding out hope that Clare will somehow rectify this tragedy, but I guess I'll just have to dive into the third installment to see what she comes up with next.<br /><br />Clary has done a major one-eighty fom the naive &#34;mundane&#34; she was when we met her in City Of Bones, turning into a brave young woman who will do most anything for the people she loves, even if it means risking her own life. Unfortunately, I don't think Clary has a strong future as a Shadowhunter. She feels everything on a very personal level - something I, personally, can definitely relate to - she does let it cloud her judment more often than not. With a little training, she'd kick ass, that's for sure, but until she can keep her emotions in check, she won't survive long in the Shadowhunter world. Despite loving her relationship with Jace, and getting emotionally invested in their struggles, there's a tiny little part of me that is glad they can't be together. In a lot of ways, Clary is no good for Jace. She's too fragile, and there's a part of me that still thinks Jace would get bored - after all, he's not one to wear his emotions on his sleeve. After they visited the Seelie Queen, however, I started wondering whether that was true. The vulnerability we saw from Jace in this novel was unexpected and it made me question everything I thought I knew about him.<br /><br />A force to be reckoned with, Jace Morgenstern is a prime example of the fantastic cast of characters Cassandra Clare has created for this series. Witty, sharp, and a total badass, Jace had me falling head over heels for him in City Of Bones. This novel, however, brought out such a vulnerable side of him that I found myself wanting nothing more than too see him get his happy ending. From the lies his father told hm as a child, to finding out the girl he loves is his sister, Jace has not had an easy life. It's easy to see that he uses humor as a defense mechanism, but his walls definitely started crumbling in this book. Fingers crossed that he catches a break in the next book!<br /><br />Cassandra Clare has a very unique style when it comes to the mythology she incorporates into her stories, taking bits and pieces from most every myth and adding her own twists. Angels, demons, vampires, werewolves, warlocks, fairies... there's something in these books that will appeal to most every fantasy fan. Clare's writing flows beautifully and I found myself completely hooked from start to finish.<br /><br />Despite not liking Simon very much, I was gobsmacked and unbelievably happy that he had a bigger part in this novel. After his... experience, I started to understand a little more about him and realised that, while I still found him pretty annoying, he wasn't a bad character. I sense a lot of plot twists for this guy, the one at the end of this novel being the start of the snowball.<br /><br />I found the story itself to be extremely interesting and I love Valentine as a villain. His blood connection to the main characters means that there's a deeper level of feelings when it comes to hating him. It's pretty devastating (and brilliantly thought out) how these characters are connected, but I definitely hope Jace and Clary are Valentine's downfall.<br /><br />Overall, City Of Ashes is a fantastic second installment of this series, and I'm definitely going to get stuck into the third as soon as possible. I can't wait to see what happens next, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Cassandra Clare starts giving her characters an easier time of it. They definitely deserve it.ngers crossed that Cassandra Clare starts giving her characters an easier time of it. They definitely deserve it.

Lego has been putting out a new one of these series every year or so and they all bolt (snap?) together to let you build a nice cityscape.  Is it pricey? yes!  Is it detailed? yes!  Hey, it's Lego!
B00469MIOC|5.0|Review updated March 16th, 2015.<br /><br />First things first, I just want to say that I don't think I will ever get over how beautiful Cassandra Clare's writing is. The way her words flow together page after page is astounding, and her ability to draw you in with gorgeous settings and interesting characters is unmatched. From start to finish, I was completely ensnared within her world, and I can't wait to revisit it as soon as possible. When it comes to the plot, I was hooked. Clare has no qualms about throwing hurdles in the path of her characters, and the twists and turns had me dizzy - in a very good way.<br /><br />City Of Bones sees Clary Fray's life turned upside down in just one night. As if witnessing a murder wasn't bad enough, Clary finds herself at the mercy of the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to killing demons. They want to know how she could see them. When it comes to light that Clary's kidnapped mother was a Shadowhunter, Clary must decide: should she embrace her true heritage, or trust the Shadowhunters to bring her mother back to her? With the help of Jace, Simon, and the Lightwoods, Clary finds herself drawn deeper into the Shadowhunter world than she ever thought she'd go. Tolerating cocky teenage boys is one thing, but dealing with warlocks and werewolves? That's a whole other story. When it's discovered that Valentine, an enemy of the Clave, is alive and hunting for the Mortal Cup - the legendary item that will turn select mundanes into Shadowhunters - Clary knows that he has something to do with her mother's kidnap. But what she finds out about Jocelyn's past will not only terrify her, but completely upset her life once more.<br /><br />If there's one area that I believe this novel supersedes most other YA fiction, it's the characters. Despite Shadowhunters generally being much more mature and serious than their mundane counterparts, you can tell that these teenagers are, well, teenagers. So often in young adult novels do we find ourselves reading about characters that act so much older than they actually are, and while it doesn't bother me the majority of the time, it's nice to see a book that stays true to the audience it was meant for. Don't get me wrong, these teenagers are still pretty mature, but there are a large amount of (often very humorous) moments where their age truly shines through.<br /><br />Clary was a character that grew into herself throughout the course of this novel, and despite her naïvety at the beginning, I absolutely loved her. I thought she was a fantastic character that had the perfect balance of innocence and bravery to make her a truly formidable opponent in the future. Despite not liking Simon a whole lot, I did adore his relationship with Clary, and while I'm glad that she was completely oblivious to his feelings for a good chunk of this book, I smell something brewing. I don't want Clary to end up with Simon, but after the gut-wrenching twist pertaining Jace towards the end of this novel, I have a feeling that Clary and Simon will try and move things beyond friendship at some point. I'm not looking forward to it, and I genuinely hope it doesn't last.<br /><br />And then there's Jace. Despite his snarky comments and sarcastic humour, there's a side to this character that we haven't seen yet, of that I'm sure. His vulnerability is present from the beginning, though he hides behind a thick veil of cocky attitude. It's easy to see when he's talking about his father that he's still mourning his loss, pushing people away because he can't deal with anybody else leaving him. It's clear that Clary changed him in a way that nobody else has been able to, and I think that makes Cassandra Clare's unbelievable plot twist pertaining this duo even more of a heartbreaker.<br /><br />When it comes to the romance, Clare did a fantastic job at keeping it mellow and realistic. Clary and Jace didn't jump into a relationship, but there was a definite connection present from the beginning.Though Clary was determined to dislike him (and did a pretty good job of it, too), it wasn't long before cracks started to show through. She sensed that he was hiding a different side to him, and she drew it out of him over the course of the book. It was slow. It was realistic. An insane amount of flirting, a few passionate kisses and some intense conversational moments made up the romance in this novel and I loved it. It was such a nice change of pace from most other YA fiction.<br /><br />The story itself is interesting, but you can tell that there is much more to come. This was definitely a setup novel, and I can't wait to see where Clare takes us next. Valentine's reappearance is going to cause problems for Shadowhunters and Downworlders alike, and I know things are going to get intense. I'm glad that the author incorporated some history of the Circle, and I feel like these novels will be more enjoyable with an arsenal of knowledge behind us. It's always easier to enjoy a story if you know a bit of the history, after all.<br /><br />Overall, this was an absolutely astounding first book, and I'm so excited to carry on with this series. Cassandra Clare is a fantastic author that has the ability to keep you hooked in her world from cover to cover. With plenty of action and more than enough humour, this is an easy read that flows beautifully from the very beginning. Starting out with a bang, this book never slows down and I found myself completely ensnared.Though Clary was determined to dislike him (and did a pretty good job of it, too), it wasn't long before cracks started to show through.

1416914307|5.0|Review updated March 20th, 2015.<br /><br />Clary and Jace have been through hell since this series started, but the conclusion to this novel brought peace to my mind. I went into this book knowing that it was originally planned to be the end of this series, so with this knowledge behind me, I went in prepared - and excited - to finally get some long overdue answers. Cassandra Clare managed to make everything feel worth it in the end - all the heartbreak and suffering, all the tears and laughter. Everything came together nicely and I'm excited to see what she comes up with next. I know it's going to be a bumpy ride, but I'm ready.<br /><br />Clary's ability to give normal runes destructive power is something that's intrigued me ever since she blew up Valentine's boat. I always figured there was something special about her, but I couldn't have even begun to imagine what that something was. With the return of Jocelyn, we finally hear her side of the story, and the truth is even more brutal than I was expecting. What Valentine did to his children... I don't know of a single author that could have come up with that twist. Clare is a genius and I can't wait to discover what other twists she brings to the table.<br /><br />With the introduction of Sebastian, I braced myself. Here it is, I thought, here's the dreaded love triangle. Despite the whole Simon, Clary, Jace fiasco, there has never been a serious love triangle in this series thus far. Fortunately, my fears were quelled pretty quickly. Sebastian was, for lack of a more eloquent word, creepy. He definitely had an ulterior motive, and I wasn't surprised in the least when this proved to be true. Though I couldn't figure out his endgame, or his reasoning, I had faith that Clare would come up with a spectacular plot twist. And boy, was it a doozy. I could have never imagined that ending, and I'm fully expecting to get more answers in the following books.<br /><br />My feelings towards a couple of other characters have done a complete one-eighty since their introduction in City Of Bones. Isabelle is no longer an immature brat, and Alec has finally stopped whining. Both are fast becoming loved characters and I can't wait to see what happens in their storylines next. Simon, however, is definitely the character that has come the farthest. Despite still being a little awkward and geeky, vampirism suits him. He's a little less sensitive and really stepped up to the plate. His ability to walk in the sunlight finally got an explanation in this novel, and it brought various parts of the plot together wonderfully. Clare has absolutely outdone herself with Simon's development, and I can't wait to see where she takes him next.<br /><br />Valentine as a villain still felt right to me throughout this book. It's clear that he has no limits, though he's definitely not evil. I genuinely believe that he loves his son in his own way, and he honestly thinks that what he's doing is the right thing. Summoning Raziel is no easy feat, however, and finding the final Mortal Instrument - the mirror - is giving him pause. Of course, Valentine will never be stymied for long, and when he discovers the location of the final piece of the puzzle, it's a race against time for everyone involved.<br /><br />Tense, fast-paced, and filled to the brim with action, Cassandra Clare has created a world that you will fall in love with.

But most fans seem to love it. And I can see why.<br /><br />The title track is twenty-three minutes of musical astonishment, the segue from one section into another is truly remarkable. Father's Shout introduces the main theme as well as a cello and slide guitar solo. Breast Milky consists of an eerie chorus section accompanied by the late, great Richard Wright's keyboards, creating (to me) the image of a derelict church. Mother Fore gets a bit more bluesy, introducing Gilmour's soulful blues guitar solo before the choir is introduced again. Then the brass band kicks in once again and leads us to Funky Dung, a load of dissonant sound effects. Mind Your Throats Please consists of more sound effects as well as the build up of the brass band once again. Finally, Remergence is the coda of the suite, a reprise of the cello solo, and the choir and brass band providing a dramatic and awesome end to a wonderful piece of art.<br /><br />If is Roger Waters' heart-warming acoustic ballad; Summer '68 is a joyful little gem from Richard Wright; Fat Old Sun is David Gilmour's praise to the English countryside, a truly emotional number with such a dramatic and emotional guitar solo.<br /><br />Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is a tongue-in-cheek piece of music which consits of wonderful, relaxing music along with the sound of a Pink Floyd roadie deciding what to have for his breakfast and then eating it! It almost makes you feel hungry yourself!<br /><br />I have never been so proud than to have Atom Heart Mother in my record collection. I hold it in higher regard than any other CD I own, including those of artists such as Led Zeppelin, The Beatles, The Doors and many more. That's right, even though I do love ALL Pink Floyd albums, I just can't express with words how much I love their cow album.<br /><br />Yes...<br /><br />I even love it more than The Dark Side Of The Moon.<br /><br />I even love it more than Wish You Were Here.<br /><br />I even love it more than The Wall.<br /><br />I have not in all my life heard such a fantastic and well-orchestrated (no pun intended) album. If you're feeling low, this will see you through hard times, no end. If you fancy a trip away from Earth for a while, this album will take you there and back, safely. Atom Heart Mother remains, in my eyes, the ultimate crystal in the history of music.

B0048WQDIE|4.0|Having read the paper version of Catch-22 several times, it's one of my favorite books... I was surprised how few scanning errors there were when compared with some of the other masterpiece books I've ordered for my Kindle. Especially the older, out of copyright classics, where I found many errors. I am very happy with my e-book version of Catch-22.
030758836X|4.0|Even if you don't usuallly read mystery or thriller type genre novels, you'll enjoy Gone Girl.  It's a page-turner, but also a very smart, well-written novel.  You could read it just for the plot, but it's also a biting social critique of our national obsession with crime-related news.  The author also explores some very real dynamics in relationships by taking them to their most terrifying extreme.  Who hasn't pretended to be his or her best self at the beginning of a relationship?  And what happens when you finally get to know who the other person really is?  How much do we have to overlook in our spouse or how much do we change ourselves in any marriage? It certainly rasises some questions about society's ideals regarding romance and marriage in contrast to the imperfect reality.  It will leave you shaken and unsettled, which is why I think some have been critical of the ending, but it will leave you thinking.

B004UHF51S|4.0|When I was in high school, I used to be a metalhead.  I saw every possible rock band you can think of, and to some degree, I still like some of those \\"hair\\" bands to this day.  Ozzy Osbourne with Randy Rhoads albums (CDs?  MP3s?  What are you supposed to call them nowadays?) are some of the finest ever made of that genre for sure.<br /><br />But as I got older and (hopefully) wiser I started listening to jazz more often, mostly because my wife gets a headache while listening to AC/DC.  Can't blame her.  But she was a fan of Michael Franks, and I quickly became a fan of his as well.  He has a really nice style, hardly ever overbearing and always entertaining.  Stay with me on this one, and yes, I know it's a bit of a stretch.  But I find parallels between Mr. Franks and Neil Peart from Rush.  \\"What?\\" you are saying in disbelief.  But Mr. Franks writes excellent, poetic lyrics that you could put in a book and just read and be satisfied.  Mr. Peart does the same, or at least he used to when he wrote lyrics for songs such as \\"The Trees.\\"  I'm not so sure about some of Rush's later albums though.<br /><br />We saw Mr. Franks in Oakland during the summer of 2012, and he did not disappoint, once again.  He was promoting this album and the songs that he played fit perfectly with summer, of course, as that seems to be the theme of this CD.  Now, this record is surely not his finest.  I like \\"Blue Pacific\\" maybe the most, as it's very approachable and gives you the feeling of hanging out on a warm beach just by listening.  And maybe this record doesn't really deserve a 4, maybe a 3.5, but I will round up since I'm a fan.<br /><br />Mr. Franks is getting up in the years and he's been putting out records for a long time.  Here's hoping from me that he doesn't call it quits anytime soon.

0345803485|1.0|I tried to read it, I really did. I got about 250 pages in and I was done. I've read a lot of books in my life and no, I didn't like all of them, some I even hated, but one thing I couldn't say: they were poorly written. That is, until I came across this book.<br /><br />My main issues with book: poor writing, boring characters, awkward and boring plot.<br /><br />The female lead, Anastasia, is such a boring and unlikable character who is way to weak and naive as a person. Not to mention that she's in her early 20's and apparently has the sexual knowledge of a 12 year old virgin. I found Christian, the male lead, to be somewhat interesting. Other than the fact that he's a total freak, there seems to be some big, underlying cause behind it. I read as far as I did in hopes of learning more about him, but since the whole story is told from Anastasia's point of view and is just so slow, I couldn't bring myself to do it.<br /><br />Anyone who can read this and not be torn about from the inside because of the poor, repetitive writing style (if you could even call it a 'style'), is someone who does not read books. Any avid reader would just be appalled at the act that this was even published. The whole story is based off of Twilight fanfiction, and Christian and Anastasia are simply a non-vampire version of Edward and Bella. I read fanfiction online pretty often (though it isn't Twilight fanfiction, it's all the same anyway)and this is no different from what I've read a thousand times, online, for free, with the other difference being the characters' names. The reason why fanfiction isn't my main reading material is because I can't get through more than one chapter of it. 50 Shades of Grey is no different.<br /><br />Perhaps this book is popular because of the sex? Are you kidding me? I've read plenty of smut novels and fanfiction and this is really nothing 'taboo'. Maybe if it was real it would seem bad, but it's a fictional story. Have people never heard of BDSM before?Plus, the way it's presented in this book is just...no. It never fails to amuse me how people twice my age are just so appalled at the whole BDSM concept in a book. Get over it.<br /><br />And I've heard this is going to become a movie. Oh my god...<br />All I have to say is that this E.L. James must have had some darn good connections if she managed to get this garbage published.

1476712042|4.0|The love story that unfolds takes place at a small Eastern University. It is here that we meet Abby Abernathy. She is dressed like Sandra Dee before she meets Danny Zuko in the movie Grease. She looks like a good girl; she doesn't curse, drink and has a plan to escape her dark past. Her well laid plans are challenged when she meets the campus king of one night stands, Travis Maddox. He is a student by day and a fighter by night. Abby is drawn to this sexy, charismatic, intelligent, tattooed love machine. She is drawn to him like a moth to a flame even though she recognizes the danger.<br /><br />The characters in McGuire's world beautifully depict both the dysfunctional and those who enable them.  Abby grew up in a dysfunctional family, where her parents put their own needs first. She lived in a home where she often played the parent. I liked Abby and all of her complexities. She appears so well adjusted on the outside, when really she lacks confidence, has low-self esteem, wonders if she is loveable and wants to be needed. I admired her attempts to forge a different life for herself. Travis Maddox is a character you will either love or hate. He has true attachment issues, is quick to temper and has difficulty expressing emotions. He is charismatic, and despite his tattoos and bad boy looks he is cute, smart and witty. Woman are drawn to him, they want to fix him; to be the one. Travis is traveling without a compass until he finds Abby. Travis's cousin enables, protects and coddles Travis's volatile personality. America, Abby's best friend adds to the drama and is perhaps as messed up as Abby. Kara is Abby's roommate and the only normal person in the book; she recognizes that the relationship is unhealthy. Parker represents the life Abby thinks she wants.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster gives us a rare look at a dysfunctional relationship. Abby and Travis's relationship is like a hurricane. It is beautiful, scary, deadly and uncontrollable. McGuire's tale shows how two needy people are drawn to each other and how they feed off each other. A lot of people will struggle to understand why Abby is attracted to Travis or vice versa. The truth is each has what the other needs emotionally. We are all drawn to the bad boy; even the fictional characters we adore are often rogues in need of fixing. Most of us get a little too close to the flame, recognize the danger and flitter away. This book depicts the startling and harsh truth behind these relationships. The novel also shows some of the dark underbellies that exist on campus. The tale had a nice flow, with plenty of climatic scenes. I was disappointed the author didn't incorporate a message about seeking help, or at the very least a one eight hundred number in the back of the book. She had the perfect opportunity with the voice of Kara and failed miserably. I firmly believe this does not belong in the YA genre and should be shelved under New Adult. My emotions where all over the place while reading this and my feelings for the characters changed with each scene. This is a love story that you will think about and talk about. I love when an author is able to breathe life into the characters as she draws emotions from the reader.<br /><br />I want to thank Atria Books and netGalley for providing this ARC in exchange for my unbiased review.o needy people are drawn to each other and how they feed off each other.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|Ehow: How can I turn a great read into a general appeal movie without integrity or appeal?<br /><br />This is surely what the screenplay writers and Disney typed into google when they sought to turn New York Times bestseller, The Help, into a movie. I feel for Stockett, although she is surely happy to see her 1st novel do so well and to have sold it for the big screen. It must, however, have been a bittersweet day when she saw her baby at the premier. The book itself was a page  turner, well written, realistic and thrilling. I loved it! The movie lost all of that intensity, with the overall message of the film straying so far from what Stockett had portrayed. I can't imagine how she must have felt afterwards. I think I would have been ill once I got home. There is a review by The Cool Guy here at Amazon, in which he detailed illogical scenes and messages of the movie, I will not include these here as his review does this well. I hope he reads the book, these problems are not present there. I also feel for the actors of this film. What an amazing offer to have a role in what could have been a film to remember.  They did what they could with what was written, however, the screenplay writers and directors really took a wonderful opportunity away from them with their decision to write the movie as they did. I look forward to seeing them in films that deserve the name. As a movie, it was cute, distracting - not a 1 star but not a 5 star either. My question, were the producers, directors and editors rushed by some selling force as was portrayed by Elaine Stein when she urged Skeeter to hurry up and send her manuscript, \\"before this whole civil rights thing blows over.\\"?

1476712042|5.0|Jamie McGuire is officially my new favorite author! Beautiful Disaster was an amazing book. I have never read a book that captures so much of the crazy whirlwind that is love. Once I started reading it I could not put it down, I then passed it to my sister and she was the same way. It was so much like real life with real characters that I caught myself going through so many emotions with them throughout the book. Just absolutely brilliant. This is a must read, I can't wait to read more of Jamie's books!
030758836X|3.0|I started recommending this book to everyone about 2/3's through, and swiftly retracted the recommendation after I finished it. I don't need everything tied up in a bow, but SOME sense of an ending. Heh.
B00846REIS|1.0|I started this after numerous people recommended it after 50 Shades.  It was a HUGE disappointment.  How did she even get away with writing a story SO SIMILAR!! I felt like I was reading about Christian and Ana in different costumes.  Only \\"Ana\\"/Eva is also privileged in this story.  I wanted a new story line, otherwise I could have re-read 50 Shades.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was never a huge sci-fi fan, but started reading Ender's Game.. And to this day it is still one of the best books I have ever read. Orson Scott Card does a wonderful job at giving the characters depth and the plot is awesome as well!

0425263908|4.0|I received this book courtesy of Penguin and yes, I read it after I read FIFTY SHADES OF GREY.  I was skeptical because I wasn't really excited about FIFTY SHADES OF GREY and didn't think it deserved all the hype it was getting.  I will have to agree with many other reviewers that BARED TO YOU started out very similar to FIFTY SHADES GREY.  But, I do think that is where the similarities end.  In the beginning, I was frustrated and felt like I was reading the same story, but as I continued on, I became much more involved in Gideon and Eva's relationship and their stories.  I was continually frustrated with Eva's immature running away tactics and found parts to be unrealistic, but this isn't a realistic type of novel.  This isn't the typical relationship found in your neighborhood, but one that is set in NYC, with a billionaire for a boyfriend and two people with devastating pasts that interfere with moving them forward.<br /><br />Women (and men too) read these type of novels for an escape.  We crave the romance and seduction and if the characters are likable and the story line isn't too predictable, then the author and the reader have succeeded.  This was that kind of novel for me.  Yes, the sex was unrealistic and overtly descriptive, but still, I was wrapped up in the story.  It also wasn't the type of sex that intimidated anyone or was violent, which I appreciated.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon have a mutual respect and love for each other and both have devastating histories that would mess up anyone's life.  Together, they find ways to cope and learn from each other which is normal....the limos, gifts, apartments, and parties aren't normal, but play into the reader's fantasies.<br /><br />The drama of Eva's roommate and best friend Cary is also an added benefit to the story.  Day's descriptions of the characters and the situations are very clear and each of them are likable and you easily root for them.  Aside from Gideon and Eva's relationship, I am also just as interested in learning more about Cary and what is ahead for him in the next novel.<br /><br />If you have joined in on the craze of these types of romance novels, then BARED TO YOU is not one to miss.  It's sequel REFLECTED IN YOU comes out October 2, 2012, and I am planning to get a copy! (Incidentally I haven't read the rest of the FIFTY SHADES OF GREY series.)  Day's writing embodies both the physical aspect as well as the emotional part of relationships which makes it all the more captivating.terested in learning more about Cary and what is ahead for him in the next novel.<br /><br />If you have joined in on the craze of these types of romance novels, then BARED TO YOU is not one to miss.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|With Clockwork Angels, I feel like my Rush has come back to me.  I am an old guy and a long-time Rush fan, way back when the vast majority did not know Rush.  This is not a thorough review of Clockwork Angels, but bear with me.  Just giving a different perspective.<br /><br />2112 was my first in high school, and listened over and over.  Then Caress of Steel over and over in first semester of college in 1981.  Would let the album play overnight while I slept.  Then picked up Fly by Night which is nice and raw, and the title track Fly by Night stuck in my mind.  A Farewell to Kings was dam good, and remember liking Closer to Heart before the live version became a \\"hit\\" later.<br /><br />And then Hemispheres became my favorite of the Rush albums.  Still is.  And then the awesome songs The Spirit of Radio and Free Will off of Permanent Waves.<br /><br />And then Moving Pictures.  I could not believe it.  An incredible album \\"late\\" in their career.  I enjoyed each and every song. While maybe cliche, Limelight is still likely my fav Rush song, but others on Moving Pictures are so good too. (But never forget each and every word, and note, off of the first side of the 2112 album, the album that got me hooked on Rush.)<br /><br />And Signals wasn't bad.  I liked it.  But after that, Rush started to lose me.  Likely more me and my close-mindedness than Rush.  Indeed, I have recently been re-listening to some 80s and 90s Rush.<br /><br />With Clockwork Angels, I miss Geddy's high-end hits on the voice from the early years, but I do definitely recognize Rush again.  They have come home.<br /><br />My ranking (opinion only) of their studio albums starting with their best:<br /><br />1.  Hemispheres (1978)<br />2.  2112 (1976)<br />3.  Moving Pictures (1981)<br />4.  Caress of Steel (1975)<br />5.  Clockwork Angels (2012)<br />6.  Permanent Waves (1980)<br />7.  A Farewell to Kings (1977)<br />8.  Fly by Night (1975)<br />9.  Signals (1982)<br />10. Rush (1974)<br />11. Counterparts (1993)<br />12. Grace Under Pressure (1984)<br />13. Presto (1989)<br />14. Power Windows (1985)<br />15. Snakes & Arrows (2007)<br />16. Roll the Bones (1991)<br />17. Vapor Trails (2002)<br />18. Test for Echo (1996)<br />19. Hold Your Fire (1987)

0345535421|4.0|A Clash of Kings, the second novel in a Song of Ice and Fire, picks up where Game of Thrones left off with the Starks spread throughout the land, each fighting their own battles and facing hardships previously unknown to them when they were all together at Winterfell.  All the other major plot points are continued here as well; Jon Snow as part of the Night Watch, Daenerys Targaryen fighting for survival in a strange land after the death of Khal Drogo, and many players in the South competing for a crown and loyalties.<br /><br />The plots thicken in this novel as we become more fully immersed in the series and get to know the characters better.  The unfortunate side of that is that there are so many different plots and different characters, it's hard to keep them all straight, especially if you've taken a break since reading A Game of Thrones.  The novel is still entertaining though, with tense battle scenes and clues to the unfolding of the various schemes.  There is more magic and sorcery in this one, which I liked.  Highly recommmended to anyone who loved the first in the series, but make sure to begin with that one; these are not stand alone books.

I travel on business and since they got me season 1 and 2, I have been working in the hotel and jobsites extra so I can spend my flight time watching my Fringe DVD or electronic copies of it. What an intricate, and well thought out plot line with the never ending Massive Dynamic thread running throughout supporting the \\"Pattern\\". Phillip Broyles and the bad boy genious son, are perfect adjunct characters to our mad scientist. Olivia and the lightweight side story of her sister are totally complimentary. Olivia manages to be just a bit the new 2010 rage \\"Superior Women/Dumb Men\\" character, but the guys in the story are balanced and just when you think, \\"here we go again with superior woman thing\\", the story morphs and gets real again. I cannot recommend this series enough and it is on par with my love of 24 from years past. Go get it, but by ALL MEANS start at the Season 1 DVD. Otherwise you will have cheated yourself from the intricacy of the story line.
0062060562|5.0|Not really the typical book I read. Encouraged by my wife to read. i am so glad I did. Scary to be the main character and wake up every day with absolutely no idea of where I am or even who I am. The end is near unpredictable. There are a few moments when it became tedious, hang in there
1476712042|5.0|[[ASIN:1476712042 Beautiful Disaster: A Novel]]<br />I am normally a freak for paranormal books and also JD Robb but this book is really good the story of Abby and Travis is such cute story that once you get past the 1st chapter you are not going to be able to put this books down until you get to the end. Received the book in the mail and could not put it down I was loving the characters so much i got all way to 269 and only reason it put it down was because i had to be at work in the morning but I am so reading it on breaks and lunches. This is a book to read in front of a fire cuddles in blankets with some hot chococate!!

B0027V6AL8|4.0|There have been a few movies criticizing or commenting on reality TV shows such as the recent The Hunger Games or the interesting Jim Carrey film, The Truman Show.<br /><br />Originally written as a Stephen King novel, this film could be considered the granddaddy of reality TV movies.<br /><br />The Justice Department has an Entertainment Division where they send hardened criminals to participate in the Running Man TV series, hosted by Killian (Richard Dawson, an actual TV host at the time of filming).  They send dissidents to participate and they often end up killed by Stalkers while the audiences cheer on and make bets on the outcome.<br /><br />This dystopian view is quite amazing.  The special effects are however reminiscent of Logan's Run in their cheesiness.  Still, Arnold getting himself trapped and yet winning against the stalkers, the evil undercurrent that the show gives us, under the watchful eye of Dawson's character, and finally the struggle for freedom against an oppressive government (a bit heavy handedly) makes for some interesting yet thought-provoking moments.<br /><br />The DVD I had also includes the reality of governments taking over and usurping freedoms, specifically an attack on the Patriot's Act right after 9/11.  This piece is quite one-sided and if you're not a believer on conspiracy theories, you can skip this one.<br /><br />Part of the two-part DVD is a short on the reality show and how it's \\"here to stay\\" at least circa 1990s, with interviews by former Survivor stars and how the director of Running Man relates his film to present time reality TV.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  It's a fun film to watch!  However the political and opinionated features may be off-putting.  Modern reality TV as of 2012 is less pervasive from what I've seen.  Not sure if we're headed towards a Roman Gladiator/Coliseum-type reality soon such as the Running Man, but who knows?  Recommended.<br /><br />And don't miss Arnold's first \\"I'll be back!\\" line, long before Terminator.  :)Terminator.  :)

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this one night while waiting for my clothes to dry and ended up spending over an hour playing it.
B000784WMW|4.0|If you can get past the soap opera feel of the music, the lighting and the introduction in every episode you get to see a very good likeness of Rochester played by Timothy Dalton. I have read some of the reviews lamenting the choice of Jane in this rendition, but I have to say I enjoyed it. She is as I would have imagined from the book. The newest 2011 is entirely too dark for me. They try to make it sexually tense and it fails. We are so caught up in fast-paced food, tv, life, movies. I like that this rendition is timed for what life was like when it was written-slowed and savored.
B007AL48UK|3.0|just updated to new version. Not Good. cards are smaller and don't have a distinct edge. whole game moves on screen. takes more space on my &quot;Fire&quot; will not update anymore of my mahjong games!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game if I had it.if I got to play it I would kiss it so much because its awesome. mannnnnnnnnnnnn
B003291CBW|3.0|The book was insightful and helped explain the other Fascist country in Europe that we don't think about much anymore - Spain.  It's very interesting to read it now while following the misinformation being presented daily about the debt crisis occurring in Europe.  Orwell's perspective on human behaviour and his morality helps keep the narrative going, but I couldn't finish the book in one sitting.  If you like Animal Farm and 1984, his recollections help put into perspective how he got the inspiration for his fiction.
B005CGI4EG|4.0|It's a great show and a long episode list.<br />lots of entertainment value for a low price.<br />it's been repackaged to be cheaper but also more inconvenient.<br /><br />in my opinion, it's well worth the low price tag for all 5962 minutes of this ballsy sitcom.<br /><br />maybe i just love it because i relate to al yet love seeing him miserable.<br />i will recommend to others.

0345536886|5.0|I loved the book.  It was like his old novels.  Another entertaining lawyer read with colorful characters.  I loved the opening with the main character getting totally sloshed.
0307341550|4.0|I really enjoy reading this book...this book have things in it that I never thought of before...the twist at the end made me appreciate the book even more. I thought Flynn did a beautiful job with ending the book how she did. However, if I'm truthful, I must say I saw the twist before the reader ever was introduced to it. Therefore, I must get give this book a 4 out of 5 stars. Please don't let my 4 out of 5 stars stop you from reading this novel because it's brilliant and beautiful. The characters are horrifying and horrendous that will leave you on the edge of your seat. So go and pick this one if you love books of transgression and redemption.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My cable started to fray - I called customer service and they told me to order a new one and send them the order number, I did that and they re-imbursed me the cost - that is fantastic customer service!!  I love me Kindle!!
030758836X|5.0|ay good-bye to your loves ones...Say good-bye to your extra time...Say good-bye to the time as you now know it....While you are reading this book, you will abandon the people love, your extra time will be spent in the pages of \\"Gone Girl\\", and your time will be sent in a world where a wife is missing and the husband is the cause.<br /><br />What can I say? This is one of the best books I read this year.... It has everything....sex, drama, excitement, twist, comedy, and tragedy. All these elements are effortlessly written by an author that is going places in the literature word. Gillian Flynn has done such a great job with the development of these characters that I had a deep emotional connection and awareness of them. If you are fan of great books, you have to pick this book up TODAY!!!!! I can't wait to see what Gillian Flynn have for us in her next novel.. Too bad it's going to bea year or two until she writes another. Stay tune book lovers because Flynn has place her finger print in the world of literature.

B006LRUVUA|4.0|I would have given this app 5 stars, but the nagging to ensure private free use is obnoxious!  Perhaps they shpuld condider a small, private use license (HINT-HINT!!!)  for those pf us that would gladly pay.  The commercial licemse is prohibitively expensive (in the neighborhood of >$800 per license!!)<br /><br />In the end, I'll tolerate the annoyance since it gives me full and complete access to my home PC, including my web cam...<br /><br />All in all, this is the best app on my phone. Period...
B008IGP8RI|5.0|I've been anticipating this movie and soundtrack since I heard that Nick Cave was writing the screenplay four years ago.  It does not disappoint!  It was a nice surprise to hear some bluegrass icons, but even better to hear them in the cacophonous, rambling style that is clearly and unmistakably Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.  Burnin' Hell carries the album, and End Crawl reminds me of their music for The Road and The Proposition.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What else needs to be said.  The Dark Knight is the best superhero movie yet made.  Heath Ledger gave the best performance ever in a superhero movie, his performance deserved the Oscar.  Was the movie Oscar worthy as a whole?  Probably not, but for what it is, it's great.

0451228375|2.0|Ken Follett is a gifted writer. It is also clear that in developing any of his many novels, he carefully researches the cultural and historical contexts so that he can be as accurate as possible. This is also true for \\"World Without End.\\"<br /><br />But here's the problem: he brings the same exact characters into each book: the male hero who wants to do the right thing, his love interest who is brash and has feminist leanings but doesn't care, the evil villain who does not have a decent bone in his body, and a child of the hero with some mysterious intrigue about his/her parentage. Years ago, I read a few of Follett's novels and found this to be the case, so I gave up reading him.<br /><br />This year, I decided to give Mr. Follett another chance, so I picked up \\"World Without End,\\" since I loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and medieval history. Sadly, this book has the same problems I listed in the previous paragraph. In my opinion, it should have been titled \\"A Dangerous Fortune Meets Pillars of the Earth.\\" Here's why I say that: it's about the descendants of the main characters in \\"Pillars.\\" But just as in \\"Dangerous Fortune,\\" here the story begins with the main characters meeting as small children, being told a dangerous secret, then having it be revealed roughly three decades later. The whole time, I couldn't help but think I had read this before...because I had.<br /><br />In short, if you haven't read one of Follett's books, you might enjoy \\"World Without End.\\" But if you have, be warned: all you're going to be doing is re-reading about characters from his other books--just in a different historical context.
0345803485|2.0|I only started reading the books because a friend gave then to me and then I guess I also wanted to see what all the hype was about. I have to say that life is too short to read stuff like this. By that I am not talking about the content as much as the fact that they are very poorly written and so repetitous that I swear that I will scream if I have to read about \\"my inner goddess\\" once more. I am not going to finish all the books because there is a whole world of great books out there that I am missing out on while wasting my time with these. I must say that I still have NO idea what all the hype is about.

0385342063|5.0|Let me start off by saying I LOVED THIS BOOK.  I originally got it through my local library and liked it so much I had to buy it.  I also purchased the audio version which is FABULOUS.<br /><br />The characters are well crafted. There was so many times I found myself smiling or laughing aloud.  Still, the story is sweet and poignant.  Very heart-tugging.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give it a try.
B000002AH1|5.0|I don't see this music as dark, like other reviews said. It's funky and upbeat - sure got that groove! One way to think about this album is to compare it with its famous predecessor. Bitches Brew was more of a group improvization with solos peeking through the dense sonic sludge here and there. This album seems to be more focused, the solos are more individual and virtuosic.  The playing is more intense, the textures less dense, due to a smaller lineup. You can finally hear what John MacLaughlin is capable of, which was only hinted at in the Brew. Miles himself lays down some burning extended solos. Keith Jarrett's piano solos are imaginative and innovative. His chord voicings are very progressive and often quite unusual for that style of music. Jack DeJohnette's polyrhythmic patterns are loose and sometimes his drums seem to explode.<br /><br />This music is Miles' third onslaught on the musical foundations of the time. He bulldozes everything that he himself helped to build and then rebuilds it from scratch. He does not spare anything including rock and soul music, which is destroyed and reconstructed according to his own twisted vision. Sounds violent... but musical violence is better than exploding napalm, etc. Maybe it can soothe the unruly human mind, like fighting fire with fire. Miles Davis was something of a medicine man! There are pensive moments, Little Church and Nem Um Talvez,  abstract, spacy soundscapes, like a temporary stillness during the storm, where you can take refuge and think of what just took place.<br /><br />Stunning album graphics take album art a step further into a new dimension. This album confirms what the Brew declared - we can never listen to music in the same way again...
B00432QAKK|5.0|I grew up watching Married with Children and I was excited to see them come out on DVD, but with 11 seasons I was not going to pay $20 per season. I actually started watching the first season online when I thought they have to have a complete series. I found it here for $50 that was a steal, I didn't even think twice before I purchased it. I have it and love watching the earlier season that I was too young two watch and can't wait for the ones I do remember.<br /><br />The extras could have been more, but since this show was before the time of DVDs and Special Features it is okay. The first season has the Reunion special they had some years after the show ended and the rest of the extras are extra footage from special that they couldn't fit into a 30 min special. If you are a fan of this show I highly recommend this for the price.  I would have paid probably $100 for it since there are 11 seasons.

B000F8O35U|5.0|This is my all-time favorite Disney movie and my favorite movie ever!  I love the songs, I love the characters, and I love the journey this movie takes me on.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is quite possibly the most famous silent movie star of the late 1920's. Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo) is a talented young dancer hoping to break in on the Hollywood scene. One day, in an incredible twist of fate, Valentin and Miller meet on set. Inevitably, sparks fly between the two as they create magic on screen. Their paths cross over the next several years, until the arrival of the \\"talkies\\" revolutionizes the film industry, sending their careers in completely opposite directions.<br /><br />There was a lot of talk about The Artist prior to its release. Critics raved about it. It swept the Oscars winning a total of five Academy Awards, including Best Actor, Best Director and the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me--Best Picture. In an interesting side note, it's the only silent film to take home the award for Best Picture in Oscar history, like ever. So with all the hype, was the movie even worth it? There's only one answer to that question... YES.<br /><br />Now, I don't know if you've ever seen a silent film. I have and I have to say, they are a lost art. There's something so beautiful about their way of storytelling--it's poignant and meaningful, much more so than many of the movies produced today. And don't let the \\"silent\\" part fool you. \\"Silent\\" is sort of a misnomer because it's not like these movies are without sound. There are sound effects that echo strategically behind a masterfully crafted score. It's these sound effects and music that set the mood for the audience, helping to tell a huge part of the story. Being filmed in classic silent film fashion, 1.33:1 aspect ratio, Hazanavicius has kept the true feel of that bygone era, allowing the viewer to really experience the film as it should be experienced. What we're given is a collection of whimsical moments that rely on showing instead of telling. It becomes very clear that showing is one of Hazanavicius' strongest suits.<br /><br />When you have a silent film, I think the most important thing of all is creating chemistry. Without chemistry between the actors, you have nothing but jumble of random events. The chemistry that Jean Dujardin and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo share on screen is undeniably strong, perhaps because of their work together on prior films. Dujardin exudes total charm and charisma, and Bejo, nothing but grace and enthusiasm. They move together with so much skill and flair, I could hardly pry my eyes away from the screen. They are completely mesmerizing. And with cameos by John Goodman, James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller, you're hard pressed to find a more talented cast of characters. But the irrefutable scene stealer of this movie is Valentin's precious pooch, Jack (aka Uggie). Seriously. Who can resist that face?<br /><br />Yes. I do mean to say, the dog stole the show. But what I find most impressive about this film was the way it made me feel. I don't think I've ever felt so much when I've watched a movie before. The Artist was compelling, endearing, funny, sad and wistful. It made me hope, laugh, smile and cry. Like it or not, this film latches on to your heartstrings and won't let go. There is nothing you can do but surrender yourself to its magic and be genuinely happy that you're along for the ride. Michel Hazanavicius has created something truly extraordinary, and like the silent movies of the past, something that is sure to become a classic for all time.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Michel Hazanavicius has not only nailed it, he's done silent films a great service with this masterpiece. I find it incredibly amazing that one film can say so much without really saying anything at all. Let me be candid with you, if I may. This. Film. Did. Not. Need. Words. In all my enthusiasm for entertainment, I rarely classify any movie as perfect, but The Artist was in every sense of the word, sheer perfection. It is, to date, the most joyful film I've ever had the pleasure to see.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5stars
B0007KTBIU|5.0|I absolutely love this movie but the end makes me want to cry.  I kept hoping she would jump off that cliff and swim to the ship to be with John.  I know Pocahontas never had a romantic relationship with John Smith but they belonged together in this film.  Since when does Disney care about historical accuracy?  They've changed plenty of movies adapted from historic events or books to appeal to children.  Nevertheless, this remains one of my favorites.

Xoxo-Loving Reader!
0375850864|5.0|Fabulous short middle-grade novel that holds the interest of adult readers, too.<br /><br />This novel really knocked my socks off.  Key story:  I got it out of the library (for a course I'm taking), read it, and said, \\"I can't believe this didn't win the Newbery!  It's so good!  I HAVE to read the book that beat it.\\"  So I checked online and ... yep, it DID win the Newbery.  My library copy was put out before it won so it didn't have the medallion on the cover.  That's how good this book is; I couldn't believe it didn't win the Newbery.<br /><br />I could rave about all the things it does well, but I'll just highlight one that other reviewers might not comment on.  The number of characters vividly brought to life in this short novel is amazing.  There are about a dozen people that I will remember for a long time.<br /><br />Wow.  Keep up the good work, Rebecca Stead!

B008MM9630|1.0|When the game reset and needed reloading - all that was recoverable from the site was 10 days old. , All purchases, rewards earned, etc. was lost.  Repeated daily email for help have been  totally ignored for 2 weeks and counting.  If you play, expect glitches and any money invested should be permanently considered as an entertainment expense and no residual value received.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I really enjoyed this book and how much it sucked me in.  When I first picked it up, I was mad at myself for starting it at 9:30 pm and quickly realizing that I had work the next day but couldn't put the book down.  It was definitely a page turner and very exciting.  You kept wanting to know what would happen next.  The concept is very cool and it had a good moral at the end.<br /><br />However, there were a few problems.  My problems with it were that there were way too many extremely long chase scenes and the ending.  I loved this book but the ending seemed like it was written up so quickly and sloppily that I was very much disappointed.  I had such high hopes for the ending because I had been so confused for most of the book and then the ending just came and went.  It answered a few of my questions but left me asking several more.  I am a very analytical and detail-oriented person and the ending was frustrating in that it left a lot of holes in the story and didn't explain much.  Several things did not add up when you thought back to strange occurrences from the story and compared them with the \\"explanation\\" at the end.<br /><br />The book starts off with a guy waking up and not knowing where he is or why he is bruised and bleeding and in so much pain.  Then it goes on with him trying to piece together what happened and how he ended up in this strange town where everything is a little too perfect.  He can't reach his family, he can't find his belongings, he can't leave the town and nothing seems to make any sense.  I wish I could explain more but if I get any more specific, it'll give away what the book is about and spoil it for you.<br /><br />Overall, it was a good book, but the potential to be amazing was right in the author's hands and he let it slip through his fingers.<br /><br />I give it 3.5 stars.
0679720200|5.0|In Camus's L'Etranger you have the absurd murder and you have the official murder,you have lived experience,and the official account of that experience,the inadequacy of language and the absurdity of the world.Meursault is the poor man stripped naked who lives in the present,for the here and now with intensity,immediacy, spontaneity,pleasure and happiness.He does not sacrifice the pleasures of today for an imaginary future or another world.The words `guilt' and `sin' mean nothing to him,the language of the court and the chaplain,the word `love' likewise is something he doesn't understand.He has a lucidity and awakening in the presence of the imposed sentence of the court,in the presence of death,that he is fundamentally happy.The murder he committed is understandable if not excusable,it happened by chance;but the judicial crime of execution is inexorable,put in place by social mechanisms that pay no heed to Meursault's feelings,that commit rational murder.It was human justice-for not crying at his mother's funeral-that had condemned him not divine.Mersault says he did wrong and was paying for it and there was nothing more that could be asked of him,he won't feel remorse nor guilt,nor believe in God.<br /><br />The story's opener is one of the all time classic openers:\\"Maman died today,or maybe yesterday,I don't know\\".The climax of the novel is the best ever written:\\"The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun.

B004UJAYEY|1.0|The edition of this book is very bad with plenty of spelling errors which at times make sentences difficult to understand. example: \\"eveque\\" (bishop) nine times out of ten is printed as \\"evoque\\" (to evoke), \\"maintenant\\" (now)becomes \\"main tenant\\" (hand holding (?))the first name \\"Boniface\\" at one stage becomes \\"Bon il face\\" (good he face (?)) and so on and so forth.<br /><br />Very sloppy work from Amazon for one of the most important French novel of the XIX century.
0140015183|5.0|In Camus's L'Etranger you have the absurd murder and you have the official murder,you have lived experience,and the official account of that experience,the inadequacy of language and the absurdity of the world.Meursault is the poor man stripped naked who lives in the present,for the here and now with intensity,immediacy, spontaneity,pleasure and happiness.He does not sacrifice the pleasures of today for an imaginary future or another world.The words `guilt' and `sin' mean nothing to him,the language of the court and the chaplain,the word `love' likewise is something he doesn't understand.He has a lucidity and awakening in the presence of the imposed sentence of the court,in the presence of death,that he is fundamentally happy.The murder he committed is understandable if not excusable,it happened by chance;but the judicial crime of execution is inexorable,put in place by social mechanisms that pay no heed to Meursault's feelings,that commit rational murder.It was human justice-for not crying at his mother's funeral-that had condemned him not divine justice.Mersault says he did wrong and was paying for it and there was nothing more that could be asked of him,he won't feel remorse nor guilt,nor believe in God.<br /><br />The story's opener is one of the all time classic openers:\\"Maman died today,or maybe yesterday,I don't know\\".The climax of the novel is the best ever written:\\"The sea carried up a thick, fiery breath. It seemed to me as if the sky split open from one end to the other to rain down fire. My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. The trigger gave; I felt the smooth underside of the butt; and there, in that noise, sharp and deafening at the same time, is where it all started. I shook off the sweat and sun. I knew that I had shattered the harmony of the day, the exceptional silence of a beach where I'd been happy. Then I fired four more times at the motionless body where the bullets lodged without leaving a trace.

B005OZ4E3A|2.0|After two months, yes I know, I was playing the CD in the car when a friend said these famous words.. 'dude, this is Spanish, not Italian...'.. When I got home I realized they shipped me the Spanish version (order stated specifically that it was Italian (which is also the original version). I emailed and got the following answer.. Please ship the CD back because we don't have it in stock (the original Italian version). I emailed some time later asking if they had the original version, nada.. I'm still pissed because shipping it back is like 20 bucks and it wasn't my fault.
0143119680|4.0|I got this book on the advice of my friend who is my local expert on the vampire romance genre.  I read a lot of fantasy and sci-fi, and I had run across reviews in a few other places by then. Overall I enjoyed the book - it was a good light read in the sense that it's really all about the romance and the history bits are just icing, though clearly they are well thought out and definitely add to the story. A lot of people have been impressed by the science but I do genetics research for a living and I (inevitably) thought those parts were hilariously simplistic and implausible. That did not particularly detract from enjoying the book though. Some other features like \\"vampires doing yoga\\" were also unintentionally funny.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the storytelling. The first few chapters were super awkward to me - she's very much \\"tell\\" and not enough \\"show\\".  After a while I got into the characters and the story picked up well. I did think she overuses the plot device of sort of creating suspense by having Matthew not tell Diana things - which then become drama when she finds out - to advance the plot for 5 seconds and then she forgives him completely! He's sort of hard to like really and it is not in the character that is built up for Diana to be so passive.
