B0015Z7VD8|3.0|I ended up buying this series of books for my K2 after we watched the film \\"Five Children & IT\\" recently. I have really enjoyed reading all three of these books. The conversion is pretty good. No missing words or strange characters to speak of. Underscores are used before and after words that were probably italicized in the DTB versions.<br /><br />Although they are \\"children's literature\\" the language and the time period make them interesting for any adult who enjoys fantasy or time-period stories.<br /><br />***NOTE*** This book in particular had strange margin issues.  It was almost as if the conversion was meant for a wider device (??)  I tried different font sizes, but it didn't ever go to even close to \\"full justification\\" of the lines.  After a while though, the book was so engrossing that I no longer noticed it!
0201626632|4.0|I just read A PhD is Not Enough in just two sittings.  I'm a 4th year PhD student in engineering and I thought this book was thoroughly helpful.  I've noticed a common theme among other reviews which imply that the concepts presented in this book should be obvious to anyone enrolled in a graduate school environment.    While that's somewhat true, the problem is that depending on several factors (the culture of your university, your relationship with your advisor, your lab environment, etc.), it can take too long to figure these concepts out on your own, perhaps even long enough that your chances for success are sabotaged are at least improbable.  I do agree that with time in graduate school, Feibelman's observations become more and more clear to see, but you really need this information before you begin.      What I'm saying is that people should read this book when considering graduate school in science or engineering in the first place.  Is all the advice perfect?  I doubt it.  But it very effectively gets the ball rolling and exposes the key issues that you need to keep in mind.
6305736650|5.0|I've watched and re-watched this movie at least 25 times. Bogart and Bergman were the a perfect couple that were not meant to be, making this deeply political film portrayed in a love story set in Casablanca truly amazing, beautiful, wonderful. Has to be watched in the black and white version to get the full effect. AAA+ 5 stars, highly recommended.
0375413405|5.0|I bought volume one and volume two of this timeless masterpiece. I've never done any French cooking before. Thanks to the authors I was able to make dishes that far surpassed anything I've made before. Some of the recipes were incredibly simple to make (ex. Quiche Lorraine) and were much tastier than expected. The one I made this evening, chicken fricassee, kicked my butt, but was immensely delicious. I'm (just) a guy and can only pay attention to a limited number of things. My wife interrupting me from time-to-time was a serious distraction while making this recipe. Keep this in mind while contemplating making more complex dishes.<br /><br />The recipes are VERY clearly described. The index in the back is the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />This book deserves all the praise it gets. The only caveat is that you need to engage is some serious physical exercise to burn off the calories you so happily added while eating those delicious meals you made from this book.<br /><br />Since I bought this book and its companion, I've purchased DVD sets and other books by Julia Child. All are worthwhile investments. My wife and I don't need to go out. I can make better meals than any restaurants we've been to--thanks to this book.<br /><br />One more thing: I followed all the recipes to the LETTER--no shortcuts, no compromises.

B001XJEKGC|5.0|I challenge anyone who loves electric blues to watch Clapton's version of Double Trouble from this performance and tell me who has ever played the guitar with more fire and passion. On Had to Cry Today and Voodoo Chile too, Clapton plays better than I've ever heard him play before, and I have live recordings from throughout his career, from John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and Cream all the way up to the concert captured here. I saw him only once, in 1974, and his performance on this DVD is much better. Winwood is one of my favorite musicians and his character and virtuosity shine in most every song. Glad may be the gem of the whole set.     Many others rate the DVD by the technical specs, DTS audio, blah, blah, blah. Clapton and Winwood are two of the most talented musicians performing today, and their show-stopping performance captured at MSG earns the 5 stars. The sounds and picture are great too.

0199536481|5.0|Dangerous Liasons was published in 1782 in France just seven years before the French Revolution toppled the aristocratic world in depicts with slicing irony and wit. It is an epistolary novel meaning that it contains nothing but letters written by the characters. In these letters De Laclos reveals the characters of the novel in their most intimate moments of literary labor. The epistolary novel was popular in the eighteenth century as is manifested by such works as Samuel Richardson's Clarissa and Pamela. The form was much loved by Miss Jane Austen.<br />  This novel tells the sordid story of two arch monsters in the high reaches of the French aristocracy. Valmont and Madame Merveuil are erstwhile lovers who enjoy playing amorous games with the foolishly naive characters they seek to trap in their nefarious net. Merveuil seeks to have Valmont seduce young Cecile who is about to be married to a rich soldier who has been jilted by Merveuil. Valmont also plans on seducing a married woman who resides on an estate in the French countryside. Valmont ends us seducing both women with tragic consequences for all concerned.<br />  Valmont is killed in a duel by another lover of Cecile. Cecile enters a convent while her young lover goes to Malta. Madame Merveuil is banished by Paris society, becomes ill, loses an eye and is forced to flee to Holland. Justice is served as the cruel characters meet their fate though they do irreparable harm to those innocents who have been the mice to their cattish plots.<br />  The novel is divided into four parts with almost 200 letters included. It is as if the reader is allowed to open the mail of these characters!<br />The book deals strictly with the romantic entanglements of the major figures. Social and political concerns are not discussed; it is clear, howevere, that the society in this novel is topheavy with lazy and amorous aristocrats who have nothing better to do than engage in sexual imbroglios.<br />  De Laclos holds your attention as we sink into the depths of moral depravity with the odious Valmont. The book has been made into an excellent film with Annette Benning and John Malkovich in the title roles. This is an excellent French classic novel.o the depths of moral depravity with the odious Valmont.

B001V5K3T6|5.0|This is a DVD Book.  I read it on my TV.  Which is great because the size of the print is proportional to the size of the television screen.  For people with vision problems like me, this makes reading possible again.
B000W00FB2|5.0|Portishead's follow-up to Dummy is more abstract and eerie,but nevertheless just as good, if not better. There is a foreboding quality to the music; it is heavy and tortured but also mellow at times, as in the first single, Only You. If you are a fan you will be certainly pleased but this is also recommended for any fan of trip-hop and electronica.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica figured out that if anything was lacking on their previous few albums (And Justice For All... especially) it was sonic clarity, proper mixing, engineering, and production. Many cry that the inclusion of Bob Rock was Metallica selling out and reaching for a larger market. I disagree, they realized that there sound needed some more muscle and Bob Rock was the guy that knew how to properly record and capture a strong sound. I know the album is not as fast as some of their earlier work \\"Master Of Puppets\\" clocks in at 220 bpm, or as orchestrated and lengthy as \\"And Justice For All...\\" \\"Through the Never\\" is the fastest track on the album at 188bpm and each song is orchestrated in a more efficient manor, but from a sound engineer's point of view this is a more instrumentally stripped down and heavier album then the previous. The audience can actually hear the bass guitar and the notes that James and Kirk are playing.<br /><br />I do agree with a previous reviewer that this is some of Kirk's strongest and most logical work yet. He appears to be more concentrated on the dynamics and feeling of each songs melodic and lyrical theme and adds to that were as before he would concentrate more on chord progression and speed. He's always been a great lead guitarist to listen to and this time he lets it all hang out: Tapping, Hammering, Tremolo picking, Wah-wah petal, Whammy bar, clean, dirty and harmonious. He does a wonderful job summing up what he's done before while leaping forward.<br /><br />James blew his voice out during the early stages of recording this album and decided that it was time to seek professional help. He has a very powerful voice that wasn't previously exploited due to the fact that he had no knowledge of proper technique or tone. Also, James steps outside himself here with the inclusion of \\"Nothing Else Matters\\". A song that he didn't want to appear on any Metallica record, but was nagged by Lars to do so. James explains in many interviews that he was playing this one day by accident when Lars heard it and asked what it was, James expressed that it wasn't Metallica material but was something he would rather keep to/for himself. Lars objected and said that it should be a Metallica song, and history was made. James also explores some things hear that previously Metallica had only flirted with. The more Spanish yet melancholy progression in \\"The Unforgiven\\" comes to mind, The Arabian harmonic minor theme throughout \\"Wherever I May Roam\\", as well as the simpler song structures of \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True\\".<br /><br />Jason can be heard through out and has a very powerful yet clear sound. On the \\"Year and Half in the Life of\\" documentary Jason, with the help Bob Rock, fought hard for some of his ideas to be on this record and a great deal of them do appear but unfortunately they are uncredited except for \\"My Friend Of Misery\\". Jason's performance and melodic choices on this album really compliment everything that is going on and it leaves me wondering how much better \\"And Justice For All...\\" would have been with the production and engineering of this record allowing for his performance to be heard.<br /><br />Lars lays back a bit on this album and tries to compliment the bass lines and powerful moments of the songs with out distracting from the lyrics or the melodies and harmonies James and Kirk are playing. He still impresses the percussionist out there with his more technical and complicated rhythms sections especially on the middle of \\"Through The Never\\". He accents \\"The Unforgiven\\" with some nice bass and cymbal crashes and \\"peppery\\" snare compliments.<br /><br />The people who complain that Metallica sold-out here either must hate clear and defined guitar tones, drums that don't blast the whole time and over take the mix, a singer that uses a full range of his voice (finally) and that you can understand, and bass that cuts through the music and adds punch. Or, seriously miss the point that, musically, there are a lot of things going on in each of these songs at any given moment it's just not at the break-neck speeds they used to happen. This time James and the boys focused on the quality of the sound rather than the quantity of the sound.<br /><br />I recommend this album should be in any one's collection. It's honest, it's American and it's a bridge between metal and rock that hadn't been made until this time. Many fans/people complain this album was about selling out, while at the same time many musicians strive to capture the raw yet polished and heavy sound Metallica produced on this record. I don't even know if they [Metallica] could (or would) do it again., there are a lot of things going on in each of these songs at any given moment it's just not at the break-neck speeds they used to happen.

B000Y8GFY8|5.0|Certainly a departure from Supernature, Goldfrapp's latest album is nevertheless reminiscent of Felt Mountain, their debut. But where Felt Mountain explored twilight soundscapes, Seventh Tree basks in a sunny meadow. The music is for the most part happy and uplifting, with touches of folk and unobtrusive synths. There's some heartbreak too, as in the gorgeous first single A&E and the haunting and sensual Road to Somewhere. If you're a fan of chill-out music or a Goldfrapp fan, this is a must have.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is one of my favorite Jane Austen stories. I loved this movie. I thought it was done very well. The expressions on Anne's face when she meets Frederick again is just heartbreaking! Loved the chemistry between Ciran Hinds and Amanda Root is just wonderful. They both made you feel the love they have for each other. If you are ever wondering which version of Persuasion to get this is it. The newer one fails in comparison and the older ones just seem dated. Yes I must say this is one of my all time favorites. It's 2nd only to Pride and Prejuice!
B0018O4YT0|5.0|About Jeff Shannon's review of Dark City:    I've been a fan of this movie since I first saw it on cable in 1998.  I purchased the DVD not long after, and this Director's Cut is a true \\"cut above.\\"  Its additional 11 minutes answers questions and fills gaps, and all-in-all provides a completely satisfying sci-fi-noir experience.  This is a film best seen more than once - because once you do, you know that its characters have all the dimension they need.  After all - the plot IS about humans who have no permanent character traits, since the strangers are constantly shifting their memories and character \\"dimensions\\" around.      Is Dark City \\"a triumph of production design?\\"  Of course it is.  Is it a \\"classic?\\"  ABSOLUTELY.  If you stop and think about it, no small part of what makes Blade Runner a \\"classic\\" is a terrific cast which includes Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer.  While Dark City doesn't boast that star power, Rufus Sewell, a young Jennifer Connelly, and William Hurt are \\"just right\\" in their roles.    Is it \\"painfully clear\\" that Dark City \\"has precious little heart and soul?\\"  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  What IS painfully clear is that Amazon.com allows people to write their reviews who have \\"precious little heart and soul\\" when it comes to recognizing an outstanding example of a genre and giving credit where credit is due.      Shame on you, Amazon.com, for allowing such a narrow mind to write a review under your by-line.  Anyone who thinks this film is \\"style over substance\\" just doesn't get it.
B000002LIX|5.0|It's really hard to put this album's greatness into words.    After the release of Jane's first major album Nothing's Shocking, the listener probably would have expected similar rocking frolicking songs that dealt with the bands familiar surroundings, psychedlic California, Oceans, beaches, all to a passionate driving rocking beat.    Ritual at first opens the same with an ingenious hooks of its predecessor album, and by the time Perry screams HERE WE GO! on the opening track \\"Stop\\" you have to hang on tight for the ride.  For the most part you are, the bands killer greatness is still in awesome display, as everything just grooves so easily.    By the time the first half of the album is over on the funky participatory \\"Been caught stealing\\", the fun is to continue with more wacky, funky, rocking, obtuse and maddnening tracks.  This is what alternative back in the day really meant.  This album sometimes sounds like something the Rolling Rocking Stones could do, then it goes into guitar effect weirdness, then it gets funky, then it gets pounding metal blasts, you just cant get enough.  However, once the listener is brought to the second half of the album everything changes for this band into a solidly grooving fun jaunt, to awe inspiring godlike proportions.    The pinacle and highlight track that starts the second half of the album is \\"Three Days\\".  A nearly 11 minute epic song that I can only describe as the equivalent of alternative music's Stairway to Heaven.  It is a song that slowly builds... builds... and washes over the listener into an epic explosion.. that leaves you completly spent after hearing it.  It is hands down one of the best songs I have EVER heard in my life (and I listen to a LOT of different music from all sorts of styles).  It also has one of the best guitar solos done in the form of Dave Navarro who is probably the most underated guitar player on the planet.    Finally, the second half continues into a sombre more introspective and somewhat saddneing but brilliant brooding of songs like Then She Did, and a perfect closer in Classic Girl, where you felt you heard the best lullaby ever as Perry in a barely audible whisper at the end says \\"good night\\".  It is some of the most personal and heart wrenching stuff I have had to listen to from an artist.. it really seems impossible that the band can convey the emotion of the words being said but they did, and it hits like a brilliant wallop.    At first listen this album is incredibly hard to digest.  In many ways it is almost too much, it is the equivalent of sonic overload in trying to digest all the imaginative and personal lyrics penned by Perry Ferrel, the incredibly wild and layered guitar tracks of Navarro (there's about 4-5 going on at the same time during Three Days), to Eric's driving bass riffs that start many of the tunes such as Ain't No Right.. all while Stephen Perkins pounds out like a mad man.    I had this album in the early 90's on tape, and flipping it from the two sides was the equivalent of listening to 2 different moods at will, somehow it didn't even seem like they belonged on the same disc now in CD... but everything just so flows perfectly.    Been Caught Stealing was certainly and overplayed song in its hey-day, but listening to it now, there isn't anything out there that I have heard since that comes close or sounds anything like it since.    This is an absolute MUST own album...  If you want to hear one thing in your life before anything else... Three days is essential..  never mind the entire album, so pick up the whole thing.  It's a real treat.
0312370849|2.0|Julia Jarmond is an American journalist investigating the infamous Vel d'Hiv roundup of Parisian Jews by French police in July 1942 for a magazine article she's writing. The \\"Sara\\" of the title, is a young Jewish girl who was taken in the roundup along with her parents. The book begins telling the stories of Sara and Julia in alternating chapters, but halfway through, the author switches to only Julia's voice and the rest of Sara's story is summarized rather than shown. This is unfortunate since Julia is the less interesting protagonist. The back cover blurb on the paperback edition reads: In her research, Julia stumbles onto a trail of secrets that link her to Sara, and to questions about her own romantic future. And that's exactly what the book becomes, a Romance novel about an American woman in a bad marriage to a Frenchman. There are many things in the book that beg the willing suspension of disbelief: the ease with which Julia adjusts to major changes in her life, the precociousness of her preteen daughter, her amazing luck to have her sister's New York Upper West Side apartment always available to her. If only the horrors suffered by Sara were as hard to believe, but we know better.

B001C08RHA|5.0|How can this be?  A movie based on a comic book character that not only doesn't suck, it actually improves on the original story of the origins of the character!  Unlike most super hero movies, Iron Man is mostly an unknown and therefore easier to work with without totally ruining it for anyone who read and followed the old comics.  That said, this is just a great movie with a smart story and excellent casting.  Absolutely great to own and can't wait for the sequel.
B002B4AAS0|2.0|Blinking Lights was powerful when Everett slowed things down.  This album's best tracks are the quicker tempo songs.  The slow stuff on this one I find to be boring.  If I could do it over knowing what I know now I would only download \\"Fresh Blood\\", \\"Whats a Fella Gotta Do\\" and \\"Tremendous Dynamite\\".  Some of the other songs are decent, but those three are easily the best, and well worth a buck each.
0739365916|4.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books featuring the enigmatic loner Jack Reacher, and this review is specifically about the unabridged Audio Book read by Dick Hill.  Dick Hill has read the copy for all the Jack Reacher novels and his voice is my favorite of all time, and he is perfect as Jack Reacher.  In fact, I can't imagine any voice other than Hill's being attached to Reacher.    In this installment of Reacher's nomadic life, trouble once again finds him on a New York City subway car in the wee hours of the morning where he witnesses the bizarre suicide of a middle aged woman.  This leads to a rather improbable, but fun, confluence of events that make Reacher a fugitive from a terrorist cell, the New York City cops and just about every named and unnamed Federal law enforcement agency in existence.    Under any other circumstances, Reacher might have simply moved passed the suicide, but for the fact the suicide victim was suspected of carrying classified information and everyone thinks Reacher has it, since he was the last one to speak to the victim before she died.  As is typical for Child's novels, Reacher collects an assortment of enemies and wary allies along the way to the inevitable showdown with the forces of evil.  Also along the way, Reacher escapes from Federal detention, goes subway surfing, and has a romantic interlude with a beautiful NYC police officer.  Thanks to one ally, Reacher goes into his final battle with some interesting gear that includes a Heckler and Koch MP5-SD-4 and a Benchmade 3300 Infidel special operator's knife.    If you are, as I am, a fan of the Jack Reacher series, I'm sure you'll find this yarn satisfying.  My only criticism is that in this novel and in the previous Nothing to Loose, Child has endeavored to broaden his story lines from the smaller mysteries like the hunt for an assassin in the riveting One Shot, or the murder mystery in Running Blind.  These larger conspiracies are harder to tie together and the story lines aren't quite as tight and sharp as many earlier works.    But despite my minor quibbles, I enjoyed this book immensely and I'll be anxiously awaiting my annual summertime fix for the next Jack Reacher novel.
B001QWBM62|5.0|The Zoom H4N is a great recorder.  It allows me to lay down a guitar solo track, rhythm track and using the Zoom effects I can use my own guitar for a bass. You have a selection of several different bass types.    It is a sophisticated product and requires time to learn all the functions.  The one negative with this and many electronics is the instructions. Zoom really needs to create a video on their website to go through ALL the different functions to help learn to use their product with less hassel.
B00000J7J7|5.0|This is not your typical jazz piano album.  This is simply beautiful new music that resists being labeled as either jazz or classical.  Each piece is organized around a concept, which also has a place in the song cycle.  As the title suggests, the music is reflective, which does not mean that it is not highly charged.  Brad Mehldau's performance is emotionally exposed.  His impressive technical command of the keyboard and rhythmic precision allow him to convey his highly original musical ideas.  I would rate this music to be among the most important new music written for solo piano.  If the sheet music were available written out note for note, pianists around the world would be performing it instead of Schumann, Ravel, Debussy, or Scriabin.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Mickey Rourke has always been a favorite of mine. I thought that he was great in Body Heat, The Pope of Greenwich Village, and so many others. It was nice to hear that he had made a big comeback with his Oscar-nominated role in The Wrestler.     The Wrestler is a good film, but it can be painful to watch Rourke's character waste so many chances to turn his life around. Rourke stars as a washed-up pro wrestler named Randy The Ram. Randy has no money, rotten health, and no relationship with anyone who can help him.     The cast of the movie is excellent. Rourke has always been good as the tragic, not-very-bright tough guy. (Unfortunately, he's had so much (bad) plastic surgery that he barely resembles the younger Mickey Rourke). Marisa Tomei is good as a single mother and stripper who becomes Rourke's love interest. Evan Rachel Wood plays Rourke's daughter with whom he tries to mend fences.    The Wrestler is always entertaining, but it's not always easy to watch Rourke self destruct. It is well worth watching.
0321544080|5.0|After having borrowed this book from the library now I'm going to purchase it. It's one of the best and most helping book that I ever read on photography. Unlike one of the reviewers who said that this book doesn't explain how Joe took his pictures I think that he gave much of what is needed to go along his path. I'm not specifically found of National Geographic pictures or the other magazines for which Joe works. But when I see and when I read what Joe does I'm truly amazed. It just gives me the envy to start learning and learning again what I know on photography. Basically Joe's giving just the information that I need to start the journey toward better pictures.   I have also ordered his new book. And I plan to buy a remote control for my camera. And also a bunch of lightning equipment, starting with Bron and certainly some light boxes.  Joe, if you read this: Bravo for your book! and Thank you!
1416562605|5.0|My husband and I listened to the book on tape which was written by Aravind Adiga and it is an amazing story. I recommend the tape because the reader is excellent and it's so helpful to be able to hear the correct pronunciation of all the  Indian words.      Beginning with page one, where The White Tiger begins his long letter to His Excellency, Wen Jiabao, the Premier of China, this story holds you in it's grasp and it won't let you go until the very end of the book. He tells the story of his life with wit and sorrow. You learn how he changed and came to be the man that he is now!     The White Tiger began life as a poor Indian man by the name of Balram Halwai, he worked hard, and always tried to be a good and honest person until he finally learned the only way that he could survive and prosper was to break away and begin a new life.     The narrator gives a bold and terrifying look at India where the caste system marks you from your birth to your death.  Also, the corrupt government and ancient customs keep you from any kind of prosperous lifestyle.    I won't forget this story!

0142403873|5.0|The story is fun and rhymes to a fun meter and infers a moral of courage and intellect. Every Julia Donaldson book we have read is filled with the same kind of poetry and cute storytelling - she is gifted.    Both of our children, now 5 and 3, have loved this book. The different animal encounters make it easy to do some \\"voices\\" for each, although my Gruffalo voice sounds somewhat akin to Billy Bob Thornton in \\"Sling Blade\\".    My favorite Gruffalo memory, however, occurred last night when I heard our three-year son \\"reading\\" this book to his bed buddies in the dark. The story is so easy to remember that he can pretty much now recite it, which as a parent makes you all warm inside.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This movie bowled me over.  A visual feast and extremely engaging story thrown into the bargain. In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita is stolen from Rama by the great demon king and the story that follows is the quest to get her back.  Amazing how the classic love story still works so well in a modern context.  I had picked up the book and skimmed a few parts, didn't buy it.  I've read a lot of Indian authors and what I'd read of Slumdog Millionare (the novel) hadn't done much for me - it had seemed somewhat contrived, though to be fair, I didn't read the whole book.  Anyway, it was with some curiousity (and doubt) that I put this film on tonight with a friend.  Wow!  What an exciting movie! Danny Boyle has created a masterpiece.
B000GW8RX4|5.0|Rainbow was my favorite rock band when I was in junior high school back in the mid 70s.  Unfortunately, I never managed to see them in concert back then.  So, this DVD was a real treat for me since it let me see the Blackmore/Dio lineup of Rainbow that I liked the most in concert just as I might have seen them in seventh grade.    Since I already owned Rainbow's \\"Live in Europe\\" CD which captured their 1976 show, I was already familiar with the concert versions of most of the songs on this DVD.  So, the main attraction of this DVD for me was being able to see the band on video.  Since I had already seen Blackmore on a Deep Purple DVD I had recently purchased, the visual highlights of this DVD for me were seeing the young Ronnie James Dio (who looked much younger and better than he does on the 2007 Heaven and Hell DVD) and the giant electronic rainbow which spanned the stage.  While I had previously seen photographs of the rainbow, it is way cooler on video where you can see it changing colors and patterns.    As other reviewers have mentioned, the video quality is sub-par, but that is due to the limited technology of the period and is no fault of the company that released it.  The sound is clean and full in all 3 formats, but there is not as much separation between channels as I would have liked, even in the Dolby and DTS formats; it is possible that the original source was mono and that the engineers did the best they could given the source.    The extra videos, interviews, and booklet are also good.  However, my copy did not include the reproduction of the tour booklet that some reviewers mentioned.  Perhaps that was only available in a limited special edition of the DVD.  Altogether, this DVD will please any fans who love the Dio incarnation of Rainbow and approach it with realistic expectations about the video and sound quality. That's especially true if you are in your mid 40s and loved Rainbow in the mid 70s like I did.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|Originally a 4-part British miniseries, Austen's timeless story is given a modern twist - Amanda Pryce, a modern day British woman is thrust into the mannerly world of the 18th century Bennett family, while just about every gentleman falls for her.  As she tries to return home (Elizabeth Bennett has taken her place in modern day London, which unfortunately is not explored), all the characters take paths not prescribed by Austen, much to Amanda's dismay, and it is up to her to right the wrongs.<br /><br />While the plot is inventive and at first intriguing, it quickly gets old as the story drags on nearly 3 hours and starts to become redundant; it could have easily been trimmed by an hour and still told a compelling and entertaining story. The acting is outstanding, and Darcy is at his pompous best. The production values and cinematography are also first rate. A huge missed opportunity was not following Elizabeth's journey into the future filled with cars, televisions, mobile phones, and property rights for females. Definitely recommended for Austen fans.

B000002GBJ|4.0|After The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" and The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" it became a hype in the seventies to make a \\"concept album\\".  Rick Wakeman's  \\"Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" is one of those albums.  When he worked on this album he still was a member of the band 'Yes'. The other band members are on some of the tracks.    I already had the LP, but thought it was time to have a CD version.    It's a rather 'baroque' album, with Wakeman using all sorts of keyboard instruments, even a church organ!  Looking back on this work of music I was surprised to discover the compositions aren't as difficult as I thought, but have simple chords.  Could that be the reason that the album is easy to listen to?
B001SMC91M|5.0|Black Joe Lewis is as close to a 21st-Century version of James Brown as we might ever hear. Lewis' lyrics are strong and his voice is amazing. The music has the toe-tapping, hip-shaking feel of classic funk mixed with the jazz-and-blues-inspired guitars and horns (trumpet and trombone).<br /><br />If you loved James Brown you'll probably love Black Joe Lewis. The only thing you \\"might\\" need to potentially be aware of is that Lewis isn't afraid to drop a profanity or two into his lyrics ... so if you're sensitive or have small kids around you might want to keep that in mind. I personally love the lyrics.<br /><br />I'm honestly at a loss for words when it comes to talking about Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears because this is the kind of music you have to FEEL to appreciate. I could keep writing another 5,000 words in this review but not a single word would have the weight of listening to this music.<br /><br />My recommendation is to click on the audio samples on Amazon to see if this is the kind of music you like. All I can say is that this CD is now playing in heavy rotation on my iPod. I hope to hear more from Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears for many, many years to come.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|\\"Train of Thought\\" was a transitional album for Dream Theater on which they embraced a harder-edged sound, less progressive and more metallic.  It is interesting that the progressive metal band Symphony X also transitioned to a rawer sound with \\"The Odyssey\\" in 2002.  The harder-edged sound of ToT was continued by DT on \\"Octavarium\\" and \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  Based on pre-release reviews, DT's new album \\"Black Clouds & Silver Linings\\" will continue this trend.    While some fans did not like the harder sound of ToT, I enjoy the infusion of energy and appreciate DT's willingness to modify their style rather than play it safe and do more of the same.  While I liked the gentler, more progressive \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" a lot, I like \\"Train of Thought\\" and subsequent albums just as much.  But my tastes are quite eclectic, ranging from classical music to broadway musicals to jazz to hard rock.    The album kicks off with the very powerful \\"As I Am\\" which is an anthem of independence.  Basically, DT is telling their fans and critics that they're going to play the music they want to play and that everyone can either accept them as they are or listen to other bands.  I really like this song a lot, not just for the message but for their stating it with a fresh sound that challenges even those who loved their prior work to accept the fact that Dream Theater will continue to evolve.    \\"The Dying Soul\\", a continuation of Mike Portnoy's \\"Alcoholics Anonymous Suite\\" continues the intensity as does the fourth track, \\"Honor Thy Father\\" which might be DT's most angry song.  The third and fifth songs, \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" and \\"Vacant\\", provide some relief from the intensity; LaBrie delivers some poignant lyrics with heart-felt emotion.  The instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" builds off the piano riff of \\"Vacant\\" but at a faster tempo; it then explodes in a fury of energy that is sustained for an 11 minute tour-de-force.  The final song, \\"In the Name of God\\" is a critiqueof religious extremism and war in the same vein of the later DT songs \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and \\"Prophets of War\\".    Overall, this is an outstanding album.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I usually can't watch freaky movies like this, mainly cause I'm a wimp, but this one was really good, and maybe even creepier that it was based on a true story.
B000NW6OY6|4.0|I bought this wonderful book as a gift for my fiancee. It's one of her all-time favorite stories, and our previous copy had pretty much disintegrated over the years of use. This second edition hardcopy printing was a bit more worn than advertised, more stains, more yellowing, especially for the price, but it was a great surprise for her. Recommended reading, for sure.

B001URRXQQ|5.0|I love Belinda Carlisle-her voice is great, smooth and easy to listen to.  Her singing and songs are not real deep and gritty but very breezy and catchy.<br /><br />This is a must buy for fans with the inclusion of the live performance from the 80's(which I seen at Pine Knob-Clarkston,Michigan in 1988).<br /><br />Looking forward to her new cd early next year until then enjoy!
B000002JPA|4.0|This was the first Dream Theater album I ever heard, although I discovered it way after it was released in 2008 when a friend who knew I liked Rush suggested I check out Dream Theater.  I bought \\"Images and Words\\" at the same time that I bought \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".  That later album was so outstanding that it kind of overshadowed I&W.  I certainly played 6DoIT much more. That's not to say that I disliked this album.  It just failed to excite me as much as 6DoIT did.    The songs definitely have a different feeling than those on later DT albums.  While the musicianship is excellent, the band had not yet fully developed their own distinctive style.  James LaBrie sometimes sounds like Geddy Lee from Rush or Steve Perry from Journey.  They even include a saxophone on \\"Another Day\\" which I can't imagine them doing today.    The opening track, \\"Pull Me Under\\", is definitely a winner and deserves the radio and MTV airplay it got; what you probably don't realize is that the lyrics refer to Shakespeare's Hamlet.  (I only learned this just now from Wikipedia.)  \\"Another Day\\" sounds too much like Journey for my taste. \\"Take the Time\\" is more original with its sophisticated rhythms. \\"Surrounded\\" starts out blandly but then gains energy and inspiration.    The high point of the album is \\"Metropolis - Part 1\\" which eventually spawned the \\"Metropolis - Part 2: Scenes From a Memory\\" album in 1999.  It is more sophisticated than the other songs on the album and features some very good instrumental sections.    \\"Under a Glass Moon\\" also demonstrates the band's instrumental and vocal skills to good effect, but I have no clue what the lyrics are about.  \\"Wait For Sleep\\" features lovely (acoustic) piano playing from Kevin Moore accompanied by a sensitive vocal by James LaBrie, singing in a lower, more natural register; it's short but sweet.  The album wraps up with the 11 minute \\"Learning to Live\\" which features more instrumental fireworks and some high-register singing from LaBrie.  The song quotes the main piano riff from \\"Wait for Sleep\\", so maybe they should be viewed as linked.  But DT often quotes themes from one song in others, so there might not be any connection between them.    Overall, this is a good album, but it is less mature than \\"Awake\\" and their following albums.
B00028HBKM|5.0|A very moving film.  It was hard to keep form crying or yelling at the screen during certain parts of the movie, and I don't normally do either of those things during movies.
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|A great film in a decade of great films, Rocky is the tale of a palooka nobody who is given a shot at the title. It is also a look into the lives of \\"small\\" people living life in a harsh world day-to-day without dreams and little hope.<br />The training sequences, character interactions, and film score are excellent. The backdrop of the tough city of Philadelphia is almost as important part of the movie as the characters. Yet possibly the defining moment of the movie (and rightly so) is the fight at the end. An outmatched Rocky, bloodied and beaten, yet determined to go the distance, keeps coming for more.<br /> Finally, late in the fight, knocked down yet again, Rocky wills himself up even with the men in his corner urging him to stay down as Adrian watches helplessly from the crowd. In this pivotal scene, the films score is fabulous, along with the cutaways to Adrian and Apollo, whose arms, raised in triumph, slowly lower in disbelief as he sees the battered Rocky rising up from the canvas yet again for one more round. No matter how many times I watch the movie it gets me every time. A true must see.
B0026OE2O8|5.0|wow, this movie is stunningly beautiful but more importantly, it puts global issue into perspective and motivate us to change the way we live. best movie i have been thus far.    you can watch it for free in 720p HD on youtube for a limited time.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|I had the movie on DVD and I liked it so well that I wanted the Blu-ray  version of it as soon as I could find it.  The high definition version is well worth it.  I have visited India on several occasions and the high definition pictures of the countryside bring back memories that the DVD version just did not.
B000002JKA|5.0|My exposure to Dream Theater started two years ago with \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\".  Liking both of them but preferred 6DoIT. I then moved forward to \\"Octavarium\\" and \\"Systematic Chaos\\" which I thought were brilliant albums.  Recently, I've started working my way backwards through Dream Theater's discography.  With some bands, this could be a disappointing experience since their earlier works might lack the maturity or sophistication of their later albums.  But I'm pleased to report that \\"Awake\\" is a very good album that showcases the mature Dream Theater sound and musicality despite its age.    The main difference between \\"Awake\\" and \\"Images and Words\\" is that James LaBrie developed his own, more distinctive vocal style; on the previous album, he had sounded a lot like Rush's Geddy Lee. Also, the band significantly increased their use of speaking and playing of sound clips that have been featured in some songs on many DT albums. The main difference between \\"Awake\\" and more recent DT albums is that their original keyboardist, Kevin Moore, is still in the band.  While the current keyboardist, Jordan Rudess, is more talented, Moore is also quite good; on this album, he plays a lot of (non-electric) piano.    I like all the songs on the album, but my favorites are \\"Caught in a Web\\", \\"Innocence Faded\\", the 3-part \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" (which is where the album title \\"Awake\\" comes from), \\"Lie\\", \\"Lifting Shadows Off a Dream\\", and the peculiar but beautiful \\"Space-Dye Vest\\".  All of these and the others I did not list feature good melodies, vibrant instrumentals, and thoughtful lyrics.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|This is my second one. I really love this piece of work. Three years ago I bought my first and it was defective. I returned it to Swatch but could not be fixed, so, I was offered a new one of my choice and went for the Irony Chronos. It was better, but I wanted THIS one. After a long wait, last year's collection brought this model back and I bought it again. I have been watching this one close and so far works flawlessly. Beautiful design although metal strap is now lighter and carries a different pattern. Anyway, orb stayed the same and I like the new strap.
B001V9LRTM|5.0|3 hours 44 minutes 19 seconds long (edit), probably the greatest music event ever, a remarkable documentary; finally meets the sound and visual treament it always deservered (Blu-Ray and Dolby TruHD).<br /><br />For those familiar with the movie, you've never seen this film in such perfection. A pristine or incredibly well cleaned print of this film was lovingly transfered to 1080p resolution. The transfer is so good, you can actually see the grain of the film. There is no more that can be done to improve video at home. I'm pretty certain that the theater sound systems were nowhere near up to the level of home theater today. The addition of rear channels and subwoofers, and given the limitations of the original recording, just can't get better. Since this film is all about the music, what could possibly be better? There were times when the couch rattled with the power of the bass. The one nit, the surrounds tend to be a bit loud, so the soundstage gets a little confused. I'll take that any day of the week to hear this music the way it was recorded.<br /><br />For those new to Woodstock - buy this version. The music: some of the best rock, folk, and blues music ever. Hendrix, The Who, Jefferson Airplane - the gods of rock and roll. Crosby, Stills and Nash, Joan Baez, John Sebastian, Janis Joplin, Arlo Guthrie - the crossover gods of folk music. Canned Heat, Joe Cocker, Ten Years After - crossover blues.<br /><br />The Jimi Hendrix' three songs are almost worth the price alone - the greatest guitar player ever, playing to a very small crowd at the end of Woodstock (that will teach people that leave early to beat the traffic).<br /><br />The movie is what documentary film making is all about, capture the moment, render the feeling, place the audience in the event. The opening, pristine fields, interviews with locals, traffic rolling in, and the gorgeous CS&N singing Long Time Gone; followed by Canned Heat Going Up The Country; ending in CS&N Wooden Ships. The feeling is almost surreal as the site gets more and more crowded. Richie Havens opens the concert with his great acoustic guitar playing and protest songs. It's not straight linear time filming, but uses shots from different times to support the story line. Arlo Guthrie sings 'Coming into Los Angeles', a song about flying on an ariplane with a couple of keys (drug running); the visuals are of people enjoying that drug. It's almost a McGyver for how to enjoy that drug. The film cuts back occasionally to Guthrie singing at night. The director Michael Wadleigh uses split screens (twos, threes and fours) at just the right moments. The Who play and what is more important, Roger Daltry singing or Pete Townshend playing guitar? We get both with a 3 screen split, because they are both incredibly important to the performance. Wadleigh knows what is important and gives it to the viewer.<br /><br />The soundtrack to the main film was reworked in a few places. Santana's Soul Sacrafice is very obviously altered - the marachas emit sound when they are nowhere near a microphone, and the sound is specifically placed in surrounds or specific channels. It's pretty clear when this enhancement was done. Is that a crime? On the one hand, yes - it isn't what was really performed at Woodstock exactly that way. No its not a crime - you can think of these as sound effects that don't alter the feel of the performance. Purists already know what they think about this. Personally, I don't have a lot of problem with the changes.<br /><br />Disc 2 - Bonus Features. Two parts, more music and a look at behind the scenes / snapshot of life in the late 60's early 70's.<br /><br />The music - for one reason or another these performances were not included in the movie. Some, the sound wasn't recorded very well, some the film was underexposed, some acts just weren't popular enough, or some just didn't fit the story line. Frankly, pick your reason for the clip you happen to love. The description of this disc includes the play list, it's long. The great part of Blu-Ray, the music is presented as a table and you make your own playlist that you then play. It can be saved, skipped around, whatever. Great way to watch the clips. The three Amazon bonus tracks are excellent.<br /><br />The Film bonuses. This is a bit less great. In some ways it's a view at television / life in the 60's / 70's. The Hugh Hefner bit was interesting, but there was too much talking head for my taste. Playboy After Dark was an icon of the era, and it would have been way better to just play the 20 minutes of that show - instead there's only about 3 or 4 minutes of super young Hugh Hefner (and glimpses of the gorgeous young Barbie Benton next to him). Mostly these featurettes are like what you see in most movies anymore, talking heads, some clip back to the film or examples. It runs long, it runs deep. If you are addicted to Woodstock - you will enjoy this more than you can imagine. For normal humans, probably pass on this whole featurette section.<br /><br />The film is rated R for good reason. Strong language, drug use (almost a how to film), and nudity are all there. No, younger viewers should not see this. Up until the Arlo Guthrie song, would be acceptable (almost the first half of the film).<br /><br />This edition with all the funky packaging. I've posted some pictures of a more or less unboxing. The pictures inside the acrylic frame is lame - the frame is actually kind of cool (use it for another picture - it's held together with magnets). The reprinted Life Magazine is sweet. The best, in my view, is the reprinted ticket on heavy ticket stock. Frankly, all the extras aren't really worth much extra money. I would have gladly bought this as a straight no extra stuff, blu-ray edition with the two discs alone.udes the play list, it's long.

0743289692|4.0|Girl Next Door<br /><br />Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a must to read memoir if you care about women or freedom or truth or God or any collection of the basic core values on what it means to be human, be an American or care about art or free expression.<br /><br />I voted for Obama, shared tears with friends when he was elected.  But I'm a bit scared how he and Clinton behaved all nicey nice in Cairo last week, addressing \\"the Muslim World\\".  Media phrases like \\"the Muslim World\\" are beginning to frighten me after having read Ali's story.  (I've since been to Egypt on a tour bus driven by a man named Mohammed, with a tour guide named Osama, an armed guard whose name I was afraid to ask.) I wish I'd read Ali's life history when it first came out in 2007; but I'd finished a several other similar books the year before on the Islamafication of Europe (Mark Steyn's America Alone) and the like.  They all depressed me.  I should have had the courage of Hirsi Ali and kept reading.<br /><br />What's up and good about Infidel is that it is fresh, innocent, honest, funny.  She writes like the girl next door, with an innocent and guileless approach.  Yes, only this girl next door was born in Mogadishu and was raised on the run as a refugee since the age of 8.  She became numbered among Time Magazine's 100 most influential people on the planet for 2005.<br /><br />One result for me in reading Infidel: I'm tempted to whine less.  Reading this book might mean you'll be more grateful that you can speak your mind in this country, attend a rally, not worry so much about a rock or a bullet coming through your window tomorrow.  You'll value your sexual freedom a lot more, too.<br /><br />Hirsi Ali has taken a hit for many of us, as I believe she still lives in a secret location in the states surrounded by bodyguards.  It is shameful the way Holland washed their country--Home Of All Things Happy--and their hands of this woman, brave enough to simply tell the truth about the treatment of immigrant women there by men and what it means to grow up under the tyranny of fundamentalism.<br /><br />Truth, freedom, beauty, love--If these things mean anything to you, read Infidel.  And, if you've every wondered about the bootstrap power of an education, read this book.  You'll not love her dad, but you'll love his encouragement of her along the way to get an education at any cost.what it means to grow up under the tyranny of fundamentalism.

B000PTYP5C|5.0|I think this is one of Dream Theater's best albums.  It pulses with the same hard-edged energy that has permeated their albums ever since \\"Train of Thought\\".  But it also has memorable melodies such as those in \\"Forsaken\\", \\"Prophets of War\\", and \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\".  The last is especially beautiful and haunting.  Overall, the album strikes a good balance between intense metal, rich melody, and interesting story-telling.    While some reviewers have characterized some of the lyrics as juvenile, I happen to like science fiction and fantasy and appreciate that DT is telling some stories in those genres.  These stories are actually more sophisticated then you might think at first hearing and have interesting sources including a Turgenev short story and Korean and Japanese manga (comic books); check out the Wikipedia entries and related links for details.    I strongly encourage you get the special edition, not so much for the documentary video, but for the outstanding 5.1 surround sound mix. It's only an extra $7. The engineers did a wonderful job with this alternate mastering, fully exploiting the possibilities of the extra channels.  There are several points including the opening of \\"In the Presence of Enemies - Part 1\\" where the sound actually moves around between the speakers.  While this is not a realistic sound concept, it is very cool to hear.  Fortunately, the engineers did not overdo these tricks; the sound is more stable most of the time, while delivering excellent separation and depth.  In contrast, several live concert DVDs that I've purchased recently (Deep Purple, Rainbow, and Heaven and Hell) disappointed me with their use of 5.1 surround sound, failing to offer any benefit beyond the stereo soundtracks except for some extra depth.  (In fairness, the Deep Purple and Rainbow albums were recorded in the 1970s and might even have been recorded in mono sound which would prevent any separation between instruments and singer.)    Regarding the two part \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\", a friend of mine thought that Dream Theater was going Satanic and advocating some kind of devil worship.  But if you study the lyrics (or the Korean manga \\"Priest\\" that inspired them), you'll see that this is not the case.  Instead, you'll see that the main character ultimately resists the lure of the \\"dark master\\", regaining possession of his soul.
0385340575|4.0|As someone who slammed Nothing To Lose, I found Lee Child back at the top of his game with Gone Tomorrow.  However, there is one major factual error that I was surprised to see (Mr. Child seems to do an enormous amount of research for his books). Reacher clings to the outside of a subway car leaving Union Square and then hops off and enters the train at 23rd Street. The only problem is that at Union Square, the doors open on the left (where Reacher clings to) but at 23rd Street they open on the right. So Reacher would not have been able to hop off onto the platform.
0307346617|5.0|Not without flaws but by far definitely the best zombie fiction I've ever read.    The format is very innovative also. You don't see much of this in fiction and it makes the world feel even more real.    The tale is of a pandemic and it feels like it every step of the way. You don't feel like you're getting the Hollywood version of a story where you follow 1 small group of survivors through tragedy after unbelievable tragedy where the same group just happens to narrowly escape each time. World War Z isn't a tale of a small group that made it. It's the tale of individuals who did and of a world that didn't.    There's really no plot, per se, and that's a good thing. It again gives more the feel of a genuine account instead of a plot driven novel.    There are lots of negative reviews and most of their criticisms are valid. But that didn't stop me from enjoying this book immensely!
0756405890|5.0|There isn't too much to say about Name of the Wind. It's a fantastic book written by first-time author Rothfuss.     I've read the book twice and lent it to a few friends and I've yet to find a person who wasn't just completely enthralled with the story. It's even found a home on the bookshelves of people who aren't traditionally into fantasy.    Get into this novel: it's wonderful, engrossing, and a joy to read.

B000YENUI6|5.0|Not for the squeamish, Eastern Promises paints a bleak picture of the grungy underworld of London, where Russian gangsters are involved in the most heinous acts, and even the most innocent eventually become pawns in the most dangerous game.<br /><br />When a baby is born to a very young woman Tatiana, the childbirth is too much for the mother.  After delivering the baby, midwife Anna (Naomi Watts) finds a diary written in Russian among Tatiana's possessions.  Opening the diary is tantamount to the dangers within Pandora's Box; and in Anna's case, that initial curiosity involves her in the seedy underbelly of a crime family living by the brutal code of Vory V Zakone (Translation: Thieves in law).<br /><br />Among the criminals is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortenson), a lowly, yet influential driver, whose position has allowed him the constant close proximity to both the gang's patriarch,<br />Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), and his tempermental son Kirill (Vincent Cassell).  Investigating the diary and the baby's lineage further immerses Anna into the gang's world, its crimes, and its secrets, until the movie reaches its gripping conclusion.<br /><br />Regarding the performances in this film, Viggo Mortenson is as powerful as any of his other roles.  He's as stoic as can be, and regardless of the outcome he manages to appear dangerous and sympathetic at the same time.  Speaking in Russian he's convincing and even his accent when delivering lines in English is impressive.  From top to bottom, the slicked hair, the rigid emotion, the facial structure, and the tattoos, he is a gangster.  Speaking of the tattoos, I quite enjoyed the subplot which incorporated the rich meanings and symbolism behind the Russian criminal tattoos.  Without previous knowledge, this is the type of \\"tour guide\\" information that provides enjoyable depth and intrigue, and otherwise would be easily looked over.  Each of the other characters is fully involved, and they deliver competent performances.  Watts is sympathetic, and the combination of anguish and determination on her face reflects her character's passion for newborns.  Similarly, Stahl is perfect as the crime syndicate leader.  He's one of those calm yet calculating figures who doesn't often get his hands dirty, but when he does he may as well have red skin, horns, and a pitchfork.<br /><br />My hat goes off to Director David Cronenberg for delivering one of the best films I've seen in a while.  It's truly captivating, with each character, line, and setting truly serving a purpose.  With only one underdeveloped angle - Nikolai Luzhin's secret background - there is nearly nothing superfluous.  For a script that already upped the malevolent ante, the bathhouse knife fight is a perfectly heinous coup de grace to drive the point home.  This is a great film, and comes highly recommended.combination of anguish and determination on her face reflects her character's passion for newborns.  Similarly, Stahl is perfect as the crime syndicate leader.  He's one of those calm yet calculating figures who doesn't often get his hands dirty, but when he does he may as well have red skin, horns, and a pitchfork.    My hat goes off to Director David Cronenberg for delivering one of the best films I've seen in a while.  It's truly captivating, with each character, line, and setting truly serving a purpose.

B000HWZ61Y|5.0|This is the masterpiece that Def Leppard had been working for since 1978 when they first formed the band. It's got every type of Rock song ever imagined on here. Nothing to complain about at all from this album. It's commercial sure but one of the things you can appreciate about this band is they're not sell outs. All they try to do is sell as many records to as many rock fans that will listen so they can go out and play them even better for you live (3 personal experiences myself). This album is the perfect album to prove it with. The deluxe edition is a REAL FAN thing though, I mean anyone who just wants this album for Pour Some Sugar On Me and Love Bites, or even Animal should buy the regular edition. But if you want vintage and rare Leppard...or if you're a b-sides collector...get this version. Either way GET THIS ALBUM !
B001FB4W0C|5.0|then you are missing the greatest thing to happen to network television, EVER.  I was a huge fan of buffy so when i saw that the same network was coming out with another supernatural drama i was very excited. I watched the first four or five episodes when it first came out and wasn't immediately impressed.  It seemed like they were just going to find some random evil to monotonously overcome every week with little attention to an overall story line so i stopped watching. Man was I wrong, and its rare that I'll admit that. Sometime during the third season a friend of mine convinced me i needed to be watching. Remembering that buffy didn't start out so great either i gave in and put the first two seasons on my netflix cue. Since watching the episode \\"Home\\" I have been absolutely hooked, which was ironically right where i had originally stopped watching. This was before i discovered hulu so bought each individual episode i had missed from season three from itunes. And i would do it over and over again if i had to, without regret.    I have since then bought the first three seasons on dvd and loved rewatching every episode. I can see this being something i could rewatch every couple of months or so and never get tired of it. The writing is amazing, the effects are way better than you would expect from television and you couldn't ask for better actors (Jenson Ackles is downright delicious). It really has gotten better and better with every season. I'm starting to wonder wether eric kripke sold his soul at the crossroads. I guess if he had more people would be watching.     So take my advise and buy all the seasons, watch them, then start telling your friends how much you love it. It would be a damn shame if this show didn't continue to stay on the air because not enough people gave it a chance.
0385340575|5.0|I've really enjoyed reading and listening to the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.  This one didn't disappoint me at all. Dick Hill narrates these stories and I could listen to him read forever.  If you've enjoyed the other books you'll enjoy this one.  If you haven't ever read any of these get them all and enjoy yourself.  They are fast paced, and full of adventure and easy to read.
B001W6S0C6|4.0|The film:<br /><br />Disclosure - Batman was the first movie that really knocked my socks off as a kid. I saw it several times in the theater, and it ignited a decade long love of comic books for me (that ended when I moved out on my own and didn't have the money any more). So reviewing this film is an exercise in taming my nostalgia.<br /><br />It is a very good movie. It's got some very good performances, especially Keaton and Nicholson. The story overall is strong, intertwining the origins of the two principals. It gets a bit flabby in pacing at the end, and about 10 minutes could have been cut. The ending is easily the worst bit, as Batman suddenly becomes rather homicidal, in contradiction to well-established characterization in 50 years of prior stories. Some of the effects work doesn't stand up very well today, with obvious model shots and some pretty bad animation which would now be done by CGI. Actually, what strikes me now is how \\"low budget\\" it seems at times, if you're looking for it anyway (and the vision is generally so powerful that you might not - but then I've seen this film a good 20 times).<br /><br />Overall, the fractured vision of Tim Burton and designer Anton Furst, married to a tenuous grip on reality (which was completely gone by the sequel, unfortunately), makes this compelling viewing. It's not as good perhaps as the new Nolan movies. But it's a classic. It inaugurated the boom of comic book movies that we are still enjoying/suffering through today. Kids 8 to 80 should enjoy this film. It's well worth owning as a home video.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />This video transfer is very faithful to the original film. Which is to say, it's drab, dark, monochromatic, and not at all the kind of thing you want to demo your shiny new HDTV with.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. This looks better than the previous two DVD editions. When a scene is lit reasonably well, you can see pretty good detail in hair, facial wrinkles, and wet pavement. But the overall dynamic range of the image, from dark to light, is pretty flat. This is a very dim-looking movie. The audio is a competent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 channels mix.<br /><br />Extras are comprehensive, but they are all in SD, and they are all recycled from the previous 2 disc collector's edition. There are LOADS of cast interviews, production featurettes, and one large documentary which is a 70 minute cut from the one that spanned all four \\"original\\" movies. All told I would guess there are about 3 hours of featurettes, most of which are pretty worthwhile for Batman fans. Irritatingly, most of them do not have a \\"play all\\" option. So you're forced to navigate a large menu full of small type and try to remember what you've already seen. Argh.<br /><br />Burton's commentary is very entertaining. He only trails off one or two times in the 2 hours of the film. He starts to repeat himself a bit by the last half hour, but overall it is very engaging, loaded with information, and has plenty of honest opinion from the director.<br /><br />***********<br /><br />If you own the 2 disc collector's edition on DVD, I'm not going to say this is a strong recommendation. It's just not that much of an upgrade. All of the extras are the same, and the transfer isn't one of those revelatory HD experiences.<br /><br />If you don't already own it, and you're looking to expand your comic book film collection, then definitely go ahead and pick this up.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is easily one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, movie, cartoon, or otherwise. I am not one to over dramatize; The Snowman touches a place in my heart that nothing else ever has. The film brings me to tears every time I watch it. Its innocence, fun, beauty, artistry, and grace are timeless. When I first saw it, I was in 2nd grade during the holiday season, and I was floored. Even then, I was reduced to tears by the strains of \\"Walking in the Air.\\" This sounds silly, but even now, I remember sitting in the classroom, tears rolling down my face, thinking: \\"This is so beautiful.\\" I am getting choked up now just writing about it. 20+ years later, The Snowman brings all the emotion back for me with every viewing.<br /><br />A very moving, powerful piece, I suggest that everyone (not just those with children) view The Snowman at least once in their lifetime.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Even though i could barely play the last disc and when it would play it skipped alot i can't give this show anything but five stars. Thats how awesome it is. Most of the bad reviews for season 2 were because of this problem and i feel like its a huge disservice to the show. I understand being upset about it not working but amazon has a great return policy so just return it and give the show its due credit.
159562015X|3.0|I think the book is helpful in getting me to work on my strengths, showing me how to be more confident of myself.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|My husband and I bought the regular Planet Earth series a little over a year ago and LOVED them! Recently we got a blu-ray player and decided that we definitely wanted the Planet Earth on blu-ray and bought them off amazon. They are great on blu-ray but I was extremely disappointed to find out that the Planet Earth-The Complete BBC Series (blu-ray) did not include the \\"diaries\\" section for each episode! At the end of each episode there was a \\"diaries\\" section which focused on how and what they had to do to shoot the amazing footage. It was really interesting and amazing to see what some of these people went through to bring us the great filming of Planet Earth.  We already gave away our old (non-blu-ray) series and if I was able to do it over I would have stuck with the regular series that had the diaries. The blu-ray is nice, but I did not think it that much better than the regular to be missing out on the diaries.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I read reviews before purchasing this and was pleased with what I read.  I received my dvd and started in believing I was already in decent shape from previous workouts.  Boy!  Was I wrong!  This worked up a sweat and got my heartbeat going immediately and I felt the workout for several days.  I have to be honest and say I didn't do this every day, more like 3 times a week to start.  I now find I'm comfortable with level 1 and the muscles are used to it.  Still want to stay with level 1 for a little longer before moving on to Level 2.  I'm not sure about any weight loss as I haven't stepped on the scale, but I have noticed I've firmed up more and clothes fit loosely now.  Great workout!!!
B0017YDPI2|5.0|This is the only season that i bought on bluray and i probably won't do it again.  It really just doesn't seem like the quality is that much better like it does with big budget movies. But i do absolutely love the show and will watch it over and over again.
B000005J56|5.0|I remember watching the movie PERFORMANCE in Cambridge Mass back in '69 or '70 and being enthralled with the sountrack. I, of course, went to the flick to see Mick Jagger in his first movie role. But I came out wondering how I missed what a great slide guitat player Keith Richards was, but quietly knowing that it was not he wearing the Sherry glass. Ever the researcher, I found Ry Cooder: been a fan ever since. I'm sorry but fan is just not the word. I've been stalking Ryland long before there was a word for it. Met him in the crowd at the Jazz Fest during the Ali Fakre Toure sessions, my wife catching us in the mirrors, and was actually able to talk with him - ask a couple ??? about the new band with Keltner, Lowe and Hiatt and I felt like I was in the Cat-Bird Seat. Always wondered what he was working t'wards  with all those LP's all the world music stuff and then Fate handed him his due: The Buena Vista Social Club. The musical equivalent of AA: be patient and help another drunk, or in this case another musician. He got to help and be helped. Tremendous album, music that should not be missed at any cost. Well thanks for letting me put this down. chuck
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I don't give out 5 stars very often, usually just to classics, and whether or not STAR TREK becomes a classic is yet to be determined. Yet, STAR TREK may just be one of the most entertaining, complete experiences I've had at the movie theatre in a long time. In the least, it's most likely the best summer movie of 2009 and it's certainly one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time. Loaded with intelligence, creativity, adrenaline and doesn't do what most summer movies think they have to do... ridiculous over-the-top stuff.<br /><br />You pay for the bloated egos of Hollywood everytime you fork out a 1/2 days work at the box office and you can only hope that you won't be disappointed. With STAR TREK... you won't.<br /><br />The best part about STAR TREK is that they have refurbished it, updated it, classed it up, legitamized it and all the while, the actors pay complete homage to the original stars. Chris Pine (James T. Kirk) embodies the cockiness and swagger that was perfected by William Shatner. Even his speaking style makes it completely seamless and effortless trying to make a connection with the new face of Kirk. The same goes with the entire cast, including Zach Quinto (Spock).<br /><br />I have to snicker a little bit, as an old Star Wars fan who overlooked Star Trek. George Lucas got it horribly wrong when he threw away all the models and real set locations, robbing his new films of their realism by CGing them to death and thinking that old fans would appreciate the new 'its for Kids' approach.<br /><br />J.J. Abrahms, Paramount and the entire team behind STAR TREK hit the bullseye with everything they did and they did Gene Roddenberry proud. Now, we can only hope that the way the movie unfolded, that more is to come. Were Pine & Quinto prepared to be Kirk & Spock for more than just one movie? I guess we'll see.
1400076943|4.0|First of all, if you dont know anything about some of the tenets of the Igbo peoples culture from eastern Nigeria, then missing this book will be a big loss for people who are really interested, it brings to the world the amazing intricacies of someone born and bred in a fanatically religious household, yet told with a impressive brilliance and emotion, the life of a young girl as she discovers herself amidst her father's deep religious lifestyle, yet not necessarily spiritual. Its really worth the time.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|highly recommended!!!  Start watching and I promise you'll be hooked. You don't have to be a fan of horror to love Supernatural. It has so many other aspects that make it a great show, the ghosts and demons stuff is just an extra bonus for those of us who do love the genre.
B001MS7IBS|5.0|Great
B001U0HBPG|3.0|Before I say anything, I think David Fincher is, not ONE OF, but THE best modern day director around. Unlike most directors of today, he is meticulous and strives for perfection. His images are perfect. His pre-planning and attention to detail is rivaled by only a few, including Alfred Hitchcock. While some film makers are caught up in the money pool and rush to the cinema, Fincher takes his time, chooses his projects carefully and makes darn sure that everything he does is perfect and without flaw.<br /><br />Everything above applies to THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTONS with one very important exception, at least in this reviewer's opinion. The movie is flawed in one very important way. The pacing is absolutely awful. It is a slow-moving, one-note movie that starts you off with a creative idea about a baby born with the skin of an elderly man. Then the baby becomes a short, frail, wheel-chair old man that begins to age, backward. Once that is established, the movie allows you to watch Benjamin Buttons (Brad Pitt) life unfold.<br /><br />Twice I sat down to watch it, and twice I lost interest. Eventually I decided to fast forward through the beginning part that I had already seen twice, and attempt to finish it. I figured I owed it to my favorite director.<br /><br />Everything about BENJAMIN BUTTONS, other than pacing is perfection, just as I stated before. Fincher is a master at his craft. Brad Pitt, Cate Blanchett and Taraji Henson are exceptional. The movie as a whole is a concept movie that tried to be made into a trophy winner. What it needed was somebody to realize, that it's just a movie and it needed to be trimmed and rethunk.
B00005MP58|5.0|The actors, the scenery, the script writing, the detail -- ALL of it is as rich as Austen's novels themselves.  No other versions compare.  I have two copies of the set (purchased and a gift) and have gifted this set more than a dozen times to friends who are serious J.A. fans.  It's just amazing.
0061565571|5.0|I bought this one along with the first 2 published novels. As he states, these are novels intended for a teenager public and as such are not as deep nor as complex as La sombra del viento. Character descriptions are not so developed and the book feels rushed into the closing chapters, but it's understandable because again, were written for teenagers. But yes, you can feel Zaf&oacute;n here from the first lines and for those who enjoy his writing skills as I do that's quite enough. By the way, for those of you who felt a little lost with El juego del Angel, reading his first novels will clarify some questions, as thematic resources used a lot on these works are the answer to the seemingly lost ends in that later book. All in all, very good works from the author considering the public they are intended to reach.
006135323X|4.0|Another very nice addition to the behavioral sciences. As each of the chapters gives us more proof that indeed we are not always the rational beings that economists, colleagues, and government officials claim that we are.<br /><br />As an example, in Chapter 3, we learn that the cost of zero cost is not always nil. To quote, \\"Free! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is. Why? It's because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss and the allure of Free! is tied to this fear.\\"<br /><br />So next time you are offered and accept something free, take a look at your follow-up actions a few weeks or months after you received the free item. Did it turn out to be free? All in, a very good read and comes highly recommended.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|I realize that most performers do not put out a knock-out first cd so I'm willing to give David Cook another chance whenever he decides to release his second cd.  I was looking forward to this cd because he \\"was the ROCKER who won American Idol\\"!  Uhhhh, not so much.  Every song on this cd is a semi-ballad and I really only can stand two songs; 1) Light On and 2) Come Back to Me.  \\"Come Back to Me\\" sounds like Neil Diamond to me actually and I can't imagine it doing very well.  The rest of the songs on the cd just lack....everything, actually.  If you're from Blue Springs, MO, you should buy the cd to support your hometown guy but really, for the rest of you just wait until his second cd comes out to see if it's any better.  I wouldn't buy this cd.  I did and I placed it in my cd rack and that's where it'll stay.
1439102813|5.0|The deeper into this novel I got, the more I loved it, the more I cried, the more I felt I could empathize with a person who has Alzheimer's.     Lisa Genova has written a story nothing short of spectacular. She writes with such accuracy and feeling, yet somehow is able to remain unsentimental and objective.     I really had no idea how devastating this illness was. I knew that it made you forget, and that it was a disease that cripples the mind, and eventually the body. But the reality of it really struck me hard as I watched Alice, a successful and confident Harvard professor, slowly submit to the will of this terrifying illness. The way her life changed, her family's reactions... everything was portrayed so realistically, I still have a hard time believing Alice is not a real person.     This was a really heartbreaking read for me. I haven't read something that's affected me this much in a long time. But it's in no way depressing - it's ultimately uplifting and inspirational. It makes you want to reach out. Want to value your life, your family and friends, your memories... every little thing, because forgetting is such a monster.     Absolutely loved this book. Don't miss out on it!
0060751967|5.0|This was one of the others that I purchased after reading one of her other books. It like the first, was exceptional. I love it as well.
0307460444|4.0|I tried the banana cupcakes with caramel buttercream frosting and absolutely loved it.  My friends and kids loved it too.  One friend even told me that she loved the frosting so much that she was still thinking about it the next day!  I have been searching for a buttercream frosting that is not too sweet, and I really like the swiss meringue buttercream.  It came out perfect, not too sweet and even my seven year old loved it!
0307278255|4.0|I suppose I was expecting a little more from Lahiri with this book.  I really only enjoyed the first story.  She does a wonderful job explaining feelings and matters of the heart, and her physical descriptions are fairly vivid also.  I think that maybe it was the sadness of the some of the other stories, the feelings of betrayal, that made me unhappy.  It's certainly worth a read, I was just expecting more.
1400032717|4.0|Well, I had to read this for a final in AP PSYCHOLOGY. I would have to say I liked it because it was an easy read and definitely not a traditional novel. A great story really about a curious boy.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have not opened it, but don't need to. I watched all of the shows in season one. I am patiently waiting for June 14th to get her for season two to start. Excellent purchase.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This is a great adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  It is about a girl from our time who changes places with Elizabeth Bennett.  At first she tries to keep the story going but in the end the story takes her over.  As a huge Austen fan, I loved this movie.  I thought it was a clever and fresh take on a story that many people try to remake.
B001TODCII|1.0|\\"Taken\\" is so lackadaisical in laying out its backstory---Liam Neeson is a retired CIA heavy, his wife has left him for a richer, wussier man, and his daughter chafes at his overprotective ways---that by the time the daughter is kidnapped you're rooting for the baddies to take her already just to get things underway.  The pace picks up once they do, and you get something like your money's worth as Neesom jets off to Paris and sets about gunning down a small army of oily Albanian white slavers.  With its implacably violent avenging father in foreign country premise, the rest of the movie plays out like a really stupid version of \\"The Limey\\".  However, the bad guys are so cartoonishly bad, and Neesom's craggy-faced James Bond so dully invulnerable, that the movie has no sense of danger to gin up the righteousness it needs.  It's just a grind until eighty minutes later (Spolier Alert!) Neesom gets his daughter back.<br /><br />No vigilante movie worth its salt should let you get away without feeling morally compromised.  \\"Dirty Harry\\" is brilliant precisely because it sticks a toe over the line into fascism.  \\"Taken\\" made me feel queasy too, but not because I was empathizing with Neesom's paternal killing machine.  He's a resentful hang-dog divorcee so overprotective that he thinks that flying to Paris is asking for it, whose love for his daughter is all bound up with a need to infantilize and control her, all of that laid over a core of suppressed ultra-violence.  The real thriller is a movie about what this guy would be like in real life.

B000002MFE|5.0|This is like record but way smaller and some guy sings on it. Not sure who it is though
B001TODCII|4.0|This movie was GREAT, I watched it with my girlfriend and my 2 female roommates and everyone in the room was captivated by this one. Despite the somewhat slow start and sketchy backstory it is a must see by anyone who likes action, tough guys, action, drama, or action. But don't get me wrong, the action isn't overdone, there is just enough. The best scene in my opinion is the dinner scene when the main character surprises everyone with an awesomely pimp method of getting info from the bad guy, you'll see! Now the only downside is the weak story of the pop star that only surfaces in the beginning and the end, the simulated Fergie character was cheesy but in no way should reflect the amazingness of this movie!
0385341008|5.0|THis book is a very enjoyable one to read with a rather unique (though of course not unheard of) method of letters to help convey the stroy and I had not read one recently done like that so it was special once again.<br /><br />Set during the second World War the book centers around a Londoner, Juliet who is a newspaper writer, who begins to correspond with some residents of Guernsey, and stikes up relationships with them.<br /><br />Later one she makes it to the Island and we learn more through letters.  Very well done and how the letter writers come across differently was also a great vehicle in learning about them and their charactor development.
B000000OR9|3.0|\\"The Valley of the Kings\\" is the gotta-have-it hit here, but it's really a pretty decent album from start to finish.  I'm just not all that kean on the '80's generally, nor hair bands.
006074748X|5.0|I'm one of those people who fell in love with horses as a child and never got over it.  Since I don't have one, I have to get my fill in other ways. I first read Airs About the Ground about 25 years ago.  Almost immediately, it became one of my favorite books.<br /><br />However, don't let the fact that I'm a horsey person keep you from reading this book.  Like most Mary Stewart books, it has fully fleshed-out characters that you can like, a good mystery, romance, and a satisfying ending.  It's a fast read, and good for curling up with after a long day, and forget about what the boss said today.<br /><br />And the Lippizans?  Read the book.
B002ASVYWS|5.0|I have been a devoted music listener for many years now. I explored almost every musical genre that exists and listened to dozens and dozens of albums from all over the world. Over time, I encountered some really great albums from some really great bands, albums that changed everything I knew (or thought I knew) about music, each one expanding my musical horizons and raising the bar a little bit (or a lot) higher.   Tool, Riverside, A Perfect Circle, Demians, Dredg, Pain of Salvation, Kino, Katatonia, Moving Atlas and Porcupine Tree are some examples that come to mind when thinking of progressive rock/metal greatness...     I am telling you all of this so you'll have the right perspective when reading the following statement:     I cannot recall an album as perfect and as ground breaking as \\"Sound Awake\\".     Andrew Goddard and friends have managed to compose an album that is beyond the boundries of the known musical universe and is original, melodic, challenging, epic, multi-dimensional, mature and perfectly executed and produced.     To say that there is no weak song on the album, that it plays by its' own rules or that it is a journey through soundscapes, emotions and rhythms would be a huge understatement just as the five stars rating is.     Thanks Karnivool for this beautiful album. I can't imagine how you (or anyone else) would be able to top this one, but will be happy to find out...
0596522347|5.0|This book is a comprehensive resource for those who live and die by the creating high impact presentations. I have been looking for this type of one-stop guide for presentations for a long time... well done.
B001R4MEYS|5.0|This album has inspired me to write my first amazon review. Mastodon really outdid themselves with this one. I love the harmonies and the fact that different members of the band sing different parts of the songs. The music is also very complex. The Czar and The Last Baron are epic songs and never get boring inspite of how long they are. This is also an album that has grown on me. Everytime I listen to it, I find more and more that I like. Highly recommended.
B001W63DXC|5.0|When I first saw, some time ago, that Maiden was about to put out yet another live album, I sighed.  I'll admit, I didn't think too highly of \\"A Matter of Life and Death,\\" but hey -- it's Maiden!  They put on one of the best live shows in music.  Then, when I saw the track listing, they right eyebrow came up and \\"Hmmm\\" escaped my lips.<br /><br />Anybody who has never seen Maiden live and can only enjoy them through the generous live discs throughout the years have had to suffer through one constant: the usual heavy taste from \\"The latest album.\\"<br /><br />Not so here!  Apart from \\"Fear of the Dark,\\" everything on Flight 666 comes from the so-called \\"Classic\\" age.  All the greats are here (as you can see from the convenient Amazon.com listing), and they sound just as fresh and invigorating as they first did.<br /><br />Bruce's vocals haven't lost their touch since he rejoined the band, and the fellas put as much little fills and energetic galloping beats as any 20-year old axe-slinger.  It amazes me how Nicko can keep thumping away at such a speed for a bloke his age.  They haven't had to slow down to adjust to their age or for any idiotic commercial pandering.<br /><br />Maybe it was the stereo upon which I listened to it, but Flight 666 sounds raw in the sense of loud, mean, arena-blasting rock.  There's nary a missed note or beat but it just sounds...meaty.  I mean, they actually sound excited to play the songs they've done countless times.<br /><br />God bless Iron Maiden for never being stricken by the disease of overbearing egotism that makes one abandon their earlier hits in favor of \\"more mature and artistic offerings.\\"  Maiden knows what we wanna hear, and they like hearing it as much as we do.<br /><br />Go out and buy Flight 666 and crank it up!
B001U7FWM8|5.0|Personal and expansive, layered and clearly focused, symphonic and unabashed. You will love Veckatimest and the 12 clear, masterfully orchestrated tracks it has to offer. If you've been following Grizzly Bear for some years now, this album is a must. If you are new to them, let me tell you that this CD will be a gateway into the other projects (Department of Eagles, EP releases, entire discography, etc) that Grizzly Bear and its members have been a part of. Unconvinced? Check out \\"Two Weeks,\\" their single off Veckatimest, on YouTube. Once you get the album, take a listen to \\"While You Wait for the Others,\\" \\"Foreground,\\" and \\"Cheerleader.\\"    I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do.
B00127RAJY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]<br /><br />Jillian is AWESOME.She doesn't mess around.This is old school pushups, situps, bicycle crunches, plank pose with some tricep kick-backs, lunges.... it goes on and on. And that's not even the cardio section, she has you doing jumping jacks, her famous \\"butt kicks\\", and punching in place. Jillian, thank you for creating something that really makes you FEEL stronger when you're done. I know I can reach my fitness goals with this as part of my overall weight loss plan.
B001RIY49C|3.0|Just wanted to warn anyone looking to purchase that the user images that show up in the 2nd and 4th spot are not this endoskull. The other pictures are accurate. The pictures mentioned are the Endoskull made by Sideshow Collectibles, which cost $500 and are usually sold out. There's a big difference if you look closely, and the plate beneath the skull with the writing says T2 in big letters on the Sideshow skull, while the endoskull in this set just reads Terminator 2 Judgement Day. It's not that bad looking for the cost, but it's far from Sideshow's version. I just don't want anyone to get scammed into thinking this is much better than it is.
B001EO748M|5.0|This series is a special favorite of mine--I can't get enough of it.  I also gave the first 2 season DVD sets to my sister who doesn't get Showtime and is as great a Tudor fan as I am.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|This DVD is not for everyone. If you have read James Lee Burke's novel \\"In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead\\" you will probably like it very much but if you haven't you will be lost very quickly. The film presumes you are familiar with the story and does a fine job of reproducing the tale even with the distinctive streak of white hair missing from Tommy Lee Jones' scalp.
B00164KYV4|2.0|Okay, I'm a girl.  I like chick flicks.  This is NOT a chick flick because you are frustrated, annoyed, & generally pissed off at how stupid, whiny, clingy, delusional, neurotic, etc all the female leads are (except Jennifer Aniston's character, which was thankfully wonderful).  Are there women out there that DO these things?!  If you are a man, you might have no problem with this movie because Hey, it portrays women pretty accurately, right?  If you are a woman (okay, a strong, intelligent, liberated woman) you will NOT like this movie overall.  Yes, there are cute performances but the script made for some serious \\"what the f***\\" moments. Just be forewarned...this is not a romantic comedy so do not expect one.
B000068OCS|3.0|I know this discussion and these comments are years old, but since I just discovered this ...    While I do not doubt that Mr. Beirne is correct that the theatrical version is what the director intended, I found this site's comparison of the DVDs to be very enlightening:[...]    The most disheartening part is the clearly inferior sampling rate of the MGM DVD release compared to the original IRE DVD. The clarity in the IRE images, compared to the MGM images, is startling. Also, seeing both aspect ratios directly compared, it seems obvious to me that the images were very much composed with 1:1.33 in mind, if not exclusively for it.    Personally, I think the composition of the images in that ratio are superior, but the poor sampling rate of the widescreen version makes it hard to make a fair comparison.    rd
B00005JNS0|5.0|my two year old son looooves this movie! we have to watch it everyday at least once, i'm starting to even quote it!
B00192IV0O|4.0|I love this album! It has alot of upbeat infectious dance songs that make you turn up the volume on your stereo! My favorite tracks are boom boom pow, rock your body, meet me halfway, imma be, i gotta feeling, party all the time, ring a ling, showdown and missing you. I think this album is better than their last album MONKEY BUSINESS. I don't know why people are hating this album! So upbeat dance music with catchy lyrics is automatically horrible?! A few ok tracks towards the end doesn't make this album horrible at all! Most albums have those few ok tracks. So what?! You go make an album and see how that works out! Anyways,if you are a BEP fan or not, buy the album, but beware it is very different than Monkey Business. It is in a very good way though! I love the direction the BEP is going!It is a very fun album and definitely going to be a awesome album to be seen live! I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS TOUR!
B001V9LRV0|4.0|Woodstock, the 40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition is an wonderful box but far from perfect.  If you have the 1994 Director's Cut you already have the meat of this box set.  The extra songs are great (really!) but only worth paying for if you're itching for any new footage.  Of course, if you don't already have a version of the Woodstock concert on DVD, then by all means get this box.  The extra DVD contains three songs from the Creedence Clearwater Revival set which is fantastic to finally see (along with extra songs from another dozen groups).  And PLEASE buy if from Amazon as they include their own exclusive DVD with a few very rare songs (limited time).  The Life magazine reprint is fun but I would have preferred they replaced most of the \\"stuff\\" with another DVD.  My personal peeve is the absence of Melanie.  Even it you get this box set, it will still be worth the money to buy the 2 DVD set of +Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock+ and (if you still have a VHS player that works) its also worth seeking out the VHS tape from 1991 titled, +Woodstock: The Lost Performances+ which contains a hour of songs that are not in the new box set.  The extra songs in the new box set are not integrated into the Movie, so you will have to change DVD's to see all the songs of a particular group.  Perhaps when the 50th Anniversary rolls around we will finally get a box that puts all the performance footage together as it ought to be.  If not, maybe we can have our Cryogenically frozen heads defrosted in time for the 100th Anniversary (don't count on it).  Oh, as to the complaints of others about the songs being \\"corrected\\", just ignore them, the sound is great.
0679746323|5.0|The \\"biased\\" parts are quite easy to spot, though, and more avoiding that that at the bottom of this review. The \\"deserved\\" description refers to the fact that we are long overdue for a good de-romanticizing of Mao Zedong. Even the usual right wing writers have managed to romanticize the man badly through the decades, by demonizing him to the point of implying superhuman abilities and powers. Instead, the authors demonstrate that Mao was an unusually well-read thug, and a lucky one at that.<br /><br />Briefly, the themes run like this. In his early life, Mao had written (and apparently spoken often) about how a man's \\"impulses\\" (as opposed to thoughts, ethics, character) were his most important personal feature, and these must be acted on with drive and single mindedness, regardless of the effect on persons and organizations around him. In early-middle adulthood he discovered both his love of, and the effectiveness of, torture and terror in gaining his way. Still later he developed his ability to \\"read\\" the people around him and evaluate which ones he could play off against which others. All this came to full fruit in mature adulthood (if one could say that he was capable of such) when he was able to combine all these detestable learned abilities.<br /><br />The reader will be treated to many instances where romantic legend about Mao Zedong gets solidly debunked. E.g., the so-named \\"long march\\" (from dangerous territory near the Chiang Kai Chek and the Nationalist army, to the safety of the \\"yellow uplands\\" where he fully developed the communist cadre and army) was not a series of narrow escapes for the communist troops, but rather a cynical march of twists and turns to finally emerge at the head of the army; it turns out that Chiang was not trying to destroy Mao, but rather to herd him into the mountains - on orders from Moscow! Also, the reader will be surprised, but then understand, that Mao alone (along with Kim Il Sung of N. Korea) was responsible for the start, and the very long duration of the Korean War. There are many more surprises.<br /><br />A problem with the thread of this book could be that it has a mildly jagged chronology. It doesn't skip around the years, but the chapters sometimes backtrack, although the authors do state the time span which each chapter will take up. As mentioned, the bias in this book is easy to spot, and thus disregard. Every time the authors do not use numbers to limit a bad-mouth description, or if they \\"suppose\\" that something happened around an event, they are likely not sure of their research. Count on it. Get the book anyway, it's worth every page.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Let's put it this way, if I was stranded on a deserted island and could have only one CD for the rest of my life, \\"Sinatra at the Sands\\" would be it! I've read the other reviews and understand that many (not all, by any means) of his studio albums are artistically superior. But we need to remember that Sinatra broke in singing for live audiences, from the Rustic Cabin to the Meadowlands and everything in between. I also love hearing some of the latest releases on Rhino and other labels, of Sinatra's live radio performances - some of those airchecks are just fabulous! Sometimes studio recordings are like looking at a tiger in the zoo, or worse, like viewing a stuffed tiger in a museum! Live performances are true to life and unique, no second takes. Frank Sinatra really wails and puts his heart into these tracks - \\"Where or When\\" is a song he sang throughout his career and is almost overlooked on this album, but it is a standout. \\"Angel Eyes\\", \\"Street of Dreams\\", \\"The Shadow of Your Smile\\" are just terrific. Hearing Sinatra engage the audience and hearing their enthusiasm - I just kick back and imagine myself there!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|Product was delivered quickly as stated. Concert is a wonderful evening of music from one of the great singers of our time.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The best movie of 2008-2009 hands down...<br />The movie had it all-action, suspense, and drama.<br />One of my favorites of all time.<br />Liam Neeson was spectacular.
0321127420|5.0|From the get go this book stands out as a very solid review on the subject. Highly recommend to anyone who needs serious advise on the subject.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|When I heard a clip of the music from \\"Dr. Horrible\\" I knew I had to have it.  It evoked the \\"Once More With Feeling\\" soundtrack for me -- which I love.  Adding Neil Patrick Harris and Nate Fillion in their silliest roles ever to the Whedon score made it a truly enjoyable experience.  Keep on making musicals Joss!
0887307280|5.0|I recommend this book to every entrepreneur or small business owner I know.  It's essential for building a business.  You need to understand the roles of the technician (whoever works on the product or services), the manager (whoever manages that process), and the entrepreneur/owner (whoever is focused on building a sustainable/scalable business).    Highly recommended.
B002866UOE|4.0|If you really want this exclusion edition, go buy it at target for only $9.99. $44? are you kidding me?
032147404X|5.0|If you're new to photography, digital SLRs, or coming back to photography after some time off, this is a great series of books.  Get both of them.  The format is simple and there are lots of examples.  It's very practical and down to earth.  Highly recommended.
B002BPQ0Y2|5.0|New Releases are about expectations. Everybody is reacting to this record differently because of what they were expecting. For me its the first record I have heard that responds to these gloomy times, and the message is get out of it- have fun and live!<br />B.E.P. pushed it, with their lyrics, music and message. Give em credit, its fresh- lots of energy and the great songwriting is there. I think if they had done something like their old records, we would have said it was formula. Its a great record, lots of really great tracks. Buy it.
1400064287|5.0|This is an easy read.  Anyone involved in sales, communicating, influencing, etc. should read this book.  There are some great, simple examples of how to make your ideas stick.  Highly recommended.
B002BI4Y06|5.0|Great music by a great band, I have all their albums from the beginning. But don't buy this download!<br /><br />All of the other options: the DVD ($11.99)the double CD ($12.99) and the BlueRay ($14.99, preorder) are cheaper than this download. This is ridiculous, an insult!
B0019MLVEM|5.0|I saw The Script live W/Adelle as a Mother's day gift in Philly at the Electric Factory! I already adored Adelle. The Script's sound was amazing and the lyrics touched me in major ways. This is a very talented group of musicians. Easy listen, funk, rock, r&b,a little country vibe.  Most excellent!!!
B000H5TVJY|3.0|I won't review the movie itself here except to say that it's great for all the reasons people praised it.  If you're looking to buy this Blu-ray, you've probably seen the movie anyway.    This is a very shoddy Blu-ray release.  The transfer is ugly.  It looks like an upconverted DVD.  In fact, if you have an upconvert DVD player with an HDMI cable, I wouldn't even bother replacing your old DVD copy.  The blacks are often not black enough, the colors not crisp enough.  There is noticeable grain and a lack of clarity we expect from blu-rays.    This is a great movie but it deserves a better blu-ray than this, as it is ordinarily a beautifully shot film.      I gave it three stars, because it is a great movie and for $10, this is a good starter for a budding Blu-ray collection.  Just don't expect to get the most out of your HD system with this.  Many older films (Deliverance, Face/Off, Batman, others) look much better.    Sean
0143113100|4.0|Many people think that what we are today is what we will be tomorrow but this book shows scientifically that this isn't necessarily true.  We are truly remarkable beings with the inner power to change our bodies, through the power of intentional positive thinking.  Read about many different real examples where the brain was damaged or sick, but then overcame what seemed to be insurmountable obstacles and changed!    When we believe we have the power to change, we will.  Also the opposite is also true because when we believe we can't change, then guess what - we can't.  As the quote goes, \\"As a man thinketh . . . he is\\" or - as we think, so we are.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Snakes and Arrows Live is one of the finest concert videos I've seen.  The sound quality is superb in both 5.1 and stereo; the video quality is very good, and looks stunning on HDTV; the shots are an excellent mix of long, mid, and closeup shots, and often highlight the musician doing the most interesting stuff; and the menus are innovative, allowing you to navigate to other tracks without leaving the video currently playing.  The song selection is also excellent, and the playing is as tight and entertaining as you would expect with Rush.     Overall, this is a phenomenal disc and a must-buy for Rush fans!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|Sex and the city has become iconic with New York City.  In a recent poll it was ranked at Number 7 for the most recognizable symbols of New York.  The combination of the energy and on-screen chemistry of the talented ladies of \\"Sex\\" has created a worldwide phenomenon.      As filming wrapped on the TV series, Sarah Jessica Parker had become a household name.  Her elegance and style have been recognized on a worldwide platform.  Elle Magazines 2007 \\"Most Fashionable Woman In The World\\", Parker has been the key to the sex franchise success.    Swirling in excitement and skepticism, the \\"Sex and The City\\" film delivers on all levels.  With a darker mood and a stronger story than any of the episodes of the series, the characters are explored on a deeper level.  Parker is naturally the films standout with her powerful heart wrenching performance as Carrie Bradshaw.      Still, all of the ladies feature standout performance.  Kim Catrall reprises her role as the sex crazed socialite Samantha Jones.  Samantha has recently turned 50 and she is hotter than ever.  Miranda is settled in her life with Steve and Brady but a storyline twist will keep you interested.  Charlotte's character is stronger in the film.   She helps to ground the girls through their challenges and complicated lives.    At series end Carrie and Big were making plans to be together.  Spring ahead 4 years and the happy couple are moving forward, but maybe not fast enough for Bradshaw.      \\"Sex\\" will tear your heart out at times but is exciting, engaging and definitely not a letdown for fans of the series.
B001W63DXC|5.0|I ron Maiden will for ever go down as doing things for their fans first. 25 Years after Live After death Maiden has compiled tremendous recordings from their Somewhere Back in Time Tour that rivals The World Slavery Tour years ago. The recordings are awesome !! Bruce Dickinson in my opinion is the best voice to ever come out of England. I put him right up there with Dio. With a three lead guitar phalanx and Steve harris being one of the most under rated bassits ever the sound quality is great. ron Maiden is still the best live band I have ever seen or heard and if you have yet to see them I suggest you do before they hang it up. Not that it looks like that will happen any time soon. They have a new album coming out I believe next year. Iron Maiden is Metal personified. Rock on Guys and God bless you !!!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this for our Simmons stroller.  It worked out great, and fits well.  Very handy!
B001C3KCSY|2.0|I've tried to listen to this CD multiple times and not once have I been able to sit through it. Not only do the songs sound the same, but the lyrics are terrible accompanied by a singer no one can understand. I bought this because a favorite alternative radio DJ of mine loves this CD so it might be for you, but I hated it. I'm usually very open minded about new bands, but in this case I drew the line at trying to get through the album five or six times. Other than \\"Sex on Fire,\\" which is the song I bought the CD for, it's really nothing special.
B002BI4Y06|5.0|This is just too much for a download, originally a week ago it was 13.99, which I would consider. This is just too damn much!!
0756405890|5.0|Add my name to the list of many who know this is a GREAT book.  I've read a lot of series such as Wheel of Time, Lost Realms, Mistborn, etc...and I have enjoyed them all.  But Patrick Rothfuss has made the only attempt so far that comes anywhere near to being as good as The Lord of the Rings.  I tell everybody who likes those books to read it...including my mom, who loved it, too!  Can't wait to read more.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The Series was great, the entire family loved it and learned so much from it.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal is one of my favorite artists, this CD is my favorite CD by Seal.  Fabulous motown sounds that I miss in today music.  Certainly a MUST buy.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|If I had never read any of the Sookie Stackhouse novels I would have given these DVD's 5 stars, but as luck would have it, I have read the Sookie Stackhouse novels and am a fan... of the original story. While I appreciate some of what they did in the TV series as necessary for adaptation, some of it was just over the top. I will admit I am interested to see where they go from here though, but will probably try not to relate the TV series to the books while watching.
0385338732|3.0|I borrowed this book from library since I loved the \\"Undomestic Goddess\\" and \\"Can you keep a secret\\". \\"Can you keep a secret\\" is outright hilarious. I was expecting a book that would be as good as those two books. I was a bit dissapointed with this book. Even though this book would definitely hold your interest till the end and has quite a few funny sequences....the ending was not that good :-( There were times I felt real sorry for the heroine.     *SPOILER*    I could not feel convinced that a person can be so driven towards career that he/she could change their usual caring/loving personality into a hard/cruel (Exact opposite) individual in a span of 3yrs. Do people really do so much about turns in their adult life unless something extreme were to happen in their life? In this case, the events were not compelling enough to drive someone to such drastic extreme.
B001W63DX2|5.0|The true kings of metal doing it better than they ever have. Amazing and wonderful and a real treat to get to see them behind the scenes. Great to learn that they're just a bunch of good guys who enjoy what they do. A must for any Maiden fan and heck, my wife enjoyed it, watched the whole thing, and she's never been a fan of metal, let alone Maiden. Get it!
B000EWD1KK|5.0|This movie is great for those of us who love to daydream. Walter Mitty is the quintessential daydreamer of all times. But his daydreaming begins to have some reality added in when he runs into Virginia Mayo. This movie is enjoyable for all ages. I loved it! And Danny Kayes wife, Sylvia Fine, wrote all the songs that he cleverly sings.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|If this concert had been recorded in the late sixties it would be rated today as one of the best classic rock live albums of all times. Clapton and Windwood are in top form trading licks and pushing each other over the limits. It is nice to hear Clapton in stripped down band that pushes his playing. This recording will definitely be considered as a key classic rock live album for many years.
B0006L16N8|2.0|X&Y is pretty dang close to being THE quintessential bland music album. The production is pretty-sounding, easy on the ears and doesn't demand attention. This is the perfect background music for people who are indifferent about music.    The songwriting for the most part falls flat. The melodies seem to be trying so hard to be something great but ultimately fail to stand out. Probably the strongest melody line on here is the one they copped from Kraftwerk. Most of the songs are forgettable or downright impossible to remember, as they mostly sound very similar. Also, the album is fairly long for how little it has to offer. There are hardly twelve songs worth of musical ideas here.       In short, X&Y is the epitome of mediocrity. The absoluteness of that mediocrity, (ironically) is what makes it both remarkable and despicable.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|this is my altime favorate book. there are so many conflicts in this book witch draws you in. i thought i knew the ending of the story untill i finished the book and was shocked by its twist ending. this book will bring you joy pain sorrow and will leave you in tears i recomend this book to anyone and everyone 7 and up(considering im only 11 aand i enjoyed the book)
B001KNUQ64|5.0|I haven't actually had a chance to listen to this on equipment that would   bring out its merits to the fullest, and there is a divergence of opinion   by informed BB aficionados about those precise merits or lack thereof, but  there does seem to be a consensus that, when played on good quality sound  systems, this is one of the best versions of the album ever released. It is similar (but supposedly better than) the \\"DCC classics\\" gold disc version, also mastered by Steve Hoffman, that was released many years ago and is now highly sought-after and sells for 75-100$.    The original '60s pressings of the vinyl album were apparently not mastered well, and the 1972 Reprise \\"Two-fer\\" version coupled with the obscure BB album \\"Carl and The Passions-So Tough\\", along with the DCC vinyl release from the early '90s, are considered to be the best sounding vinyl Pet Sounds versions out there.    Listeners (in general) say that the high vocals are brighter and clearer than ever before on CD. This may be redundant unless you're a serious fan and have adequate equipment to play it on, but it's a limited, attractive edition, sure to increase in rarity and value, and if you don't have vinyl capability or the previous DCC gold disc, it's probably well worth buying.
B00004U28G|5.0|This classic cross country car race flick takes the spirit of Smokey & the Bandit [[ASIN:B000EQHXOG Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition]]and transforms it into The Cannonball Run. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise are hilarious particularly when dealing with \\"Him\\". Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin are very funny dressed as priests racing in their Ferrari. I laughed everytime Jack Elam was on the screen as the \\"doc\\". This movie follows the same format as The Gumball Rally [[ASIN:B000E8QVBU The Gumball Rally / Cannonball Run II]]but is geared more for comedy.
0756405890|5.0|I recently reread this book and was completely reminded why I loved it so much.  Amazing fresh new insight into the world of fantasy. I found myself compelled to know more about not just one but most all of the characters, even ones that saw little page time.    The other thing that sticks out to me about this book is how much it makes you think.  Most fantasy I can read every third word and I know the story, but not this book.  Many times I would go back and read a section again just to make sure I got it all.      Patrick has this amazing way of grabbing you by the shirt and pulling you headlong into this book and not letting you go until you've read the last word.  I look forward with eager anticipation to his future work.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Soon as I finished to watch this movie on MPTV-Masterpiece, I immediately  proceeded to get my own copy. It's such a delightful and enjoyable movie. I guess a little fantasy such as enabling to enter into the core of those past times we all (Austen's lovers) once had while reading the novels. Because of this reason, I trully loved this movie and all the actors, who were so perfectly cast. My DVD-copy which I purchased from a diffrent web site than Amazon.com specifies on its backcover that it runs aprox. 3 hours. I was totally disappointed to find out that there are a several scenes missing (ex. \\"Amanda's singing [Downtown!] in front of Darcy, Bingley and Caroline Bingley\\", and \\"Amanda is scoleded by Mrs. Bennet and ordered to leave her residence\\", etc.) I'm wondering if any one can help me out to answer my inquiry: does the Amazon's DVD contain the entire movie scenes as it was broadcasted on TV Channels like (Ovation, PBS, MPTV,...), with no cuts whatsoever? I will be so thankful to get reliable information regarding this matter.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Was extremely excited that the Star Trek films were coming to Blue Ray.  Amazon had the best price around, although I was disappointed that the price dropped from 79.99 to 69.99 right after the set's official release date.  Was a little concerned about the image quality based on reviews. (Only Wrath of Kahn was fully restored).  I have to disagree with those reviews.  To me, the picture quality of the discs that I have seen so far are all the same.  I did not feel that Wrath of Kahn looked any better than Voyage Home or Undiscovered Country.  I would not hesitate to purchase this set.  Can't wait for the 'TNG' films to come to Blue Ray.
B001HN697M|5.0|This movie was by far my favorite one of the three. It might be because I more of a werewolf fan than a vampire, but I just loved. I highly recommend it.
0307266303|5.0|This is by far the best book I have read in years. While it focuses on the endurance aspect of running, the author gives history of human evolution, why we have lost the ability to run injury free and what we can do to restore our natural running ability.    This is not a \\"training book\\", but it will improve your running.
B001KVZ6ES|2.0|Eastwood, even in his old age, still has it. But he obviously needs better supporting actors/actresses around him. I'm not sure if he randomly picked these people out of a box or off the street, but c'mon.
B001TODCII|5.0|There are very few movies that surprise me, most don't live up to the hype.  Maybe that is why I loved this one.  I had no expectations.  I was blown away.  I never thought of Liam Neeson as a bad**s action character but he fit the role perfectly.  If you liked Man on Fire, I think you'll love this movie, similar feel.  Great action movie.  Its not a drama that makes you think, but it has a legitimate plot, sufficient character development, and great action.  Enjoy.
0439023483|4.0|Katniss Everdeen lives in a future dystopia, the nation of Panem, in what used to be North America. The country is divided into districts, and Katniss's district is one of the poorest, where most people are on the edge of starvation and she hunts and gathers to keep herself and her mother and younger sister fed. Each year, every district must send one boy and one girl to the Hunger Games, a brutal battle to the death which is televised nationally and serves as a way for the capital to keep its districts, once rebellious, in line. Katniss becomes the girl tribute from her district, along with Peeta Mellark, the baker's son, who once did a good deed for Katniss. In the Hunger Games, though, it's a fight for survival, and Katniss must decide where her loyalties lie.<br /><br />Collins doesn't pull her punches with Katniss's character. She's tough and smart and pretty darn ruthless: not feisty, not spunky, just ruthless. I liked how Collins avoided what could easily have been the stock romantic plot, too, of true love conquering all, and concentrated on how vastly different Katniss's and Peeta's worldviews and mindsets are. I would have liked to get to know the other tributes a little more, but Katniss was so immediately engaging (and it's in first person anyway) that I was carried along by her, and by the breakneck pace of the plot. I'm very glad I knew this was the first of a series, or I would have had issues with the ending, which does wrap up the main plot, but doesn't address Katniss's inevitable struggle with the totalitarian government. As it is, there's certainly enough closure to satisfy, and I'm eager for the next book.
1439138311|5.0|great book gave a realistic  approach  to both the culture era and location of the early 1950s,  excellant and prompt delivery. I would highly recommend both the book and Amazon to people.  5 plus stars

B001IBIQU6|3.0|I absolutely love Depeche Mode and this album \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" is a great addition, however it can be slow at times.  It definately grows on you as you listen to it more and more and I cannot wait until the live show.  Wrong, hole to feed, corrupt, come back to me, etc. Definately some great tunes to think about relationships to...
B00004XMTJ|1.0|I wouldn't have thought it was possible: Take what may be the worst successful show in the history of musical theatre, and make a DVD of it THAT'S EVEN MORE HORRIBLE!!! Every scene is the same, leaving only Andrew Lloyd Webber's derivative, pretentious score (and the wonderful costumes, of course, but they can't carry an entire show). The producers of this DVD could have saved lots of time and money by simply filming the opening scene, then posting the message: \\"Since every scene in this show is exactly like what you've just watched, this concludes the Commemorative Edition of 'Cats.' Thank you for your purchase.\\"
0756405890|5.0|Let's face it: This is the type of book you pick up and can't put back down. I finished reading this novel in less than a week after opening it due to many late-night reading sessions, and I can't say that about very many books in any genre that I've read in the past. The beginning is quite slow, but once Rothfuss introduces you to Kvothe (the protagonist), the story really picks up. I found myself constantly wanting to flip the page just to see what happens next.    Rothfuss does a great job creating character personalities without going into gory detail -- he gives you just enough to keep you connected to and care for the characters. The story itself is in the format of a flashback autobiography, where you get a first-person perspective of what it's like to be Kvothe. When the story is being told, it feels like an epic fantasy novel. When the story comes back to present-time, it feels just like people sitting around a bar chatting; as it should. The magic system is both novel and innovative, and the story itself keeps the door open to what can possibly happen next in the present-time.    There are a lot of complaints about the story not being meaty enough, but I feel that the reviewers are forgetting that this is simply the debut novel of a series which gracefully sets up what is to come from the next two books. If you're looking for a novel where boy meets world, boy saves world, the end; then you will probably want to wait until the series is completely finished before reading. If you're interested in an enjoyable read that has believable characters depicting their everyday trials and tribulations in a fantasy setting, then you really can't get better than this.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Tommy Lee (the real one) w/ grit, Steenbergen, Goodman, all w/ special moments, and showing that even in the laid back setting of the rural LA bayou evil deeds of the past will have future consequences. Watched it 2 days in a row and found finer points the second time around.
B00192IV0O|5.0|With everything else that's been going on with the members of BEP.  You would wonder if a new cd by them would ever come out.  Well its here and more than worth the wait.  It's totally different from their previous effort \\"Monkey Business\\" as it has more of an electronic/future vibe to it this time around.  With their first No. 1 song on Billboard the smash hit \\"Boom Boom Pow\\", the rest of the cd takes off from there.  With songs such as \\"Imma Be\\" which i would like to see released as an official single or \\"Alive\\".  It's unlike anything BEP has done in the past.<br /><br />Minus a couple missteps here like \\"Outta My Head\\" which i was with at all despite a few listens to it and one or two other tracks.  I'm really pleased with the \\"The E.N.D.\\" as a whole and no its not the end of Black Eyed Peas just the start of what i'm sure is going to be more success and recognition now and in the future.  The cd is fun, engaging yet touches on relevant things like on the song \\"The Now Generation\\".<br /><br />It might not be the best cd out right now but it is up there for me in terms of likability, replay value and playable songs.  More than a few of the songs here can and should be on radio and the charts in the future.  So if you can get past the title of the cd and into the cd itself.  You will find that BEP continues to grow and evolve.  This is no exception, enjoy.

B000WCN8SC|5.0|This is a review of the 5.1 Surround versions of the albums.    A couple of other reviewers have made some negative comments about the 5.1 mixes.  I have to say, I think they are pretty darn good.    To my non-engineering ears, 5.1 mixes come in two types.  There are the kinds of mixes that were done for a lot of the old Quadrophonic mixes (I still have my quad amp).  They simply mixed some ambience in the rear speakers.  In other words, the rear speakers contained things you would be expected to hear in a concert hall behind you.  The main band parts still were in the front speakers, some echo or crowd noise behind you from the rear speakers. I have some 5.1 CD's that kind of do this, minimal participation from the rear 'surround' speakers.  BOC's \\"Agents of Fortune\\" is an example.  Some guitar tracks, maybe a bit of percussion is all that you get from the rear.     There were some quad mixes that put different instruments in each track.  A good example is Deep Purple's Machine Head.  This is what most 5.1 mixes do, a separate sound track in each channel, with the voice usually from the center channel, and the bass drum and guitar from the subwoofer.  This is what the Doors 5.1 mixes do.  I really like them.  I think most of us will agree, most Doors albums did not feature a huge number of overdubs.  So, there is not that much to stick in each channel, it gets kind of stark.  But, no matter, I LIKE the feeling of being in the MIDDLE of the band, not in front of it.      Point here is that the 5.1  mixes are, to my ear, just fine, and what I paid my money for.  Along with the 5.1 DVD's are great stereo mixes on CD's, so there really is no down side.
0756405890|5.0|I don't normally review items on Amazon, but for this book, I will make an exception.  This is easily the best new fantasy book I've read in at least the last 10 years, probably more, ranging back to the first books of the Belgariad by David Eddings and of course, the master, Tolkien.    Rothfuss has created an enchanting world and a central character with depth and who you end up genuinely caring about.  I can't recommend this book enough to anyone who enjoys fantasy, and I eagerly await book 2 of the trilogy...
B001IBIQU6|2.0|No spark. That's what I felt while listening to the new Depeche Mode album for the first time. Frankly, I was about to stop the player, but I know that with DM you need to listen more than once. So that's what I did. Although not a complete disaster, I think that this is the weakest DM album to date.    The album begins with a mellow tune which sets the pace for the rest of the songs. \\"In Chains\\" begins with a distorted synths intro and then Dave Gahan's vocals pour in with the same higher pitch that he's been using in the last few albums; a decent start. \\"Hole to feed\\" goes without notice and then comes the only diamond in the rough in this album. \\"Wrong\\" sounds very strange at first listening, and is definitely not a catchy radio tune like last album's \\"Precious\\". However, after listening a few times you get the song; it is a powerful and epic anthem that will probably be a big hit in live shows.    Unfortunately this is where the story ends. After only 3 songs the albums fades away. The following songs are mellow, weak, sound quite the same, and worst thing: they sound like DM didn't really care about creating a unique album. \\"Come Back\\", \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Miles Away / The Truth Is\\" are the best songs from the album, but frankly, I don't think that DM would have included such weak songs in previous albums.    The feeling is that DM created this album as an excuse for their live tour, which I'm sure will be good (like all of their tours). The album, however, will be forgotten in the universe.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I hate comedies and I don't like movies that are inappropriate. There was a lot of sexual humor in this one. I wouldn't recommend it for kids.   But all that is beside the point. This is the most hysterical movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I laughed so hard that I cried throughout almost the entire thing. And that's saying a lot coming from me.

Oh yeah, as the title says, this book is for EVERYONE!!!
B0000042MY|5.0|The crescendos in this soundtrack are stunning and epic. The movement of stirring feminine and masculine overtures, that parallel the uncivilized warriors and genteel English women (two sisters), play off each other, like wild creatures roaming freely in the pristine wilderness of old. Bear in mind, in James Fenimore Cooper's day, the wild country was so beautiful: that pioneers, explorers, and natives would stand for hours and gaze into the majestic beauty of the untamed, untouched, unfettered calm of nature itself (a Garden of Eden, so to speak).    Captured brilliantly by the composers of this soundtrack. The sweep, grandeur, epic pitch of battle, slaughter through treachery, escape, torture, heroism: captured and encased by some of the finest motion picture overture music (ever composed); on the level of Hans Zimmer and Miklos Rozsa. Each theme, each scene, emboldened by the music; so that, by Act III, we are family to the heroes and heroines (two of whom die shortly, thereafter). Catharsis merged with the orchestration of sacrifice, death, and renewal of purpose.    There is no subdued passion in this score. You hit the ground running, like a puma, and you stay in quick stride until our two remaining warriors and our one English woman (now wild, like them) stand atop a mountain majestic and star into a valley, still preserved to this day. Proud to say my buddy, Russell Means, played his role as the warrior father with his own superb investment of character and honor. Thought this remarkable film was Best Picture that year, hands down.
B000FSME1A|5.0|When I saw this movie when it first came out, I was truly blown away. When it was over all I could do was shake my head and exhale over & over. My girlfriend at the time ask me what was wrong, when we got in the car I could not speak. This movie made me want to become a film director. When I moved to L.A.  a couple of years later I went to film school, but needless  to say that didn't happen. The opening scene is one of the best, it really set the tone for the rest of the movie. I have NEVER had that experience again. A  fantanstic movie.

0800141601|4.0|Curious attempt to tell the story of Camelot without the mysticism of Morte D'Arthur.  The movie is stripped of the story's historic magic and told as a non-supernatural event.  All-in-all it was nicely done.<br />The fault I find with this piece rests entirely on Richard Gere.  I simply cannot buy him as a heroic character and certainly not as the charismatic Lancelot.<br />On the other hand... long live Lord Connery!

B000M341QE|4.0|Martin Scorsese finally won the Oscar the whole world felt he was owed in 2006 when he made this new age crime thriller.  I have never been a huge follower of Scorsese, but I must admit that in recent years I've come to appreciate some of his finer works and have come to see him for far more than just a `gangster' movie maker.  Scorsese actually has a slick resume filled with much more than `GoodFellas' and `Casino'.  While I don't think `The Departed' is his best work (neither is `GoodFellas' or `Casino' for that matter) I can say that I understand why he finally won that directing Oscar and can actually say that his win is justified, despite the fact that sympathy played heavily in his favor.<br /><br />Now, when I sat back to finally review this film I came to a major roadblock.  One of the most rewarding things about `The Departed' is that it is so unpredictable.  Its one biggest flaw (that sloppy ending) is also the films biggest selling point (totally mind blowing in the way it just sneaks up on you) and so reviewing the plot seemed almost pointless.<br /><br />I mean, what can I say without saying too much?<br /><br />Billy Costigan is a cop being placed undercover into crime boss Costello's mob.  Colin is one of Costello's men being placed undercover into the Boston police force.  Neither knows of the other's existence yet almost simultaneously become aware of the other and begin trying to sniff the other out.<br /><br />Along the way lots of people die.<br /><br />Instead of trying to analyze the plot (which I'm sure a lot of you who have yet to see this will thank me for in the long run) I'm going to tell you why this film is worth your time.  Martin Scorsese is a master of the lens and crafts a genuinely intriguing and breakneck paced thriller that never runs too long and never loses you.  Despite everything that gets thrown your way, the film is actually very easy to follow.  It also sports one of the best ensemble casts of that particular year (forget `Little Miss Sunshine').  Everyone involved is really at the top of their game.  Leonardo DiCaprio is stellar here, truly phenomenal, and delivers what may be his finest performance to date.  He is completely aware of what makes Billy so essential to the audience, creating a likable, understandable and identifiable character who is also exciting.  Matt Damon, an actor I am not always sold on, is flawless here.  He doesn't have the same energetic draw that DiCaprio has, but he manages to make his character just as engaging.  Jack Nicholson is `Jack', plain and simple, but who better to play `Jack' than Jack?  As far as the supporting players are concerned, you have wonderfully fleshed out performances from Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Ray Winstone and Alec Baldwin; not to mention the glorious Vera Farmiga.<br /><br />Everyone is great.<br /><br />So this brings me to the films drawback; the ending.  I'm not going to divulge anything vital, I promise, but I can't not write about why I can't stand behind this film all the way.  It's a great movie, don't get me wrong.  It's exciting and interesting and engaging, but it lacks something crucial as it draws to a close.  The film just kind of falls apart very quickly.  There was so much time spent really fleshing out the films core that little to no attention was spent on fleshing out the films finale.  It just kind of...ends.  The ending appears almost thrown together haphazardly, and then the obviousness of the final shot was cringe inducing (why oh why did you do that Scorsese).  Up until the last ten minutes or so I was actually thinking this Oscar win was deserved, but there was so much more that could have and should have been done with the ending.<br /><br />It's rather sad really.<br /><br />Anyways, I cannot fault the film too much.  It succeeds in doing so much, and like I said, even though the films ending can be rendered a `flaw' it is also a HUGE selling point (you'll never see this one coming) so in the wise words of Benicio Del Toro, \\"take the good.\\"
B00192IV0O|5.0|I'm sure many, many people were a bit thrown off by 'Boom Boom Pow' when it was first released. And probably didn't like it. I was questionable about it of course, it was very different. But that's what Black Eyed Peas always do. Something different, even if they use auto-tune, they always manage to make the music different than other artists.    First when I listened to clips on Amazon, I heard quite a few curse words, and was kind of confused why it wasn't given a Parental Advisory label. (Not that I care, but as I can see, other people do.) I think in order to have one you have to say the \\"F word\\" more than once. In two of the songs, they block it out.     Anyway... it's only been out for a day and I've already got myself singing the songs randomly. They're always stuck in my head. Again, if you aren't into something different, with auto-tune, etc. This album isn't for you.      'Ring-A-Ling' is about getting calls from someone early in the morning, aka Booty Calls, but saying they aren't. When I saw the title I had no idea it was going to be about that.    This CD consists of club/dance songs, then a little bit more serious songs like 'One Tribe' and 'Now Generation' Take a listen, or a couple of listens, and decide for yourself. It's clearly not for EVERYONE.

B001V9LRV0|5.0|This 40th Anniversary collector's edition is a marvelous paean to what is arguably the greatest documentary ever made. The Warner Brother's Director's Cut in 1994 was a drastic improvement over what was already a wonderful film but their dvd version of it did not do the Director's Cut justice......until now.    This set comes with a completely remastered 1994 Director's Cut (although the tribute to the now-deceased Woodstock participants at the end of the film has not been updated) and a bunch of cool extras including a replica of a $24 woodstock ticket & a complete re-print of Life Magazine's issue on the Woodstock coverage, just to name a few things.    The film is on two separate discs with the interf'ingmission happening at the end of the first disc, just like that great ol' Director's Cut.    Also, there's a great extras dvd that has performances by bands not seen in any version of the film. They include:    The Grateful Dead - a 37 1/2 minute jam session that concludes with their speakers blowing out, replete with smoke!!    Canned Heat - you see the lead singer with the unique voice sing \\"On The Road Again\\" and Bob Hite saying to the crowd that he has to urinate (this is only heard in the film but now you get to actually SEE IT!)     Creedence Clearwater Revival - You see them play 4 songs from their Woodstock set (most famously \\"Born on the Bayou\\") and you see John Fogerty getting a little testy with the sound crew at the end of the aforementioned song. Classic stuff!    Mountain - if you've ever owned the Woodstock album, you've heard their stuff. Now you get to see them perform 2 songs (not their big hit \\"Mississippi Queen\\" because it wasn't written yet) and the gigantic fat singer (The Mountain) really belts out the tunes.    Paul Butterfield's Blues Band - again, if you've owned any Woodstock albums, you probably heard this guy (who died in 1987) but now you get to actually see him belt out some blue-eyes soul! He's not that remarkable but his back-up band is fantastic.      Johnny Winter - Yes, Mr. Albino himself! You see the master perform a great 10 minute song/guitar solo that is to die for.     Other extra footage contains other songs from the performers who appear in the film (e.g. Joan Baez, Joe Cocker, Sha-Na-Na, Jefferson Airplane, & The Who [the Abbie Hoffman-Pete Townshend confrontation is not included since no known video footage of it exists]).     The extras disc also has a memorable montage of scenes from the festival's opening and closing with inspiring commentary by the Legendary Emcee himself, Mr. Chip Monck.     Included on the extras disc are interviews with Michael Lang, Michael Wadleigh & others (even Mr. Monck!)    And you gotta love the swede fringe box! Well done Warner Brothers....you finally got the DVD right.
B000YENUI6|4.0|I figure Aragorn would come storming down out of the pinnacle of Minas Tirith if he knew Viggo Mortensen made a movie like EASTERN PROMISES.  Tolkienesque this dark film definitely is not.  Yet Mortensen definitely impressed me playing a \\"driver\\" for a Russian mob family in urban London.  From his stoic, almost inhumane demeanor, to his extremely convincing Russian accent, this actor shows some serious range.<br /><br />Translating the Russian diary of a dead young mother who just gave birth to an infant girl is the catalyst to this powerful, yet disturbing, story.  The midwife caring for the baby (Naomi Watts) is looking for answers to the mother's past; her search brings her inside the Russian mob, to a family led by a soft-spoken, yet very calculating, patriarch (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Mortensen is one of the family's enforcers, a man whose tattooed body tells the story of his life in Russian prisons--a man who must keep tabs on the patriarch's hot-tempered, hard-drinking son (Vincent Cassel is fabulous); yet as the story progresses, a special bond develops between the midwife and the enforcer.  The movie builds to a rigorous climax, and when it arrives, the gratuitous violence takes over.  (The bath house scene, where we get to see more of Viggo than we ever wanted, while grisly and brutal was still over the top.)<br /><br />EASTERN PROMISES shows us Russian culture as well as the ugliness of the mob with its cold and stark inhumanity (the young working girls are treated like chattel).  It's brutal, dark, often terrifying, yet all of it is thoroughly believable.  Not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but very entertaining and informative.  Aragorn might not approve, but I do.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B0019GO5DC|4.0|And my 80's reviews continue. Okay, watching this movie is basically like watching \\"Pretty In Pink\\" all over again, but with the genders and ending switched. Makes sense. It was written by the same writer, John Hughes, and directed by the same director, Howard Deutch(who would later marry his star, Lea Thompson). But there's more to it than that, and we will get into that a little bit later. For starters, let's get to what the movie is about. But if you have seen the already mentioned PIP, then you pretty much already know. And having just written a review for PIP, I thought it would be quite hard to review a movie that is basically the same one I just wrote about. But I will do my best!.    Eric Stoltz stars as Keith Nelson, a middle class 18 year old high school senior. He works at a garage, attends school, and has a father(John Ashton, \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\")riding his every moment to pick a college to attend. But Keith is on his own path. He has a best friend in Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson), a tomboy with a love of drums(as she carries her sticks with her wherever she goes)and for Keith. But you see, Keith is blind, and he doesn't see it. Instead, he has the hots for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), a beauty who is in a whole other class than Keith and seemingly unattainable. When she has had enough of her boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Scheffer), Amanda accepts Keith's offer of a date, and he sets out to win the girl, stand up to the bully, and continue to overlook his best pal's feelings for him.    Okay, here is how I know the story. John Hughes wrote \\"Pretty In Pink\\" with an ending he liked and wanted. The director, producers, and even Ringwald(who was offered this movie but turned it down. Why would she want to do the same movie over again?) herself, didn't like it, didn't think the audience would either, and it was changed. In my opinion, it was a change for the better. Ending it the other way just didn't ring true to me and a lot of others, and the people involved supporting the change have valid reasoning. So, John Hughes ended up writing this movie in response to how \\"Pretty In Pink\\" ended with his original ending intact. Except this time, his original ending works for the better with these characters. It really wouldn't of worked with PIP at all, and I am glad they changed it for that film. Here, it does ring true, and it works. It feels right. The way it should be. But does anything else work?.    Just like PIP, \\"Some King Of Wondeful\\" is working with a story that is not new and we've seen numerous times. But the movie has what PIP had that made it seem worthwhile. The script, and a lot of the dialogue, just works for the time and place and the characters. These people seem like real human beings, and not plastic models that you see plastered all over TV and movies nowadays. I found myself charmed by the whole thing, as with PIP, and really liked the characters. Speaking of, The characters were cast with good actors. Even though Ringwald sat this one out, we get another redhead in the form of Eric Stoltz. He does an admirable job as Keith Nelson, and he is really likeable and down to earth. There is an innocent charm to him in the same way as Ringwald's past characters in the Hughes universe. He is relatable and watchable. So too is Mary Stuart Masterson as Watts, the \\"Duckie\\" of this version. She has the right kind of attitude and punkiness for the role, and doesn't make it a caricature, which can so easily be done, and many actors would do just that with the role. Sadly, Lea Thompson(the female version of Andrew McCarthy) can't quite match the other two. She is pretty and likeable, but I got the feeling that maybe she was just the wrong choice for Amanda Jones. Some of her scenes were a little wooden, and I didn't get much chemistry with her and Keith together. Thompson is a fine actress, but she has been much better in other roles. And then there is Keith's family. John Ashton is great as the gruff dad, but it's Keith'stwo sisters, played by Maddie Corman and Candace Cameron, that steal the show. Some of the best humor in the movie comes from his family. I loved those parts. I also loved Elias Koteas as the school tough guy, whose relationship with Keith soon turns after his first introduction in the movie in a great way. His scenes with Stoltz in detention admiring each other's art work was a particular highlight. I also loved the \\"Breakfast Club\\" reference when Watts tells the guys she's playing cards with \\"you mess with the bull, you get the horns\\". The line the principal gave to Bender.    I really liked and enjoyed this movie a lot, and even though there is a part of me that wants to write a less than rave review, or at least, a smaller four star rating, simply because we've just seen this movie a year before, I just can't. I liked it too much and it was just very enjoyable. No matter if we've seen this story before, this movie still manages to get you with it's real, normal, characters, the well casted actors they have assembled for the movie, and the surroundings. No matter what decade, we've all been to high school. John Hughes always knows how to cast a movie too. His casts are usually great. As for the ending, it's the feel good ending that a lot of people would want, and here, it's what should happen. I just don't think I would feel the same if PIP had ended the same way. Plus, if it did, then we probably wouldn't of gotten this movie. And did you catch a Rolling Stones theme throughout the movie. Amanda Jones is a Stones song, one that is heard throughout the film. The main kid, Keith, is named after Keith Richards. And Watts?. You guessed it. Stones drummer, Charlie Watts. Love it. So, \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" is PIP 2, but that's okay. It's also one of, if not the last, great teen/high school movies of the 80's, and John Hughes' last as well. The 80's was just perfect, and it surprises me how people still have to point out, as a negative, that these movies are dated. Well, of course they are. And the point being?. They weren't made yesterday. Nowadays, something only a month old is dated and people are on to the next thing. The great thing about these movies is that not only is it's \\"dated-ness\\" a good thing, a fun nostalgic thing, but these movies have things that people can see and go \\"Oh!, remember that!\\". Some of these things may not be what someone wants to remember, but they are memorable. 20 years from now, it's not going to be the same looking back at movies from the 90's or present day. I guess it means more to those who actually grew up in the time and understand what it had to offer much better. Also, these kinds of movies have issues that are universal to everyone. Hughes was a master at this genre. Nobody did it better than him. If \\"Some Kind Of Wonderful\\" was to be his teen swan song, it wasn't a bad way to go.    This edition is the \\"I Love The 80's\\" version, and there are no special features, but you get the exact same CD with the exact same 4 songs that are in the other editions. While this is cool, it would of been nice if it were a different CD in each one. I mean, does anyone really need numerous copies of A-Ha's \\"Take On Me\\"?. I think not.

B001R60ESE|4.0|What if you took stars from several generations (John Mayer to Steven Tyler) and musical genre (YoYo Ma to Sting)and had them perform mostly standards with an established jazz quintet (Botti and his very talented band of Billy Childs, Robert Hurst, Billy Kilson and guitarist Mark Whitfield) and the Boston Pops Orchestra. Here, you get demo quality video and audio recorded in a beautiful venue before a well-healed, courteous and appreciative audience.     I have never seen so much talent do so little to excite and inspire. For those of you old enough to remember, this is an Ed-Sullivan-Show-like revue without the comedian and the circus act. Nothing wrong here, especially if you know what your getting. But this musical landscape is painted by Turner not Van Gogh.     The disc is at its best with Botti and his band playing. They are outstanding individually and collectively. And there are several guest combos that work well including Botti with Yo Yo Ma, Botti and Whitfield with Katharine McPhee and, most especially, Botti with violinist Lucia Micarelli. Micarelli's performance--and costume--infuse much needed passion to some, otherwise, staid performances. And interestingly, it is Tyler's rendition of the Aerosmith anthem Cryin' that (finally) brings the crowd off their seats.     I recommend that you try to rent or borrow this disc before you buy. Decide for yourself whether it is one that you will want for repeated playback. ****
B00062NEA0|5.0|When this movie first came out on VHS way back when, I was very excited because I was one of the many who stood in line at the theater when the movie fist came out. I was totally disappointed after viewing the original version of the VHS tape because there were key scenes in the movie that were cut from the video release. Then I found out that there was a \\"special longer version\\" of the movie. I ended up buying that version on laserdisc and it was the exact movie that I had remembered seeing in the theater.     This VHS tape listed here is that \\"special longer version\\". I highly recommended it, although most people prefer \\"The Wrath Of Khan\\", this film is a very good one too.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Let's 'about' face it, David Gilmour's strong suit as a musician and composer is wholly around his neck. Few axemen in Rock have the rich, bluesy, and exquisite tone of Gilmour. And unlike so many, he also knows when *not* to play notes in a given song; this sort of musical self-awareness in Rock is very rare in my humble opinion.    Unfortunately, lyrics have never been Gilmour's strong suit---and his wife Polly simply isn't a great lyricist either. At best the lyrics here are pusillanimously pleasant if forgettable, at worst they are simply bad poetry---trite and occasionally cringe worthy.    My suggestion to Mr. Gilmour is that he return to his roots a bit (give a listen to the opening bars of Wish You Were Here again, for example) and for his next effort, lay down a completely stripped-down instrumental blues-based prog-rock fusion album. It's through the Strat that he best expresses himself. Gilmour could evoke killer tone from playing \\"She'll Be Comin' 'Round The Mountain\\" on a Mickey Mouse guitar, for god's sake---his playing is so soulful and rarefied that lyrics usually just get in the way.      Plug in, toss the lyrics sheet, and let your guitar speak for you, Mr. Gilmour.
0307388921|5.0|This was my introduction to Chuck Palahmiuk in print form (I'd seen Fight Club just like the rest of the free world).  Even the small characters were interesting in this great story.  I'm adding all of his books to my wish list.
B00192IV0O|2.0|When Kanye embraced Auto-tune in [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]] at least he had the plausible reason of wanting to quickly generate an album that allowed him to express his pain and anguish over the loss of his mother. And while the album he produced ended up being less than my favorite, it had an urgency and integrity to it that allowed me to overlook what has become the crutch of every band hoping for top 40 hits: the auto-tune monster.<br /><br />Weather or not you like or dislike auto tune isn't the real question though; it's more of a symptom of a general regression towards unoriginal, frustratingly interchangeable albums and tracks as even bands known for fun, intense, original sounds (like BEP) opt for cheap commercial success and smash hits over artistic endeavor and well earned accolades. It's the musical equivalent of Hollywood, busy churning out sequels to movies that weren't good in the first place (and many of them terrible! Garfield 2 for example). In the mad rush for the top of the charts, it seems anyone, including the vaunted Black Eyed Peas, will succumb to dumbed-down pop-hop complete with it's mandatory dose of auto-tune wizardry of the wizard behind the curtain Oz variety.<br /><br />Is this an awful album? Not necessarily. It is not, however, filled with the sort of soul and artistic hip-hop fun of their last two albums. It's more of a summer-bash/club scene album that I'm sure will spin off hundreds of remixes of all shapes and sizes. More techno than anything, it will not have the staying power or legacy of a power album. 10 years from now no one will be looking back and commenting on the impact of this album, except possibly to bemoan the END of the massive potential of BEP.
B00013F38K|5.0|In the basement of my parents house on a Thursday night in 1972 I was flipping through TV channels when I a sunburst appeared on the screen, and some vaguely Oriental sounding music boomed out of the TV, and a far off figure of a man trudged across the sand dune in a desert. I watched the pilot episode of Kung-Fu, and the mixture of fighting and philosophy was food for an 11 year old seeker.<br /><br />Kung-Fu is the story of how a Shaolin priest comes to be in the post-Civil War American west. David Carradine plays Kwai Chang Caine who is the son of an American and a Chinese woman. Both die leaving the young Caine to be taken in by the Shaolin monks who raise the young boy teaching him the ways of the mind and body, philosophy and fighting. On the way to a celebration with one of his masters the adult Caine kills the nephew of the Emperor (after he kills the master). Caine then flees China for America not only to flee the death sentence he received in China but also a search to find his one living brother Daniel Caine. This search takes him through the American west where he finds American culture and customs as exotic as they find him. As cultures clash Caine and prejudices flourish Caine finds himself calling upon all the lessons taught him by his Shaolin teachers not in only in living a just life, through the extensive use of flashbacks we witness the training the young Caine undergoes and how the philosophy relates to the circumstnaces Caine finds himself in.<br /><br />I got this collection when it first came out and I sat watching all the episodes reliving the nostalgia of being in that basement again. I was amazed at the quality of the shows they look as good (or better) as they did when they first aired on TV. The story lines also held up, they tried for the universal in the themes, for instance the episode \\"Chains\\" is a variation on the movie The Defiant Ones. And the show is also laced with special guest stars including Jodie Foster, John Carradine (star David Carradine's father), Dana Elcar, Albert Salmi and a host of others that if you watched TV in the 70's you'll recognize. With the recent death of David Carradine I once again took the DVD's out and watched the episodes and discovered that this show and it's star played an influential role in my life, and they still have the power to influence, if you let them.s father), Dana Elcar, Albert Salmi and a host of others that if you watched TV in the 70's you'll recognize.

B000RPTQ1C|1.0|What a load of garbage.  The singer and guitarist obviously worked hard to copy Bono and The Edge.  And while they did a good job of copying, it's really sad they win an award for copying.  Unless Coldplay is just a band U2 created to be a back up band in case either Bono or the Edge get sick and need a temporary replacement.  If that wasn't true, then the singer for Coldplay should have realized somewhere along the way, \\"Hey I sound precisely like Bono, but darnit I can't come up with something original!\\"    Coldplay is a joke band to be enjoyed by people with poor musical taste.

B001SO69IY|5.0|I'm having a hard time coming up with something substantial to say, but, this album is really, really good. Awesome beats, awesome verses from everyone... I was really looking forward to this, because somehow I knew it would be good. I think when Meth and Red come together, being from different camps and both being big solo stars, they know they have to show and prove, and they do it. This is an excellent album.    To my Wu heads: I'm a big Method Man fan, and I have to admit that Meth hasn't always lived up to his potential (although I don't think he's ever released anything whack). But here, he is seriously amazing. So if you're a Meth fan and you've been disappointed by him before, you have to check this album out. Listen to the track \\"Hey Zulu\\" if you're skeptical.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Considering this is Avenged Sevenfold's breakthrough album, there must be a good reason for it. In a decade where so-called metal bands compose four-minute songs of formulaic, downtuned and overly-melodic riffs, harsh yelling and repetitive breakdowns, Avenged Sevenfold brings something new to the table with \\"City of Evil\\".    This album shows them progressing with their sound. \\"Sounding The Seventh Trumpet\\" was their fastest and rawest, but their least-professional sounding and you could tell they were younger when they wrote it. \\"Waking The Fallen\\" showed much better songwriting and a bigger, more epic sound, bringing guitar solos into the mix (including great ones such as in \\"Eternal Rest\\" or \\"Second Heartbeat\\").    Now comes \\"City of Evil\\". What sound is presented here, you may ask? Well, \\"City of Evil\\" sounds pretty similar to \\"Waking The Fallen\\", however, on this album that is far less screaming, the tempos are slowed down a little, there are more intricate riffs, an even more epic sound and many more guitar solos. So the speed and screaming of some of the stuff on \\"Waking The Fallen\\" HAS vanished, but with \\"City of Evil\\", Avenged Sevenfold added some amazing, new elements to their sound. Here are the highlights of the album:    \\"Beast and the Harlot\\": A modern classic that starts off slow, featuring a piano and a complex 9/8 time signature. The song picks up with a great guitar riff, then explodes with the same riff played one octave lower, so it gets much heavier. A melodic, sing-a-long chorus and an amazing guitar solo, one of the greatest around, are also featured, along with an intense bridge towards the end that goes back into the chorus. What a classic!  \\"Burn It Down\\": A faster, even more intense song with heavier, rawer riffs and a blistering, dual-guitar melody in the beginning. Another melodic, sing-a-long chorus is featured here.  \\"Bat Country\\": Fast, punk-ish riffs, a blazing guitar solo, amazing guitar duals and a catchy chorus are featured here.The verses are also intense, and a soft section kicks in every now and again, making for some great tension and release. That makes the song even more interesting, AND even more professional. By the way, this song was also written about the Johnny Depp cult film \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". I highly recommend you watch that movie!  \\"Trashed and Scattered\\": One of my favorite guitar intros on the album kicks this song off, before going into blazing speeds, blistering shred solos and a catchy, shout-a-long chorus. Just an overall incredible song!  \\"Seize The Day\\": A beautiful, piano-driven ballad with some jaw-dropping guitar work, not to mention some heart-melting verses and choruses. One of the best, metal ballads of recent years.  \\"Strength of the World\\": The longest song on the album, this is a Middle-Eastern tinged headbanger with heavy riffs and an awesome, shout-a-long chorus.    So while much of the screaming and metronome-pushing tempos of \\"Waking The Fallen\\" have vanished, the scales are evenly balanced with all that was gained with this album. It's a modern classic that can be listened to over and over again, I know I've done that. But for those that still haven't heard this, check it out NOW!!! Thanks for the time, and peace.
0756405890|4.0|This review was originally written in 2007 before the book was published and the attendant wave of hype:    The Name of the Wind is the debut novel by American author Patrick Rothfuss. It is the first volume in The Kingkiller Chronicles and has arrived on the back of an immense amount of pre-release publicity, comparable to that which accompanied the release of Scott Lynch's The Lies of Locke Lamora last year. It is also an accomplished book which I greatly enjoyed reading.    The Name of the Wind is really two stories told in parallel. In the present-day tale we meet 'Kote', an innocuous barman running a nice inn in the middle of nowhere. However, his ability to single-handedly take on an infestation of spider-like demons soon hints that he is more than he seems. The arrival of 'Chronicler', a man searching for a legend, soon reveals the truth to us: that our flame-haired innkeeper is really Kvothe, a warrior and spellcaster of powerful repute. The bulk of the novel then proceeds in flashback as Kvothe tells his life story to Chronicler.    There is nothing particularly new in this story. Kvothe is born amongst a travelling people and lives the bucolic dream until events take an unexpected turn etc. He then grows up learning various skills and eventually becomes an apprentice spellcaster at the great Commonwealth University, where things threaten to go a bit Harry Potter-shaped (although Rothfuss on his first novel is already a far more accomplished writer than Rowling after six) for a few chapters until Rothfuss takes the story in a more compelling direction.    What is unusual and somewhat refreshing about the story is its relaxed feel. There are moments of high drama, of confrontations and skirmishes and terror, and Rothfuss handles all of these with the skill of a seasoned writer, but for the most part the story is allowed to unfold at its own pace. Rothfuss' writing is quite rich and draws you into its smokey taverns, its music halls and wild windswept bluffswith ease, a far cry from the furious pace some othe recent fantasy stories have unfolded. In fact, when the novel comes to an end it's a slight surprise that it's not with a bang, but a simple pause before Kvothe unveils the second part of his life story.    The reason for this is that The Kingkiller Chronicle is actually one huge single novel that was broken in three for publication, and no attempt has really been made to make the individual parts stand alone. Those used to the 'standalone novel which is simultaneously part of a larger story' approach recently favoured by Scott Lynch or Steven Erikson may find this move slightly frustrating, as the second part of the trilogy is still a year away from publication.    Another flaw in the novel is that Rothfuss gives occasional winks to the audience letting them know that he knows about the cliches of the genre, and indeed he does a great job of subverting them on several occasions to good effect. However, on at least one occasion he oversteps this with a post-modern passage about Kvothe noting how his story sounds like a traditional campfire yarn and how his audience shouldn't get too comfortable just yet. Amusing, yes, but it took me out of the story. Not a good move.    Despite these minor problems, this is still an excellent fantasy novel, especially for a debut. The writing is very crisp and clear, with rich detail and some vivid characters. Rothfuss has done his homework and the University sections of the novel work very well, with mathmatics, metal-working, chemistry and music all forming part of the story in a very intricate manner. Rothfuss' magic system is also highly accomplished and original in conception and execution. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of Tad Williams, Joe Abercrombie, Scott Lynch or good, solid epic fantasy in general. Rothfuss hasn't necessarily done anything new here, but he's done it with a confidence and ability rare in a first-time novelist.    The Name of the Wind(****) is available now in the United States from DAW Publishing.
B00009W8N2|5.0|Opeth is by far one of the best metal bands today, and of all time. They're also one of my favorites, and certainly one of the most interesting, deep, complex, brutal and yet beautiful bands you can find. All of those adjectives describing their sound are presnted here on \\"Orchid\\". This is the album that started them off. \\"Orchid\\", their debut album, began a dynasty of one of metal's best bands.    Opeth is a band that may take some time to fully appreciate their songs. The songs are long, complex and may have hidden meanings in them that takes time to ponder. There also may be some passages that it may take several listenings to fully remember. Also, most Opeth material is best suited for listening to at night. There's something about listening to it then that just makes it even more amazing.    All right, well that describes the band as a whole, but let me begin to describe \\"Orchid\\". Well, quite often the sound tends to vary on each Opeth album, and their first is no exception. Whereas they created a more death-metal sound on albums like \\"My Arms, Your Hearse\\" or \\"Still Life\\", \\"Orchid\\" is probably their most black-metal sounding album, if not tied with \\"Morningrise\\". As with all Opeth albums, there are still gentle acoustic passages and beautiful, cleaning singing, but \\"Orchid\\" has the buzzing, razorblade guitar sound of black metal, the atmosphere of it, and Mikael uses more of a black metal howl than a death metal growl.    \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\": A fourteen-minute opener in C minor, this song kicks off with victorious-sounding, galloping riffs that are reminiscent of a heavier Iron Maiden. The songs flows into Mikael's aggressive howling about venturing to find his true love and thick, melodic riffs. Ending with sadder, slower but still beautiful riffs, this song is quite the metal epic.  \\"Under A Weeping Moon\\": The only non-interlude song that's under 10 minutes, this song is less mournful-sounding than \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\", but just as intense and epic. A great follow-up song.  \\"Silhouette\\": A three-minute, piano masterpiece played entirely by drummer Anders Nordin, this shows what an astounding, classical pianist he is. A riveting and intense interlude.  \\"Forest of October\\": My favorite song on the album, if not tied with the next song, and just over 13 minutes. This song starts off with slow, melodic, heavy riffs similar to Black Sabbath. A sudden stop, then we go into black metal tremolo picking guitar riffs and incredibly fast, double-bass drumming. At around 2:40, a simplistic but amazingly beautiful, acoustic guitar comes in with more incredibly fast double-kick drums. Harmonized, minor-key riffs follow with two blazing, riveting guitar solos over the course of the song. In this one, Mikael speaks of being in a forest in darkness, being very introspective and wishing to be set free of whatever holds him back in that place. A masterpiece of a song.  \\"The Twilight Is My Robe\\": This song is tied with \\"Forest of October\\" as my favorite song on the album. Eleven minutes long and the least mournful of all the songs, this song just sounds the most straight-up vicious as opposed to sad. Written with a lot of progressive music influences, this is an early Opeth classic.  \\"Requiem\\": A beautiful piece with harmonized bass guitar and acoustic guitar lines.  \\"The Apostle In Triumph\\": The first minute-and-a-half of this song are actually where \\"Requiem\\" left off but was accidentally put onto this song, apparently, which is why there's a pause of about five seconds. This song does have more heavy, death-metal riffs but is also quite progressive. However, the acoustic passages here seem to be most noticeable. There's something about this song that seems a little odder than any of the other songs, but it's still a great track.  Bonus Track:  \\"Into The Frost of Winter\\": A six-and-a-half minute extra song, this one is by far the most black-metal out of all the songs. The howling, the guitar riffs, even the recording is like other black metal bands of the time. An interesting and enjoyable extra song.    Having just gone through the entire album in written details, I hope I was informative and gave you a better idea about the sound of this album. For Opeth fans who don't have this yet, this is a highly recommended album. If you are a newcomer to Opeth, this is indeed a great album, but a better starting place would be \\"Blackwater Park\\" or \\"Still Life\\". However, no matter what you start with, I am of firm belief that this is one of the greatest and most unique metal albums of all time. Be sure to treasure this heavy, then soft, then heavy again, masterpiece! Thanks for the time, and peace.

1933771690|5.0|Challenging assumptions is always excellent mental exercise.  In this book Robert Lanza takes on one of the key tenets of modern thinking: that all scientific disciplines ultimately reduce to physics.  In its place he offers the provocative thesis that biology is primary, and the Universe literally flows from the conscious perceptions of living creatures.    On its face this sounds absurd, which demonstrates all the more just how brilliant this man is.  He draws on findings from quantum physics and anatomy studies to establish a series of foundational principles for his biocentric theory, which he then elaborates on and defends.      He begins by reminding us of something we all know but rarely think about: that reality is literally \\"all in our heads.\\"  We don't see the sunset, we see the interpretation of it our brain creates.  We don't smell the rose, we experience the sensation of a scent created by a neural network.    We believe that these impressions are imposed on us by what Stephen Hawking calls the RWOT (Real World Out There).  But our evidence for this belief amounts to subjective internal experiences!  In pointing this out Lanza shifts the burden of proof to the physicalists, who assert that the outside world is what is truly real, while our qualia are illusory.    He expands on this thought by citing evidence from quantum physics.    The famous two slit experiment, observations of split photons switching spin directions simultaneously, and observations of true backwards causation (the present determining the past) are all cited.  Einstein once asked a colleague if he truly believed that the moon wasn't in the sky if no one was looking at it.  Lanza would reply \\"of course it's not!\\"    In reading this book I was reminded of some of the implications of Relativity.  It occurred to me that there are no absolute measurements of length.  What my tape measure says is three feet would not be that at all  for someone traveling at 99.99% of light speed.  Nor wouldmy estimation of the distance from my living room to Disneyland be the same as theirs.  And their figures would be just as valid as mine!  If space and time are completely dependent on the perspective of the observer, then in what sense are they real?    I have to also comment on Lanza's excellent writing style.  He makes esoteric concepts understandable to laypeople like me.  He also injects quite a bit of his life story into the text, talking about how he escaped from a less than ideal upbringing to become a medical doctor and a highly regarded research scientist.  Being from a very similar background, I was able to identify with his struggles, though my resume is nowhere near as impressive as his.    This book so successfully challenged my current view of reality that it actually left me feeling a little unsettled, \\"creepy.\\"  But it also gave me an abundance of food for thought.  Am I convinced he's right?  Not yet.  But I suspect he may be.  So will you.  This book gets my highest recommendation.
B00004WN62|5.0|This record is in stereo, NOT mono. At least that's what arrived at MY door. Looking at the reviews here on Amazon, some of them say Mono and some say Stereo- I thought I'd receive a Mono version, but I received a Stereo version. The packaging says \\"Back to Black: 60th vinyl anniversary, premium audiophile pressing on heavyweight 180 gram vinyl in all original packaging\\" it also says \\"ALL ANALOG PRESSING\\". It sounds great and I'm very happy with it but I did want to review it and make note of the stereo/mono confusion. It also includes a nice full color mini-booklet with info about the making of the album and cool pics of Jimi and friends. I'd love to hear what the mono version sounds like, but I can't imagine it being a better choice than stereo for this spacey/trippy content.

0553582038|2.0|I decided to put the summary at the beginning, for anybody who doesn't like to read long reviews. If you wonder why I say what I say in the short version, the answer is likely in the long version.     Short version:     AFFC is long, boring, and seems very unfocused. In 800 pages, it didn't do nearly enough to justify the cost of the book, or the years-long wait for it.    For those of you who are determined to continue with the story, please get a copy in a way that doesn't put $$ in Martin's pocket; borrow a book from somebody, buy it used, download a copy, whatever. Ideally, enough of his readers will boycott his materials that he gets the message: finish what you start, and stop trying to take advantage of us while you do it.     Like many people, I really looked forward to this book. And also like many people, I was really disappointed. Continuing with this series is pointless. Even if ADWD is released anytime soon, who knows how many years until he deigns to write the book after that (and then the book after that...). At the rate he's going, he's more likely to \\"pull a Robert Jordan\\" and die before finishing the story. But who cares? He gets to play with little figurines now!     It appears that Martin has no respect for his readers. He started a (really good) story in the first three books, but is taking his own sweet time in finishing the story while he takes on other interests, while apparently ignoring that he has the luxury of taking on these other interests because of his ASOIAF fans. Now he is writing meandering yarns that are boring and so long that they have to be divided into two books; I would not be a bit surprised to learn that ADWD turns out to be as boring and meandering as AFFC is. Then he lied to us about the second half being ready when hindsight shows that it almost certainly wasn't. It is for these reasons that not only will I not buy the next book in this series, I will not buy anything from him, ever. It's a shame, too; he really is a talented writer, and if I thought he had handled his success more ethically, I would have been very willing to buy other stories from him. But not anymore.     //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////    Long version:     We as readers/fans are paying full-price for half of a book. Now we are expected to pay full-price (again!) for the other half of the book. I wonder if Martin understands (or even cares) why that would leave a bad taste in one's mouth.     Martin and his groupies compare him to Tolkien, and say in effect that \\"genius cannot be rushed\\". But there is at least one huge difference between what Tolkien did and what Martin is doing: Tolkien had the decency to finish the entire story (several years) before it was published. It's a shame that Martin didn't learn this from Tolkien. Also, Tolkien told his story *without dragging it out forever*.     It certainly seems that the story is becoming unfocused. Things did happen in this book, but not nearly enough to justify 800 pages. I think his editor should have done a much better job, and not let Martin indulge every thought that entered his head. To me, this is extremely reminiscent of the Wheel of Time series; it started off very well, but after a few books it slowed way down. I can't help but wonder if the reason this happened (in both cases) is because the authors were seduced by the money/praise for creating a successful story, and decided to drag it out as long as possible in order to squeeze every last dime out of it. Listening to Martin (and his apologists) blame \\"publishing pressure\\" for splitting the book is laughable; he should show a little maturity and take responsibility for his own (in-)actions; he has been writing long enough to know what is acceptable from a publishers perspective.    Splitting the book *may* have been excusable if the second half had been provided in a timely fashion, as he promised. After all, according to Martin's note in AFFC, he had finished the entire book and it was simply too big to sell as a single volume. Then the story changed: it wasn't written yet, but was in the works. Then it was going to be finished on 'this date'... until it got pushed back. So either Martin lied originally, or he lied later. Given the way events have played out, I think it's clear that he lied to us when he said that the second half of the book had been written and would be published within a year or so of AFFC. Meanwhile, instead of actually finishing the second half he spends his time selling figurines and replica weapons, writing other books, editing books, etc etc. Given how long it's taking to get the other (half-)book ADWD, which was supposedly already almost finished four years ago, I shudder to think how long it will take to get the book after that, and how many pieces that one will be broken up into.     Here's what we have so far:  Book 1: AGOT, published Aug 1996  Book 2: ACOK, published Feb 1999  Book 3: ASOS, published Oct 2000  Book 4: AFFC, published Nov 2005    So it's taken 13 years to get 3.5 books, of a supposed seven book series (which was originally going to be a trilogy, btw).

B0017V7GTY|5.0|Gaslight Anthem has, justifiably, been criticized for backing up their U-Haul to Bruce Springsteen's house and taking everything that wasn't nailed down.  However, while their music does indeed echo the Boss in more ways than one, the Gaslight Anthem is much more than that.<br /><br />First, let's look at the similarities--there's definitely a similar song structure, songs about beautiful losers, and lots of girls named Mary.<br /><br />But here's where things get different--there's no 'big' sound, a la The E Street Band, but rather a muscular hard rock-Americana hybrid that's mostly comprised of the good old bar band staple of two guitars, bass, and drums.  Sure, there are flourishes here and there, but they exist to serve the song, like the chains rattling in \\"The 59 Sound.\\"<br /><br />Another difference is the literary element that exists in the lyrics.  Who would have thought that an American rock outfit would drop Dickens references into it's lyrics?  In many ways, that's fitting...Dickens' best works combined desperation and hope that left the reader satisfied.  Gaslight Anthem does the same thing. They sing about loss without being bitter, about heartbreak without being angry.  In the hands of a lesser band, \\"Here's Looking at You, Kid\\" would be an angry diatribe against former lovers.  GA makes it a sly, gentle prod at these same people.<br /><br />Also lyrically, the Boss would never have penned a line like \\"I always kinda sorta wished I looked like Elvis.\\"  That's not dissing Springsteen, it's praising GA for their lyrical sense.  Of course, later in the same song they quote directly from Bruce's \\"I'm On Fire.\\"<br /><br />So, while they aren't wholly original, they do much more than just ape their influences.  It's refreshing to hear a band wear its influences on its sleeve, and still be more than a bland copy.  As the Gaslight Anthem grows and continues to develop and discover their own sound (\\"The Backseat\\" and \\"Miles Davis\\" are solid examples of the band branching out), I predict ever greater things.  If the Hold Steady are the saviors of socially-conscious hard-party literate rock, then Gaslight Anthem could very well be the saviors of Blue Collar Americana.<br /><br />Highly recommended.things.  If the Hold Steady are the saviors of socially-conscious hard-party literate rock, then Gaslight Anthem could very well be the saviors of Blue Collar Americana.     Highly recommended.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I love Natalie Kidmann's acting.  She was perfect in the role of a wealthy woman defending her land in Australia.  She has great comedic timing along with her beauty and dramatic talents...all these contributed to my pure enjoyment of this movie.  If you love epic type movies, the beauty of Australia, and romance as well, then definitely see this movie.  The little boy in the movie is a real scene stealer.
B00000DR5I|2.0|This may have been a cool and revolutionary album at the time it was conceived, partucularly when people hadn't been hearing these kinds of sounds before, but today it all sounds awfully dated.   Part one consists of an endlessly repeating bassline with a synced delay, a fistful of throbbing drones and whooshes and over the top some improvised synthesized woodwind playing. Part two is basically the same without the bassline (well, it comes in later) and instead some murky male choir sounds playing random complex chords. Lots of Mellotrons and late 70's electronic gadgets. Sorry, not my cup of tea.  Why, anybody can purchase or download a few software modular synthesizers and create music just like this. Being an amateur musician and having my own electronic music studio at hand, I have done exactly that just for fun, so I know exactly how easy it is. Trust me on that.  Cue those tiresome comments, \\"if it's so easy, why haven't we seen your albums lately?\\". Because no label today would touch anything like this.
B000063DHL|5.0|Somewhere in Time introduced synth into the Iron Maiden world of music. It's very intelligently used and I must say, it makes this album better as a whole.    Track Breakdown:    1. Caught Somewhere in Time - Speedy rocker. Holds up to the likes of Invaders, Moonchild, Aces High, and so on. 4 stars.  2. Wasted Years - Very catchy song. 5 stars.  3. Sea of Madness - Never appealed to me much, great, just doesn't jump out at you. 4 stars.  4. Heaven Can Wait - Though people say the chorus is catchy, and it is somewhat, it sounds very forced and even a bit out of tune. 4 stars.  5. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner - Now that the title is finish, time for the song review. Great song with many suprises. The drum part is very interesting, as is the song as a whole. 5 stars.  6. Stranger in a Strange Land - Guess what?, strange song. Very catchy and very good, just a bit strange. 5 stars.  7. Deja Vu - One of the bests on the album. Very strange lyrics and a great riff. 5 stars.  8. Alexander the Great - The epic of this album. Holds up to every epic other album closer, other than Hallowed by thy Name. Also, a fun and quick history lesson. :D    To wrap things up, they introduced a new element to their music, but thank goodness it worked nearly perfectly. Check out Seventh Son of a Seventh Son if you want the best synth Maiden can offer, though.
B000VH3FV8|5.0|Some of the best Luther Vandross songs that were ever released or unreleased to date! I sob when he sings \\"Knocks me off my feet\\", or \\"Never Let me Go\\" and I just see my father when he sings, \\"Dance with my Father Again\\"! I would buy it over and over again!
B0007TKNII|1.0|I'm a huge Phan of the show. It's my all time favorite musical because it was the first show I had ever seen on Broadway and also because it was just amazing IMO. When I heard there was a movie coming out based on the play, I was really excited. However, when I was watching it, I thought, \\"What have they done?!\\" The first thing to point out is that every one is a terrible singer. Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson are too weak and they're the romantic leads. Gerard Butler (he was great in 300 but...) has no business playing the Phantom. I understand that he was trying to add a new rock-style to the role and I appreciate that but for the Phantom it just doesn't work. He basically screams the notes instead of singing them and when he doesn't scream he just swallows the notes so it sounds artificial and not beautiful. Second, the lip-syncing was beyond saving. During \\"Think of Me\\" Christine sings kinda pretty but her lips are barely moving and just stands there like a lifeless mannequin. Gerard Butler just over enunciates everything so it looks pretty ridiculous. Third, the direction by Joel Schumacher (the guy behind the atrocious Batman & Robin) is lazy. He's so concerned with the fabulous art direction and cinematography that he forgets about the story and characters. The whole movie is just so dull that the sense of excitement and romance in the play are lost in the transition to the silver screen. Overall, I can't recommend this as decent entertainment although I know I stand against the masses. Skip this one. Watch the musical instead.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Don't expect to walk through this one.... Jillian breaks you down.  I'm a 25 yr old male and I'm in good shape, but I still get a whoopin every time I do these workouts.  Workout #1 is a good quick and easy, but #2 and #3 whip me.  I'm always extremely tired/sweaty once I've finished.  I like this DVD because when I get home from work the last thing I want to do is spend hours at a gym.  I use 10lb weights and it really works me.  Highly recommended!
B001V9LRV0|1.0|I was lead to believe by all the hoopla that this was going to be worth the money and worth the wait.  I was sadly disappointed.  For all the build up to this \\"40th Anniversary\\", the result is sadly  underwhelming.  You get a bunch of advertising, knock-off memorabilia, a hokey plastic prismatic paper weight and a fringed faux leather case cover.  What about the music you ask?  With all the great music played over those three days, this is the classic missed opportunity.  This \\"Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" could have and should have had three or four disks full of great musical performances.  Instead you will be treated to a  stream of fuzzy, out-of-focus video of traffic jams, farm animals, set construction, crowd shots and stoner vignettes.  For variety, they even throw in an interview with Hugh Heffner!  To be sure, there are some good tracks but the original CD was better. Way too much behind-the-scenes footage and not nearly enough music. They should be ashamed of themselves for what this could have been. Maybe they'll get it right for the 50th Anniversary ultimate edition.
0743270754|4.0|This book seems very intimidating sitting on a shelf, but once you open it up, it quite easy reading. This is essentially four biographies in one: Lincoln, Salmon Chase, William Seward, and Edward Bates. The first 40% of the book is the history of these four men, their pursuit for the 1860 presidency, and Lincoln's election. The rest of the book is a more general history of Lincoln's presidency and there is slightly less focus given to the other three characters (for the most part, they just become a part of the Cabinet).    Other reviewers have pointed out the focus Goodwin put on the social lives of the Cabinet wives. I understand her reason for it, but I found it at times distracting from the real story. For a book that is already so comprehensive, adding this element seems unnecessary, at least to the degree that she did. My only other complaint is that occasionally Goodwin will mention persons without identifying who they are (or that identity was explained some hundred pages before).    Overall, this book is extremely well written and thoroughly researched. It is easy to read and should not be considered a book for only serious history buffs. Those with even a mild interest in history should be able to enjoy this. The one condition to that is that this is NOT a history of the Civil War, so many major military events are mentioned only in passing.
B001V9LRTM|4.0|First the amazon extras aren't on a extra disc,they are on the  offical BR bonus disc,and they are super .In fact the bonus footage  looks better than the footage in the Directors Cut ,which even though  sounds fantastic and looks the best it ever did,Looks grainy and less  colorful compared with bonus songs  Also they seem to not included most of the Footage from the Woodstock  Diaries anywhere on the set,so you don't have footage of a lot  of stuff like more CSNY ,Sly,John Sebastion,Airplane ect or any  footage of the Band.
B002BPQ0Y2|3.0|I could not wait for the new BEP cd to come out - I even went to Target at lunch to buy it so I could have it ASAP.  After listening to it all the way through, my first thought was \\"dang, that's it?\\".  It is SO NOT the BEP that we all know and love.  I gave it 3 stars because it's still got some good beats.  Not nearly as many fun lyrics and vocals though - like the others said, lots of electronic sounding stuff.<br /><br />My recommendation - buy the CD from Target so that you can get the bonus CD.  Totally made it worth the $9.98.  It's 10 extra songs (6 remixes and 4 new songs), and it reminds you of the \\"old\\" BEP.
1416955070|5.0|I bought the Mortal Instrument for my teen daughter and she finished reading all 3 books within 2 weeks! She was had one word for it...\\"EPIC\\"!!! She insist that I read it and reluctantly, I read the first book and could not put it down! Cassandra's story telling was incredible with such an amazing imagination! I too referred it to my husband (who doesn't care for reading) and to my surprise he could not put the books down. He agree that this trilogy was EPIC! And would definitely read it again.
031606792X|5.0|I love this whole series... It is made for teenagers, but I still couldn't get enough even though I'm 24. Love Love Love Edward Cullen (I want one of my own)! lol ;o)
B0014DBZT2|5.0|After listening to this pick, I was a bit more upbeat and motivated than a normal listening of this artist's previous work.  Nevertheless, it still invoked a contemplative sense of amazement that will always keep me coming back for more.  Highly recommended.
159562015X|5.0|I was given this book at a recent workshop on strengths. I took the short online quiz and I was surprised. I knew many of these things about myself but I had not been able to articulate it so concisely and thorougly as was done here.    I am searching for a new position and I have been told I need to stand out in the crowd. The results of the quiz helped me identify my strengths to potential employers.    I appreciated the book so much that I purchased several copies for my work mates and my husband.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|We recently ourchased this video/CD and it was GREAT!!!  A one-of-a-kind purchase.  As a result, several of our friends just had to have one too.  It is a work of art.
B001PPGAIK|4.0|A beautiful and stirring film, \\"Australia\\" harks back to the old Hollywood epics in terms of its grand sweep and well-written central characters, yet it is also unique both in its exotic locale and its portrayal of an under-represented people.    Baz Lurhmann's previous films were often \\"over the top\\" (to say the least), yet \\"Australia\\" feels more serious and more important somehow. There are elements of Luhrmann's humor and sense of wild spectacle, yet overall the film adheres to a more conventional storytelling model, and presents the audience with an intimate look at a vast, often mysterious continent.     Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman are the big names, while a host of aboriginal actors bring to life a culture that has never before been portrayed with such honesty and sensitivity (at least in a U.S. film).     Very worthwhile viewing, and a reference-quality Blu-Ray disc.
B0016QNSFQ|3.0|This work is really a very low-budget theatrics performance cinematographed.<br /><br />Also mixing kid's impressions with psycho-trembling of England-settled Austrian-grown sexual-minorities-representing adult looked funny and acting is nice, philosophy depicted just questions what all these philosophers are paid for.<br /><br />What is really interesting, Tariq Ali, a Pakistani living famous intellectual's interview in the extras: a reviewer was shot of info about his link to Derek Jarman.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was already going to the gym three times a week and then my wife asked me to try this workout with her to see if it would make a difference. 30 days later I was stunned to see how much difference a 20 minute workout could make on my weight and more importantly my muscle definition.     This workout put more definition in my abs than the last year of going to the gym. The results have been amazing especially given the low time commitment. I heartily recommend this to anyone who is looking for a workout video that will make a difference.
1569242739|4.0|While I've had problems with the actual cake recipes from this book (as in I won't use them-- I'll just incorporate their ideas into my go-to recipes), I very much enjoy this book.  Whenever I want a unique cupcake idea, this is the first place I turn.  The photos in this book are amazing, as are the cupcake concoctions.  I mean, who thinks up banana split or s'mores cupcakes?!  Creative, clever and fun... no one will even guess that the cupcakes are vegan.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|I am a huge fan of Meryl Streep and I was not disappointed in this performance.  She captured the feel of a Catholic nun way back when.  I even got the feeling I should be hiding my knuckles from the patrolling ruler...Phillip Seymour Hoffman was also outstanding.    I am still trying to figure out how neither of them got an academy award!
B0013N3DSE|5.0|In the late 30's, color film was expensive, and controversial. Many actors refused to be filmed in color, and some audience members found color film tasteless. Nevertheless, Errol Flynn's potrayal of Robin Hood became iconic, and the recent Blu-Ray transfer of this classic adventure film helps to show why.    The colors come through as garish and over-the-top, exactly what a film of this genre needs. There is not a hint of film grain, and the mono soundtrack is crystal clear. It is the perfect reference disc for seeing what Technicolor could deliver even in its infancy, and a rousing and fun adventure film in its own right.
B0025X4OYI|4.0|The editorial is not exactly true when is states that MSICWM Volume 2 has never appeared on CD before.  All but 3 tracks were released in 1992 by Castle Communications (Australia) stating that the tracks were digitally remixed by Ray Charles and Steve Hoffman from the original 1962-1965 ABC-Paramount session masters. I can only assume that this same CD was made available in other countries, as they would hardly go to all that trouble for a country with a total population of 20 million, not all of which would buy the disc.    MSICWM Volume 1 issued by Rhino in 1988 also included a track from Volume 2, \\"You are my sunshine\\".    This may all sound like nit-picking, but Concord must have known all this when they wrote their press release.    While it is great to have both albums conveniently on one CD, the sound quality of this new remaster isn't all that different from the Rhino release of 21 years ago, so this disc's greatest asset is the complete Volume 1 & 2 being available on the one disc.    As for the content, what can you say ? The man was a genius and these are classic recordings that will remain in the catalogue forever.  I'm just disappointed that there wasn't a significant improvement in the sound quality. I know Concord can do it, as they lovingly restored [[ASIN:B000UZ4FKQ Ray Sings Basie Swings]] and mastered it in DSD and 24 bit/96 kHZ, which sounds fantastic. Maybe they will consider releasing a high resolution version of this disc, to satisfy those who want audiophile standard releases.    Either way, the recordings are masterpieces.

0061537969|4.0|In Seattle Enzo the mixed breed dog believes he is different from most if not all other canines as he knows he has a human soul and looks forward to his reincarnation as a man.  He adores his human companion Denny and loves their bachelor existences.  Denny works at an auto repair shop trying to obtain the capital needed to become a racing driver.  Enzo supports the dream by watching racing on TV especially tapes involving his best friend and has become an expert on the subject, but is frustrated with his inability to communicate with his two legged buddy.<br /><br />Denny meets and falls in love with Eve.  They marry but the woman and the dog mistrust one another.  Denny is away racing when Eve goes into labor; she turns to Enzo as her coach.  Enzo loves the new baby, Zoe, but also fears for the mom as her \\"odor\\" smells rancid.  Eve becomes ill and dies.  Her parents who loathe Denny sue for custody of Zoe although they know they have no chance of winning.  Instead they arrange for their fifteen years old niece to seduce Enzo, but he rejects the teen.  Still she screams rape and now his case is weak.  With Enzo still riding shotgun, Denny keeps fighting.<br /><br />Told by Enzo, THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN is an engaging inspirational tale that encourages people to go after your dreams.  The story line is filled with metaphors especially comparing life to race car driving on an oval track.  Although the in-laws' shenanigans seem unreal particularly compared with a dog thinking like a human, fans will enjoy this fine uplifting anthropomorphic saga of life as seen through the personification of a thinking person's dog.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001NESPHC|5.0|Late night jazz club, a wink across the bar, and then slipping quietly out the door together when you can't take the suspense of seduction any longer ...is what this album is. Dark and sultry, it has a deeper tone than Worrisome Heart. I am amazed at the quality of Melody's voice, and how she can carry a tune for so long, but so softly and slowly. That takes talent. This is a brilliant addition to her repertoire.     One question...is anyone else a little disturbed about what's going on at the end of \\"If the Stars were Mine?\\" I can't make out the words, does anyone know what is being said so desperately?
B001TOD92C|5.0|There have been other Wrestling Movies like Dirk Benidict in Body Slam and the terrible Ready To Rumble,however they were more campy Comedy-type Movies that really didn't take themselves seriously and was more of A fictional Protrayal of Professional Wrestling.The Wrestler was the only Movie dealing with Professional Wrestling as A serious subject.Dealing with Wrestlers themselves and their personal lives and how much they sacrificed to entertain people who spend their hard earned money to see them and cheer and boo for them.They show the physical torment they endure inside and outside the Ring and the vices that are common in really any Sport (I.E Drugs Steroid use etc.).But instead of making light of them or embarrasing Pro Wrestling they do it in A way that respects Wrestling yet does point them out in A very respectful manner.<br /><br />This movie really reminds me of what I felt when I first saw the Movie Rocky Balboa.Throughout the whole Movie you really deeply feel for Mick Rourke's Character and all the hardships He experiences.Especially since I'm A Huge Pro Wrestling Fan since I was five years old and I know the KayFabe (inside look in Professional Wrestling) system quite well.I was glad to see other Pro Wrestlers in the Movie.Marisa Tomei (Hope I spelled her name right) was spectacular and justified her Oscar Win for My Cousin Vinny-She was truly great and deserved another.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into detail about the Movie,because I don't want to give the story away-I will say that as A Professional Wrestling Fan I believe they honored the Sport of Professional Wrestling and all the Wrestlers who ever stepped into the squared circle.They did it tastefully without compromising A single thing and to all the Haters of Pro Wrestling will I'd like to believe will look at Pro Wrestling with A better light.For anybody that likes A heartfelt,emotional and just like watching Fantastic Movies you will be hard pressed to find A better one than The Wrestler.I loved the Movie and you will too I'm sure.ie and you will too I'm sure.

B00258SS72|5.0|Eastwood continues to amaze making films as good as this one in the latter stages of his career. He doesn't rely on sci-fi gimmics or CGI, just the nuts and bolts of great movies: story and acting. This movie is no exception. It's a very good story about an Asian family moving into a run down house in a deteriorating neighborhood next to a very hardened old S.O.B. of a retired auto worker. Bigotry ensues, gang activity follows and under the masterful direction of Eastwood, a great film is born. Don't miss this one!

1433502410|4.0|The ESV Study Bible has to be without a doubt the BEST evangelical study bible out there in the market today. Though the NIV Study Bible (Zondervan) has always been touted to be the best evangelical study bible for many years (with the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible coming a close second [also by Zondervan]), the recently published ESV Study Bible takes the whole cake when it comes evangelical scholarship, theological perspective (generally Reformed/Calvinist), study notes, graph and map quality, and print type. In fact, the last section of this study bible provides a nice general overview of various theological, historical, and biblical themes (pp. 2499-2661) that many readers will find valuable. These discussions range from the traditional doctrines of systematic theology to the method and history of interpreting and reading the Bible. Though the notes may be a bit technical for many readers the way the authors write their articles and expositions makes it quite easy to understand for the average layperson.<br /><br />Having said that there is still one problem with this study bible: the size. This study bible is physically massive! If you're going to carry this bible to church I suggest you take a backpack with you. It's like carrying a thick piece of rectangular brick. If this study bible was about the same size as the NIV Study Bible it would have been perfect. The NIV Study Bible and the Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible have about the same amount of notes and articles and it is still a reasonable size. I don't know why Crossway decided to make this study bible so massive. Perhaps they should come up with a reduced version with a smaller print in the next edition. Even with that little complaint I still encourage people to pick up this study bible. It is worth every penny spent.

0316168815|2.0|The Lovely Bones was, simply put, a disappointing reading experience. For starters, it was not very well written. In the beginning, the overall simplicity of language could be beautiful in its own right, but by the end, the novel's utter lack of sophistication turned it into something childish.    The seams holding the novel together broke apart near the end. Although The Lovely Bones uses an interesting concept of a girl looking down from heaven at a family coping with her loss, almost a decade after her death, the extent to which she still holds influence over people's lives is totally unbelievable. A classmate of the protagonist, for example, is forever haunted by her loss and continues to record the traces of abused women she finds as an artist in New York City.    Endings of novels are meant to be powerful and ultimately decide whether the work stands or falls flat. In this case, unfortunately, the latter was what occurred. After a certain point, the author dragged on and on, and as a reader, all one could wish for was that the author had instead cut her losses, cut short, and stopped writing when she had nothing left to say.    I would also say that one particular scene in which the protagonist returns briefly to earth to \\"make love\\" to a former middle-school crush is highly disappointing. What was the author thinking? In a series of choppy sequences, this novel finally splatters.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Mesmerized, time and time again.  I have watched this film more times than any film of my 68 years.  My DVD library is in excess of 800 movies with only about 30 in Blu-ray.  Without any question, the picture quality, and content in my opinion, is better than any film available today.   The most difficult thing after seeing this film is trying to explain it to someone else.    Congratulations to those who produced and worked on this great film, including Bruce Simballa.

B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I just love the Gilmore Girls so whatever you ask me, I would answer \\"wonderful, I love it\\". Actors are amazing, it is funny, very well written, actually incredibly clever for a TV show, a lot of references, so we learn in the same time. I can't stop watching this story, everything is inside. It makes us want to live in Stars Hollow ! If only the whole world could be so nice, so funny, so crazy, so exciting ! If only we could have more neighbors and friends like these ones ! It is more than a TV show, it is a classic, a must-have absolutely.

B0026IBY72|3.0|My Jane Austen Kick Continues! This is the story of Jane, a quirky New Yorker who is gifted a fantasy trip to \\"Austenland\\" where she gets to pretend to live the life of someone similar to a Jane Austen character during Regency times. The \\"vacation\\" lasts about three weeks. Jane's trip is a fun escape, but she also uses the trip to try and prove to herself that romantic men like Mr.Darcy of Pride & Prejudice are not worth pining over and fantasizing about.<br /><br />There are several comedic moments (Mrs.Charming's attempt at proper British is hilarious with her \\"what-whats\\" here and there), and there are some surprising romantic twists and turns in the plot (and fun make-out sessions, too). The characters in this story aren't who they seem to be, and I was a bit confused by some of them at times.<br /><br />The author was able to pull the story together nicely at the end, and, even though the ending seemed liked it was put together quickly, it was a good one. I recommend this to anyone looking for an enjoyable, fast read.

B0026JWDQW|3.0|I fell in LOVE with Paolo Nutini when I heard his debut CD, \\"These Streets.\\"  I would give that CD six stars if I could.    This new CD, \\"Sunny Side Up\\" has some good catchy tunes, however its also filled with some slower songs that are not as enjoyable.  I am a fan of his older slower songs, but these new ones I just can't get into as much.    I am glad I bought it overall... I guess I was just expecting another fantastic album after his last, and to me it just fell short of the mark.
B001TODO54|5.0|I was very pleased with this book. It wasn't too easy but it also wasn't too hard to follow the plot and the interactions. Read it in 4 days and was excited to pick it up and keep reading. Very entertaining and enjoyed it a lot.
B0019OP0GU|3.0|This movie version of  the children's classic is well-acted by a lovely cast, but lacks the charm and interest of the original (which remains worth reading).  Still, suitable for family viewing, and, though the ending falls flat, moderately entertaining.  A chick flick for young girls.

B001V9LRV0|1.0|After carefully removing the DVDs from the cardboard sleeves to ***avoid scratching***, I found all four DVDs badly scuffed from being jammed into the cardboard sleeves. These sleeves are a disaster waiting to happen. If they must be cardboard, why not digi-paks with a spindle to offer some protection to the playing surface? A replacement is enroute from Amazon but I am not holding my breath. If (when?) these DVDs arrive scuffed, I'll be asking for a refund![[ASIN:B001V9LRV0 Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)]]

B00192IV0O|2.0|I loved all of their previous albums and I liked almost every song on those but this album is weak. Everything is amateur at best and I think they were just too lazy to put the effort in to make it a stand out album. This will be the last album I order from them without listening to it first. Very disappointing.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Whether or not you know the music of ABBA, it's a romp!    This is definitely eye candy. It's Greek island setting is beautiful.    It's worth the price just to see Pierce Brosnan sing and dance in disco drag.
B001GM28HO|4.0|Chances are you've fallen for lots of her music - sung by other famous artists - and wondered why? Because she's got a knack for hooks. So, imagine an entire album with HER doin HER stuff! She does it impeccably, too. Look out divas and queens of pop, now that GAGA's got the floor, she might knock everybody else out of the arena.
0425220931|4.0|I really enjoyed this book a lot. It presented ineresting views on music by looking at life and vice versa. The only downside was that it was written for a very low level of reading; however, this made is a very quick and easy-to-understand read. Props to Victor for sharing his mind-opening lessons with the world!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|I know that if you've seen Season 7 and haven't seen Season 8 yet that 5 stars can be a little hard to swallow. Stick with me though and I'll do my best to explain why Season 8 is Smallville at it's best. Season 7 was a really weird transition for the show because after Season 6 the show really didn't have anything to offer whatsoever. The actors seemed to be lackluster and the writing had gotten pretty sloppy. Alas, all the Smallville fans out there stuck with it through a very rough patch and Season 8 is the reward.   With a mostly fresh cast and the transition from Smallville to Metropolis, the show was given new life with an endless amount of fun and entertainment. Like I said in my title, the show really doesn't even feel like the previous seasons of Smallville. It really is Superman, or the Red-Blue Blur as he becomes known in Season 8, without any flying or tights. It's really a ton of fun and the introduction of the villain Doomsday was a brilliant move by the writers. Sam Witwer is really great as Davis, Doomsday's human side. Because of Doomsday the Season does seem a bit darker compared to all the others. It is a nice change though and it's what the show needed. Tom Welling is really great this season also and it's amazing how much more enthusiastic he seems compared to last season.  There are really some standout episodes this Season. My personal favorites include Infamous, Doomsday, Bride, Legion, Beast, and Hex. The rest of the episodes, aside from Power and Requiem which are pretty terrible, are just as good as anything the other seasons have offered.  Most importantly of all, Season 8 is just a blast to watch. It's hard to believe that the show could be so good without Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover. Believe it though. Or just pick up Season 8 and find out for yourself.
B000JLQS7E|3.0|This is a video of a 1985 La Scala performance of Aida with Luciano Pavarotti as Radam&egrave;s, Maria Chiara as Aïda, Ghena Dimitrova as Amneris, Juan Pons as Amonasro, Nicolai Ghiaurov as Ramfis and Paata Burchuladze as the King. It has been released several times before: [[ASIN:B00002NDLW Verdi - Aida / Maazel, Chiara, Pavarotti, La Scala]] or [[ASIN:B0017KZ7TQ Verdi / Pavarotti / Chiara / Dimitrova / Ghiaurov / Pons - Aida (1985)]]. And it is a pretty good performance hampered by a production that has elements of gigantism (and I don't just mean Pavarotti, who is indeed as large as he ever was in this production), left-wing commentary about imperialism (lots of poor slaves suffering), unnecessary humongous statuary that the poor slaves have to keep moving about, naked women (in the opening of Act II) followed by naked Nubian boys. The singing is impressive all round.<br /><br />However, the draw for this particular package was supposed to be the contemporaneous South Bank Show (BBC, hosted by Melvyn Bragg), entitled 'Aïda File - The Making of Aïda', which unfortunately has great chunks of untranslated (or un-subtitled) Italian by such personages as Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, Pierluigi Petrobelli and the production's director, Luca Ronconi. Why there are no subtitles or English voice-overs I have no idea. But there you are. Frustrating in the extreme for this monolingual American viewer, I can tell you.<br /><br />If you understand Italian this package might be for you. Otherwise I'd suggest, if you're interested in owning this particular production, that you buy one of the less-expensive versions without the documentary.<br /><br />Running time: Opera 160 mins, Documentary 72 mins; Sound: PCM Stereo, Dolby digital; Opera subtitles: German, English, French, Dutch, Spanish; Format: 4:3; Region Code: 0 (worldwide)<br /><br />Scott Morrison
076790592X|1.0|\\"He waited for these kisses like a puppy waits for milk.\\"  Seriously?  Albom really thought this was a good analogy to use?  When I read that line, I literally rolled my eyes.  My 10 year old nephew writes better than Albom.  The poor grammar, run-on sentences, etc, made me cringe.  Not to mention, it was obvious that Albom only got in touch with Morrie because Morrie had been on Nightline.  Albom wrote that his main goal in life had been to be famous.  Thanks to good ol' Morrie, he's accomplished it.  Albom fancies himself a great writer.  Don't be fooled by the hype.  This isn't good writing nor thought provoking.  I was too distracted by the technical errors.
159562015X|1.0|I took the test earlier today. I was also surprised about the fact that I could only take the test once (one user = one use?). Great marketing tool. Nicely misleading - now I have to buy more copies to retake the test! Or tell coworkers to buy the book so they can take the test! I bet Gallup's marketing department loved pushing that idea! 'Let's sell access to corporations and make a killing from word-of-mouth referrals!' And on top of that - if we hook any poor sucker, lets make them pay an extra $550 for more largely useless information - just so they can get the order of the other 29 'strengths'.     Still, I can't begrudge someone's right to make money. This system definitely limits piracy - although it severely limits the 'shelf-life' of this book on my bookcase. I'm not likely to reread this for nuggets of wisdom.    I majored in psychology and have taken lots of personality tests, also the Myers-Briggs test, politicial spectrum tests, IQ, EQ tests in my time... I am more than a little skeptical of a lot of the tools (I am talking about the test out there, the makers of these tests and the people who swear by them) and their ability to tell us anything more meaningful and practical than a daily horoscope.    I think the book is interesting - maybe as a coaching tool for staff members that are hypersensitive to even the most benign comment a have poor basic skills in many areas that don't meet the standards set by others. Concentrating on their strengths might be a way of keeping them engaged for a time (until their 'weaknesses' causes a massive problem and you are forced to fire them).    Check out this site I found that discusses the weaknesses of StrengthsFinder    [...]    Don't get me wrong - I think that it is an interesting test. I also think SLII by Ken Blanchard is interesting and easy to use as a coaching tool. Both are gross simplifications of complexities for the sake of clarity and direction. This should not to be taken as gospel and to overly encourage people (managers) to ignore training people to overcome and compensate for their weaknesses.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I'm a recent college grad and amateur musician(piano, sax, guitar). and I've owned these headphones since June of 2004(5 years later they still sound as great as when I first bought them). I had originally purchased them for use with my electronic instruments (synthesizers and guitars) but these soon became the only pair of headphones I reach for when I want to listen to anything. The sound is fantastic, exactly the way the artist intended it, and it's easy to pick up all the different nuances within a piece of music. Sure I look like a dork while wearing them in public, but its a small price to pay for the amazing sound.<br /><br />They are INCREDIBLY rugged. I totally mistreat these things, but the plastic and metal construction has held up to years of being thrown in backpacks and gear bags. Also, The cord shows little sign of wear(the plastic coating is really thick) and the stitching on the headband is holding tight. Other reviewers say these things have lasted them decades, and I'm a believer. Just keep them in the included leather bag to prevent scratches, and they'll stay nice and shiny black.<br /><br />It's absolutely true these are an \\"industry standard\\", my favorite sighting is on one of the Lord of the Rings DVDs were you can clearly see Peter Jackson sporting a pair of MDR 7506s while filming on location in New Zealand.<br /><br />The only flaw in the design is the pleather pads that come with the phones. These become really sweaty and uncomfortable with long wear (which is what you'll be doing when you have these, you won't want to take them off). And after years of use, the plastic covering will start peeling off and become a total mess. Swapping the pads for \\"beyerdynamic edt 250\\" velour pads is a must. Not only does it make them more comfortable, but it blocks out more sound, and excenuates the bass (well, that could be a bad thing depending on your tastes, but if you're spending this much for headphones you know how to use an equalizer, right?).
B001VB8UAE|5.0|This was a GREAT and entertainment DVD.  If you are a fan of Mrs. Steisand you will enjoy her DVD set, I did.

This is a must purchase for you Barbara Streidand Fans.

I found myself reading his story and repeatedly asking myself, How? How does one overcome what he has and still smile? This book has, somewhat selfishly, feel more fortunate for what I have. No matter what troubles me, it is no comparison. I look forward to hearing more from Ishmael.

They are delicious and nutritious, and my kids love them. This book is a gold mine for anyone who wants a healthier alternative to the white flour and sugar found in traditional desserts. I am thrilled to have found it, would love to visit the actual Babycakes in NYC, and the author is a genius.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|Greatest Hits  being Young's 3rd compilation and is an album \\"based on original record sales, airplay and download history\\". The album was met with great reviews by the critics and was given a full score by Allmusic. It also did well with the public peaking at #27 on the Billboard 200. We get a list of whom plays what for each track. We also get a nice mini poster of Neil Young looking pensive with his guitar. 4/5.
1579126278|5.0|It's one of my favorite Christie's because I actually was able to figure out who murdered Roger Ackroyd -a very very rare thing for me with her books.  The reason I loved it and it wasn't spoiled for me, is because throughout the remainder of the book (from where I picked up on something) I watched all the little cunning tricks laid out for readers to follow...truly awe inspiring.    This is a great Christie to read after reading at least a dozen others of hers..you'll remember why you appreciate her uniqueness.  The setting, the timing, the characters, the plot, they are all superb and it amazes me that this was such an early novel of her mystery writing career.  Trust me, read several before reading this one and you'll appreciate it so much more.

We also get some great photographs of a very young Dylan. 4/5.

B001EN71DG|3.0|I'm a Star Wars purist; as far as I'm concerned, Star Wars was over in 1983.  There are no prequels, and no Special Editions.  I would LOVE to have remastered DVDs of the untouched, unmolested original movies, but I doubt it's going to happen.  At this point, with Lucas's ego running wild as it is, I'm mainly concerned with having a copy of the original movies that my kids will one day be able to watch.  To that end, I don't mind the second-rate audio and video on the only discs that I bought this set for.

The first day after I did this workout, I could hardly walk because my legs hurt so bad.  If Jillian \\"grates\\" on you, then no, you probably won't like this workout video.

0375842209|5.0|THE BOOK THIEF is found in the Young Adult section of my local  bookstores which is a terrible disservice to anyone who wants an extraordinary, unique read. Yes, the main character is a young girl, but the narrator is Death and the story tells of the harrowing, and yet, in some ways, uplifting times in which she lives. There are few books that have made me cry at the conclusion or made me want to continue reading-and this book is lengthy-and wonder more about Liesel Meminger. The writing is such that one can visualize the characters and their world. This is beyond the typical YA novel.

Unless meyers is setting up for another series, with Nessie as the lead character, All those trees that died to make Breaking dawn died  for nothing.

0440241588|3.0|With the usual vices of greedily gotten money, expensive adult toys, exotic world travel and the usual cat-and-mouse game of the all-powerful organization hunting the harried middle-aged protagonist all on full display, John Grisham's worldly novels have a way of making the average person feel somewhat mundane -- as if you're missing out on the bounty of corporate and political sleaziness that's out there. In \\"The Broker,\\" Grisham forgoes his usual narrative about the lawyer who works a hundred grueling hours a week and instead focuses on Joel Backman, a former money-grabbing lobbyist in Washington, D.C., who served six years in prison and is pardoned by the outgoing President of the United States. As is the case with many of Grisham's main characters, Backman was at one time rock-star rich, had an unbelievably busy job and lifestyle, ignored his family and went through multiple wives and women on the side. All in a day's work for the usual Grisham protagonist.<br /><br />In typical Grisham fashion, \\"The Broker\\" is grabbing from the outset. What's been less common within some of his recent books, however, is vibrant characters, interesting dialogue and engaging plots that don't feel rehashed many times over. Fortunately, \\"The Broker\\" is well done and should hold the attention of most Grisham fans. What sets the book apart from Grisham's usual mode of storytelling is a genuinely thorough description of the setting in Italy, where most of the book takes place. From beautiful cathedrals to endless coffee shops to Italian cuisine, language and culture, Grisham's knowledge and love of Italy is evident. At times, as poor Backman slaves to learn the Italian language with his tutors, you almost want to learn it with him. Character development and descriptive settings are not always strong suits of Grisham's writing, but in \\"The Broker\\" they're not half bad.<br /><br />No major twists occur in \\"The Broker,\\" but then, few usually do in a Grisham novel. Ironically, given that his bread and butter has always been suspenseful legal thrillers, many of Grisham's books actually come across as languidly paced, just like real life, and more like puzzles than all-out action dramas. Additionally, amid the cloak-and-dagger events that take place, there's usually a few lessons to be learned, which seem to be just as important for Grisham to convey. The author loathes corporate greed and dishonesty; often the humbled former millionaire main character has to learn this the hard way. But in the end, things usually work out just fine for the reformed protagonist, while the crooks who pursued him are quickly tossed aside. \\"The Broker\\" won't change your life, but it will entertain for several hours.his bread and butter has always been suspenseful legal thrillers, many of Grisham's books actually come across as languidly paced, just like real life, and more like puzzles than all-out action dramas.

You'd think this type of information was, one, correct and secondly specific in what buyers want to know. Whoever wrote up the product information failed on two counts here.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Seems like the whole world has forgotten about limp bizkit right?  Then how can a person explain over 1400 written customer reviews since the album came out.  Much can be said regarding the ratings of this album.  Some absolutely hate it and the die hard fans , some reviews 10 years later no less, are giving Limp Bizkit respect.  Im going to cut to the chase and give my opinion on this cd and then get back to the critics...    Significant Other is a break out cd for Limp Bizkit.  A common theme of the late 90s was to have an introduction that made an impression, with Sig Other's intro it gets into your head and leaves a feeling of familiarity/curiosity.  \\"Just like this\\" has great energy, the instrumentals are arranged like a whirlpool and the layering makes for an awesome build up, Fred takes it the direction it has to go.  \\"Nookie\\" is a song built on a very strong bass line with great supplementary sounds, the chorus is heavy and gives the lyrical context balls.  When \\"Break Stuff\\" dropped, everyone and their mother forgot about anger management, the line \\"and if my day keeps going this way i just might break your f--cking face tonight, give me something to break...about your f--cking face\\" is classic.  The melodic components combined with some complex lyrical delivery \\"Rearranged\\" makes for a great topical song, the bass line and guitar line create a synergy with a build up for the last chorus  that leaves nothing to be desired.      Every song on this album is an independent entity but what is amazing about this album is that every song comes together to create a great album.  The amount of support and participation Limp Bizkit receives from guys like Method Man, Jonathan Davis, Scott Weiland should indicate something about the momentum they carried and the strength of their sound.  The album is solid and I still listen to it to this day.    Regarding the hatred that people feel for Limp Bizkit \\"Fred cant write,\\" \\"the rest of the band has no talent,\\" \\"just as good as 17 magazine,\\" let me put it this way.  If you can not recognize the entertainment value of this cd it is because you are too stupid to recognize the de-marketing of the band at the time.  Every song on an album isn't going to be a landmark.  Limp Bizkit was a relative unknown riding on the success of \\"Faith,\\" the people/fan's expectations of LB were astronomical for their follow up and Limp Bizkit said \\"bring it on.\\"  They delivered a sensational, diverse, MULTI-PLATINUM album.  From there the industry was on notice and competing music companies/people who didn't like their sound tried to highlight the band's weaknesses and exploit them.  EVERY band has a downside, Zeppelin, Nirvana, Chili Peppers, Bob Marley, Beck, BRMC, Jay Z are all awesome artists but if im not feeling their sound they wont be listened to.  The same can be said for any band.  Limp Bizkit was so much a part of American culture that even Eminem name dropped Fred in \\"The Real Slim Shady.\\"      For everyone with a negative opinion, take it somewhere else.  People wouldn't be looking at this cd if they hated Limp Bizkit, they want a real opinion on the music, so i'm putting you guys on notice.      I really appreciated what Limp Bizkit did for the music industry, they were suppressing the strength/dominance of POP and opening up doors for so many other artists in the broad RockandRoll genres.  When the industry took them out, POP took control and rock has never been the same.  No one's forgotten about Limp Bizkit.    -Fernando
B00000G5WJ|5.0|I had this as a teenager on vinyl, and I just repurchased this on CD - great songs, although the lack of the rest of series songs (or the fact that only season 1 is on DVD) seems like a giant teaser for what hasn't been released.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|I knew from the moment I saw the first trailer for this movie that I would have to see it when it came out on Blu-ray (I don't go to the cinema anymore - I prefer the home theater experience). It's an understatement to say that I was NOT disappointed.    This movie is not only first class family fun the likes of which I would expect from Disney and Pixar, but is, in fact, also an extremely beautifully realized piece of science fiction. Everything from the ships to the bots to the way the humans' pampered lifestyle has led to their becoming fat and weak... it all comes together perfectly, managing to provoke more than a little thought as well as entertain.    I will watch this movie again and again. I can't believe CG has come this far, and I'm glad someone is using it to tell great stories like Wall-E.    Awesome stuff!
B001PJRAUS|1.0|Based on other reviews and the trailer, it appeared to be an affectionate modernizing of a beloved story.  Instead it was crass and crude and has little redeeming quality to it at all.  The \\"heroine\\" purports to adore Pride & Prejudice, and to have read it often, yet when she finds herself in that world, she makes it clear she learned nothing of manners and genteel behavior in all her readings of it.  She uncaringly bashes around making no effort not to shock or offend everyone around her as she heavy-handedly messes in everyone's lives without any thought to their feelings.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted and several times things happen \\"just because\\" but for no logical reason in the course of the story.  (Granted Elliott Cowan is very handsome soaking wet in a clinging shirt but it made absolutely no sense for it to happen and certainly not for him to agree to it as Darcy.)<br /><br />If you're absolutely desperate to see this, rent it.  Or better yet borrow it from some poor sap (like me) who actually bought it.  Mine?  It's going straight in the rubbish bin.  I'll certainly never give it a second viewing.

B0002GTWQA|4.0|Having read the novel before finally seeing this film in it's wide-screen format on DVD, I was expecting to be disappointed. Why?  Because it's very hard to capture Conrad's psychology of the main character, Jim, onto the big screen.  O'Toole comes very close in a very under-stated performance which ranks as one of his most under-rated in comparison to \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" where he was much more flamboyant.  Here he displays his angst and deep disgust at himself for failing at a crucial moment in his life.  Richard Brooks is not David Lean but he is still a very good director and he stages the battle scenes effectively plus utilizing the Super-Panavision scope very well (I did manage to see a rare but badly discolored 70mm print of this film in Hollywood).  Plus the supporting cast is superb with an excellent James Mason as the devious Mr Brown a standout.  If you like an epic action saga with a touch of psychology in it then do check out this film---they make it like they used to.

He was funny and quirky so I was curious about his novel, which he described as a modern \\"Lord of the Flies\\". It was a little slow moving until page 35, and then I couldn't put it down. I ate dinner with one utensil so I could hold the book in my other hand. I stayed up till 3:30am to finish it. Now I'm looking forward to reading his eariler books.

0312330537|2.0|I'm amazed that I was able to make it through this entire book; initially I didn't think I would make it through the first few pages (I skipped them, because they were so stupid that I knew I would not make it to the story if I didn't do so).     I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewer who called this \\"atrociously written, self-aggrandizing garbage.\\" There are so many reasons to dislike this author - he's a criminal who apparently thinks he should be lauded for escaping prison; given the chance to start anew, he again chooses a life of crime; worst, he thinks his inane philosophical conversations were so incredibly profound that they all bore writing down and passing on to others. You know those super-irritating people who, when drunk, start babbling philosophy, thinking they sound awesomely smart? He and his buddies were a big group of those people, and he actually WROTE DOWN all those conversations and put them in the book! It's disgusting.    More importantly, when he's not doing straight narrative, his attempts at being poetic are painful. His similes and metaphors almost unfailingly defy logic. One that stands out in my mind was something akin to \\"her lips were swollen like grapes in the sun.\\" Pardon me, but grapes + sun = raisins, am I wrong? I found myself stopping dead at these painful gaps in logic so often that, between these and the horrible philosophical drivel, eventually I realized I had to skip over anything that wasn't narrative/dialog.    All that said, the narrative part is, at least, an interesting story. I suspect that's why everyone thinks it's such a great book. I think a set of experiences like these did bear retelling, and that's why it gets 2 stars instead of one.    Unfortunately, there's no redemption in this tale. Rather than learning lessons, the author continues to be a criminal and an addict, and, when sent back to prison, it seems he wrote this book to brag about it all. His inflated sense of self-importance is so distasteful that it really taints the whole thing.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|Disappointing.  After \\"Girl in the other room\\" which had some truly memorable tracks including a fantastic Joni Mitchell cover, this was a big let down. The vocals are bland except on \\"Walk on by\\" and the arrangements are too predictable and unexciting.  A very uninspired effort (sounds like she's just bored and marking time) from an otherwise great artist.
0756405890|5.0|Thanks all for rocking the reviews! Pat and I grew up together and he'd never do anything dishonest. This is by far one of the best fantasy novels I have read and I knew it from the minute I started reading. Kvothe is the best character ever to grace the insides of a book. The other characters are believable too and the storyline is the most original I've found in my life. The world is incredibly diverse and detailed, rivaled only by Tolkien's Middle Earth. When Pat gave me this book, I couldn't do anything else for days. I read it three times in a row that's how much I loved it.
B000WCDI64|5.0|For anyone who is an Amy Winehouse fan this is definately something you'll want to add to your collection!!! This live performance is outstanding, I absolutely loved every minute of it.  It even includes a documentary on Amy with interviews of herself her father, and others. I would definately tell anyone who likes Amy or her music to purchase this.  (And no, she is not spaced out on drugs through this, maybe alittle tipsy, but not enough to impede her singing) Definately add this to your DVD library.
B00006CXGH|1.0|Fortunately, I borrowed this DVD from my local library.  I like Sidney Poitier and saw River Phoenix in \\"The Mosquito Coast\\" years ago, so I thought the teaming of the two actors would be wonderful.  I like stories of espionage and intrigue as well.  This film, however, was a huge disappointment.  I wasn't for one moment convinced that Jeff's parents were Russian spies, that Sidney Poitier was an FBI agent or that the older Russian guy was a real threat. In addition, River Phoenix's character isn't very likable and it's so obvious that River Phoenix is acting.  The plot is choppy and there are very few suspenseful scenes or thrills (I don't consider a car chase scene a thrill).  Not recommended at all.
1415743762|5.0|[[ASIN:B001EO748M The Tudors - The Complete Second Season]]    I'm sure historians will frown on The Tudors but I love it. This series really bring the characters to life. It made me want to know more about Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk and Henry's sister Margaret. I've seen various Henry VIII films. In The Tudors one minute I'm scare of Henry VIII, the next I'm feeling sorry for him.If Henry VIII knew Elizabeth would be one of the greatest monarchs England has ever had, Queen Anne might not have lost her head!! I totally love the depth of Katherine of Aragon. A must see!!
B001ECQ4HG|3.0|The picture on the Blu-ray edition is soft and flat compared to many recent movies.  That might just be the way this movie looks (I didn't see it in the theater), but don't expect to be dazzled by the PQ on this BD.  The movie itself is great, with an unbelievable cast, clever dialogue and memorable characters (particularly Gary Oldman's).  If you don't already own the DVD, this Blu-ray edition is highly recommended.  If you're considering a double dip, though, you might want to rent it first or check some reviews.

B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|The image quality is very poor. I have seen a much better image quality in regular dvds that this bluray. definitely not woth the money.<br /><br />I mena, the whole idea of buying a bluray is to get the best in image quality, the full HD. Stay away from this item.
0679731725|5.0|If you've ever wanted a complete manual on how to maintain discipline and composure under extreme duress and adversity, then this is the book for you. Additionally, if you've been looking for the best novel ever written about repressed butlers, then look no further.    Stevens, an old-school British butler, strives to be the utmost professional and dignified butler possible, and he does it successfully  by pushing aside such parasitic emotions as love and loneliness. What do you expect from a man who is motivated by a story in which a butler calmly shoots an escaped tiger threatening his master? I found Stevens to be worthy of our admiration: here is a man who maintains his composure and executes his duties even while his personal life decays before his eyes. Sure, his basic humanity may betray him sometimes, e.g. he cries occasionally from the extreme stress, but that is only the weak part of him dying. He instead sucks it up and does his job. We should all follow his example.    The secondary plotline of the story is that Stevens follows his Nazi-sympathetic master, Lord Darlington. Now that is something I cannot willfully condone.    The writing is beautiful and precise. The author writes from Stevens' point of view, and we learn of his crying and sadness only indirectly through other characters' statements. The whole narrative is carefully controlled and presented.    Highly recommended book.
0307387178|4.0|Jon Krakauer's books are well written and researched. In Into the Wild, he has taken a  complex true journey and handled it in a straight forward, thoughtful way. One is drawn into the story and held by  suspense and a need to determine the psychological make-up and motivation of the subject. In the end, we are enriched by practical information and the sense that we too have made a journey of sorts.
0316168815|3.0|spoiler....<br />I thought this book fell short of what it could have been.  I was interested when I heard about this book that was from the perspective of the victim. I felt that the autor jumped around too much and was under-developed.  The autor made the reader believe that the \\"bad guy\\" was going to get caught in the end, or that the body of the victim was going to be found, but in the end neither happened. Why develop the story this way and then not finish it? Furthermore, the part where Susie takes over Ruth's body and has sex with her first love was totally out of place in the book.  Instead of going to her family and giving them some closer by telling them the truth about what happened to her, she has sex?  I did not hate this book, and I am happy to have read it, but it fell short for me.  I think I fell in love with the idea that the book was written from a different perspective, but it could have been so much better
0393061310|2.0|Quick background on me - history degree, extensive reading on ancient civilizations, definite interest in the subject matter regarding this book.  This was not a required reading for me - I actually enjoy reading these sort of things on my free time.<br /><br />That being said, this book was a -chore- to read.<br /><br />Diamond really has some strong points in this book, and the fact that this text has swept through quite a few universities demonstrates how thought provoking and influential it has become.  I have absolutely no doubt that the author is an expert in his field and that the information provided in this book opens up a new paradigm on the balance of power that originated early in written history that resulted in the dominance of Eurasian culture across the globe.  However, my main beef with this book as that the arguments he presented could have been put in a book about a 5th of this size.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />Diamonds main arguments for the predominance of Eurasian culture are as follows -<br /><br />1)  Eurasia had the climate and natural resources to produce lots of food, domesticated animals, and the agricultural base that is a necessary step towards a society that allows for things like a formal government, a free-standing military, and technological advances.  The Americas, Australia, and Africa does not.<br /><br />2)  Because of Eurasia is laid out, food, technology, and ideas are quick to spread (east to west across relatively open areas with similar climates compared to the vast difference of climates of the more north/south aligned Americas/Africa).  These things were shared between the cultures and instituted unified governments that were more of a match than the isolated tribes of the less-fortunate continents.<br /><br />3)  Greater food production allowed for bigger populations, which gave more ample opportunity for diseases to develop (which also happen to generally come from domesticated animals, which the bigger populations of Eurasia had in abundance) - the populations developed resistance to said diseases, and thus had \\"outgunned\\" the smaller tribes when it came to germs, leading a massive advantage when it came to colonization.<br /><br />There are a few more details introduced in the book (the importance of writing being developed, allowing for the transfer of ideas - governments allowing for the development of religious systems/patriotism which caused soldiers to fight harder than tribal equivalents), but that's pretty much the summary of Diamonds arguments.  Great points, really interesting, but believe me when I say that I just saved you a very long, repetitive read by giving away the meat of this book.  Towards the end (I'd say the last 20% of the book not including epilogue/afterword), Diamond refers to these ideas over and over, to the point where it seems like he's really beating a dead horse and not introducing anything new to his arguments.  This issue paired with the fact that he drowns his writing in statistics that would be better and more efficiently served in a footnote format, plus his long tirades on related but not necessarily essential topics, make it agonizing to pull the valuable insight that he presents in his arguments.  How does the origin of language groups matter towards the essential argument of the book?  That information would have been better suited in a more focused book on the different tribes of New Guinea and Indonesia, not in a book that is heralded as an argumentative thesis as to the nature of Eurasian dominance in the world.<br /><br />To give an example of a much better written book that argues a very controversial point, I'd refer the potential customer to Dawkin's \\"The Selfish Gene\\".  Every chapter in that book demonstrates an argument to support his thesis, is very streamlined and to the point, and does not go off on long tirades of related yet irrelevant subject matter.  It's pretty much the antithesis of how GGS is written.<br /><br />Again, valuable information in this book, very thought provoking, but just too damn long and rambling.  My .02 .too damn long and rambling.  My .02 .

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Pixar has made many fine films over the years - all entertaining, all clever, and all heartwarming. But this one stands a cut above the rest - not just for the central character, the undeniably adorable WALL-E, but for the message.<br /><br />WALL-E is a post-apocalypse romance set in the far future. A lone mobile trash compactor (WALL-E),who is all that is left of \\"civilization\\" (as we know it), falls in love with an Extraterrestrial Vegetation detector (EVE). Yes, it's Adam and Eve, only in robot form. And the Garden of Eden, our beautiful Earth, is a sea of trash. The point couldn't be made more clearly. Humans have finally trashed the planet so badly that it has become an uninhabitable mess, incapable of sustaining life.<br /><br />The point is well taken, and needs to be made. However, where the movie started falling apart for me was when WALL-E follows his sweetheart back to the spaceship that has become home to the fat, pampered survivors of the Earth's demise. There was nothing to suggest that these people were capable of changing the attitudes which had destroyed their home world in the first place. If anything their lives in space had accentuated their wastefulness and complacency. (Just witness the huge amount of trash the ship's inhabitants jettisoned into space.) While it is imperative that a Disney film end on an optimistic note, I couldn't help but feel their return to Earth (We'll grow pizza plants!)was a tragedy. Sad to say, the idea that we can somehow return to Eden with a little well-meaning effort may be just as far-fetched as this lovely Pixar film.
B001I82RVS|5.0|You know, I have a bit of an idea what this film was about, but my clear head to that sort of thing has been drowned repeatedly in the gallons upon gallons of blood that was flashed in front of my face in some of the most startling groteseque imagery I've ever seen.<br /><br />TOKYO GORE POLICE is a masterpiece in its distortion of the human body, and an epic in its destruction of that body. It put whole new vulgar thoughts in my head, and I'm just left in awe of that.<br /><br />On top of that, it's unnervingly relentless in its presentation. If you go longer than a minute without seeing something bizarre and revolting, it's because you've closed your eyes.<br /><br />Really, it's just gross. All the way through. And in fantastic new ways.<br /><br />If you like gore and insanity you've absolutely got to see this. If you like story -- well, TOKYO GORE POLICE has one. And um. It's about people mutilating themselves. There's more to it than that, I'm sure, and the fuzzy image I have in my head doesn't make it out to be utter garbage, but I was too giddy with childish delight at the violence to notice.<br /><br />If you're not into gorefests you probably should skip anything with GORE right there in the title to begin with, but TOKYO GORE POLICE is an especially large SKIP for you.
B0013FSXT6|1.0|I just received this movie, and I can say that this is by far the most \\"Noisiest bluray\\" I've ever seen, I really doubt the movie is on 1080p, I think is barely 720p. The sound pcm 5.1 is really good, I hope to find in the future a new release of this great film with a real \\"pristine video quality\\"
B001AZIRZY|4.0|I got this from my public library because I'd never heard of it (well, I know the radio show, but I'm not a regular listener.)    I watched the first disc (5 episodes so far) and I'm going to give it 4 stars. It's actually pretty good, there is a lot of subtle (and not so subtle) political and other adult humor. As one reviewer mentioned, there are lots of little references to products and people; it's quite entertaining if you catch these.    OK, I'll admit the writing is weak in some cases, some sections are pretty dull or degrade to \\"potty humor.\\" As for the criticism of animation, I didn't see that. I thought the animation was fine. After all, a show like South Park got it's fame from what looked like simple amateur animation.    As for the content, this show is more like South Park than the Simpsons or other prime-time animation. The successful prime-time shows have a balance of jokes and images which try to aim for both children and adults. Actually, I think children would find this show mostly boring. I don't think there's anything wrong with kids watching it, I just don't think they'd get the concepts (political fundraising corruption, outsourcing, etc.) And unlike the Simpsons, there's not a family of little kids or pets to give them something to find entertaining. And there are great adult references like a mention of a bottle of Lagavulin 1928 they found in the city politician's campaign-funded limo. If you know single-malt, you gotta like that reference.    So I'm really glad I watched this. I've actually ordered the set from an Amazon Marketplace seller, because I think I'll enjoy it again and also share it with my brother-in-law who works on cars, listens to click and clack, and I know he'll enjoy the humor.    Finally, please note that some of the reviewers gave this show bad reviews after watching one or two episodes, and this really isn't valid. It's like giving an album a bad review after listening to the first song, or leaving a restaurant becauseyou didn't like the appetizer. If you get to the 5th show, about \\"Gigantic Motors,\\" I thought it was great to tackle this topic -- The big motor company with the big rich and foolish executives continuing to make bad decisions and force their mega-vehicles (\\"The Compensator,\\" -- I love it) onto a public that didn't want or need them. (\\"This year's model gets 50% better mileage than the last one. .. which got 1 mile-per-gallon. This one gets 1.5, that's a 50% improvement!) This is particularly funny (well, actually, not) because of all the billions of taxpayer money we've since been forced to spend to fund these guys, which, by the way, still flew to Washington DC in their own corporate jets as there were going to ask for bailout money. Another one on outsourcing was particularly good, too (\\"Welcome to India, may I take your jobs? heh heh just a joke\\")  OK, so one reason people might not find this show that funny is that it tackles subjects that are very real, current, and need to be dealt with, and maybe this show is one way to make us realize that!

B0015OKWL2|4.0|Third time for Alpacino and Deniro together, which always makes a good movie!     First the Godfather, then Heat, and now Righteous Kill that has both Robert Deniro and Alpacino together.      Deniro and Alpacino are two homicide detectives that are nearing retirement. They are asked to investigate into serial killings of ex-convicts who escaped punishment due to cracks in the judicial system. As a result this killer wipes them off the streets.     Throughout the movie we watch a recorded tape of Deniro confessing his murders that try to make you think he is the mysterious killer, only for us to discover in the end that he is not.      Quite interesting movie. I just knew it all along that Deniro was not the killer. I thought there must be a twist in the end because it was too easy and direct. It came out to be the case afterall.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started doing these workouts at the end of April (I've done 2-3 workouts a week vs. doing it everyday) and in a month I lost over 3 INCHES off my waist, my stamina has improved greatly, and I can see definition in my body that I haven't seen in years.    I must say though, these aren't for those who feel a little pain then quit.  I didn't consider myself very out of shape, but after the first session on level one I couldn't walk straight for 6 days, but I felt amazing knowing that I had done it.    Honestly, I've only done level one and two workouts and I've mixed them a bit along with doing some road biking (about 20-30 miles a week), but everytime I do a workout I feel AMAZING!  I've recommended this to everyone I work with and my own family.  Just stick with it and you'll feel and see results in no time!
0201721481|4.0|C++ Primer - Fourth Edition has a really effective way of teaching you the C++ programming language-full detail of what every bit of code does. Have you ever looked at C++ code and had no idea what all of it meant? This book will teach you every single bit of what that code does.<br /><br />The book is laid out in approximately 17 different chapters which are then divided into an average of 9-15 sections. Each chapter is focused on one key subject such as the begining steps and more advanced techniques to use your code. Within those chapters you have each section slowly explaining in detail what each bit of code you're seeing is doing.<br /><br />Now as I've said before, this book explains every bit of code in detail, but this doesn't mean that this book isn't for just beginners. The books cover states that over 48,000 programmers have learned the coding language from beginners to more advanced.<br /><br />About every other page contains tips and secrets to successful coding which stand out in gray boxes. Some of the most smallest things are mentioned here such as how comments work in your code to how your code should be formatted. These tips will help you inprove your coding habits very much.<br /><br />Now you're probably thinking, \\"This is just another one of those reviews which show each good part of the book. It's not like they're going to give me any info on weak parts of the book!\\", Well in fact you're wrong. This book isn't all positive. There's some parts in this book which can be very annoying such as lacking a glossary of needed terms even though most terms are put in bold print. There are very good examples of code in this book, but not all of them are the most interesting. Reading this book can be very monotonous at times because of the lack of different things they mention you can code or give you examples of code.<br /><br />How about the strong points? In depth explanations, great examples, great tips, need I say more? This book has a lot of good points to it, there are very few weak points. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a good C++ reference manual.

B001FB55MG|5.0|Another Fantastic Disney Movie.  Not only for children but Adults will like it as well.
B001KVZ6F2|3.0|This is a somewhat interesting movie, although a little too pat in places. It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.    Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.    There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.    But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.    There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.     With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.
B0020H47EQ|3.0|Author Jack Engelhard wrote a political/romantic and dramatic novel about a Jewish family in hard times and a billionaire Arab who offers a million dollars to sleep with the wife.  A film that delves deep into Arab-Israeli conflict.  The rights for the novel was purchased but the film adaption would be closer to home for the US and changed to relate to American audiences.<br /><br />Directing the film would be Adrian Lyne (\\"Flash Dance\\", \\"Fatal Attraction\\", \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and \\"Unfaithful\\") and the screenplay for the film was written by Amy Holden Jones (\\"Beethoven\\", \\"Mystic Pizza\\" and \\"The Relic\\")  and produced by Sherry Lansing (\\"Fatal Attraction\\", \\"The Accused\\" and \\"Black Rain\\").  \\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" was successful at the box office as it brought in over $266 million worldwide despite its negative reviews and even winning the Golden Raspberry Awards for \\"Worst Picture\\", \\"Worst Screenplay\\" and \\"Worst Supporting Actor\\".<br /><br />The film is about David (Woody Harrelson) and Diana Murphy (Demi Moore), a couple that have been in love since they were teenagers and very much in love as adults.  David is an architect and Diana is a real estate agent and for Diana, she wanted David to pursue his dream of building their home near the beach.<br /><br />The couple move forward and have their dream home built but then the market crashed, America was in a recession, Diana was not able to sell any new homes on the market and David lost his job due to budget cuts.  Behind in bills and needing to pay $50,000 on the home they just built, decide to borrow $5,000 and gamble and hope to win money in Las Vegas.<br /><br />On the first night there, they do just that.  David is able to win up to $25,000 and while he gambles, Diana goes through elegant shops at the Hilton and looks at a few dresses and wonders how she would look in one of them.  John Gage (Robert Redford) who sees the young woman is fascinated and offers to buy the dress for her but Diana shoots back that the dress is for sale, not her.<br /><br />As the Murphy's celebrate the night with romantic, passionate love with their money scattered all around them, they start betting it all over again but this time, no results.  David and Diana lose all of their money.<br /><br />While walking through the casino, David sees John Gage and learns that he is a billionaire and bets $10,000 per gold chip when he gambles.  John sees David and Diana so happy but he asks if Diana could join him quick to give his next game good luck. And this time, betting a million dollars.  David roots for his wife and Diana reluctantly goes to John and blows a kiss to the dice and Gage wins.<br /><br />In support of Diana for helping him out, he offers a room at the posh hotel and everything on the house on him.  While checking out the room, Diana gets the black dress she was trying out the day before as a gift and both are invited to a party.<br /><br />While alone, John offers a hypothetical question to David.  If people can be bought for a million dollars.  In this case, what if he offered a million dollars to the couple for one night with his wife.  Both Murphy's say they would tell the person to \\"go to hell\\".<br /><br />But John is serious.  He makes his offer and tells them for one night with his wife, they would be set for life with a million dollars.<br /><br />During the night, both David and Diana agonize over the situation.  One night, one million dollars and they can eliminate their problems.  So, the two decide to do it.<br /><br />But what are the ramifications to agreeing to such an indecent proposal?<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" gets its first treatment on High Definition with a 1080p transfer on Blu-ray.  First, the good news.  The good news is that certain scenes that incorporate the outdoors and sunlight look great and vibrant.  There are some low-light scenes where blacks are deep and picture quality looks quite nice.  Now, the bad news.  Those scenes are just afew, \\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" has probably one of the worst high grain I have seen on a film on Blu-ray.  There is one scene where Diana is teaching English to a class and the scene is so full of grain that she nearly becomes hard to see at one point.  During the opening scene, with David sitting down near the beach and you see fog all around, high level of grain and color banding.  Not sure if the Las Vegas scenes were stock but those were quite grainy as well. Some scenes looks as if it was muted by digital noise reduction (DNR) and so some scenes look quite soft.<br /><br />Overall, good and bad quality is all over the place.  Some scenes are great but some scenes are absolutely terrible.  The positive factor is that the scenes don't last that long but I don't think I've seen picture quality this uneven for a Blu-ray release.<br /><br />As for audio, the film gets an English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD transfer (French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  This film's soundtrack is front channel driven. Dialogue is clear and understandable which is important.  When there is music, John Barry's (\\"Madagascar\\" 1 & 2, \\"Chaplin\\", \\"Peggy Sue Got Married\\", \\"The Cotton Club\\") musical score does come alive and actually, really enjoyed the musical score.  But this is not a film to expect any rear sound or subwoofer usage.<br /><br />The casino scenes which are filled with people and sounds of the casino which I was hoping to hear come alive through my speaker system, was just average.  I was hoping to hear the ambient noises all around me but it seems that everything was front channel driven.  There is a brief scene with the rain pouring down, which sounded quite nice from the front channels but overall, this is a dialogue driven film.<br /><br />Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" features commentary by Director Adrian Lyne.  The commentary was done for the 2003 DVD release and Adrian sharing his thoughts on the making of the film, from the love making scenes to how Las Vegas has changed since filming the movie and interesting enough, confesses that there are many things he disliked about the movie but did enjoy the performance of Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore.  But this is a commentary that is filled with long pauses at times.  But Adrian Lyne is a director who is known to tell audiences on his audio commentary that he has a bad memory and will do his best to remember things.  If it was this difficult ten years later, perhaps I'm glad that he didn't do a revised commentary 16 years later.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" was an interested film when released in 1993.  These were the times when \\"Lifestyles and the Rich and Famous\\"  and \\"Fresh Prince of Bel-Aire\\" was on television, \\"Pretty Woman\\" was a successful rags-to-riches film, magazines showcasing the glitz of their metropolitan cities,  the glitz of big business were at its high point and people just delved into wanting to know the lifestyles of the rich and people knew the names of the top supermodels of the time.<br /><br />When the film came out, critics felt the notion that the rich would take advantage with those in financial need was preposterous. But compared today where America is in hard economic times, I sometimes wonder if this film would have done better today than in 1993.  Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if these situations happen frequently in the world.  Also, it would have been interesting if the film were adapted today would be an exact adaption focusing on the Arab-Israeli conflict.<br /><br />But if there was one fault of the film, was this portrayal of a perfect couple hitting hard financial times and the character of David just going a little overboard that his wife had sex with another man.  Afterall, he did agree to it but then he decided not to and it's too late.  Share some of the blame, it was a joint decision and why he takes everything out all on her is just a bit too much.<br /><br />I felt that Demi Moore was just enjoyable to watch and she did a wonderful job with her character.  Robert Redford was absolutely suave and for Woody Harrelson, at the time, it showed us that the actor had more to give than what we saw of him on the television show \\"Cheers\\".<br /><br />If anything, I was a bit put off by the uneven picture quality of this film.  Some scenes were just downright ugly and makes me want to go back to the DVD to see if it was that bad or the Blu-ray 1080p HD Transfer just elevated the grain.  \\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" was not the prettiest transfer I was hoping to see on Blu-ray and the lack of any special features but a commentary was a bit disappointing.<br /><br />In the end, I did enjoy the film and considering the time the film was released.  Was it really preposterous for a financially strapped couple to accept such an indecent proposal?  Especially compared to another popular film where a multi-millionaire would hire a prostitute to be with him for a week?  Probably not.<br /><br />Overall, \\"INDECENT PROPOSAL\\" was an enjoyable film that probably makes better sense now that the country is in an economic recession and people watching it again will probably find how powerful of a film it is now than what it was back in 1993.at there are many things he disliked about the movie but did enjoy the performance of Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|The original version of this story remains a film classic, with memorable writing, direction and legendary performances by Norma Shearer, Roz Russell, Mary Boland, Joan Fontaine, Virginia Weidler (at one point Doris Day's sister-in-law), Paulette Goddard and most notably Joan Crawford.  That version was witty, wise, bitchy, mean and sympathetic, fast-paced, fun and sophisticated.  This version is appalling.  This a story which relies on chemistry among the actors above all in this remake the chemistry is zero.  Everyone seems to be reciting the script self-consciously, there is not a moment when there's any sense we are watching real life, everything seems calculated and over-rehearsed.  It's like a bad community production.  How all this happened given the talents of Diane English and everyone else involved is beyond me.  Even foolproof Bette Midler and Candace Bergen seem to be repeating themselves with no spark. Only Cloris Leachman emerges unscathed.  Actually, there seems to be no movie here, just a parade of scenes on movie sets.  Thank God Hedda Hopper will never see it.

Better helps you understand and build on your strengths in life and helps you better understand other people's strengths and how to best work with them.  Helpful in any work situation or even in personal relationships.  I'd recommend this book.

B000001EGA|5.0|This album is a series of songs about the sixties, beginning when Elton and Bernie first met and ending when Elton's first album, Empty sky, was released. As such, it is likely to be best appreciated by those who are familiar with the story behind the songs, but as most people who listen to this album don't know the men personally and haven't read any biographies about Elton (and I'm not sure how much those biographies say about the period in question anyway, since I haven`t yet read any of them), the music here has to stand on its own merit.<br /><br />The CD booklet, like the original vinyl album insert, contains lyrics for Dogs in the kitchen, a song attacking music industry bosses that never appeared on the original album. Apparently, Elton never recorded the song, but thought that merely including the lyrics in the booklet was sufficient to make his point.<br /><br />The songs that actually made up the original album are presented in the order in which the events that inspired them occurred. The title track introduces thee two main characters, these being Captain Fantastic (Elton) and the brown dirt cowboy (Bernie). Subsequent tracks show some of the resentment that Elton and Bernie felt about the moguls who controlled the music business. This is particularly evident on Bitter fingers, which explains that it is hard to simply write songs to order, especially if you're told what kind of song is required. Away from the music business itself, other songs tell of life growing up as young men in the sixties, a good example being Tell me when the whistle blows.<br /><br />The only single released from the original album was Someone saved my life tonight, which made the top ten in America but didn't do so well in Britain, where it just messed the top twenty. Two other singles appear on this re-release as bonus tracks, together with one of their B-sides. Lucy in the sky with diamonds, a cover of the Beatles classic, should be instantly recognizable. Although it doesn't say so in the liner notes, I think this was recorded for a Beatles tribute album (All this and world war two) . In any case, it was a hugely successful single, become an American number one and British top ten hit. The other A-side single presented here as a bonus track, Philadelphia freedom, , also topped the American singles chart but just missed the British top ten. The interesting fact about this song is that Elton and Bernie wrote it following a request by Billie Jean King, the famous tennis player, for a theme song for her team.<br /><br />This isn't the most accessible Elton John album. It takes a few plays to get into, but it is a fascinating album and is further strengthened by the bonus tracks. Serious Elton John fans definitely need this album.es, I think this was recorded for a Beatles tribute album (All this and world war two) .

B0026OE2O8|5.0|It's too late... to be a pessimist.<br /><br />\\"HOME\\" is a film directed by Award-winning aerial photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand.  Yann has been active in covering the world beginning with his Altitude Agency which he formed in 1991, an agency which was the first of its kind to specialize in aerial photography and in 1994 he captured the world from above and its beauty in the book \\"Earth from Above\\" which became a best seller in many countries.<br /><br />But Yann is also known for his involvement with Ecology and he is the founder of GoodPlanet, helping companies and people with reforestation and practicing energy efficiency.  He is a well-respected man known for his work on public environmental awareness and most recently, the world became familiar with his work from his film \\"HOME\\".<br /><br />The story of the creation of \\"HOME\\" is quite interesting.  In 2007, he began his new documentary project originally known as \\"Boomerang\\" which then became known a \\"HOME\\".  Produced by well-known film director/producer Luc Besson and financed by the PPR group, \\"HOME\\" was created.  In a way, the documentary was Yann's way of showing the world of what kind of state our planet is in.  That the beauty that we see, can all be gone within the next decade(s) due to man's needs and rapidly depleting natural resources.<br /><br />In order to have the film shown worldwide, Yann gave up his rights to the film and it was shown on the video streaming site \\"YouTube\\" on June 4, 2009 and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 5th.<br /><br />The film spanned 54 countries and 120 locations covering the most amazing landscapes of the planet.  Narrated by actress Glenn Close, the film starts off with showing us the beauty of the planet.  From the volcanoes, the rivers, the ice and water that flow through the world.  Then the beautiful rain forests and then the animals that reside on the planet.<br /><br />But unlike other well-done documentaries on nature that focus solely on a planet's beautiful surroundings and the animal interaction and its importance in the food chain, \\"HOME\\" shows those things but immediately switches gears to show us the how our planet is in trouble and to best illustrate the trouble, showing various civilizations who are now in trouble or are facing major crisis.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"HOME\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ration of 1:78:1) and is featured on a 25-GB single layer Blu-ray disc (AVC @ 21  MBPS).  If you thought \\"Planet Earth\\" looked absolutely incredible, \\"HOME\\" is magnificent to watch and the imagery is absolutely breathtaking.<br /><br />Words can not describe the imagery captured on film.  From above a volcano, to high above the algae covering the oceans, the farm lands across the world, the deserts, the ice, the people, the animals from high above.  But then you see the destruction of trees and areas that were once full of water, now having depleted their water resource.  You will be in awe of the cinematography but shocked about how civilizations have depleted their natural resource that lands that were once full of trees are now barren.  Nothing has grown back.  Just shocking!<br /><br />As for audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (and also French 5.1 Dolby Digital).  Glenn Close narrates the film and can be heard clearly.  But there are scenes where you hear water rushing and you can hear your subwoofer being utilized as the rumbles are captured.  Also, above many civilizations that are packed with people, you can hear them from way above and those crowd noises are captured quite well.  The audio compliments the overall video imagery and is what I expected from a documentary.<br /><br />As for subtitles, English SDH is offered.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are no special features on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I absolutely loved \\"HOME\\".  I was surprised how the film started out showing us thebeauty of the planet.  The cinematography was excellent but 30-minutes into the film, I was asking myself...is this all about the beauty of the planet?  Having watched \\"Planet Earth\\" on Blu-ray and various nature based documentaries, I was thinking that perhaps that \\"HOME\\" was no different from the others.  Beautiful cinematography but I was hoping for something more.<br /><br />Well, the film suddenly switches gears and then shows us the man-made destruction of the planet.  I was immediately captivated by the images of lands that have had their forests eliminated, then to see lands that were once full of water now seeing their water levels much lower than ever.  Image after image of civilizations who have depended on their natural resources now having depleted them.  From the fish to the water.<br /><br />I was absolutely in awe.  I never knew other countries had it this bad.  And to know that because they have used up their natural resources, there is a chance that they will become refugees in their country.  But shocking are images of people living amongst their trash, people who are living in poor impoverished areas but built right next to them are these big multi-billion dollar oil corporations.<br /><br />We learn of Easter Island's Rapa Nui tribe, well known for the Moai (statues) but also well-known for how this tribe destroyed its forests and how habitat destruction has led to soil problems, then water problems and overall collapse on civilization, nearly wiping everyone out.  Of course, Easter Island's conflicts have been documented by travelers who have visited the area when it was lush and full of life and now, all life is nearly all gone from that region.<br /><br />There are many images that I would never have expected to see captured on film and that imagery is all captured in \\"HOME\\".<br /><br />\\"HOME\\" is a magnificent documentary that opened my eyes to the world.  Director Yann Arthus-Bertrand and the whole crew must be commended for such risky, challenging but also beautiful work of covering 54 countries and 120 locations.  It's one thing to capture beauty but to capture the destruction by man.  In fact, on the back of the Blu-ray case, you learn that the producers will donate their film's profits back to Goodplanet.org.  Even the packaging is ecologically friendly and made with 30% recycled paper and bio-based inks.<br /><br />Needless to say, after watching \\"HOME\\", my eyes have opened up to the world.  There are many things we have read or heard about on the news but now we have visual evidence that is made available to the world of how things are getting worse and that we need to change our ways before its too late.  Because of technology, we are now rapidly exceeding our planets resources.  And already, civilizations are or will soon go through catastrophic situations never seen before.  This documentary is indeed an eye-opener.<br /><br />\\"HOME\\" is breathtakingly brilliant on Blu-ray with awesome picture quality but as much as the visuals are impressive and vibrant.  It's one of those documentaries that you hope everyone gives it a chance and the time to watch and see for themselves and so they will know what is going on in the world.  I don't think many have a clue how our planet has changed within the last 50 years and its pretty sad.<br /><br />There is literally so much visually to take in but I wouldn't mind watching this documentary repeatedly because the amount of footage and what you are able to see is outstanding. Again, I am very impressed with this release.<br /><br />If there was one nitpick I have with this Blu-ray release is that with the message delivered from the film, I wish there would be some form of special features included.  May it be pointing people to directions of websites that they can get involved in and even a featurette on the making of \\"HOME\\".  Anything extra would have been nice.  But I understand that the focus and the message the filmmakers wanted people to see, is what people will take from the film after watching it.  Again, \\"HOME\\" is simply magnificent and is truly an eye-opener and this is probably one of the rare occasions where a Blu-release was barebones in special features content but still receive my highest recommendation.<br /><br />\\"HOME\\" is a documentary that I wholeheartedly recommend.

B00192IV0O|5.0|I love this CD!  If you are a fan of the Black Eyed Peas music you will not be disappointed by this new album.  I've always loved the BEP's because their music makes me want to get up dance and it's always funky.  I personally do not listen to a lot of mainstream music. I prefer EDM like House, breaks, drum and bass and trance.  The BEP's are one of the few popular groups I love.      This album has fresh electronic vibe and Will.I.AM has done another great job producing the tracks-they sound great!!! If you like to dance you'll love it.  Boom Boom Pow reminded my of old school breaks/ rollorskating music from my youth in the 80's.  Rock That Body is very electro housey which I love.  I've enjoyed all the tracks on this album very much.       Don't listen to the negative reviews out there this is a fantastic album!!!  One of the earlier reviews called the sound bubble gum sounding.  Honestly-do all people that hear a dance track have to call it bubble gummy?  There is a BIG difference between good dance music and a bubble gum sound and this album belongs to the former.  I think they don't get what the Black Eyed Peas are trying to achieve at all.  I thought this album was quite evolved compared to most of the crap they play on the radio these days. If you don't get the sound that's cool. I don't look for 'messages' or rely on on CD's as public service announcements. It has to have a good beat and make me want to get up and shake it...
B00008BXJJ|5.0|Endless joy! This is live rock 'n roll in all its glory. AC DC has got to be the greatest live act on the planet. Angus Young's soaring guitar play is simply awesome!
0399230033|2.0|All right, I'm giving this two stars because my kids seem to like it, but it is, in my opinion, a thoroughly one-star-or-less book.<br /><br />It is incredibly lame.  The pictures are simplistic and not very well-drawn, and the story is nonsensical bordering on retarded-and-troubling.<br /><br />And I can handle nonsensical, in fact I think some of the best kids books recognize the sort of bizarre dream state that childhood is and use that to tell engaging narratives that dance happily past logic and convention to make kids laugh and wonder.  See for instance most of the gently hallucinogenic tightrope walk over the Gulf of Madness that is the collective canon of Margaret Wise Brown.  That stuff makes NO sense--COLOR KITTENS, LITTLE FUR FAMILY, and that one about the talking island--but it's all lyrical to the point of being beautiful, and it's fun.<br /><br />GOOD NIGHT, GORILLA, on the other hand...ugh...man...I really, really hate this book.  Seriously.  I have two young kids, and as I said, they like this for some reason and ask me to read it to them all the time.<br /><br />AND IT SUUUUUUUUUUUUCKS.  Oh wow does it suck.<br /><br />First of all there are almost no words, so you can't just shift into autopilot and read the wretched thing without thinking.  You've got to narrate the damn thing, and since its story is mindless and its pictures are unexciting, well, here ya go, have fun.<br /><br />GOOD NIGHT, GORILLA tells the story of a zookeeper named Joe who goes around checking on the zoo animals in their cages and saying good night to them, while unbeknownst to his apparently deaf and blind or at least unbelievably distracted self, the gorilla has stolen his keys and is quietly unlocking all the other animals' cages: the elephant, the lion, the giraffe, the armadillo, whatever.  Then, because animals all apparently live in bad existential faith and don't know what to do with their own freedom once they have it, they docilely and quietly follow the zookeeper into his house to fall asleep in the zookeeper's tiny bedroom.<br /><br />There, the zookeeper and his wife--who is apparently also deaf and blind and in fact not even able to feel the vibrations of a full-grown elephant stomping in through their narrow door and into their bedroom--turn out the lights and say good night to one another.<br /><br />Then, all the animals say \\"Good Night!\\" as well, one at a time, showing a really freaky dark side to the whole story.  THEY'RE KEPT LOCKED IN CAGES, BUT THEY CAN TALK!  They're as sentient and intellectual as humans--in fact far more so than the staggeringly ignorant humans in this story--and they're being kept in cages!  This is...slavery!<br /><br />This is not charming--this is demented.<br /><br />Anyway, this alerts the zookeeper's wife who leads all the talking animals back to their cages as if this happens all the time, but the gorilla grabs the keys again and sneaks back into the house where they climb into bed between the zookeeper and his wife and fall asleep.  Because that's all animals want, to be with people.  Oh, if only all wild animals could be kept in cages and/or beds, how happy they would be!  What the zookeeper and his wife will say when they find the giant sleeping gorilla between them in the morning, I don't know.  Probably something along the lines of, \\"Oh, our lives are so terrible and we are so stupid, someone should write a book about us and illustrate it with mundane, unexciting, uninspired drawings.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion: do not order this book for your kids unless you have a nanny robot that is raising them for you, because if you're the one who reads to them, this book will do nothing but make you hate life and the act of reading aloud to your children.  Your children will continually ask you to read this book to them because something in it may appeal to their young minds that don't know any better, you will read it, they will sense your reluctance, they will perceive that you think readingis unexciting, they will no doubt inherit that belief, will grow up illiterate (or just as bad, aliterate), will not be able to hold a good job as a result, will find themselves homeless during a low point in the economy, and will probably die of exposure beneath a bridge somewhere.  That's how bad this book is.<br /><br />And really, there are so many actually GOOD kids books out there, just don't take that chance.  This book is a horrific chore, and if you can avoid it, do.  There is no joy to be found here, no joy at all.te (or just as bad, aliterate), will not be able to hold a good job as a result, will find themselves homeless during a low point in the economy, and will probably die of exposure beneath a bridge somewhere.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|From the very first episode to its last, Firefly kept me glued to the screen. And I mean glued to the screen from episode 1 to episode 12 in one sitting. The story begins with a scene from the war that leaves enough things unsaid without that useless hanging dissatisfaction, and each episode provided additional layers to characters that continued to develop until the very last episode. Special effects combined with outer-border scenes, and actors working so well together made for a very quirky, funny and hold-your-seats sci-fi western. I am very sad that the series got discontinued.
B00013RC8O|4.0|I finally got around to catching Vanishing Point, the 1971 road film that, like Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, is one long car chase.  This flick above all else, is the film most mentioned in Death Proof, both by the characters and with the use of the white 1970 Dodge Challenger that the girls are test driving at the end of the flick.  Like all the other car flicks I've seen lately, I tried to go into this with unspoiled and with an open mind.<br /><br />Like Two-Lane Blacktop, this flick begins with a slow burn that builds up to become much more than the sum of its parts.  The inter-cutting of scenes with the main character Kowalski (played by Barry Newman) with those of DJ Super Soul (played by Cleavon Little) are first unexplained and odd, but soon become weirdly telepathic, where one character becomes the body and the other the voice of a being that is past it's time on this earth.  The films existential leaning, though, isn't as up front as Two-Lane Blacktop, as the director (Richard C. Sarafian) and the writers (Malcolm Hart & G. Cabrera Infante) very creatively insert some telling flashback sequences that throughout the film bring the audience up to speed with Kowalski and suggest some reasoning behind his long last stand on the road.<br /><br />Though the film is structured a little more commercially viable than Two-Lane, it's not quite as much so as Dirty Mary Crazy Larry and not nearly as mundane as most of Gone in 60 seconds, so it's kind of cool to see a progression of existentialist road movies throughout the 70's.  It's kind of interesting to note that in TLB speed alienates, in DMCL and VP speed kills, and in GI60S speed titillates because by that point people were becoming so enamored by the action that they were probably looking past the meaning.  This is an downward spiral that action movies take throughout the 80s (with films like the Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, and even to a point Top Gun) and which ends ultimately with films like Days of Thunder or Speed and its utterly pointless sequel, Speed 2: Speedier on a Boat No Less (or what ever the hell it was called.)  Car movies are all flash and hardly any substance anymore.  Stuff like the Fast and the Furious or the Transporter (though both fun and exciting) are simply eye candy.

B001V9LRV0|5.0|The movie has been beautifully restored.  Warner Bros did what they could with the directors cut, but most of the technology they used on this release didn't exist then.  Even on the most basic home system you'll be getting a version that looks better and sounds better than any previous release.  And if you have a home system with 5.1 sound, you're in for a real treat.    For me, the best part is all the additional concert footage.  I've seen the original film a number of times, but I wish I could convey how cool it is to watch new footage from a number of the acts performing at the festival - especially the ones that never appeared in any other version of the film (CCR, Mountain, etc).  It makes me wonder just how much more concert footage there actually is.  If there are any complete performances, I would love to see them.  In fact, you can put me down for Mountain, CCR and Johnny Winter right now.    Several of the reviewers have been making a stink over the overdubs.  Let me say that this is still very much a live album.  The so called fixes aren't performance related, they're purely technical.  All the mistakes have been left in and there are no triple tracked guitar solos or anything like that.  The video clip on this site is Santana's \\"Evil Ways\\" performance.  In this instance, there are two percussion players performing, but no percussion on the soundtrack.  It might have been a problem with the equipment the day it was recorded, but since this footage has been sitting in a vault for forty years, it's more likely that the original elements were either lost or corrupted to the point where they were unusable.  So, what do you do?  Do you release concert footage of Santana without a percussion section?  In this case, the restoration crew decided to restore the tracks as close as they could to what the audience heard that day.    This is a wonderful worthwhile release from start to finish, but it's all the new concert footage that really puts it over the top.
B00005N6KG|1.0|While the design looks just like my older model the audio range is not the same. These are very muddy & tinny with a narrow range in sound. I should have double check the model # before ordering these. These will be my emergency backup headphones I guess, but I doubt I'll use them.
B001UREJWM|5.0|I don't really know how to put into words just how incredible this album is. If you like Metal music, then this is for you. Tony Iommi, my personal God, and Geezer Butler join forces with Ronnie James Dio & Vinny Appice once again (the classic Mob Rules/Dehumanizer Black Sabbath lineup) to push the envelope just a bit further. In my opinion, each album from this artist lineup just seems to get better. These guys (sorry, GODS) just have a magic of composition & writing that comes through pure & unrestrained in their music. Literally the ONE thing I have a problem with on this disc is that it's like every other CD on the market these days, over-compressed and overdriven. Ripping the tracks to 192k MP3s fixes this though. Just an amazing album, and as usual with Iommi's work I can't pick a favorite song.
1932100660|5.0|I'm a CRNA (certified registered nurse anesthetist) like most people i was sure that genetic played a large role in my health, which in my case was a poor prognosis. My father died at the age of 29 from heart disease, I was 6 y.o. I had a first cousin die at the age of 21 so i definately had concerns about my longevity and quality of life. I have always moderated, fairly good diet considering what most Americans eat decent exercise schedule. With all that on April 9th 2009 I had a quadruple coronary bypass. My wife who is also a CRNA wanted to keep me around for a while. She started searching the literature for cures for coronary artery disease. The first book she purchased was \\"Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease\\" by Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr., M.D. The second was \\"The China Study\\". If you are serious about taking control of your life and making dietary changes that seem radical. I would highly recommend you purchase these books. All the information you need to make an informed decisions about you and your families well being will be there. The science is not what your doctor or nutritionist is going to tell you about. This is about nutritional science that is well founded but the \\"Powers that  BE\\" don't what you to know. The Dairy Industry, the American Meat Institute, Pharmaceutical Companies and yes your Government have all this information. Because of politics and money you are being lead down the wrong path of health and well being. These books will let you make a conscious decision about your own health. It's not the doctors choice, his amount of nutritional education is nile, and sponsored by the same people that want to keep you in the dark. I'm so glad i have a wife who loves me and wants me around for a while. After one month of dietary changes to a plant based eating plan my cholestrol dropped by 80 to 159, my HDL was 42 the highest its ever been and my LDL was 75 the lowest its been in years even on medication. This is not a fluke its the real deal you just have to read a see for yourself.  Paul L. Duso
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I've been a fan of Van Morrison for years!  His eclectic style is what I like best and this is it!  Secondly, I like that it's a mood-changer.  Well-made music trandcends time and should reach your soul taking you to a natural high.  This is well arranged track by track, disc by disc, giving a good mix to his artistic abilities.
B00004U28G|4.0|The Cannonball Run was one of those flicks I saw constantly on TV growing up in the 80's.  I think it was a law that all UHF or like Fox had to play it on the weekends at least once a month or something; this and flicks like Red Dawn or the Outsiders.<br /><br />For me, this is the prime example of the type of flick that I'd buy in a heartbeat when I see it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, something that I know I'll watch at least once a year and just has a bunch of fun nostalgia memories to it.  Though while I just showed it to a friend recently and was sort of disappointed by it (we watched this directly after Smokey and the Bandit which is a much tighter film, though it's the same principal creators and actor), I'd have to say this when I was a kid this was my favorite \\"grown up\\" movie.  There's just something magical about the duo of Dom DeLuise and Burt Reynolds, between the appearances of \\"Him\\" and the relentless self-mockery of Reynolds, it's just gold to me.<br /><br />Add to this Adrienne Barbeau's \\"Barbeaus\\" clad in tight purple Lycra, the Black Lamborghini, Jackie Chan, a silly cameo by Peter Fonda, the amazingly drunk and on-his-death-bed Dean Martin, and some really funny lines from the crazy Jack Elam as Dr. Nikolas Van Helsing and this is a comedy sm&ouml;rgåsbord.  Unfortunately it is pretty choppy in terms of editing and flow (the cannonballers don't even start the race until like 50 minutes in) there is a lot to love.<br /><br />If nothing else this flick was a labor of love for the writer, Brock Yates, and the Director Hal Needham (who organized and participated in the actual Cannonball Run race) which weird gives a little bit of credit to an otherwise insanely over the top madcap romp.  In fact a lot of the background actors and most of the vehicles used were from the real race including the ambulance and the Ferrari.  It's also one of five or so pairings Needham had with Reynolds in the 70's and 80's including Smokey and the Bandit I+II, Hooper, Stroker Ace, and the Cannonball Run sequel.ll Run sequel.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|Short:  Get it on Blu-ray, well worth it and priced right.    Story (4/5):  I always supported Pixar and their movies because they were all about the story telling and creating an epic environment.  They usually avoided all the off-topic jokes and pop culture references that you'll typically see in most animated family movies.  Cars crossed that line a bit, but the story telling is still there.  It seems unique and typical at the same time, which makes no sense, but that is how it feels.  I can't say more than that without spoiling the movie.    Visuals (5/5):  While watching the film, I kept saying in my head, \\"Man, that must've been expensive to make.\\"  It looks amazing and detailed, and they didn't blur out distance details to say time and money.  Moreover, without the human features, the cars would be hard to distinguish from the real thing.  So this is a must buy for Blu-ray people.  One should also consider upgrading their entertainment center for Pixar movies in general, or you'll be missing out.    Characters and Voicing (5/5):  Another great thing about Pixar films is that they cast people that fit the roles they're voicing.  No random popular celebrity for marketing purposes.  Owen Wilson, Bonnie Hunt, and Larry the Cable Guy (to name a few) all did great jobs voicing his/her character.  The characters (with car type matching their personality) are very interesting across the board.
B000TGQDZQ|4.0|This album has alot to offer. Sometimes it seems like they are trying to outdo themselves. If they toned it down a little bit it would be alot better. But its still a really good album. Some of the songs are too long for their own good, and some of the changes in the songs are very abrubt. There is only one guitar solo on the ablum (beyond belief) and the death metal vocals sometimes seemed too forced ( i like death vocals done like how Opeth does them, not so much like epica does them.) But overall the songs usually flow very well. Simmone is amazing on the vocals. The guitar is very good as well, but sometimes it gets a little repetative with all the palm muted riffs. and it could have used a few more solos to liven things up a bit. But thats just my opinon, most of the spots where they could potentially go are filled by beautifully done orchastration. There is alot of great orchastration and choir on this album. The bass does its job, i enjoy it but its nothing to get really excited about. The drummer is very skilled and definitly proves that on \\"The Divine Conspricy\\" but sometimes its a little much. I bought this album because I am a Nightwish fan and was looking similar bands. If you like Nightwish you should enjoy this album for the most part. If you want to listen to a song or too before buying the album, I would suggest Living A Lie, Never Enough, Safeguard to Paradise, or The Divine Conspiricy (if you have the time, and i think this is an amazinging song and i'm not sure what other people are talking about when they say its bad). If you're already into this kind of music, i would definitly say go ahead and get this right now despite its flaws its still a very very impressive album. If you have never listened to a band like Epica you definitly need to listen to a few songs on the internet or something for a while and see if its for you, as others stated, this music is an aquired taste.
B001POX73C|2.0|KINDLE REVIEW<br /><br />I first read these books from my mother's library (and many of them were from my grandmother) and always loved them for the lively historical romps they are. I looked forward to reading these on my Kindle, but the 4 books I purchased all have serious errors, rendering them almost unreadable.<br /><br />Dialog runs together without spacing, making it almost impossible to tell who is speaking, paragraphs run together (and given Heyer's frequent use of paragraphs which are more than a page long anyway, that's painful) and in sections the page formatting (no matter what the type size) consists of a full line of text followed by a single hanging word.<br /><br />I probably won't return the books because of my love of the contents, but I'm very disappointed in Amazon and the publisher, and will check samples of future releases before I pay for them.
B000009HF2|5.0|I bought this to re-live my youth and it delivers.  Frampton is a classic for those who were teens in the 70's and a must for their collections.  Great road trip music!
B000B5XOSO|4.0|Batman Returns is such a weird movie.  It sort of holds the opposite distinction than the first Batman for me because whereas I was the perfect age for the first film, when this came out in theaters I was 15, sort of jaded and ended up pretty disappointed in the movie.  In fact this is one of the first flicks that I should have loved but didn't which has only gotten worse and worse as I've gotten older.<br /><br />Over the years Batman Returns has grown on my quite a bit.  I love the lengths that Tim Burton went to in order to keep some semblance of creative freedom, even going so far as making Batman a minor character in a film full of villains just to keep his interest up.  At the time I hated it, but now I just think it was an amazingly brave move.  Hell, done right the villains usually provide the more interesting fodder for stories any way, so it stands to reason that they could conceivably carry a movie.  I've always thought that Danny Devito was the only choice to play the Penguin, in particular in the somewhat gory, dark, twisted Burton style.  High Society, Top Hat-Wearing, crime lords just seem goofy, but put 'em in dirty pajamas, with actual penguin-like deformities, surround them with sideshow flunkies, and I'm on board.<br /><br />If the first film felt like Tim Burton invading Batman's world, than this film feels more like Batman, Catwoman, and the Penguin invading Burton's.  It's unfortunate though that the series didn't end here because this film introduced a lot of aspects that, though they worked here, would go on to help ruin the further sequels.  Having the Batmobile be able to jettison two thirds of it's mass to fit down a narrow alley was kind of silly and it lead to doing all kinds of weird crap with the car later on, not limited to driving up the side of a building.  It was in this film where the villain to super hero ratio was upped as well.  For all intents and purposes there were three villains in the film (between Devito, Pheiffer, and Walken), which would be surpassed in Batman forever by mixing Two-Face, his gang, his girls, the Riddler, and a weird gang of neon, glow-in-the-dark paint wearing freaks, and then again in Batman and Robin (Bane, Poison Ivy, that weird doctor guy, Mr. Freeze and his crazy henchmen) though at least by then there was a Robin and Batgirl to help make it a silly character filled madcap romp that, 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.ld be surpassed in Batman forever by mixing Two-Face, his gang, his girls, the Riddler, and a weird gang of neon, glow-in-the-dark paint wearing freaks, and then again in Batman and Robin (Bane, Poison Ivy, that weird doctor guy, Mr. Freeze and his crazy henchmen) though at least by then there was a Robin and Batgirl to help make it a silly character filled madcap romp that, 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back.

This is a very quick read and the information is basic but powerful. If you read this book and did what it said your marriage would improve greatly. You probably need your spouse to be on board, well worth the price!! I plan on applying it to my Queen, who deserves nothing less.
B000089RVX|4.0|I bought this album because I like Nightwish. It was cheap on the walmart shelf so i picked it up. I actually like this alot more than I ever expected. It's true, the songs are somewhat repetative, and the nu metal-mess of the riffs is quite obvious. But other than those few things i really enjoy this album. It has a lot of great individual songs on it. The one star reviews are being a bit harsh on the downsides of the album. Amy Lee has a very beautiful voice and the piano and strings on the album are very good. Its obvious that the music is directed toward being commercially successful, but hell.. why not?  If you like female fronted bands I think you really need to have this album, even thow it leans more towards the popish sound. If not, then mabey should should look elsewhere, because i cant see anyone listening this for just the guitar or something.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Johnny Depp is perfect as the \\"eccentric\\" candy man.  Deep Roy and the rest of the cast are terrific too!  And the music and CGI are perfect.  What a fun, relaxing experience.  Willy Wonka was always a childhood favorite, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory totally outdoes \\"WW\\".  You'll be in for a treat!
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie is excellent. It is heartbreaking to see a people enduring genocide. As I was watching it, I suddenly felt no pity for the jews being slaughtered. They gave up their guns in 1938, and they did not try to fight back against the nazis. They laid down several times in the movie like sheep to the slaughter. I began to lose all respect for them, because they did not care enough to fight for their freedom, or even their lives. I was heartened by the Warsaw Ghetto uprising scenes. People willing to die as free men, and not as slaves.    Remember, every country which has complete gun control ends up like this. History is replete with examples of people who give up their guns and are slaughtered by the majority. Also, most people don't even know what the word \\"Nazi\\" stands for. The word \\"Nazi\\" is an abbreviated translation of \\"National Socialist German Worker's Party\\". Don't forget that Socialists are murderers and will kill you.
B001ECDVKE|3.0|Mars Attacks! is one of only two movies that I can think of which are based on trading card sets (the other being Garbage Pail Kids the Movie.)  I first saw Mars Attacks in the theater with my friend Jeremy a little bit after we graduated from high school, which was a heavy theater-going time for me. I think I was averaging about 1 flick every two weeks or so during that time because I finally had a car and could go by myself, not to mention that I worked the night shift and there wasn't much else to do during the day when I couldn't sleep.<br /><br />By this time I was a pretty big fan of Burton's, having basically come of age watching Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman and Batman Returns, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands.  I also loved Ed Wood, which I saw after picking up Plan 9 From Outer Space on clearance at my local Media Play based on the tag line that it was the worst movie ever and loving it.  When Mars Attacks came out I thought Burton could do no wrong and I fully expected to fall in love with the flick.  Sadly I didn't.  Actually I hated it the first time I saw it.  I've never been a big fan of CGI and the flick is loaded to the gills with it, which surprised me since one of the reasons I dug Burton so much was his amazing work with practical effects and set design. It didn't help that I wasn't all that familiar with the card set and I was kind of getting sick of the trend where actors would play multiple parts in films (ala Eddie Murphy.)<br /><br />There was one scene in the flick that I loved though, enough so that years later when I was browsing through the $5 DVD section in Target I couldn't help but pick the flick up.  The scene in question involves Sarah Jessica Parker and Pierce Brosnan.  They both have their heads removed and there's this crazy moment when their severed heads are rolling around and then they come together with a kiss.  While I was re-watching it recently it occurred to me that this is the key to this film.  Sure it's got a silly plot and it's mostly about inane visuals, which typically makes me tune out while watching a film, but in this films case it's truly it's strength.  See the flick is based on a trading card set, and at the end of the day that's all this film really is, a collection of crazy scenes that are very loosely connected into a story.  Any one of these scenes would make an awesome trading card, and the inane plot which drives it would perfectly fit in a small caption, either on the front or as a summary on the back.  The fact that Burton and Jonathon Gems (the screenwriter) would try and focus on this aspect of the source material astounds me.  In fact it sounds more like a film school experiment than a big budget Hollywood film, which I think took a lot of guts and is also probably to blame for it's lack of acceptance.<br /><br />This is what I would consider to be one of the perfect discount DVDs, one that I would have a hard time paying much more than the cost of a good lunch for.  I do have to admit though that I probably wouldn't have as much admiration for it if another director had done it, but then again, I can't imagine too many other people out there who would have (well maybe the Chiodo brothers who brought us the classic Killer Klowns From Outer Space.)mostly about inane visuals, which typically makes me tune out while watching a film, but in this films case it's truly it's strength.

B001W63DXC|4.0|Let's face it - every live Maiden album has had to live in the shadow of \\"Live After Death.\\" LAD did what a live metal album should do - speed songs up that needed to be faster, crank the guitar overdrive so that they sound heavier, slow songs down that should have been slower, and have plenty of improvisation not found in the studio recording (I'm looking at you, Nicko!). LAD did just that, and in my opinion (huge Maiden fan, BTW), all other live Maiden albums that followed LAD choked. Hard.<br /><br />Flight 666 delivers in ways that surprised me. When I first heard IM would be releasing a new concert CD, I thought \\"Here we go again, do I really need another version of 'Number of the Beast' or 'Hallowed Be Thy Name'?\\" But the set list here is different because the subject of the \\"Somewhere Back in Time Tour\\" was different. They were not promoting an album per se, but were attempting to deliver to us older fans a glimpse of what we could remember from 1985 (when I was just a wee teenager), and give the younger fans a taste of what it was like 25 years ago.  But the setlist here does not disappoint. Many of the tracks are rarities (\\"Moonchild,\\" for example), but all of them come from the golden age - Number of the Beast through Seventh Son (and they threw in \\"Fear of the Dark\\" as well, which is a big crowd pleaser in South America). At the end of the day, the set list is excellent.<br /><br />The production quality is good, and I knocked a star off because it isn't excellent production quality. Sometimes the reverb gets a little overwhelming, especially from the larger venues. Also, the mixing of three guitars is still not right. On LAD, Murray's guitar occupied the left channel exclusively, and Smith's the right channel (Harris, Nicko, & Bruce were center channel, or both L+R in your headphones/stereo speakers). But with three guitarists, the mixing is all over the place. I noticed Smith's guitar sliding in and out of center channel like it did on Rock in Rio, andfor the most part Murray is still on the left channel and Gers on the right during rhythm sections, but when one of them steps up to perform a solo, the signal gets weird and starts sliding around. I was hoping that the sound engineers would put Murray on the left exclusively, Gers on center channel (both L+R) exclusively, and Smith on the right exclusively. So just be aware that if you're wondering who is playing which solo, you might not get it right based on where their guitar signal \\"came from\\" just prior to playing the solo. Most fans probably won't care about this, but as an avid guitarist myself, I like to rack and stack the members of Maiden to see who has improved the most through the years (Smith, your solos still make me smile, man!).<br /><br />Lastly, the CD is more pleasurable to me than the DVD because then we don't have to watch Gers make a fool of himself on stage by tring to act like Ritchie Blackmore and Pete Townshend.
B001P5HI4A|4.0|I've just finished reading Streisands biography. The author made mention that the love scene between  Yentl and his wife was highly sexual. [I can't remember her exact words!]I didn't find that particular scene to be so. I did enjoy the theme song. The film was entertaining.
0756405890|5.0|I am not normally a Sci-Fi/Fantasy reader, but this book caught my attention and held it until the end!   To write a book this captivating is in itself an enormous undertaking, but to also create a new universe for his characters is something I know alot of authors could never accomplish.  It baffles me to see poor reviews of this book on this website. Did these people read the same book?  I commend Mr. Rothfuss on his excellent story telling and thank him for writing a book I consider to be one of my new favorites! I cannot wait for the second installment!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|Beetlejuice is one of those flicks that I think I've seen at least 50 times over the years and I never get tired of it.  This is one of those film projects where practically every aspect of film making just came together to produce something that for my money is just about as close to perfect as you can get.  It's funny and light while also being fairly dark and morbid.  It has a wonderful mix of special effects, from practical and optical to animation (mostly stop motion), most of which haven't dated at all, and still look better than 98% of the CGI out there.  It's perfectly cast, featuring some of my favorite performances from actors like Alec Baldwin, Gena Davis, and Catherine O'Hara, not to mention Michael Keaton's turn as the titular character (who has enough amazing scenes that he steals the film while only being in it about 20% of it.)  Most of all it's one of Tim Burton's most solid efforts that captures both his vision and style without seeming like a \\"Burton\\" film (like say how the Corpse Bride, Sleepy Hollow, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory all seem to be a Burton film first and foremost.)  Everything in the film feels like it's part of the Beetlejuice universe more than the Burton universe.<br /><br />Though there isn't much in terms of special features on this disc, it does contain a couple episodes of the Beetlejuice cartoon for the first time on DVD.
0743454537|1.0|This book completely ruined any will I had to read a book by Jodi Picoult.  I'm a high school student and a whole bunch of my friends were raving about how good this book was.  Then I saw the trailer for the movie and decided I had to read the book before the movie came out, because the books are always better then the movie.  Well if this book is better then the movie, there's no hope at all for the movie.    ---Spoilers(kind of)  Honestly, I was really into this book at the beginning, I couldn't put it down.  Within two days I was at the end and was so excited when Kate and Anna won their court case.  Finally, Anna would have control over her own body.    And then Picoult takes the cheap way out of the book.  Leaves us with no ending, so we don't know if Anna would have given Kate her kidney or not.  Instead she kills Anna in a cheap car crash.  I honestly wish I stopped the book once the verdict of the case was reached.    Now my friends are all raving about how excellent 19 minutes was.  Too bad I refuse to read another book from this horrible author.
0756405890|5.0|For many years I believed that the days of the epic were long over. The Iliad and the Odyssey, the legend of King Arthur Pendragon... never again would I find a tale which could beautifully catalog the journey of a human hero. Some might describe such a long tale as going on 'ad nauseum,' but if that is the case, it is the bile of gods and reeks of ambrosia. I came close once when I discovered The Chronicles of Amber by Roger Zelazny. A very good story, with the length of an epic. It came close, but watching the development of a family or of a world is not the same as being present for the growth of a single character.    The Name of the Wind is the beginning of a metafictional epic, and if I could believe this was the beginning of the literary moment, I could die depressed today for knowing that there were more like it coming that I would be missing. Rothfuss stays true to his character from page to page, from chapter to chapter, never allowing any question of the tale's veracity. The book itself is a bargain, for you will read it numerous times over the years.    Then again, considering that, you might want the hardback.

B001HPP2X2|5.0|i absolutely *love* this show. i cant believe ive never watched it b4 now. i got hooked within the 1st ep. i also got my friends into it as well. i spent 2 days watching all of season 1. i couldnt stop watching it. i am glad i bought this instead of true blood which i.m.o isnt as great n capturing as dexter. it is a must watch!! i cant wait to receive season 2. and i am a bit bummed that season 3 isnt coming out till aug. also i suggest watching it in blu-ray its much much more clearer n absolutely awesome.

The colors pop, you see detail you never saw in the original DVD.<br /><br />And yes, some of the songs have been \\"repaired\\" with added instrumentation, which I have NO PROBLEM WITH.  I suppose it would be immoral if they didn't tell us they did it.  But they told us.  They even made a video to show the process, which is pretty amazing.<br /><br />So quit complaining and turn it up!<br /><br />And oh yeah, groovy.<br /><br />Kaz

0199535981|5.0|That famous quote from Shakespeare's Hamlet certainly applies to Dorian Gray.  And Lord Henry Wotton couldn't help using this quote, much like he couldn't help baiting Dorian Gray.  Lord Henry admires the man in Basil Hallward's new portrait so much that he has got to meet him.  Is he as beautiful in real life as he is in the painting?  Is he ever!  He is an Adonis, a young man as pure on the inside as he is on the outside.  No wonder Hallward is obsessed with him!  So begins Lord Henry's attempts to corrupt the young man.  In no uncertain terms, he tells Dorian Gray that \\"beauty is the wonder of wonders.  It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.\\"  He also goes on to tell him that his wonderful youth and good looks are his best qualities, too bad someday they will fade.  Dorian Gray is upset.  His portrait will remain young and beautiful forever, whereas he will age and lose with his physical beauty.  If only it were the other way around...<br /><br />That is all I'll share in terms of plot.  You have got to read this magnificent novel to know the rest.  The Picture of Dorian Gray, first published in 1890, is one of the most disturbing works of fiction I have ever read.  No wonder it is so popular!  It is thought provoking from beginning to end.  Dorian is a cross between Narcissus and Faust -- his vanity is obvious from the very start, and Lord Henry is depicted as a devil, whereas Hallward is the angel who tries to maintain Dorian's innocence.  Yes, as it has often been observed, the novel does have some not-so-concealed references to homosexuality.  The aforementioned theme, mainly noticeable in Hallward, is, in the words of Marianne Dashwood in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility, \\"implied but never declared.\\"  There was no need for Wilde to say it in so many words, but he dropped hints here and there, like the rumors that Hallward moved to San Francisco.  I doubt he would have been able to be more inconspicuous in his time.  This novel could cover long hours of discussion.  There are so many themes and symbolism and magic realism and foreshadowing here, and Lord Henry's crude but honest musings and observations are fascinating.  He is definitely the most interesting character in the book.  This is my first time reading this book.  I'd wanted to read it since I read Amanda Filipacchi's Nude Men ten years ago.  Why it took me so long to give it a whirl I will never know.  Better late than never, I guess.  And if you haven't read it, well, need I suggest that you do?  You won't regret it.  This is nineteenth century literature at its finest.over long hours of discussion.

B00009AOBI|5.0|This is the true movie Cher should have won the Oscar for.  I will never forget her remarkable performance.
B001PJRAUS|4.0|While I love this series, I am disappointed that there are scenes missing. I got hooked on the series through scenes posted on YouTube and several of them are not on the DVD. I would have to think that this was done to fit the entire series on one disk, but the makers should realize that if I am willing to commit 3 hours, I would  give up 3.5 to see all of it. Same with the cost, I would have paid a few extra dollars to have a second disk if needed.    Still I recommend it. Very cute rendition. My 9 year old sat through all 3 hours last night and at the end stated that she hoped they would make another!
B001R60ESE|5.0|I just saw Chris at the Fillmore (formerly Jackie Gleason) on Miami Beach in the end of April. It was an amazing concert and we were fortunate to be there when Tito Puent&eacute; was in the audience. Tito was invited on stage and played a several minute jam with the drummer. The whole night was really cool, the sound was excellent and the show was great from start to the finish when Chris played an unamplified solo of \\"One More for the Road\\" in the audience.<br /><br />This Blu-ray concert is right there. I was taken back to the night at the Fillmore, but this time with much better seats, more guest performers and all in the beautiful Boston Symphony Hall. The sound is spectacular and the Blu-ray footage is like being there.<br /><br />Get this disc, you will love it!
B001AVEJ1Y|5.0|I have been a fan of the series and all of the movies and continue to be after seeing this film with my son and his friends.  While they were not nearly as interested in the unfolding of the story, I was intrigued.  I was particularly moved with the Spock storyline.  It made sense and also coordinates with several original episodes when Spock is 'seemingly' out of character.  I cannot wait to see this film again and hope I am one of the first to get the DVD.  For the die-hard fans .... fear not in appealing to a younger generation.  As soon as we left the theater, the boys wanted to get the original series from Netfliks.  As the sequels come along, I think we'll see a better bridge between the \\"old and the new\\".
B00005OCMR|4.0|When this came out, about 25 years ago, the special-effects were eye-popping. I was stunned and saw this twice at the theater, something I rarely did. Nowadays, it looks primitive. It's like when video games first came out, compared to what they are now.    However, a few years ago when this \\"anniversary\\" DVD came out with the widescreen and 5.1 surround sound, it made it \\"respectable\\" again in parts and made it still fun to watch. There is a ton of supplmental material, too, that you might like.    The story was never that great. There was too much technical talk and the characters were the kind you really couldn't get involved over. Yet,. it's a film you could easily watch over and over again and always be fascinated.   I don't recall any other movie quite like it
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|This is a great story that weaves itself around the Legendary Robert Johnson, a deal with the devil and a lost song. Ralph 'Karate Kid' Macchio delivers a great performance as Eugene, a classical guitarist that is haunted by the blues. He enlists the help of Willie Brown (Joe Seneca)an aged crotchety old man who knew Robert Johnson and cons Eugene to break him out of a home and take him on a road trip down to the home of the blues, Mississippi. Needless to say they get into a heap of trouble, and with the slide guitar supplied by Ry Cooder this film keeps you entertained all the way. The climax is the guitar duel between Eugene and Scratch (Steve Vai) for Willie's and Eugene's souls.  I had been looking for this film for a long time, and it was great to get it and see it again. For the price, fantastic!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is one of the best movie soundtracks ever! I love all of the songs on it although my favourite is \\"Mutemath - Spotlight (Twilight Mix)\\" followed closely by \\"Muse - Supermassive Black Hole\\". I do wish Robert Pattinson's song \\"Let Me Sign\\" would have been on the soundtrack as well.    Every time you listen to the songs it takes you back to the specific scene in the movie that the song played. By buying this album I was introduced to loads of new music that normally I wouldn't have listened to.     I am very happy with this soundtrack and hope the New Moon Soundtrack is equally as good.

B00026ZG10|4.0|Boy, I haven't seen this in quite a while but I did watch it several times in the mid '90s and usually was thoroughly entertained. It's pretty long at 141 minutes but I don't remember anyone ever complaining they were bored watching this. The combination of spectacular action scenes and humor made this a big hit.    I'm surprised this has not come out on Blu-Ray yet (as of June, 2009).    Tom Arnold has the best part in here with light-hearted humor, albeit on the sleazy side (no surprise, there!).  Speaking of \\"Arnold,\\" there's Schwarnegger giving us one of his better performances, and Jamie Lee Curtis doing what she does best: showing us her incredible body.     This film has the standard too-long action ending and has some parts that are so outrageous that you almost have to laugh out loud. Then again, a lot of this story is tongue-in-cheek so a lot of the absurdity here fits.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I'm a long-time fan of Depeche Mode (bought my first 12\\" back in '86!), and while this isn't a bad album, it's certainly not one that a random person would want to pick up and judge the band by.<br /><br />DM (as we fans call them) have created some truly masterpiece albums over their 30-ish year career, and if you're just someone who's looking to see what Depeche Mode has to offer, I suggest you start with some of their other albums: Violator, Music For The Masses, Black Celebration, Songs Of Faith And Devotion, and/or Ultra all come to mind as great ways to hear some great songs by Depeche Mode.<br /><br />\\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" is a departure from their normal, radio single-focused songwriting style. It's ok, it's not great, but unless you're a true fan, I'd say that this is one of the last albums you should worry about buying.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|A superlative achievement, Clint Eastwood's \\"Gran Torino\\" (2008) charts new territory for the legendary actor-director while continuing his cinematic winning streak. The fact that Eastwood made this film and the powerful \\"Changeling\\" in the same year is nothing short of astonishing. Just when you thought Clint had retired from acting, he emerges with another classic portrayal as a redemptive veteran in a changing urban landscape. Hollywood rarely gets it right these days, but Eastwood delivers the goods. \\"Gran Torino\\" represents the movie icon at his absolute best.
0783110871|3.0|Here's one of those films that wears you out. By the end, you're exhausted. I really liked this the first two times but three viewings were enough. By then, the absurdity of the whole thing had fried what few brain cells I have left. Still, I got my money's worth with this DVD.    Ray Liotta is excellent as the psycho serial killer who puts on a charming Ted Bundy-like appearance for a short while before publicly showing his insanity. He's fascinating, start to finish here, even providing some very humorous lines.    I wish I could say I enjoyed the other people in here but, except for Ben Cross, I couldn't. Lauren Holly, the female star of the film, is decent for much of the \\"ride\\" but becomes annoying and totally non-believable in the final phase of the film, becoming out-of-character profane and nasty herself. (Of course, her flight did turn out to be a tiny bit stressful which might have affected her patience.....ya think?!    Of course, with a film like this, there are going to be some severe questions with credibility, but when did that ever stop filmmakers?  This is just escapist entertainment for a night, something to show your girlfriend so she'll hold onto you during all the suspense!    Anyway, I enjoyed the special effects, especially with the plane smashing a few buildings, and the sound was awesome, at least on the DVD. For much of the flight, they are flying through a storm and the rumbles form the shaking airliner, was dramatic.
0316017922|5.0|An outlier is literally a point (e.g., a test score) that lies outside of the pack formed by the other points: the one point in a chart that doesn't seem to belong. Gladwell's basic claim is that successful people are outliers: something in their past allowed them and helped them to take an advantage, and carry it to the extreme. The book debunks the myth of instant success, demystifies many self made stories, and stresses instead the importance of hard work. Gladwell puts an entirely new spin to old success stories.<br /><br />Here are Gladwell's ingredients of success: (1) You have to be good at what you do, but by no means do you need to be the most intelligent/talented. (2) You have to be the in the right place at the right time to get that unique opportunity in your youth that others just don't get. (3) You need 10,000 hours of practice. That is, ten years of concentrated work, three hours per day, seven days per week.<br /><br />It's tempting to cite examples from the book, but that would ruin the reading experience, so I will restrain myself. Gladwell has a way of drawing you in, which makes the book so charming. Just go with the flow, and allow yourself to be surprised. It's the effect the book had on me, although I had  read or heard about many of the concepts in the book.<br /><br />This book is an optimistic book. Even though it may be too late for all of us to take that singular opportunity that makes a Bill Gates, we can still find our niche and be truly outstanding at it - provided that we are willing to spend that three hours per day for ten years. And if it's something you really love, it's not work at all. This book has made me think about my past successes and failures, and it has given a new dimension to my job, my hobbies, and my aspirations.<br /><br />This book has been criticized for being poorly researched old hat. Those critics have no idea what this book is trying to do. It has been said that Voltaire never had an original thought in his life. Who cares? Few remember the luminaries who had the original ideas, but many remember Voltaire who rephrased those ideas in such a spirited fashion. As I said, many of the concepts I already knew, but I had never put them together the way Gladwell did. That is where the true value of this book lies.luminaries who had the original ideas, but many remember Voltaire who rephrased those ideas in such a spirited fashion.

B0019O19AG|5.0|The rules for Quoridor are a paragraph long. You can understand everything you need to play the game in just a few minutes of watching someone play. The whole game takes five, maybe ten minutes. And yet it's completely absorbing, deeply challenging, often surprising, uniquely compelling.<br /><br />The game is played on a 9x9 grid. Deep channels separate the squares. These channels are deep enough to hold a \\"wall\\" - a thin wooden rectangle wide enough to span the border of two squares. Each player has a wooden pawn. The object of the game is to be the first player to advance her pawn to the opposite side of the board. Each player, in the two-player version, also gets ten walls. On your turn you can either move your pawn one square horizontally or vertically, or you can add a wall. These two choices seem remarkably familiar, elegantly embodying a fundamental political dynamic: to advance our own cause, or to prevent the opposition from advancing. The result of this debate is the creation of an evermore complex maze, again depicting something remarkably familiar to anyone engaged in political discourse. Republicans, democrats, lovers, parents, children.<br /><br />As Rob Solow reports, Quoridor is such an elegant game that it can be easily played (with some minor modifications) with a 5-year-old. And that is another important thing to note about Quoridor - because it is so easy to understand, because it's components are so few and so functional, it is also easy to modify. Like tic tac toe, Quoridor invites you to come up with new ways to play. Rob talks about giving the weaker player more walls. Since you can play several games in a half-hour, it is easy to create a handicapping system where the losing player gets two more fences for the next round.<br /><br />Quoridor comes with four different-color pawns. In the four-player version, each player gets five wall pieces, and the pawns start out in the center of the board rather than on the opposite ends. This points to yet another variable - the starting position of the pawns. Then there's the rule for what happens when two pawns meet. In the standard rules, they get to jump over each other. But that, clearly, is only the beginning. And one can't help but gleefully contemplate the implications of a two-player version with four pawns.<br /><br />Quoridor exemplifies the kind of thinking game that prompted the creation of the Major FUN award. It can be intensely competitive, but its elegance and brevity make playing the game itself fun, no matter who wins.<br /><br />Designed by Mirko Marchesi, Quoridor is another beautifully rendered wooden game from Gigamic, available in the US through the wise auspices of Fundex Games.he starting position of the pawns.

B0017U7PT6|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever made. It is historically innaccurate, terribly written, and poorly realized. It is an insult to any intelligent viewer.  Here you have pyramids, swords, and other items that didn't exist 10,000 BC.  Worse, although the poster for the movie shows a sabre-tooth cat, the feline is only on screen for a few seconds. It would have been a much better film just showing animal life of the period.  The human part is ridiculous. I couldn't wait to get rid of this on Ebay.  To realize what garbage this is you must see Quest for Fire, which is an excellent film, although it takes place 40,000 BC.  Then you will realize what possibilities there are. Emmerich is a hack; what do you expect from the maker of the idiotic Day After Tomorrow?
B0021L9MJG|3.0|I really love this film, but I can't figure out why Warner Home Video is putting this out on Blu-ray and not cleaning up the really hideous standard DVD release they did of this film a few years back. The beauty of \\"Creepshow\\" is in its wit and storytelling, not special effects or big scenes in which high definition would be particularly effective. Those of us who are not willing to make the leap to Blu in this economy would really like to see this film get a standard DVD release that is decent. On top of that this release will have absolutely no extra features on it.<br /><br />That being said, the movie is terrific from not only a classic horror film point of view, but if you are old enough you can appreciate the players in what are really transitional roles for them. Ted Danson plays a man in love with the wife of a vindictive wealthy man. That man is played by Leslie Nielson. Nielson had not yet been typecast as a comedian, although he had done the first \\"Airplane\\" movie by the time this film was made in 1982. Likewise, this was Ted Danson's last role before he became Sam Malone in an eleven year run on \\"Cheers\\". Up to this point he had mainly bit parts in films. Steven King, who like Alfred Hitchcock always did a cameo in his films, here gets to have one of the five stories all to himself in a one man show about a luckless backwoods man who has a meteor land in his front yard.<br /><br />If you like cheesy horror, you'll love this one, but don't expect to understand the logic of this release - I don't.<br />The film - 5/5 stars.<br />Ponderous treatment of the film on DVD and Blu - 1/5 stars.<br />Average = 3/5 stars

I'm 125 pounds and 5'3\\" so I'm average sized. i just wanted to get in shape, not really lose a lot of weight. I was a cheerleader for 3 years, and I stopped this year so I figured I should stay in shape some how. I decided to order these dvds since I love the biggest loser. I ordered the \\"no more troubles\\" \\"30 day shred\\" \\"power sculpt\\" \\"cardio max\\" and the \\"burn fat, boost metabolism\\". I have to say, my favorite was DEFIANTLY this one, the 30 day shred. It was such a good workout for me, I was huffing and puffing, by the half way mark. ON LEVEL ONE! This is an excellent workout, none of the other ones did this to me, I have been sore for 3 days now, and It makes me want to work out even harder because I know that it is working! I would recommend this to everyone wanting to get in shape and even to lose weight, trust me you will surely feel it working. I would say get this one before any other one though. It makes you work the hardest. Jillian is so inspiring too. You don't even realize how long you are doing the exercises because she talks to you and motivates you. THANKS! :)
B000XYNFD2|5.0|I've owned one watch for 24 years, a Rolex GMT Master, and it is my most prized possession. I never even really wanted another watch, except another Rolex, the Submariner. Well, in today's economy, plunking down $4,000 to $5,000 for a watch just seems a little irresponsible. I ran across the 'little brother' of this watch, the Invicta 8926 Pro Diver with Japanese automatic movement, one day on a shopping channel for $89 and thought why not? It sure looks like a Sub. When I got it, I was really blown away by the quality. Then I started researching and discovered there is a Swiss movement version of the Invicta Pro Diver, the 9937. Since I always considered myself a bit of a watch snob, I wanted the best, so even though the 8926 was absolutely great, I ordered the 9937. As previous reviewers have mentioned, it is worth the extra money. The crystal, the cyclops, the nicer band and heavy duty clasp and of course the Swiss movement all added up to a really beautiful piece of fine jewelry. I actually prefer the way it feels on my wrist to my older Rolex, it's just a bit heavier, feels very solid, and the case is a bit thicker. The band actually surpasses the Rolex band, quite surprising. The movement is quite nice and the accuracy is on par with the Rolex. No automatic watch will ever be as accurate as a quartz, but + or - a few seconds a day really isn't that big a deal to me. I'm not crazy about the engraved 'Invicta' on the side of the case (of all Invictas), but frankly, it's hardly noticeable. I found this watch on sale for about $265. It's easily worth much, much more IMHO.  Buy it, you'll like it. An if you're on a budget, grab the 8926, you can find that for under $100 if you look around
0756405890|5.0|I enjoy reading but it's often difficult for me to find a book that really captivates my attention. I'm not easily entertained and unless my mind can take the imagery from the book and run with it, I'm not interested.<br /><br />I received this book from a friend of mine who had read it and sang it's praises. Skeptical, I took it from him and brought it home. I sat down to read it, expecting to be bored as I am with most books, when something happened: I was drawn in, completely, within the first few pages.<br /><br />I've read the negative reviews on Mr. Rothfuss's book and, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, I really must protest. For a girl who's life is constantly moving and changing, it's hard for me to find time to sit down for more than 10 minutes and actually enjoy something. I -found- time to enjoy this book.<br /><br />\\"The Name of the Wind\\" has a little bit of everything. Magic, romance, music, murder, humor, friendship, family bonds, loss, gain, revenge, poverty and aristocracy. I devoured this book in a weekend and was left hungry for more.<br /><br />Sure, I guess this book may not be for some people (as enforced by the few bad reviews \\"TNOTW\\" has seen), but even if you add the 60 four star reviews, 30 three star reviews, 22 two star reviews and the 19 one star reviews all together, you still can't surpass the 394 (soon to be 395) positive 5 star reviews that \\"The Name of the Wind\\" rightly deserves.<br /><br />Thank you Patrick Rothfuss, for a genuinely enjoyable and wonderful story. I hope others will see this review and take a chance on this book as I once did, so they too may be enveloped in it's wonderful tale.<br /><br />- Megan Kaye
B000VNMMPM|4.0|\\"Angel-A,\\" from visionary French director Luc Besson, is a snazzy, jazzy comic fantasy about a petty hood who's so up to his neck in debt that his only recourse would appear to be jumping off the nearest bridge into the Seine below. Lucky for him, he's rescued at the last moment by a leggy, blond angel who's been sent to earth to help the poor, benighted soul find a new purpose and meaning in life.  However, much to her surprise, Angela (aka Angel-A) discovers that, even for a celestial being like herself, the process of redemption can turn out to be a bit of a two-way street.<br /><br />Filmed in glorious black-and-white, the movie provides us with a playful tour of a picture-perfect Paris, as Andre and Angela go about the business of raising the exorbitant sums of money Andre will need if he is to avoid being rubbed out by all the unsavory characters out to get him.  And, indeed, Andre is pretty much a complete failure as a criminal, being both too open-hearted and too lacking in self-confidence to ever be truly successful in that line of work.  Apparently, it takes an intervention by a divine being like Angela to bring out the best in the man.<br /><br />Rie Rasmussen and Jamel Debbouze are both wonderful in their roles of the savior and the saved, but the real star of this sweet, witty and highly stylized motion picture is the rich and glowing cinematography by Thierry Arbogast, which provides the visual equivalent of stepping into a series of Ansel Adams photos brought miraculously to life.  And, quite frankly, I doubt that Paris itself has ever looked more stunning than it does in this film.
1423113497|5.0|I actually posted this on a discussion thread on books for fifth graders.  But I decided it fit well in a review, so here it is. I feel (as a mom and as a teacher) that this series is great for everyone from strong fourth grade readers through eighth grade and beyond.      My now 14-year-old son introduced me to this series: relatively new, from Rick Riordan.  The Olympians have apparently moved Olympus over the years, following the westward march of civilization - in fact, Olympus is now floating above the Empire State Building in New York City!    The main character is Percy (Perseus) Jackson, who is a half-god (Demigod), introduced in the first book, \\"The Lightning Thief\\". This first book is not as engaging as the following ones, but this is mainly because it first introduces all of the characters and has to give a lot of background quickly.      Each subsequent book covers roughly one year (well, usually one summer) of Percy's adventures.  They generally start out from Camp Half-Blood, the magically protected space on Long Island Sound set aside for Greek/Roman gods' half-human children.  They need this special summer camp for protection from all the monsters and evils that we mere mortals can never see because of \\"the mist\\" that makes us interpret what we see only in ways that make sense to us.  So, that evil substitute teacher might actually be a harpy, sent to weed out another half-blood.  :-)     This creative and engaging series introduces or reinforces ancient myths from Greek and Roman mythology, and does a wonderful job of painlessly increasing cultural literacy for the \\"history of Western Civilization\\".  In fact, it covers many legends beyond that as well, because the premise is that the Olympians have always existed, and they just keep moving their base every few hundred years, through major civilizations on several continents.  Really an awesome series, especially for fairly competent, but possibly reluctant, readers in 8th grade and up.
1416562605|5.0|This is the best insight into the realities of life in the Sub-continent. The analogies used in the book are witty and powerful at the same time and perhaps the one that appeals to the reader the most is that of the chicken coop. This book is brutal, detailed, witty and an absolutely brilliant piece of literature. To me it has become a classic in modern literature and puts to shame the previous winners of the Booker Prize like the rather insipid \\"The Gathering\\". It will not take you long to read this book but you will, through its course, traverse both the glitzy roads of a fast developing India and its much-less-talked-about under belly. The novel is written in the form of a letter composed by the proverbial Indian villager. The narrative is full of sharp wit, emotion and brutal honesty that moves you to the edge of your seat. This has to be one of the finest books to come out in the last few years.

B000NQR7NO|5.0|this does not mean its bad. In fact it's absolutely amazing, its got a plethora of mesmerizing fresh beats and catchy songs such as \\"Fluorescent Adolescent\\" and the relentless drumming of \\"Brianstorm\\".This is a strong sophomoric album from one of the best indie bands of this 21st century.

If you're anything like me, you'll buy it in hardcover, get it signed *and* doodled by Pat, then buy it in paperback, then loan the paperback to a friend who loves it so much he won't give it back, then buy another paperback to take on trips so you won't ruin the signature and doodle.  The only book that could ever be better than Name of the Wind is the sequel, The Wise Man's Fear, which I am desperately waiting for...

B000UBMSB8|5.0|*Spoiler Alert*    I got this four DVD set of Blade Runner just so I could get the original 1982 version, the only version I like. The Director in the intro dismisses this version as the one \\"with Harrison Ford's narration throughout the film\\" and \\"with the improbable ending\\"... But the narration fits with the 1940's detective feel of the movie, and the ending I take as a metaphor for escape from moral ambiguity. Ford's character chooses to see the replicants as human, and he shows this by loving one and leaving the old world he knew behind... And, yes, I like a happy ending...
B00192IV0O|3.0|Like I said, the album was a good dance/rap album, I can gaurantee you'll hear at least one of these tracks in the club some time. Tracks like the hard-hitting and bare-bones \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" have you up and moving alongside other danceable tracks, such as the sound-lush \\"Rock That Body\\", and the good-times \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". As the album progresses towards the end, unfortunately, this seems to die off, and the tracks become relatively hard to listen to, with Fergie wailing in the background to whichever rap will.i.am has sampled in overtop of her.    I've always had a problem with artists who attempt to throw a message into an album, and seemingly at the last minute, like BEP does with The E.N.D. and, come to think of it, with Monkey Business as well. The album follows a basic catalogue of party songs, but with songs like \\"Now Generation\\" and \\"One Tribe\\", BEP attempts to tell us something about ourselves, and provide a social criticism. This is given to us from the same artists who in previous songs claimed that they were too drunk to remember the lyrics, or were expecting late-nite booty calls. \\"Now Generation\\" essentially stands as a anthem to percieved entitlement, childish spoiledness, and a pointlessly thrown-in example of Obama-love. \\"Once Tribe\\" extrapolates on this when will.i.am tells us that in order to progress forward to 'peace' we must actually empty our minds, and become amnesiacs. Hardly solid advice for the future. It seems as if the artists have no actual concept of how to get what they want (Peace? Entitlement? Or maybe just booze. Who knows), but want it nonetheless.    Worthy of three stars, for the musical creativity, but not worthy of more, for the simple fact that it attempts to be intelligent in the end when the entire album negates intelligence, and slowly dies off from its great start.
B001V9LRTM|3.0|Great rendition of the original movie, and the Blu-Ray quality really makes the split screen sequences shine.    My only complaint is my second disk did not contain any of the promised extra 2 hours of musical performances.  The \\"Untold Stories\\" section only had short Woodstock opening and Woodstock closing videos, and had none of the promised extra performances.    Are the extra performances only available on BD Live?    I have a Sony BDP-S350 with the extra memory loaded and firmware update 7.2.019 installed.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I can honestly say that I saw this movie 3 times in the theater and countless times on DVD. This is one of those movies that are made every once in a while like Forrest Gump, The Green Mile or My Life. They don't make movies of this caliber in Hollywood anymore.<br /><br />I was shocked to say the least when I realized that Brad Pitt was to play a role like this. But the same I could say about Tom Hanks when he did Forrest after a vast array of comedies he did before that.<br /><br />There are some similarities between this movie and Forrest but they are completely different stories. It also so happens that the screenwriter was the same one - ERIC ROTH.<br /><br />I was quite dissapointed at the Oscars as I thought this movie was going to clean out and only got 3 awards and the rest was given to Slumdog Millionaire and Sean Penn got the best actor. I guess they were being sympathetic to the gay community because Brad Pitt really did a hell of a job and did deserved the best actor at the oscars this year.<br /><br /> But at least there are people like me that are here to tell you the how grand this movie really is and is worth every penny that you spend on it.<br /><br />RATING 10<br /><br />RAY GAYO 007
0765342294|4.0|Ender's Game             Tom Doherty Associates, New York, 1991, 324 pp.     Orson Scott Card                                   ISBN 0-765-34229-4      Our Hero         \\"Enders Game\\", by Orson Scott Card is a \\"don't want to put book down\\" kind of book. Card's perspective on how one man, or in this case, one boy saving the futuristic universe freo the buggers, which are small and intelligent aliens. Andrew Wiggin, or better known as Ender, is the savior of the future as he fights too many battles to count.       This book is set in one area but in many locations in the future, his Battle school where he firsts goes to space school. Command school where he spends his older days. Lastly, rarely he's on Earth where he starts off and meets his much missed sister Valentine. Orson Scott Card found his inspiration of this book from the book Analog.       As I read through Ender's life, I notice he faces many difficulties. Ender Wiggin is a young, smart, and courageous individual and many people are jealous of that. When he lived on Earth at the age of six, he was in a fight with a bully, but Ender unknowingly killed him in the fight. The government noticed Ender's fighting skill and intellect in his earth school, so they decided to send him into space for battle school. The teachers thought it would be a better idea to isolate him to make him a better student. So, every time he'd get close to somebody, they would transfer him to a new commander or promote him. Ender was once assigned a commander named Bonzo Madrid who was so jealous of Ender's success, he tried to kill him in a fight but ended dead as a result. In Battle School, they have battles that are fake and Ender had numerous odds piled up against him, but he always emerges on top.        Ender Wiggin is such a phenomenal athlete, he skips pre-command school and heads straight to command school, which is unheard of. He is given a simulator, which simulates what would happen if you were fighting Buggers. As he fightsin the simulator, he is undefeated. He is trained by the former, greatest leader of all time who saved the world from the buggers in the second invasion, Mazer Rackham. At the end of command school, Ender is told to go in front of his old teachers and one more simulation but he didn't know it was an actual battle. It was the hardest fight he had ever had, but he came out the victor.        Back on Earth, Enders sister, Valentine, and Enders brother, Peter, are saving Earth their way. They are undercover writers with convincing columns on today's current problems. Their names are Demosthenes and Locke. Their influential columns brought Earth together.        This book was generally a good read, but I think it missed a little. It could have had a better ending and stronger details. The goal was to convince the reader that he or she was witnessing Enders life from his point of view which was mostly reached. Ender reminds me a little of my brother thought. He has so much intelligence and use, but he doesn't know how to use it. This is a very good book and I recommend it to anybody who likes science fiction books and space.    By,  Pablo Pepper
0553582445|2.0|This review pertains to the entire series, Tawny Man books 1-3.  There are some things to like in this series, but in my accounting, more things not to like.  Just as with the original trilogy it reads like a fantasy soap opera.  Lots of relationship issues with less emphasis on plot or action.  As with the original series, everyone misunderstands Fitz, takes advantage of him, gets angry at him for a variety of misunderstandings, perceived wrongs and then hold perpetual grudges against him for that.  These somewhat irritating and obvious \\"Days of Our Lives\\" scenarios drive the storyline from one part to the next.  The story itself drags on interminably in some parts with little reward at the end.  In the first series there was a very irritating section where the entire story revolved around Fitz trying to help the king, Regal busting in and accusing him of treason...repeat ad nauseum until you want to throw the book in the fire for sheer boredom.  This series has an analogous section where Thick gets mad at Fitz and plays skill-pranks on him every time he tries to help him...over, and over, and over, and over.  Hobb, if you have run out of ideas, how about you just stop writing and move on?  Finally I would say that the 3rd book has the ignominious distinction of all the fantasy I have ever read, of having the most interminable, boring and pointless anticlimax which literally extends for hundreds of pages (I lost count).  The male characters are ascribed very feminine traits which make them less believable to a male reader.  I have read somewhere in the area of 500 fantasy novels in my life and up until this point I have eschewed female authors because I perceived that gender would influence the character, if not quality, of the writing.  I have admonished myself for this bias in the past.  I hate to say it, but reading this series has only served to confirm those prejudices.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I had never really listened to Coldplay, however, I found in my Entertainment Weekly Magazine that if you give them your email address they will allow you to download this album for free- its a Thank-you to their fans. How awesome is that? They got my respect points right there!! :-) I then downloaded and found out that they have some very good lyrics on this CD. The music was definately well-written/composed. Thanks Coldplay for expanding my music interests- I can say I am one of your fans now! :-)
1933771690|5.0|I must concur with all of the thoughtful reviews so far presented that Robert Lanza and Bob Berman have crafted a beautifully written account of a potentially revolutionary idea. Where as most current cosmological theories represent life and consciousness as emergent, and even accidental, properties of an otherwise lifeless universe. Dr. Lanza proposes, to the contrary, that life and consciousness are actually fundamental properties of the universe and all that it represents, so much so that the universe cannot possibly exist without life to give it reality.    From this simple idea, some might immediately assume that Dr. Lanza is seeking to justify a form of Intelligent Design or Creationism, but that would be a huge mistake. Dr. Lanza is a consummate scientist who fully embraces the latest knowledge that science has brought us, from evolutionary theory to relativity and quantum mechanics. His biocentrism, in fact, proposes to make sense of some of the most perplexing discoveries that quantum mechanics has revealed together with Einsteinian relativity, and he does this in the most engaging, patient (to this layman), and conversational style, with a minimum of mathematics. He even takes the time to explain the little math that he uses for the most innumerate among us to understand.    Basically, he contends that any unobserved universe can only exist in a state of probability that requires living observation and measurement to give it any certain reality. Some have assumed that Lanza refers only to human consciousness and question the idea on this very basis: what gave the universe reality before humans arrived? However, it is clear that he is referring to consciousness as it exists, to one degree or another, in all forms of life, known and unknown. While for an individual, what is not perceived may not exist for them, clearly the larger reality is far more complex than that, and such, at the very least, is the work that remains to be understood.    A previous reviewer draws a distinction between Robert Lanza's biocentrism and Stephen Hawking's sense of the \\"RWOT (Real World Out There).\\" However, from a recent article on Dr. Hawking's latest thinking, it appears that Lanza and Hawking may actually be converging on the same point. Hawking is quoted in the July/August 2009 issue of Discover magazine as follows (\\"Return of the Invisible Man,\\" pp. 50-51):    \\"Hawking's most recent work explores the implications of the notion that the universe is a giant quantum phenomenon. The problem with conventional attempts to understand the cosmos, he now believes, is that researchers have failed to appreciate the full, bizarre implications of quantum physics. These efforts to create a unique theory that would explain all the properties of the universe are therefore doomed to fail. Hawking refers to such attempts as `bottom-up' theories because they assume the universe had a unique beginning and that its subsequent history was the only possible one.    \\"Hawking is now pushing a different strategy, which he calls top-down cosmology. It is not the case, he says, that the past uniquely determines the present. Because the universe has many possible histories and just as many possible beginnings, the present state of the universe selects the past. `This means that the histories of the Universe depend on what is being measured,' Hawking wrote in a recent paper, `contrary to the usual idea that the Universe has an objective, observer-independent history.'\\"    Dr. Lanza insists that future theories of the universe will be biocentric in nature. That Dr. Hawking might agree, in a complete reversal from his past writing about this, certainly raises the most intriguing of possibilities, does it not?
0330449605|5.0|This is a great second book for Morton. I love her writing style and her topics. I also love the way she unfolds things and slowly reveals the plot. I do have to say though that I preferred her first book \\"The House at Riverton\\". It was much harder to put down and had me absolutely enthralled - which is hard to do. \\"Forgotten Garden kept me in suspense but I figured the plot out too early and this made it less suspenseful.  But it was a great book, well thought out and well researched. I can't wait for her next one!
0393312836|3.0|Although I agree that this work is certainly deserving of the term \\"enduring\\", having read the re-published \\"British\\" edition I feel that it falls short of deserving the categorization of \\"masterpiece\\". In the introduction, Burgess himself claims that he is unhappy with the fact that Clockwork is his best-known work and insists that the original \\"American\\" and Kubrick movie versions were incomplete. Those versions end with the 20th chapter, instead of the 21st that the British and most other editions were published with. To not risk giving out spoilers, I will simply say that personally, I disagree with Burgess and feel that the book would have been more of a masterpiece if all versions ended with the 20th chapter.<br /><br />The dialect that the narrator uses is at first hard to understand. Thankfully, I quickly got used to it, but the first few chapters were rough and I honestly think the book would have been just as good if Burgess had used proper English and not the made-up slang he actually used. Also, it was admittedly a bit difficult to read through the extreme amount of violence written into the story, although of course the novel would not have had the same impact without that. In the end, although I think this book raises interesting questions and was a great story, because of the aforementioned things I simply can't rate it at more than 3 out of 5 stars.
0679721037|3.0|This book is about the nuclear bomb that dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. It's about a handful of people who survived the bomb and how they helped other people to survive too. They go through lots of pain and sickness but still survived to tell about it, at the end of the book it has the characters from the book (who were based on real people) real eye-witness accounts from them personally. This is a good book if you are learning a bout World War 2 or learning about the effects of the atomic bomb.

B001UN1KVE|5.0|I love the film so it was a no-brainer to get it for the store, and my slight disappointment is offset with showing what a high storage capacity can do for this product.<br /><br />The package comes with both the BD and the standard def discs and included are all of the special features we know from the 2005 release. So what's changed? Nothing except for the languages: Dubbed in DTS for six languages (including Castilian, German, Italian and French) and Mono or Dolby for three others, and subtitled in nine languages (incl. Danish, Swedish and Norwegian). None of the supplements have been upgraded but that DTS always sounds awesome during the main feature. The picture has not been cleaned up from the transfer so there is plenty of artifact, hair and random film discolorations. I enjoyed watching some of the same special features again, including the John Candy memorial and the Mel Brooks conversation. The ludiricous speed is just as lame as before.<br /><br />The menu is a killer if your player is not tuned up (or older). It becomes painful when trying to watch those flubs sequences as there is no play all option. It is Spaceballs, it is Mel Brooks - so it makes it a worthwhile purchase if you did not already upgrade a few years ago to that special edition DVD (especially with both included here). I would normally rate this lower but there is so much here I had to go up one.

B0017R5UAA|2.0|Ever hear \\"Longer Boats\\" by Cat Stevens on his Tea for the Tillerman LP?  Well \\"Fleet Foxes\\" is what you get when you make a whole disc of tunes that ape that sound, those harmonies, and that vibe.  Maybe the next effort will scale the mighty \\"Velvet Underground\\"?  And why not, there's nothing called plagiarism in popular music...  Fun listen but you might prefer original artists like Wilco, the Shins, or Radiohead for real excitement.

B0011BGY66|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but after listening to this album almost non-stop for a couple weeks, I felt I had to share my feelings with somebody.  This album is simply brilliant from beginning to end.  I originally heard the song \\"A-Punk\\" on the radio and got the band name from the Shazam App on my T-Mobile G1.  I loved the song so much I ended up buying the whole thing from the Amazon app (on the same phone).  And I really haven't stopped listening to it since.  The album has an overall Indy rock kind of feel to it... but the sound is more refined.  It's like Indy rock with some of the edges cleaned off.. and some string instruments thrown in for good measure.  None of these songs are simple in their structure although they might sound like it at first.  I think is simply because they are well-crafted songs.  Upon repeated listening you hear more layers and detail which has been put into each song.  Pretty much every song on the album is sing-along catchy, but never comes across as overly sweet (or over-medicated).  If I had to deconstruct the band down to some basic ingredients I would say... Sonic Youth framework... with Cake listenability... a bit of the Strokes for intensity... a tiny dash of the Clash [mostly because \\"Kid's don't Stand a Chance\\" reminds me of \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\\"]... and some Peter Gabriel just for fun (listen to the album and you'll get what I mean).<br /><br />I love this album and this band.  I can't wait to hear more from them.

1400063515|4.0|This is an interesting book that provides some much needed criticism of how people in science, financial services, trading, and other fields too readily accept --and too often apply-- the Gaussian (or \\"normal\\") distrbution without justification. I enjoyed it, and I believe that it contains some valuable lessons.     So, why did I give it four stars instead of five?   Mostly, because Mr. Taleb muddles it up with his morality and his obsession with certain persons (or ideal personalities). Although a bit long-winded, I did enjoy some of his writing about his friends and acquaintences, and how he appreciates qualities other than those usually idealized in academia (or finance or business for that matter).     My most important disagreement with Mr. Taleb is about his moral assertions that it is \\"unfair\\" for some people to make more money (or otherwise prosper more) than others. Sometimes it is, but often it is not unfair. He seems to believe that success or failure is primarily and most often determined by randomness. This implies that it would be preferable to have a society in which everyone had equal income (and wealth). The problem is that some people do succeed because of their hard work, and to me it is immoral to say that it would be OK to re-distribute the products of their labor to those who have not succeeded so well (some because of \\"bad luck\\", but others truly for lack of effort).     As I see it, Mr. Talebs morality, if accepted, would justify socialism.     He cites science as a career path in which one has the opportunity to benefit from positive black swans (rare, but great success brought on by unforeseen discovery). I very much agree. I have been working as a scientist for the past ten years, and only recently I have experienced such a positive black swan. Certainly, I could not have predicted it beforehand.   Although I feel very \\"lucky\\" to have found what I found, I do not entirely discount the role of my own effort in making that finding possible,nor the hard work of any other scientist in making his or her discoveries. Had I not studied hard, checked and double checked my calculations, there is no way that I would have found what I found.     So, the major flaw I see in this book comes from its authors morality. Other than that, I very much liked this book.
B00192IV0O|1.0|the new craze..what annoys me even more is how they market garbage like this along with T Pain,Kanye etc. as hip hop. The four basic elements of hip hop are mc'ing,dj'ing,graf writing and b-boying, none of which is present in any of this commercial crap being thrown into the market these days...i do believe though that when true hip hop rears its head again, acts like these will jump on the bandwagon hoping to score some street cred. If record company execs are going to market this sorry excuse for music to the masses, call it something else..pop hop,hip pop,poppy cock..i don't care, but don't destroy a whole culture by labeling this as hip hop...as for b.e.p, hope you save some of that dough for a rainy day cos when your sales eventually start to fall, your label will kick you to the curb faster than you can say monkey business...
0060920084|3.0|Fans of Bill Bryson will enjoy this book.  He's up to his usual hilarious self, with observations about America (late 1980s) that will make you laugh so hard you have to put the book down.  Unfortunately, I found his occasional political observations out of place, ill-tempered and unnecessary.  Without those, it would have been a much better book.

B0027MJU00|5.0|Told in the voices of victims and survivors, Dark Places is a superb sophomore novel by Gillian Flynn. She captures the dark side and seedy underbelly of rural poverty. The narrative, told in an hour by hour style, keeps you turning the pages to find out what happens next. Whether you are following the mother (who is a victim - not giving away any secrets) the lone surviving daughter in search of the truth, or the brother who was convicted of the murders of his family, the pieces leading up to the nightmare unfold slowly - you already know the final outcome.When I finished, I didn't know whether to take a really hot shower or sleep with the lights on. As a bookseller, this book is not for everyone, but it's a WOW for those who love a great psychological thriller. Gillian Flynn makes every one of your senses come to life with her vivid storytelling.
0765350386|4.0|Very good, innovative system of magic, ambiguity in what is right and wrong, good and evil and the consequences of what is perceived to be the correct choice at the time makes the story intriguing. Did Vin and Elend do the right thing? Will have to read the rest of the series to find out.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I've been using an N52 for years.  I finally picked up the G13 to check it out, and I'm quite impressed.  The feel is solid and comfortable.  It doesn't scoot around on the table.  The size and proportions are fixed, but fit my hand nicely.  (I have large-ish but not ogre-sized hands.  Smaller handed people might want to look elsewhere)    The thumb joystick is surprisingly comfortable to use.  With a little practice, I can hold a direction for a while by leaning/resting my thumb against it rather than pushing.  The joystick down-click is hard to accidentally set off -- it's also a little difficult to click without moving the stick, so set that to something that you won't be using all the time, and not at the same time as movement.    The divots for the keys where WASD would be are nice, but I could have had them be a little deeper.  When I was first getting used to the G13, I would tend to miss my home finger position sometimes, but I got used to it.  I suppose I was spoiled by keyboards with big dimples on them for home row reference.    Button press has a good feel to it.    The LED and LCD setup is pretty cool, but I don't pay much attention to it while gaming.  One caution here: there are four buttons across the top.  Three of those change mode, one of them starts you recording.  The buttons are all the same shape and size, unlike my G15 keyboard's big round MR (macro record) button.  I haven't had a problem with it, but then again I don't swap modes very often.    The new software package for Logitech controllers is very very well done.  It handles keyboard and controller both, and you can store your profile into the gamepad to carry it around.  It's vastly improved over last year's software for the G15.    Overall, I give this an unhesitating endorsement.  The downsides are very minor and easily avoided or adjusted to.  The upsides eclipse any drawbacks, and I can keep on gaming with minimal wear and tear on my wrists.    My N52, battle worn veteran, is finally retired.

1848310293|5.0|The development of quantum physics through the 20th century is one of the great adventures of science, and here at last is a book aimed at the layperson which clearly explains its key concepts, while situating the scientific development in its broader setting. The result is a challenging and enthralling read.<br /><br />Quantum is appropriately sub-titled, Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate about the Nature of Reality. The long theoretical duel between these two giants of modern physics is a recurring theme of the book, but the story starts before them with the build-up to the discovery of Planck's constant at the turn of the century, and continues beyond their deaths (in 1955 and 1962 respectively) to take in Bell's Theorem and Everett's \\"many worlds\\" interpretation. Along the way we meet other great physicists such as Rutherford, Heisenberg, Pauli, Schr&ouml;dinger, Dirac and Bohm.<br /><br />One might suspect that a book of such scope would be in danger of being overcrowded with theories and theorists, yet Kumar rises to the challenge, displaying a novelist's sense of pacing allied with an impressive scientific clarity and succinctness. Clearly he has taken to heart the famous injunction attributed to Einstein to \\"make it as simple as possible, but no simpler!\\" He also strikes a judicious balance between scientific explanation and human context. This provided for me a welcome alternation between the physics and the lives of the physicists, with each stimulating an interest in the other.<br /><br />What is so powerful and inspiring about this book is the way it conveys the passion for truth of those great pioneers. No doubt ego played its part as well, they would hardly have been human otherwise, but it is always secondary to the great quest to fathom the nature of sub-atomic reality. Characteristic of this passion is the anecdote of Bohr and Einstein on their first meeting in Copenhagen, straightaway so engrossed in debate that they repeatedly miss their bus-stop. Kumar evidently resonates to this passion, and conveys it vividly in his narrative. Here is an extract from his account of Bohr's first meeting with Schr&ouml;dinger, one of Einstein's key allies in the great debate:<br /><br />\\"After the exchange of pleasantries, battle began almost at once, and according to Heisenberg, `continued daily from early morning until late at night'... During one discussion Schr&ouml;dinger called `the whole idea of quantum jumps a sheer fantasy'. `But it does not prove there are no quantum jumps,' Bohr countered. All it proved, he continued, was that `we cannot imagine them'. Emotions soon ran high... Schr&ouml;dinger finally snapped. `If all this damned quantum jumping were really here to stay, I should be sorry I ever got involved with quantum theory.' `But the rest of us are extremely grateful that you did,' Bohr replied, `your wave mechanics has contributed so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics.'<br /><br />\\"After a few days of these relentless discussions, Schr&ouml;dinger fell ill and took to his bed. Even as his wife did all she could to nurse their house-guest, Bohr sat on the edge of the bed and continued the argument. `But surely Schr&ouml;dinger, you must see...' He did see, but only through the glasses he had long worn, and he was not about to change them for ones prescribed by Bohr.\\"<br /><br />This book is a brilliant and compelling account of the genesis of quantum physics, but it is more than that. In the midst of today's pervasive cynicism and disorientation, it is an inspiring reminder of what the human spirit is capable of when it devotes itself passionately to the highest aim, that of understanding the truth of our reality.to this passion, and conveys it vividly in his narrative.

B00000I9P1|4.0|While not as successful in the charts as Vital Signs, When Seconds Count is still a great set of songs. Sure, it's very slick, very 1980s and cheesy at times with the amount of synthesizers used, but still an enjoyable listen. Very addictive album, and a good follow-up to Vital Signs. I imagine it would have fared better in the charts had Burning Heart been added to it.    My favorite songs from this album:    Is this Love  How Much Love  Rebel Son  Oceans  Keep it Right Here  When Seconds Count
B001GQACGO|5.0|Though I've loved Beyonce for years, it took me a while to buy one of her albums. All I can say is, I made the right choice! I've heard \\"B'Day\\" (I bought the Deluxe Edition just for \\"Flaws n' All,\\" but after a first listen, I could not comprehend why they'd ruin such an amazingly beautiful, touching song by adding some weird scratching background sound. Horrible. Plus, many of the other songs were too thumpy-rappy, making \\"Flaws n' All\\" feel awkwardly out of place. In fact, they should have added \\"Flaws n' All' to \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\"! I returned the CD.) OK, enough about \\"B'Day.\\"<br /><br />If you love Beyonce for her gorgeous vocals (which her hip-hop/rap/street songs do not showcase, to say the least), \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce\\" is the CD for you. The minute you hear the first track, you'll notice that Beyonce's growth as a singer is undeniable and exciting. This is a 2-disc release and yes, I've read the complaints about the two CDs being wildly different, what's the point, etc. While it might have been nice for the entire album to be ALL ballads and songs that truly showcase her vocals, I have to say her singing is featured first and foremost on all tracks, which makes the whole album very enjoyable, in part because of the disparity, and, bottom line, it's Beyonce at her very best. Now in her late 20s, her voice is richer and stronger, and we're hearing her gifted range like never before. She's also sounding more confident at this stage, as she should. This is the Beyonce from Oscar night 2005, when she belted out an unprecedented three-song set. Those performances blew me away and she definitely left me wanting more. This is the big, bold, beautiful voice I hear on \\"I Am...Sasha Fierce.\\"<br /><br />The first CD - her softer, slower, more personal collection - is just that, and all the songs are beautiful in their own way. These are true, classic ballads (such as \\"Halo\\"), and you're treated to one whole CD of beautifully written songs and incomparable vocals. But when I'm in the mood to crank up \\"Single Ladies,\\" in goes the second CD, her \\"Sasha Fierce\\" side. It's definitely more pumped up, but almost none of the songs fall into the earlier hip-hop/Jay-Z-inspired style of many of the B'Day songs, for example. The second \\"Fierce\\" CD songs are definitely lively and witty, yet still melodic and varied. But again, her voice is what you hear, not all the noise. You can't go wrong with this album.
B001WCN23W|1.0|So what Virgin didn't get it right in 94? How anyone can justify the difference in sound quality to buying Stick Fingers or any post-ABCKO release for the third time now is absolutely beyond me. The whole remastering scam was warranted in the early 90's, but the Stones don't even add additional tracks or linear notes to these. I'll wait for the 2021 50th anniversary remastered edition. Seriously, how many times does Mick want me to buy his 70's library - which let's be honest, outside of Sticky and Exile stunk anyway.

0743496736|4.0|How many of us have been where Peter Houghton was, have witnessed or been subjected to the kind of treatment he endured?  How many of us have listened as our children either spoke or we subsequently learned of their being the victim or the tormentor? How many have witnessed or learned of the aftermath...brutality, suicide?  There was so much pain in this book.  Peter Houghton, the outcast teen, the one who did not fit in from kindergarten on, the one who was unmercifully teased, thin, bespactacled, unathletic, sensitive, friendless, misunderstood...turns into a killer as he guns down his tormentors and innocents in a high school massacre.  The high school students, victims themselves, administering some innocent teasing, then unwittingly judging and becoming cruel and impervious to understanding, taking it one after another step to a right of passage.   Where was their guidance and example...it cost them their lives.   It is such a sad story.  It should awaken every reader to safeguard and respect every being, to be loving and positive guides, to be inclusive, to be kind, to recognize distress, to get and give support.  We have come so far and yet we haven't come far enough!
B002BI4Y06|1.0|There's 17 songs on the album.  It's listed at $16.99.  You can buy the tracks individually for 99 cents each.<br /><br />So ... if you download each of the songs individually, you save 16 cents.<br /><br />The download should cost less, seeing as the physical products are less.  I think it's a snafu of some sort -- which is a shame because this is a great album at the first listen.  The guys are really in top form.<br /><br />If they fix the pricing, or better yet, make it the download value of the day at some point -- pick it up then.  But until that happens, get the CD or video disc -- DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!

B00027JYLC|4.0|I had seen bit and pieces of this on TV, then its segment on Bravo's scariest movie's TV show.    I'm glad I rented it, it was still chilling to this day, maybe for some different reasons, bt it's still a great movie.    I can imagine what people thought of it in the 30's, and why they felt it had to be banned.    The copy I watched had some audio-visual issues, I think it took place during the transfere, not the filiming.    I give this movie a B.
B001MEJY8W|4.0|I'm finding it difficult to properly and sensibly review this film. No film in recent or past history has left me as disturbed and almost confused about how I feel about it as Martyrs did. I felt the film was exceptionally well made with a very original and VERY dark storyline. I'm a huge horror and gore fan, but I'm not quite sure this film fits in that category. Its something more, something that is nearly in a class by itself.     Its hard to review a movie like this, at least for me. Did I like the film? Yes. But I'm almost not sure why. Its a brilliant film, so original, so well made, but its almost like those factors are also what makes this movie so disturbing. Martyrs has taken disturbing and depressing to a whole new level. Its violent and bloody sure, but there are worse out there. But its not just the violence or blood that leaves the uneasy feeling, its the movie as a whole. The subject matter, storyline, darkness, combined with the violence and blood created probably the most disturbingly original, nearly disgusting, yet brilliantly made film I quite possibly have ever seen. See the problem trying to review this film? Its one of the most original, yet horribly disturbing films I've seen.     Unfortunately, I cannot see any replay value here. After seeing this film once regardless of how wonderfully made it is, how original it is, how different it is, I simply cannot see myself ever watching it again. Although watching it once has truly been an experience, it is just so bizarre, dark, and depressing that I would never sit through it again.     I've never felt this way about any film before, which says something for the quality and originality of it. If you've ever wanted to see one of, if not the most disturbing film ever made give this a try. Its a great movie that is almost hard to comprehend that will disturb you many days after viewing it.

B00102F5WK|5.0|Quite a good message movie.    The message, quite clearly, is: When you torture (suspected) terrorists, you become a terrorist yourself, and perpetuate the vicious cycle.    This happens to the police official.  While torturing the (presumably) innocent Egyptian/American, he also rounds up and tortures the brother of Khalid, which pushes Khalid into suicide-bombing--and that kills Khalid's girlfriend, the police official's daughter.    The CIA officer (Jake Gyllenhaal) sums it up: When you torture (and often kill) one terrorist, you create hundreds more.    The goal of terrorists is to make you act as badly as they say you do.  When you do, you prove their point and swell their numbers.    A secondary message: besides being immoral and counterproductive, torture produces no useful info.    Good acting, interesting editing, wonderful photography, a lot of intensity and suitable horror.    Good film.

0345350499|5.0|The \\"Mists of Avalon\\" was my first foray into the fantasy genre and it would be years before I would find anything that came close to measuring up to novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley. This book has the perfect blend of magic, romance and action.<br /><br />This book tells the Arthurian legend through the eyes of the women around King Arthur's life. It tells the story of the strength of Igraine (his mother), Morgain (his sister), and Guinevere (his wife). It's a compelling sotry that shows us the bravery of these three women in such brutal times, without taking away the romance and the insecurity's these three women feel.<br /><br />If you liked this you will probably like the \\"Forest House\\" and \\"Lady of the Lake\\">  They take place before The Mists of Avalon although Bradley wrote them after she worite this book. I read this first and was eager to read her other books, I was not disappointed. It would be many years before I would find another fantasy series I loved as much as I did these.  (The first 6 books in Terry Good kind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series).

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Clint Eastwood has become an icon, not just for his iconic film roles over the very long career he has had, but also for his outstanding directing. Ironically enough, the movies where he is the director AND main actor, are the ones that shine the most. (Example. \\"Pale Rider\\" and \\"Unforgiven\\")    \\"Gran Torino\\" is expertly directed and acted by Eastwood and brings that classic touch that only he can do. His character, \\"Walt\\", is not likeable at all in the beginning and many may feel that way even through the end. He is an angry man, mad at the world and all of the problems the world has caused him. He is a veteran of the Korean war--a war the U.S. lost. He is a recent widower and his two sons and their families have little to do with him unless they need something. His neighborhood is deteriorating around him. He is a racist, pure and simple, non-apologetic about it.     With all of that said, you might wonder if there is anything redeeming about the character of \\"Walt\\" or the movie. A resounding, yes. The movie traces \\"Walt\\" as he goes from being that grumpy old man in the neighborhood who doesn't want to have a thing to do with his neighbors, particularly the Asian ones living next door, to being the same grumpy old man, but mellowing out as he befriends the Asian teenager and his sister next door.     While his own family doesn't need him and views him somewhat as a burden or annoyance, the Asian family next door needs him to help with getting an Asian gang from leaving them alone. \\"Walt\\" sees a young teenager who has potential and knows that he needs to help him out with some tough love and being like a big brother. The scenes are classic and enduring. The chemistry between Eastwood and the actors who portray brother and sister is spot on.     The pacing of the movie is good and you are never bored. I was always excited as to see what would happen next and Eastwood didn't disappoint.     Many might find the movie as not politically correct and I think that is a good thing. Political correctness has its place, I guess, but in movies, I don't see a reason. Eastwood's character was shaped by a hard life and war and he doesn't mince words and tells it like it is. It is one of his best acting performances by far in recent years.     Overall, \\"Gran Torino\\" is fine Hollywood filmmaking at its best. You will thoroughly enjoy this movie and yes the title is a reference to Eastwood's character's car which has underlying significance to the story.    4/5 stars
0385340575|5.0|I've read everything by Lee Child and find him one of the better writers in this genre. So I was surprised to see only a 3.5 star rating when I got this book. I read it anyway because it's Child and his character Jack Reacher. It was very good, intense and riveting.   It's at least a 4.5 book, so I checked out the reviews to see what had happened. Specifically, I checked out the reviews that were one star. Turns out those reviews were given by people who didn't like the price of the Kindle version of this book. Turns out their one star reviews were a protest against Amazon.com and have nothing to do with the quality of the writing. Now that's really intelligent.
B001T7XXK2|4.0|A sweet yet engrossing little British television show with a really seriously top notch cast. A mite bit sacharine at times, but absolutely well worth watching nonetheless. And -- as anyone who has watched the show will empathise with -- I loved tuning in to see what the postmistress's 'one weakness' would be each episode!    Highly recommended, especially for fans of Cranford, and for anyone who loves to see stars from such shows as Ab Fab and Coupling, to name but a few.    I'm glad to see series 2 has been made, and I for one can't wait to see it.

Just listen to the rhythm section on Dear Mr Fantasy, the bass line is easily discernible without being too prominent. Musically this concert is enough to make a middle aged man like me cry.

B0024RID6U|5.0|Start Me Up.  Or, Re-Start Me Up.  This is another \\"turning point\\" album in the band's history.  We have now left the disco/jet-set era of Black and Blue, Some Girls, and Emotional Rescue.  As \\"Hang Fire\\" on this album points out, \\"Inheriting money is a full time job/I don't need the aggravation/I'm a lazy slob...\\"  This album is a reflection of that sentiment:  The band almost seems to cast off the heavy mantle of its already-heavy legacy to that point and gets back to basics.<br /><br />The simple C-G riff of \\"Start Me Up\\" is as infectious a hook as any in the Stones catalog and the whole album pretty much continues that way.<br />\\"Little T&A\\" is a (slightly) less in-your-face version of \\"Respectable\\" from the Some Girls album just three years earlier.  Instead of \\"dropping heroin with the the President,\\" we're content to hear Keith wax poetic about his \\"little rock and roll.\\"  \\"Neighbors\\" is a goofy little rant.<br /><br />The album does get a bit ponderous on side 2, as those of us who bought the vinyl album when both we and the album were new will remember.  \\"Tops\\" and \\"Heaven\\" are in contrast both in sound and attitude vs the rest of the album, which neverthless ends in the simple, bittersweet \\"Waiting on a Friend.\\"  The TV commercials when the album come out showed Mick with his arm slung over Keith's shoulder, walking down a city street with this song in the background.<br /><br />This album ushers in two notable elements in the band's history:<br />1) A thinning of Charlie Watts' drums to reflect the early-80's fad of electronic percussion.  The beats are still there, but the drums don't have that F-A-T maple shells and stretched skins sound of yore -- i.e. \\"Carol\\" on the live Get Yer Ya Ya's Out album.  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:  This comment is not to be taken as the sound on THIS PARTICULAR 2009 remaster is not up to snuff.  OVERALL, THIS AND THE REST OF THE 2009 REMASTERS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY BETTER, PUNCHIER, BASSIER, AND MEATIER THAN THOSE WHICH CAME BEFORE, INCLUDING THE 2005 VIRGIN O-CARDS (which of course, really weren't \\"remasters\\" per se).<br />2) The Rolling Stones become The Rolling StonesTM.

0756405890|5.0|There are a few people who don't like this book, and honestly not everyone will like it.  For those that enjoy reading Fantasy, who like strong central characters, for those who like mysterious characters, and for those who enjoy the telling of the story - then this is the book for you.  For people who want to be blown out of their mind by life-changing events and explosions and wars and people dying - this is not the book for you.  Go get a Steven Erikson book, you'll like him.    As it is by itself, the book is incomplete.  Its finishes leaving you wanting to know more, and for every question that gets answered it leaves you with more questions.  I am sure that the second book is going to have a lot more action and adventure in it than the first one, but it was also have an equal amount of story development and plot twisting - in other words, if you don't like a good character-driven story (like Robin Hobb's books) then this isn't the book for you.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|I realise 'In Treatment' is a remake, but I can't shake the feeling it still feels experimental...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's a terrific show. The emotions running through each character feel honest and believable and every single actor delivers a brilliant performance (there are NO weak-links). The script is sharp and intelligent, and despite the lack of different locations it draws you in. I was never once bored when watching the 40+, 30 minute episodes.<br /><br />This show also feels realistic. For me shows that feature realism are always interesting but seem to forget the fact that the ultimate goal is to entertain it's audience. 'In Treatment' is aware of this and (especially in the first few episodes) feels like it's trying to make the audience ignore the fact that we're mostly just watching people talk. Some characters seem like they're monologing and just seem a bit too comfortable displaying every little emotion. This isn't a bad thing, and sort of gives it that indie (fore-mentioned \\"experimental\\") feel, but doesn't really make you forget you just spent the last 30 minutes watching a conversation.<br /><br />Oh, and there are no extras on the DVD's (unless I'm totally missing something). The show's good enough, but I would've loved to see interviews with the cast (especially since there's a new cast for season 2). To me no extras just feel like a missed opportunity with DVD sets. I realise you're mostly buying the DVD's for the show itself, but considering you can stream most episodes online it kinda makes you think twice before purchasing this DVD set.<br /><br />With television shows these days trying to 'out-create' each other, it's nice to see a series that truly does more with less. Despite my complaints, this show is definitely worth owning (at Amazon's price of $34.99 when everyone else is charging $50+).
0452295548|3.0|I was expecting an Oliver Sacks sort of experience, in which she both provided us with a great deal of scientific information regarding the brain, thoughts and consciousness while simultaneously weaving us a larger narrative in which she pondered more existential questions about the nature of being and consciousness itself.  That's not this book.  Rather, the book has an odd sort of disjointed feel to it.<br /><br />The first chapter explains how own unique perspective on the stroke experience.  SHe was both a researcher in psychology and anatomy at harvard University, and an individual with a great deal of personal experience in the fields of psychology and consciousness.  She describes growing up with a schizophrenic brother who was a mere year and a half older than herself -- thus, from the beginnings of her life, she has been fascinated with questions about how our brains work, what we perceive and why as humans sometimes perceive things so differently.<br /><br />By far the best chapter in my mind is the second, where she describes what actually happened the morning she had her stroke -- on both a physiological and emotional level.  In essence, she reconstructs the event, noting that \\"I was feeling this while this was happening in this section of my brain.\\"  She explains, for example, why it was impossible to dial 911, since during the experience she would have been hard pressed to understand what a phone was, what one did with it, what numbers were or how they related to the telephone.<br /><br />The chapters on her recovery are where the book starts to get weak.  Her overall message in the last half of the book is admirable, but somewhat poorly executed.  However, her overall message, that she chose to reconstruct many of the skills and experiences of her earlier life, but that she enjoyed the \\"blessing\\" of leaving the emotional baggage behind, of grabbing hold of the experiences without grabbing hold of the emotions which they engendered, is excellent -- and fascinating.  It calls into question big issues like \\"who am I and where does my identity come from.  If I change my history, my past and how I feel about situations, am I in essence now a different person?\\"  But it's a message that shouldn't have taken seventy some pages to convey, nor will everyone else's experience necessarily parallel her own.  Worth a quick read, but not the solid, weighty analysis I was expecting.calls into question big issues like \\"who am I and where does my identity come from.

0316044695|3.0|Marcus Luttrell is a true hero- as are ALL members of the U.S. Navy SEALs. I have read probably every single book about the SEALs ( fact & fiction ) ever written. Nothing - except the regular feeling of helplessness the SEALs sometimes felt in that brutal land- was a surprise or new to me. I ahve spent some time around SEALs in the past and know what universe they travel in. Luttrell has a certain ability to communicate the human experience of this universe, and this gave the narrative balance and meaning. As a SEAL fanatic, I read this, despite a busy schedule, in just a few days.     However, his lecturing from his extremely right-wing mindset was off-putting to the point where I skipped a few pages at a time ( which I HATED to do ). It came off as periodic rants which often were completely off-target ( which is unusual for a SEAL ). If you are reading this Mr. Luttrell , please read on. Some of us \\"liberals\\" aren't limp-wristed tree-huggers but robust \\"progressives\\" who just want to cut the Major B.S. and get to the truth. On the contrary, some of us are martial art experts, combat Vets, and hard-nosed contributors to the security and welfare of our commuties. Got that ?? We think Iraq was a massive mistake, the imposing Afgani-Pakistani border is the true frontline, that our fighting men MUST have the BEST equipment, care, benefits ( including MUCH better VA ), THE NEW G.I. BILL which WE made happen, and so many more issues of support that your right-wing brothers denied you and fought tooth & nail against US in their usual corrupt ways. O.K. that's my rant. Wish I could buy you a beer and discuss...    However- READ THIS BOOK. Mr. Luttrell does a great job bringing us into the brave and terrifying world they inhabit, and makes us value the great sacrifice and inner power these magnificent warriors give to us all. We are so lucky they exist. We love you guys and if I could have been strong enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with you on that fateful June 2005 day, it would have been an honor.

0756405890|5.0|I had to write a review after seeing a few folks giving this book only 1 star. Seriously, 1 star? The only way anyone would rate this book with 1 star is they are so dumb they thought it was food and tried to eat the book instead of read it and were rating it on taste (which im sure the author will admit is a bit plain but a good source of fiber). Read the book and you will find its a great fantasy novel, deserving of many stars.

159448385X|5.0|Yes , I just finished Khaled Hosseini's second masterpiece and I am at cross roads of trying to pen down what the pages made me think and feel. Interestingly, I still haven't completed the Kite Runner but this one, I couldn't put down for a second. The first thing that strikes you about the book is the fact that it is the story of the lives of 2 women amidst a battered Afghanistan, spanning several decades, but more importantly, it is a story written by a man, completely from a woman's perspective. This is even more striking when you realize that this is the same author who made his readers' eyes sting with the accounts of \\"Baba Jaan\\" in the Kite Runner.    I am in no way qualified to critique this masterpiece but I don't want to lose the essence that it left me in me today. As one reads the book, one is made brutally aware of the atrocities that are lashed out on women in different levels of society in different ways. One feels a sense of revulsion towards fundamentalism in all its forms. One is apalled at how close to truth, some of these pages probably are. Yes, the storyline speaks to one geographical area and one socio-political community, and yet as I went through the pages, the paragraphs that left my face moist with tears were not the ones that shouted atrocities, rather the ones that would resonate with any woman today, in any part of the world, in any community, in any faith.    Whether it was the unshed tears of an incomplete love story, or the sorrow of a woman to lose her child even before the little one made an appearence in this world; whether it was the joy of the same woman to find opportunities where she could be a mother in ways that completed her very existence without ever giving birth; whether it was that friend who would kill for you; that friend who would die so you could live your dreams; at the end of the day this was a story of the best and worst facets of human relationships. No one is without frailties, least of all a woman, and yet whatmakes you look in awe at the 2 principal characters in the book is their very imperfection; their inability to probably fight their circumstances and yet their ability to be the best they can be.    Anthologies have been written through history about the \\"fairer sex\\", the \\"weaker gender\\", the \\"opressed lot\\" etc. Both literate and educated women all over the world have stood up to fight for their sisters, for the wrong and right causes, with the wrong and right means. Repetition of what women have to go through seems as pointless as meaningless. This book inspires at a very different level. It makes you look at reality head on, makes you lock eyes with the most brutal beast that can get you down, some call it fate, some call it circumstances, I call it my reflection in my mirror. You truly are your own worst enemy if you let that reflection determine your image rather than the other way around.    Laila and Mariam - the 2 principal characters in the book, didn't live, they merely existed, but somehow in all that they went through, their spirit shone with a radiance that can only be a gift of the Divine. Yes, they are characters from a work of fiction, but as I started to look around me, I realized I have the privilege of knowing a lot of women who may not suffer the physical adversities that Laila and Mariam did, but mentally they could have been reduced to a shell of a human being. Yet these women not only survived but have done so with pride, dignity, with their heads held high. We call them by different names, mothers, sisters, friends, aunts, grandmothers etc. They each had a cross to bear, and for some reason it was not a burden, rather a gift from Above.    Look around you, there are women whose faces remain hidden either behind make up or smiles, behind twinkling eyes or an infectious laugh... and if you looked really closely, you would find, they cry a silent tear when no one is looking, they sigh wistfully when no one is around, they wonder about their \\"what-ifs\\" in a moment of solitude, and yet when life takes over, they shine with the brilliance of a thousand splendid suns....

031606792X|1.0|I started reading this series after I heard a rave review on NPR during their \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" segment.  The middle-aged gentleman described Twilight with such enthusiasm that I couldn't resist temptation.  I bought the four-book set and settled in for a long weekend of reading.      Three days and 2400 pages later, I'd finished the four novels.  I adored Twilight, tried not to slap whiny Bella during New Moon, and mostly skimmed through Eclipse trying to get to something interesting.  Finally, I got to Breaking Dawn.  I have never been so let down by a book in my entire life.  I don't even need to go into all the ways that this book was horrible - the other reviewers have done that well.  But, here I go anyway:    Wedding - So, Bella's wedding to Edward was not what she wanted, but what she was willing to trade for sex and immortality.  The wedding itself was not her vision and in no way represented their unique love, but was instead a fantasy created fully by Alice's vision.      Honeymoon - Meyer is telling us that sex is scary and awful.  You will have a lot of pain your first time and your husband, who puts you up on a pedestal, will hate himself for \\"hurting\\" you, no matter how yummy delicious it is.  Oh, and once you do get some, it's pretty much the only thing you'll want, and your new hubby will reject you, mercilessly, due to his own hang ups.  Woo!  I gotta get me some of that!    Also, how come it's either a little french kissing or sex?  How come no one ever talks about alllll that space in between those two extremes?  What a perfect place for her to talk about sex and the implications of it, especially given her target audience.      Pregnancy - You will get pregnant the very first time you have sex.  Pregnancy is the most horrible state you will ever experience.  It will be stunningly painful as your body is taken over by something that hurts you, and tries to kill you, and eventually chews its way out of you.  The bloodbath of child birth is fine -but it says a lot, to me, about Meyer that she can't write the sex, but can write the gore.  Or maybe it's about society, and not Meyer at all.  Take your pick.    Renesmee - Say it out loud.  I dare you.  Look, I get what Meyer was trying to convey here about the beauty of having a child, the connection that a newborn's family feels to the child and how fleeting childhood is.  But come on!  The massive gaps in logic and leaps of faith it takes you to get here are stunning.  Stunning.  And impossible.    Jacob - Sigh.  Poor Jacob.  This boy never had an ounce of pride, he submitted it all to Bella, only to find himself a pedophile in the end.  How utterly freaking awful.  (and yeah, I tried to go with the whole \\"it's fiction, not pedophilia\\" but I just couldn't get there.  It was creepy.)    The Cullens - Who?  No seriously though, Edward had a family?  Where were they after page 150?    Renee and Charlie - So, while Renee has been the primary parent and the person that Bella is closest to for the entire series, suddenly she's just...absent.  Laaaame.  And suddenly Charlie is Bella's first concern, but we've been given absolutely nothing by way of character development to buy into this.  Again, I say: Come on!    Editing:  Look, I don't know who edited this book, but ZOMG! fire that person.  There were so many errors it was distracting.  Dialog tagging: use it.  Also, adverbs are not your friends.  If Bella \\"shyly\\" does one more thing, I'm going beat her with her own arm.  If you have to tell us that people are chuckling, giggling, that their eyes are \\"tightening\\" (wth does that even mean?) then you're failing at description.  If you must tell and not show, read some Willa Cather.  She gets away with it.  You don't.  So stop.    Tone:  I'm guessing that Meyer took a break from Twilight land to write \\"The Host\\" and that's why the entire tone of this novel is off.  It just doesn't even sound like it was written by the same person.      At the end of this novel, I wanted to rewrite the whole thing myself.  I wanted to see why Bella decided that she would marry Edward.  I wanted her to give a damn about the wedding and see some reverence in it.  I wanted to see a real deepening in her relationship with Alice.  I wanted Esme to be more than just a paper doll mother figure.  I wanted a real, honest to goodness sex scene that lived up to three freaking novels worth of some of the steamiest kisses ever.  I wanted Bella to pay a price for some of her choices.  I wanted that epic battle with the Volturi to actually happen.  I wanted someone to die.  Meyer cheated us out of the thoughtful endings that we get when good triumphs over evil.  That's what makes life sweet, and makes us appreciate what we have - working for it, sacrificing for it.      Bella would have actually wanted to marry Edward.  She would have cared about the decorations and Alice would have developed into a real sister, and not some overblown party planner.  There would have been real sex - not smutty, but real, nonetheless.  Pregnancy would have disappeared.  Bella would have had to make the choice - between having babies and having Edward.  She would have been cruel to be kind and given Jacob his freedom.  Jacob would have grown and gotten over her, and moved on and found real love with someone who loved him back - maybe even Leah, since that ground was laid pretty well.  Bella would have spent months being a newborn, filled with nothing but bloodlust.  Jessica would be her first victim.  The Cullens would have worked tirelessly to help her transform, and we could have gotten to know them all so much better.  Rosalie might have died, doing something selfless for once in her life.  That would have been doubly meaningful if Meyer rewrites the whole series from Edward's POV (ala Midnight Sun, which in rough draft form is head and shoulders better than Breaking Dawn.) Bella would have to give up Charlie and Renee for a while, but eventually they would be able to be in her life, altho in a much more limited way.  There are a million possibilities that could have had a very nice happy ending, with a bit of bitter thrown in with the sweet.      Meyer is a great storyteller and an okay writer.  If she gets a better editor and learns some discipline, she could be very good.  I found this particular book to be a total betrayal of the earlier books, which is why my review is so harsh.  Overall, I hope she keeps going, and I *really* hope she keeps going with Midnight Sun, which so far, I love.
B001TODCII|4.0|This review might seem a little contradictory to anyone who recently read my `Quantum of Solace' review.  These two films are virtually the same movie (not plot wise, but in the idea that they are all action, very little character development) and yet I'm giving this one an extra star.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, as anyone who has read my review of `Quantum of Solace' knows, I expected a lot more out of that film.  In fact, `Taken' delivers exactly what I expected it to, and in some areas even more; yet, while `Quantum of Solace' basically offers me the same thing it fails to live up to the hype spilling over from `Casino Royale'.<br /><br />`Taken' tells of a former spy Bryan Mills who has given up his former life in order to try and regain a relationship with his teenage daughter Kim.  His ex-wife Lenore makes that extremely difficult by constantly degrading him and purposefully keeping him out of reach of his little girl (well, not so little anymore).  When his daughter wishes to go to Paris with a girlfriend Bryan feels it is a mistake, but under immense pressure from Lenore he gives in and allows Kim to go only to regret the decision almost immediately when his daughter is kidnapped in order to be sold into prostitution.  Bryan then embarks on a mission of his own to track down and kill the men responsible for this crime and rescue his daughter.<br /><br />The film is brisk and exciting and always engaging; filled with one action scene after another.  While this is nothing special or extraordinary, it never lets one down.  The thing about `Taken' is that it actually delivers what it promises.  No one going into this is expecting a drawn out character study, and while they know that Bryan is worried about his daughter they are not expecting a father/daughter bonding film.  They are expecting things to blow up, people to get shot and their attention to be kept.<br /><br />`Taken' delivers on all fronts.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is a surprisingly adept action star (he should do more films like this one) and he carries this film from beginning to end.  He is intriguing, attractive and heroic; all the qualities needed to make a film like this work.<br /><br />In fact, `Taken' is so good at what it does that I was tempted to give it an A, if not for the last three minutes or so.  Yes, an action film that for once appeared virtually flawless falls to ridiculous pieces right before the final credits begin to roll.  I won't spoil the films ending for you here, but I will say that it is not what happens but how it happens that upset me.  The film had a real sense of gritty realism, even if the majority of the action sequences were highly implausible.  The thing is, the films handling of the emotional reaction to this type of tragedy was beyond ridiculous and almost insulting.<br /><br />Like I said, it's the last three minutes.  Until that point, the film works wonderfully.<br /><br />So, I highly recommend this one despite the ending.  It is one tightly woven action film that delivers the thrills it promises and then some.  Liam is perfectly cast (and I was iffy about that one going in) and Pierre Morel's direction is impeccable.d he carries this film from beginning to end.

B001W63DX2|5.0|Iron Maiden has seen so many changes since Steve Harris first started the band, that its nice to see the current line up perform the tracks I remember from childhood. Watching this takes me back to a time when I was 14-years old, listening to Powerslave on a Sony Walkman.<br />What impresses me about Maiden, is that they can set aside the egos and bs and record albums and tour the world. I used to like Van Halen but they can't get it together like this. Also, this is the first time a rock/metal band has had their very own jet to travel in. Sure, some bands have used private planes in the past but nothing on this grand of a scale.<br />This is a great addition to your Iron Maiden DVD library.<br />You get the documentary of just what it take to create a plane to carry tons of music equipment and props and still have room for the band and the entire crew. It takes a lot of people working together to keep a band like Maiden up and running.<br />What really impressed me about watching this was the fan reaction was the same regardless of the country. You see screaming Japanese fans, fans in Alaska, LA, and Brazil, and the focus is on the energy that Maiden creates night and night at every gig. Not many bands can captured an audience like that over and over again. Some bands may get it right for one show and then have a few bad shows later on, but not Iron Maiden because of their focus and desire to make sure the fans have a good time at all costs.<br />The first DVD contains the film and the second contains 16-songs from the first Iron Maiden album to Fear of the Dark. The 2nd DVD shows you concert highlights from all the countries on the tour minus the flight times and jet lag. The jet lag had to be severe and its amazing to see the band members put out that much energy every night.<br />If you an Iron Maiden fan or into Metal, then watch Flight 666 and see a band in top form. You won't be disappointed with this.
B001K61O6C|2.0|As I am a big fan of Marvin Gaye, it was difficult to give this recording only two stars, but 1st of all there was no warning on Amazon that this was a stereo only sacd, which I don't buy usually. That said, I have an SACD by the rock band Boston, which is recorded in stereo only and the sound quality is leaps and bounds better than the standard CD version.  This Marvin Gaye SACD, I compared to other recordigs I have of him on CD and I can detect little or no difference.  I was disappointed by this purchase.
1593080891|4.0|When commenting about the brilliant Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice is the most commonly discussed.  Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works.  Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer.  Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire.  Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived.  In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates.  Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society.  Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live.  This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance.  Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money.  It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority.  I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable.  I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma.  I would most certainly suggest it!
B0013ND36G|4.0|The Terminator idea is something of great intrigue to me and although it may seem extremely farfetched and even a bit bizarre that I would believe such a thing, I do actually think a machine uprising is a possibility. We as a race strive to create more advanced machines every day; machines that are capable of independent thought and maintenance are just around the corner. There is no denying that if we continue to create more and more intelligent machines and rely more on the interweaving network systems we currently have in place, there will come a point, in my eyes, not too far in the future that machines will realise humans are obsolete and realise that no longer need us around. I know it's weird, but it's the way I think. I also think Scientology isn't as bizarre as the media would have us believe. Let's make one thing clear, I'm not a Scientologist or a recluse nerd, I just think in weird ways.<br /><br />The original Terminator movie kicked off a truly brilliant series that lead to the triumphant sequel, subtitled Judgment Day. Nobody thought it could ever be topped and in many ways, with T3, they were right. It received quite critical reviews upon its original release and even had some people hating the very idea of making it a trilogy. Considering the age of Schwarzenegger, it was originally rumoured that he may not be able to be cast in this movie, and because of that rumour, the films production was condemned immediately. Luckily Arnie was able to participate in the movie, and actually got himself into shape and looking the way he did 10 years ago.<br /><br />T3 is set roughly 10 years after the events of Judgment Day and now another enemy of the future is sent back to assassinate the leader of the future resistance against the machines, John Connor. Not only is it John now in the firing line, but it's also the other members of the resistance, including Johns future wife, Katherine Brewster. The new enemy is the most advanced Terminator yet. Known as the T-X or Terminatrix, this female Terminator, played by Kristanna Loken is the most brutal machine to date. She can create any weapon from her arms and just appears more heartless than any machine could possibly be. John is once again protected by a new T-101 (Arnie) and is told that the Judgment Day he thought he stopped was merely postponed and is actually inevitable. Now with the help of the new T-101, Katherine & John must keep away from the T-X and try to find her father who is heading Skynet to try and find a new way of trying the prevent the Rise of the Machines.<br /><br />There is quite a bit that can be said negatively about this film, but there's also a bit of good to talk about as well. One of the biggest criticisms I have is the casting of Nick Stahl as John Connor. I don't mind Nick Stahl as an actor, but as the rebellious John Connor, he's simply not the right man for the job. I personally think Edward Furlong would have done a much better job had he reprised the role. I also felt that the absence of the Sarah Connor character was another big downfall for the third film as she's certainly a benchmark character for these movies, much like Arnold. Clare Danes as Katherine Brewster was just bland, I never found myself believing in the character and felt the film could survive without that character. I felt that she was simply a device to explain the plot of the Terminator history (or future, whichever way you see it) for the new viewers who may not have seen the original films. Kristanna Loken was triumphant as the T-X and for a female Terminator, I now can't think of anyone better for the role.<br /><br />A few things within the film didn't make sense to me, but I can't talk about them because it will ruin it for those who haven't seen it. One thing that bugged me about it, however, was the whole idea that Judgment Day was inevitable. If that is so, then what was the purpose of blowing up Cyberdyne Systems in T2 to prevent Judgment Day when it's actually just a way of postponing it? The CGI within, is really well done and the chase scene in which the T-X is driving a giant crane which destroys almost an entire town, is possibly the best action sequence in many years of film. The effects involving the Terminators is also very well done, apart from the hand to hand fight scene which had great potential, but just ended up looking like a big budget slapstick comedy sketch.<br /><br />The comedy moments are also a big downfall and dragged the mood of the film down to a ridiculous level. Thankfully, the doomsday mood was brought back through the immense action scenes and it managed to keep me entertained for the entire runtime. Flaws aside, it's a good addition to the series and although many loyal fans of the first two films may trash it, I enjoyed it and believe that those who have yet to see it should at least give it a chance.CGI within, is really well done and the chase scene in which the T-X is driving a giant crane which destroys almost an entire town, is possibly the best action sequence in many years of film.

0425200450|5.0|I picked up this book second-hand, and was it worth it. The version I have is an older version than I could find here, but same text. Either way, this book kept me reading until the end. Agatha Christie is definitely on my top five writers after that book.     The way the mystery is put together is extraordinary!  If you have read any other Christie, you might not be as surprised, but if it your first Christie novel, you will be blown away. The cast of suspects was a classic, but the ending was amazing. The last piece of the puzzle slapped me in the face like my alarm clock.    I liked this book because it kept me reading until the last page. Also the way the demise of that unlucky person, and how he died was pretty amazing. Lastly, the background on the murdered was based on a real event, not to mention the train they were on is real too.
B0020TS5LK|1.0|I bought the Trilogy Box Set (from Amazon.com), not realizing they were Canadian releases (only)..... and if you're familiar with Blu-Ray Releases... anything released in Canada (but not yet in the US), comes with absolutely NO Bonus Features (not even the ones contained on the regular DVD).  Audio options are limited & generally the best you get is 5.1 Dolby or DTS and so on.      If you want the specs on the Blade blu-rays (all 3), read my review of the Trilogy Box Set... as they're the same as those included in that set.   (below my 'name', click on \\"read my other reviews\\"... the Trilogy review be on the 1st page toward the top)    PS: Other Blu-Ray (Canadian only) releases you should know about (since Amazon doesn't tell you):  Seven (Se7en), Thirteen Ghosts, From Dusk 'Til Dawn, and others that escape me at the present time.  Some I'm not sure about; but am pretty sure are the same way:       At any rate, just be patient... a US release will come within a year.  Until then, Blade 1, 2 & 3, all look just fine through \\"HD/1080p Upscaling\\" (by viewing on upscaling dvd player, or on PS3, etc.).
B001JRB16U|1.0|Mary Poppins is one of my all-time favorites. Is fantastic film that is perfect in every way. the actors are excellent, the animation superb and the songs are unique. five years ago, Disney released a 40th Anniversary Edition DVD with 2 discs. It was one of the best DVDs editions that Disney had released with everything that we need to know about the movie besides the fantastic restoration of the film.<br /><br />This January, Disney released a 45th Anniversary Edition. While some people like me will think that was too soon for another re-release, Disney as usual, wants to gain more profits. This new DVD has the same picture and sound than the original. Nothing is shinier, crispier or anything. Is exactly the same. Disc one holds the same bonus material as the 40th Ann. Ed. Disc Two presents us Disney on Broadway, a bunch of featurettes that shows us the new Mary Poppins musical. This is completely a waste. We are concern about the movie itself not the musical so this is unnecessary. The other bonus materials are the same that the ones in the 40 Ann Ed. But, in order to put this Broadway featurerette, Disney dropped some good material about the movie that are encountered on the previous DVD. This material is: a game (not such a loss), the deconstruction of a scene featurette that was fun but most important of all, the Party where it shows the party after the preimiere of the film in 1964. What a shame that they dropped this extras to put things that have nothing to do with the film. So this is a very unnecessary DVD so my suggestion is don't buy it, and if you haven't bought Mary Poppins on DVD yet, buy the 40th Anniversary Edition which is still available and is the same price of this new Edition.
1439157383|4.0|I wanted to check this novel out before seeing the movie version starring Cameron Diaz, as well as being intrigued by the subject matter. Amazon's description and many other reviewers have described the plot, so I shall not repeat those descriptions here. I was impressed with Ms. Picoult's handling of the multiple points of view (complete with different type fonts for different characters--a lovely touch), and she certainly has mastered the tricky first-person present narration.<br /><br />As for the controversial surprise ending--while I thought it was awkward and unnecessary, I expect the author tossed it in because she didn't really know else how to resolve the impossible situation she created. So I'll give her a pass on it. On the other hand, I give her props for tackling the subject at all, and (as I gather from her acknowledgments) Ms. Picoult knows the subject she's written about first-hand.<br /><br />Regardless, Ms. Picoult's tale is a quality example of what a \\"popular\\" novel should be. It is meant to attract a large audience, entertain and inform that audience, and provide a satisfying read. In all of those things it succeeds admirably. To ask it to do more is to be unfair. Ms. Picoult isn't Jayne Anne Phillips (\\"Lark and Termite,\\" \\"Machine Dreams,\\" etc.), and I doubt she wants to be.
B001W63DXC|3.0|Iron Maiden has become one of those bands that releases a live CD after every tour and that's not a bad thing necessarily.  This live release is better than the last few live CD's as it has the best set list since the \\"Live After Death\\" album back in 1985, the reason being obvious:  Iron Maiden's best material is from the 1980's.<br /><br />Although the performances are competent, there is really nothing new on this live release.  Every track has been released on one live release or another over the years (Moonchild was part of the Eddie's Head Archives).  Still, this is a nice souvenir for anyone who attended the \\"Somewhere Back In Time\\" tour and an opportunity for those who didn't to hear the show.<br /><br />Peace
B001U0HBPG|2.0|Mix several parts \\"Titanic\\" with \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Jerk\\"; fold in elements of \\"Back to the Future\\" along with the atmosphere and diction from a Tennessee Williams play. Stir at length until mixture becomes stiff and heavy before baking for two hours and forty-six minutes, preferably while a CAT 5 hurricane is bearing down on you.<br /><br />I didn't recognize anything remotely reminiscent of F. Scott Fitzgerald in the result; but if this formula sounds appealing to you, you'll love \\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\\".
B001O8C5KK|4.0|In the DVD era it comes as quite a surprise that EMI is investing in a brand new CD set of Puccini's Madama Butterfly.  Especially Butterfly, an opera recorded umpteen times and favored by some of the greatest conductors most notably Karajan who probed the depths and unearthed so much beauty in this score much to the chagrin of its detractors who ridiculed it as shallow and sentimental.<br />Karajan definitely cannot be surpassed and Sinopoli's wonderfully detailed, sensuous reading comes as a close second.<br />However, being in the 21st century it is still important to hear new artists tackling the score and this handsomely presented new set with full libretto and demonstration sound does just that.  From the first bar onwards we are instantly aware of the excitement and electricity of Antonio Pappano's brilliant, empathetic conducting, turning the orchestra into a major dramatic role in an almost Wagnerian fashion. His feeling for detail is uncanny. For example just  feel how he creates an almost unbearable and horrifying near silence just before final tragedy.<br /><br />Jonas Kaufmann as Pinkerton is a strong `heldentenor', singing out the notes, but I am missing the Italianate charm that I am sure Puccini intended. In the supporting roles, Capitanucci (Sharpless) and Shkosa (Suzuki) are aimply not comparable to the unforgettable Christa Ludwig and Giuseppe de Luca and others.<br /><br />However, the second major factor that makes this recording so extraordinary is famed Puccini heroine Angela Gheorghiu in the title role.  It requires a singer-actress of the highest caliber to portray the development of a 15 year old geisha into a lover, a proud mother and later a tragic heroine. She accomplishes this daunting task beautifully with a memorable performance.<br /><br />For those interested, EMI created a 15 min. video showing the work that went into the making of the recording in Rome. I am sure it will convince you to acquire this set.This can be seen on YouTube and I found it very informative and entertaining.tive and entertaining.
B000063V8R|5.0|I have been wanting to buy Star Trek Next Generation for years.  it was so expensive at the begining, prices have come down and their was a sale on when I bought this.  I love science fiction and I love all things star trek. They said this is the best season, however if you like Star Trek, I would love to have all the season's!!!!! I don't believe your going to see tv shows like this in the future, because of production cost's. This is a classic show.  So enjoy!!! this is sure to please if you like science fiction. amazon's A1 service!!!
B00000IMTF|5.0|I cannot say a single bad thing about this album.  From the artwork to the songs themselves everything is perfect.  I don't feel the need to be verbose since many previous reviews did a wonderful job at breaking the album down into detail.  I will say this though:<br /><br />Stargazer is one of my FAVORITE songs of all time.  For me it is right up there in the top 10 alongside Freebird, Stairway to Heavan, etc. etc.  Crazy? Maybe...but IMHO it is the truth.  From the pounding drums and driving keyboards to the EPIC storytelling & vocals from Dio....I love this track.  When it comes on my ipod while I'm working (painting houses) or at my house I play it no less than 4 times in a row<br /><br />Tarot Woman 9/10<br />Run With the Wolf 9/10<br />Starstruck 8.5/10<br />Do you Close Your Eyes 8/10<br />Stargazer 20/10!!!!<br />Light in the Black 10/10!!!
B001EO2UKO|4.0|I've been a fan of Dido since her first album, and while Life for Rent is still my favorite, this one is right up there.  It's schmaltzy and emotional, her voice has the same great softly-haunting quality, and the lyrics are clever and get you knotted up and feeling slightly melancholy, but in a sort of enjoyable way.<br /><br />So yeah, I'm still a fan.  I can see where some people would say this was boring, but if you like Dido, you probably will like this.  I particularly connected with Grafton Street, which reminded me a lot of her older songs.
0307277887|4.0|THE DEXTER SERIES<br />&#34;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&#34; is the first in the Dexter series.  Dexter is a CSI (specifically, a blood-spatter analyst) for the Miami-Dade police department by day, while his &#34;dark passenger&#34; is a serial killer (but only of serious bad guys) by night.  He isn't really schizophrenic since he is perfectly aware of his dark side.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br />In &#34;Darkly Dreaming Dexter&#34;, Dexter begins with the mutilation murder of Father Donovan, a Priest who has been mutilation murdering small children in his care.  Lindsay uses such short action introductions in place of the loathsome &#34;introductory flashback&#34; (or -&#34;ahead&#34;) which has become standard in popular fiction.  As used by Lindsay, these serve the purpose, but are also an eloquent introduction to Dexter.<br /><br />The real story begins with the discovery of the bloodless dissected/disarticulated corpse of a prostitute, on a section of SW 8th Street (Calle Ocho) where Dexter's foster sister Debra is working vice, dressed as a prostitute.  Debra desperately wants out of the vice squad into the detective department.<br /><br />As the story develops, similarities between Dexter's methods and the killer's methods become more evident.  Moreover, Dexter has &#34;visions&#34; of what the killer is doing, and the killer seems to know what Dexter is doing.  Dexter begins to worry that he himself may be the killer, &#34;sleep killing&#34;.<br /><br />THE VERDICT<br />Dexter is an intriguing character. The plot is well paced, and captivating.<br /><br />&#62; Click on “Stoney” just below the product title to see my other reviews, or leave a comment to ask a question.

B0016Q6CQI|4.0|You really have to be a die-hard Buffy fan to appreciate these songs completely, otherwise I can't see why anyone would laud them, given their show/character specific references and purpose. Still, it was a great show, and the season that this episode was done in and the point where each character was at at that time make the songs that much more meaningful. You really have to understand the characters to appreciate these songs- but they are all great to me.
B001XJEKGC|5.0|Maybe it's my age and the music that formed me and my generation, but even if you didn't grow up during the time of the Blind Faith releases, you will still be amazed at the quality of this reunion. Steve Winwoods voice is still clear and strong, even pushing 60, and Clapton is, well, still getting better at 60 + !!!  His voice is also strong, and when most of the other bands still touring who are approaching 60 tend to limit the upper register of their original recordings, both Winwood and Clapton are still hitting the high notes with ease. I only wish I had seen this concert in person, but the video and audio quality are excellent, and if you have a decent home theater system, you too will be transported right into Madison Square Garden as an audience member. Awesome DVD... Cudos to Clapton and Winwood for finally reuniting and bringing back to life the incredible tunes of Blind Faith..
0802136834|5.0|I love to read, but I am one who has to really concentrate to take in books.  Something has to be very interesting for me not to be distracted.  I was suprised to find out this book was one that kept me interested no matter what was going on around me.  I am very happy I bought this.
159102594X|4.0|At first glance The Blade Itself is pretty old-school: it's book one of a trilogy entitled The First Law, it features an old wizard mentor character and a barbarian hero as well as an untried youth, a feisty young woman and an army of nasty barbarians on the march in the north, whilst a resurgent desert empire threatens our heroes' homeland - the Midderland Union - from the south. There's also the threat of a non-human species gathering its forces beyond the northern-most reach of humankind's lands (isn't there always?).    Yet Abercrombie invests these storylines with vigour and energy. None of our heroes are quite what they first appear to be and the author expertly deconstructs them throughout the book, revealing their true motivations when you last expect it. Abercrombie is also a dab hand are writing excellent battle scenes and swordfights. There is also a hint of otherwordly alieness in this book, such as the scenes set in the House of the Maker which are quite memorable. The only major complaint I had about the book is the lack of a map. Most fantasy novels with a map don't really need them, but with military campaigns getting underway it would be nice to tell exactly where Adua is in relation to the Northlands, and where both are in relation to Dagoska, for example. But this is a minor complaint at best.    By the end of the book the pace has been ramped up to a compelling level, as our heroes depart in different directions to face their various destinies and full-scale war seems about to erupt on all sides. The Blade Itself is a tremendously enjoyable novel and I count myself fortunate to have read it late enough in the day to only have a brief wait for the second book.    The Blade Itself (****) is published by Gollancz in the United Kingdom and Pyr in the USA.
0688014291|5.0|This book is really the cornerstone of so much of what people really do in management to be successful.

0765356147|5.0|This is the best trilogy I have come across in fantasy. It has the most well-thought out magical system of all the fantasy books I have read, which adds a much-needed sense of realism. It is that much easier to imagine these characters in your head so that you are laughing and crying with them. Many people I try to recommend books to can't get into fantasy because it is too unbelievable, but I have converted many a skeptic with the help of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy.
B001B1UO6W|3.0|i paid $10 for this dvd and shamelessley i only watched it once ive never seen the first chucky movie and i relyed on the reviews so i bought it and kinda regret it. But the extras are pretty tight so i gave it 3 stars
B001DTPZNY|5.0|First off, there is a lot of disagreement among the reviewers.  Please, if you're reading these reviews to make up your mine, read some of the other reviews as well to have a balance of opinion.<br /><br />In this movie, there is an immediate plunge into action, followed by an introduction to folklore and an object for Indy to retrieve.  After betrayal, capture, dealing with icky creatures and letting you know he doesn't like snakes, Indy fights a strong man who meets an unpleasant end and is involved in an exciting chase before the final confrontation when the main villain gets what's coming.  Some people think I'm revealing too much of this movie.  Others will realize that I've described not only this picture but the other movies in this series as well.  Indiana Jones is a formula series, and it meets the formula requirements very well.<br /><br />Okay, this is not the most original movie.  There are some scenes that made me think of \\"Temple of Doom\\", while others reminded me of \\"The Last Crusade\\".  But first, I think it is hard to have a completely original plot oriented action adventure, and second is it made you think of other Indiana Jones movies as opposed to making you think of James Bond for example (though there was an \\"On The Waterfront\\" moment).<br /><br />Personally, this was my second favorite of the series, just edging out Temple of Doom, with Raiders being my favorite.  This has everything you expect -- great sarcastic lines from Indy; effective character introductions by Spielberg (nobody does better at making you notice a key character), a lesson against greed.

B0026UV77C|4.0|I've doubted and criticized Placebo's output before, but their newest album is really impressive.  15 years into their career and they've somehow sidestepped becoming a caricature.  It has to do with 2 things: the production/mix of this album is flawless, and Placebo now have a new drummer after ousting the one they had for the last 10 years.  It was obviously time, because they've not sounded this inspired and rejuvenated in well, about 10 years.<br /><br />There's hardly a ballad on the album with songs like Kitty Litter, Ashtray Heart and Breathe Underwater pummeling the listener with a dose of hard edged pop.  The album's title track and longest song is quite a progressive journey though it's easy to hear motifs of older Placebo songs in it.  Of course the album's weakest song For What It's Worth is also the first single, so try not to judge based on that tune alone.  Bright Lights (an uplifting pop number) and Speak In Tongues are anthemic in nature, but are also more poignant due to Brian Molko's contemplative lyrics.<br /><br />There's even a couple things I've never heard them attempt, such as Brian's voice cracking slightly in the chorus of Happy You're Gone.  And whereas every previous album closed with a signature ballad, this album ends with the triumphant pop fanfare of Kings Of Medicine.<br /><br />Granted, Placebo have traded most of their gritty angst for a mainstream sound.  And Molko's voice is a bit cloying at times, with his somewhat limited range.  Their first few albums had a raw post-pop-punk aesthetic.  Then the \\"middle period\\" albums started bringing in darker electronic elements, a successful move that ultimately grew a little stale.  Now the band, bruised but sounding muscular and alive, is back with a new vibrant energy, making technicolor rock for all to enjoy.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Having read the book first, I was a little disappointed at how much had been left out of the film. Whole sub-plots about the gang in the basement and the paedophile ring that the vampires guardian belonged to. Having said that, taken in it's own right, this is a very different vampire movie. About as far from Twilight as you can get. Thank God! Although there is some gore and violence, a great deal is left to the imagination and the acting of the two leads in very good. Being dubbed into english does make it a little distracting, but all in all a very good, very different vampire movie. Definately up there with 30 Days of Night as my favourite from the past decade.
1400067936|5.0|Taleb is one of a kind and has ascended to becoming one of my very favorite thinker-writers.  This is partly because I've myself been interested in this subject matter (uncertainty, probability, risk, judgement, decision making, etc.) for more than two decades, but also because Taleb makes original and valuable contributions to the subject, and does it with an immensely entertaining writing style.<br /><br />The book is too wide ranging to summarize its content in a review, but perhaps the main lesson is that we humans are inherently prone to being irrational in various ways (usually without realizing it), particularly when it comes to adequately judging risks (and opportunities) and thereby making appropriate decisions in the face of uncertainty.  We're especially prone to underestimating how often outliers (\\"black swans\\") can occur and how severe their consequences can be (\\"blowing up\\" in the case of traders).  A corollary is that we often underestimate the role of luck (good and bad) in shaping outcomes, and instead overestimate the role of our decisions.  Though we can't eliminate our tendency toward irrationality, we can at least be aware of it, and thereby deploy some \\"tricks\\" to help control it or compensate for it.<br /><br />My thoughts on this book largely echo my review of Taleb's [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]], and both books are similar in content and style, though [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]] is perhaps a bit more flamboyant (in a good way).  To be more specific:<br /><br />- Taleb is confident and may sometimes seem condescending, but his erudition is undeniable, and a strong case can be made for his iconoclastic brilliance as well. In a book like this, perhaps the usual modesty and humility don't make sense.<br /><br />- He's dismissive of those he disagrees with (even Nobel prize winners), and could be accused of oversimplifying their positions, but his criticisms actually seem to have a lot of validity, and recent financial events seem to have significantly (and unfortunately) vindicated him.<br /><br />- He often circles around his points, but his refusal to get right to the point pushes you to think more deeply about the implications of his ideas, rather than just quickly saying \\"yes, that's obvious, so what?\\"<br /><br />- His frequent digressions make it harder for the reader to follow the thread of his narrative, but the digressions are fun and many are quite insightful. For an open-minded person with an intellectual inclination, this can be a very gripping book.<br /><br />- I do think the more technical discussions should have been more clear and precise.  I guess Taleb tried to \\"dumb down\\" the book to reach a broad audience.<br /><br />- Many of the ideas in the book aren't original to Taleb, but the way he's woven them together and presented them with flourish certainly is, resulting in the ideas having lasting impact on the reader.<br /><br />- His suggestions on investing aren't very specific, but this is a book about being fooled by randomness in general, not investing in particular.  And Taleb's general advice to arrange safeguards against financial disaster, and also get exposure to potentially huge opportunities, certainly seems sensible.<br /><br />As with [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]], the bottom line is that this book is truly unique in its ability to intellectually entertain while conveying some deep insight and wisdom. Few people in the world have the right intersection of ingredients to produce a book like this, so we should cherish the fact that the book exists. Even if you don't fully agree with him, Taleb is worth engaging with.  For readers who like this book and also have a strong interest in science, I also suggest [[ASIN:0691021007 Chance and Chaos]] by David Ruelle.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.

6305428050|5.0|This crowd-pleasing little comedy almost came out of nowhere in the late 80's. With a title which leaves nothing to the imagination, we get to see Elizabeth Shue back when she was playing \\"good girl\\" characters..and before she got an Oscar nod for \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\". As the 17-year old Chris--who has her \\"dream dinner date\\" blown to smithereens (she gets even for that later on) & resigns herself to a \\"dull\\" evening of babysitting--Shue is completely credible & likable here as a white suburban teenager thrust through circumstance into the dangers of big city Chicago (a favorite locale of John Hughes'), complete with subway gangs, car thieves, and narrow escapes.   Chris' friend Brenda calls desperately from the downtown bus terminal as she has run away from home, but is stranded. Thus begins a crazy  adventure as Chris must take her three charges with her--lovelorn Brad, Thor-idolizing Sara, and Brad's annoying friend Darryl--and weave in & out of each ludricous moment, while trying to get home before the parents do.   Fledgling director Chris Columbus guides the film deftly through a harrowing comedy maze. There is a subtlety here--particularly in the delicate \\"can-never-happen\\" romance between Chris & Brad--that Columbus achieves that makes his bigger success of \\"Home Alone\\" seem syrupy in comparison. One of the highlights--when the kids stumble into a blues bar while trying to escape the bad guys & have to sing the blues--could have easily been far-fetched. Instead, it's charmingly fun to watch. Slightly over 90 minutes long, it's amazing how many twists & turns happen in this movie.   This is a comedy which can be watched over & over again!
B0027P77CU|5.0|Let me start by saying I pretty much like everything Devin has done. I know the word genius gets thrown around alot, but for me he is as close as you can get. I bought this on pre-sale because they offered the first 300 copies sold would be autographed. How could I resist that? I have had this CD a little over two weeks already, so I have had time to let the songs sink in a bit. At first I thought that it was a little too jazzy for my taste, but since it was Devin I have given it several more listens and I will say it really is pretty damn great! Sure it is a little different than you might expect from him but there are plenty of \\"Devin\\" moments thrown in. If you like Devin, then I strongly advise you to pick up a copy. I personaly can't wait for the next one to come out. BRING IT ON!!!
141690977X|3.0|The title is sort of misleading - the book didn't give me any insights into the opposite sex I didn't already have. Married men don't want me, even though they may pretend to? Not exactly earth-shattering news.     I enjoyed the book anyway; the authors were funny and honest, making it an easy read. Just don't expect to learn anything new about relationships.
B00009W0U4|1.0|The first thing that annoyed me about this movie was the cinematography.  I understand they were trying to invoke a reaction in the audience, but I don't think motion sickness was it.  The camera rolls and rotates all over for extended periods of time in the beginning of the movie (which is actually the end since it was edited in reverse) and again when the scene transitions to the previous event in time.  The second was content.  This movie is Sick with a capital S.  The search for Monica Belucci's character's rapist ends with her ex bashing the head of a gay guy (the wrong one, mind you - the rapist, this guy's friend, stands there smiling) to a pulp with a fire extinguisher, and it's depicted as if it's something fantastic. SICK.  This all takes place in a gay \\"club\\" called \\"the rectum\\" in which they had to expose the audience to the sickest, nastiest behavior on the planet all while rolling the camera through three dimensions, and playing a repetitive sickening tune.  The rape scene is brutal and absolutely Sickening.  No woman should have to experience anything like this.  I have to ask why it was glorified in this movie (everything builds up to this moment instead of the other way around).  It doesn't end with the sexual assault, after raping her the rapist lays there remarking how fantastic he thought it was, and when she slowly retreats he kicks (you later find out she pregnant when this happens) her and punches her face repeatedly until she goes into a coma.  If you enjoy this kind of movie, you need to seek professional help, because you're a Sick person just like the people who made this film and the rapist.  The end (or beginning of their story) is tedious with over-acted meaningless chit-chat between Monica's character, her boyfriend, and her ex. Yawn.  SUMMARY: This movie has no redeeming factors. My advice is to avoid exposing your brain to this glorification of hate, brutality, sick behavior, and a segment of society that relishes everything evil anddesecrating.
0143038419|4.0|When I bought this I expected to read a good book, to maybe smile or laugh now and then.    What I didn't expect was to yearn for the same spiritual journey and understanding that Gilbert wrote about. She did an incredible job sharing her experiences, so that I was torn between feeling as though I was really there at the Ashram or desperately wishing I was.    More, I wanted to meet the people she met - that's how well-portrayed her characters were. I'll be first in line for her next book.

B001QWBM62|4.0|Although I have only used the The Zoom H4n Handy Portable Digital Recorder a few times, I like it a lot.  The main purpose for purchasing the device is to use it in the video production business to record audio at such things as press conferences, or keynote speakers, whom typically I get a feed from the sound support or simply place the recorder on the podium.  Having a continuous audio recording allows me as a photographer, to stop and start the video camera to obtain a variety of shots and angles  of the event without worry of interrupting the audio.  Later in post,I download the audio files via firewire of the sound bytes and then lay in the visuals captured with the video camera. Anyone working with a single camera can relate to the value of this technique.  The unit is small, lightweight and operates on 2 double AA batteries. The SD discs are rerecordable and with XLR inputs, I can connect it to a mixing console or a external mic, or set it on a podium using the built in stereo mic/s.  It will record in a variety of file settings although I prefer the 48K setting. It's inexpensive and very functional.
B0026IA0QS|4.0|This movie is in my top 10 of all time. It is a beautiful combination of horror, drama, brutality, humor, unforgettable imagery, and the absurd. The acting can be flat at times, but this masterpiece makes up for it in it's epic mind boggling journey. This movie contains my second most favorite movie murder. My first being the brutally stabbed and hung girl or first victim in Dario Argento's 'Susperia'. Filmed in mexico to my knowledge, sleazy under belly of the culture as well as morbid latin american catholicism are used beautifully as a back drop to this bizarre story of Fenix. Fenix was raised in his younger years in show business under a circus tent, by his turbulent parents. His mother is a dominant mother with extreme religion who worships a saint the catholic church refuses to recognize. This unconventional saint is that of a young girl, clad in girl school uniform, who's images and statues represent her with no arms. There is quite a story behind that. Fenix's father is the ring master of the circus and is the big and burly mexican alpha male. He is macho, he drinks and womanizes. All three, mother, father and son are performers in the show. In a way Fenix's real family, when his parents are lost in their dysfunctional dramas, are the circus clowns who seem to always be there to offer unconditional nurturing love. This part of the story ends in tragedy, but the story really begins years later as we find Fenix all grown up and in an insane asylum. I won't say more because I dare wouldn't want to spoil any of the weird and absurd surprises, except to expect alot of murder, bizarre tonal changes, humor, and even a little romance. The music score is remarkable. It sets the tone all the way. From sad accordion circus music to dramatic samba and horns the later which work perfectly during the most violent and serious parts of the film. If you like cinema that is a little more of the odd, you will love Santa Sangre.
0307266303|5.0|Got the CD from the public library. Have not been able to stop listening. Am going to plan a trip to the Copper Canyon now. The description of the canyons, the people and the climate are exactly what my grandmother always talked about. Peru is now lower on my bucket list.
B001FB4W0W|1.0|Why is everyone so easy when it comes to vampires. This show is just one step above Buffy. The vampires are the same boring effected quasi-evil, oh so mysterious, gothic rockstar strutting cliche B.S. vampires we've been seeing in pop culture for 20 years now. People said this show had something, that it was different and original. Well, maybe if you've been living in a bubble and haven't seen any vampire related film or TV since Bela Lugosi. The show is rubbish, the writing is horrible, the main vampire hero is just plain mopey and boring, and with the exception of maybe two cast members the acting is mediocre at best- Anna Paquin being the worst.  Save your money. I wasted mine, because I trusted the opinions of friends who I thought knew quality TV, and bought the entire season. There has been way better HBO shows than this. Can't believe this show is by the creator of Six Feet Under. Truly bloody disappointing.

B0013N4AT0|5.0|I am a huge fan of Opeth, and although every album they've ever released is a 5+ star album, there is just something really special about Still Life.      If you've never heard it before Still Life is a concept album about the narrator(whose name is never mentioned) and his love interest Melinda.  The narrator of the story has just returned home after spending several years in hiding, or banishment?, do to a questionable past.  The reason for his return is of course Melinda, however fate is definately not on their side.  Too keep from ruining the story I will only say that this is a very poetic, beautiful, and epic tale with many twists and turns leading to a climatic ending.      Still Life is not only amazing lyrically however, the music and singing heard here is really quite astonishing as well.  Like all Opeth albums there is an excellent mix of heavy death metal music with beautiful acoustic interludes with folk and progressive influences.  Mike's vocals are at his best here with a great combination of growls, screams and clean singing that can change on a dime.    My personal favorite tracks are \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godheads Lament\\", \\"Face of Melinda\\", and \\"Serenity Painted Death\\".  Simply brillant music all the way through.  Any fan of Opeth should definatlely have this album.  Anyone new to this band should approach it with patience and an open mind.  It may take a few listens to get into if you're not use to the more extreme side of metal but overall fans of any kind of music could get into this album if given a chance.
B000FA675C|1.0|All copies should be burned simply so this stunning example of hideous writing cannot be inflicted upon anyone else. The premise, characters, research and so-called writing are an insult to all who can read. If Mr. Brown was going to invent history he could at least have made his fiction entertaining. He's not even clever enough to manage that much.
0312383320|5.0|Janet Evanovich and her best pal, Plum, are astounding in their acumen and hilarious way of looking at life.  I'm definitely a fan as I love a good mystery.  If it has humor, quirkiness, mysterious happenings, and terrific characters, I'm in heaven.  I can think of no better way to enjoy my evenings than with Janet and Stephanie evoking a plethora of emotions.
B000BCE918|4.0|I love the Jurassic Park franchise, especially Jurassic Park and Lost World.  The content on these film are very good.  However, these movies lack sound design and quality.  I'm a Film and Video Production major, and so sound is a big deal to me.    For movies about dinos, you'd think that these movies would have outstanding sound, kinda like King Kong.  I understand that the technology was not as great as it is today, but come on.  Like I've read in many others reviews, when T-Rex walks...you should be able to feel it if your sub can handle it.    Now, I'm not writing this to say you shouldn't buy the movies for what they are, because they are great movies.  However, Jurassic Park 3 is the only film that has a DTS track, DTS-ES no less (6.1 channels).  That film sounds great.  JP 1 and 2 come with a Dolby Digital 5.1 track, but it is weak, almost no LFE (Low Frequency Effects) channel, which the sub is in charge of.  Thats the annoying part.    The sound is a bit of a set back, but the beauty of the two films almost cancels out that set back.  Take this for what its worth I guess.    Other than that, great box set.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Bach was an exceptional gift to humanity, full of details, delicacy, grace. Can be considered as an exaggeration, but I believe God wished Kremer to play Bach. Many others play Bach, and Kremer plays. It is an ultimate expression of perfection, can not be explained by earthly concepts.
067144901X|5.0|I purchased this book when my son was just a few months old but it did not seem to hold his attention.  Once he turned 7 months and began learning the verious differant animal noises this book quickly became one of his few favorites.  We read it every night before bedtime.  This is a must-have.
0812550757|3.0|but there are simply too many implausibilities in the storyline that serve no purpose other than to set up Card for a lot of philosophizing.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|The album marks a return to the classic pop sound that made a-ha one of the biggest acts in the world. The ten new songs carry echoes of the band's early signature hits: 'Take On Me', 'The Sun Always Shines On TV' and 'I've Been Losing You'.  If you like the first album Hunting High and Low and Mayor Earth Minor Sky, You will love this one!
B000007MVD|5.0|I can remember back to when you had to track down bootlegs of this exact material, and those CDs didn't have the announcer guy, whose spoken byplay with the Beatles adds a lot of reality and charm. Also, the booklet is rich in notes, details, data, etc. A great new--well, relatively new--way to get more Beatles than the albums they actually produced together in the studio. Very enjoyable stuff.

B001DF68MA|3.0|This item works as advertised, and the main reason why people give it good reviews is because having your child sit upfront indeed is a great way to have interactive rides with your child.  BUT, if there was any competition in this category from a major manufaturer (the iBert is equally poor quality), nobody would buy this product, let alone pay $80 for flimsy, poor plastic. The seat feels extremely cheaply made and the plastic is so thin that it stretches and moves easily when pushed. I can not imagine what would happen in an accident, better ride very very carefully! In addition, the belt system is extremly poorly designed. It has shoulder straps, but it is only a 3-point harness. We manually added an additional clasp at the chest, as a three point harness seemed quite unsafe for this application.  In summary, the items works as advertised but it is of very poor quality and way overpriced for what it is.
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris takes the littlest things and turns them into full stories with wit, humor (albeit a little dark - OK a lot dark!), sadness, and sometimes head-shaking ridiculousness! He says what we are thinking but would never say - with simplicity and reckless abandon. His story about racing an unsuspecting woman in the pool was laugh-out-loud funny. Sitting, reading a book, laughing out loud - that just doesn't happen, but it does with this book. You won't be sorry!

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|In-South-People?. (local mexico city joke).<br /><br />\\"Insurgentes\\" is: Insurrection People.<br /><br />Most of the pictures and video shuts were taken in Mexico City. Places like Xochimilco (where the dolls are hanging in the trees), Convento de las Monjas, and the Insurgentes Avenue (Avenida de los Insurgentes). This avenue is one of the longest streets in Mexico City, it runs from Indios Verdes (north side) up to Autopista a Cuernavaca (south side). Very long avenue. In a normal day it could take you more than 3 hours to go from one point to the other.<br /><br />Imagine a city of 70 mile radius with more than 23 million people living together!. Sounds crazy, right?. It is!. That's Mexico City. Also known as \\"el DF\\", or, \\"el DeFectuoso\\" (the defective City).<br /><br />Now, about \\"Insurgentes\\" music. It is great!. It is not Porcupine Tree. It is more ambient and sometimes kind of dark. It is Steven Wilson by its own and the \\"Insurgentes\\" track is very melancolic. Some parts of this album takes me back to PT music. I still like more PT that Steven Wilson alone. Maybe it needs more time to grow on me.<br /><br />My all-time favorite PT albums are (in that particular order):<br /><br />1. Voyage 34.<br />2. Up The Downstairs.<br />3. The Sky Moves Sideways.<br />4. Staircase Infinities.<br /><br />Note: I'm more into Tangerine Dream and Pink Floyd style of music. That is why I prefer the \\"old\\" Porcupine Tree music.<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Insurgentes\\" is a great album that you don't have to miss it.<br /><br />Saludos from \\"El DeFectuoso\\".

B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is an exciting and creative show based on the Sookie Stackhouse novels.  I am usually disappointed by movies/shows that are based on books because they can be so abbreviated due to time constraints.  However, True Blood- season one is twelve hours dedicated to the first book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.  Not only is it thorough, but it has it's own creative twists and turns so that it is not exactly like the book.  In this series, you learn alot about the supporting characters as well.  This is really a great show.
044024238X|4.0|[[ASIN:1439217041 My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss Her]]    Sophie Kinsella is funny and a talented writer. If the reader is looking for a light, breezy story, this would work.  I was a tiny bit put-off right at the start because the main character was keeping track of her weight, work hours etc. which reminded me too much of Bridget Jones'Diary. But this assessment was premature, because Kinsella's characters and plot line are unigue and entertaining. The reader should know that the story is completely unrealistic, which is fine, if that is what he or she is looking for.. Don't expect a page-turner plot to become engrossed in.  It is for pure entertainment.  If you know that from the get-go, just relax for the ride!  by Tracy Davis, author of MY HUSBAND RAN OFF WITH THE NANNY AND GOD DO I MISS HER

1423101472|5.0|Ah, this book was wonderful.  I loved the ending.  I loved that Percy wasn't what you had come to expect him to be... the big hero in the end.  There are just too many stories like that.  Yes it ended on a happy note, but not how you thought.    This is a wonderful set of books.  I look forward to reading more by Mr. Riordan
1568987846|1.0|I bought this book because of the rave reviews on Amazon.  I received it today only to find out that there are NO captions or descriptions associated with the pictures.  Had I known that, I would not have ordered it.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|This is an awesome movie and I recommend it to everyone. However, if you're planning to buy the Blu-Ray version, you better make sure you have a BRAND NEW Blu-Ray player.  It will NOT play on older players.  Those that are so old that they do not have the ability to upgrade the firmware will probably NEVER be able to play this movie. I guess it's some kind of copy protection crap, but I'm getting sick and tired of modern technology that doesn't work properly.  This movie deserves better.
0307341569|5.0|I loved this book.  Like the title implies, this is a dark story.  But it is also a well written and very engrossing story.   I really got drawn in by the mystery of who killed Libby Day's family.  I liked Libby, she made an interesting heroine, even though her past had left her bitter and depressed.  The book slowly unravels the mystery of what really happened by alternating Libby's story, her mother Patty's story, and her older brother, Ben's story.  This is a great book with great character development.  Give this book a try if you enjoy dark mysteries that delve deeply into the tragedy of a family, and the ramifications to those who survived.
0783240287|5.0|The musical,by Andrew Lloyd Webber and starring Donnie Osmond, is a wonderful and entertaining experience.  Osmond starred in the stage play over a thousand times and was the most popular star performing the Biblical figure of Joseph in Genesis 39.  Very much in the style of Jesus Christ Superstar, Joseph is a light hearted and uplifting show with a good feeling from start to finish.  Andrew Lloyd Webber employs a number of different musical idioms, and the performers are talented with the music well done.

1592332803|5.0|The Joy of Vegan Baking has the perfect title because it truly does bring JOY to anyone who eats one of the amazingly delicious recipes in this cookbook.     Both my vegan friends and my meat-eating family (who usually cannot even tell they are eating vegan cookies) constantly request treats from The Joy of Vegan Baking. My friends require me to bring Colleen's No-Bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie to every party we have. And the best part is that this recipe (and all her recipes) is so incredibly easy to make!! It probably takes 5 minutes!    And Colleen's helpful tips and knowledge about ingredients simplifies the whole process of baking. She provides a great index and useful resource pages. Whether I am looking to make an elegant dessert (the Lemon Cheesecake is stunning!) or a simple breakfast (my family requests the Currant Scones weekly), I can always find an easy-to-follow recipes in The Joy of Vegan Baking and it always turns out delicious. This cookbook is a great way to bring joy to those you love!
B00003CWN3|5.0|\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" tells the true tale of Brandon Teena, a girl suffering from sexual identification disorder: she was born an actual female, but desires to be a guy through sexual reassignment surgery. The plot follows Brandon as \\"he\\" enounters a lot of trailer trash-type individuals, and the story concludes with Brandon being raped by two men who he associated with who learned Brandon was actually a girl. These two men eventually murder Brandon. The film is harrowing, yet truthful and is one of those rare American movies that shows the hatred against those that are different or are perceived to be abnormal. The film broke during the time Matthew Sheppherd was murdered, and as a result many were curious to view \\"Boys Don't Cry\\". Hilary Swank desevedly received the Oscar in 1999 for Best Actress in a Motion picture. For those who enjoyed \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" NBC released \\"The Matthew Sheppherd Story\\", so if you happen to come across it on televison viewings I would suggest in watching it: it too is an excellent film about the hatred that gays can be faced with. That film has never been put on DVD yet.<br /> \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" was an independent film that found its way into the mainstream through word-of-mouth. It costs over two million to make but grossed over $11,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD comes with an excellent commentary by the director of the movie.
B000003C2U|5.0|I never make the claim that I am a positive person, in fact I never am. Describe a newborn baby mixed with newlyweds and a cured cancer patient and I'll only focus on how your fat and the world sucks. So it's normally difficult for me to verbate something I feel is 'good', here having the definition of 'not testicle-crushingly bad'. However, once in a while I find due reason to be positive, and the more I think about it, the more appropriate it seems.<br /><br />So I come to finally reviewing this album, an album I've had for years from a band I've loved just as long, and whom I've reviewed several other times for their (meaning Chuck's, as it was essentially his own band) other albums - incidentally, why don't you go read, comment, and give me more prominence at the conclusion of this review?<br /><br />I find it a little odd, Human was the first Death Album I bought, and the favorite one of the bunch. I guess I could go on describing the album, but I feel that people who disect albums in their reviews are akin to talkative buttholes who don't understand how a good review works.<br /><br />You see, it's not to tell you everything ABOUT the thing itself, but more of what the reviewer THINKS ABOUT the thing, leaving all the best details unsaid so as to not ruin the experience for the listener. If you want details, go read some idiots review. So I'm going to do that, not tell you a damn thing about this albums musical details and only shower it with love like a delusional teenage girl on Justin Bieber, minus the crappy pop music and oral sex miming.<br /><br />Well okay, if you want details, fine: It's fast-paced death metal with the right blend of complexity, speed, and not-so-guttural vocals. Enough?<br /><br />Alright, I'll tell you more while showering it with love...<br /><br />I love this album so much for various reasons: It's 34 minutes long and doesn't amble bout with it's time, every second is used and used well. The vocals are just deep enough without sounding like a low-end fart mixed with an idling monster truck (aka Cannibal Corpse). The lead guitar work effortlessly mixes the classically-trained learnedness of Masvidal with the \\"play-by-ear, free spirit\\" style of Schuldiner. The drumming is so terribly strong it sounds like the footsteps of an oversized army sprinting in perfect unison towards a village that pissed them off by looking at them funny. The bass is an interesting little addition because, unlike many metal bands (today, especially), it's THERE, and audible no less. The fact it is played by the only metal bassist to play a fretless AND found a chain of popular frozen pizza is simply a nice addition (Steve DiGorgio, of course).<br /><br />That paragraph was short on love, so let me do one more...<br /><br />I love Human so much because it is truly unlike any album I've ever heard, and I've heard more album then you have. I bought it while my friend was debating purchasing this or Morbid Angel's Altars of Madness but with the slight problem of only being able to afford one. So I bought Human for him, initially out of the kindess of my shrunken, unemotional heart. Of course, the selfish part of my heart later chose to keep the CD for itself - and by extension, me. The first playthrough had me thinking it was \\"interesting, okay, and weird\\". The second and third saw me starting to hum the melodies and rythms afterwards. And by the third or forth day of listening to it I realized how I was hooked to it like a ribless-man on an iron lung. So it grew on me, and not like the malignant ball of flesh that claimed the life of the band's founder (cruel joke, my apologies to his family - big fan).<br /><br />And this is why the album will astonish you. It grows on you. While at first it seems to be an album that is simply fast, you will begin to pick away at the layered guitars, the bass that does more then follow root notes, and the drumming which serves as an excellent beat to kill someone to. The lyrics also espouse an interesting view of humanity (a theme of the album, had you not guessed already) - as they are portrayed as selfish, incompetent, shallow, caulous, and all the emotions and thought processes that metalheads know and love.<br /><br />So maybe that may be the real reason why the album is attached to me like a child with abandonment issues: it reflects my view that people suck. I love the album because the album hates you (people, in general. Not you, MATT CASSLER - for anyone with that name reading)<br /><br />As a last joke before we are done here, I'd like to point out how the simple addition of the letter 'G' turns this into \\"Hugman\\", an idea seconded by the cover art depicting a skinless man seemingly gesturing to another skinless man for some company, or skin.<br /><br />-Erich \\"All sales are final, unless you are armed\\" Hall
B001TODCII|4.0|Taken is just what you would expect but with the addition of a skilled actor, which so many of these movies lack.  Is it a silly male fantasy?  Of course but if you can believe Jennifer Anniston is just a girl from the office who can't get a date, this is no more far fetched.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Excellent! Wonderful!  I am very pleased with this set. The most noticable is that the picture is so much clearer and much more detail can be seen. Especially during the dark performances. The other thing is that the mix is so much better. You can hear instuments that you couldn't hear before. This was most noticable with the Sly stone segment (my favorite.  The extras disc is amazing. Canned heat comes off very well. I watched it from 3pm to 12 yesterday. After all the footage then there was the mini documentaries and the bonus disc still to watch. Very interesting stuff about how they filmed this monster film. Wadleigh implied that not every song was shot, so now we know roughly how much exists. The extras shows most of the goodstuff. I have the bootlegs of lost footage so I know what they used and didn't. The coolest thing was There was stuff on the extras that I don't own or had never seen like Evil ways. Fantastic to see brand new stuff.   Anyway if you love this film this is the ultimate way to view it. Very happy. Can't wait for the audio box in Aug.
B00005AG7K|5.0|Beatles fan from way back. Seen all the Beatle movies except this one until I purchased it. It was a little shorter than expected, but I enjoyed it very much. Really takes me back. Thanks for asking me.
B0029F1R2E|5.0|To say the least these songs Go way over the line with some of the most ridiculous offensive lyrics ever, and it's extremely well done and the result is the most hilarious parody album I've ever listened to.    Not only are the lyrics completely hilarious and very accurately done parodies of 80's glam metal the musicianship is also very good which makes this album more than a one listen gimmic. Ralph Saenz is an amazing vocalist who has a very wide range and can do awesome david lee roth esque screams (listen to him in his van halen tribute bad the atomic punks, you literally couldn't tell the difference between him and dlr if you tried.) What really makes this album is how he sings these real over the line lyrics with such conviction. The rest of the band, particularly the guitarist who slings great riffs and amazing solos throughout the album are also very talented.    This album is some completely non-serious glam metal fun and its hilariously offensive and crude.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|I seen the movie with my church when it came out. As a christian this is a must see movie regardless what you may think of Mel Gibson.     The new rich sound you get with blu-ray made the sound of every whip Jesus received a blood curling event as well as when the nails are place in the hands and feet.    It made me get off the couch saying enough is enough more then once. This will show you what Jesus went through to set us free.    Not a movie to watch lightly.
0307408833|1.0|I am new to gluten free baking so I too purchased this book with high hopes. I read the book from cover to cover, went to the store and purchased all of the expensive ingredients and started baking a banana bread. It was a disaster! The bread passed the toothpick test. I followed the recipe exactly, waited longer than suggested to remove it from the pan and it was a TOTAL flop. It ended up a gooey mess on my counter. The ends which did manage to bake did not taste good. I agree that the Bob's Red Mill All Purpose mix is not the best. I do not want baked goods with a horrible after taste. I luckily stumbled upon Elanaspantry.com and pattycake.ca. They have some terrific recipes. Elana's pantry uses mostly almond flour and I have made terrific baked goods with no after taste. The only downside is for those on a budget, it could be costly, but those eating GF already know GF cooking and baking is not inexpensive. I was also excited for a red velvet cake recipe but it is not GF - like 1/3 of the recipes in the book. I would not recommend this book, sorry Babycakes.

B00006JL1Z|5.0|The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac has two CDs with so much of their best music for us to enjoy over and over again! Fleetwood Mac always sounded good despite what phase of their development they were in; and they enjoyed a large following that still loves their music to this day. The sound quality on these two CDs is excellent and I like that artwork. We also get a pretty good book of liner notes about the songs and more.<br /><br />The first CD starts with \\"Monday Morning;\\" this tune has Fleetwood Mac squarely in the spotlight--right where they belonged and still belong! They sing and play this well; and you never have to struggle to understand the words that they sing. \\"Dreams\\" features some great singing primarily by Stevie Nicks; she does this with panache and that's awesome. In addition, \\"You Make Loving Fun\\" was a big, big hit for Fleetwood Mac; this got a lot of radio airplay when it was first released and it still sounds every bit as good in our times. The guitars work well and the percussion enhances the music, too. \\"Go Your Own Way\\" also hit the airwaves big time; and just one listen will tell you why! This is one terrific number and again they really rock! \\"Rhiannon\\" is classic Fleetwood Mac; and I really like \\"Say You Love Me.\\" \\"Say You Love Me\\" has great percussion and they do this one up right!<br /><br />\\"Over My Head\\" has a somewhat smoother flavor to it after all that rocking; it really is another stand-out of this two CD set.

B00006AVRK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00006AVRK Jeeves & Wooster - The Complete Series]]  What a treat! Four seasons worth of delightful nonsense.   I watched it when it first aired in the 80's/90's in England.   It is just as entertaining 15+ years later in the USA.  Hugh Laurie was the perfect Bertie Wooster and Steven Fry,   the ideal gentlemen's gentleman.   I simply cannot watch Hugh Laurie in the present day role  of an eccentric doctor on TV! I know he is a good actor  but he is always Bertie Wooster for me.
B00002ND77|5.0|Denzel Washington did deserve an Oscar for his performance in \\"Training Day,\\" but he should have won it earlier in his career. \\"Malcolm X\\" truly showcases the man's greatest acting abilities. Here, he portrays a legendary figure known throughout the world as Malcolm X. The man is one of the most important and most interesting African Americans of the United States, and Washington \\"became\\" him in the film. He didn't just act as Malcolm X; he became the man whenever he was on screen. Just listen to the speeches that he gives in the film. Now that's almost scary, considering that he sounds almost like the real Malcolm X!<br /><br />But this isn't all about Washington, either. Spike Lee's direction, the beautiful shots of Mecca, the period sets and costumes, the memorable performances of Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo, and the tearjerker ending are just some of the reasons why this film should be watched. It's a classic film that will never die.
0385341008|5.0|This was a delightful book.  I loved the format of letters written between the characters .  The characters were so descriptive and allowed my imagination to bloom and get lost in time. Totally enjoyable read and quite different than anything I have ever read.  What a wonderful story and it must be continued with a sequel.  I hated to see it end and am hungering for more.  I just wish they had printed a receipe for the Potatoe Peel Pie !!!
B00005JKED|5.0|The premiere for this movie had to be postponed due to 9/11. That might have helped, as it did very well in the box office. But still, the horrors of 9/11 gave the film a near-total eclipse. But thanks to strong DVD sales later in the years, it finally gets the recognition it deserves. This is one of Denzel Washington's most memorable performances yet. I'd say his performance in \\"Malcolm X\\" is the finest, but here he gets 2nd place as a Los Angeles detective whose mind is more twisted than most. Ethan Hawke is the LAPD police officer who is being evaluated by Denzel; he gives a spectacular performance as well. It's a shame he didn't win an Oscar for it. The supporting cast (Eva Mendes, Tom Berenger, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, etc.) also do very well in the film. The portrayal of the infamous \\"South Central\\" may look a bit exaggerated, but it sure looks real to me.<br /><br />Grade: A

B000I5X80G|4.0|Live at the Fillmore East  being a live album by Neil and Crazy Horse from 1970 but it was not released until 2006. When it was released it was met with great reviews by the critics and Allmusic and Rolling Stone gave it 4 stars and I agree and I also give this album 4 stars. The sound quality is amazing and it sounds like one is transported back in time and being at the actual concert. 4/5.
B000066744|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The acting is wonderful but it's the music that drew me in.  A variety of Jazz and other types that truly find it's way to the heart along with the powerful story of the friendship between the two men; one a land person and the other never experienced land, born and raised on the cruise ship.  Not recommended for young children, some foul language but always fabulous music.  Great story!

B000FS9MV0|3.0|After waiting what seemed like forever for her new CD I was sadly disappointed. Never could I be disappointed with her fabulous singing talent, but I was with the choices of songs . She needs a new manager. Renee needs to record the songs that not only she excells at but the songs the public wants to hear....the older classics like on her first 2 CDs. Maybe with some of the songs on SKYLARK she wouldn't have to pay as much in royalties. Please stick with the great classics and the older standards!!!  If she did she could put out 3 CDs in 1 year instead of 3 in 7 years and sell a hell of a lot more!
1416972242|5.0|This series is amazing, I found it almost impossible to put it down.  I will re-read it for sure.  I was sad when I finished the last book.  I felt like I knew the characters on a personal real basis.  This series is so sexy and addicting.
1423113497|4.0|This is an interesting series of books based on the Greek myths.  I have trouble seeing why the reviewers think the books are so funny, though.  Mr. Riordan does a nice job and weaves an interesting tale.  I would recommend it for any youth, but I would suggest a basic mythology book first for familiarity with the characters.
0307341569|2.0|The main character describes herself as \\"deeply unlovable\\" right from the start...I disagree.  I didn't love her, I didn't hate her, I just did not really care either way, which made the book not very exciting for me.<br /><br />I'm not a genre type of reader; I just read what keeps my interest.  I don't necessarily have to love the characters either.  I can think of many examples where the main character is deeply, deeply flawed and sometimes downright spiteful, but will always have a something that keeps you there, wondering, interested... Charisma? Fortitude?  ...or perhaps as simple as the reader just not being able to look away from the wreckage?  It's that je ne sais quoi, and for me, this book and its main character(s) did not have it.<br /><br />The story centers around the violent murders of three members of the Day family (two young girls and their mother).  The survivors are Libby (the youngest daughter) and the oldest of the Day children, her brother, Ben (the alleged murderer).  It is narrated in the present day by Libby, a stagnant and aimless thirtysomething existing off of money garnered from her traumatic past and the insignificant things her kleptomania afford her.  It is also narrated in the past (the days leading up to and the day of the murders) by her brother, Ben, and her mother, Patty.  The plot zips from one narration to the next to slowly uncover what really happened that night.  The frequent breaks in narration made it an easy read; if one of the characters/subplots didn't grab your attention, at least you had a chance to possibly like the other two.<br /><br />Categorizing this book as a \\"thriller\\" is a bit of a misnomer:  the fast paced \\"thriller\\" action maybe takes up the last 40 pages of the book and I would ultimately categorize the book as more of a mystery than a thriller.  The rest of the book is more about character development and watching the hapless family repeatedly get knocked down.  I kept reading because I was curious to see how it all unfolded and hoped that the conclusion would be redeeming.  However, the \\"big reveal\\" was so convoluted and unnecessarily fictional that I had a sardonic chuckle over it.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is that it was, in fact, readable.  If the writing had been tedious and irritating I would have had to put the book down for good.  Gillian Flynn can write, no doubt, this just wasn't a story that I found particularly remarkable.ed and hoped that the conclusion would be redeeming.

B001FB4W0W|1.0|How could anyone possibly enjoy this mess of a series? It consists of a total jumble of a story, inhabited by characters you don't care about. The only reason I purchased it, with the doubts that I had, was because HBO had ordered a second season. The reason for that second season must be low producton costs, the recession must be hitting HBO.  Also if you have ever lived in the South, be prepared for a parade of offensive stereotypes. Someone should inform the producers of this \\"product\\" that people in the South do no walk around all day in bib overalls, and every cook in a restaurant is not either a troubled vietnam vet or an over the top gay black man.   Please do not waste 1 dollar of your hard earned money on this refuse, you could have my copy but it went into the trash.

I downloaded this book while surfing the web on my iPod Touch at Starbucks last week, even though I was half-way through a book-club book. Needless to say, the book-club book stayed half-read while I ripped through this gripping, sort of gross, sometimes hilarious adventure. Not sure how much longer Jack Reacher can keep making his luck last, but I'll sure miss him after he walks into the sunset for good.

B001KZIRL8|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. It reminded me a lot of Love Actually which was really well done. The story between Justin Long and Ginnifer Goodwin was the best. They have some great chemistry and their story is awesome. The others were entertaining too, but took back seat in my opinion. The story between Aniston and Affleck was the worst part of the movie, and did little for me. Still very great movie.
B000AP04OM|5.0|I can't say enough of the quality of this film.  The acting, music, directing...all genius.  It is timeless and a great family film.  Julie Andrews has a beautiful voice, as does Christopher Plummer.  I have read books on the real Von Trapp family, and certainly, Hollywood took some liberties, however, because it's such a wonderful film, we can forgive them!
1400063736|5.0|I loved the way this novel was written. It was almost like a collection of short stories like Olive Kitteridge. Each story is unique. The first one is about an Irish priest who is passionate and confused. And the second story is about a rich white woman who lost her son in Vietnam War. Then there are Mother & daughter prostitutes, and so on. They are all from different societies, and do not seem to have anything in common. But, soon you'll learn that they are all connected in a very interesting way. When you finished reading the last story, you'll start thinking back each character again.    His characters are all well developed. I especially loved Clair and Gloria. I don't know how a male writer get to know their feeling so well. This doesn't happen so often.    Colum McCann has a big heart. He cares every ordinary life who makes this great world.
0451457994|4.0|I recently heard the audio-book of Arthur C. Clarke's 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's a fascinating story about man's first encounter with alien intelligence, and seems relevant today where the creationism vs. evolution debate still rages. Clarke throws in his unique explanation of human intelligence. Almost 40 years ago, I saw the move and was completely lost. Then I read the book, and loved the fact that I finally understood the movie. After that, I revisited the movie, and loved it. I cannot say what I would have thought of this novel without having seen the movie first. If you are going to read the novel, plan to see the movie before and/or after. Arthur C. Clarke was actually supposed to write a screenplay, but found that he needed to write the novel in order to contribute to the screen play. And so viewing the movie is integral to the 2001 experience. While humans are not traveling in space as much as Clarke anticipated, I was amazed at how much the author anticipated the role of computers and technology in the future he envisioned back in the late 60's. This novel is a classic worth picking up. It does not have a dated feel to it. It's fun.
1603580557|4.0|We tend to think in terms of linear cause and effect chains (\\"if I do this, this will happen\\"), or expecting to know in advance what output will correspond to what input, and we put emphasis on immediate results (\\"I will do this if the direct results are beneficial\\") over long term consequences.  This straightforward guide to systems thinking shows the problems with considering the world to be easily manipulable.  The fact that rewarding a team for good performance, for example, increases their short term motivation to work hard, doesn't mean that increased rewards will increase performance.  What comes out of a system depends not only on what goes into it but also on the character of the system, its current state of resources and how they are affected by external and internal variables.<br /><br />Meadows first outlines several simple types of systems and shows how they tend to function.  She reminds that the model is not the same as the system, and that we can always expect systems to surprise us due to factors we cannot determine in advance - at the same time as she highlights several ubiquitous \\"systems traps\\" and how to overcome their pitfalls.  She indicates several useful strategies for working with and living in a world of systems.  This is not really a textbook for those who will need to perform systems analysis, but it is a helpful introduction to systems that goes well beyond some of the platitudes that abound in \\"self-help\\" style business and management books (e.g. \\"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\\" which is true enough but only gets you so far).  Well worth reading; a book that could and should change the way most of us look at and interact with the world.  For another book on about the same level that gives a systems approach to thinking about ourselves, see the exciting and excellent [[ASIN:0877736421 Tree of Knowledge]].

0446691437|5.0|I found this book very useful. Unlike most 'self-help' books it does not try to 'nurture' the inner 'damaged- artist', help you to search for your undiscovered talents or get you to start journaling, this is a bootcamp for Artists!<br />There are no excuses. This is it. The writer explains in direct language that there is always going to be resistance and the sooner we accept that fact we can arm ourselves and fight it like any other enemy that wants to attack us and prevent us from living the life we desire.<br />Steven fully understands the cunning skills that resistance can employ to keep us from being where we want to be and then clearly explains the reasons that it exists and how, by understanding it, we can fight it and become the artist that we crave to be.
0756405890|5.0|I'm usually reluctant to read authors that I am unfamiliar with, but after hearing this book mentioned in several different settings I decided I should get over myself and read it. So glad I did! It has all the things I love best in a novel: a well-developed world, interesting characters with depth to their personalities, a plot that keeps me turning the pages, fun and ingenious details, plus a unique perspective to keep it fresh. I am eagerly awaiting the next volume!!
B000E6EHGI|5.0|Whatever it is you chose to call the Grateful Dead:psychedlic,country-rock,jam band they did indeed become one of the biggest rock bands of the 70's. Even if that was sometimes just an larger than life cult following,mostly for their live shows they did make some of their greatest music during this period. The Dead spent the last albums [[ASIN:B000E1ZBEU Wake of the Flood]] and the excellent [[ASIN:B000E1ZBF4 From the Mars Hotel]] looking for new ways to integrate rhythms into their already well established psychedelic country-rock sound. On this album that concept turns the band onto a whole musical about face as rhythm becomes the central focus. The result is one of the finest jazz-funk recordings you will find in the \\"rock\\" section of your local record store.Simply speaking the first five songs are part of one long groove,even if they are seperated:on \\"Help On The Way\\",\\"Franklin's Tower\\" and especially the celebratory jam \\"The Music Never Stopped\\" you can hear Bill Krutzmann is drumming a lot funkier and Phil Lesh's bass let's up some heavy slaps and pops now and then. I don't think...being the sort of band they were the Dead probably hadn't really put the energy into thoroughly understanding funk-it's as deeply rooted a music as psychedelica and their experience was more at rural type sounds.But since a lot of the best funk of the 70's had strong rural roots the Dead made it part of their own sound AND made it work too.The final part of the album,the \\"title suite\\" as it were is a full blown return to the bands elongated psychedlic sound.Much as with the brief \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\" earler in the album Micky Hart gets a lot to do on the suite as a percussionist but not only that but in terms of the bleeding together of all the sounds typical of the genre even the sound of jazz and funk grooves enter the equation. The bonus tracks are made up of a series of more funky instrumentals.Stevie Wonder once said just because a record has a groove don't mean it's in the groove.And...maybe this music isn't as \\"in the groove\\" as it should be because of the Dead's lack of familiarity with this style but even still whatever they do with jazz/funk really sounds excellent to me so there's no use picking knits.No matter how you break it down this is one of the finest Grateful Dead experiences you'll have from their mid 70's output.And the fact that funk played a big part in it is very important.an it's in the groove.And...maybe this music isn't as \\"in the groove\\" as it should be because of the Dead's lack of familiarity with this style but even still whatever they do with jazz/funk really sounds excellent to me so there's no use picking knits.No matter how you break it down this is one of the finest Grateful Dead experiences you'll have from their mid 70's output.And the fact that funk played a big part in it is very important.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|Every situation comedy (sitcom) has to come up with a unique angle to view reality through, in the hopes of finding the humor in life.  In the past, this was generally done in family situations with \\"zany\\" characters.  That type of sitcom has also largely been done to death.  Even the \\"group of funny friends\\" situation is starting to be overdone.  Friends did it.  How I Met Your Mother is currently doing it (very well I might add), Seinfeld did it, etc.<br /><br />In \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" we are thrust into the lives of 3 genius level scientists, and one super-genius level scientist.  The story needed its \\"Spock\\" or \\"Mr. Data\\" to explain to the rest of us what on Earth they were talking about, so we got Kaley Cuoco playing the lay-person's character of \\"Penny.\\"  As the genius scientists have to explain to her what they are talking about, it clues the rest of us in too.<br /><br />The result of the situation this comedy is taking place in, is an inside look into a world most of us have never seen, nor do we understand.  As someone who took both levels of introductory physics (and passed!) in college, I can tell you that their subject matter is accurate, and also way over the undergraduate level.  The characters are pure genius, and pretty much every episode is hilarious and filled with heart.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show to anyone looking for a good sitcom to watch.  It isn't a \\"science show\\" -- no more than \\"Sports Night\\" was a \\"sports show.\\"  It is a comedy show, and it is darn funny!  The Big Bang Theory is now entering its third season, and I strongly recommend you all support it so we can keep this quality entertainment on the air!

B0009QZ4CE|5.0|After recording two albums in [[ASIN:B000000HTL H to He, Who Am the Only One]] and [[ASIN:B000000HTM Pawn Hearts]] that after being forgotten for many years were seemingly rediscovered in the late 1980s by the prototypes of the post-rock genre, Van der Graaf Generator, owing to numerous internal conflicts, were forced to disband. Peter Hammill, however, released four solo albums that featured, though on different tracks, every other member of the classic Van der Graaf lineup.<br /><br />It was only natural that Van der Graaf would reform in 1975 and when they did, they began work on new material, which eventually formed \\"Godbluff\\". In comparison to their two previous albums, \\"Godbluff\\" has never acquired the same reputation, and this no doubt prevented me from investigating it for some time. However, when I listened, it did not take me long to realise that \\"Godbluff\\" deserves every bit as good a reputation as Van der Graaf Generator's two previous masterpieces.<br /><br />It is true that Van der Graaf Generator do not achieve the hard rock sound without guitars they masterminded without emulation on \\"Pawn Hearts\\". The opening track, \\"The Undercover Man\\" in fact is largely dominated by the flute and Hugh Banton's newly melodic organ work - until Hammill sings with a growl that creates drama purely because the rest of the piece is as soft as it is. The next track, \\"Scorched Earth\\", is dominated by a groove-like saxophone/drum interplay that gives a hypnotic, but extremely emotional quality. At the same time, keyboardist Hugh Banton plays the organ with a tunefulness that could almost put [[ASIN:B000000132 John Tout]] to shame.<br /><br />\\"Arrow\\", the third track, is sparser but perhaps even more melodic, being more than nay other song the band had ever recorded a showcase for the dramatic vocals of Peter Hammill, which will no doubt scare some but create tremendous drama that fits the lyrics he writes perfectly. Whilst his lyrics are less obvious in their dark quality than those of Roger Wootton of [[ASIN:B0002VKPUM Comus]], they are more potent because of their greater overall depth. The final track of the original album, \\"The Sleepwalkers\\", continues this trend of nearly locked grooves over which Hammill sings incomprehensible laments of loss and dark violence. \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" is more nearly classic progressive music than the first three tracks and consists of numerous multi-part sections which feature a variety of texture more like earlier Van der Graaf than the first three songs - though still with more of the soft organ textures than before.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are live and of a quite different tone from those familiar with classic Van der Graaf sound because there is clearly no multitracking whatsoever. Both tracks feature the same recognisable players but Hammill's prominence is increased with acoustic guitars on the sad \\"A Louse Is Not a Home\\". These two songs will take some getting used to even for big Van der Graaf fans like myself, but they show another side of Hammill and the band that rarely receives much attention.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Godbluff\\" shows a probably more mature and wiser band still playing with all the passion, uniqueness and fire that made it into the pioneer band of the early 1970s.tton of [[ASIN:B0002VKPUM Comus]], they are more potent because of their greater overall depth.

But a serial killer with a sense of morality, killing people who have otherwise escaped justice.      He is a brilliant sociopath, a mix of the Lone rnager meets the Marquis de Sade, and yet thorughout you find yourslef wanting him to figure how he will deal with his secret and keep it hidden, while working through the problems he faces tracking killers and trying to be as normal as possible.    It is different from the show (I have watched the first season of the show on DVD, and it is also good), and the differences makes it worthwhile to read even if you have seen the show.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater.  I could not wait until it came out on DVD to rent. As soon I saw it again, I had to purchase it from Amazon to get the additional behind the scenes disk.  Wow! Amazon made it happen  for me.  All my friends want to borrow the two disks. Amazon, you rock!  Amazon has been my resource for other music albums and wireless headphones.

B00008NRI8|4.0|I loved this movie! Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are always great in romantic comedies and this film does not disappoint. The story is relevant and the movie is funny! THIS IS A GREAT FEELGOOD MOVIE!
0316096199|5.0|This book is amazing. The writing style is very unique and fresh. I found myself unable to put this book down. I do not recommend this book for anyone who has been through a recent trauma and has not yet taken the steps to get better. I wish I had access to this book sooner but this will help many survivors.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I ordered Season 2 of The OC on DVD and it came really quickly! It was exactly what I ordered and it was brand new! It was a great price! Thanks so much!
B00006FDCJ|4.0|I like westerns and I like this film but I admit this is a bit hard-edged. It took me a couple of viewings to appreciate it. It's a tough movie with a good cast and no nonsense. The characters in here aren't the talk-now-shoot-later variety. There are a few memorable and very tense scenes in this film, and a good share of profanity, too.    Watching the likes of Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman as the three main stars, however, is pretty entertaining. How often are those charismatic actors NOT entertaining?    Overall, a rough film but a pretty solid western which would have been probably better and accepted by the public better had the language been toned down.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I loved the movie and think it was directed very good and the actors were excellent but the ending was different and was not expected.It was a very good movie.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The writing for this movie was by far the best I have ever experienced for a Star Trek Movie.  Although, I have enjoyed all of Star Trek. Period.      Star Trek is notorious for changing timelines - Tasha - dead, alive, returned to earth per birth.  So come on.  Time is always relative.      Spock did everything he could to ensure he and Kirc became the friends they were meant to be.  McCoy's character was by far, in my opinion the best, too.    Anyway, the long/short.  We know the entire history now of Kirc, Spock and McCoy, but now we can relive it anew/fresh with the slate completely clean.  I think it was a great idea.  As old fans we can experience our favorite (I'm an old guy) characters all over again without saying - wait the Romulans didn't do that - well, now the writers are free to explore strange new worlds and new civilizations and boldly go where the crew has never gone before....    Can't wait for the next movie with the same actors.
0307266303|5.0|It is rare to find a book that does so much so fast.  The storytelling is terrific.  The information is worthy of a textbook.  The life-lessons should be engraved in stone and chanted from the mountains!!  I can't wait to read it again.
B002BPQ0Y2|1.0|I just can't give this album a higher review because of the excessive use of auto-tune. Is being able to really sing becoming obsolete, especially in hip-hop?
0307277453|5.0|A book well written with a lot of information. A passionate description of the relationships between us (our body) and all the life that came before us (fish, worms, flies, ..).<br />I wish \\"intelligent design\\" believers spend more time reading good books like this one instead of wasting their time studying legends from the bronze age (aka bible).
6304498969|5.0|This still ranks as one of Eric Clapton's best and most pleasant \\"concerts.\\"    I remember seeing this when it was first televised on TV. Later, it was a pleasure to get it on DVD after watching it on tape for several years. The concert always is enjoyable to watch and listen to, no matter many times I view it.    This is a nice mellow-sounding concert and most of the songs grow on you. It's presented in such a classy form that it provides something different: blues/rock 'n roll in a quieter format. This was so successful that other performers copied it with their \\"unplugged\\" concerts.    There are many familiar faces with Clapton here and I particularly enjoyed Chuck Leavell on keyboard. On \\"Old Love,\\" he gives one of the better piano solos I've ever heard. Leavell is best-known as the keyboard man for the Rolling Stones. Meanwhile, percussionist Ray Cooper is the most fun guy to watch. It's doubtful a drummer ever had as much fun as he does in concerts, especially when he's showing off with the tambourine.    All the band members from Clapton on down look like nice guys who are thoroughly enjoying themselves in this concert.....and it shows in the music.

1416550534|4.0|Kate Morton captured my imagination as I left my current world for the \\"Upstairs-Downstairs\\" world in England.  The descriptions, characters and action worked beautifully together.  I kept wondering what would happen on the next page, right to the very end.  I especially enjoyed seeing the traditions of the past brought to life again through Grace's eyes.    If you enjoy the early days of the 20th Century in Britain, this book is sure to please!  It was beautifully written.
B00008WT5M|5.0|OH My God !!! I thought I would never get here. I just can't believe that Anyone has Any use for the imitations that you gotta wade through to get to the REAL band. I wanna vomit it makes me so sick to listen to cheap substitutes to this legacy of rock. I don't have anything against these people personally but STOP IT! Only people from a later generation would consider these bands at all and bottom line the tribute bands just don't have the meaty depth of the original AC/DC !!!!
0316067601|5.0|very good nothing more to say If you reading the review then you must be somewhat interseted get the book You  will not be disapointed.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|This was not what I had expected. It was interesting, but it took me a while to grasp the thrust of the story. The opening scenes where the 'hero' was being interrogated did not, at least to me, make sense at first. Also, the transition from scene to scene was not done smoothly, I thought. I don't think I would have bought this if I had done a little research ahead of time.
B001VPJYZK|1.0|In the wake of \\"Reality TV,\\" and the abundance of shows with that premise behind it's name, Desperate Housewives was the most refreshing program to hit television when it surfaced in 2004. When the fourth season concluded with having life on Wisteria Lane jump to five years, I thought the creativity was sincere and looked forward to the continued intrigue that lied ahead. But no such luck. Let me put it to you this way, the producers would have been so smart to have ended the series that way given what they offered in season five. Let me put it to you another way, I stopped watching the show regularly by November after the fire in the nightclub( you know, where Dave runs back into the burning building to save Mike and then runs back out free of harm and not even the most insightful characters have a clue as to his evil nature). Let me put it to you this way--nobody wanted to see Susan five years ahead still failing at romances, acting stupid within her self-assessment of romances while there's a younger man so smitten with her instead of someone his own age. Why not have Susan catch a clue about Dave and investigate him instead of the old lady and her sister(what a waste for poor Lily Tomlin)whom we never knew she had until now. In hearing about what took place at the season's end, are we really supposed to believe that Bree would consider Carl given her high moral standards and values against getting involved with an ex-husband of a close friend? And Mike and Katherine as a couple? Never bought it for a second. And the whole story with Lynette and her teenage son sleeping with his best friend's mother and then the drama that followed? Hated it. Let me put it to you another way--enough said!
0393327345|3.0|Between the movie and the book the stories are pretty much the same with a few details changed and other things put into different spots. I have to say that I liked the movie more. I think the story lends itself to a visual medium much more and Pitt and Norton were awesome. They brought life into the characters that the Palahniuk was unable to do. The written characters were a bit flat and I wonder if the book was not written for the express reason of creating a movie. It reminded me of reading Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because of the overuse of dialog, over the top story and the lack of real character development. HHGG was originally written as a BBC radio show.     The story did hit my pissy yuppy, post-modern/hyper-modern anger at the world and for that I praise the book as a good social commentary. It did a great job of channeling the anger and frustration that so many people, including myself feel or felt, but the book never really gave any direction, even though there were continuous references to how a gun focuses the explostion to create movement in the bullet (this I take as an analogy of how to get people moving and change the world). Mostly in was yuppy whining with no real action or point, which ironically is exactly what and who most men are in our world today. It is in this way the book points out the plight of modern men by being a perfect example of the issue.     Overall, I don't think this book gave anything new to the world, just a rehash of stories we all hear and see. It is for this reason that I agree to some reviewers that this book will be a relic of an age gone by, a symbol of the frustrations of '90s, along with Nirvana and the DotCom boom.
B0020MKTOS|4.0|Correction!  There are closed captions, they are in the language section as subtitles in English for the hearing impaired.  Now I want to change my rating from 4 to 5 stars (but the web page won't let me edit that).    (original review)  I lose some of the subtlety of this film that I heard in the theater because there were no closed captions.  This is a really great movie though!  I am curious if the wide screen version has closed captions.
B001KVZ6FM|5.0|I honestly can't think of anything wrong with the new Pixar film \\"Up\\" co-written and co-directed by Pete Docter (\\"Monsters, Inc.\\") and Bob Peterson (co-writer on \\"Ratatouille\\" and various other jobs on many Pixar films).<br /><br />Really, the only discussion that occurs after watching this new film is \\"Where does \\"Up\\" fall on your list of Pixar films? Is it the best?\\" I'm not sure it's the best, but it is a superb piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />Carl Fredrickson (voiced by Ed Asner) is a lonely old man, a widower, who still lives in the tiny brightly colored clapboard house he and his wife spent their marriage in. Now that he no longer has his wife and best friend with him, he spends his days thinking about the past and watching his neighborhood become a very different place. A huge development is growing around him and Carl is being pressured to sell his house to the developer. One afternoon, Russell (Jordan Nagai), a chubby Wilderness Explorer, rings his bell and wants to help Carl with something, anything, to achieve his Senior Assistance badge, the last badge he needs to become a Senior Wilderness Explorer. But Carl is grumpy and doesn't need anything and only wants to be left alone. One morning, Carl reveals he has tied thousands of helium balloons to his house and rigged a navigation system and sets off to find the fabled Paradise Falls in South America, a place he and his wife always wanted to visit. After he takes off, and begins to enjoy the solitude, there is a knock at the door. Russell has returned and unwittingly become a guest for the journey. When they eventually make it to South America, they meet Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl's boyhood idol, and a disgraced adventurer who is still searching for a rare breed of bird, a bird that looks like a cross between a pelican and a dodo bird. Carl and Russell inadvertently befriend the bird and a dog-named Dug (Bob Peterson) wearing a collar provided by Muntz, which allows him to speak.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is a perfect film. The characters are interesting, funny, believable and human. The story is touching, brilliant, funny and human. It isn't often a film can make you cry one moment and then burst out with a guffaw of laughter the next. Many live action films have difficulty creating genuine emotions like this. When you are watching an animated film that manages to accomplish this, you realize you are experiencing something special.<br /><br />We first meet Carl as a young boy as he watches a newsreel about his hero, Muntz. On his way home, he walks past an abandoned old house and finds a tomboy, Ellie playing inside. Ellie is everything Carl isn't and they become friends. In a brief, silent montage, we watch many of the key moments in their life, including the moment they decide to start saving their loose change to buy tickets to visit Paradise Falls, a place they both fell in love with because of Muntz's adventures there. But like most married couples, there are setbacks, bills to pay. This sequence is so true to life, so sweet and so moving that it catches us off guard and manages to create some really emotionally jarring moments for us. This may seem strange for an animated film, but Pixar doesn't just create animated films. They are always going for something else, something more interesting and more memorable. I have said before that even \\"just OK\\" Pixar films are heads and shoulders above most other studio fare and most animated films can't even come close to achieving the same level of skill and storytelling. Pixar is the king of animation and if the studios don't watch out, they just may become the King. Period.<br /><br />As a lonely old widower, Carl (voiced by Ed Asner, the star of \\"Lou Grant\\" and \\"Mary Tyler Moore\\") does what you might expect a lonely old man to do. He goes about his routine and sits a lot, remembering the past. He and Ellie clearly loved one another and he still clearly cherishes the mementos of their life together. Particularly touching is a handmade badge he has worn ever since Ellie gave it to them when they were kids.<br /><br />When Russell shows up on his doorstep, Carl's first instinct is to rudely brush him off. But Russell is determined to get his last badge, and ultimately his promotion, and won't take no for an answer, shoving his foot in the door like a salesman. Returning a few days later, Russell unwittingly becomes a guest along for the journey. As they make their way south, Russell and Carl learn more about each other. Carl, grumpy and surly as he is, finds he needs to help the young Wilderness Explorer. But does Russell end up helping Carl?<br /><br />This is not the funniest Pixar film ever, but it achieves a more interesting balance of emotions. It isn't often that you find yourself crying during an emotional scene and a few minutes later, laughing your head off. Between these two extremes of emotion, we spend a lot of time with Russell and Carl and watch as their relationship grows and expands. All of this makes them distinctly believable, distinctly human. And they are animated characters.<br /><br />Russell is a persistent kid, a self-effacing kid, who likes to talk. As he talks, he reveals a lot about his life. Carl is an introspective old man, a lonely old man and a man of few words. Basically, they are complete opposites. But because Carl is quiet, he listens, and as he and Russell journey to South America, he learns a lot about the Wilderness Explorer. Even more interesting than what we learn about the young boy is how we realize Carl has learned something. Carl makes a small gesture, or his eyes widen. These are very subtle moments, but they work because they make Carl seem so lifelike.<br /><br />When they arrive in South America, they find Dug (Bob Peterson), a dog that has been trained by Muntz to help him find the fabled birdlike creature he has been hunting for. Muntz has, in fact, trained many dogs, and supplied them with special collars allowing them to speak. Dug is a bit of a loser compared to the other dogs, a dumb but very affectionate dog, he has been cast off on a mission of his own by the other dogs in his pack. They are much more daring and pack-oriented. Dug is more of a house pet. They can't stand him and know they would be better off without him. Interestingly, this is exactly the same ploy Carl uses early in the film to get rid of Russell.<br /><br />As they move along, dragging Carl's floating house to his prized position near Paradise Falls, Dug excitedly joins them, eager for the companionship and the attention.<br /><br />He also wants to be close to them because one of the birds has already become friends with Russell. But Dug doesn't really present a threat to the bird and they continue on their merry way.<br /><br />Until Carl and his crew come across Muntz (Plummer). Muntz has spent the last half-century searching through South America for the bird. He stores his huge airship in a cave and lives very much like Captain Nemo. Initially, Carl is thrilled to meet his childhood idol, but when he realizes he wants to capture the bird they have befriended, his feelings change and he tries to protect his new feathered friend.<br /><br />Muntz, who has spent so many years searching for the bird, clearly doesn't want to let the bird go and will do anything in his power to capture the bird. But Carl, Russell and Dug have some tricks up their sleeve to throw a few roadblocks in his path. Plummer does a great job of giving Muntz just the right amount of menace, respectability and loopiness.<br /><br />The addition of the trained dogs is brilliant. Dug and the others add a lot of fun to the story and the opportunity for some brilliant visual puns.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" is a brilliant animated effort, often achieving the same level of storytelling and skill many live action filmmakers can only dream of.<br /><br />As usual, there is a new Pixar animated short before the film. \\"Partly Cloudy\\" is especially charming and reminds me of some of the classic animated cartoons Disney made in the 40s.

B000002HO3|5.0|I had seen SIMPLY RED on a live TV performance and didn't realize that Mick Hucknee was the artist who sang all those wonderful songs.  At 63 I've never been much of music fan...but I saw an album cover of him in a side profile of his early years; he has the most beautiful red hair - it was pulled back in dreadlocks halfway down his back - G E O R G E O U S!    Looks aside, if you love jazz, you will absolutely wear this CD out playing it.  He has so much soul, his voice is beautiful and unusual and pure...I can't say enough good things about the man.  Enjoy!

My wife laughed at me when it arrived in a box sized for a \\"normal\\" book.   This is a great (and quick) book to read if you are starting to take control of your money and want to understand some of the philosophy behind building wealth. If you are looking for more specific, how-to information, I would recommend Dave Ramsey.

B001BKCWOU|1.0|This book could be about 25% the length that it is, one of the most overhyped books out there. Guns, germs and steel is one aspect of the results that have been produced,honestly it is a little simple-minded and/or an overenthusiastic but unobservant author. It seems like he has got a very interesting perspective but fails to really go in depth, starts with a bang then tapers of quickly.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this 2006 concert live and very close to the stage.  I will never forget it.  Barbra seemed much more at ease at this concert than her prior concert in 2000 and it was a pleasure to see her enjoy herself.<br /><br />Barbra sang a lot of different material in this concert.  And I truly think that what was said in the liner notes was true and that she only sang songs she loved, with the exception of \\"Stoney End,\\" which she sang in a staged question and answer session and the place practically exploded, to which she said she still doesn't understand the fascination with \\"Stoney End.\\"<br /><br />There were many songs in this concert that she had not sung since her very early career, some she hadn't sung since the Funny Girl days and some new songs that she included which are always a treat for any tride and true fan.<br /><br />Her banter with Il Divo was fun and the way she weaved them into some of her songs was well choreographed.  Il Divo themselves put on a great performance and it was a nice ying to Barbra's yang.<br /><br />This DVD set captures this concert very well and the additional footage that was included was much appreciated.  Barbra did not sing all of these songs at the concert I saw, so I was very happy to see her sing \\"When the Sun Come Out,\\" and was astonished that she sang \\"Nobody's Heart,\\" a song she hasn't performed in well over 40 years which sounded pretty much the same in terms of vocal quality.<br /><br />The additional footage included on this DVD set was previously available, however, it's nice to have it on this collection as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this DVD for old and new Streisand fans alike, it's a great view into a fantastic artist and what could possibly be her last concert of this scale.  Who knows, maybe she'll take over for Bette and Cher in Vegas (one could only hope ;>)

B000WPJTEQ|3.0|Follow-up tp to the smash hit that was the superior, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula(1992)\\", this was one of the most highly anticipated films of the mid 90s.  Francis Ford Coppola was originally supposed to be the director, but was exhausted after his work on the Dracula film, so the reigns were given over to Shakespeare helmer, Kenneth Branagh. The drama built as major stars became attached to the project, notably Robert Deniro in the role of the Monster, easily the most high profile actor attached since Boris Karloff to the role.  Branagh would play Frankenstein and this adaption would actually adapt the novel \\"for the first time\\".(Not true. There was already a far more superior and faithful version in \\"Terror of Frankenstein(1976)\\").    The film was released in November of 1994 to severely lukewarm reactions from audiences and critics.  The reason was easy to define but the film was also a fascinating disaster nonetheless.    Frankenstein had always been a favorite story of mine and nearly every adaption of the novel was sought out by myself since childhood. Most versions followed the outline set by the James Whale film of 1931.  This version was a major studio production with a big cast and director at the helm. It made the result that much more unsatisfying.    The film begins like in the novel in the arctic with Captain Robert Walton(Aidan Quinn) encountering Victor Frankenstein(Kenneth Branagh) in the ice. Frankenstein tells Walton his story, but there's no connection and virtually no purpose. Like much in thsi film, it's rushed. There's not much going on here and unlike other versions, this narrative structure is all but ignored for the remainder of the picture, dilluting it's impact.    Victor recalls his childhood in Geneva and what made him become so obsessed with creating life. This segment of the film is good and it's fascinating to understand what makes the famous doctor tick. Frankenstein travels to Ignolstadt when he comes of age and has a hard time at the University where he is studying and is largely misunderstood even by pseudo-comic relief of new found best friend, Henry Cleveral(Tom Hulce). By the way this is one of major detractions from the novel as Henry had been friends with Victor since childhood in the novel. Victor meets up with Doctor Waldman(John Cleese, wonderful and against type) as a Professor who had shared the same kind of fanaticism that Victor does when he was younger. He tells Victor to not continue with his experiments, but is offed by a beggar(Robert De Niro) and this forms the catalyst for Victor to begin work on his Monster. He steals Waldman' brain(like in \\"Curse of Frankenstein(1957)\\") and steals the beggar's body among other body parts. His laboratory is where it was in the novel, in his apartment, but I doubt Shelly imagined Victor designing a machine that resembles a metallic phallus complete with a set of balls! There's even veins painted on! The creation scene tries to be over the top, but still can't come close to the one in \\"Bride of Frankenstein(1935)\\". Probally because that one didn't need such blatant sexual imagery. Before long, Branagh is shirtless and wet on top of a copper vat shouting \\"live! live! LIIIVVVVEEEE!!!!!\\" like some High School Cheerleader.    His Monster comes to life and wrestles with Victor for a little bit(somewhat hilariously) and ends up being caugt on some chains and being cinked on the head. Victor thinks he's dead but we know better. So when Victor goes to sleep, the Monster awakens him and chases him and the hilarity has officially begun.    No one could ever forget the introduction of Karloff's Monster in the 1931 film, walking into a room with his back turned and revealing that iconic face with each successive close up. Or even Christopher Lee's scarred visage after ripping off his bandages on his face in \\"Curse of Frankenstein(1957)\\". In Branagh's film we get a quick medium shot and that's it of Deniro's Monster.  And it's a lame make up folks. Not too unearthly and rather plain, the make up was bets described by one critic and I quote, as a \\"Post Blood bath Travis Bickle meets a baseball\\".    Deniro's Monster roams the streets the next day and is found and is blamed by the town for the current Cholera epidemic. He fights them off with moves that he must have \\"remmebered\\" from a Pro-Wrestler and escapes into the forest. In every other version, the Monster is depicted as being a huge giant. Branagh was afraid of \\"size jokes\\"(oh NOW he's concerned!) and kept Deniro as a pretty small guy. Too bad it's utterly unbelievable to see the small guy tossing people about like ragdolls.    Branagh is nursed back to health by Henry and his fiance, Elizabeth(Helen Bonham Carter), a character who's independance is more 1990s than 1790s and dosen't gel with the film. Neither does her romance with Branagh, who both have zero chemistry. She's pretty in this, but that's by default.    Deniro ends up at a cottage of poor folks like in the novel, except things have changed once again. There's no foreign babe being taught english by her Husband and his father like in the novel, just some dude's wife teaching her kids english. No babe, just kids. So the Monster learns to speak and discovers some books(including Victor's journal in his jacket since he stole the jacket from the library before) and becomes intellectual. Some what. He helps the family getting vegtables from there frozen garden and gets them firewood, too. He eventually introduces himself to the blind father of the family and it's typically, like in most versions, a highlight. However, like everything in this movie, it's rushed and over too quickly. The Monster burns down the cottage and makes his way towards Geneva to strike vengeance on Victor and his family.    He murders Victor's brother, William and this death causes his maid, Justine to be executed wrongfully.  Victor and the Monster meet each other in a brightly lit ice cave and the scene makes the Monster appear morea wizened indian than a patchwork monster. He demands a mate and of course, Victor does not go through. We're spared the gory destruction of the would be bride from the novel because Vic doesen't even get that far.    The Monster stalks him down and kills Elizabeth on there wedding night and this leads to the film's silliest moment. In a truly dramatic departure from the novel, Victor actually reanimates Elizabeth and the Monster and her fight over her. It's a ridiculous scene and shoudl have been excised. Perhaps this was to replace the \\"destruction of the Bride\\" sequence but it's poor compensation. And what's worse.....the creepiest and best writing in the novel is not here! Now mind you, this is a long film, but to cut Victor's hunt for the Monster was a truly poor decision.    The film ends in the Arctic and Victor passes on from exhaustion. The Monster weeps over his corpse and a funeral is held before the ice breaks and lots of stuntwork is evidenced. The Monster intones to Walton, who actually suggest that the criminal psychopath join them(!) that he is \\"done with man\\" and burns himself(and Victor's corpse, on a fuineral pyre.    Walton and his crew decide to go home and we could care less and we press the eject button and try to determine what we just saw.    Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is not a good movie. It's hardly even a decent one, but it's so fascinating in it's failings that it's a must for review.  A reason for it's failing are numerous. Branagh is not bad in the lead role, just miscast. Deniro is decent but remains doggedly Denirosih throughout the course of the picture, evoking one of the pathos of Karloff or any of the terror of the novel.  It's main problem may be that the film is afraid to actually be scary, seeming to forget that this is a Horror story afterall.  A con current production made to cash in on this film, made by TNT and starring Patrick Bergin as the doctor and Randy Quaid as the Monster, was not great but was an example of a lowerbudgeted competitor being the more interesting film.  Two other film adaptions are actually more faithful. The creepiest and most disturbing was the 1976 Swedish/Irish production of \\"Terror of Frankenstein\\" with Leon Vitalli as Frankenstein and a haunting, Per Oscarrson as a ghoulish Monster. Hallmark made an epic three hour film version(!) in 2004 that was just as faithful and alot more satisfying than the Branagh film. It was well acted and photographed, it's only fault(that it shared with the 1994 version) was that it was not that scary.    Branagh's film at the very least is an intriguing footnote in the history of the Famous Monster story and is still required viewing for fans of the story and the curious Horror fan.    This DVD edition is the way to see it, showing off one of the film's genuine assets: that being it's widescreen cinematography. It's basically bare bones though, save for a few trailers. I'd love to see a Special Edition someday to perhaps learn more about the production of this most interesting of Box Office flops.
6305127646|5.0|If you are in love, have been in love or just been in love w/ the idea of being in love; The Saint is just the movie to see.  Not only is it action packed (from beginning to end), comical at times and fantastic to watch (location wise); it is one of my favorite love stories.  The connection between Elisabeth Shue's and Val Kilmer's character is amazingly stunning.  Anyone in their right mind would appeal to their chemistry.  However, I personally feel that one other thing should be mentioned; the movie score.  Simply amazing!  Graeme Revell (who has done the score to such movies as \\"The Crow\\" and \\"Strange Days\\" overwhelms with this score as it is enchantingly beautiful and definitely one of my favorites.  In conclusion, this movies has everything that a movies should have and it is so underrated.

B001MYIXAW|1.0|One of the best films ever. however, this blu-ray destroyed it. this is not the theatrical release. this is a version made for the masses of illiterate that cannot watch a film unless english is spoken. the entire film was ruined by the awkward english dubbing.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Just wanted to say that if you haven't already bought this album, don't walk...run to buy it! how this album was never a hit, I'll never understand and don't believe what half the media say about it, I bet that, after all the Clive' crap, most of them didn't even bother to listen to it!
1439138311|4.0|This is my first exposure to this particular author and I will be seeking out his other books based upon what I read here.<br /><br />Eilis Lacey was born in a small Irish town and is suffering through the lack of job and life opportunties of the depressed Irish economy following WWII. Her family and a Catholic priest make arrangements for her to pursue opportunties in the United States (Brooklyn) by acquiring a job and going back to school to further her education. We follow her life from the time she was in Ireland, through the crossing to the United States, and then observe how she settles into her new home. We share her fears and frustrations as she experiences in this totally foreign world. The call to return to Ireland is strong and as the novel unfolds, the reader finds out if the pull back is strong enough to override her developing comfort with life in Brooklyn.<br /><br />I used the word \\"subtle\\" to describe this novel because it fits it perfectly. The beginning of the book moves slowly and not much appears to be happening when I eventually realized I was totally drawn into the story and mesmerized. The writing is relatively simple and straightforward but manages to convey to the reader absolutely everything the reader needs to know - therefore, subtle. In a novel of this sort, it would be easy to over-write and to become verbose and flowery -- that doesn't happen. My only real complaint is with the character of \\"Tony\\" whom she meets in Brooklyn at a dance and he becomes a main character as the book moves along. He didn't ring true for me and seemed just too perfect. Not three-dimensional to me.<br /><br />The book reminds me a lot of \\"Empire Falls\\" by Richard Russo in the keen observation skills and sharp analysis of the place and time. Since \\"Empire Falls\\" is one of my all-time favorite novels, that is a strong endoresment.
B000O76TA4|5.0|i've seen this before but i was shown things i hadn't before.    it is so excellent!!
B0026UV77C|2.0|I love Placebo, and I completely adored their last two records.  The nuance, the fluidity of both Molko's subversive musical sexuality and of the production, and the steadily developing songwriting have all been real strong suits for the band.    So why, oh, why did they make this big dumb guitar album?  It is filled with mindless hooks, no chord changes, and bland lyrics that erase any of the fey posing or the queer existentialism that made Placebo the great band they have been.      I had to get to track 5 before there was a song I could enjoy at all.  There are some high points, mind you, but the choice of producers and the self-conscious decision to \\"rock\\" (a trap that sadly catches nearly every group as they approach forty) make this their worst album since their mostly unremarkable debut.  And even that had a neuroticism that was at least interesting, if not good.  This record doesn't even exhibit that.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet DVD is excellent.  The DVD was received in excellent condition and before scheduled delivery date.
B0000508U6|5.0|Simply fantastic! Coldplay has scored with all of their albums, but this is far and away their best. I think what sets it apart is it's careful attention to vulnerable melody... it literally gives me goosebumps (listen to \\"We Never Change\\" and reintroduce yourself to a Coldplay that undersings, underplays and sounds flat amazing.) Other Coldplay albums are also well worth picking up! Perhaps in this order:    Parachutes  X&Y  Rush of Blood to the Head  Viva La Vida/Propekt's March EP
B001UREJWM|4.0|First...this is a very, very good album.  It is about what I expected, with some great tunes and some so-so.  If you like Dio and/or Dio-Sabbath...BUY IT...you won't be disappointed.    However, Heaven And Hell needs a second guitarist.  What was best about Dio (to me) was how he sung with the guitar and visa-versa.  That is missing here, and Dio's melodies, as great as they are on this album, come off a bit separated from the songs.  Also, from a wanna-be-producer's point of view, Tony needs a little more treble and scream from his guitar tone to regain more of the Mob Rules sound that many of us love so much.  Again, a second guitarist, handling the \\"filling rhythm\\" of the guitar parts of the song, would allow Iommi to concentrate on his near-perfect-and-erie lead work.    So...Heaven And Hell...Tony...Ronnie...GREAT ALBUM!!!  But if you guys really want to be back on top (in my book), I suggest a bit more of an artistic production of sound and less of what the record company may \\"think\\" is good.  Grab that raw, mean tone again and I'm sure your next album will rule.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is the tale of an extraordinary robot, who longs for love.  It's also a tale of hope, beauty, human life, and learning responsibility.  This is a great film for all ages.  Pixar has certainly done it again!
B001H9MWW2|5.0|This is a terrific \\"combo\\" album pack. \\"Viva La Vida\\" is epic and beautiful with huge and broad-scoped songs that succeed in taking my breath away. \\"Prospekt's March\\" is probably even better, with songs that are more intimate and soothing (more like old school Coldplay.)    However, who's idea was it to slap Jay-Z on here? That was an awful idea...

B001P5Q6FC|3.0|Lamb of God's newest release, Wrath, leaves much to be desired in terms of overall musicianship and enjoyability.  Sadly, Wrath is no different than any previous album Lamb of God have produced.      The guitars, drums, and even vocals are all terribly average on this album-they don't make you cringe, but they don't induce fits of wanting to sing or growl along, either.  The guitar riffs are not nearly as catchy as on Sacrament, and the overall song-writing is toned down.      This release shows exactly why Lamb of God are on a major record label.  The production isn't quite shoddy, but it isn't spectacular, either.  If fans wanted to grind their hearts out with this album, it isn't going to happen.  The lines and riffs simply do not flow together with ease.  Guitar solos are misplaced and sometimes seem forced-an overbearing attempt at being 'radio-friendly'.  This aspect of Wrath is simply not impressive.  We've seen it all before, countless times.      Also worth noting is the Explicit tag on the album cover.  The big thing about having the explicit tag is the message it sends off to the kids: \\"Buy this album because there is swearing and it is cool.\\"  That tag never speaks to me.  It is almost as if the band couldn't come up with anything better than mindless swearing.      Don't get me wrong, Wrath is not a bad album.  It is simply easier to pass over than several other NWOAHM bands.  I won't bring it back to the store, but it probably won't see much time in my CD player, either.    Sadly, I can't give Wrath any more than 3.2 stars out of a possible 5.  It is just too average for my tastes.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|Keith Urban's last album was a little spotty, but his most recent release is spot on.  It has consistently good, strong music, reflecting his distinctive style, and honest lyrics.  He's a very lucky man who isn't afraid to let the world know that he has come through a bad patch in his life thanks to a good and loving wife.  And as the world seems to have gone completely nuts, it's refreshing to listen to songs that deal with the basics of life and remind us that life is to be enjoyed.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|Visually, this is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen.  Every period in the film, from the roaring '20s of Benjamin's earliest years, to the 1960s when he lived briefly with the girl of his dreams, are captured almost perfectly onscreen.  The cinematography is practically flawless.  The film is so wonderfully atmospheric it's almost worth watching for that alone.  The special effects are remarkable as well.  At different points in the film, both Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt are made to look roughly twenty years younger than their actual ages.  This is relatively new in film.  It's been possible since the medium began to age actors with makeup, but now it's also possible to de-age them through the magic of CGI.  So where it would once have only been possible to make this film using very young actors to play the leads, and use make up to age them into their 40s and 50s and beyond, they can now cast established stars in their 40s and still have them convincingly play characters just out of their teens.  The technical wizardry behind this is amazing, and it's yet another example of the magic of the movies.<br /><br />So on technical merits alone I'd give the film 5 out of 5 stars.  Unfortunately, the story does not quite live up to that high standard.  It's not bad, to be sure; I did enjoy the movie, but I couldn't help wonder, at the end of it all, what the point was.  As the reviewer for the Sunday Times aptly put it: \\"It's a gimmick that goes on for nearly three hours.\\"  Now I don't think every story has to have a moral, or a great message, or all kinds of weighty allusions and themes, and so forth.  But simple, escapist entertainment just works better as a comedy or an action piece.  A moody, character-driven drama, one can't help but feel, ought to have a little more to say.  This movie, enjoyable as it is, seems like nothing more than an exercise in \\"what if\\" thinking -- what if a man could age backward?  What would that be like?  Storywise, the film seems to have nothing to offer beyond that, and one really doesn't need a 2 1/2 hour film to spell out all the sorrowful ramifications of such a scenario.<br /><br />Still, the film is good for an evening's entertainment, and is a feast for the eyes.  Cate Blanchett is nearly always worth watching, and Pitt gives a very good performance as well.have nothing to offer beyond that, and one really doesn't need a 2 1/2 hour film to spell out all the sorrowful ramifications of such a scenario.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|And Winwood's great, too.  I like both musicians and think they deserve credit for not just recycling and touring on their hits from the 70s. Because they are playing together on this concert, they do focus on music from Blind Faith and Traffic eras.  Still, when I got this cd, I didn't expect such a great song selection and such intense instrumental interplay.  Clapton gets a lot of room to develop strong solos and puts in some of his most powerful and energetic work to date.  Superb solos on Presence of the Lord, Them Changes, Can't Find My Way Home, After Midnight, and a long version of Voodoo Child (Winwood played organ on the Hendrix original).  Winwood is in fine voice and has some good moments on keyboard.  A fine album that exceeded my expectations.  This is a great one to turn up loud.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|A brilliant movie it is not. Nor is it on the same level as Irreversible or Inside. It sadly falls short of being a good movie weighed down by it's own aspirations. One reviewer was quite correct stating that martyrs sacrifice themselves willingly, just the opposite of what unfolds in this film. The first half is a very good thriller with good scares and adept filmmaking. Then it falls apart. The middle losing all pace and drags on with seemingly endless fade-ins and outs and in the process turning the viewer numb to the violence. Then the movie turns into a new age enlightenment concept that sucks the wind right out of the film. Even the predictible and very Hollywood ending ruins what little was left to salvage in terms of a story. Many reviewers are trying too hard to read into this film and they don't see where the director lost control and tried his best to wrap it up. It is an ambitious film and might have actually been a true masterpiece with more planning and better direction.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|What a wonderful adaptation of \\"Little Dorrit\\".  Every character was well cast and believable. My only \\"complaint\\" was that sometimes it was hard to catch some of the dialogue, especially with Rigaud, who with his heavy French accent often menacingly dropped his voice.  However, as the film has so much in it, it is definitely worth viewing a second or third time in order to catch all the threads.  Enjoy!
B00005OB0A|5.0|It's never easy to define appeal of a particular singer's music, but it's especially difficult where Kylie's music is concerned. I became a Kylie fan at the beginning when she was with Stock, Aitken and Waterman, despite not caring much for most of the music that they produced. Kylie wasn`t the only Stock, Aitken and Waterman artist whose music I liked, as I also like Bananarama and Jason Donovan, but I can`t think of any others. Nevertheless, Kylie's music has changed a lot since then. I also enjoy her later music, but in a different way. Yet through all the changes, Kylie's music isn't and never has been typical of what I normally listen to. So I guess it's down to the quality of the songs and Kylie's wonderful voice, both of which are well up to the expected standard on this album.<br /><br />Four British top ten hits came from this album, which also revitalized Kylie's career in America. The first and biggest of these hits, Can't get you out of my head, made number one in Britain and became a huge hit in America and around the world. Nothing else here matched the achievements of that song, but the other three hits here (In your eyes, Love at first sight, Come into my world) are all excellent. The title track was presumably considered for single released but, at least in Britain, wasn't released in that form. It's worth noting that all the songs here are originals, even though a couple of them (Fever, More more more) use titles of old songs made famous by others.<br /><br />Typical of Kylie`s albums from the early years of the new millennium, this album works well whether played as background music or listened to without other distractions. Overall, I have a slight preference for the album that followed this (Body language) and the one that preceded it (Light years), but there's really not a lot to choose between them. If you enjoy any of the three, you'll also enjoy the other two.
6305428425|4.0|Romy White (Mira Sorvino) and Michele Weinberger (Lisa Kudrow) have been friends since they met at Sagebrush High in Tucson. Since then they both moved to Los Angeles, and they live together, but other than getting out of Tucson they are what might be described as under achievers. Michele is unemployed and Romy works as a cashier in the service department of a Jaguar dealership. They do, however, have flair, style, and share a unique fashion sense.<br /><br />At the Jaguar dealership Romy recognizes Heather Mooney (Janeanne Garofalo), another Sagebrush alumna, in line. Heather is obviously doing well if she can afford a Jag. She has no time for old High School chums, and barely conceals her disdain, until Heather hears that Romy is still friends with Michele, and it is revealed that Heather had a crush on Sandy Frink (Alan Cumming), who totaled ignored Heather because of his infatuation with Michele.<br /><br />Michele, for her part, was indifferent to Sandy's affection, because Sandy was kind of a dork. They called him the Frink-a-zoid, and isn't that always the way it is with these love triangles, or perhaps it was a trapezoid or even a rhomboid, or some other kind of oblique-angled parallelogram with unequal adjacent sides<br /><br />The 10-Year High School Reunion looms on the horizon and the die is cast. Though Heather claims she wouldn't be caught dead there, they all have a date with destiny.<br /><br />Romy and Michele want to lose weight, get good jobs, and good boyfriends. When two weeks proves to be too short a time to meet their objectives, they go to Plan B: Claim to be the inventors of Post-Its, and therefore rich and successful. That plan doesn't really work out, either, but at least we get a good comedy romp where scores are settled, lessons are learned, and a good time is had by most.<br /><br />Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow create quite the whacky kooks. Though Sorvino won an Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite, she doesn't have to resort to quite such a cartoonish voice for her Romy. Though Sorvino is certainly talented, I always thought that Oscar she won for Aphrodite was kind of a My Cousin Vinnyish fluke. If I could hand out Oscars, she'd get one for this movie instead. The part where she tells off the queen bee of the \\"A\\" group alone could qualify her for one.<br /><br />Romy and Michele are bottle blonde bimbos, but their dark roots are showing. Lisa Kudrow received a degree in Biology from Vassar College, and Mira Sorvino a degree in Asian Studies from Harvard University, so during production of Romy and Michele, they nicknamed each other \\"Smart\\" and \\"Smarter\\".<br /><br />An excellent counterbalance to their blonde humor is the dark and bitter Janeanne Garofalo. She makes those withering remarks that you wish you would've thought of back when you were being tormented in High School. She is a tough cookie, but then she has that vulnerable side. She can take the most polite and pedestrian prose, but through her brilliant delivery you sense the subtle malice seething underneath that thin veneer.<br /><br />Alan Cumming made a great dork, and though he was kind of a deus ex machina, plot wise, he does get to finally dance with his beloved Michele, though only if Romy can dance with her, so it is still a triangle, albeit an isosceles triangle with the two equal sides of Romy and Michele. It is an interesting twist on the whole dance at the prom or reunion scene, and is set to the lovely 80's ballad \\"Time After Time\\" by Cyndi Lauper. The title fits in well with the whole reunion theme, too.<br /><br />Director David Mirkin does a great job for someone who has mostly worked in television. He keeps the jokes and pop culture references flowing -- Mary Tyler Moore Show, Pretty Woman, Footloose -- he has the boys in the Jaguar Service Department watching The Simpsons, and as an inside joke, it is one that he directed. Though he worked mostly in television, it was good television. Besides The Simpsons, there was the brilliant but short lived Chris Elliot vehicle Get a Life, Newhart, and The Larry Sanders Show. Mirkin did a great job directing this film, and even his name is funny.<br /><br />Although I told myself I was looking merely for a soothing presence, a  glorified pot-au-feu, an animated merkin, I settled for \\"Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.\\" Ah, the High School Reunion Genre, it must have been something in the zeitgeist of 1997, because that year also saw the release of \\"Grosse Pointe Blank,\\" also featuring a 10-Year High School Reunion; only this one had a better selection of music, and the protagonist, Martin Q. Blank, was a professional hit man, so his problem was what to tell people he did for a living since graduating.<br /><br />The shot gun marriage of action movie with High School Reunion comedy that was \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" didn't work nearly as well as R&M'sHSR, but Romy and Michele also had trouble telling people what they did for a living, since Romy was a cashier, and Michele was unemployed.

B000063DI8|1.0|This album could have been done by any of the other metal bands that were around at the same time.  Tthe first song \\"Tailgunner\\" is the only gem, the rest of the album doesn't have the classic Maiden sound, with the time changes, and guitar solos that turn into full band instrumentals.  It's hard to imagine it being the same band that did Powerslave, Piece Of Mind, or Number Of The Beast.  Just my opinion.
B001IAO2QE|1.0|Somehow I had never read any of Ayn Rand's work before and decided that I should probably make a start as I had heard a lot about her from my friends when I was a school girl about 15 years ago. I thought I enjoyed the book in the first few chapters and then as I progressed the characters started to seem a little too juvenile. But what blew me off was the ending! So enduring the rest of the book I decided to stick it out until the end only to be betrayed by the author.  Common you have got to be kidding me with an ending like that! Ridiculous, beats me as to why this is such a popular book. I have read a lot bad books but none enraged me like this one.   Juvenile characters, silly plot, bad writing..... in my opinion this book would serve as a good tutorial on 'how not to write a book', albeit a very lengthy one!
B000BBOV8U|5.0|This compilation of music by one of Canada's most important singers is presented in approximate chronological order, beginning in 1980 with Remember. The first Bryan Adams song that I became familiar with is Straight from the heart, which became his first top ten hit in America. It wasn't a hit for him in Britain but Bonnie Tyler covered it for her album, Faster than the speed of night. A hugely successful album that spawned a British and American number one hit, Total eclipse of the heart, it surely can't have harmed Bryan's career to have a cover of one of his songs on such a successful album, even though his name among the credits may not have meant anything to many Brits who bought the album at the time. Meanwhile in America, two follow-up singles to Straight from the heart (Cuts like a knife, This time) gained respectable top thirty chart placings.<br /><br />It didn't take long before Bryan's singles started charting in Britain as well as America, although his British chart placings have generally (but not always) been lower than the corresponding American placings. By far the biggest hit of his career in either country is the Robin Hood movie theme, Everything I do. Number one in both countries, it spent sixteen consecutive weeks there in Britain. Bryan has returned to the number one spot in Britain just once, with Chicane on Don't give up. His other British top ten hits include Thought I'd died and gone to heaven, Please forgive me, All for love (with Rod Stewart and Sting), Have you ever really loved a woman?, The only thing that looks good on me is you, When you're gone (with Melanie C, a former member of the Spice Girls), Cloud number nine and Here I am. Most of these songs (and some others) also made the top ten in America.<br /><br />Apart from the collaborations already mentioned, Bryan also teamed up with Tina Turner (It's only love) and Bonnie Raitt (Rock steady - though this is really a Bonnie Raitt solo for which Bryan wrote the song and provided instrumental backing). All the songs I've mentioned, along with many others, can be found on this wonderful double CD.<br /><br />Bryan's mix of up-tempo rocking songs and slow romantic ballads doesn't please everybody but it pleases me immensely. His universal appeal cuts across many genres of music. Country singer T G Sheppard and Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins are among those who have covered Everything I do. Similarly, country group Highway 101 and the classical crossover group Il Divo both covered Have you ever really loved a woman?<br /><br />In an age where musicians seemed to introduce complexity for its own sake, Bryan Adams opted for the simple approach. His music is raw rock'n'roll that has just enough embellishment to appeal to contemporary music fans, yet has a basic simplicity that appeals to older listeners.

1861976127|5.0|The author is a self-confessed stickler for punctuation, yet what this book makes clear is that punctuation itself is only a few hundred years old, which is modest when you think that writing is much older than that. Furthermore, it is continually evolving, just like language itself. I'm certainly not going to claim that my punctuation is perfect, because I know it isn't. Within Amazon reviews, I deliberately don't use quotation marks around titles (although I use them elsewhere),  not least because Amazon's software historically behaved strangely when confronted by quotation marks. Maybe those quirks are consigned to history, but I continue writing reviews without quotation marks for the sake of consistency.<br /><br />Another problem for the author is my use of CD's to indicate more than one CD, where she says the apostrophe is wrong. I adopted the convention because it is widely accepted and looks better - unlike book's, which I'll never use as a plural; I'll only use in its correct context, for example the book's title. I also tend to use more commas than some people may think is necessary, but I'd rather use too many than too few. Reading this book, it is clear that the rules for commas are imprecise, though there are some situations where the presence or absence of a comma makes a lot of difference.<br /><br />Over and above my obvious disregard for those (and maybe other) rules, I make errors too, though hopefully not too many. Meanwhile, the author may be a stickler for punctuation but did not research the meaning of a Scottish sentence that she used in her book, simply stating that she had no idea what it meant. (The answer is somewhere on this page.)<br /><br />After a lengthy introduction (a chapter in itself, running to more than thirty pages), the author devotes several chapters to different punctuation marks, illustrating how much difference the various marks make. It is clear that using no punctuation marks would make text difficult to read, but the author emphasizes that you can completely change, or even reverse, the meaning of text depending on how it is punctuated.<br /><br />The letter from Jill to Jack is particularly funny. The author presents one version where Jill thinks Jack is perfect and an alternative in which she thinks Jack is useless. No words are different, just the punctuation and associated capital letters. For those of you who like to test yourself, I present you with an un-punctuated version (not easy to force through a word processor, so I wrote it in Notepad and pasted it in), from which you can work out how to achieve these contrasting results. In working out your solutions, you may use periods (we Brits call them full stops), capital letters, commas, question marks, apostrophes, exclamation marks, colons and semicolons (but you won't need all of them). Note that it might be possible to arrive at slightly different solutions to those in the book. Here goes<br /><br />dear jack i want a man who knows what love is all about you are generous kind thoughtful people who are not like you admit to being useless and inferior you have ruined me for other men i yearn for you i have no feelings whatsoever when were apart i can be forever happy will you let me be yours jill<br /><br />If you can't work out both answers, you definitely need this book.

B000GG4KTU|5.0|Most of these songs are likely to be familiar to anybody who has built up a collection of music written by such composers as Irving Berlin, Jimmy Van Heusen, Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and their contemporaries. They are all songs of the highest quality that have been covered many times down the years. Until comparatively recently, pop and rock singers raised in the aftermath of rock'n'roll tended to ignore such songs, but even some of them have now realized how great these songs are (or how much money they can make by recording them). Diana has recorded several albums of such material, though this was her first for some time.<br /><br />The tracks here fall into two categories, seven tracks being recorded with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra while the other five were recorded without them. The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra features John Clayton as arranger and conductor of 29 other musicians. John Clayton plays bass on the tracks without the orchestra, while Jeff Hamilton plays drums on all tracks, whether as a member of the orchestra or not. There are plenty of instrumental solos throughout the album featuring various musicians, including three tracks (It could happen to you, Day in day out, Willow weep for me) where Diana plays piano solo. All these solos mean that some tracks last longer (occasionally much longer) than they normally would, but the whole album works well.<br /><br />This is a wonderful album that ought to please Diana's many fans though, once again, it relies heavily on ballads. It would have been nice to have one or two up-tempo tracks to provide a contrast but that's a minor quibble. Diana obviously loves singing ballads and it seems to be what most fans buy her music for.

B001EOOQEC|4.0|I don't care what anyone says- the fact that Dio came back to Sabbath for this album DOES increase the quality of the songwriting, if only a little bit, at least it's better than many of those generic mid to late 80's albums Sabbath was pumping out.     One thing I find very odd about Dehumanizer is how the songs feel completely out of order.  The opening song is STRANGE.  Oh sure, it has an extremely heavy Sabbath riff, but it doesn't sound right when combined with Dio's vocals.  I think Dio is off here with his legendary vocal style, despite the song being very enjoyable anyway.    Some other moments on the album resemble the Holy Diver days of Dio (you know, the classic years).  Actually, while the album goes on, each song gradually shifts into a direction that more resembles Dio than anything Black Sabbath has done.   I noticed by the final track the album felt more like a solo Dio album than a Sabbath album.      Also, I like this album more than the music Ozzy was creating around this time.  Just throwing that out there :)    Honestly, I found myself enjoying most of the songs from this album.  A few generic moments aside maybe, but nothing TOO overwhelming to be concerned about.    To sum it up- Dehumanizer is no classic Black Sabbath album, and I believe Mob Rules was the last classic album the band ever made, but it's still a pretty good album that Sabbath and Dio fans should try out to see if they like.  I think they WILL like it.
B0012XT6WM|1.0|When someone makes the point of making the public aware that a DVD is \\"fully licensed\\" and not a bootleg, and the offending DVD is coming from our friends in South Korea preying on foreign copyrights, red flags should be going up immediately.    Here is yet another South Korean company stealing U.S. manufactured product and duplicating it with no fear of either litigation or American federal authorities showing up on their doorstep, as they are protected by their own government which is a huge part of the problem in international IP piracy, as they not only condone these illegal activities, but support them.

B001PA0FFO|3.0|Most playwrights should never direct their own work. John Patrick Shanley's 2008 adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning &#34;Doubt&#34; cries for the guiding hand of filmmaker Sidney Lumet, a master at stage-to-screen translation. Though Shanley has assembled a memorable cast, he knows little about cinematic technique. &#34;Doubt&#34; lacks the overall dramatic impact of its Broadway counterpart — even the denouement falls flat. Fortunately, the actors are excellent. Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams make the film version worth watching, yet it is Viola Davis' heart-wrenching portrayal that stays in the memory. However, you must see &#34;Doubt&#34; on stage to fully appreciate its emotional power.

Maybe in 15 more years they will release the whole show on video.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I was very skeptical about this show when I first heard about it, being a huge fan of the first two movies. I watched part of the pilot when it aired but it didnt grab me. Then after about a year and a half later, I decided to give it another chance.    For the first three episodes I was entertained, but not very impressed. However, during these episodes there were hints that the show had a lot of potential. And starting at the fourth episode the show just took off. It only took a few more episodes for me to decide that this was the best show I've ever seen. The writing is fantastic, the storylines take brilliant twists and turns, and the acting is pitch perfect.     This is not just an action dominated show like I predicted. It is a compelling and complex show that you can't sit through casually. It assumes that its audience is intelligent and prefers extremely well-drawn characters rather than gimmicks and predictable writing.    I would highly suggest this DVD set as well as the second season, which comes out in a few months. The second season takes everything further and will really blow your mind.

0321344758|5.0|I recently had a chance to participate in several usability studies of a software product we're developing, done on a much bigger budget than what Steve Krug is talking about in his book. I can vouch that the advice he gives about usability testing makes perfect sense. That's only a part of this book though, and not the best one at that.    The meat of this book is the approach to usability that makes it less of a \\"personal opinion of the highest ranking stakeholders on the project\\" and more of a \\"predictable practice with verifiable results\\" kind of thing. After reading this book you will have a chance not to judge usability by a vote or by a developer who was asked to build a feature.    One thing the book doesn't do is make the case that usability is important, with any significant evidence for or against. You'll have to make this choice and find support for following up on this choice by yourself.    One last thing: I happen not to like most of the suggestions for additional reading, especially for more recently published books. Start with the titles that are presented in the book, and find better ones by browsing similar items in your favorite bookstore.

A masterpiece album that I truly wish George would have remixed himself as this ridiculous Phil Spector \\"Wall Of Sound\\" essentially KILLS all these beautiful songs. My only hope rests with Dhani Harrison, who I wish would take the original tapes and remix it so that it has none of the echo that is responsible for among other things, the breakup of the Beatles. John Lennon sure picked some winners: Yoko Ono, Allen Klein, and Phil Spector - all untalented moochers and parasites whose only talent was to live off the earnings and work of other people. Of the three, the most evil is still alive and free, one has died and gone off to meat Margaret Thatcher and Hitler, and the other is in jail for life. Phil Spector should have gone to prison long ago for his awful mixes that only low self-esteem artists (Lennon, Harrison) and drug addicts could have possibly found any value in them. It is also a pity Brian Wilson greatly admired the Caligula of the recording Studio and proceeded to mix all Beach Boys albums in the same abominable manner.

For those who don't know, Playing for Change represents a group of filmmakers and sound engineers who have travelled world wide to record performances from various artists...everyone from the ultra-famous Bono to the well-known performer Keb' Mo' and, perhaps more importantly, nearly one hundred buskers, grassroots folk singers, choir singers, classical musicians etc. from every corner of the globe.  They cover songs by Bob Marley, Peter Gabriel, U2, Tracy Chapman and Sam Cooke, all with the end goal of inspiring peace and change.  And, as the video for \\"Stand By Me\\" makes clear, some of these artists have never even met - their recordings are skillfully managed and spliced together to create a whole.  My personal fave is Grandpa Elliot and Clarence Bekker's version of \\"A Change is Gonna Come,\\" which references the city of New Orleans post-Katrina.

1933771690|2.0|A recent article by Robert Lanza and Bob Berman, \\"The Biocentric Universe--subtitled \\"A radical new view of reality: Life creates time, space, and the cosmos itself,\\" appeared in the May 2009 Discover magazine.  In metaphysical circles, there's nothing new about vapid assertions that \\"we create our own reality.\\"  But this was in a popular science magazine, so I supposed that it must be serious science, and I read their book Biocentrism which expands on the article.     Citing quantum-mechanical experiments showing that subatomic entities can be in indefinite states until measured by observers, and the strange coincidence that the parameters of the physical universe seem to be perfectly tuned to permit life, they propose that these things are consistent with \\"biocentrism, which holds that the universe is created by life and not the other way around.\\"  But to make this inverted causation work on a cosmic scale, they also propose that time and space are illusions.     The book's essence is the set of principles below, derived at the end of corresponding chapters:      First Principle of Biocentrism: What we perceive as reality is a process that involves our consciousness. An \\"external\\" reality, if it existed, would--by definition--have to exist in space. But this is meaningless, because space and time are not absolute realities but rather tools of the human and animal mind.    Second Principle of Biocentrism: Our external and internal perceptions are inextricably intertwined. They are different sides of the same coin and cannot be divorced from one another.    Third Principle of Biocentrism: The behavior of subatomic particles--indeed all particles and objects--is inextricably linked to the presence of an observer. Without the presence of a conscious observer, they at best exist in an undetermined state of probability waves.    Fourth Principle of Biocentrism: Without consciousness, \\"matter\\" dwells in an undetermined state of probability. Any universe that could havepreceded consciousness only existed in a probability state.    Fifth Principle of Biocentrism: The structure of the universe is explainable only through biocentrism. The universe is fine-tuned for life, which makes perfect sense as life creates the universe, not the other way around. The \\"universe\\" is simply the complete spatio-temporal logic of the self.    Sixth Principle of Biocentrism: Time does not have a real existence outside of animal-sense perception. It is the process by which we perceive changes in the universe.    Seventh Principle of Biocentrism: Space, like time, is not an object or a thing. Space is another form of our animal understanding and does not have an independent reality. We carry space and time around with us like turtles with shells. Thus, there is no absolute self-existing matrix in which physical events occur independent of life.     The authors berate \\"contemporary\\" or \\"Western\\" science for asking us to believe that \\"the entire universe, exquisitely tailored for our existence, popped into existence out of absolute nothingness.  Who in their right mind would accept such a thing?\\"  But that is not the only concept entertained by scientists, and that the universe has always existed in some sense (if a probability state constitutes existence) seems to me no less baffling.  And there is no such thing as \\"contemporary\\" or \\"Western\\" science--there is only real science or pseudoscience.  Real science requires that hypotheses should, at least in principle, offer testable predictions.  I cannot see this in their Principles.     Lanza and Berman repeatedly stress the need to reinterpret time and space, and say \\"change is not the same thing as time,\\" but they do not explain how to grasp this.  I understand that different conscious beings will subjectively experience the rate and scale of time and space otherwise than we do, but it does not follow that there are no corresponding objective entities that are outside conscious experience, or that sequential process itself is escapable or reversible.  Indeed, these authors, like all of us, use language in which flow from past to future, from there to here, is inextricably embedded.     To explain how their biocentric concept might mesh with the detailed evidence of cosmic and biological evolution implicit in astronomical observations and the geologic record, in which organic life appears as a late and sparsely-distributed phenomenon, they liken the cosmos to a phonograph record in which an entire musical performance exists simultaneously.  But they do not make clear how we might experience the universe from such a perspective.     There are also many complicated questions implicit in the idea that the universe \\"collapses\\" into a definite state only as a function of living observers.  Who or what qualifies as \\"observers\\" and \\"observations\\"?  Can one individual pull off this trick, or is it a collective effect of life in general?  How nearly human do the living things have to be?  Is it intentional or involuntary?  Why are we not aware of our role in cosmic creation?     The authors imply that consciousness, at an animal level of life, is key to the cosmos-defining process.  It would therefore seem important to establish what is necessary for developing and maintaining consciousness.  They admit that they do not know, but in their chapter \\"Death and Eternity,\\" they nevertheless declare that \\"the mathematical possibility of your consciousness ending is zero\\", and \\"energy keeps changing forms, but it never diminishes in the least.  Similarly, the essence of who you are, which is energy, can neither diminish nor 'go away'...\\"     This identification of consciousness with energy seems to me too simple.  One's life, and the associated consciousness, I view as a patterned process, akin to a candle flame or standing wave, in which energy flow serves to sustain a particular, relatively-stable form.  But the pattern, not the energy, is central to identity--and when the energyflow goes outside narrow limits, or veers elsewhere, the living pattern can and does disappear.     Lanza and Berman's attempt to establish biocentrism as the key to the nature of reality is ambitious and provocative, but does not convince me.  It is not clear that awareness is necessary to raw existence.

The Lies of Locke Lamora is a strong start and I truly hope it only gets better.  I'll start nitpicking when it is a trilogy. ;)
B001O1O71C|4.0|i read this book rather quickly but did have to brush up on my WW2 history while reading this. It seemed unrealistic that a boy with such a high powered father was oblivious to what he did and who he worked under, however the story line is wonderful and easy to follow. This book is definately for adults or a young adult reader, not a child though.

0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a very intricately layered novel.  While the book mainly centers on two separate mysteries that are loosely connected due to the players involved, it also deals--almost casually--with everyday violence and especially violence against women.  It is the frequency of this violence in the novel that makes it so disturbing.<br /><br />The novel's most interesting character is Lisbeth Salander.  Lisbeth is a social misfit with a core of anger simmering just below her surface.  The author is coy about what it is that motivates Lisbeth but the reader is given some hints as to past events in Lisbeth's life that have led her to become the very antisocial person she has become.  Her methods of dealing with events in her life are unorthodox, to say the least, but she is a very sympathetic character and I found myself both rooting for her and feeling her pain.<br /><br />Aside from Lisbeth, the novel has a pretty vast cast of characters who are all very well-drawn and unique.  Larsson's characters are very three dimensional and lifelike.  His Vanger clan is filled with truly diverse characters.<br /><br />The two mysteries at the core of the novel are both fascinating in their own right.  One of the mysteries has to do with the disappearance of Harriet Vanger nearly fifty years previous while the other has to do with the activities of a prominent and much-lauded Swedish businessman.  Larsson does a deft job of weaving these two stories together, even though the two have no real connection to one another and each would have been enough in and of itself to constitute a novel.<br /><br />At its heart, this is a dark story of indifference to--if not acceptance of--violence.  Whether Larsson is describing crimes against women or the rise of the Nazi movement in Sweden, Larsson is making a statement.  The crimes he describes aren't exactly rare and I had a sense of anger that more or less permeates every page.  It seems as though Larsson wants to draw attention to the ills of his country and I was left with the impression that perhaps Sweden--like many other nations--sometimes has the tendency to overlook its problems rather than acknowledge the horror of them.ountry and I was left with the impression that perhaps Sweden--like many other nations--sometimes has the tendency to overlook its problems rather than acknowledge the horror of them.
0307341569|5.0|\\"Dark Places\\" is a story that will stay with you long after the read, a troubled contemplation that when reflected upon later, you will end up asking yourself why your reality has just tilted slightly off kilter.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn has taken the reader to desperate depths as she paints the tale of slovenly Libby Day, whose survival of a brutal farm massacre at age seven has tainted every day of her adult life. With her brother behind bars for nearly 24 years now, convicted of the murders, and the money running out, Libby is offered the opportunity from an unlikely source to sift through the ruins of her life, and probe the memories, the dark places, to find out who was really behind the massacre.<br /><br />But such growth does not come easily, and truth does not come without a cost, and somewhere out there a murderer(s) is still running around free.<br /><br />The mediocre, even the mundane everyday tasks for Libby seem almost insurmountable obstacles. Uncovering the truth will certainly be treacherous for her. She is a protagonist filled with bile that has been steeping her innards since the moment she ran stumbling out in the snow from the bloody house. Flynn's unvarnished character portrayal of the Day Family in the time leading up to the massacre, and through Libby's recollections is excruciatingly humble, and painful.<br /><br />It is a tale that exposes the vein of a poverty-stricken family hunkered down against the world. An air of malevolence surrounding them, like a storm ready to break. And then at times the rare glimpse into the soul: the mother Patty who is single-handedly trying to keep the family together and fed despite imminent foreclosure. A mother who will end up paying the ultimate price to save her family. Ben, the son who's spiraling down a sinister path from which there is no escape. Runner, the mean-spirited dead-beat dad who harasses the family. These are just a few of Flynn's crowning character achievements.<br /><br />All of these personalities and situations are a recipe for malignancy at their Kinnakee farm. Flynn is ruthless, and ferocious in her descriptions, as she is honest. Libby Day is not anyone's idea of a heroine, but she's persevering. Flynn places the reader on the same level as Day. The awkward journey of self-discovery is taken hand-in-hand. Just as easily as Libby slips the remnants of other peoples lives in her roomy kleptomaniac pockets, so do we. Perhaps someday too, we too can dig in those boxes under the stairs, expose the skeletons and stare them down without fear. Purge those dark places as well as Libby has compellingly done.pe for malignancy at their Kinnakee farm. Flynn is ruthless, and ferocious in her descriptions, as she is honest.

B0000844M8|5.0|I loved this movie when I watched it again many yesrs after loving it as a child.  It's heartwarming and worth owning!  Kudos to the Adamsons.  They are now my heros.

B00003CXAT|5.0|Jurassic Park rates five stars but only because that is full scale (I would award this movie 10 stars if I could)! Never have we seen anything like this fantastic film before. First off, with a great and seemingly plausible story by Michael Crichton, good casting and performances, and absolutely wonderful cutting edge CGI by ILM and the full scale creature effects of Stan Winston this movie will be very hard to ever top. The work that went into paleontology research, animal motion and design studies for the full scale dino work of Stan Winston made me feel like I now know what actual prehistoric animals look like in action.<br /><br />Most important was the basic story which was one of the best science fiction novels I have ever read. The author is reported to have discussed his cloning ideas with friends at MIT who were in agreement that the described approach seemed most plausible. I would expect the actual cloning of a mammoth to occur in our lifetime. Of course, only a Steven Spielberg and his great eye for composition, editing and direction could have pulled all the necessary talent together!  Hats off to Sam Neill and the entire cast for their great performances.  A movie experience this great only happens a couple of times in a movie goers lifetime.<br /><br />The documentary on the making of the film was also excellent and very informative, as well as the other extras provided on the DVD. Although many later new movies have incorporated credible dino CGI, the excellent detailmovies. This movie sets the new gold standard for state of the art CGI and full scale creature effects.

Boom Boom Pow was a sample of what great up-beat songs it has! even the love songs are up beat!<br />WARNING! Makes yhu dance! (P.S.: HAS POTENTIALLY MUCHO CURSING!)
B00009YOQW|5.0|We absolutely love this drum.  And everyone who sees it loves it to!  My hubby is a musician so he wanted to get this one for our son! It's so fun to play for everyone, plus it's very durable.  Great toy, Would Absolutely recommend it!!!
B000R4SMD6|4.0|Worth watching?  Absolutely.  A mind-twister?  Sure.  Does it stand up to the test of scrutiny? Nope.    (WARNING: This review is for viewers who have already seen the movie.)    The problem with a VERY clever movie, is that it attracts viewers who are determined to figure it out.  Therefore, the script-writer must be smarter and more careful than your average gum-snapping teen.    The big problems here are that our anti-hero plans every detail of \\"getting away with murder,\\" except a few MAJOR details.      The entire plan will not work unless the detective-lover-guy reacts to the murderer's callousness by leaping at him and wrestling him to the floor.  Without this, there can be no calculated switching of the same-make guns.  Get it?      Also, the entire plan will not work if his wife had AT ANY TIME told detective-lover-guy where she lived or her last name.  Ooops!  And what if he was off-duty, or not called to the scene, or another hotshot cop went in first.  Ooops, the whole plan fails.    (Just for fun, I'd love to know why the elaborate part was included, of murderer shooting through some windows.  ??? )    Worse than these gambles, is the HUGE and ridiculous linchpin problem of detective-lover-guy NEVER realizing that maybe, just maybe, since he has the EXACT same gun, and no one can find the actual murder weapon, that just maybe he should have his checked.  Once he does that, the whole plan is foiled, and hey, no need to blow your head off.    At the end, it was almost comical that our hero prosecutor's plan depended on murderer thinking they were alone (thus, no witnesses to hear the cliche confession).  Yet, as soon as prosecutor opens the door, the whole yard is swarming with cops, with their police radios doing their noisy cliche thing.  Come on, script-writer, stay clever and real to the end.  Don't get tired of being sharp.  Your viewers expected a full ride.      Aside from these jabs -- the acting, camera work, characters and pace were all excellent.  A few times, lines were spoken so softly I had to playback and turn up.  The blonde love-interest was interesting, but kind of dropped without tying it up for us.  Shoot, I thought we were going to find out she was the private investigator who sold her services to a rich murderer.    Hey, gimme that script before you hurt yourself!
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I love Depeche Mode and while there were a few good tracks and a few that sounded like their old stuff-the ones that were really good totally rocked! I love them no matter what they put out, it is all in their own style and it all sounds great!
0393312836|5.0|I thought this book was going to suck. Mainly because every time I would attempt to watch the movie I would fall asleep, and never even get past his time in jail. So I decided to try and read it, and it was great. I had the edition with the final chapter that was once edited out in the American versions, so there is a different ending for the book, which I think made me ultimately like the book more than the movie.    The language was a little hard to get through in the beginning but once you get a hang of the words it's a lot easier. Also if you go on Sparknotes.com they have a glossary of what all the words mean. But by that time, I had already figured them out for myself. I would recommend this book, but I would suggest reading it before watching the movie.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Everything's good about this film, man. The storyline leaves you hanging throughout, while still entertaining you immensely, and it reveals itself to be insanely clever right until the climactic ending.     The characters are very, very precise and likable, all of them entertaining to watch--people you'd want to be in a room with (or maybe not) for hours.     This film does require some listening and thinking while you're watching it. This isn't for people who want to be absolutely braindead for an hour and a half. It's not hard to really get into this movie, but you do need to really get into this movie to enjoy it. And you will enjoy it a lot.
076535618X|5.0|I almost put the first book in the series down, thinking it would be endless old person \\"got to pee\\" references. The characters were a little slow to build up an empathy with, but after the first few chapters things worked out. I'm really glad I didn't put it down.       Scalzi has done a superb job with the technology, both the space flight and the bioengineering. Both were plausible and the author knew when and how much to explain; it fit the narative seamlessly. Once the characters were developed, empathy kicked in like gangbusters. And in the tradition of Heinlein, just when things seem smooth, the crewman in the red jumper goes out to dump the trash and...       One thing I really appreciated in the Last Colony was the point of view of the other alien races in the Conclave. Scalzi has done some very sophisticated thinking about the interactions of humans and \\"alien\\" races.       These three books are well-crafted and well-paced. The author has constructed a very realistic universe socially, politically, and technologically. The aliens (species and individuals) are well thought out: the reader becomes invested in the plot and characters. The military   parts are realistic and not romanticized. The only complaint in this area is that the character of the Drill Sergeant (MSGT Ruiz) is a little over the top; if this is based on Sergeant Zim in Starship Troopers then it's not quite there.        Looking back on the experience, I see how the various story arcs and plot fit into the uber-plot and it's just amazing. I'm SO glad I didn't put it down in volume one.        Highly recommended.

B001EVPBY4|5.0|I loved Le Po&egrave;me Harmonique's DVD of \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\\" and it is a favourite of mine. So I couldn't wait to get their new recording of \\"Cadmus et Hermione\\". I paid $50 (Australian) for it and it was worth every cent.<br />The work is performed in 17th century costumes and candle light. The colours are rich and the protagonists all look superb. The entire production looks fantastic - like something out of one's imagination or a dream. The whole thing is as close to perfect as anyone could ever wish for.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, Andr&eacute; Morsch makes a very effective Cadmus and Claire Fefilliâtre is a beautiful looking and beautiful sounding Hermione. All the cast are excellent, in fact, and I have never seen so many pretty girls in any opera production before!<br />The orchestra of Le Po&egrave;me Harmonique includes:<br />8 dessus de violon<br />3 hautes-contre de violon<br />3 quintes de violon<br />5 basses de violon<br />2 violes de gambe<br />4 hautbois, flûtes<br />1 cornemuse<br />3 bassons<br />2 clavecins<br />2 th&eacute;orbes<br />1 percussions<br />1 trompette<br /><br />Lots of beautiful, colourful and sexy orchestral music comes from this ensemble. Maestro Dumestre gives us magic and lots of it!<br />I only hope Vincent Dumestre and his colleagues bring us many more similar productions of Lully's operas, which still remain, even today, largely unexplored.<br /><br />William Christie's Les Arts Florissants recent production of Lully's \\"Armide\\" is due to be released on DVD soon. I look forward to that one!<br /><br />However, do not waste a moment getting hold of \\"Cadmus et Hermione\\"! It is simply wonderful. Amazing and wonderful, and five stars aren't nearly enough!

B001GCUO16|1.0|i knew this movie was bad news from day one. i had no idea how bad it truly was till i saw it. not only did they ruin deadpool who has a huge following and is amazingly succesfull the way he was. bit given only 5 minutes of air time they screwed with cyclops for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />the cg is awful, the story sucks, and hugh jackman makes a terrible wolverine. his height, build, the way he carries himself and delivers a line, is so far off what wolverine should be i'm amazed by it everytime. i am a big fan of hugh jackman, i love his other films he's a tremendus actor so i'm more inclined to blame the director or a lack of preparation because as anyone who has picked up a comic book will tell you wolverine is an angry person. he's got a short temper and he rages out all the time. the impression i get from hugh jackman's wolverine is that logan is terrified. his actions are more motivated by fear and his voice reflects that which is just so wrong.<br /><br />everything about this movie is wrong...

0307266303|5.0|This was supposed to be a Father's Day gift for my ultrarunning husband. However, I was so hooked after deciding to preview the first couple of chapters, I replaced the cover with a cover from a book about relationships (hoping my husband would never pick it up for perusal)and hated to put Born to Run down.  While I do enjoy running, I am a 10 mile a week kind of girl, hardly an ultrarunner.  This book changed the way I view running and my diet.  It brings you back in touch with what your body is designed to do and has inspired me to run for sheer pleasure, and to fuel my body with good food. Even if you never run an ultra, you'll appreciate the information about shoes, training and diet and you will admire the spirit and culture of the Tarahumara (and the American ultrarunners as well!).  Wonderfully written!

0143034901|5.0|This is one of the few books I've read that I hope is made into a movie. It was a little confusing at points and I think a visual production would add a lot of clarity to this great story. The characters were endearing -  I would love to see who would play Daniel. Maybe Al Pachino as Fumero and that guy w/the huge nose from 'the piano' as Fermin (I think he won an oscar?)? At any rate, it's a great story and definitely worth reading.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|The prior to this movie, almost no-name actors, carried this poorly written adaptation of a VERY, VERY good book.  Staying with the actors for a minute, they are raw and fabulous; Frieda Pinto is beautiful and backs it up with pure talent; Dav Patel has superb range; and Madhur Mittel showed strong qualities.  I look forward to seeing each one of them in future roles.  They propelled this movie from a 1 star to 3 in my book.    The screen play is pure junk...yes it had all the fancy shots, and it makes you cringe one minute and smile the next...it has all the qualities every other cookie cutter movie needs to make it in a theater today.  I tried my hardest throughout the entire movie to be fair and ignore the fact that I actually read the book that supposedly inspired this cinematic garbage.  I know with certainty that if I had seen the movie without reading the book, I would have sat there on as many occasions and said WTF!!  \\"A 6 year old would really jump into an outhouse pit and run covered head to toe in human feces into a crowd of people to see his favorite actor?\\"  Sorry spoiler; but that's how the movie started and it didn't improve much from that point forward!     There were a few moments during the movie that I recognized the bastardized version of the book.  I am especially critical about the movie because while reading the book (Q&A) I looked forward to seeing the magical writing jump to life form on the big screen and it just didn't happen.  The characters plot and conclusion were all destroyed by the screenplay.  I've been disappointed by movie adaptations before but never like this.  You have to anticipate variations but this was atrocious.  One 5 star review of the book Q&A recommended seeing the movie to fill in the gaps of the book.  I highly...HIGHLY discourage that advice.  If you liked the movie, read the book and experience a legitimate and believable story with a soul.  If you are hoping to see \\"the book\\" acted out in a movie... steer clear!

B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|What a fantastic album, start to finish. Possibly the world's best (and certainly most underrated!) pop band takes off the gloves, goes back to the synth sound that made them global stars years ago, and takes back what Keane has tried to steal. The first single debuted high in Europe, entering the charts at #3 in some countries, and will definitely crack the top 10 in England - just like their album and lead single Analogue did 4 years ago. And once again, America will miss out. Blame radioplay. Blame poor marketing. Or just blame the unfortunate 80s label they've shed everywhere else but in the States. Buy it, listen to it, and love it. 10 stars.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Really, that is what they should have titled the movie.  I wonder how they could have found the clips they showed in previews, they were the only ones not using the most obscene language possible.  The preview make you want to see more of Stiller's spot on comedy, however, the cost was so great my psyche may never be the same.  On a bright note, Tom Cruise plays one of the most authentic roles I have ever scene him in.  Should he have a failed plastic surgery as he ages, this might be exactly what we see in 20-30 years.  I mean, come on, he already could not contain himself when he bagged his hottie pubescent now wife.
B000063DHL|4.0|Maiden's 6th release of the 1980s followed hot on the heels of both the critically and commercially successful \\"Powerslave\\" and the triumphant \\"Live After Death\\". The monumental World Slavery Tour had cemented them as the premier metal band in the world at this point. In comparison to its illustrious predecessors, Somewhere in Time arrived to mixed reviews and left certain areas of the rabid fan base somewhat confused upon its release in the Autumn of 1986.     There are two main facts you need to know regarding this album: firstly, Maiden incorporated synthesisers in to their sound for the first time in their recording history. This rankled with the hardcore metal heads at the time, leaving many old school fans shocked and confused. With over a couple of decades hindsight, *most* of them have now gotten over this fact, but it's still a debate over whether the synths actually added anything to Maiden's sound. In my personal opinion, the inclusion of synths gives a darker, futuristic palette, fully in keeping with the overall mood of the album. Added to this were complaints from some quarters that producer Martin Birch had taken his eye off the ball for the first time, and the production of the album was not as good as on Maiden's previous releases.     The second, and perhaps more important, fact that you need to be armed with, is that this album contains no songs by Bruce Dickinson. What transpired, is that Bruce had pushed for a more acoustic, mellow feeling for the album. Bruce's songs were deemed suitably un-Maiden and were rejected out-hand by Harris, Birch et al. Fortunately, stepping up to the plate was Maiden's axe-slinger Adrian Smith, who weighed in with three compositions of his own. The remainder of the album was penned by the ever reliable Steve Harris, with one co-writing credit for Dave Murray.     OK so what about the songs? Well, coming off the back of the World Slavery Tour, Maiden were clearly on top of their game in terms of playing, and this album is probably at least as technically proficient as \\"Powerslave\\", if not more so. Of the eight songs on offer, the stand outs probably all belong to Adrian Smith. \\"Wasted Years\\" and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" were both commercial hits for Maiden, and along with the third Adrian song, \\"Sea of Madness\\", tend to show a more melodic side to the band. The faithful need not have worried too much about these seemingly chart-bothering interests, as Steve Harris weighed in with some typical Maiden gallops. \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\", is often cited as a highlight of the album, blasting off with an ominous synth intro, before taking the listener on an out of control time machine trip with a satanic Doctor Who (I kid you not!). The solos in this song are particular stand outs. Steve also contributed \\"Heaven Can Wait\\", which seems written with live concerts in mind due to its crowd sing-along section. Indeed, it was a regular in Maiden's live set for over a decade, and still makes the odd appearence these days (memorably on their \\"Somewhere Back in Time\\" world tour). The response to Steve's other songs were mixed - Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner and Deja-vu are both typical Harris gallopers, which perhaps shows some lack of inspiration or fatigue in the band's writing (remember they had just completed an 18 month world tour!). The denouement, \\"Alexander The Great\\" pays tribute to one of history's greatest dictators by painstakingly listing everything he did. Ever. In chronological order. Depending on who you speak to this is either Maiden's unsung masterpiece or a failed attempt to recreate the glory of \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\". I tend towards the latter, but there's no denying that some of the music is very fine indeed.     No review of this album would be complete without mention of the cover art, which is perhaps the most intricate and well realised of all the Maiden artwork, containing hidden references to their past.     Indeed, the dark, futuristic artworkperfectly complements the overall sound and content of the album: time, time wasted, lost time ... those ominous booming synths. While this shouldn't be your first port of call as a new Maiden fan, and far from their most essential album, with hindsight, it stands well in the better half of Maiden albums. Would a Bruce Dickinson song or two have helped the album? It's hard to say. I don't think the world was ready for an acoustic Maiden in 1986, and Adrian Smith admirably filled the writing void left by Bruce. Maiden would go on to ever greater commercial success with their next release, and if nothing else, Somewhere in Time can be seen as a stepping stone for the band incorporating more technology in to their sound, for better or for worse.
0385340575|4.0|The usual Jack Reacher thriller.  Reacher butts into something on a New York City subway, and gets involved up to his neck in events involving city police, FBI, other federal agents, and evil people with motives that need to be determined.  And then there ia a mysterious file, recording an event in the past.  Everyone seems to want the file, and everyone seems to think that Reacher has it.  A dangerous situaltion that could get him killed.  Inconvenient people can be made to disappear, sometimes inconvenient because they may have talked to someone or seen someone who needs to cover their tracks.  It is a question of who is doing what to whom, and just who some people really are.<br /><br />Some parts of the plot may seem a little inconsistent or improbable, but it the usual fast action with Reacher in the middle.  He could be in trouble, but sometimes people just want problems to go away.
B001JFZ118|1.0|It's a shame to find that a great movie like Highlander hasn't been released to DVD in a descent format. I mean, if you want to keep the original aspect of the movie in video quality it's OK, but the fact that none of the 4 or 5 different DVD versions of this movie have spanish subtitles it's the worst thing I've ever seen. Even nowadays when almost all of the DVD versions have multiple language subs. I was thinking about getting the complete saga. But maybe that's not a good idea.
B002CAWNEM|5.0|Derek Charles is a hard working man, employed as a asset manager in a private company. He is very happy with his beautiful wife, Sharon, and only son, and because of his hard work he just got a huge promotion. But suddenly he gets a temporary worker who is both attractive and smart, and Derek is understandably impressed with her and also finds himself physically drawn to her. However, this new girl is desperate to get close to him at any cost. \\"Obsessed\\", is one of those movie I just couldn't resist seeing. Beyonce and Idris Elba are great.\\"Obsessed\\", is one of those movie I just couldn't resist seeing. I liked it and it's very entertaining.
B00006LPER|4.0|Haneke captains another efficacious look into the human psyche with this compelling drama. His vessel of choice this time around is Isabelle Huppert and his voyage takes us far out into unchartered waters where most other captains fear to sail. Haneke leaves port and allows the passengers to gain understanding and appreciation for his vessel. She is small yet highly respected amongst her peers. Despite being built under assumingly harsh conditions her exterior is tough and she is built for the icy waters she frequents. Once our captain has sufficiently displayed the outer of his vessel and gained our respect, he then takes us below deck for a rare exhibit of the ship's viscera. What we see is distressing and unpleasant, however Hanke's ship has sailed and we are now headed for turbulent waters.    Huppert gives a brilliant performance as the piano teacher. She beautifully executes both the character's controlled exterior as well as her hauntingly troublesome interior. Haneke's direction is focused and he delivers an unyielding character study that's potent and believable. This voyage is not for the weak of heart. Many will find the subject matter disturbing, and rightfully so, but it would be difficult to deny this masterfully created film the merit it deserves. I almost rated this film five stars instead of four, but I have difficultly giving the highest marks to a film I never plan to see a second time.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|Dominic Toretto, street racer-thief who's still wanted by both the law and some criminals he has crossed, decides to cut himself from everyone close to him including his girlfriend Letty. Later he learns Letty was killed in L.A. so he returns to find out what happened. Brian Conner, an undercover cop allowed Dom to escape instead of turning him in, now works for the FBI. He's been searching for a elusive drug dealer known as Braga. His trail leads him to the same man that Dom is looking for. It seems that Letty was working as a courier for Braga. When Braga searches for some new drivers, Dom and Brian put themselves forward. Dom wants to get to the man who killed Letty while Brian is looking for Braga. I already have the first two Fast & Furious movies and even The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All these movies are fantastic.

B001AEF6IQ|5.0|Torchwood, is as the product editorial says is a spin off of Doctor Who, but unlike most spin offs, you do not need to watch or follow Doctor Who to watch it as it is truly self-contained.    Torchwood is kind of like the the British version of X-Files, if it was created and aired by HBO.  Basically that means that there is a lot of stuff that has been touched on like same-sex relationships and romance to affairs, but at the same time never leaving the scope of the plot, so you are not bogged down by these scenes.  Every episode is basically contained with in themselves so the story lines does not really follow each episode.  There are the exceptions like with the two part episodes, or when they have to bring back something to help bring a story around.    Overall I will give this 10 out of 10 and can not wait for season 2 to come out on Blu-ray (Come-on BBC release Season 2 on Blu already).    I also would recommend that you watch this 10 episodes of Doctor Who, as it gives some more insight of Capt. Jack:    # The Empty Child (21 May 2005)  # The Doctor Dances (28 May 2005)  # Boom Town (4 June 2005)  # Bad Wolf (11 June 2005)  # The Parting of the Ways (18 June 2005)  # Utopia (16 June 2007)  # The Sound of Drums (23 June 2007)  # Last of the Time Lords (30 June 2007)  # The Stolen Earth (28 June 2008)  # Journey's End    And these episodes of Doctor Who to learn more about Torchwood:  # Tooth and Claw  # Army of Ghosts  # Doomsday
0375842209|5.0|This is such an amazing book, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed it. The setting was kind of foreign for me but that didn't distract from the enjoyment when I started to get into it. The story and character development were terrific, and I loved the poetic style it's written in. It was recommended to me by a friend who's in a book club and it was their monthly pick. They ALL in the group loved it and were filled with laughter and tears, so I decided I couldn't go wrong with it. I was right. This beautifully written story in a way reminded me so much of Anne Frank's diary and I suppose in some ways Liesel isn't so much different from Anne. This sad story will move you in a special way and it really is the best book I've read in awhile.
B00003CX8Y|4.0|The movie works great the only thing I notice is that a sign of a video camera pops up in the corner for most of the movie, so maybe the movie has trouble reading? It did not affect the movie, there were no pauses or skips but I cannot understand why this icon shows up.
0385341008|5.0|If you read \\"The Book Thief\\" then please read this book as well. I guarantee you will get the same level of enjoyment out of it and its similar in some ways too. This is about a group of booklovers under Nazi occupation and this story is all about how reading saves you body and soul. A new favorite of mine.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I purchased this recently in preparation for our trip to Disney.  Our Peg Perego is a great stroller, but the cup holder stinks.  It pops off and gets caught on things.  So, after looking at several options, I finally bought this stroller cup holder on Amazon.  It is great.  It fits our stroller perfectly.  We used it during our whole trip to Disney and my husband told me several times how glad he was that I had bought it.  We kept drinks for both of us in it (and they never tipped) and also my daughter's juice box in the large center compartment.  You can put snacks in there, keys, your phone, all sorts of stuff.  Also, you don't have to take it off when you close up your stroller; it just folds up and stays put.  I never had a problem with it trying to come off or not being supportive of the weight of our stuff.  Highly recommend it!
1439157383|3.0|From the minute I picked up this book I was completely caught up in the story.  It is a wonderfully written book about complex heart breaking issues.  I loved the book until the end. Which is why I only rated it three stars. When I finished it I threw it against the wall.  The ending is horrible and heartbreaking.  If you read it be prepared to be totally let down in the end.

B000002H70|5.0|After the success of 1987's Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, and the marriage of Robert Smith to long-time girlfriend Mary Poole, The Cure began work on their 8th album. It was obvious from the start what Robert wanted this album to be: a return to the dark side, so to speak, of their previous albums such as Faith & Pornography. The end result is Disintegration. Released in early May of 1989, Disintegration stands as The Cure's magnum opus, the culmination of all the directions the group had taken musically at that point.<br /><br />Disintegration is the second installment of the \\"Trilogy\\", picking up where 1982's Pornography left off. But where Pornography was dark and angry, Disintegration is dark, but also deals with loss and everything that goes with. This album is perfect from start to finish, from the opening of \\"Plainsong to closing \\"Untitled\\". But there are some major highlights, such as \\"Lovesong\\", which Robert wrote as a wedding present to his wife, \\"Pictures of You\\", \\"Fascination Street\\", and especially \\"The Same Deep Water as You\\".<br /><br />All in all, like I said, this album is perfect from start to finish, no weak points at all. I can honestly say that this album is not only the Best Cure album, but it's also THE GREATEST album ever made. Get this album if you don't get any other Cure album
B0019NG73G|5.0|The best movie protraying the War between the States.  Follows the book \\"Killer Angels\\" very well.  I saw this in theatres two times and own three copies of the DVD.  I wish it would come out on Blu Ray and/or directors cut with the missing scenes.    I also wish that a movie company would pick up the third book of the trilogy.  Seems like the story is not complete, however, this movie covers the events of July 1,2, and 3 of 1863.  Highly recommend for History/Civil War buffs.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|GET THIS DVD. There i said it. That's all you need. Yes you have to watch it from the beginning to get the full history of what's going on, but with people's faces dripping off their heads, dead guys running around in other people's minds, a latch jaw lady who will eat your spine, an electromagnetic man, and a guy who's emotions are so strong that you feel what he feels. what's not to love!?!?! Get this. It's only going to get better next season and you don't want to be trying to play catchup later this year.

0316096199|4.0|Alice Seabold's memoir \\"Lucky\\" ex-plores the process of going through and recovering from rape. In the book there is a large demonstration of drama. Given that the book begins with the actually rape, which was very dramatic, vulgar, and detailed. Then the rest of the book explains the dramatic process that she actually goes through after.   Another element this book demonstrates is a lot of self- discovery. After the rape took place Alice had to try and rediscover who she was seperate from the rape. All the sudden she just became the girl who got raped and she was struggling to seperate herself from that girl and tried to redefine herself all throughout the book.  Lastly Alice uses a lot of reflection/ musing. To discover who Alive was as a person she reflected a lot upon her childhood and certain memories that struck her as significent and then she'd talk about how in the present how it made her feel.  Reading this memoir really helped me with writting details and using short spurts to reflect on what was a huge impact on my life. I believe it to be an incredibly good book and definately worth reading. It's incredibly daring and always keeps you guessing. Even though the  the ending is very unfufilling. I still think it's a great book.
B00005JOHC|5.0|Was very happy I purchased this DVD.  I love the show, try not to miss any of the episodes, so when I found out I could buy them WOW!!!! Will definitely buy more.
B000P12LWY|4.0|The Costumes are gorgeous and ornate and lovely to look at.  Expensive production.  Not great actors or acting or plot.  ok for period piece.
B001W63DXC|4.0|...except for the fact that the songs fade out at the end of each song creating silence between songs.  This takes away from the live concert feel for me personally.  I would have given this recording a perfect score if they had simply cross-faded the songs so that there wouldn't be silence between tracks.  This would have made it feel more like a single concert (even though each track is recorded in a different country), which most folks prefer to preserve the feeling that you are actually at a concert.<br /><br />Other than this one issue, this is an unbelievably excellent recording.  The sound quality is perfect, the setlist is awesome, and the band performs flawlessly.  Highly recommended.  I also highly recommend the Blu Ray version if Flight 666.  It is one of the coolest Blu Ray releases ever!

B0020MKTOS|5.0|Few films have been able to translate an aspect that war can have on surviving veterans - that aspect being the embedded hate for 'the enemy' that dominates the world view of those who have had to fight in the battlefields, a hate that too easily translates into generalized racism that persists throughout the life of the veteran.  GRAN TORINO takes on this ugly issue and works it with such compelling force that just when the audience feels is cannot tolerate any more racial slurs a transformation takes place, opening a window to understanding and perhaps altering the poison of racism's effects on our American Family.<br /><br />GRAN TORINO as written by Nick Schenk and Dave Johanson and as produced, directed and acted by Clint Eastwood is not a film easy to hear or watch in its early portions.  Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is burying his wife, only to return to his long term home in a neighborhood that has become a sanctuary for Hmong people (an ethnic  group  from the mountain regions of Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Burma who supported US troops and were evacuated to the US after the Vietnam conflict).  Kowalski is a prejudiced bigot who loathes the presence of the (unnamable epithets) neighbors.  Next door is a family that includes a young loner boy Thao (Bee Vang) and his worldly sister Sue (Ahney Her) - two young people caught up in the Hmong world where the girls go to school and become employed and the boys go to jail.  Kowalski reluctantly befriends a gang threatened Thao and the neighborhood rewards him with endless gifts of flowers and food.  Gradually an event secures Kowalski's attachment to Thao and Kowalski grows to understand and respect 'the enemy' - people who are genuinely kind and loving despite Kowalski's personality and lonely bitter veteran's life.  The transformation of Walt Kowalski as played by Eastwood is genuinely touching and the way in which the movie ends is surprisingly sophisticated.<br /><br />There are moments in this bumpy script that are so trite and repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.  But it is to the credit of the cast and Eastwood's direction that eventually the repeated verbal slurs of racial hatred make the resolution of the film even more powerful.  There are many lessons to be learned by listening and watching this film, not the least of which is insight into the psyches of war veterans from all wars.  Grady Harp, June 09repetitive and stereotyped that the film becomes almost unwatchable.

1439138311|3.0|Colm Toibin's new novel, Brooklyn, presents the story of Eilis Lacey, who leaves the poor economy in Enniscorthy, Ireland, for the chance of a better life in Brooklyn. While many writers have presented stories like this in both fiction and non-fiction forms, Toibin does something special on the pages of Brooklyn. Toibin portrays Eilis in four major scenes: Enniscorthy, Brooklyn, Enniscorthy and her return to Brooklyn. In each part, Eilis strives to fit in and thrive, and she extends loyalty in many relationships. She's torn between Ireland and America and between personal relationships in both places. Her struggle strikes deep emotional cords that are recognizable, and never sentimental or superficial. I came to care deeply about Eilis and her struggles, and wanted her to find what would be right for her to bring happiness to her life. Toibin's writing is consistently fine: intense, descriptive, concise. If it is true that one can't go home again, how does one create a new home and not feel like a foreigner who pines for a real home? Toibin allows Eilis to grow and mature on the pages of Brooklyn, providing a chance for readers to reflect on what loyalty means and how finding the right people and places makes a world of difference.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
0753801728|5.0|For those of us who still grapple with the unfathomable question of the extent of man's inhumanity to man - whether that be past and/or present wars, hate crimes, racism, bigotry - this small novel is a stunning experience. Schlink has created at least two unforgetable characters in his tale of the coming of age of Michael Berg with an experienced woman of more years. How he evolves a beautifully honed description of sexual awakening into the nightmare of realization and then leads us to an understanding of all aspects of life civilized and uncivilized is a miracle of writing. A short tale, but one that lives on in the conscience long after the book's covers are closed. This is a genuinely brilliant novel. Share it with those meaningful to you.  Grady Harp
B002AT4K9Q|1.0|Terrible movies with a horrifically moronic econobox, fart cannon and park bench wing equipped fan-boy following.  These movies are just plain worthless and completely insulting to those with any hint of intelligence.
B00192IV0O|4.0|I don't often review music CD's but I really like this one, especially after seeing BEP perform some of the tracks on shows like Late Show with David Letterman and the Today show this launch week. My one recommendation for getting the most bang for your buck is to buy the red cover version at (the store with the red bullseye exclusively). This contains a bonus second CD and is available for the SAME price as the one-CD green version through June 13th. After that it's $4 more but that still might be a better value as it contains: Where Ya Wanna Go, Simple Little Melody, Mare, Don't Bring Me Down, Pump It Harder, Let's Get It Started, Shut the Phunk Up, That's the Joint, Another Weekend, & Don't Phunk Around. Some of these are supposed to be remixes (I haven't listened to this CD yet, as I wanted to get this review online so some of you could take advantage of that June 13th special) and it's an 'Enhanced CD' with an exclusive video piece of the BEP as well. Seems pretty worth it. Enjoy!
0385340575|2.0|I have read every book in the series, and this one is just not up to any kind of standard. I think the best word that comes to mind is BORING!! Lee!! We are used to action and suspense not a walking tour of New York.    Really...really..really disappointed.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Firstly, another Polish positive movie with another portayal of a tough, but deep down caring and always coming through in the end is [[ASIN:B00008979D Roommates]] with Julianne Moore, Peter Falke and D.B. Sweeney. Rocky in Roomates a little different than Walter Kowalski, but like Kowalski, is there for the good and protection of those they care about and need help.     Gran Torino is the most touching and moving masterpiece you will ever have the pleasure of viewing.     Gran Torino outgrossed, and left all the oscar nominated movies in the dust.    Walt, I mean Mr. Kowalski will win your heart and be your new true hero.    This movie, like [[ASIN:B00008979D Roommates]], reminds one of the way things used to be: more integrity, caring and credibility.    Incredible!!!

B0019HQIGS|5.0|It is an incredible concert. An unknown (to me) blues side of John Mayer. Over 2 hours of John Mayer acoustic, blues and rock. The recording is outstanding and with a good surround sound system you'll feel like you're there. Sound is great lights not at the same level. I loved every minute of it. If you got to read this review you'll probably love it too
0316017922|3.0|I waited to get this book - Loved Blink and Tipping Point... Read the first half and thought much of what he said was dead on... then we went into the NY Attorney fields... I muddled through that.. Having been a child of an immigrant myself.. I tried very hard to see similarities... but I have to say.. I know many outlier successes and some of what he said made sense but not all... then Gladwell goes into the \\"Southern Honor\\" bit and I have to say - he is dead wrong. When an author begins to reveal himself in non fiction work too much it ruins the book.  I had to stop reading.  There was no further use of reading his information I felt was incorrect at this point.  The Outliers in the end was a real disappointment.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in less than 24 hours. The titans have gained power and are ready to attack at the beginning od the book. I didn't like how many really good characters died though. I hope there is a book 6. I don't know what it would  e about. I guess the next profecy. They did make it sound like there would be more bookes though. Any way- loved the book.

B0000794F4|4.0|I heard one of the songs from this group while cruising through YouTube. The positive lyrics and the silky voice of the lead singer were terrific.  It was just what I was looking for to use in our American Cancer Society Relay For Life.<br /><br />The rest of the album included a couple more great songs for my purpose, and is one I'll listen to again and again.  Although, they all seem to blend together after a while.  Maybe putting them in with other groups is the best route.
B0000VAFNQ|5.0|I initially saw this movie on TV, and decided I wanted to buy it.  Also bought the sequels... I normally don't like scary movies, but this was more like an action, suspense, romeo and juliet love story.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Honestly the best book I have ever read. Jodi Picoult writes like no one else and only she could tell this story. Everyone should read this book. I have read it multiple times, and it gets better each time. Like I said, only Jodi Picoult could write this story. She brings the characters, the story, everything out so well. I can't even describe it. You just need to read it.
B0002EXH40|5.0|When Youthanasia first was released in 1994 it was a dark time for most any band that started in the 80s. Yet Megadeth went on to release what still is today one of my favorite albums and manages to exceed the Metallica Black album in overall consistency and quality of lyrics (They make sense) and overall sound quality. (I love the Black album, too) It is the rare occasion when a non greatest hits album can be listened to nonstop without cringing at even one of the songs. How many AC/DC albums have simply terrible songs sprinkled in between some of the greatest Hard Rock songs ever? AC/DC has only 2 albums as consistently good as Youthanasia and they are both the classics Highway to Hell and Back in Black.    The best songs are Youthanasia are Train of Consequences, Addicted to Chaos, Blood of Heroes, and Family Tree. There are so many good ones that your favorites are probably different. Hell, I like them all.    Family Tree is strangely the song that stands out the most to me as it deals with horrible incest but it takes on that topic with a great riff and the best one of the album. I guess it is near impossible to have a top 10 hit that deals with such a taboo topic.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I had to laugh when I rented this from Netflix not long ago and discovered even they had stocked a Korean import. The movie is shamefully \\"out of print\\" and as such this is the only way to get it. Most movies shelved in a distant back room and forgotten about by the studio aren't worth importing, but this one is.    \\"Firelight\\" is a movie that most people love for many reasons. I personally like the controversial plot that is established with the opening scene -- in which a beautiful young woman, Elisabeth, is questioned by an unseen gentlemen in order to be considered \\"worthy\\" of bearing his illegitimate child. The man, whose name we later learn is Charles, has lost his wife in a terrible horseback riding accident, leaving her comatose. He is for all intensive purposes, trapped, both by his libertine father's mounting debts and his inability to remarry, but his principles refuse to allow him to take a mistress, and so he wants a child to provide him with the love and affection the rest of his family cannot provide.     Their first encounter is \\"business\\" in which she remains cold and withdrawn and he is understandably shy and distant. But somewhere between their curious conversations over the three days spent on the coast, and their second and third encounter, something sparks between them. Elisabeth is driven by remorse that she can never see him again, nor experience this kind of love for real, and he too takes delight in her. Seven years later, she turns up on his doorstep wanting to act as a governess to their daughter, and it all unfolds from there.    Movies like this must be cautious or risk offending their audience -- and even as we might morally question the actions of the characters, the writer/director has done such a tremendous job that we are fond of them, fond enough to forgive and understand even their most shocking actions. Casual intimacy that turns out to be not-so-casual after all is not the only thing to raise your eyebrows, since also involvedis a murder... or a mercy killing, however you wish to look at it.     Everything about this production is exquisite. Gorgeous exterior shots, beautiful colors in the house contrasted with the bleak English countryside, lingering glances across lavish drawing rooms. The dialogue is marvelous, from his tentative observation that the light of the fire gives off more illumination than he expected to their passionate arguments. The performances are also flawless and have incredible chemistry. When they finally tenderly kiss, it is more erotic than most graphic love scenes. Which brings me to the love scenes... all things considered, they are not as graphic as one would expect. In fact, more movies would do well to learn something from them, because it is filmed as a union as much of mind as body, rather than one filled with explicit movement or moaning, and that, in my opinion, is what makes it so sexy.    I saw this many years ago and then recently, and had to purchase the import because I love it so much. So suspend your disbelief, forgive its few faults, and become enraptured with a \\"Jane Eyre\\"-esque Victorian Gothic Romance.

B001EO748M|5.0|This show is sooo great! And this season was just as good as the first, if not better. So much corruption, greed, and lust, what more can you ask for. If you loved the first season, buy this one for sure. Can't wait until season 3 comes out!
B001HN697M|4.0|Underworld Rise of the Lycans was actually a good movie.. It put alot of things in to prespective as to what started the hate between the vampire clans and the lycan clans.  Its a movie I will watch again.
B001IAO2QE|4.0|Many people told me this was an anti-democrat book or a pro-republican book.  They told me this book was all propaganda and would brainwash me.  I read this novel like any other and it was good.  Some characters bothered me, some scenes bothered me.  But it is Rand's novel, not mine, so I read on.    The people who told me this was Republican brainwashing material were really reaching.  Communism and Socialism were the enemy schools of thought in this book.  If you feel that those are the same as the democratic party, then yes, she condemns it.  The Fountainhead promotes individuality and self-worth, not any specific political party.    I didn't try to take this novel as a bible.  I am not going to try to interpret the philosophy into a style of life.  It was not life changing, but it was thought provoking.      Overall, I enjoyed this book.  Rand's writing style jumps from interesting situation to interesting situation, and as a result, I could not put it down.
1559408855|1.0|Salo one of the most over-hyped film I have ever seen.  I'm unsure as to what is supposed to be so shocking about this movie. It's a long, drawn out and boring version of a De Sade book. Read the book instead([[ASIN:0802130127 The 120 Days of Sodom and Other Writings]]), it's better and cheaper. I think the most shocking thing related to this film is the price people will pay to own this.  Salo is definitely a film that survives on it's, unwarranted, reputation. Avoid at all cost.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|Some very interesting theories in the Discussions Section on this film. Which is what prompted this review.<br /><br />Finally, for me at least, a cohesive and coherent Lynch film.<br /><br />**************SPOILER**************<br /><br />Detailed metaphors, symbols, and Mcguffins (or my lack of catching all the symbolism) aside, here's what I took away from this film upon my initial viewing: The film is simply about a woman forced to relive her brutal murder over and over again under the theory of eternal recurrence for her egotistical karma and harmful infidelities. (Eternal recurrence is an archaic and Nietzschean concept. Woody Allen made a joke about this theory in HANNAH AND HER SISTERS. \\"Great, now I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again.\\")<br /><br />Allow me to preface my theory about this film by saying: from what we have learned from ancient Eastern thought and physics, time is not a linear event. The concept of time is temporal and subjective. It is possible that multiple timelines may co-exist as a singular event. In \\"eternal recurrence,\\" the same existence or life is played out over and over again thru time. In Hindu religions it's expressed as the Wheel of Time. Nikki Grace is trapped by her karma or by The Karmic Wheel of Time. According to Eastern doctrines, we all are. Birth, death, and rebirth. Samsara. The only escape according to some Eastern philosophies is thru enlightenment, by paying for that karma (\\"a past-due bill\\"), or by altering it. Or, by some other Lynchean shift in consciousness. The Phantom, or Crimp, represents Nikki's \\"animus\\" (The masculine inner personality of a female in Jungian psychology.) or her evil karma. Nikki is warned of her Phantom personality or karma by the old gypsy woman at the beginning, \\"evil was born and followed the boy.\\" Only when Nikki finally kills the Phantom, or her adulterous evil twin, can she free herself from her eternal karma. Free herself from the endless cycle of birth and death. Become enlightened. The Crying Girl (credited as The Lost Girl) represents Nikki in her latest incarnation on The Karmic Wheel of Time, watching her karma and her numerous nightmare lives unfold on TV right before her eyes. The death of The Phantom, or the cleansing of her filthy karma, frees Nikki from the trappings of time and ego, while also freeing Nikki in her current incarnation as The Crying Girl. She has broken her evil karma which allows her, as The Crying Girl, to finally achieve marital bliss, children, and karmic happiness. By the end, Nikki has changed her karma. That's it, in a Lynchean nutshell.<br /><br />(During my second viewing of the film, I realized that Nikki initiates her evil karma in a past life by murdering her husband and his lover, for which she must suffer karmic payment for her own infidelities by being murdered in a similar fashion during future incarnations.)<br /><br />********************************<br /><br />Certainly valid, if one considers Lynch's adherence to Eastern Vedic thought, philosophy, and meditation. Lynch even quotes the Upanishads in the DVD extras.<br /><br />The Rabbits are the coolest concept Lynch has come up with in a very long time. Awesome and hypnotic. Like a Magritte painting. Mind blowing to say the least. Would love to see this flick on shrooms. To me, the Rabbits represent the karmic materialistic trappings of ego. Samsara. Or, eternal Hell on Earth. If only Lynch had had the temerity to linger on the static images of them for a much longer time in the film. They are macabre. (You can find some 6 to 8 minute episodes on YouTube. Unfortunately, they were not included on the Bonus Disc.) Everyone else's interpretation about this film and the Rabbits is wholly valid. What a cool flick. My hope is that, after spending more time with it, I may see it as a Masterpiece.<br /><br />Not being a fan of MD or LH by any means, I had given up on Lynch. (The only reason I rented IE is because I was intrigued by the trailer.) So,I have no idea how this narrative is applied to MD. In my opinion this is his best film since WAH and FWWM.<br /><br />Even though I understand the aesthetic that Lynch was going for with this piece, I only wish he would have used real film, maybe a better digital camera, or brought the film more into focus. I also wish he had used better ambient lighting in certain shots. This film was far too dark in places when it wasn't necessary. The soft dirty focus, vignetting, and fisheyed close-ups were a distraction at times, and played a large part in almost annihilating my full enjoyment of this film. IMO, this was an unnecessary device to exhibit Lynchean dreamtime. However, I may change my opinions about this after subsequent viewings. My theory is that the entire narrative takes place in dreamtime. (Parts of the film were too grounded in reality for dream narrative. I actually wish it had been a little bit more cryptic.) For the entire film to be in soft focus to simulate dreamtime, puts a very big demand upon a modern viewer. I feel that his use of music and his Lynchean set pieces are all that are ever needed to present his inner dreamworlds. However, it is his painting, not mine. (The scratchy phonograph needle that was used to represent one of Nikki's past lives was a nice touch.) I do love the raw grainy look of old film. It's like dragging a dry oil paint brush across a canvas so that the texture of the painting surface shows thru. But, I feel that it's very easy to get carried away with the newer medium of digital tape. Unfortunately, Lynch says he'll never use real film again. Too bad. :(<br /><br />Aside from being a dreamscape, comparisons to ERASERHEAD are baffling to me. This piece wasn't quite on the same level as ERASERHEAD (is anything?), but it is a very fine Lynch film, none the less. Past reviewers that complained about the \\"editorial sloppiness\\" are way off base about this film. IMO, every scene is crucial to the narrative. Nothing was extraneous. (As a matter of fact, I felt that a few scenes adding more clues about The Phantom were needed.) The film is ponderous at times for the average viewer, but the 3 hour running time moved by very quickly for me.<br /><br />All of the music cues Lynch utilized for this piece were excellent, including his own compositions. I'm especially partial to his ambient music and The Rabbits' theme. Most excellent.<br /><br />Everything you've heard is right on the money, Laura Dern IS truly amazing in this. A very giving performance. (In some of her scenes, she looks so much like her mother Diane Ladd, it's eerie.)<br /><br />INLAND EMPIRE indeed.<br /><br />The DVD extras are great. Over an hour of extra footage, most of which was not necessary to the narrative and was rightly cut. His interview is shorter than the one on the ERASERHEAD DVD, but he seemed more prepared and relaxed in this interview. I love his thoughts on music and the importance of proper theater and home theater equipment for the purpose of achieving the full intent of the artist's vision during playback. (One of my pet peeves are friends that insist on watching films on computer monitors.) Lynch goes off on people that watch films on computers and cell phones. He gets angry and very sad by the use of technology and its trend towards the \\"putrification\\" of this artform. (Lynch, I feel your pain, man.) Watching him work behind the scenes was very cool. Because his signature technique is mood, I've always had the feeling that Lynch was very meticulous and demanding in his direction to his actors, and it shows here. \\"Anyone need some Fixall?\\" Great stuff!<br /><br />Now, if we could just get Lynch to film a true biography on Francis Bacon, everything would be right with the world. Or, at least right with the Lynchean Universe.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />An ex-Lynchead that is intrigued by Lynch again.this is his best film since WAH and FWWM.

1439138311|4.0|Many books have come out about adapting to a new country, a new society.  Mostly they deal with an emigrant's difficulties and culminate in a reluctant acceptance to their new life situation.  This wonderful, gentle book shows what happens when, against Thomas Wolfe's dictum of \\"You Can't Go Home Again,\\" the heroine actually does go back to her roots.  Eilis is thus able to weigh the values and provisions of both places.  This is also a marvelous coming of age story, and by setting it in the relatively innocent 1950's, Toibin has given his character a strength even she was unaware of having.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This movie should be required viewing for everyone. Not enough superlatives. Watch it over and over....Every time you watch it you will find something new. Genius - funny - The entire cast is amazing.
0060254920|1.0|hoping the movie is better.  think the book was written for someone MUCH younger.  having had the most dangerous job in the world for 30 years, the book was a LITTLE slow.  if I meet an interesting young boy, I will give him the book.  the idea from [in] the book is mind opening.  for a kid anyway.  having been shot 12 times, my mind was already opened too far.
0783230079|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing, as is the entire cast. Wonderful, tender story. Can watch this over and over again.
0385340575|4.0|I am a sucker for the Reacher series and have been reading them in order since I saw the review for book 1, KILLING FLOOR, in People Magazine. I read this one as an audio book. The reader did a great job as usual and I think he really did a very good job with the pacing and story line.    You do not read these books to over analyze the plot or the story. I overlook Child's anti-USA slant. He is entitled to his opinion and he works it into each novel. You just go with the flow, escape, and see how Reacher will get out of this fix. Now.......when does the next one come out?
B001DE29SS|5.0|First, Robert Downey Jr is absolutely brilliant in this ; by far his best work. Second while somewhat based on Chaplin's autobiography , the film uses flashback sequences and the device of Chaplin dictating his book to a fictional editor/ghostwriter played by Anthony Hopkins to great effect.<br /><br />The clips from the original films are weaved into the story pretty seamlessly. Finally Chaplin's story is the story of Hollywood and the film industry.The scenes of the early days of Hollywood and and the glow of Los Angeles when it was a small town are fascinating to watch. It must have been quite a place and time.
B000C1ZXDG|5.0|I am a huge fan of A,S, Byatt's book of the same title. I felt the movie adaptation to be excellent.

Deffinitly one of the best rock albums in history period. Once again it pisses me off how all the one start reviews are done my simple minded little saps who nothing of the real art of music. Remember to pick this one up for sure!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is fantastic. It's super easy and I honestly felt the results after the first workout. It's like I had spent an hour and a half at the gym but really the workout was only twenty minutes. I hate workout videos cause I'm a clutz, but seriously I   am addicted to these workouts.
B001FB4W16|4.0|I really like this series and decided after it was first broadcast by HBO that it would be one of the first Blu-ray disc sets that I would buy.  I have mostly good things to say about it, from fine audio and crisp picture to a fascinating series.  But I have a problem with many of HBO's DVDs and now Blu-rays, which I find extremely user-UNfriendly.  Going back to the DVD set of the very first season of \\"Sex And The City\\" I was startled that viewers weren't given an easier way to jump from episode to episode on each disc.  We were forced to have to choose each episode individually and unable to avoid going BACK to the menu.  Nor could we skip the opening credits (and their annoying music) with a single click to the actual start of that episode.  There should have been a \\"play all\\" feature and easy movement from one episode to the next without having to go BACK to the menu to select the next one.  I regretted never writing HBO, because, to my horror, they did the same thing with seasons 2 and 3 and 4 (I stopped buying them at that point).  Unfortunately I found the same thing with the Blu-rays of \\"True Blood,\\" only even worse.  For example, the first 3 discs each had 2 episodes.  So when I got to the 4th disc  I ejected it after its second episode but then had to put it back in for episode 3.  Only I couldn't just go directly to 3 and was forced to go through the first episode, skipping tracks, but slowing down to play the entire closing credits so it would take me to the menu for the NEXT one -- if I fast forwarded through the closing credits, it took me BACK to the menu for the present episode and I'd have to start the fast forwarding for it all over again.  So I had to do that for the first 2 episodes until we FINALLY got to the 3rd, which was quite maddening.  If there is some trick to this that I missed, it wasn't readily evident, which is why I continue to feel that HBO seems to go out of their way to make their DVD and Blu-ray sets extremely user-UNfriendly.But I love \\"True Blood\\" and the Blu-rays look and sound wonderful!
031606792X|3.0|I'm a newcomer to the Twilight universe, based on a recent  \\"Guilty Pleasures\\" review on NPR.  I rented the movie first, and then ordered the books so I didn't have to wait to find out what happened.    I read the \\"Midnight Sun\\" draft online while the books were en route and I think that was my favorite piece of them all.  But as with any series, it's all about the outcome, which is why I wasn't inspired to review the first three books, yet this one evoked a lot more emotion.    In no particular order, here's what strikes me most...    1. Stephen King nailed it: Meyer's actual writing skills are pretty poor (and her editor and publisher should be flogged, too).  However, that wasn't as much a distraction in the first books, where the Edward/Bella storyline kept me hooked.  While things did get progressively weaker with each book, the drop in quality from \\"Eclipse\\" to \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is downright precipitous.    2. I don't have a problem with the happy ending - it's what I wanted.  In fact, a couple of chapters in, when the plot and writing were so eye-rollingly bad that I just wanted to throw the book against the wall, I skipped ahead to the end to make sure I would be rewarded for my time and effort.  That may be what kept me from having a 1-star experience.    3. Hated, hated, hated the baby plot.  It was so contrived that I half suspect it was in there simply to pound home the anti-abortion message.   And \\"Renesmee\\"?? Srsly??  It sounds like a feminine hygiene product.    4. As expected in a book for teens, the sex scenes were dismally unsatisfying.  Maybe the fact that Edward & Bella get to spend eternity having 10 hours of incredible sex nightly will spark something interesting on the adult fan fic sites ;)  Bella's preoccupation with sex is just plain bad writing - Meyer was too lazy/inept to find a real catalyst to move the story along.  Most disappointing is that readers were robbed of the one thing a vampire love story should provide: a scorching turning scene. Perhaps Meyer knew she just didn't have the talent to deliver on \\"it has to be Edward that turns me\\" anticipation that she'd built up, so turned to sensationalism instead.    5. I know a lot of the 1-star reviewers take issue with the fact that Bella gets it all, without giving up anything in return.  Sacrifice may have made for poignant and compelling literature, but -despite Meyer's influences - we are solidly in Harlequin Romance territory with this series, not the Austens (she - and we! - should be so lucky).   As someone who found my Edward at age 19 and is still dazzled 25 years later, I guess I'm more inclined to accept the absolute fairy tale-ness of it.  Sadly, she uses the marriage solely to justify the sex.  Nothing about growing as a couple, empowering each other,  just the same tired \\"love you adore you can't live without you\\", etc., ad nauseum.  Forget character development - all the main characters in this book actually DECLINE into utter blandness.  I had to watch the movie trailers a few times to recapture that palpable spark that the actors gave Edward and Bella on film - remind myself why I had cared about them in the first place.    6. The other hot-button issue seems to be Bella as a bad role model for the group's target audience of young girls.  Ultimately, like any media, if you're a parent allowing your child to read the book, it's up to you to address any themes or philosophies that you don't like.  It's Meyer's right to put it out there, it's your choice to read it.     Yes, all the loose ends were tied up and it's Edward+Bella 4EVER, but overall, the entire book is like the confrontation with the Volturi: anticlimatic, underwhelming, unfullfilling.
B001DZ9GRE|4.0|Delightful, comprehensive compilation with subtle re-workings that enhance and refresh the songs while maintaining their integrity (most notably in Cold and Little Bird - just different enough from the album and radio versions to be noticeable). Fantastic liner notes included with new reflections from the artist. Complete videography - without a \\"play all\\" feature which is my only suggestion for improvement (aside from offering a blu-ray version).  Just fantastic and well worth the purchase price.

B000001ESJ|5.0|This was the first studio album by Rush I ever got, and I recently replaced it on CD.  It's still awesome.  Rush's music sounds as fresh today as it did back then.  The complexity of their compositions and their musicianship are still breathtaking.  This album, A Farewell to Kings, is one of their most underrated albums.<br /><br />There are many great classic Rush tracks here, starting with two of their greatest epics, Xanadu and the blistering Cygnus X-1.  Xanadu runs 11 minutes or so, and is never boring.  I remember James Hetfield of Metallic saying that songs like Xanadu were a great inspiration for them, and made them want to write longer songs (many of Metallica's songs run between 7-8 minutes).  It's still a great song, with great lyrics by Peart and superb musicianship.  The song I like the most is the closer is Cygnus X-1.  The lyrics are really good, but the music is immensely complex, and the shifting rhythms and beautiful, understated use of synthesizers works amazingly well.  Peart's playing is especially good on this song.  For those who say Peart is overrated (some actually do) should be forced to listen to Cygnus over and over again.  The first third of the song is the best.  Closer to the Heart is a great single, one of Rush's best short songs.  The title song is also gorgeous, with a wonderful classical guitar introduction by Alex Lifeson.  The intro is so delicate, with the glockenspiel (a rarely used percussion instrument that needs to find a home again in rock).  Then when the song kicks in, it's quinessential Rush.<br /><br />Many critics never got Rush.  I remember Moving Pictures (another great Rush album) getting one star from Rolling Stone, while giving crap like The Who's It's Hard five stars (it's their worst album, though I've heard Endless Wire is worse).  Their fans got them, and are still getting them.  Rush rules.
0316036692|4.0|This is an interesting book with an intriguing subject: what are the hidden forces that cause those peculiar spikes outside of the bell curve? I enjoyed the author's views on the value of raw intelligence, the role of birthdays, the unconsciously held traditions of ancestors, the difference ten thousand hours of practice makes, the tragic story of the smartest man in America, who regrettably isn't the most successful, and finally Gladwell's own account of his improbable journey to prominence.. The book reminded me, in several ways, of \\"Freakonomics\\" by Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner. Both are written in a relaxed and informal style, both are wide-ranging and address an eclectic variety of subjects, and both suggest some non-obvious and very hard to resist causes and connections. I was disappointed that Gladwell Intriguing Outliersdidn't extend his description of populations with migratory herding traditions being confrontational and bellicose to the obvious--the Middle East.  Read it and see for yourself.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood gives us a multi-layered gem that some may find contrived and clich&eacute;d, but under the hood of this slick and powerful film lies an all too truthful look at what our world has become!<br /><br />The film is gripping from the opening credits to the very end and even though at times it seems a little heavy handed, it's blatant truth is really the film's genius. Apparently, Clint Eastwood can do no wrong, as I can't see anyone else getting away with this film. It's really a wonderful piece of work that speaks volumes about the world we live in.<br /><br />The film is full of wry wit and I laughed through much of this entertaining, but sad film. At times I couldn't help, but think of Dirty Harry and like the Duke in 'The Shootest' this film seems like a beautiful tribute to one of our most endeared actors. This film is not just a shinning classic muscle car, but a dark and deep drama that echoes the reality of our world today.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this \\"in your face\\" look at our sadly deteriorating society and also a film that doesn't apologize for using \\"politically incorrect\\" language. Of course we learn that you can't judge a book by it's cover and that stereotyping is unfair and wrong, but it's a part of society and it shouldn't be swept under the rug.<br /><br />I can only hope some spineless moron in charge of content for films released on DVD will not alter this film years from now.(Yes Disney I'm referring to you!)<br /><br />The DVD has a very good transfer, but the extras are disappointing on this single disc edition.

0316057908|4.0|Malcom Gladwell does a great job of discussing the pitfalls and powers of our instant perceptions.  His concept of gut feel and the \\"thin slice\\" reminds the reader that our instincts and our perceptions (particularly visual percepions) are powerful influencers on our behavior.  It is important to remember and understand our influencers and not allow them to disproportionally or irrationally impact our decision making processes.  A great book to better understand yourself, others, and the psychology of interaction.

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|This was a movie that takes you by surprise with its simple beauty. You won't find plot twists, intrigue or CGI effects. What you will find are unvarnished truths presented in the form of a simple tale. The acting is subtle and understated, and doesn't call attention to itself. These characters are real people dealing with everyday realities that we can all relate to or at least recognize. But the magic occurs when Eastwood's grouchy, slur-slinging bigot and his new Hmong neighbors manage, accidentally, to meet in the middle of an immense divide to find that, at bottom, they're more alike than either might have imagined. It is a testament to Eastwood's skilled direction that this unlikely friendship appears to form naturally and easily, never forced.    The final scene of redemption took me totally by surprise and is a sly commentary on Eastwood's many tough guy movies. Eastwood appears to be telling us that self-sacrifice and caring for others are the highest acts of courage, things which can never be found in the barrel of a gun.    This movie is elegiac testament to the directorial powers of a true master. The fact that it didn't get an Oscar says more about the Academy than this movie.

1567184855|5.0|This book was so interesting and really made you think about the purpose of our whole existence.  However, I was a little disappointed that it didn't bring Christ into the picture more.  It seemed to suggest that we just keep coming and learning, which we probably do.  But, how does Christ's atonement fit into the picture?  And what about the question of resurrection?  Christ was resurrected and there were also others around the time of His resurrection that also arose from the dead.  So, if the Bible is true, then we will also be resurrected, but into what body? Will it be the one of our choosing, or will it be the one we are in now?  This book has some great insights and I loved it, but it leaves questions unanswered in my mind.  There are way too many people who have seen Christ, talked to Him.  Christ does exist and He plays a very important role in our progress on the earth.  God, Christ's Father, is a perfect Being, and being perfect he created a system of justice and mercy.  Christ put that plan into effect.  The book doesn't go into how Christ and the plan of our own Salvation through Christ, fits into the scheme of things.  It doesn't seem like we can learn everything we need to learn in one lifetime, but I don't know if that thought necessarily makes the book the gospel truth either.  All we have is now, and we have to live our lives the best we can, based on the knowledge of good and evil that we have.  Christ's way is the true and best way, and we find that in the Bible and Book of Mormon, and other scriptures.  Perhaps we just need to be satisfied with knowing what we should do, and do it.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|Matthew Macfadyen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice movie was so good that I searched out his other movies.  When I received Little Dorrit in the mail, I sat up almost all night watching every episode.  I was not disappointed in his performance.  He endeared me to his character and made him human.  I enjoyed the whole cast of this movie. The characters were believable...they transported me back to the 1820's English period that Charles Dickens wrote about.  The sets and costumes were beautifully done.  Newcomer Claire Foy portrayed the lead character Little Dorrit supurbly.  I will be watching for other films where she has a part.  Andrew Davies can add another screenwriting success to his credit.  I wholeheartedly give this a 5-star success.

0385340575|5.0|I've been reading the \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels by Lee Child since the first one, Killing Floor, came out in paperback during the mid-nineties.  I've enjoyed most of them, some more than others, and I've always considered the Killing Floor to be the best of the pack.  That has changed with the publication of Gone Tomorrow.  This novel simply blew me away with its plot, characters, action, and multiple twists and turns.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  In fact, the book held me to the end, delivering everything that was promised.  This is the kind of novel that every author in the thriller genre dreams of writing.<br /><br />As for Gone Tomorrow, it opens with Jack Reacher in New York City, riding a subway train late at night, going to nowhere in particular.  He's minding his own business until he notices a lone female--Susan Mark--sitting several feet ahead of him.  He begins to watch her and soon realizes that she's displaying all the signals of a would-be terrorist, which makes him think that she might be intending to blow up the subway car.  Standing up, he approaches her and questions the bag she's holding, wondering if there's a bomb in it.  When he tells her to take out what's inside the bag, she pulls out a revolver and calmly shoots herself in the head.<br /><br />From the moment of Susan Mark's suicide, Reacher's life begins to change in ways he'd never anticipated, and he soon finds himself on a mission that involves a former Major in Delta Force, who's now running for the Senate, and a large group of Al Qaeda agents that are led by two women who enjoy torturing men and are experts in knife fighting.  While Reacher is trying to find the connection between the Major and the terrorist group, he'll have to stay one step ahead of the NYPD, the FBI, and the Department of Defense, all of whom want to see him locked up for a very long time for sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.  Reacher, however, can't be stopped.  He's a like a dog with a bone.  Once he learns the real reasons for Susan Mark's death and why the Al Qaeda group is attempting to sabotage the Major's run for the Senate, Reacher declares war with the intent of killing every terrorist in the group that he can find.  He's going to be their worse nightmare, and the ending is going to make the first Rambo movie look like a picnic at summer camp.<br /><br />There's no doubt in my mind that author, Lee Child, has created the best novel of his career.  The writing has never been sharper and the characters more vivid and the action more intense than in this book.  More importantly, I feel as if the character of Reacher is fighting for the American people (not the Government, but the actual people of this country) in an effort to get revenge against those who murdered so many innocent civilians in the 9/11attack.  Reacher does what we can't, or what our government has failed to do.  He takes on the bad guys on with extreme prejudice and has us cheering for him the whole way.  This is my kind of book!<br /><br />Though I'm no longer a collector of autographed novels, I'd love to get a signed copy of Gone Tomorrow.  This novel is a definite keeper...one I want permanently up on my bookshelf.  This is also a book Lee Child should be damn proud of.  He did what I thought was the impossible and finally wrote something that surpasses even his first novel.  If you're a fan of the \\"Jack Reacher\\" series, don't wait for the paperback to come out.  Run to the nearest store and buy the hardcover.  You won't be disappointed.  Highly recommended for pure summer enjoyment!learns the real reasons for Susan Mark's death and why the Al Qaeda group is attempting to sabotage the Major's run for the Senate, Reacher declares war with the intent of killing every terrorist in the group that he can find.

B00127RAJY|5.0|OK, so it's the typical scenario: have baby, gain weight, try to lose it. Only thing is this former gym brat can't go hang out for 1.5-2 hours when there is a baby demanding attention. Well, dad can watch baby for 25 minutes, just enough to complete this. I was skeptical that it would make a difference and I didn't have enough time for p90x. Well, 6 weeks later (2 weeks at every level), I'm almost 20lbs lighter and I tripped the other day because my formerly snug pants slipped off my waist!! I did have to diet to push the weight loss, I just had to chuck my excuses and I am simply thrilled.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I have enjoyed lots of TV series, but never one enough to buy it on DVD - until now.  If you haven't become a fan yet, be sure to tune in to the new season, beginning in a few days. And if you haven't read the Sookie Stackhouse books yet - you might want to check them out too.  Scary, sexy, imaginative - great entertainment.  Glad they made the first season available to buy - hope the subsequent seasons are also sold on DVD.  That way, I can watch Sookie, Bill, Eric, Sam, Tara and the others whenever I want to!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody Gardot's music is as haunting as her own story. Nearly killed in a hit-and-run accident at 19, she suffered aphasia, memory loss, hypersensitivity to light and sound and nerve damage. Her doctor encouraged her to try music therapy, and Melody penned her first songs, resulting in 2005's EP Some Lessons: The Bedroom Sessions, so named because they were recorded with Melody sitting in a wheelchair at the hospital. She played piano prior to her accident, but because of the nerve damage from her fractured pelvis, she couldn't sit at a piano, so she picked up a guitar.<br /><br />The same DJ that promoted a young Norah Jones also picked up Melody Gardot, and she was signed to Verve, resulting in her first album Worrisome Heart (which features one song off the EP, Some Lessons, the first song that Melody wrote after her accident). The album opens with the smoky, noir-drenched Worrisome Heart, with its blusey piano intro and snare brushes. The brass section adds punch, while the Harmon-muted trumpet adds a striking counterpart.<br /><br />All That I Need Is Love opens with guitar and clarinet, with whimsical lyrics and playful delivery that segues into some upbeat scat singing. Sweet Memories will draw the most comparisons to Norah Jones ([[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]]), with its soft blend of folksy acoustic guitar and Dobro guitar. Some Lessons tells Melody's difficult story; she said that she's refrained from performing it live because of the painful connotations. Quiet Fire has a dark, smoky vibe from the organ. One Day opens with the Harmon muted trumpet and the simple simplicity of guitar. Love Me Like a River Does may be the haunting showpiece that calls to mind Billie Holiday; the raw, wistful yearning with its undercurrent of piano. The playful, pouty bounce of Goodnight is addictive, with its scat and layered vocals. The album is short, though; it clocks in at less than 40 minutes, leaving you craving more (Melody's second album is [[ASIN:B001NESPHC My One and Only Thrill]]).<br /><br />If Film Noir could be condensed into a single package, it would be Worrisome Heart. This music would be amazing on its own, but is even more powerful for Melody's experiences recovering from a near-fatal accident and turning it into powerful jazz-infused tunes that showcase her smoky, mature voice. This is a must for fans of Norah Jones and Madeleine Peyroux, and classic jazz chanteuses like Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald.Thrill]]).

0810995212|5.0|[[VIDEOID:35341091]]I found out that this book is rather controversial after reading all the comments left by other readers on Amazon, most are disgusted by the historical inaccuracies and personal agenda of the authors. Even I have to agree to a certain extent. At the end of the book, you'll get the impression that Norman Rockwell, Leyendecker's competition, is nothing but vile. One reader even pointed out a knock-off painting that was mistaken as an original Leyendecker work. These are only two examples.<br /><br />In short, you should get this book for the art and not the text.<br /><br />Leyendecker's paintings is easily identifiable by the exaggerated, quick brushstroke effect, or crosshatched strokes with oil paint. The reason why I bought the book was to check out how he draws the folds on those clothes. His command of drawing clothes and drapery is masterly. His more iconic pieces would be the Arrow Collar Man, New Year babies, and the covers for Saturday Evening Post.<br /><br />Plenty of cover art he did for magazines are also included, although it's small at 9 per page. I thought the scans and reproduction of the paintings are pretty good. Yes, there might be yellow stains on those old copies of Saturday Evening Post but note that these paintings are from before the 1950s. The large illustrations are reproduced well, showing the texture of the medium. I like that his portraits are full of form and solidity, which I understand are drawn with models as reference.<br /><br />The included biography is controversial but I didn't really buy this book for the text.<br /><br />All said, it's still a very decent archive of Leyendecker's work.<br /><br />The art is good enough to warrant a 5-star rating, regardless of what is written.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

B002ASVYWS|5.0|Karnivool are back with a totally different album to their debut. Sound Awake lacks the riffs and hooks of Themata but expands on groove and melody and brings Karnivool's songwriting skills to the fore. This album is a slow burner that might take a few listens to get inside you but it will be worth it. The songs are epic and dark and the focus is on creating a mood that builds. The addition of many percussive elements is definitely enhancing these songs. Comparisons to Tool are inevitable but these guys are no clones. I can't deny that Themata's riffs and song structures are intense but Sound Awake is a different and equally engrossing experience from Karnivool. Highly recommended to fans of progressive rock.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This is a phenomenal WWII series, brilliantly written, produced, directed, and acted.  The music scores are also exceptional.  No matter how many times I watch the series, it's hard to digest and comprehend the brutality and pain of war.  There are triumphs too.  And this series puts you right there, making it easy to forget that you're sitting in a safe environment, not in a hellish war zone.  The series vividly depicts the bravery and sacrifice of WWII - and you'll learn (or renew) your appreciation for the men and women who fought for our freedom.  Anything more that I write in this review will only reiterate the countless positive reviews and ratings here on Amazon.  I originally purchased the DVD version a few years ago and immediately purchased the Blu-Ray version when it was released.  The Blu-Ray version is much better than expected.  Visuals and audio are excellent.  Start-up time is fast, and there are no aggravating previews or other advertising junk on the discs.  These are truly a timeless Blu-Ray collection.

Trying to keep soldiers alive led to<br />the later trench warfare of WWI.<br />Napoleon literally bleed France dry with his Russian war and all his conquests: all in the name of glory Empire in the Roman image.<br />I liked the movie and wish more such movies were made.
B00260HH3K|4.0|Justin Chatwin's bad preformance. His acting was really, really bad in many places, literally where he's saying a line just like this: \\"I...will...avenge...him...\\"     However, if that can be ignored, this is a near perfect adaptation of Dragonball. Despite many complaints about the Low (when did 40 mil become low budget?) budget of the movie, I don't really get it as I don't see the special effects to be any better than the really big budget movies (golden compass comes to mind).    And when it comes to the change of characters, I think for some reason people are just not getting it. Those who haven't ever watched Dragonball/Z/GT...I would've wanted to see this movie regardless of that. But for the fans who seem to the biggest bashers...I don't really get it. They haven't been really changed, just combined.    For an example, Goku is much more like Gohan later in the series. He is a teenager, doesn't really fit in school, but a girl likes him, etc. All of that is taken from that part of the story. ChiChi is like Chichi but in more ways like Gohan's girlfriend Videl, being a high school student, and being rich, etc, but still being pretty much the strongest woman alive. Yamcha hasn't been changed at all, save different hair color and outfit. Bulma has been made a stronger character, even though in the series she can be a very strong character, just a lot less mature. That is the biggest change in the movie there is.    Master Roshi, save the white beard, is the same. He is still a pervert at times and then an actual master of martial arts and a trainer at others.   Grandpa Gohan is actually given a part. Isn't that a good thing? And yes, I have seen \\"Kirate Kid,\\" and I do see the simiarilities of his part there. I do not see anything wrong with taking inspiration from that movie. Wouldn't any trainer who trained a teenage boy all seem like Mr. Miyagi (spelling) from Karate Kid?     I've even heard some people complain of why Piccolo was the villian. Ha; this is KingPiccolo, whom was originally a villian. And Mai was just an added bonus to make the movie more exciting. She's somewhat based on a woman who served a character who was like a smaller, not very strong villian. But that's not a big change, and she's put in leather instead of an army commando outfit. She gets the power to shapeshift. Whatever...    With all that said, the reason why they called it \\"Dragonball: Evolution\\" is because it is an evolution of the series, another form as was the change from Dragonball to Dragonball Z, and even then to GT. This is basically number four, and it's really good.    As for the movie itself, there are many things you wouldn't have really expected on screen. \\"SPOILER!\\" Oozaru is in the movie, also partially based on his GT form as well as his normal form. This is not a massive altering; it's combining elements from different parts.    DOing all of this makes the movie very suprising in many places. The acting otherwise is pretty good, like Chun Yo Fat as Master Roshi, and James Marsters as King Piccolo. Emmy Rossum is not the best, but still doesn't a decent job. The other lesser known actors and actresses also did an pretty good job.    There is also much dragonball searching, as well as several good battles, including the last one with Goku vs. Piccolo. All of them are good. There are some cool capsule corp vechicles, etc.    All in all, this is a very good adaptation. I would give it 10 stars if Justin Chatwin's acting wasn't so bad. He is terrible. If (or do) they make a sequel, he needs to be recast. I think starting there would make more fans happy.     So I push it down to 4 stars, though more like 4.5 because it is that well done (I for one am really happy they even made a movie based off the Dragonball Series)that it doesn't make the movie not worth seeing. I reccomend everyone buy this CD, and try to ignore Justin Chatwin's acting and enjoy how good the rest of the movie really is.
B001W63DXC|5.0|This double cd captures it all.  Every track was from another city, another country from the tour.  It brings everything full circle.  Having seen the band on one of the tour stops which is captured on this set, makes it extra special!  Bruce Dickinson and the band were in top form, proving that no matter what musical direction the charts dictate today, a great hard rocking band with one of the best front men will continue to dominate and will ensure their staying power for years to come!

It's still got merit as a suspenseful story that goes in directions you don't expect.<br /><br />I've only seen season 1, so I am hungry for more, Mr. Ball... I await your delivery!

I have a 1.1 player by design, as I have no intention of ever hooking anything in my HT up to the internet (it is completely closed circuit, and will remain that way).  BDLive is reserved for stuff like current trailer downloads, and community screening nonsense.  The stuff already on the disc, like commentaries and featurettes should play regardless of any internet connection.  This is merely Liongate's way of mining marketing information by tracking what features are viewed so they can sell me more crap.  It is also their way of insuring that they maintain control over when and where I watch it (if their server goes down, I'm out of luck).  This is the absolute last Lionsagte product I will ever buy until they wake up and realize that they do not maintain ownership of this disc after the purchase.
0385340575|5.0|Lee Child has found his groove again with his 13th Jack Reacher novel. The last one was marred by excessive voicing of Child's personal political views which offended many who did not share them. Thankfully, Child has not repeated that performance to any significant degree.<br /><br />  For those who haven't had the experience, Jack Reacher is a former U. S. Army officer, an MP so he has more than a bit of law enforcement experience. He chooses to have no fixed residence, but with his government pension and other assets, he has a steady and secure income, so he can wander the country at will. No family, no obligations. Just the ability to find trouble wherever he happens to be.<br /><br />  Reacher is a brilliant invention as a character. Motivated by merely a sense of right and wrong, he involves himself on behalf of the underdog - and wreaks violence on all who stand in his way. He doesn't have to be a \\"deep thinker\\", because Jack Reacher is all about action, page-turning action.<br /><br />  It is a simple formula and it works. Characters don't to have depth if the plots are complex and fast-moving and this is where Lee Child is nothing other than brilliant.<br /><br />  In \\"Gone Tomorrow\\", Child has Jack Reacher performing what is a basic act for tens of millions of people every day: riding aq subway.<br /><br />  It's late at night and Reacher is on the 6 train heading north in Manhattan. He doesn't quite know where he is going to get off, but that's his way. He has a few dollars in his pocket, an ATM card, an expired passport and a folding toothbrush. Reacher buys clothes when he needs them; he sleeps in cheap hotels and motels or by the side of the road or under on a bench. Jack Reacher is a wandering man.<br /><br />  Right now, though, he is on the 6 train in a car with five people. Reacher notices one of them a woman and Child comes in with the first of many plot twists. In his mind, Reacher starts going down a checklist of signals that a person may be a terrorist suicide bomber. The woman clicks on almost all of them. Reacher can simply get off the subway train and let what happens happen. But instead he approaches the woman and tries to talk her out of what he believes she is planning to do.<br /><br />  Surprise, the first of many: the woman draws a gun and points it at Reacher. Reacher keeps talking and the woman stops pointing the gun at Reacher and instead blows her brains out.<br /><br />  In a few pages, Child has introduced at least three plot twists and sucked the reader right in.<br /><br />  It doesn't stop here. Child introduces more twists and turns than you'll find on a mountain road - and he stays a step or two ahead of the reader most of the way.<br /><br />  In sum, this a thriller/police procedural and it is excellent, a genuine page turner.<br /><br />  There are a few negatives which really don't mar the story. Anyone with a knowledge of computers or information technology will shake with laughter at Child's depiction of the technology. Fortunately, though his errors leave holes a miles wide, they don't really take away from the story. In lesser hands, however, they would be showstoppers. Child does interject his political views again, but not as blatantly as in his last Reacher novel and nowhere near as offensively. And, finally, Child has this annoying habit of jimmying in sex scenes, generally with unlikely partners. Mercifully there is only one such sex scene in this book and it is brief.<br /><br />  There are thirteen books in the Reacher series and things have now reached the point where the series appear to have its own \\"A Reacher Novel\\" label. In many ways, Lee Child has simplified and streamlined the Jack Reacher character. Initially, Child probed Reacher's mind, coming up with motivations for the character's actions. Not any more. Just enough to justify the next plot twist - and frankly I like it that way.<br /><br />  Jack Reacher's simple morality, his clear concept of right and wrong, and Lee Child's devilish plotting - a thriller reader's paradise.<br /><br />Jerry

I ran across him while reading a book on the History of Opium.  Seems he wrote a book called \\"The Confessions of an Opium Eater\\" though I have yet to find it anywhere.    As for this book it is reported to be the \\"first\\" detective novel ever written.  It is very suspenseful, a real page turner, and hard to put down.  The whole plot is tight woven and keeps you on your feet.  You will come to love Marian and despise the Count but that is all I will tell of the story.

031606792X|1.0|Words escape me on this one....probably because Stephanie Meyers used all the words in the english language twelve times over in this book.  Way too long, on a story not worth telling.<br /><br />To me this sequel was a huge disappointment and tragically unfaithful to the original story and characters.  I don't even recognize these people, Bella and Edward who?  They have been sadistically transformed into characters with no redeeming qualities.  Qualities that they use to possess, that made us love them and their story.<br /><br />A profound, love story about two people that started out so wonderfully has become a convoluted catastrophe.  It stopped being about shy Bella,  the caretaker of a disbursed, dysfunctional family, unconditionally  loving an imperfect being, the vampire Edward.  It stopped being about their quest to be together through these impossible odds.  It became a dire, bleak and shallow concoction of a writer gone amuk.<br /><br />If Bella and Edward's love is true, then why bludgeon it to death in a murky swamp of superficialness?  I bought the book in hopes that the story would somehow return to its origins of integrity, but all I felt was betrayed and cheap for participating in the original characters demise.

159448385X|5.0|I misguidedly put this novel on the back burner because, while I liked The Kite Runner, I found the coincidences too difficult to take plausibly. With A Thousand Splendid Suns, however, Hosseini has come into his own as a writer and he has created what I can only call a perfect novel. This story had me enraptured from the first page to the last and not since Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone has a male author so authentically and genuinely captured the female heart and mind.<br />When I pick up a novel, I want to be moved, disturbed, touched, enlightened and educated. It is often asking too much, but this text delivers in a huge way and I will, without question, read this book again and again in future years. It is the best book I have read in about five years. Now, I wait with breathless anticipation for Hosseini to write another novel.<br />Simply put, I did not want this story to end. And when it did, I found myself a little saddened by it (though the novel is wholly satisfying). If you are on the fence about whether or not to read this book, make the choice to read it. A good book entertains, a great book shows us a way to view the world in a different light. A Thousand Splendid Suns is a great book--a phenomenal book. Period.

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This film, directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, is nothing short of a delightful gift to those of us who have loved Clint Eastwood through the years.  Here, he plays the role of a nasty old Korean War veteran who thinks like it's still the 1950s and is angry all the time.  His wife has just died, his two sons don't respect him and his granddaughter wears a belly ring and wants his vintage 1972 Gran Torino car which he, himself, assembled when he worked in a Ford plant many years before.  Also, a young-fresh faced Catholic priest keeps hounding him to go to confession.<br /><br />Clint lives alone in a neighborhood that is fast becoming multicultural and he hates his Hmong neighbors which he refers to as \\"gooks.\\"  But things change when he catches the teenager, Thao, from next door trying to steal his prized automobile.  The teen's sister, Sue, convinces Clint to let the boy work off his debt and soon a begrudging respect seems to soften Clint a little as he see how hard the boy works.<br /><br />The neighborhood is rife with gang warfare and drive-by shootings are common.  So is the constant recruitment of the gangs for new members and the Hmong gang wants Thao.  Clint starts to train Thao for a job in the construction industry so that he doesn't have to join the gang and this leads to some of the funniest scenes in the film as he tries to teach Thao to \\"act like a man\\" and throw ethnic insults at everyone.  Thao becomes his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and Clint becomes friendly with the Hmong family, especially when the women keep bringing him food.<br /><br />Soon, though there is a crisis and Clint, who we soon discover is probably dying, must prove himself as a hero.  I knew he would do something but was surprised at the complexity of the conclusion, which made the film work as a whole and ended in an extremely satisfying way.<br /><br />I loved this film.  I laughed out loud at times and also felt real emotion as Clint grows to accept the present world in which he lives and winds up emerging a hero.  I have nothing but accolades for this production although I know that some might cringe at the racist insults and find it a little too violent.  But that's what a Clint Eastwood film is about.have nothing but accolades for this production although I know that some might cringe at the racist insults and find it a little too violent.

0061150142|5.0|This is the second J. Picoult book I read and am very impressed with her writing.

B001WCBPCW|5.0|Kasabian are an English Electro-Indie band and it seems they saved their best (so far, at least) for album #3 \\"West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum\\". The album is a swirling richly layered Psychedelic affair with loads of chiming guitars, distorted effects and tight harmonies. Comprising a perfect dozen tracks, it has become a fast favourite of mine.<br /><br />Lead-off single (and their biggest UK hit to date at #3) \\"Fire\\" starts off a gently galloping ballad that could soundtrack some Western movie, before kicking into an incredibly catchy Oasis-style rocker with cascading harmonies and a faint Disco feel. Brilliant, and possibly their best song yet!<br /><br />Everything stands out really, from opening rocker \\"Underdog\\" (triumphant sounding stadium rocker with a blistering riff), the pulsing \\"Where did all the love go\\" (with a wall of Oo oo oos, a clap-filled chorus, and lyrics pondering \\"whatever happened to the youth of this generation?\\"), the brief instrumental \\"Swarfiga\\", the Lo Fi-sounding Garage rocker \\"Fast fuse\\" with crunchy guitars (The White Stripes would kill for this song), the wickedly catchy \\"Take aim\\" (theatrical intro, giving way to strummed and trilling guitars), and the pulverising bass/organ driven \\"Vlad the impaler\\" keeping the tempo up.<br /><br />For ballads, we have the Spagetti Western-sounding pair of \\"Thick as thieves\\" (think The Kinks) and \\"Western rider silver bullet\\" (a poem recital by actress Rosario Dawson introduces this song festooned with spacey and Oriental sounding effects), the retro, echoing \\"Ladies and gentlemen (roll the dice)\\", the haunting shuffle of \\"Secret Alphabets\\", and closing acoustic ballad \\"Happiness\\" where they come all Radiohead/Oasis-like (backed by nice swelling choir harmonies).<br /><br />Dressed like Napoleon on the album cover, and with swelling harmonies and cocky lyrics to match (\\"We are the last beatniks\\" from \\"Vlad the impaler\\") look for this to positively conquer.

B0018RWD1S|4.0|Her voice is by far better in range and quality than on Back in Black, I suspect because she was younger and had smoked less.  Cons - too many remakes of the same song from studio out-takes are provided and are of lower production quality.  Some versions take on a hip-hop quality that unfortunately detracts significantly from her soulful jazz singer image.  Lots of songs, whether you care for them or not, are provided on a second CD that's part of this set.
0743454537|5.0|I am not sure how I came upon J. Picoult's writing while browsing, but surely regret not stumbling on it sooner. And no debut could be better than My Sister's Keeper. The story line is all so rawl fresh, and real, but you could just imagine yourself in all of the character's shoes. I love the way she writes in first person always, but from the point of view of  each of them. Malkes it so difficult to choose who your favorite is and who to \\"cheer\\" for.  It is a sad story, there is no way to deny that, but Jodi makes it beautiful, full of feeling. The end is so surprising I could not see it coming, no matter what, which just made it better.  As a sister, a mother of 2 girls and a daughter myself, I loved seeing all the insights and how the story affected each character, how it spun out so nicely and natual. Hard not to get involved, and by the end, there is no way one can keep from being grateful for just living!

B000TXNK64|5.0|Now, I´ve always been very skeptical about so called reissues and so called original masters, because these products rarely show any signs of improved sound compared to the old records from way back then. Well, this one really stands out. I´ve played it alongside with my Lp from the 80´s and it sounds amazing.The clarity, and the attack from the instruments hit you right in the face, and the sound is groovy and fresh. This is more like it is supposed to be experienced, so it is worth it. No regrets,buy it and get Fandango too. ZZ Top never sounded better than on these great vinyl reissues.
B00164KYV4|2.0|This is not a chick flick.  It is not much of a romantic comedy, either, since it's not very romantic and it's certainly not very funny.  It is more excrutiating than anything else, and also not very believable.  I disliked almost all of the characters, with the exception of Jennifer Aniston's.  I could not believe how virtually all the women were portrayed as gullible, stupid, pathetically yearning for a guy, and, in Jennifer Connelly's case, irritatingly whiny and nagging.  And the men, of course, were equally unattractive--lying, philandering, acting like complete boors and slobs.  What a delightful movie.  Skip it.

B001FB4VZS|2.0|I'm in no way a casual viewer of this show but I'm approaching my review as if the reader has very little experience with Smallville.    If you have never seen the show you might enjoy Season Eight as you have no benchmarks established. I personally thought this season to be one big, huge let down. There were episodes that were flat out painful for me to watch, however, there were some good moments too.    If you are a Tom Welling fan as opposed to a Smallville fan I can strongly recommend this season over all others. Tom's just smokin' hot in Season Eight. Five Stars just on this point (shallow as it is).    If you are a fan of Allison Mack/Chloe Sullivan I would recommend this season with a lot of caution. Chloe experiences a lot of ups and downs. Chloe is the second most important character and like Clark, appears in every episode. She interacts mostly with Clark, Jimmy, and Davis. Do not expect sunshine and rainbows for her. The good is quite good and my purchase is exclusively for those good moments, but I'm not sure an average viewer would glean the same appreciation for those moments as I do. Two and a half stars for Chloe.    If you have been asked by your child to purchase this season and you think it's family safe, I would like to point out some things that might concern you. Although not too graphic, there is premarital sex on this show, even with Clark (no, just because he's suppose to be Superman doesn't mean he's held to a higher standard), the episode \\"Instinct\\" has some pretty lude sexual references that might be hard to explain to a younger mind, there is drug addiction, and there is a suicide attempt in the episode \\"Eternal\\". There is much playing around with Christian religious motiff. Those things might be important to you or you could care less. Three stars for family safe.    I am most definitely not a fan of Lois Lane. I would like to point out though that Lois appears in only twelve episodes, so if you're buying believing she's in every one,that's not true. No stars for Lois.    Lana Lang exits Smallville and Clark's life in a five episode arc. I can recommend this arc if you are a Lana fan. If you're not a Lana fan, you're not going to like it. No stars.    If you are a Lex fan, run and hide from this season as Lex makes only one appearance and that actor is not Michael Rosenbaum. If I could give negative stars, it would be for this sloppy tied up loose end. No stars.    To me $38 dollars is a lot of money to spend on something. I personally don't recommend anyone spend that sort of money unless you're 100% sure you'd be satisfied.  Buy with caution is my advice.    I'd give this three stars but the \\"Doomsday\\" finale forces my hand and I have to give it two.
B001N26GFC|2.0|I am a fan of Mike Leigh films and ran out to get this one as soon as it came out on DVD.  Unfortunately, Secrets and Lies or Vera Drake it isn't!      While Leigh's other films feature downtrodden people living depressing existances, this movie's main character, Poppy, is so annoyingly happy and giggly all the time, it doesn't come off as real at all.  For example, when her bike gets stolen, she's smiling and carefree.  When her driving instructor berates her and is flying into a rage, gales of giggling ensue.  She treats everything as a joke and can't keep her mouth shut for a second without laughing through basically every line she has in the film.  It just feels forced and completely fake.    Sadly, the only believable characters I found were the boy Poppy taught that was being abused at home, and the unstable, raging driving instructor.  The few and far between dramatic bits were the only realistic moments in it.    I'm quite surprised of the accolades this movie received, and that Sally Hawkins received a Golden Globe nomination for best actress as well.  Mike Leigh's films are very loosely scripted and the actors are encouraged to improvise their scenes.  This is done ably in his other films by vetran actresses such as Brenda Blethyn and Imelda Staunton, but I just felt that it was too big of a responsibility for Sally Hawkins and she failed miserably.

B001FOR5XU|5.0|As others have said, one of the great novellas of all time; I read it more than three decades ago, and always thought it would make a terrific movie - too bad they never made one to match the book.  As an aside, after reading it I always thought that Matheson's original intent was to title the book \\"I Am Legion,\\" based for those who are biblical on the story of a demon (demons) being cast into a herd of swine, who become mad and fling themselves into the sea.  The demon answers when asked its name \\"I am Legion, for we are many.\\"  My suspicions were, and still are, that some editor thought it was a misprint or that he/she could do better, and re-titled it \\"I Am Legend,\\" which makes absolutely no sense as a title for this story, other than the (I suspect) modified last words of the protagonist.  Perhaps someone can weigh in with the history...
B00171AEKW|5.0|The five stars are given to this book solely for its historical significance. Perusal of this vile classic allows one to clear up many misconceptions about Nazism. For instance, we sometimes hear that the German people came to support Hitler without ever understanding his positions. MEIN KAMPF lays this notion soundly to rest!<br /><br />Some commentators doubt if National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. It is therefore instructive that Hitler supported trade unions(pp. 874-876), at the time a socialist position.<br /><br />Traditional Christian theology, about Jews and deicide, is often blamed for the Holocaust. We learn instead that Hitler's pathological hatred of Jews had NOTHING to do with Christian theology. In fact, the only time that Hitler even touched on this issue was when he asserted that Jews crucified Christ for having opposed their commercialization of the Temple (p. 423).<br /><br />Indeed, Hitler saw Jews as a parasitic element that takes the hard-earned wealth of others. They did this through such things as becoming intermediaries in trade, and through usury (pp. 419-on). When the masses rebel against this exploitation (as through pogroms), the Jews ingratiate themselves to the rulers for protection. No matter how many times they are persecuted, Jews will always return to their ingrained exploitative ways (p. 427). Furthermore, Jews will, according to Hitler, resort to all forms of mendacity and slander in order to protect their privileged, exploitative positions. Such things as Jewish assimilation, philanthropy, and conversions to Christianity are nothing but disguises to further Jewish ends. Hitler was unfazed by the fact that the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION were inauthentic. To him, the Jewish reaction against this publication was itself proof of its authenticity (p. 424). Finally, whether themselves authentic or not, the PROTOCOLS were supposed to constitute a valid appraisal of Jewish attitudes and goals.<br /><br />Hitler unambiguously believed that only Germanic peoples invent things (pp. 397-398). The creativity of a society is directly proportional to the Germanic content of its stock and inversely proportional to the degree of \\"bastardization\\" with inferior races. The Fuhrer made countless racist statements against Slavs. Hitler repeatedly lamented the fact that the admixture of Jews and Slavs had polluted the Germanic element of his native Austria (e. g., pp. 138-140). The Fuhrer also contended that Slavs have no capability of self-government--their rulers must all be of Germanic origin (p. 951). Hitler was no white supremacist; he was a German supremacist par excellence!<br /><br />Proponents of Holocaust uniqueness sometimes claim that, whereas there was nothing that Jews could do to change their standing in the eyes of the Nazis, Poles could redeem themselves by undergoing Germanization. This is fallacious. Hitler said, \\"Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority.\\" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the \\"Germanization\\" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)<br /><br />We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of \\"resettlement\\" of Jews and Slavs. In time, \\"resettlement\\" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)y his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966).

B000002U9W|4.0|In the summer of 1991 my girlfriend and I were tasked with housesitting a friend's victorian just off Haight Ashbury. Since the house record collection had nothing but Van Morrison, we needed something to mix things up, so I went down to a little hole-in-the-wall record store on 24th and picked up copies of The Door's \\"The Soft Parade\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Atom Heart Mother.\\"<br /><br />Between deliveries from Escape From New York Pizza (and other random indulgences), we were pretty surprised by what we were hearing. The opening orchestral track - a lumbering, majestic creation still finding its feet like a dishevelled organ grinder awakening from a vicious bender - was ambitious, grandiose, and, at times, plodding.... but ultimately rewarding, as if it were the result of certain substances secreted into the punchbowl before the orchestra took the stage.<br /><br />I liked it then, I like it now. No matter that members of Pink Floyd have bashed this album from time to time; artists often distance themselves from youthful indiscretions, but Atom Heart Mother is a great album, and that includes the bookend-like suites that begin and end the performance. It's more like a tootsi-pop; you have to suck on the hard stuff a while to reach the chewy center.<br /><br />And what a center it is. Roger Water's \\"If,\\" a touching acoustic arpeggio to mental instability, is clearly a precursor to later songs like \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" The pleading rejoinder, \\"And if I go insane... would you please let me join in with the game,\\" is scary stuff, but when you think about it it's also pretty ironic, especially considering the fact that Waters was at the forefront of ousting Syd as the leader of Pink Floyd in the late 60's.<br /><br />But quibbling aside, the true majesty of AHM lies in Wright and Gilmour's contributions. \\"Summer of '68\\" is perhaps the finest thing Wright ever commited to vinyl. The swirling orchestrations echo the title track (and clue us in to the chief creative force on this record) but it's the lyrics that really stand out for me. After a whirlwind romance, the speaker feigns indifference as he prepares to leave, only to turn and ask how his lover feels about him. The complexity of the situation, rendered in such simple terms, never ceases to amaze me, and the chorus is perhaps one of the finest psychedelic interludes ever recorded.<br /><br />Then there's \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" the kind of song you wish could go on for another twenty minutes, (and for those of you with any knowledge of Swinging Pig Records and their amazing bootlegs, such dreams are possible). An ode to mortality and a simple love song to boot, there is something deceptively simple about \\"Fat Old Sun.\\" When I first heard it, it seemed little more than filler to me, but here, twenty years later, it's perhaps the most moving track on the record.<br /><br />A friend of mine once tried to summarize Pink Floyd in one word: loss. The reality of it, not to mention the attendant fears that seem to loom over everything we create, engage, or love in our lives. \\"Fat Old Sun,\\" to me at least, is preventative medicine for such sorrow. It's a song of heightened awareness, one avoiding lamentation by living acutely in the moment. And Gilmour's soloing only serves to echo those sentiments.<br /><br />And finally there's \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\\" I honestly don't know why people bash this song. It's fun, it's playful, and it's experimental, all of which suggests a cereal commercial gone wrong... or very right. The piano melody that weaves in and out of this song is, again, one of Richard Wright's joyful creations... and it's just plain delightful.<br /><br />Gotta have marmalade.ics that really stand out for me.

He replied that if he's in front 100% of the time, he feels obliged to engage with the audience, which causes him to miss what's going on around him. He then references Live Aid, specifically the end jam, where he was one of many on the stage, which gave him the opportunity to \\"dart to the back of the stage, next to the drums, and wail away.\\"    On this album, it is easy to see that Clapton and Winwood genuinely enjoy performing together, and Slowhand most certainly does \\"wail away.\\"    The single most significant track on the album, for me, is \\"Voodoo Chile.\\" While \\"Voodoo Child Slight Return\\" has been covered by many, including Stevie Ray Vaughan (who made it one of his signature concert performances), to my knowledge the only \\"cover\\" version of the 15-minute \\"Voodoo Chile\\" featuring major-league players is the Gov't Mule [[ASIN:B00004S3AR The Deepest End]] DVD performance with Jack Casady, who...like Winwood...performed on the Hendrix original.    \\"Voodoo Chile\\" magnificently reinstates the Traffic Winwood, the guy who quietly slipped into the studio to be a session player on [[ASIN:B000002P5U Electric Ladyland]]. He doesn't attempt to copy Jimi's vocals but does emulate the Muddy Waters menace that was so critical to the original track, and does the same with his swirling, whiplash organ flourishes.     \\"Voodoo Chile\\" falls into the range of \\"untouchable\\" Jimi songs, songs that haven't (and really shouldn't) be widely covered, like \\"Machine Gun.\\" Why? Simple. Jimi NAILED it, so the need to \\"reinvent\\" or \\"pay homage to\\" the track doesn't exist. BUT...in rare and notable exceptions, like Mule with Jack and Eric with Steve...the players have earned the right to step into those shoes for a minute, to say \\"Excuse me while Iplay my guitar,\\" and let 'er rip.    I know there are fans of Winwood's more mellow, \\"adult rock / album oriented radio / quiet storm\\" phase of his career and songs like \\"Back In The High Life,\\" but there is also a large crowd that has been waiting for the day when he'd throw DOWN again.    On this album, he throws down, with Clapton doing the same. Buy it.
B000QUUD60|5.0|For anyone who never saw elvis in person, you will really enjoy watching this 2 cd set.  I enjoyed the first cd better than the 2nd because it concentrated more on elvis and the concert whereas the 2nd cd had a lot of interviews with fans.
B001LF4IA6|5.0|This album is a the third installment in a trilogy starting with \\"The Rising\\", on to \\"Magic\\" and now the great \\"Working on a Dream\\"    This album really takes you places.. it transports your spirit to good feelings, hope and memories.  Wonderful mix between old and new. My only misgiving is Queen of the supermarket!     Last Carnival is a most special song, it is dedicated in honor of Danny Federici the deceased keyboardist of the E-Street Band, listen to it on YouTube, I can't listen to it enough times, so seamless and takes you in.    Other highlights: Wrestler, Life Itself, Outlaw Pete and the title song Working on a Dream    If you want to get an appreciation for this album search Youtube for Making of Working on a Dream      Hats off to the boss for this album
B00138H33U|2.0|I bought the cd because I loved \\"Hips Don't Lie\\", and I was hoping for the rest of the cd to be in the same vein-a good beat that you can dance to.  Timor and La Tortura are pretty good, but the rest of it is really bland pop-could have come from anybody.
B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson channels the best (and worst) of Charles Bronson to make TAKEN a riveting, chilling and unforgettable vigilante tale.  Retired from the CIA, his divorced-dad character knows all the dangers that lurk in the world. But he can't quite convince his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and 17-year-old daughter (Maggie Grace, last seen on Lost) to take his \\"worst-case scenario\\" fears seriously.  Until they all come true.  He's on the phone with his vacationing-in-Paris daughter when she is, indeed, taken by a violent gang of drug dealing sex slave traders.  This scene is handled with such a tragic, heart-stopping sense of reality that the viewer is primed to forgive Neeson anything in his quest to find her.  With just enough clues and former-CIA connections to speed his against-the-clock chase, Neeson blazes through Paris with a deadly focus and a brutal efficiency.  He's willing to use hands, guns and electricity to equally lethal effect.  And he's fortunate that he has what appears to be a force field around him that makes it impossible for the bad guys to shoot him, no matter how many thousands of bullets they fire.  Quibbles aside, we root for Neeson all the way as the film builds relentlessly to its satisfyingly cathartic conclusion.
0380715430|4.0|I love Bill Bryson, and this book was no disappointment.  There's not quite as much humor in it as in some of the others, but there are still plenty of laughs (one of my main motivations for reading his work).  The information in this book fascinated me.  Yes, it may not be the most authoritative work on the English language as some have said, but that's not why one reads Bill Bryson.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and will continue to read and reread his books.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|If this was a vinyl recording rather than a cd I would have to buy another copy because this one would be worn smooth. I was absolutey and pleasantly stunned when I first played this live 2 cd set. I personally don't believe Leonard Cohen as ever sounded better and the live recording it's self is, in my opinion, stunning. The nine backup performers are the icing on a cake to be savored forever. This recording has been well reviewed by others so I will add a recommendation for the dvd of this concert. The dvd is as visually and audibly stunning as the cd is audibly. Buy this cd and/or dvd and enjoy the concert.

0312330537|5.0|I have chosen this book for my reading group. I've read it before and loved it, but I'm anxious to hear what the others think of it. It is a great read, thanks to the author's obvious familiarity with many things I don't know about. Gregory David Roberts is a gifted writer. Wonderful, effortless descriptions seem to flow out of his pen. Sometimes he can be a bit purple. However, his lack of discipline is a small price to pay for the pleasure of his stories. The book, however, is not a novel, but rather The Excellent Adventures of Gregory David Roberts. I'm a writer, myself, but I wish I had the descriptive of this man. It's a keeper!
0061562408|5.0|I loved this book; it is beautifully written, beautifully thought out.  Anyone who has ever loved a dog or been loved by a dog will immediately identify with Enzo, an incredibly noble dog.  I cried, of course.  This book makes \\"Marley and Me\\" look like the cartoon it is.  Buy it!  Read it!  Love it!
B001KVZ6FM|4.0|When Carl was a little boy, he was fascinated with the daring explorer,  Charles Muntz.  Then he met Ellie, who shared Carl's passion for adventure.  They had a long and happy life together, but now that Carl is alone, he doesn't want to do anything but be a grump.  One day he meets a young scout named Russell and his life changes; maybe Carl has one more adventure in him, after all.<br /><br />I'd heard this animated film was touching, and sure enough, ten minutes into it, I was reaching for a tissue and sobbing.  The movie deals with love and loss, and adults who have experienced this may well get more out of the film than children will.  It's all about doing what you always wanted to do and it's very good.  Ed Asner provides the voice of the old codger Carl and I liked him more than I thought I would.  Christopher Plummer is the villain, who's not really very menacing at all.  The little boy, Russell, is a bit annoying in his helplessness and naivet&eacute;, but Dug, the dog is so adorable that I would see the movie again just for him.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" will leave you with a smile on your face and a lump in your throat.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|I was -like many other people- willing to like this movie, but it manages to disappoint consistently for all but its last 15 minutes.<br /><br />The cosmic reasons for Benjamin's backward aging are never explained (the clock at the train station is NOT an explanation - since one would rationally assume that several babies would have been born that same night in the city with the same condition as he). It is nothing more than a gimmick since neither existential issues nor insights are drawn from his surprisingly uninteresting life. The writing doesn't help much since when it tries to be deep or insightful that's precisely the impression it gives; that it is trying.<br /><br />The main acting talent in this movie is absolutly top-notch. Pitt delivers consistently and this movie was no exception. Taraji Henson is truthful (if a little restrained) and Cate Blanchett is without a doubt one of the best film actors of her generation. Yet, it is the vague movie direction by David Fincher (who was great in Zodiac) which wastes the talent in what could have been an epic movie.<br /><br />Characters move through the movie without clear motivations or objectives and often seem not to be affected by what happens to them. Button's obstinacy in loving Daisy should be the backbone of the movie, but when faced by the prospect of being a father while growing younger he leaves without considering alternatives, and Daisy doesn't even put up much of a fight! Parents would do anything to avoid their child's suffering, but why did Benjamin never consider that due to his own extraordinary circumstances, his child would just have to live an unusual life? Wouldn't his child be better served by having a mature parent for at least 11 years of her life than not having him at all? How many parents who die prematurely would not give anything to spend a little more time with their kids? These are not easy questions to answer but the movie doesn't bother to ask them, either.<br /><br />The movie spends a good amount of celluloid telling a story in the longest, most roundabout way possible. At first, still giving it a chance I focused more on the atmosphere being created, but there wasn't much there either. Benjamin joins a ship, has an affair and faces one battle in WWII and doesn't seemed changed by any of it, because he apparently thinks his life is less interesting than even we do. When he comes back home, the level of his joy at seeing Queenie (his \\"mom\\") would tell one he's been gone only a week and not a few years... at war! I blame this not on Pitt's or Henson's acting but on Fincher's direction. While one could make the concession that living in a home where people constantly died made Benjamin less willing to become attached to anyone, that would also mean that it makes the character less interesting, since apathy is not a quality one wishes to see in a main character.<br /><br />To boot, while the story of his life is being pieced together by diary entries (thus obviously from a first person perspective) when narrating how Daisy's accident came to end her dancing career; Benjamin momentarily develops an omniscient narrative; he knows every single detail of what led to it (one is left wondering why he didn't use that omniscience in preventing an eventual pregnancy that he apparently never wanted to happen). The narrative itself is interesting but it violates the premise the movie had already established.<br /><br />The bad choices made in this film are many but the final fifteen minutes almost make one say it makes up for them. The final scene of Benjamin's life, when Daisy narrates his final moments and the absolutly loving, heartbreaking way in which she covers the face of the dead baby Benjamin in her arms, is the most beautiful scene I have seen in any movie. She was being a mother to the man who once was her husband and Blancett nailed every single gesture and emotion when taking care of young Benjamin. Blanchett is amazing.<br /><br />The moviegoes on to tie Daisy's own passing to the Katrina disaster, which also destroys the clock (which never stopped running and is now relegated to a basement). A montage follows in which the people who touched Benjamin's life are seen doing what they did, but it doesn't seem to mean much and the viewer is thrown back into vagueness. One is left wondering, after almost three hours of watching, what was it exactly that The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wanted to say.saster, which also destroys the clock (which never stopped running and is now relegated to a basement).

B002ASVYWS|4.0|With this immensely anticipated second album 'Sound Awake', Karnivool have followed their brilliant debut album 'Thamata' with much more subtlety, dynamic range and depth. Comparisons between the two albums are going to be subjective to the individual as they are very different, yet Karnivool have succeeded to expand their musical territories with 'Sound Awake' while remaining true to what made them appealing in the first place: solid and engaging song writing. While 'Thamata' consists of songs that have more appeal straight off the first listen, 'Sound Awake' takes longer to warm to as there are more complexities going on within the arrangements with more shifts between heavy and delicate. This album confirms their status in the genre of progressive metal, which usually conjures an image of humorless academic musicians who excess in self indulgent excursions into sonic masturbation and a whole lot of piss weak song writing, however Karnivool keeps the onus on \\"the song comes first\\" theory. After hearing the album once, it is incredibly impressive but not as grabbing as 'Thamata' but on the second and third sitting, 'Sound Awake' stirs and stands up to be counted. Simply put, this is an album designed for multiple listens and with that carries the quality of longevity.    From a production perspective, 'Sound Awake' is world class as Forrester Savell (and Karnivool) has engineered an album that sounds superb. The clarity amongst instruments, even in the heaviest, crunching guitar driven passages of music is immaculate. Putting the mind-blowing performances aside, Savell has captured perfect tones of all the instruments that would make Karnivool's fellow counterparts either extremely impressed or envious. Having a great band is one thing but capturing their brilliance and making them sound THIS good is truly an impeccable contribution to the overall effect of this album. Hats off to Forrester Savell!    Jon Stockman's bass tone on the album's opener 'Simple Boy' is just brutal yet the gnarly overdrive doesn't erode the purity and weight of his low frequencies. Quite often it is Jon's bass that adds the heaviness of the crunching low end grooves where in most other heavy bands, it's purely the guitars. As impressive as Stockman is on 'Thamata', he outshines on 'Sound Wake' as he utilises the whole neck of his six string bass adding not just low-end power but so much to the overall melody of the album. There are bass players and then there are 3D sound sculptors and Stockman is the latter. Karnivool would be half the band without the talents Jon Stockman and 'Sound Awake' owes so many of it's qualities and appeal to his influence in it's sound.    Ian Kenny is probably what sets the band apart from other metal acts as he always approaches his vocals with melody and clever vocal phrasing regardless of how crushing or heavy the band get. He is always clear to articulate his words as he slips in and out of false setto without it sounding like some spineless vocalist from a late 80's hair band. Most of all, it is Kenny's ear for a hook that makes Karnivool's music so catchy and even though 'Sound Awake' isn't a hook fest, there are some lines, lyrics and phrases he delivers that hit the sweet spot to perfection. At times, Kenny slips into Tool's \\"Maynard Keenan Mode\\" with his choice of phrasing but it is not often enough that he doesn't hold up his own identity. Talking of Tool, some may consider that the band also flirt with Tool's sound at times on 'Sound Awake', (there is an undeniable familiarity in some sections) and this my draw some critics, however ultimately the band sound more like Karnivool than anything else.     Both guitarists Drew Goddard and Mark Hosking go to the next level to create the textures and sonic dialogue that is absent on most heavy albums. Masters of low end groove, both gits men can crank it heavy, hard and complex yet hold total ownership over delicate and subtle clean sections of music. A beautiful andspine tingling example of their guitar virtuosity can be felt in the last few minutes of the track 'The Caudal Lure' where the combination of staggered time signatures with rich, melodic picked chords on the lowest register of their drop tuned guitars creates what can be described as a holy musical moment. To add to this genius, the drums sound like it is played by a man with 8 limbs. The 'Man of the Match' on this album has to go to drummer Steve Judd. He kills it with the perfect combination of feel, technique and a rhythmic understanding of what services each song best. If you thought the drums on 'Thamata' couldn't be out done, check out what Mr. Judd does on the skins on this one!    The negatives are few and far between but ultimately for me, it comes down to the surprise factor of discovering Karnivool through 'Thamata'. The feeling you get from the first album of a band that blows you away cannot be revisited with the same intensity regardless of how good the follow up albums are. Other aspects of 'Sound Awake' that could be seen as negative is that virtually every song has vast dynamics i.e. loud to quiet, heavy into gentle into heavy or visa versa. Apart from maybe 'Goliath', there are no songs that completely rock out from start to finish. The CD sleeve booklet is fairly lame without any lyrics, photos of the band or artwork to give any incentive over the iTunes version. I must say, apart from the great cover image, the internals of the hard copy is somewhat disappointing...but hey, isn't it all about the music?! Well 'Sound Awake' certainly is.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Joker portrayed by Heath Ledger is done so well its chilling. The movie is great and all but Heath's joker is the highlight of the movie, hands down! I've watched thousands of movies and I've never experienced anything like this, his joker was just surreal, I'm just in awe of how amazing he done. Each time I watch The Dark Knight, I try to understand the character more and more, he is so sick, disturbing and demented its mind blowing. Heath will be missed and this role was memorable performance like no other. The movie is awesome all together, the way they tied the story together is cool, and Bale's performance is solid, I only wish that \\"the other villain\\" got to stick around longer, maybe get carried on to the next Batman movie.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is a remarkable movie. --Richard T. Jameson, taken from the product review<br /><br />If you are Clint Eastwood, you can make a movie how it should be made. As grand, iconoclastic Dirty Harry, Eastwood stood up for those who would make America better and stronger. As Walt Kowalski, he fiercely faces down a neighborhood gang and rescues young Thao, brother of Sue, his sassy new Hmong friend and neighbor.<br /><br />This is the point where Eastwood becomes Walt--racist, mouth filled with racial epithets spilled forthrightly on the objects of his racism. But it is not a purposeful racism, just one of habit and habitat. As with any meaningful exchange with those different from us, he begins to see that the Hmongs are people--and Americans, as he is, but in a different cultural context. It is actually liberating for Walt to make this connection (he doesn't have one with his sons and their families).<br /><br />My first thought after seeing this movie was disappointment mixed with respect. \\"Gran Torino\\" did not produce the thrill I expected, but instead delivers compassion and redemption and sacrifice, inestimable values in the big picture of Life. Ol' Walt had more in common with the priest's boss than first meets the eye.<br /><br />I wondered why Eastwood specifically chose Hmongs to be his neighbors (were they initially scripted in?). Developing genuine concern, compassion, and finally affection for his neighbors, Walt shows how Archie Bunker could have been 20 years down the road of American cultural dynamics.<br /><br />This, I thought, was Eastwood's purpose. America is changing; let's acknowledge it, accept it, and embrace this change. How my heart swelled with respect and fondness for this new icon--a Walt embracing his own mortality by acceptance and finally redemption.<br /><br />This is a remarkable movie--<br />Judy Polhemus.

It creates a movie in your head... the whole time you're seeing the story happen as you read. Now this book is NOT for the faint of heart. There`s no gore, but it does deal with some very disturbing subjects. People may find its dystopian depiction of society disturbing, but this is a brilliant social commentary of today's society.

0307341569|5.0|The opening lines in this novel grab you, introducing the main character as a mean, moral-less woman.  But quite quickly it's obvious that in fact Libby is not really mean- but depressed and down trodden.  Having survived a brutal attack on her family, Libby lived her life being shuffled from random family member to even more distant family member.  She profited off her status as an orphaned child, and now finds herself a broke 30-something.  Enter a group of murder fanatics, who give Libby money to personally question people from the past, and force her to challenge the truths from the past.<br /><br />The story moves between present day and the last 24 hours of Libby's family's lives.  It is clear that what Libby thought as a child was in fact not what really happened, and the possibilites of the truth are woven through the story.  Readers can figure out the truth, partially at least, before it's revealed.  And I can understand why others were disappointed in what was revealed, but I give this a 5 star review because the story moved along quickly and I enjoyed this dark tale of murder.
0765350386|4.0|When one of my good friends first loaned me Mistborn, I was skeptical. My father had read Elantris a year or so before and had not been blown away by Sanderson's ability, whatever the raving reviews had said for it. I've never read Elantris myself, but I have read a lot of fantasy over the years.<br /><br />I do not, however, think that this Mistborn trilogy, which I've had the pleasure of staying up to the nether hours of the morning reading, deserves to be lumped into that category of that 'Mediocre Fantasy' (such as the products of Goodkind and Brooks that Sanderson was so unfairly compared to) that has come to proliferate most of the market. In fact, the mere fact that I stayed up to the nether hours of the morning reading it, unable or unwilling to put it down, speaks volumes to Mistborn's merit.<br /><br />Among its most impressive qualities:<br />1. An intriguing and altogether bad*** magic system<br />2. Underground plots and treasonous schemes and political intrigue--all of which make for great fantasy, and for addicting reads.<br />3. An original setting that stretches beyond the typical medieval European models.<br />4. Fun characters and well-placed humor<br />5. A storyline and concept that one can care about<br />6. ORIGINALITY<br /><br />And thus, my initial skepticism about Sanderson's abilities wore off within the first 50 pages or so of reading. I found myself sucked into the world, thrilled by the novelty of it and loving the familiarity of a good fantasy, and thus I highly recommend Mistborn and its sequels to any fantasy lover (especially avid fantasy fans of the teen years, since Mistborn is (amazingly, for the genre) not filled with sex scenes and other vulgarities.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, at many moments in Mistborn, I had to grimace, almost as if in pain--not because anything was bad, necessarily, but because those moments could have been so much better than they were. I'd find myself thinking, \\"If only GRRM...\\" or, \\"If only Robin Hobb...\\" because Sanderson, as of yet, doesn't have quite that level of finesse, skill, and polish that make works such as A Song of Ice and Fire or The Tawny Man or The Belgariad sing.<br /><br />In particular, the characterization is not as strong as it could be. It's started and built on, but the characters never reach their full potential. They're not necessarily flat or 2D, but they don't have that walk-off-the-page quality.<br /><br />And the other main area in which the lack of finesse becomes apparent is in dialogue, where the characters speak more like people from our time and world than The Final Empire, where the story actually takes place. (I don't mean that they speak in our slang, just that they use modern English phrases, particularly in the banter, that seem rather out of place.)<br /><br />But to sum up: read it, enjoy yourself, pull Mistborn off the shelves to read over a year or so from now, but keep in mind that Sanderson is no fantasy grandmaster.

0380973839|5.0|I bought this recent edition of Ray Bradbury's \\"The Martian Chronicles\\" as a gift, having enjoyed my copy long ago. But I looked through it and found, comparing this to my older book, one story eliminated and two new ones added. So it was an education and extra bit of entertainment for me as well as the recipient. The \\"dates\\" of the various chronicles have been updated, too, since the older edition had us landing on Mars and setting up colonies in the 1990s. It's still a great read.
B001PJRAUS|1.0|I will admit that the idea of a modern girl going back in time sounded like a great story line. But \\"Lost in Austin\\" re-writes the story of pride and prejudice is poorly done. It starts off great and it seems wonderful, but slowly the script becomes messy and the story line is messed up. I tried to think of ways to fix the script and came up with a few improvements, but in the end the story line is weak and not enjoyable. I hate to say this but it kind of ruined pride and prejudice for me. Overall it's an okay movie. I would not recommend it for pride and prejudice fans. It almost came off as a mockery of pride and prejudice. The acting is a bit over done, but believable. The costumes are well enough and the locations are beautiful. The lighting is okay it could have been better in a few scenes. The director did a great job with the camera angles and the editing is fast past. Overall, I think most people will be happy with this movie. I was hoping for a more gentle version, such as the girl that would go back in time would be of the gentle type and would fit in more naturally, but than we would lose the comedy. I do believe that some pride and prejudice fans will find this movie enjoyable. That is they will like the oddities the movie shows and the odd plots twist and turns. But in my opinion i thought the script predictable and a little vulgar. I'm not trying to hurt anyones feelings.  If i was the script writer; I would focus the story line to be more comical and romantic. That no matter what the character would not interferer with the story of Dacey and Lizzy, but would add to it, by falling in love with another character within the story that could be introduced as a brother or a friend for example the cousin of Mr. Darcey.<br /><br />Please don't send me hate mail, because i didn't love this movie. I wanted to like it, but i couldn't because of how predictable it is. But I'm sure that many people will enjoy this movie sine it has a fun twist to it.<br /><br />Faithful Austin FanFan
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I heard about this show while I was traveling in St. Martins.  Ironically, a lot of the Caribbean island get American cable stations.  I don't get HBO so I patiently waited for this box set.  When I finally got my hands on it, I made the attempt to watch the series.  At the beginning, it was hard to watch because it seems like the producers didn't put any effort to train the actors in \\"Louisianaian\\" [sic] accent, but I was nit picking as usual.  I was not entertained by the character Jason's sexual escapades but again, not much of big deal.  The major annoyance for me was the actress Anna Paquin.  All through the episodes I kept thinking \\"Why her?  They couldn't find an up and coming actress that was willing to show her \\"muffins\\" on cable TV?\\"  I swear every time she opened her mouth, I just winced.  A close second was the actress that plays Tara.  Again why didn't they spring for a voice coach?      The story line seemed to drag on for the 1st 5 or 6 episodes till it got interesting.  It was the point where Sookie finds out the true nature of her boss and I finally stopped trying to take this show seriously (trust me on this).  To me, this show reminds me of a \\"novella\\".  All it needs is a midget and a couple of wizards and this show will earn a bright spot in my love for corny shows.
B000J4QWM2|5.0|Good movie. Not like the show though with Don Johnson. However, I sincerely enjoyed the movie.
B001IF252C|1.0|using this with a samsung 30t and on some days it snows over repeatedly, and i have to constantly unplug it and plug it back in to get it to get back to normal.  colleagues with the old Mac Pro with built-in DVI plugs are having no problems at all with the exact same monitor.    these little proprietary apple monitor plugs are lame.  even the iMacs have them... for what, to save space?
B001FB4W0W|5.0|This show can reach all different types of veiwers. With its edgy, suppense, love story, and vampires its a great show to watch!
1883217040|5.0|This is a very well written book. It is very easy to read and apply. Simple practical concepts that will definitely cause your level of playing to go up a notch. Great piece of work.
B001IHJ97E|4.0|In 1983, I saw this film on video tape. Time has not dulled the experience. It is a view of a very high tech modern world. It would be great if this type of technology existed in the real world. A great sci-fi film.
1569242739|5.0|i had a party and made about 40 of the low fat cupcakes, they're all gone. my friend who is anti-vegan ate 2. many people ate 4. BIG hit. tasted like the real thing. amazing. DELICIOUS. (p.s. i hate the taste of soy, but these were freaking awesome!) if you like cupcakes buy this book! i  am hooked!!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is quite simply one of Clint Eastwood's best acting jobs and the greatest movie of his career.
B000B8QG0O|4.0|My 2 year old daughter loves this movie! We bought it for her when we got tired of watching the first Toy Story. The movie itself is pretty good, but Jessi (cowgirl) is very aggrevating!
B000002C2E|5.0|Although rather depressing, this album is great!! The style and tone of the music creates an atmosphere that fits the lyrics perfectly. Dylan's vocals seem to be distant and the music is murky. I imagine the setting to be in a smoky dive bar with dim lights and a small stage for performances of slow wispy blues tunes.    The overall theme is about the frustrations of love and being trapped, torn and abandoned by love. The lyrics provide reflections and realizations of how tough love really is and questions if there is a way out of all the suffering.    \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" seems to be the only song that is somewhat positive. It is about fighting through rocky conditions with the support of love. \\"Mississippi\\" and \\"Red River Shore\\" are songs that were recorded during the same session but never made it on the album. These would make good additions to the album but at least they appear on Bootleg #8 along with other great outtakes.
0440237688|5.0|This review will not reiterate the plot of the book.  There are many others posted that do that very well.  In passing, though, the book was very reminiscent of a movie closer to my generation, called Logan's Run.  My grandson recently turned 13, and we took him out for ice cream on his birthday.  We asked him how his school work was going because for the past several years he has had many problems.  Among other things, he bores easily, doesn't connect with the learning process, and some subjects just come hard for him, all led to his being held back a year.<br /><br />To my surprise, he proceeded to describe The Giver to me, verbalizing the story in such a way, and without giving away the crucial parts, that I was intrigued enough to read it myself.  It was also apparent from his telling that he has made a connection to reading, thought about the implications of the story, and actually wants to read more books.  Even though I am 61, the book is written so that it captured my attention as well as my grandson's.  My husband will be reading it next.<br /><br />The author's treatment of serious subjects, such as sexuality, suicide, and social order, in my opinion, were not in the least way inappropriate or offensive for a teenager.  These are, at least so far, still aspects of life that should not be repressed in literature.  I highly recommend this book and am giving it to my other two teenaged grandchildren to read.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|BBC did an excellent job in creating this period drama. An excellent cast. Hard not to watch it all at once. Ranks right up there with the new version of Bleak House (Dickens). One complaint: should have cut the line where Macfadyen claims to be twice the age of Foy. Wasn't necessary for this version and is totally unbelievable.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood did it again. Another fine effort from the man that has given excitement in many of his movies. This times he tackles life in a neighborhood that has changed with new immigrants.During the movie you find his relationship with his family is rocky and his wife's priest interesting at times. It also features moments that Eastwood is known for...his stand for what is right against being double crossed and for standing up for friends. One of his lines in \\"Gran Torino\\" is \\"I'm not a hero\\"...to me Eastwood is a hero of good cinema fare! I enjoyed G.T.!
0060899220|5.0|I loved this book.  \\"Adventure\\" is an apt description.  Bourdain is bold -- arrogant about his successes and humble about his blunders.  He has a great vocabulary.  He is a great storyteller. He understands money, food and people -- and relishes their dysfunctions.  the book should be required reading for Psych 101, Management 101, and anyone thinking of starting a business -- or wanting an unpredictable, quirky read.
0792838068|5.0|I would hihgly recommend this video to anyone, especially if you happen to be a chronic alcoholic!    By the grace of God I quit drinking 5-1/2 years ago. However this movie shows precise details on how much an chronic alcoholic suffers, and what to do just to keep the shakes, convulsions, and seizures down and stay alive for the day. These are all things I have experienced personally and even not being able to eat. I used to watch this movie when I drank, and I occasionally watch it now, just to remember how the bondage of alcoholism becomes your medication for survival, even if one truly wants to quit.    There are just somethings that non-alcoholic's well never ever understand what drives us alcoholic's to drink. Many view alcoholic's as \\"they are doing it to themselfs etc..\\" To be honest with you, I don't know if it is inherited from family. All I do know is, when I had my very first beer at the age of 19 - It was like the remedy for my soul. From that point it just started to increase and takes the person over, even when we fight with everything we got, to stay functional and social drinkers when it can never happen, the alcohol will win and has a cold hard bed with a toe tag awaiting!     If you are a true alcoholic, this is a must buy! If you have loved one or a friend that has a bad alcohol problem, I would recommend buying this film for them. Personally I had spent over 60k in rehabs and admitted myself into the hospital for detox 17 times! - I really wanted to quit, truly I did, but there was nothing that mankind had to offer and it is not about will power in the fight for ending your alcoholic career.    Now I actually help others who are in bondage to alcoholism, and show them how I found the way true way out through Christ! You can find free help and visit choiceforchrist.com - No alcoholic is ever to far gone for recovery if they are still breathing!     This movie exploits the truth and pain as you see Nicolas Cage playing the role of this Acadamy Award Winning true story.
B001CDLATE|1.0|I love this movie but, from the first time I played it, my blu-ray copy skipped starting around 1:10 mins in. The disk does not appear to have any dirt or scratches and careful cleaning does not help. I suspected a hardware/firmware issue until I did a web search and found that many others are having identical issues. I am disappointed to have to return my copy. I am using an Oppo BDP-83 with the latest firmware.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|It's a companion piece to Mira Nair's \\"Salaam Bombay!\\" sucker-punch masterpiece, from so many years ago.    The slums of India are a human disaster, but humanity sputters for air wherever humans breathe. Poverty can claim the soul and hopes of some, but many continue to dream, and \\"Slumdog...\\" is a pipedream for a newly reawakened India. It's glorious, old-school, big-time filmmaking, and takes it's place in the 21st century zeitgeist of a country daring to dream bigger than it has in a long, long time. An India that can be India while also being something transnational.    The story of rags to riches is classic narrative, but done with a pulsing sound and camera that doesn't patronize a country and people. I would've preferred Jamal to be a prodigy whose tea-boy opportunity in the New India's IT industry opens a path to making it big. Instead the films opts for a story of flukes and coincidences that give our hero the right answers at the right time. Still, the power of this movie's heart is undeniable. Danny Boyle's craft with telling a global story in a local tongue (and let's put credit out there for the overlooked Loveleen Tandan); Rahman and MIA's drive to lift us off the ground with a roar of sound and a kick in the pants; Dev Patel and Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal's Bollywood-free delivery... it all adds up to make for great movie-making.    \\"Salaam Bombay!\\" showed the breaking of a human spirit in the crush of the slum. But sometimes, a few daredevils might find a way to get away. Look down on that outdoor latrine, realize what you gotta do to make it happen, scream and take your plunge. For those who get real lucky, maybe they'll even find love and a masala dance number at the end of it. You can hope, right?
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Let me say I agree with others. Let me cover the bad in detail. The good is simple: high quality transfers, excellent and respectful remastered effects. Some decent though not world shaking special features.    So the bad.    1. The DVDs are packaged without labels. So it is virtually impossible to know what is on each disc without checking the index cards, which are packaged separately.     2. Confusing packaging: The DVDs have HD-DVD on side 1 and standard DVD on side 2 for Season 1. Season 2 and 3 have standard DVD only, on side 1.    3. Bad packaging: An extremely slim line packaging, with poor construction means it is very easy to damage your discs, place them in the wrong location, or RECEIVE THEM SCRATCHED.    4. Disrespectful packaging: All in all this is packaged as if it were a budget release, not one of the most profitable and beloved franchises of all time. For shame!    Since this is TOS, the greatness of the series outweighs these flaws, but I would strongly urge purchasers to TEST every disc within the limits allowed for warranties, so returns can be done within that time.    Option to avoid purchasing: CBS.com as of the date of this review has all of these available for free streaming viewing, though not all of them with remastered effects, and with annoying interstitial commercials strewn thereof. Nonetheless, for noncompletists, this may well be sufficient.    I give 5 STARS to TOS, 3 stars to the features, 1 star to the packaging. All in all 4 stars, though if I could, I'd give 3.5.

B000RIWAYY|4.0|For starters, I've purchased this album 4 times.  Cassette in high school.  CD in early 90's when I bought a CD player.  Remastered version when that became available.  Now the Deluxe version comes out with a concert.      Imagine if all of our favorite artists released a concert DVD from early in their career, with a definitive album like this.  The DVD is great--filmed at the same hostile venue that booed Stevie Ray Vaughn just a few years earlier.  Great setlist.  A lot of great rarities here.  Hordes of Locusts and Memories, from  Dreaming # 11.  Solid setlist, solid performances.  Worth the price all by itself.    Surfing With the Alien was early in Joe's career.  Some of his best work.  I look at his setlists and evaluate their content based on whether they contain songs like Ice 9, Circles, and Midnight.  This album is great from start to finish.    I love Joe's collective work--there is an evolution there, with the songs from this album serving as \\"tent posts\\".  Possibly my favorite is \\"Crushing Day\\".  This is a song that he doesn't perform much live, but is truly a great guitar performance.  His later works, show more depth and textures--this one is a great workout album.  It shows off his guitar talent.    These songs are compact, awesome examples of Joe's capabilities.  This is a must. I've also always admired the album art. Not many musicians pull in comic book artists.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Great picture quality, the added special effects were  MUCH better than the original and blended seemlessly, did not detract from the story but seemed as though they were part of the original.  No doubt the intent and they succeeded.  Seen many but not all of the episodes, first chance to see all of the first season and many episodes were completely new to me and thus a pleasure.  You can see the birth of the Federation as the plot lines develop and they create beloved aliens and and the framework for the Mythos of the Federation.  The friendship between Kirk, Bones and Spock blossoms and by the end of the season almost all of the characters are fully developed. Alot of love went into this release and it shows.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Within Temptation's The Silent Force is a very good buy. All of the songs that are on this CD are very good. No boring songs, unless you're not into them of course.
B001HN697M|1.0|Sure it tells the story and leads into the first movie, but it lacks any of action in either of the first two movies.  It was done more like a documentary, instead of a movie.
B001BRJZPW|3.0|This is a good buy for someone who's looking for all of these movies that aren't in Blu-Ray format. I would be aware of the shipping, however. When these DVDs came to me, one of the covers of the movies was kinda banged up, but the DVD itself was in perfect condition.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I never laughted so hard in my life watching a moive like this one.Ben Stiller,Robert Downey Jr,and especially Tom Cruise are great.Cruise should have been nomanated along with Dowey Jr. for best supporting actor.He took a hell of a gamble,and it payed off.  \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is on my list of the BEST comedies of all time.
031606792X|3.0|I read a few reviews good and bad. And I have to say I agree with both sides. So I'll sit right here in the middle.  Breaking dawn was a pretty good book. But it was not in the same league as the other three.  Looking at it by itself yeah it was good. I read it in two days just like the others.  But because it is attached to characters that has captivated millions of readers it is subject to the prejudices and bias of its audience.<br /><br />For Instance...<br /><br />I love Jacob. So I found imprinting on Renesmee and the whole tail as a collar thing degrading. I would have been happier if he could have imprinted on Leah.  And then Meyer's still can't give him love outright because he's gonna have to fight with some Hybrid from the Amazon. Sorry, I get touchy. Yes I know it's a story, I know its fantasy. But Meyer's is that good to make it real for so many of us.<br /><br />Secondly...<br /><br />I know Meyer's is religious and apparently adamant about her beliefs, but I still wanted a fight at the end.  Why spend one-fourth of this book building to a fight that doesn't happen. Bella could have at least tried to knock Jane backwards with her force field.  They didn't have to die. Just rough em up a bit.<br /><br />Thirdly...<br /><br />Bella kind of sucks. Everyone is like she was whiny before but I think it was amplified to a new level in this book. She started getting on my nerves in Eclipse and for me it soars to new heights in this book.  I just don't like the way she treats everybody.<br /><br />and Ahhh Renesmee...<br /><br />I like Renesmee okay. She had some cute parts. But for the most part I was ... scared. I'm sorry. She's breaking bones. She biting dying mom at birth. She's biting Jacob.  She's talking to Edward in the womb. She's speaking complete sentences in a week.  She's just scary.  The cuteness makes it worst. The name doesn't help.<br /><br />My feelings for imprinting on infants and toddlers would take seven reviews to explain adequately. I tried Stephenie, but it's still an uncomfortable...no.<br /><br />Folks, the good parts were great... The wedding, the Isle of Esme (until the rancid chicken), Jake's part (minus steel cables).<br /><br />I liked the happy in between, with Charlie and Sue, and Jacob's pack.<br /><br />It was cool to see Bella becoming a Vampire.  It was cool when she was learning to control her power.  It was even cool in the fight scene when she was rocking it out. I really liked all the covens and their powers.<br /><br />But...its still there, the disappointment. I'm like a vegetarian Vampire. I'm not completely satisfied. Can you honestly say you are?<br /><br />For the one stars, I guess it's just our expectations and desires being rejected that makes this book the way it is.  For the five stars, yes fairy tales do end with an happy ending. But it didn't seem happy for me. It was condescending. Yes, it is just a book.  Yes we should get over ourselves but sadly I can't.  Team Jacob forever.ood parts were great... The wedding, the Isle of Esme (until the rancid chicken), Jake's part (minus steel cables).

0312330537|4.0|I loved this book. For a while I've been reading a lot of fluffy romance and general fiction so it was great to jump into something with a little more depth. This book really taught me a lot about India and its culture which is nice - I like books that teach you something.<br /><br />This book is a little on the long side and the plot jumps up and down with about ten climaxs rather than one. I liked the first half of the book better than the second - but overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others.
0393061310|5.0|A wonderfully insightful book. Diamond is brilliant in explaining why and how history has played out, on a broad scale, the way it has. It's not hard to see why he was awarded the Pulitzer for this.    -Colin Gershon
B001TH16DS|5.0|Fans of the original Star Trek series are not going to be disappointed in the Blu-ray version of Season 1. The picture has been cleaned up so that it looks like it was shot in high definition. The enhanced special effects are an improvement on the originals, they look like what might have been done back in 1966 if they had the time and money. It is possible to view the shows with the original effects, but those have not been cleaned up like the rest of the scenes. I believe that the end credits have been expanded to include the names of performers that were not shown in the original broadcasts.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier is one of the most powerful books I've read in years; I was painfully trapped in the experiences of young Ishmael.  I recommend this memoir to readers of all ages. I could not put the book down.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|So much has been said already about how great this series is that I'll limit myself to a few comments specific to the HD edition.<br /><br />Overall I was very pleased with the video quality; this was my first Blu-Ray purchase and I bought a new Blu-Ray player to watch it now that the prices have come down and are so reasonable, and I have to say the difference in clarity and detail is noticeable even for a new viewer to the format like myself. Since resolution is proportional to the square of the diagonal (sorry to wax a bit nerdy), the 1080 format has about 2.5 times the resolution of 720, according to my quick back of the napkin calculations.<br /><br />The sound quality also seems better than my usual DVDs. Perhaps it is done in Dolby 5.1 or 7.1? Anyway, the dynamic range is also impressive and several times I had to turn the volume down during several scenes which I don't usually have to do with many of my other DVDs.<br /><br />My only quip, as with many of the commenters here, is the missing 110 extra minutes of additional material in the non-HD edition, which is why the four instead of five stars. I guess I'll forgo seeing that for now, and look to pick up a used set later. Also, I've seen the Sigourney Weaver narrated ones on the Discovery Channel, and I prefer Sir David's narration instead. And I say this as someone who's something of a fan of Weaver, but her narration is a bit monotonous as others have said.<br /><br />I also saw some animals I didn't even know existed before, such as the caud-caud (a miniature cat found in Argentina, not sure of the spelling), the Amur leopard of eastern Russia and Asia (again not sure of the spelling), and other rare animals that I've read about but never seen caught on film. Overall a truly spectacular and probably once in a lifetime set of DVDs.

0743277708|5.0|I read it when it was first published, and I've read it twice since then.

0894803123|1.0|This book is well done, interesting BUT in this day and age, no one should encourage eating raw eggs and that is exactly what the recipes do - nowhere do the authors mention COOKING the raw eggs for their basic ice cream recipes.      I won't make any recipe using raw eggs without cooking them.    Too bad, the book is entertaining and informative.    I want a refund, please.
0307277453|3.0|\\"Your Inner Fish\\" looks at how humans evolved. I was hoping the book would have been more insightful like, 'OK, we evolved from earlier life, but what does that mean, besides where we came from?' Anyway, the book covers evolution well, mentioning things like this:<br /><br />1. 99% of species which ever lived are extinct.<br /><br />2. Fossils are one of the major lines of evidence we use to understand ourselves.<br /><br />3. About 375 million years ago appeared the first intermediate form of life in fish which led to the appearance of a land animal.  Specifically, this is when fish fins began having bones like in our upper arm, forearm and parts of the wrist.<br /><br />4. There are exceptional similarities among creatures as different as frogs and humans.<br /><br />5. Genes are switches to make fingers, arms, toes, etc.<br /><br />6. Teeth are important to study - likely evolved when animals began eating other animals - feathers, scales, etc became necessary because of teeth.<br /><br />7. The head is made up of plates, blocks and rods. No developing living thing begins with a head. Stages of development for every creature are similar. There is an 'organizer cell'.<br /><br />8. Collagen is important for body development - it comprises 90% of a body's protein, by weight.<br /><br />9 Probably, when oxygen first appeared in the air, did land animal bodies develop.<br /><br />10. Since soft tissues in bodies don't fossilize, that is why DNA is so important to study the history of bodies.<br /><br />11. The sense of smell developed as a tool for survival. DNA is present in every cell, but certain genes are only turned on in certain cells, like only in nasal cells, here. Sense of smell genes make up 3% of the human genome, but most are inactive/useless unlike other animals which needed better senses of smell to survive. Likely, most of such human genes are inactive because they weren't needed as the eye was developed so well in humans. Likely, the eye developed the ability to see in color when so many different colors of plants/food emerged.<br /><br />12. The bottom line is that every living thing has parents, the operative term being 'descent with modification.'e bottom line is that every living thing has parents, the operative term being 'descent with modification.'
B0000062FL|5.0|I got this album when it first came out on vinyl and it's as fresh today as it was when it was released. This in my humble opinion was the best of all the Santana albums released. I consider this one as well as the 1st and 3rd albums Santana's best albums. The bonus tracks though to me are nothing important, it's the album that is the main release this CD is a classic. I don't collect Santana but have all their best albums in my opinion. I saw some reviews giving this a low rating, geeze, what were you listening to! I am sure they will soon put this one out in a two CD version like their 1st/2rd albums. So what are you waiting for? buy this this one, take a sample listen, no matter if your white guy like me or some other race, this one crosses any racial boundary.<br />Check out my mini-web site, Google it \\"Judemac Forever\\"<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />Black Magic Woman (Album version is far superior to the 45 RPM mix)<br />Gypsy Queen (great track to segue to Black Magic Woman)<br />Oye Como Va<br />Hope Your Feeling Better (A \\"B\\" Side to Black Magic Woman on 45RPM) & could have been a \\"A\\" side very easy.
0307450570|4.0|This is book is quite extensive and I recognized some chapters were articles that I had read from past issues of Martha Stewart Living magazine.  I was disappointed that there were no knitting or crochet projects.  If I had accessed  the table of contents and had noticed this lack, I most probably would not have purchased this book.
B00164KYV4|5.0|I have nothing much to say about this movie except the fact that I love it. It's not a typical chick flick. It's real, and it's true.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|I'm sure many thorough reviews have been written for this movie so I'm not going to waste a lot of time.  Bottom line, this is an excellent movie that I have watched many times, and every time I watch it I notice some small detail that I didn't notice previously.  The case itself was fascinating, and one that would have easily been solved with modern forensics and crime scene work, but in that time and in the rural locations that most of them occurred, crime scene investigation was rudimentary at best.<br /><br />As far as the difference between the director's cut edition and the no frills version that was released in theaters, with respect to the movie itself the differences are minute to say the least.  I can easily say that this was the worst director's cut of a movie in terms of what you get in the way of additional footage, and what impact that footage has on the movie.  It's only like 4 minutes of additional footage as I recall, and none of it actually adds anything to the movie, in fact if anything those added scenes only make it drag, and rightly belonged on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />That said, the value of the director's cut edition is in the extras which can be found on the second disc in the form of interviews that were done with nearly every significant person that was involved with the case, from the survivors to the policemen, sheriffs, reporters, friends of the prime suspect etc. etc..  Nearly every major person was still alive and interviewed for the movie. The extras disc is actually just as compelling to watch as the movie itself, and at times will have you convinced of the guilt of prime suspect, and at other times will leave you seriously questioning it.<br /><br />Sadly what was noticeably missing from this version were the deleted scenes, none are to be found on either the basic Zodiac DVD or the Director's Cut edition, yet we know from some of the extras on the Director's Cut second disc that there were certainly some that existed.

0451196716|5.0|I've read all of King's books and I'd go as far to say that this is one of my favorites; not only did I find it fascinating but the theme & thoughts of the book stayed with me for a long time afterwards.<br /><br />The Long Walk is the story of just that - a walk that begins 100 competitors, and finishes when only one is left standing. They walk through the day and night, rain or shine, while eating and while sleeping. Slouch below speed and get a warning. Get 3 warnings and get a ticket - in other words, a bullet.<br /><br />Garrety and the other young walkers start in high hopes, become friends and enemies... and start to ask the same questions that we as readers are asking - why are they doing this? Why would anyone volunteer for this?  For me, the biggest questions were what on earth has happened in the world that not only is this an acceptable competition, but one that is encouraged & cheered? One whose non-supporters must keep quiet for fear of not only being seen as anti-establishment but are also squaded?<br /><br />And ultimately can there any winners in this, other than the eager crowds watching or the General, who makes his brief but arrogant appearances?  We learn the fate of past winners, and can our hero, Garrety, be one of them? And if he is, can there be a happy-ever-after for him even if he wins the ultimate prize?
1401907725|5.0|I love this deck. This provides yet another way for you to connect with your angels. The \\"Time to go, Trustworthy guidance, and There's nothing to worry about\\" are some of the best cards in the deck. It really helps focus you what the divine  has to say on your issue. Some other messages are:<br />Assertiveness- we help you assert yourself lovingly here.<br />Perfect Timing-Now is the perfect moment to act on your inspirations.<br />New Partner- A chance meeting is no mistake.<br />Cleanse and Detoxify- Detoxify your precious body.<br />Relationship- (As you get closer to God, your relationships heal)<br />The Ocean<br />Entrepreneur-(you have what it takes to run a business)<br />See Only Love- (see only love in others and yourself, and the situation)<br /><br />I am really grateful she created these decks to connect with your angels. Because of her, many people feel closer to their angels. The positive imagery has helped many of my therapy clients.
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Great mid 90s action movie. Keanu is on form both physically and in the delivery of his cop on a mission character. Great chemistry with Jeff Daniels as his police partner. Sandra Bullock shows why this movie launched her into the A-list mixing book smarts, spunk, charm and resourcefulness as the bus passenger entrusted with keeping the bus moving at 50mph. A real wildcat. Bullock and Keanu are great foils for one another. The special effects transfer well to the blu-ray format and the sound is intense, especially in 5.1. A number of signature Jan De Bon action sequences keep the pace fast and explosive. Dennis Hopper has some great one liners and plays the villain with psychotic glee. The stunts and set pieces shows how far CGI techniques have developed over the last 15 years. Greta movie to revisit on blu-ray.
0312117337|4.0|I own many tarot and oracle decks. I love this deck for its artwork. Its is inspiring and optimistic. Certain cards feel a bit stupid like the nothing card and schizophrenia. The booklet can help tarot beginners.<br /><br />Some examples of Card and Images:<br /><br />Breakthrough = man raising his fist and pieces falling away from him as if he were encased in red cement. Stunning yet gives you the exact idea needed.<br />Lovers- Two people facing each other above a geometric shape, red heart with two faces in gentle outline, and red roses underneath. Beautiful and very clever.<br />Patience: Woman with pregnant belly sitting calmly among rainbow colored foliage and moons in every phase across the top of the card. Ingenious use of lines and color.<br />The Dream: woman watching daydream/vision of lovers embrace in night sky.<br /><br />Guidance: Angel in rainbow, mostly yellow, orange, red color against blue night sky and woman standing as Angel rushes past her.<br />Slowing Down; Turtle on brown ground crawling past forest and various colored plants.<br />Adventure: Child walking with back turned walking into rainbow colored forest and black edges on card.<br />Understanding: Gold bird flying up when 5 gold birds flying down in background. Nice.<br /><br />You get the picture: Clear cut words and non traditional images used to evoke powerful emotions to give you the message from the Universe.<br /><br /> I use my intuition so much, I threw the book and went with the feel I got overall to give a reading. It worked better for me that way. I must say, if you get only one deck (tarot) you might want to try something more traditional to learn tarot first. I bought this after I knew the tarot pretty thoroughly and was able to read from it.<br />If you want to meditate on positive things in life, this deck is useful for that. I have done that with good results, having a good meditation and better perspective on an issue. Visually oriented people and people like modern art would love this deck.would love this deck.

B002BUVJ66|5.0|This book gives a wealth of information for angel enthusiasts, spiritual people, manifestation practices, healing practices, and visualization techniques. I bought the book for guidance and to inspire me to be positive for my future. It did just that. I recommend it to my clients as a psychic and psychologist.<br />I loved it so much I gave it to one of my best friends as a Christmas gift. She loved it and uses it as an oracle for advice daily. If you believe in God and want to encourage others that connecting is really easy, this book is a good introduction to how easy and comfortable it can feel. I draw alot of strength and love from this book and am very grateful for the book.
B001EN71CW|3.0|This was an excellent series, too bad it was prematurely cancelled. I was excited to get the Blu-Ray version but when I watched it I noticed some scenes had been cut on the BR edition.  One example - towards the end of The Train Job - where the medical supplies are returned - is not on the BR version.  I would recommend the regular DVD version of the series.
B001FB4W16|1.0|I was looking forward to rewatching Season One this week, in preparation for Season Two starting this Sunday.     However, HBO has done a lousy job manufacturing these Blu-ray discs. I've gone through three sets, all with the same problem - discs 2 and 5 refuse to load on either of my Blu-ray players. On *three separate sets.*     I ended up returning all three sets for a refund, then watching the episodes on my On Demand service. It's too bad, because I wanted a set of high-def discs for my collection, but HBO really dropped the ball on this series.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|A superb recording of the performance, but I was extremely disappointed in Amazon's product description in that it said \\"Orinoco Flow\\" was performed.  It wasn't!  Celtic Woman's rendition of that song is the best and one of the reasons for my purchase.  Error or lack of truth in advertising?
4789011623|5.0|The textbook is just what I was hoping it would be. I've been told that the language itself is very difficult, but I was surprised to find that it was simpler for me to comprehend then my previous instruction in French. The beginning work is very straightforward and smoothly transitions from using romaji. I do suggest spending a fair amount of time practicing and memorizing the hiragana and katakana. It makes everything easier. I'm not sure if that was how the process was intended to be, but overall, I highly recommend Genki's text.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I grew up in the 80's, and have found myself recently going back to old music and movies of the time to create nostalgia, and relive some of the memories from that time. I never watched this movie in theaters (I was 4 years old), but was always fascinated with pictures, excerpts and the video game at the arcades of this movie. When I saw the 20th Anniversary Edition of this movie, especially with all of the special features, I had to buy it. I really enjoyed the movie in the context that it took me back to a more fun and innocent time. It brought back many fond memories, and is DEFINITELY a product of its time. Yes, everything involved is extremely outdated, and makes for a very cheesy movie, but that's part of the fun. The only thing is that the creator of the story mentioned Star Wars as one of the biggest inspirations when making this movie, but nothing about this movie can even come close to the phenomenal movie/story that is Star Wars.

B001FB55I0|4.0|After watching this 4th of the Terminator series, it is clear to me that James Cameron was the key reason behind the Terminator series's success. McG, the director of this film, seems to be gifted in action sequences but rather poor in editing.<br /><br />Everyone knows that very few films will ever measure up to the first two Terminator films. The 2nd Terminator (Judgement Day) still ranks as one of the greatest action movies of all time and the 1st Terminator does not rank too far behind. This is an entertaining film which will unfortunately forever be compared to the first 2 films. This film falls short of the first two.<br /><br />The best portion of this film are the action sequences. The Mad Max like thrilling action sequences are breathtaking. This Terminator film brings back much of the old school special effects using real stuntman (not CGI) to perform very dangerous yet entertaining stunts.<br /><br />The film suffers from a noticeably bad editing. The sequences do not flow well in many scenes. For example, the scenary between the Blair Williams and the thugs are shown abruptly right after Marcus Wright and Blair developes a romantic chemistry. The scene which a human prisoner is shot by a T-600 is best described as choppy.  You will notice more than few sequences in which few hours of filming seemed to have been condensed into few seconds.<br /><br />The storyline is also very choppy as well. It appears Dr. Serena Kogan's role has been changed many times. That's too bad since I think Serena's role could have been a pivtol and a fascinating one. Perhaps Marcus Wright's original role has been altered more than a few times. The storyline is not entirely coherent.<br /><br />Moon Bloodgood, who plays Blair Williams, was the most convincing actor. Sam Worthington has proven himself to be a bonifide action star. And Christian Bale has done nothing to derail his action star status.<br /><br />Perhaps the director McG tried too hard to condense this film into under 2 hours. I think the film would have benefited from another 15-25 minutes and a more consistent storyline.<br /><br />Lastly, I think this Terminator film does not portray the post Judgement Day human suffering well at all. Where are the starving and wretched human existence? Does John Connor's greatness reside primarily in his knowledge of the Skynet and the Terminators?ted from another 15-25 minutes and a more consistent storyline.

B00005NWM3|5.0|I have liked Nickelback since I first heard \\"How You Remind Me\\" which was a great pop rock song, blended together just right.  Really also liked the vocals and lyrics.       I never got around to getting the record, but heard the song on the radio and purchased the record.  This is very good and well rounded, with poppier fare like How You Remind Me and songs that are a bit darker or not quite run of the mill rock.    Maybe they do pay homage to older rock acts and perhaps they have been overplayed, but it does not detract that they write well and I enjoy listening to them.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I have never reviewed a book before, but this book was awesome. It is gripping, surprising, and not the least bit formulaic. I can usually figure out what's going on in a book way before the ending, but this one caught me by surprise. This is a must read.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Great and ingenious special enhancement effects allows me to enjoy the episodes like new all over again.  my only complaint is that they don't seem to be arranged on the disc in chronological order of broadcast.  Nevertheless, I plan to buy seasons 2 and 3 when they come out.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO did a superb job with this mini-series.  David McCullough is one of my all time favorite authors and I was worried HBO would not live up to his book \\"John Adams\\", but after watching and rewatching it, both HBO and David McCullough should be equally proud of their productions.  As the daughter of a historian who also shares his love of history and tried to follow in his shoes, I can't wait to watch this show with him.
B00005JKNF|2.0|This film reveals Robert Altman to be a director's director.<br /><br />That's a slight, if you didn't get it.  What is means is that while other screenwriters and filmmakers might appreciate the subtlety and craft of this film, the common man won't.<br /><br />And I maintain the common man won't.  This is a slowly-paced, literate film.  It analyzes class relations between the Brits, and even the relations between the Brits and the Americans.  There's a lot to it, but you can't have ADD if you wanna watch it.  You gotta sit down, pay strict attention, and give it a chance.<br /><br />The problem is that I have ADD, so I was bored out of my skull by this film.  If I wanted a script about class relations that convoluted, I would read Waugh or James.  I wouldn't be watching a movie.<br /><br />The film is highly derivative, owing much to Rules of the Game -- and numerous others.  And the film is repeatedly self-referent in playful way.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't see what it sums to.  A few hours after finishing it, you'll have forgotten all about it.
1595141979|5.0|kinda sad ending but very good book best so far cant wait for the next one, i read it in a few hours cause i couldnt put it down
1400063736|2.0|I have seen the documentary, \\"Man On Wire\\" and agree that Philippe Petit's feat of spanning the distance between the Twin Towers on a tightrope was the best and highest art in the last forty years. But McCann's inclusion of it hardly recommends his overly chatty, and underly believable, characters.<br /><br />They talk too much, delivering their thoughts and motivations in rambling spews and never come close to resembling anyone you might meet in real life. The hookers are all attractive, sassy and thin; the old folks are witty, brilliant and foul-mouthed, and the cops are one-dimensionally cruel and bullish. \\"Flat\\" is the word I'm looking for I think.<br /><br />But some of the writing is good and the metaphor spot-on -- referring to nostalgia as a \\"museum of memory\\" for example. But in the end, a clever turn of phrase will not save this book from loving itself far too much, leaving the reader feeling as if she's being patted on the head. It left me cold and tired from screaming at the page.<br /><br />Not recommended.
0307454894|5.0|A short novel that's written in clear, precise prose, \\"The Reader\\" is a worthwhile piece of fiction by German author Bernhard Schlink.     The plot centers around Hanna Schmitz, a middle-aged woman with a mysterious past who seduces a young boy and oddly makes him read to her. I thought she was well developed, complex, and lovely, and she only becomes deeper as the story goes on. The other main character, and the story's point of view, is Michael Berg, who falls for Hanna as a child. She never tells him of the crimes she has (or has not) committed, but at an older age he attends her trial, and it is from this perspective that we learn of what Hanna has been accused of.     In the end you find out what Hanna's dark secret is that's \\"more shameful even than murder\\"... and some readers will buy into this conclusion; others will not. I had a hard time with it at first, but once I considered it a bit more, and took into account the sociology, setting, and government of the times, it did make sense.     When we meet up with Hanna after she's been imprisoned, the transformation (as well as conclusion of her character) is one of the best in literature that I've read.     There are some issues that need to be taken into consideration, such as the translation from the German. I always wonder if we're reading what, exactly, the author would have written if it were to be created originally in English. But this translation works well.     I would recommend this book to you if you're past the level of literature that you, as a reader, can think, analyze, and decide for yourself. The plot is heavy and considers morals (personal, as well as social and political) regarding war, sexuality, and shame - shame that is impressed upon us by society's convictions, as well as shame that is created within our own selves. And it shows us what all this Shame will drive us to do, but Schlink does not tell us why. That will be your job.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|No problems with the shipping and the products packaging.    I have all three of the Shinedown offerings and I feel that this is their best work yet.  Everybody has different tastes in music, but if you liked their first two CDs, I recommend that you get this one.
B00278U1W0|5.0|One of the most memorable film sequences in any movie I have seen is that of the fly fisher casting his line in the Montana rivers of \\"A River Runs Through It.\\" What is on offer here is even more sublime. The sound and the cinematography are crystal clear with extraordinary definition, but that all pales as Clapton and Winwood, fly fishing buddies at home, secure their lures and cast their lines, weaving music of rare emotional gossamer beauty and compellingly accurate force. All in all, rock's very finest moment.

B0094LZY2A|3.0|It's hard to watch Robin Williams being funny after his suicide.  I understand suicide is a personal decision and I don't have any opinion on his suicide but it's still very sad to watch him in a movie.  He was one of my favorite comedians and we'll miss him.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|This is a classic cd by a great band.I remember when it came out in my senior year such a great cdand band.
B00007G207|5.0|There is too much in this film.  It is medieval or baroque in its symbolism and relentlessly postmodern in its conclusions.  Praising it seems almost passe, but it is certainly one of the central films of the 20th century, and it should be viewed as such.    I teach this film in philosophy classes in conjunction with Walter Benjamin's \\"Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction.\\"  The director, Tornatore, clearly takes Benjamin's notion of 'aura' seriously, and he calls attention to how film itself (as an industry and an art form) exorcised aura in favor of politics.      Because I see the film through Benjamin, the main message of the film to me is its rejection of the collapse of politics into nostalgia, the collapse of love into obsession.  Perhaps Alfredo's gift to Toto at the end is a sign that we can take, as one student said, \\"the passing away of human life\\" seriously.  Perhaps.  But that would mean that directors are blind and work with random fragments of previously censored material that others then use to reckon with the manipulation of their desires.
B001DHXT1G|3.0|I fall in the middle with this one.  The movie was good for me, not great, but good.  I'm glad that Abomination was finally introduced, yet the CG form departed too much from the great comic renditions out there.  Edward Norton is a better Bruce Banner that Eric Bana was, yet the CGI of Hulk is still missing something.  Blu-Ray features are OK, but you can also get them on DVD.  The BD Live feature is a yawn.<br /><br />Bottom line, only go for this if you're a Hulk fan and the price is below $20.

B0015HOFZI|5.0|I read almost all the other reviews and most were very helpful. i received in about 3 days. I connected it to my existing audio equipment replacing an older turntable and it worked great. I installed the audio studio software on my dell laptop, it immediately had a new version to upgrade to which i did. I followed the prompts as they came up and it worked great. One thing: no sound from my computer but I do not care since it is connected to my home audio system. I downloaded my old 45s and then transferred them to my cell phone music player. No complaints.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD works and works good! I have been doing this DVD for three weeks and am now on level 2. Jillian is a really tuff trainer and really works you through out the 20 minutes and she does not allow breaks unless it's for 5 seconds then she wants you to get right back into it. She really encourages you to keep moving until the 20 minute work out is finished.     I do this DVD for 5 days a week and on the other 2 days as well as on the 5 days I use the DVD, I do 12 miles on my indoor exercise bike (4 after breakfast, 4 after lunch and then the last 4 after dinner.) I have also stopped drinking soda. I am 21 years old, 5'1 and when I started this DVD I was 180 poundes (though people say I didn't show it that much) After three weeks of using this DVD I have lost 10 pounds, a good amount of inches and am now 2 pant sizes smaller. I have also noticed I am starting to get my figure back as well.       I will forever use Jillian Michaels DVD's from now on. After I am done with this one, I am planning on buying her other two and maybe the 2 biggest loser ones to give myself a variety in my workout. Be advised, when you start working out, you can't just stop when you reach your weight goal. You have to keep with it. I used to be in great shape and when I graduated high school I stopped working out-BIG MISTAKE! Continuing to work out will not only help you be in shape and look good, but it will also help you stay healthy.     If you want a good work out, if you want to loose weight, this DVD is the one for you. Buy this DVD and you will thank yourself later.      UPDATE-6-26-09: I have started Level 3 and bewarned, it is a ROUGH level. Even the short warm up in the begining is rough and you have already got up a sweat by the end of that warm up alone. The day after I started level 3 I was very sore. Level 3 is a level you do not want to take lightly.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|As a kid, Speed Racer was one of the cartoons that I raced home to see.  I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Is this the best movie I have ever seen?  No.  I doubt it will win any awards.  I take that back.  The effects and colors are great.  Scary at first.  The colors were so bright, they were overwhelming in IMAX.  But once I got used to it, WOW.<br /><br />This movie was just plain fun.  It was two hours of being a kid again.  And the sound effects were exactly the same as they were in the cartoon.  That made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun movie to watch with your kids on a Saturday afternoon, this is it.<br /><br />I hope the studios keep making clean, fun, family movies.  I'll buy them ever time.

A large number of one, two, and more move mates are shown.  I think there are 600 miniatures from master games and some of his famous daughters' games.  Overall an unusual and large collection of material.
B000FSME1A|4.0|Good movie.  Too far fetched for this Viet Nam vet, but I guess it was primarily a slightly mixed up mixture of the classic book Heart of Darkness and the frustration of the Viet Nam war.  I did not think it was a great a movie as many do.  But it was well made and engrossing.  I wasn't wild about Brando's performance either - contrary to popular perceptions.
0618551050|1.0|The first thing that the potential reader should know about this book is that it is not about physics at all. It is about ideology. It uses modern physics as the backdrop for presenting an ideological position and a world-view.    The intellectual level of the scientific arguments can be fairly gauged by the following quotation from p105. of the hardcover edition.    \\"The world does not appear to have 25 dimensions of space. Why it is that the [string] theory was not just abandoned there and then is one of the great mysteries of science.\\"    If the sheer stupidity of this statement is not immediately apparent to the reader, he or she should substitute any of a multitude of counter-intuitive ideas from the history of science to see how it pans out. Of course everyone knows - Professor Smolin above all - that we don't abandon accepted scientific theories because they conflict with everyday \\"commonsense\\" perceptions. If we did there would be little left of science and Professor Smolin would probably be fretting about the dynamics of billiard balls and the like instead of quantum physics and relativity. Which makes the above  statement little more than a cheap shot at string theory, and of course a visceral dislike of string theory and its practitioners is the major motivator for this book.    The early chapters of the book give a reasonable description of the more recent developments in advanced physics and would be interesting were it not for the constant interruption of autobiographical snippets, anecdotes, ad-hominem digs at fellow scientists and   attempts at a strange, often clumsy, humor.    The last few chapters deal openly with what I consider to be the main point of the book and which I want to address. What this part boils down to is a weird melange of half-baked philosophy and sociology, amateur psychology and a huge spray at the \\"establishment\\".    Professor Smolin's estimation of the value of Feyerabend's deconstruction of the scientific method is hilarious. I can assure the reader that very little of Feyerabend's harebrained epistemological anarchism has stood the test of time and even in the atmosphere of wild intellectual anarchy, in which we now find ourselves, his ideas have been quietly put to sleep one by one. You could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of working scientists who still take his ideas seriously. It's disappointing but probably very revealing that Professor Smolin values this childish dribble so highly.    It comes as a huge, unwelcome surprise to me that a scientist as accomplished as Professor Smolin, who also has academic qualifications in philosophy, should have such naïve and confused ideas about his own field of expertise. But perhaps it's par for the course. My philosophy lecturer, who made a mid-life career change after being a successful researcher, told me that most working scientists care little for philosophy and that in general I should be wary of those who do. More often than not they have half-baked ideas based on some need to validate their own positions.    If after reading Professor Smolin's book you are amazed at the clannishness and closed minded group-think of academia then you must have led a very, very sheltered life indeed. The problems of the modern University are myriad and if anything physics and mathematics have escaped relatively unscathed from the unrelenting attacks on scholarship, one might say attacks on rationality, which have engulfed much of the Western intellectual tradition. What is puzzling however is the way this in-group behavior is presented by this book as though it is an entirely novel and unprecedented phenomenon rather than the longstanding norm. It is a historical fact that Einstein almost lost out on his first academic appointment because he dared to question the accepted wave theory of light. Only Planck's recommendation, in which he played down the young man's \\"foolishness\\", secured the position. Of course Einstein went on to be rewarded with the Nobel price for his foolishness. Nothing much in academia has changed since then.    The in-group, out-group dynamics of organizations is not only well understood and documented, it is almost certainly inevitable given the human psyche. These shenanigans are experienced by anyone who has ever belonged to any group, say the boy scouts, or any organization with rules of acceptance and shared beliefs. And the topic has been done to death by every psychology department and MBA course in the world.  It is our very good luck that many great minds choose to be outsiders and to pursue their ideas without reference to accepted dogma thereby avoiding the dangers of the group-think which exercises the good professor so much. I hope that Lee Smolin turns out to be one of these great thinkers and that his ideas prove decisive in cracking the five great problems he poses at the start of the book.    Each time I have picked up this book, as I have done over the last year or so while I pecked away at this review, I had very much wanted to like it. It is after all about a subject I find fascinating, by an author whose many original contributions are widely quoted in the technical and popular literature, and it is well written. But each time I have been disappointed. If you want to find out about physics, you don't need this book - there are others much better. And if you want trite sociology, homilies about the evils of modern science or just psychobabble - they can be found elsewhere too.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|If \\"Gran Torino\\" actually proves to be Clint Eastwood's final appearance as an actor (and he has said so), I can't think of a more fitting swansong; his portrayal of an antisocial, racist widower, facing his own mortality while relearning compassion from his hmong neighbors, is a magnificent performance, certainly one of his best. It combines elements of many of his classic characters, with the subtlety and depth 50 years on both sides of the camera has taught him. Some will howl at his language and obvious bigotry, but without this coarseness, we would not truly understand his pain, or fully appreciate his spiritual rebirth.<br /><br />This may sound crazy, but I found myself comparing \\"Gran Torino\\" with \\"The Shootist\\", John Wayne's final film. Both films involve protagonists who are dying of cancer, mentoring boys, and ultimately ending their lives while ridding society of a dangerous element. With due respect for Wayne, I believe the Eastwood film is far superior; Eastwood's characterization is much deeper, the 'community' is portrayed in a kinder fashion, and the resolution is both smarter, and more effective. The film offers humor, as well, an element largely missing in the Wayne film.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is a film guaranteed to be on the short list of Eastwood's finest; I'm proud to have it in my DVD collection!

0679847367|5.0|Often times, I get graduation announcements for people I want to send a special message to. This book is the perfect gift, regardless of the graduation level or sex of the graduate. I have yet to not receive a thank you note for my gift of this book.
B001HPP2X2|5.0|Dexter is a serial killer, he kills because he's compelled to do so... but you approve and like him.  Dexter is probably the only serial killer you could ever actually like.  I give this series 5 stars and it earns it.
630463949X|4.0|The concert is great, my only complain is the disc itself: bought the DVD \\"new\\" (from Amazon), the packaging was sealed, but when I opened it up and looked at the disc.... I could see finger prints and light scratch marks on both sides, looks much like a used disc!    But it plays fine, so I kept it. Again, a great concert.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Dexter is probably the only serial killer you could actually like.  I definitely enjoy watching it, and it will keep you waiting to see what's going to happen next.
159448385X|5.0|This is a very depressing story, make no mistake about that. If you pick up a book about Afghanistan, you shouldn't be expecting a \\"beach read\\". However, if you want to read a story about characters you will care about and maybe step outside your comfort zone I highly recommend this book. I loved the writing and the emotion that was evident throughout. I preferred it over Kite Runner.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Great CD. When Music was Music. Johnny Cash Is a Great Singer. Good Vocals and Guitar Player. The Man In Black Never Disappoints. Highly Recommended for any CASH fan.
B001UREJWM|3.0|These old guys can still put out some metal. Iommi is solid and RJ Dio does what he has always done well, belt out great notes from the feet to the lungs. He is still in great vocal shape, unlike the caricature that has now become what we call OZZY.    Lots of good songs here, granted, I think on a couple tracks the boys try a little too hard to be dark and scary(IE \\"Bible Black\\"...) They shouldn't, they have nothing to prove. They invented the genre and in this case less is more, no need to fill in every blank for people. However, they are filling a void in metal and giving the people what they want. Hopefully we will get a few more albums and tours from this second Black Sabbath lineup. It certainly seems to have the most potential and productive longevity.
