0679722610|4.0|Red Harvest<br /><br />Donald Willsson hired a private detective from San Francisco. When the Continental Operative (CO) went to Willsson's house his young blond wife answered the door. Donald won't be home. Then he went to City Hall to visit the Police Department. Donald, the publisher of the newspaper, had been rubbed out. The CO meets Bill Quint, the head of the local IWW. He learns about the local economy. Hired thugs broke the strike then took over the town (Chapter 1). Donald started a reform campaign to clean up the town. The dirt was stronger. The next day the CO meets Donald's father Elihu Willsson the czar of Personville. He tells what he saw. Was Donald's wife involved? Elihu disapproved of Donald's policy. The CO investigates the newspaper (Chapter 2). Donald wrote a large check to Dinah Brand (Chapter 3). The CO talks to Chief of Police Noonan; they share facts. Widow Willsson explains.<br /><br />The CO visits Dinah Brand (Chapter 4). Why did she want that check certified? Knowledge of a future strike could allow a profitable investment. Dinah offered information for that money. The CO warns her. Early in the morning the CO gets a telephone call from Elihu; he wants the town cleaned up (Chapter 5). Also, a dead burglar was in his room. The CO visits the Chief, they plan a raid on Whisper's joint. They won't have to prove anything if he is shot resisting arrest. The CO learns a lesson as he enters the place (Chapter 6). The CO figures out who really shot Donald and the motive (Chapter 7). But there' more! There is a flurry of shots thru his hotel window. A warning to get out of town (Chapter 8)? Can a local boxing match be fixed (Chapter 9)? The CO learns about a hidden crime (Chapter 11). He gets a statement from a witness that will take care of Whisper (Chapter 12). A telephone from Dinah brings him there (Chapter 13). There is a surprise and conflicts. The other operatives arrive and will be put to use (Chapter 14). They travel to the `Cedar Hill Inn'.<br /><br />Dinah collects her fee (Chapter16). Chapter 17 tells about crime and punishment in Personville. As they motor to the \\"Silver Arrow\\" they hear gunshots. There is a peace conference at Willsson's house (Chapter 19). Will this end the gun-work? A telephone call tells what happened to Noonan (Chapter 20). The events are summarized. There is another murder under the CO's nose (Chapter 21). There are new members to the police force (Chapter 22). He learns about another murder. A lawyer calls the CO with an offer to defend him. The next morning the CO finds another body (Chapter 23). A notebook has a clue, so too four letters. The newspapers reported the news (Chapter 24). How accurate was it? Reno and his boys go for a ride (Chapter 25). There is success, then complications. The CO visits Elihu Willsson and tells him to call the governor and ask for the national guard. Then he goes to look for a deserted warehouse (Chapter 27). Does it have bootleg whiskey? The next warehouse has bodies and a solution to one murder. The CO takes a vacation, and learns how the town was cleaned up under martial law. [Will the same conditions lead to the same problems?]<br /><br />The name \\"Personville\\" is a generic name for all the towns named after a big land owner. Hired gunmen were brought in for strike-breaking, then took over the city. Machiavelli's Letter warned against a mercenary army: they can takeover the government that hired them. Only a citizen army is proper to a republic. Creating a militia of armed citizens could have put an end to these gangs, but they would gain political control. The 1877 strike in Pittsburgh's coal and iron industry led to the abolishment of the traditional local militia and its replacement by a state-controlled militia. Newly powerful corporations controlled state governments, the new \\"National Guard\\" developed into a strike-breaking force with the power of law.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is wonderful for kids and adults! Excellent story line and fantastic graphics. Can't wait to check out the 3 mini movies that came with it!
B0080SZ0V8|3.0|This game would be interesting if it wasn't just one puzzle after another and very little in between. The puzzles themselves are interesting, but it gets boring after a while.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|It was kind of a relief not to have someone who is in love with the Doctor. Donna is so funny and works super well with David Tennant. This may be my favorite season and is for sure my favorite companion!
B00COMLLX2|4.0|The game play is a lot of fun. There are even little hidden secret levels. The only down fall is that you have to purchase any other pinball designs they offer.
B008QPCCQQ|1.0|Although I am a tremendous fan of Louisa May Alcott, and was excited to buy this collection, it was a waste of money.  I could not navigate anywhere in the collection.  I managed to get to the first page of the book MOODS, but it would never turn a page!  Thank goodness it was not expensive, but wasn't even worth the $1.99 I spent.  Such a disappointment because this supposedly had some of her rarer stories.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I love this game. Though admittedly I still haven't been able to beat it without dying! I will prevail!! The levels are fast paced and the weapons and gizmos are fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is the best show I have ever seen on TV.  I was so sad when I finished watching the entire series that I nearly cried.<br />You must see this show.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I said I loved piano music and The Piano Guys are so much fun and enjoyable to listen to.  I am thoroughly enjoying the CD and hope they do more.
B007ZYABW6|5.0|Superb piece on a little-known but awesomely difficult achievement:  walking out of northern siberia some 4,000 miles south through/near china to  India.  They did it - survivors of the Gulag! Free at last.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game has great graphics, addictive, and is better than dungeon hunter 4...that is what I think. Recommend it for whoever wants a great fun game.
1452101248|5.0|Great and tasty recipes! Love it - we have tried a few of the recipes and both meat and veggie lovers alike adore the interesting flavors, colors and textures. Great addition to any cooks shelf.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Was told I got the perfect gift. I don't know much else about beyblades but the 7 year old boy was happy!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Absolutely love this show brilliantly written and cast with a plot to die for. Never watched as much tv before watching this and now I will watch everyday till I'm caught up! Thanks!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A story for anyone who loves music and wants to know more about an inspirational music legend. Fans old and new will love this!
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|Took me a while to figure that this is the prequel to Wizard of Oz.  Great effects and beautiful colors. Actors were very good.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think that this game is an interesting building game and it is a great deal cause it is free
B000UD08HW|5.0|What to say about the group that has changed the way rock was played ever since? So you have one of these group leaders performing some of their best songs. Comfortably Numb with David Bowie is absolutely unforgettable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wish I had read the book before I saw the movie.... really was a great book but would've been better if I could've imagined it all without having had the scenes set by the movie.....  can't wait to read the next one!
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 5 and 3 yo love these Dr. Panda games.  I think they are great because they teach simple cooking concepts and make the idea of scrambled eggs more attractive. (they are picky eaters)  I like that they wash dishes too.  Overall, adorable graphics, easy to understand game play and very entertaining.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This was my all time favorite card game to play!! Now that I have it I play every night!!! Best game ever!!
B00068TJM6|3.0|I went to a store decided to buy it from the pics I had seen online because I have had many a disappointment buying online blindly.<br /><br />The watch is beautiful, very techy-looking and has a circular slide rule bezel similar to a Seiko I had ownwed in the 70's so I was determined to get it. But I found it to be nothing like that one.<br /><br /> While having stunning looks and great finish, a saphire-type crystal is not unheard of at this price range. This one is not only the ordinary mineral type, but it is also domed and reflects the light in and manner that makes you look for a good angle at which it will not do it every time you have a glance at it. From experience I know that this shape and type of crystal scratches very easily.<br /><br />It has a neat function that aligns the hour, minute and second hand I had not seen even on watches costing 4 times as much. The alarm on the other hand, is such a pain to set I doubt I would ever use it. Plus, it is bordering inaudible in quiet room.<br /><br />The bulky crown and button lockers might carve the back on your hand depending on the way you wear it. They should, IMO, should have been positioned on the other side of the watch. The batteries are said to last over 3 years. I would have to see to believe, but again, at this price range it could have featured a solar-powered movement.<br /><br /> If you're expecting a hefty watch, this is NOT one. Not only it is disappointingly small but also suspiciously lightweight. My guess is Seiko skimped on the thickness of the case. Embarassing. I got the Orient M-Force diving watch instead. While automatic (no batteries needed, so no need for a jeweler to reseal/repressure the watch for many years) and not an aviator/chrono with a slide rule, that one has the size and quality I expect from a watch, at almost 9 oz. and a generous 46 mm diameter and a usable ratchet bezel at the same price.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents. If you are into dressier, conventionally-sized, light watches, this one is for you. If you want a strong, hefty watch like me, give it a pass.h like me, give it a pass.
B00992CF6W|5.0|LOVE IT! It's fun that lasts as long as you want! Great game for all ages, even my 17 month old brother was &quot;playing&quot;! Worth every Penny!
B005NQ94KS|5.0|I had originally seen this movie in the theater and then did a rental on it.  I was curious about the behind the scenes stuff that they usually have on the DVD but the rental copy did not have it so that's why I bought it so that I could own everything on it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really cool I think everyone would enjoy it because it's so cool and very very very awesome
B004LROUW2|4.0|I admire Murakami for his ability to create a world completely realized--so familiar and yet so foreign at the same time. He is also a master of building up tension as he sets his characters in motion. However, with this book, the payoff does not meet the expectations he raises. After Aomame meets the Leader (which one would expect to be the crisis point of the plot), we still have nearly half a book to read, and all of the menaces that are brought forth early on, in particular the Sakigake group, drift behind the mist and do not offer our protagonists any further complications. It seems as though the story wants the happy ending. Murakami's book Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is not afraid to offer us an equally compelling vision but with a plot taken to its logical conclusion.
B00E8B1358|3.0|The usual action with very poor acting. The Rock, no longer carries any weight and Bruce Willis is just &#34;old&#34;.  The effects were okay and the plot predictable.  I don&#34;t see a number 3 in the future.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman's latest is a quiet story without the grandeur of American Gods or Stardust, so do not read it expecting the same sort of vision or experience. Instead, he has crafted a short, simple work that explores not only the life-changing experiences we have when we are young but the life-defining doubts we suffer as we grow older.<br /><br />Speaking of growing older, this is the sort of work that one often finds from mature artists who have come to realize that &#34;simple&#34; does not equate to &#34;childish&#34; or &#34;simplistic.&#34; C. S. Lewis (whom Gaiman references in this book) did the same thing with Narnia, and Hayao Miyazaki has done it also with Ponyo. What these artists have done is stripped away much of the artifice and left us with the fundamental themes that are at the heart of true storytelling.<br /><br />If you keep these expectations in mind, you will enjoy the book for what it is: an excellent and thoughtful work of art.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|It's a catchy song that makes you want to dance and it's a real \\"Pop\\" song! Can't wait for the album! Hopefully it won't disappoint.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|Should be their last sequel. They're starting to embarrass themselves. This not the seventies or eighties. No imagination. This is tired stuff.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles you will love Magic Jigsaw. It is so much fun to do and  you don't have the mess of a boxed puzzle. The  Puzzles are beautiful with vibrant colors.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|James Gammon, Tommy Lee, Ned Beatty, John Goodman ..They're the best.. Always are so good in portraying southerners. Good story, very plausible stuff..
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|I have no idea if this movie is good, the stupid Amazon site downloaded it to my Kindle Fire for me to watch on a long plane ride, but when I tried to view it, the Kindle kept wanting to go the internet and said I needed an internet connection to watch a movie I paid for and spent 20 minutes downloading to my device.<br /><br />Stupid and frustrating!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Big HP fan so I have all of them but not all in blu ray great quality and some movies have special features disc! :)
B00C4XYEBW|5.0|With over two hours of Priest style Heavy Metal I was thrilled when I heard the first notes to Heading Out to The Highway to the powerful version of Beyond the Realms of Death.  Halford and company deliver another stellar concert experience, and even with KK Downing gone from Priest's line up, the addition of Ritchie Falkner as his replacement I feel was well received and I felt to some degree that Ritchie actually seemed to breath some new life to the band. His interaction with Glenn Tipton throughout the concert seem really fresh and very energetic, and made the experience for me all the better.<br /><br />Of course the members of Priest have grown older, and even the Metal God has succumbed to the ravages of time. Some songs where I wish I would have heard the legendary high notes that made him the singer that other metal gods could only aspire to, but I was surprised at some of the notes that he was able to hit during several of the songs that he performed.<br /><br />All in all if your a fan of the Priest, than this is a DVD that you'll want to add to your Metal collection.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|The options seem cool....but it's hard to find pics once they are saved or posted and in saving your finishing pic.  They should make the close down and start up easier instead of just leaving it on the board.Still looking for Pico I sent and posted on FB......  : /
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Good movie with good twists and turns. The plot wasn't cerebral by any means. Still though, it was a good watch.
1452000247|5.0|The first thing that caught my attention was the character of Peter. His inner world was rich, and he was different than most children in his age. In that curiosity the author managed to attract me to the storyline. There was something in the reality of order; that is in the environment of Peter's surroundings that made Peter all the dreamier and recluse. As a reader I sought the spiritual world with him from the very first mention of his peculiarity. As the storyline evolves Peter enters the dreamy world of magic. Here the reader cannot escape the memory of the wonderful classic of `Alice in wonderland' even though Peter is quite a peculiar character in comparison with Alice. In fact, as a reader I felt compassionate towards the ten years old boy, and often I have believed that he was a victim of autism. Thus, at each adventure I felt that Peter deserved to find happiness and inner peace for his outer reality, since the real world was a disaster. His escape to the world of imagination, particularly with the fairies, was in a way his way to cope with his hard life in school and at home. The darkness and the evil energies which shrouded Peter all the way to the end represent the struggle of a human being against the spiritual forces of darkness. Peter's way to deal with his own demons and evil seemed unusual, but not without success, for his captivating imagination surpasses all evil through the wonderful and funny characters with which he encounters throughout the tale. Monsters, witch, mice, elves, fairies, a fish, toads, among many other characters gave the story a very rich texture. It felt like drinking a soup, rich of spices and vegetables, served as a wonderful book for the palate. I really enjoyed the poetry in the end. My favourite poem is `The Fortress'. However, my favourite lines are found in the poem `Kipple'<br /><br />Quote:<br /><br />`My path will weave<br />The way you say<br />There is no doubt<br />You'll create the way'<br /><br />It means that despite of all of his difficulties and all of his troubles, Peter is trusted after all because of his creative mind. There is something about that boy that can be found in all readers. The chaste inner self, who just wishes to find happiness and attain peace, love, and harmony; this book, in my humble view, deserves to be a bestseller without any doubt. It was both rich in adventures and filled with hidden morals in regard to the eternal spiritual war of good versus evil. In this case Peter has won over the dark forces owing to his creativity and courage. Perhaps his biggest fear was only a guise for his true character. Perhaps he was a gallant knight in the guise of a fearful boy. What a great book.espite of all of his difficulties and all of his troubles, Peter is trusted after all because of his creative mind.

0765325950|5.0|Was a good read . A long road to get it done . With the death of Robert Jordan it was nice to have some one steo  in and finish this very long series....took a lot of years to get to the end of this tale. But all in all well done
B009E3EY38|5.0|Get this. It was awesome! Blu-Ray surround with the band was just amazing. Great extras too. They were so much tighter on this concert than back in &#34;How the West was Won&#34;
B000AGTPUU|4.0|First off let me say that my son is obsessed with trains and this is absolutely his favorite movie, ever. He asks to watch this movie every single day. We have bought 3 times already because my son keeps trying to put it in the DVD player himself and scratches it. Needless to say that I am so sick of this movie and I don't love the story at all. The elves are super creepy with weird voices and the guardian angel comes across as the \\"bad guy\\" in my sons mind. Then one of the little boys  sings a song saying \\"I guess that Santa's busy cause he never comes to town..\\" basically implying that he doesn't get presents because he is poor. How are you going to make a movie telling kids that Santa is real, but poor kids don't get presents? That is my number one issue with this movie. However, I will give it 4 stars only because my son loves it so I guess it doesn't matter too much how I feel about it.
B0041KVZ18|5.0|Is my favorite Beatles album. Especially on vinyl, it brings back many good memories. I will definitely be buying more.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I started the series because the entire five seasons were available for free under prime membership. However, after we finished season four, Amazon decided to charge to watch the fifth season. Honestly, I would not have started it if I'd known that they would do that. I felt like my friend broke a promise. Bad form Amazon...bad form.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Was unsure about this app cos people were saying pics wouldn't save but it was free today so I figured, why not?  Glad I did, works great on both my Fire HD 8.9 although it does save under the camera not under regular photos. Also works on the HTC One X perfectly. Amazing app, does really cool stuff!!
B00AAQTW1C|4.0|Great!!! Haven't owned this since the 70's,,,  Good to have back in the collection. All the good oldies you love!!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|When I Tap to open a picture, the window opens, but doesn't show me any location to choose.. The box just remains empty. I tried twice and waited for quite a while.. Sorry,but I uninstalled..
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was a great book and it taught me how to conduct myself in and outside the military. Support this awesome literature.....
B000P0J0A6|5.0|Love the fast delivery.  This movie is 2 parts funny and 1 part thriller.  Get ready to sit and laugh at the silliness of the main characters and and be surprised at the many follies of the fluffy then creepy little wonders.
B000WC4A8O|4.0|Fuller, richer sonics than in the original lps especially in the bass and drums but noticeable too in the guitar.  The horrible left/right balance of \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" in the original lp that leaned heavily to the right has been corrected.  Unfortunately the channels are reversed compared to the original lp of Led Zeppelin I.  Right is left and left is right and there is a little truth to the sound being compressed for the sake of loudness compared to the original lps but the lessening of the cowbell on \\"Good Times, Bad...\\" is more than made up for with ridding the original record of it's papery sound.  Everything is fuller as it should be and loud (for good or bad) and the slight loss is that now the vocals now don't stand out as they did in the originals.  All in all it is better now than in the originals with the caveat of the fact they reversed the channels.  In the original lp of Led Zeppelin I in the first track the guitar is more left and drums more right with the whack of the cowbell on the right.  Check your cd's.  I've never heard them.  Analog purists should know that these lps are most likely \\"digitally\\" remastered.  Even so, because of the far better balance it is preferable overall.
044024613X|5.0|Africa the Serengeti....sound changed all the time.  Was this the tape or what?  Sometimes to loud and other times had to turn the volume up.  Frustrating.
B008133MDK|5.0|The writing is superb, the cinematography is brilliant and the acting is.....BAFTA winning. That this should have lost the Emmy to Downton is a travesty. Martin Freeman's Watson is beautifully nuanced. Gone is the bumbling sidekick and in his stead we have a man who is, in many ways, Holmes' equal. Cumberbatch as Holmes continues to win over fans by bringing just enough heart to an otherwise wholly unlikeable human being. He is himself possesed of a rapier sharp intellect, so he brings a believable gravitas to Holmes' rapid fire deductions.<br />Moffat, Gatis, et al continue to bring the stories we recognize to life in an entirely new way. Looking very forward to Series 3!
0812550706|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I'm shocked I have never read this book before.<br /><br />I LOVED it.  The story line, the characters, the military tactics - all of it.  The book is very well written and has a solid, fulfilling ending.<br /><br />I know there are more books (prequels and sequels) and I am very much looking forward to reading them.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Goofy little dudes! Can't help but laugh! Left right up down whoa! Gotta keep it going! You gotta love this game. Run while you can!
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We have our granddaughter during the day. She has been using the jumparoo for about two monthes. She laughs and plays with all the attachments. She gets great exercise and will be content for 30 or 40 min.
B002PZC8BM|4.0|Pretty decent show. It's easy to follow and Simon Baker is great. The rest of the characters aren't too deep but you get enough to get by.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Beautiful story of redemption.  The music is wonderful and the actors are superb.  Have tissues handy - you'll need them.
B000002H97|5.0|This was always one of my favorite albums.  Had it on cassette long time ago and played it to death.  Here we go again, hurray
B0059WTMLW|5.0|What you'd expect.  A good game with different skill levels that keeps your kind working.  Good to play when you have a few minutes to kill.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I never knew just how erotic sex could get until I read this trilogy! What an absolutely amazing work! Thank you for bringing life into something I always considered dreadful!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is spectacular. I highly recommend it. You will get very emotionally attached to the characters and the story.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|I fell in love with Monster High when they first came out! Whoever thought of them must have a lot of fun creating the dolls and weaving their stories together. They are dolls so they are not meant to be bashed around like tonka trucks ( otherwise I would give 5 stars on everything). I love that the theme with MH is tolerance and embracing diversity- I think that is educational and very uplifting! The dolls are so unique, each with their own stories and problems to overcome. Twyla is no different! A beautiful doll with a great story (captures nightmares from normies). Of course, normies associate her with nightmares and so are afraid of her and MH kids can't understand why she cares! Interesting story. I look forward to learning more about her and her adventures!!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years. I am going to buy a dozen of them and share them with a spirituality group that I have formed. I first became aware of Rhonda Burns book the secret, and then I became acquainted with Abraham – Hicks. This is a hands on and practical how to book. Three cheers! I can't wait until my other dozen books arrive so that we can get started.
1416955070|5.0|I love the plotline a d the heroine being an \\"average\\" girl- or so she thinks. But like us all, we are so much more than we realize. The boom is a great easy read and I can't wait to continue with the series!
0684853523|5.0|I have, I'd say, fifteen books on the writing process and most do not come near to the heart-felt commentary provided by Steven King on the process of writing. Filled with self-analysis and his own, painful journey as a writer, King outlines the nuts and bolts as well as the psychological and real-world concerns of becoming a writer. Not only that! He offers a real-time challenge! He poses a plot-line and character arc and asks anyone who is willing to write a short story based on them. He promises to critique each offering - a very substantial promise by a very busy writer.<br /><br />I cannot be more pleased.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Engaging characters and storyline. Plenty of plot twists and turns.
0802473156|5.0|A must read that will help elevate your relationship to the next level.  It gave me tons of insight on ME and how to more effectively deal with my spouse!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Plenty of action and good dialogue.  Some scenes dragged on too long but overall the pace was a good tempo.  I never read the books nor was I aware of their existence so I would because of my objective view, recommend it to anyone.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd to get in shape because my friend recommended it. She credits this video for her 45lb weight loss after the birth of her first baby. I however made it through the first half, took a break, and never went back. I think it's still sitting on top of my dvd player 4 months later... but for anyone who isn't as lazy as me, this would probably be a really good work out! I know my friend stuck with it and got great results lol
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Good story, great cinematography, and good acting but unfortunately slow.  This is a movie only to be watched at the cost of at most a red box.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It is cool because there is no creapers and  you get all the  sudplise  you need and I love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|it was  a nice change from the usual shows<br /> an how people dealt with different eras - of<br /> history an life
B00873GRU4|3.0|I kind of enjoyed this book but also found it a tiny bit frustrating. It was so good I wanted to know the outcome, wanted the end to come, but it kept going. In retrospect, for me it was a little too long, towards the end I was skipping and scan reading paragraphs of information that really seemed to be immaterial. One less character introduction or plot continuation and I would have loved it. As it is I really want to read Shift, but I'm worried I might drown in the storyline. The good bits. Great writing, painter of pictures, the images clearly jumped out at me. Suspense galore!
B00CL8D83U|5.0|I really like this album.  I sorta think of the Pet Shop Boys as being soft but I like this album a lot and start to finish it's pretty solid.
B004AP9W46|5.0|Definitely thought provoking in regards to the whole God devil Heaven and Hell ideas .... Anne Rice is a fantastic story teller
B007WULJ5G|3.0|This actually rates between 2 1/2 and 3 stars. I bought the uncut version because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Honestly, all the reviewers calling this flick hard-core pornography, a snuff film, and most disgusting movie of all time are b-sing you. The cinematography is much better than I expected, but the story is alternately boring and ridiculous. NOTHING in this movie is all that shocking, unless you have a really sensitive temperament, are the squeamish, easily-offended by anything type, or an arch conservative. If you want to see real porn, get it on the internet. As far as the plot goes, many critics over-dramatize the events portrayed as being disgusting, over-the-top provocations to test the audiences' tolerance for revolting sexual and murderous acts. The nude sex scenes are soft-core, no actual penetration is shown, no REAL genitalia are shown, and the \\"infant rape\\" scene is fake, shot in darkness. The rape scenes are no worse than you would see in a Hollywood production with a hard-R or NC-17 rating. In fact, I found the many sex scenes to be so hilariously over-acted that I laughed. I did not find the brutality of the beatings, drug-induced sexual mania, and the beheading scene to be any more gross or gory than what you would see in any guts, gore, and sex horror flick. The over-the-top climax was truly hilarious, with our bug-eyed, enraged protagonist using his supposed over-sized erect member to kill a guy by ramming it into his open eye socket. When the camera pulled back, it looked to me like the lead actor was wearing a fake strap-on dong you can buy at any porn paraphernalia store. The price for this publicity-overblown flick is ridiculously high for a film so overhyped by media critics and film reviewers. If you must see it, buy it. But be warned: lower your expectations to be shocked, horrified, disgusted, or sexually aroused. As I said earlier, if you want to see hard-core sex acts, they aren't in this film. Go watch porn instead.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Wes Anderson's use of bright colors and alternate realities provides a good escape for the viewer. I recommend this product for anyone who is interested in an aesthetically pleasing cinematic adventure.
B008602KQI|5.0|Having read the novel prior to watching the movie I had a very high expectation for the movie and fortunately it came through and provided a near perfect adaptation of the book. If you enjoyed The Hunger Games you may also enjoy Japans manga and movie Battle Royale which many people have compared to the The Hunger Games.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It is cool game enjoy with all your friends it's mind challenge !!! Try you will like this one I am enjoying this first time for me.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is for a young to middle age adult.  I'm 55 and my thoughts are at a more mature stage.  There are too many sexual encounters and too much detail on them.  A teenager could write those.  This makes the author appear immature to me.  A literary work this is not.
144234430X|4.0|Not a big fan of horror stories, I've never had an opportunity to read any of Stephen King's work. From this novel, though, I can certainly say that his writing is strong, captiviting, and gives you that on-the-edge-of-your-seat feeling. 11/22/63 is a compelling book, one that deeply pulls you in. I've been on a tear of reading time travel novels recently and this one is truly exciting. Every day I couldn't wait to start my commute to work so I could listen to this audiobook!<br /><br />King weaves actual historical figures and events seemlessly with fictional characters in a unique premise to time travel. The so-called \\"rabbit hole\\" is located in the storage room of an old diner, and every time somebody steps into the backroom, they are transported to September 9 1958 at 11:58 AM. Al Templeton, the proprietor of the diner, instructs our protaganist that \\"every time is the first time.\\" If you mess something up, just come back to the diner and step throug the rabbit hole again. Every time you step through, it's September 9 1958 at 11:58 AM again. As long as you don't change so much that the diner isn't there anymore...<br /><br />The audiobook recording is wonderfully performed by Craig Wasson, who has recorded several other Stephen King audiobooks as well. With memorable voices and intonations, it is more of a play than a reading. Clocking in at 30 hours, though initially daunting, I found the time flew by as I became increasingly immersed in the web of fictional and historically educational storylines.
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|I'm really enjoying their great sound and this was just the type of new music I have been looking for.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The adventure ends with the heroine left standing albeit changed forever. Lessons on hard choices and trade offs of life.

B004132HZS|5.0|The fabulous thing is that each episode stands on its own as a great movie -- well written, acted, and directed. I enjoy the movies and Elementary series too, and each iteration is so different from the others that they are all enjoyable. With each episode I laugh and marvel at the wonderful characters -- the BBC Sherlock Holmes is just perfect entertainment!
B008MZPUXW|5.0|Amazing throughout the album. A must listen. Definitely shows his ongoing growth as a songwriter. Super melodic and low-fi, it's a great rainy day album, or sunshine day. Whichever you prefer.
B007WPM7SO|5.0|A dramatic contrast between battle scenes and serene French life.  Excellent acting all around but especially from Eddie Redmayne.<br />See it!
B004HWYTP4|2.0|I am so glad I watched Red 2 before Red.  I really enjoyed Red 2, but Red was not even comparable.  If I had watched Red when it was first released, I never would have watched Red 2.  Red 2 was great.  Red 1 was worth the low rental, but not much more.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|Great movie .. love the whole series. I would recommend this movie to everyone I know. Must buy this movie.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Great to clean to, listen while drinking coffee or tea, being by yourself cruising on the road, or hanging out with friends at a party. Rich vocals, from the gut singing, and reminds me of a past somewhat lost, but longed for in our reincarnations of the eras that came before us. Recording sound raw, not over studio polished, and real. I believe them, I believe in what is being sung and sing along. thumbs up.
B009B08LJ2|5.0|Great movie .. love the whole series. I would recommend this movie to everyone I know. Must buy this movie.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Just Buy it.<br /><br />What else can I say about such an honest, undiluted, &#34;real&#34; sounding group of songs? Each possessing their own story, the feeling of a coffeeshop/bar, the authenticity of aching, the flippant nature of story telling? Catchy, stuck in my head in a good way, and speaks to audience in a sincerity that isn't overdone. No regrets and look forward to next album without a doubt. Worth it.

B0018YIW4S|5.0|In 1979, a CT radio would let listeners come in to the studio to play songs for 1/2 an hour. One of the songs was \\"Too Hot To Handle\\".<br /><br />I went to the record store the next day, and bought Strangers In The Night. I played this album to death during the summer of 1980. My parents had split the year before, and I was 13 at the time. Lights Out, Love to Love, and (I'm a) Loser healed me. Now coming up on 50, and I have never tired of this album.<br /><br />The CD sounds terrific. After listening to the vinyl for so many years, the revised track listing threw me off. \\"Natural Thing/Out In the Streets\\" has been in my brain since 1980.<br /><br />If you buy only UFO CD, this is the one. Then, get \\"Lights Out\\".

B00CLZ48FA|3.0|Okay so we do a prequel to the famous rendering of the 1939 Wizard of OZ by trying to capture the black and white/color fantasy with modern dialog and 'adult' dramatic moments....ummmm...no don't go there..but they did and they did pull off a homage to the great people of MGM and the hundreds that lovingly put Judy Garland in harm's way of  Margret Hamilton and her flying monkey minions. The flying monkeys in this pic are much more frightening, the world of OZ is more in depth with new characters of equally fantastic backgrounds to meet and that does a certain service to the imagination of Frank L. Baum who wrote the books of OZ to delight his generation's children. However the stylized story and music that made the 1939 such an enduring hit are not here and we are awash instead with CGI and mediocre humor. (Note to Disney...give up trying to make money on properties of books you own that date back to 1906...kids today are not that well educated so the soaring adventures of  John Carter, the Lone Ranger, citizens of OZ and so forth do not stike a cord with the youth of today.)  I loved John Carter of Mars, haven't seen the Lone Ranger yet but thought OZ the Great and Powerful would make a fun two parter to the Blue Ray Wizard of Oz...for grownups that saw Danny Kaye introduce the film to kids on CBS in 1962. WSo in view of that suggestion..go get it...to make the story of the carnival magican and later the young girl of Kansas a tret to see on your home theater screen.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|A combination of first-class actors with good dialog, and fantastic action scenes.<br />Recommended for an action-seeking audience.<br />Can't wait for the sequel.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Fairy tales can come true..they can happen to you if you are young at heart...my apologies to the late and great Mr. Sinatra but it seems our fairy tales need to be updated for the modern audiences and CGI and camera wizardy are going full bore to keep everyone guessing if Jack will save the princess.  He does and all live happily ever after...unless the kingdom was wiped out by the Black Plauge..we are not given privy to that information but we do get to see a lot of giants.  They are mean, smelly and uncivilized...and they throw a lot of trees and cows and stuff at our erstwhile heroes trying to defend the castle. They could have used some help from Thor and the Avengers or even the Transformers but they were occupied with other missions...in another time...lol!  It is worth a single night rental to amuse a 8 year old ...3 stars..and that is a generous offering in this humble reviewer's heart.
B003G4W49C|5.0|this book was really amazing. I couldn't put it down. I never thought this book would be one of my favorites,
0671449028|5.0|I gave this book to my granddaughter for her first birthday.  She loves it.  Has her mother read it to her every day.<br />I would recommend any of Sandra Boynton's books.  I have purchased many over the years for the grandchildren.

B000FC2KL0|3.0|Great look into the history of Anthony Kiedis. However, becomes a little less genuine towards the end. Either way, I appreciate the man and the band much more now. Certainly worth the read
B004FQX59I|5.0|This is a sad, but professionally excellent movie, based on Jim Garrison's \\"On the trail of the Assassins.\\" Camelot fell because Fascist forces at work shortly after WWII, culminated their dastardly deed right before the nation, while most of us were too busy re-claiming our lives, after having served our country in WWII.<br />The Warren Commission ignored credible evidence and kept the most revealing facts from the eyes of the public, such as the Zapruder film presented; ignored eye witness reports and many other facets of evidence.  The fact that the man JFK fired from the CIA sat on the Warren Commission should tell you volumns.  Much evidence has already been stolen, like JFK's brain! That would tell you JFK was also shot from the front.  All of our intelligence apparatus was compromised at the very highest levels; even the parade route was changed to accommodate the shooters.  The most glaring omission was the fact that District Attorney Jim Garrison revealed that Ozwald did not fire any shots in the preceding 24 hour period in which JFK and Dallas police officer Trippet were murdered; even the CIA did not have a conclusive report to counter this fact, even though Oswald was, like Ruby, his assassin, an employee of the CIA/FBI.  Noted Historians and Librarians were threatened by a claimed CIA official when all the evidence was revealed to them at the National Archives.  Why are we waiting until we're all dead to have all the evidence finally revealed?  Our Intelligence community's motives and actions will be revealed in 2029, if ever.  Oliver Stone deserves a medal for bringing this accurate historical movie to our attention; even though the reviews to the movie, JFK, show a strong bias to the CIA, FBI, etc. point of view.  So assume Oswald killed JFK & Trippet; they are all dead; why not bring forth all evidence (left), instead of waiting until everyone is dead, who were alive at that time? Read Joan Mellen's book, \\"A Farewell to Justice, Jim Garrison, JFK's assassination and the case that should have changed history.\\" Also, read Jim Garrison's book, \\"On the Trail of the Assassins.\\" Then make up your own mind.

B000AHJJDM|1.0|Was very disappointed when I bought it. It came in broken and it was a Vinyl I needed for my collection. It was shipped in poor packaging
B006YC74E8|3.0|Not my cup o' tea, but it's easy to use.  User friendly app that allows you to take pics and edit them.  Want more photo editing options though
B00451VH8E|1.0|I ordered it for our Blu Ray collection. It arrived and was in ITALIAN! Please be sure you are getting an English version when ordering your Disney movies. I didn't realize it but the seller was located in Italy and it cost nearly twice as much to return it to ITALY as to buy it. I ended up just keeping it since Fantasia isn't about the words. I would NOT purchase from this seller again as the advertisement seems very sneaky. The movie itself is awesome and I would recommend that!
B0097C8XL0|5.0|My little girls (ages 5 & 6) love this game!  My 1 year old little boy loves watching the cute penguins while his sisters play it.
034552554X|4.0|I liked the story for the most part, got terribly frustrated with the heroine for poor decisions, but loved the idea that each flower and herb tells a story. I sent the book to a friend mainly for the chapter in the back telling all about the &#34;language of flowers&#34;
B0097HSS4M|5.0|We love this photo editor!  It lets us take pics and has several different picture editing options available.  Is def. one of my favorite pic editors!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Intriguing well written story. I liked the shift in the middle. But, the ending -- though unexpected-- was quite disappointing.
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|Love anything that deals with zombies!!!  So this game is great!  Me and my fella will take turns playing it when one of us dies.  Wish there were more options for stuff though!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great game to play. Love hidden object games with challenges. Easy to play without spending money. My kids love it also.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Will be on the lookout for more games by MobiGrow. Fun game. With multiple challenges in each room.<br />I will recommend to friends.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Interesting, funny, trendy, foolish, silly, too much for one show but oh so glad for it. Really kept me occupied.
B008Y5UADK|4.0|Great indy film by Darren Aronofsky. (His first) Had interesting ideas and a flawed main character. Dark, and has a visceral feel with the old technology used in the film.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This is a pretty good, and handy, tool to have in one's pocket, back pack, glove box etc.<br /><br />Of course it is not great, but for lees than 8 dollars the price makes it desirable.<br /><br />I like mine esp the sharpener for serrated blades.
159463176X|3.0|I read this book twice in an attempt to find a common thread and make everything fit together. The author told a good story and attempted to portray the culture of Afghanistan. Understanding the characters and their relationships was frustrating. Often Hosseini introduced a name and did not give you the character's story until much later in the book. Sometimes it was difficult determining which character was speaking.There was no indication that the story was ending. Hosseini is a talented writer but this one doesn't come close to the quality of The Kite Runner.
B006FPFTMS|5.0|i like FOXIT on windows too, and it didn't disappoint on the Kindle.  Necessary and functional utility.  No-BS and fast.
B002B79BVO|5.0|Mad Men takes me back to the 1960s when I first entered the work force.  Everyone was smoking, and women could hold secretarial jobs for the most part.  I like how the character Peggy is portrayed -- very smart, and not much appreciated for her ideas except by Draper, her boss.  He sees that she's a whole lot more intelligent than the men.  Draper's marriage is also interesting -- the beautiful blonde stay at home mom versus the predatory women who take out after her husband.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzles are lots of fun can be challenging. I will order more games like this. My 7 year old grandson spent hours playing this.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great film about a historic recording studio. This is where all the great classic songs were originated and the sound still defines that sound today.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The research that went into this book resulted in a story that was riveting.  I intend to read it again as it is worth a second read, to uncover more of the nuances of this life.
B005LAIGIM|5.0|This movie was hilarious! I would recommend it for an afternoon of laughs. Eddie Murphy does it again. Ready to watch it a second time.
B009DCOU9S|2.0|Puzzles are ok, but the speech gets tedious, and it won't let you select something it doesn't want you to use right now, but only usually, not consistently, so you can't be sure if you just clicked the wrong spot.  Frustrating.
B0029O0BLS|4.0|Haven't seen it for quite a while but thought it would be good in blu ray and it was! Thanks!
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This is one of my favorite purchases from Amazon, to be honest. All six original films, plus a bonus disk! And for such a reasonable price! My only gripe is the box itself is a little frustrating to open and close, as the plastic sleeve just barely fits around the box. But it makes a fantastic display piece with the holographic image on the front, with or without the sleeve. I bought one for myself and then immediately bought another for my friend for her birthday.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|Really glad to see this series available. Never missed one the first time around and fun to watch again. Good clean fun.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved the way the story wrapped up but so sad to see all my favorite characters go! I will miss them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is way funner than the first and u get way more and cooler obsicles by hannah@horselover.com I love it.
B003B02OOG|5.0|There is no better storyteller than Grisham. Ford County is a little different in that it is a collection of independent short stories instead of a full length novel. Highly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|awesome game.  my son and I love it! prepare to laugh at minions as you jump and roll doing despicable actions!
1416955070|5.0|Clary has no idea that her night out with Simon is going to be the night that everything changes. Pushing Clary into a world she knows nothing about when she witnesses the death of a demon.  Clary is shoved into a world where stuff of nightmares walks the earth, while humans are oblivious to their very existence. Shadowhunters have long protected the humans from the humans so they are equally shocked to encounter a mundane that can see them.<br /><br />When her mother is suddenly taken from her she sets out to find the strangers whom only she can see and save her mother. Clary is sucked into the world her mother has worked hard to protect her from, learning that her mother has kept secrets about herself, her father and who she really is. As Clary uncovers more truths she sets out to find the mortal cup hoping to trade it for her mother but when it's taken from her by someone she can trust. When an old friend steps in to help save her mother they will head into battle risking it all only to learn that some long buried secrets are still out there waiting to be discovered.<br /><br />I like Clary she wants to find her mom even if it means risking her own life. She's a strong passionate character with lots of potential to grow into someone amazing. The author did an awesome job creating characters that are easy to connect with, who you either just love or just hate their guts. I know I have a few in the book I wanted to see killed off. However that's what makes a good book if it was all happy and easy the story the characters would be boring. I like the idea of Simon as a potential guy for Clary he's been there for her when she needs him even if he is just a mundane. Clary is kick ass on her own she which I also enjoy, fighting demons and taking numbers. I'm looking forward to reading more of Clary's story and seeing how she turns out when it's all said and done.<br /><br />I knew it was time to join the masses and check out City of Bones. It doesn't help that its movie is due out in just a week either or that my hubby said I'd never read it. Ironically we are both reading the book at the same time.  I love that the author created a world where humans as well as things that go bump in the night live together. The concept for the Shadowhunters is new and exciting, the way that they use their weapons or runes to living in an alternate world.  A truly unique idea that creates an intricately woven story filled with mystery, romance, action and twists that keep you guessing till the end. City of Bones is beautiful written it tells the story of Clary in a way that you feel like your right there with her experiencing everything she does. I had a hard time putting City of Bones down, I actually stayed up late reading only to pass out and finish the next morning. I also felt like I could ramble all day writing this review so I tried really hard to keep all the spoilers out. With great characters, a fantastic story it's no wonder there is so much love for the mortal instruments series. I look forward to checking out the rest of the series, plus can't wait for the movie.is due out in just a week either or that my hubby said I'd never read it.

B0095VPBM2|1.0|I think this processor came from a defective batch. It was the second in a row that I received that had bent spines on the board and, therefore, would not fit.
1416955070|2.0|I'll start with the good points of this series. The setting where we are introduced is (sort of) new and interesting. The idea that there is this magical world right in front of us with all kinds of races and stories is pretty exciting. It is only sort of new, since Harry Potter, Hellboy, and a few other stories did it first. But I'll give the author a break here, because it is done well.<br /><br />Now for the bad. The story. I know it is hard to come up with ideas without being compared to someone who did it first, you can almost see where the author went directly to other sources for ideas. We end up with an amalgum of Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Twilight. Almost nothing happens in this series that does not also happen in one of those. Still, we might be in for an intriguing story, except, the characters' innermost thoughts are too often telegraphed. There is really no mystery to any facet of the story. From the first hundred pages of the book, one can accurately guess the ending of the series down to about two possibilities.<br /><br />My other problem with the plot is the inconsistencies apparent early in the story. It's not as bad as some Teen Fiction (The Divergent series is one of the worst plot lines i could ever imagine in a lifetime. If this book is weak, Divergent is an absolute plague, and the reason I gave TMI 2 stars). But there are plenty of inconsistencies that try to make the story accessible to everyone. There is annoyingly unrequited love, and a dark, angsty homosexual character, who's problems are clear as day, but nobody in the book seems to notice. Jace states pretty clearly that he doesn't believe in a God or Heaven. Yet they have to go to a \\"holy place\\" (church) to get blessed weapons and holy water, without explaining where exactly did these objects come from. There are powerful evil beings, but no such thing is a greater power for good? Finally. Sometimes i wonder what authors want us to see in characters like Jace. He is about as likable as poison ivy in this book. The only factor that could possibly make a reader a fan of his is that he sounds stereotypically \\"hot\\". Same as Edward and the other vampires in Twilight. Do they think we readers are literally so stupid that dark brooding, stunning hair, daddy issues, and some lines of innuendo will make us fall in love with a character? I hate to typecast the female author, but 5 teen fantasy series come to mind instantly where this is the case. It doesn't work here any better. We root for the lead female character to fall for the main male character because we have no choice. There literally aren't any other options.<br /><br />Like i said, the world created in these novels is interesting, and may actually make for a good movie setting. Which is why i tried so hard to enjoy the novels. I will probably finish the series out, so i can say I gave it a try. But there are better options out there. If you need a teen fantasy fix, give \\"Under the Never Sky\\" a shot. It isn't perfect, and you will still notice the familiar plot points, but the storytelling is far superior to The Mortal Instruments.as poison ivy in this book.

B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This is a great puzzle game. It's very simple; try to recreate the ball in the picture using paint and tools. It got pretty challenging but easy to make it through all the levels in a day or 2. We need more levels!
B0027ZGPDC|4.0|Upon revisiting this entry, I ultimately found it a bit less exciting than the others, but.. I still liked it.  It's quite different from the others, and really stands out with portrayed Tokyo racing style.  If you're a fan of the series, you should definitely watch it.

B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I was really impressed by this.  I'd say a lot of CG movies these days are pretty average (not to say they're bad), but this stands out of the pack for me.  I was really able to connect with the characters emotions.  Highly recommended.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|I am so disgusted with the latest crop of 'Blockbusters' that they can sink so much into a movie and come out the other end with such disjointed mediocrity.  Sure, there is some good bang and zoom; great CG and good technology animation; however plot wise, kids in the back yard with a hand held camera and some Star Wars figures might have done better.<br /><br />The addition of Morgan Freeman to collect Deli Money for his quickie appearance as leader of the resistance makes one wonder if these people had anything better to do with their money.  Not to mention the Matrix rip off at the end.  Lord help us if this is the best Hollywood has to offer.

B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The combination of personal and courtroom drama keeps up the suspense. Can't wait for the third season the characters are quite likable.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was amazing, some very great plot twists, and such a unique topic to write about. I suggest this book very much.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game, lots of fun and using your mind. Please bring on more levels!!!!!!!!  It is too short of a game, but very creative and inventive.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I'm convinced that dogs are at least that observant & intelligent & wise. VERY enjoyable read. Good life insights. Enzo is wonderful.
0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wanted to read it before the first movie came out. Deffinately my favorite book of the series
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Maybe I should say George Orwell so people have the proper reference. I didn't care for the acting. I know that the story has emotions suppressed for the population to have a &#34;peaceful&#34; world but it just made for a very stiff portrayal and it didn't seem consistent for the entire cast. I can't recommend this one, I could have turned it off at any point and not missed seeing the end.
0345529057|5.0|I love the whole series. I loved the shows as well. At this point I am rereading the books and loving them even more
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|The story is intelligent with surprises of a mystery and possibilities and wonderment of sci-fi framed by great CGI and photography. Too bad I was forced to watch on my mobile device w/o option to use large TV screen.
0553801473|5.0|One of my favorite books of all times. What a great author, and I don't take my books lightly. LOVE it and recomend everyone to read the whole series
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful book, especially like the way all the ends are tied up. Couldn't put it down while waiting to see what would happen next.
0307472590|5.0|Fabuloso!! Un libro que volvería a leer!! la trama es impresionante! altamente recomendado! uno de los 50 que hay que tener
B000X6JESA|3.0|The green sheep doll is really cute, and looks just like the missing green sheep from Mem Fox's book Where Is The Green Sheep, It is smaller than I would like it to be.. If it were about twice this size it would make more of an impact.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|A great album, entire album is a success.  I do love every song, I do enjoy when an artist is allowed, and or able to make an album a success as this album has been made.  Upfront.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Stayed true to the story. No over the top stuff. Liked it a lot.<br />Would Recommend to Sci Fi Lovers
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Always deep within the mind, a great adjustment with it all.  I don't like loosing her albums during the shake of advancement.  Entire album is of great enjoyment.  I wish I could thank her for her great contribution to the day.
B00COHAUD4|3.0|Am a died in the wool Horror Movie person. I was all excited about seeing this<br />and hoped for more.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a wonderful and funny movie!! Uplifting after a hard day!! Great HD!! Worth watching as many times as you want to have a good laugh!!
B002R88G5E|5.0|Don't read this one without a box of tissues handy. The very real brutality portrayed was devastating and raw. I had to stop a couple times as I was emotionally upset. Great writing!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|It came new in the package. Excellent quality and it was exactly what I ordered. Can't wait to order Season 3.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This one would make a great little mini series. I'll be surprised if I don't see it on TV at some point. The twist was good and unexpected. I found it a good read.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I enjoyed this one a little more than most of the rest. Not sure why, but the plot was very good and kept me guessing. And Reacher as usual, was not all that forgiving...
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I was looking for a game like this for my Kindle and this has been great. It is challenging, but it's not so hard that you get stuck on a level forever. I liked the first one of these games so much that I went and got this one.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I really like this stylus. It does just what I thought it would. It acts as a very good replacement for the tiny stylii that cramp my oversized hands. My only complaint is that there's almost no way to fasten along with my iPad so I don't lose it but that's definitely not a deal breaker. It's still an awesome stylus.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun for people who like a little challenge and isn't hard to where you can't complete it and get stuck.
0316017930|5.0|Very well written and easy to understand. If you are interested in non-fiction, this is a must read. This is why it has been on best sellers for a very long time.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Tried it months ago and thought it was a bit slow. Kept seeing ad's on tv and hearing others talk about it so I tried it again. Now I'm addicted.
0066620996|5.0|Read this book if your goal is to become a great leader. When I talk to others about leadership, this is the book I discuss about.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Real<br />Make sense<br />Well Done<br />Great Actors<br />Interesting<br />Exiting<br />PERFECT!<br />A show you will enjoy.<br />this show will have you on the edge and<br />wanting more. Enjoy
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My cable arrived timely and in perfect condition, performs the same way. I ordered another one for my grandson, whose Kindle Fire didn't seem to charge with any of the products who claim to be &#34;just as good.&#34; They aren't. If I lose another one (and I most likely will) I plan to order it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is great I love it .I would recommend this game to my friends and family .it's also really good keeping the kids out of trouble while your busy
1419705644|5.0|This book is amazing im only like ten pages in and i cant put it down well i did to write this but you know what i mean any one how is a fan of adventure time should get this book. 10/10
B005D0TETA|5.0|All the classics I remember growing up with in my youth. Mostly the original band brought back many memories and the quality of the concert was excellent. I have many music dvds but this one has gone to the top of the pile. Regards Graham Kelly.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I usually play the classic form of solitaire but this is fun for me..  It is just challenging enough.<br /><br />L
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So many minions so I hope that the company that made this game even better by adding minions that have a theme like a halo theme or black ops theme or even a thor minion that would be cool and people would want to play it even more
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Pop music at it's finest! Great comeback single for Lady Gaga. Guaranteed huge club anthem, I can't wait to hear the whole ARTPOP album!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Having a lot of fun playing it with my granddaughter she loves the app. We figure out everything together. Very good. Would be nice to pick your own name for your horse and maybe what your rider looks like.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I really enjoyed this set.  It was a gift for my husband for his birthday and he was more than happy with everything about it. It is not the original but still a great way to enjoy Star Wars.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I love this game - beautiful clean screen and graphics.  The challenge is fun - completely doable, but still makes you think.  I will look at other games by Bart Bonte.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome graphics and dragons<br /> Best game ever made.<br />Fun for all ages.<br />Islands to build your own way.<br />Over 95 different dragons to breed, hatch, and buy.
B00AH6CYRO|5.0|I have been listening to Metallica from their start.  While different from the earliest albums, (Kill, Master and Justice) this is easily as good as those.  And for those who say it isn't like it was back then, get over it.  Metallica had been playing for 27 years when they released the album.  People change, expand, experiment and mature as time goes by.  Of course they are going to sound different.  I sound different than I did 27 years ago, I have some different interests than I did 27 years ago, I even think differently than I did 27 years ago.  We all change as time go by.  Allow Metallica the same ability to change and enjoy them for what they were and what they are now.
B007VTUYWW|1.0|All \\"action Jackson\\" and short on plot. Great flick for those who want to see a super woman in tight clothes saving the day. If only she could save my perishing mind from having to watch this ever again.
B000JQU1VS|2.0|I'm not sure if the stories are so predictable because the &#34;twists&#34; have been mined by TV and movies for over a century or they are simply too &#34;elementary.&#34;<br /><br />My biggest problem is that the transcription has several mangled words and amounts in each story.  There was more mystery in figuring those out.  I think it got scanned and the OCR couldn't figure out the font.  At least it's free.  I have this collection I bought from Barnes and Noble but never got around to reading it.  The kindle lends itself to easy access; although, these types of errors are common.  Proofread!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very fun game and it a great game when your just board and sitting around with nothing to do
B00EI6E17A|4.0|After hearing a leak of another ARTPOP track, \\"Burqa\\", I was fairly surprised when \\"Applause\\" finally arrived.  The two songs are nothing alike, and that just makes me more excited for the full album.  \\"Applause\\" is, considering Lady Gaga's recent releases, a fairly toned-down pop track that's more in line with her days from The Fame than Born This Way.  It's like it mixes the two styles together.  The result is pretty great, and deserving of the same level of success she's enjoyed since \\"Just Dance\\" took radio by storm.  The vocals on \\"Applause\\" hearken back to David Bowie during the verses before exploding into the upbeat chorus.  Short but sweet, the song's frantic beat doesn't let up before abruptly cutting off after a mere 3 and a half minutes.  It's far removed from the 4-5 minute opuses on Born This Way!  While not the strongest single in Gaga's repertoire, \\"Applause\\" is still worth of its namesake.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I'm really not a tech savvy Individual but this app was really easy to use even for me, and my 12 &amp; 13 year old kids love it as well.  The app was free when I got it, but this Is one app I definitely would have no problem paying for.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I share information between three devices. It is easy to use. I have found it very useful for keeping information for helping my clients and for recording questions and symptoms for Dr. Appointments.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|I love this book! My daughter, who is now 33, wanted it read repeatedly when she was little! I bought the Kindle version for my grandkids. I hope they love it as much as their aunt J!
B00CHILW64|4.0|Great acting, amazing story and very sobering alone the journey.  The horrors of the tsunami when it happened as presented on the news were hard to witness but this movies grit and rawness connect you even more to the tragedies events.  Well done and worth the watch.
159463176X|3.0|Let me start off by saying that this is a good book. Of course any book written by Khaled Hosseini deserves to be read for he is an exceptionally talented writer. However, after having read A Thousand Splendid Suns, it would have been extremely hard for him to have been able to at least meet the quality of it in this new book, let alone surpass that. And I have to say he falls short of event meeting it. The ending of this 400-page book is not one that I would have expected from Hosseini. When I finished Splendid Suns this feeling of joy and happiness and satisfaction arose on me that left me sleepless the night I finished it. After finishing And the Mountains Echoed, I felt still longing for that \\"ideal ending\\" where brother and sister reunite and get to live the end of their lives doing everything they couldn't in the beginning of their lives because of their circumstances. Nevertheless, Hosseini is still a favorite of mine and I look forward to reading his next tale that I am sure will take us on a roller coaster of emotions as he has done before.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is fun to have to figure it out. my son and I do it together! cant wait for the coming soon rooms
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Let me first confess that I am a big fan of this band line-up. This band covered a bunch of songs from many different musical genres and traditions but made them new and interesting. Jerry's playing is inventive and always interesting without the self-indulgent excess that sometimes marred the Grateful Dead in this period and Jerry plays straight ahead guitar without the meandering midi-stuff that sometimes was distracting in the GD shows. This band has SOUL. This band could do rock, soul, folk, gospel, reggae and, yes, Grateful Dead staples with an integrity that eluded and still eludes most bands. This is real music folks. Jerry's voice was perfect for these tunes and the emotion, when appropriate, he brings to the music is very palpable. You don't need to be a Dead fan to love this band. Mr. Garcia and Mr. Kahn were walking music encyclopedias and they loved arranging some beautiful songs-both old and new for their performance style. Jerry played banjo early on in his career and returned to it a couple of times along the way so it is appropriate that Bela Fleck would open for his band that day and also sit in with them. This recording is warm and detailed-capturing a wonderful show on a wonderful day. If you are hesitant to take a chance on this cd-change your mind and give it a shot-I don't know how you could be disappointed if these tunes interest you. See what Jerry could do with them on a good afternoon with willing co-conspirators.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've wanted to read this book since it came out and have no idea why it took me so long but this is a total must read! Tina Fey is incredibly honest about a lot of things most would lie about but she doesn't get dark with it, instead I was laughing so hard no noise would cone out and I almost speed myself. I really enjoy her style of writing too, it all seemed more personable . Definitely one of my new favorite books.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I have been trying to get a copy for some time now - not that they weren't available, I was just waiting until they became a little more reasonable in price. This movie, I believe, will become the basis of a generation of animation/real life movies. Can't wait for a sequel - hint-hint.
159448385X|5.0|I didn't think Hosseini could equal The Kite Runner, but he did.  A moving story from the view of Afghan women.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|We love David Cook.  He was my top choice for American Idol and I was so glad  he won.  He so deserved it.  AWESOME music!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I personally love this game and I'm always checking back to see what's going on in my park. There is one thing that bugs me though I have 1046 coins and the 999 coin option doesn't work.  Besides that it's awesome! Who doesn't love a giant park full of many varieties of beasts?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a Joss Whedon show, amazing cast, writing & directing, Fox was just too stupid to realize what a gem they had. BUY IT, YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!!!!!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Being able to stream this show, and other Prime eligible shows makes the Prime Program a great value.  Highly recommend.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my 2 yr old granddaughter, and with the exception of Ursula, she loves it!  Her mother watched this so many times as a child that she spoke and sang along with the movie verbatim.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Although I was a bit skeptical about watching this movie, I decided to watch it anyway. I loved the book and figured that the movie would pale in comparison to the book. But my god. The movie, for a lack of a better word, brought the book to life. The casting was great. Leo and Tobey did a marvelous job with their characters. The pageantry was amazing, colorful and just blew me away. The music surprisingly complemented the movie quite well. I just loved this movie and recommend it to anyone who had ever read the book. :)
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is a fantastic fantasy/sci-fi film and I am already looking forward to the second installment, &#34;Catching Fire&#34;. The DVD copy I rented looked great but the Blu-ray version looks even better...now that I have a 1080p high-definition TV. It's going to be the &#34;Star Wars&#34; saga for this generation.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|I loved the whole movie, Dennis Quaid should have gotten a Oscar for it!  He did the best Doc Holliday since Doc Holliday himself.  The whole cast was excellent.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Brandon Sanderson has keep true to the story and characters created by Robert Jordan and maintains the pace and depth of the Series. You will never find a change to indicate a new author has picked up after the first author ended
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I were searching Prime one Sunday afternoon for something to watch. We came across season 1 of Suits. Had a decent synopsis so we thought what the heck, we'll give it a shot. We were pleasantly surprised and by the end of the first two episodes (couldn't watch just one) we were hooked. Put season 2 on the watchin list as well (shouldn't be long until we get to it), as well as season 3. Season 3 is currently on tv right now, but the shows we are not putting on the dvr, we will more than likely rent through prime. Great show, lots of witty remarks. I think everyone wishes they could be as quick with remarks and comments as these two (on cover). Would srongly recommend this show to anyone.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I love it! It reminds me of the book I read when I was 12. Actors are excellent! I strongly recommend the show!
B008FQ1O1K|4.0|Unusual read makes you think about your life and how we evaluate time,would recommend it ,thought it was an enjoyable read
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hard to put down.  Sad but sometimes reality is sad.  Would definitely recommend it.  Good book club book.  Go for it.
B000MR1V22|4.0|In the beginning, the characters are all so raw that it is hard to watch, but as you progress through the story things get much better. The character development is great, and the ending is worth living room applause.

B00ABXA1HI|4.0|I really like this app, it's pretty useful and the input thing I find unsatisfactory is the fact that you have to pay to be able to use it when your not on the same network.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing :) absolutely loved it. Anyone who loves despicable me will love this game. I am definitely addicted. Highly recommend this game
0307586901|5.0|This book covers everyone of the holidays on the calendar.  The ideas cover various ability levels from the beginner to the experienced.  Instructions are detailed and well illustrated.  So many exciting inspirations that I can't wait to try them all.
0307950689|4.0|I was expecting the worst given the critics' and readers' reviews, but it was actually a pretty good read. Yes some of the plot is hard to believe, but that's consistent with most thrillers these days. Overall i found it engaging, relatively fast paced, with some interesting plot twists. It's been 5+ years since I read the Da Vinci code, and undoubtedly that helped as his writing is formulaic.<br /><br />The last few chapters however, were a significant detraction, and the book should have ended with the villain. Rambling on about some puerile pseudo-science left this reader with a bad taste as i closed the cover.<br /><br />Ok i would have given it 3.5 stars, if I could...
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much even the the power ups like grus rocket or fluffy the unicorn . (so fluffy)
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|It started out to be such a page turner. I couldn't put it down. By the time you reach 2/3 of the way, the story loses its pace with sooo many twists and turns you just want it to end.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|The story line for this movie is alright however the movie does drag on for what seems like forever. It doesn't seem necessary for this movie to be so long when it could effectively convey the story in say 1 1/2 hrs or so....

B00DP3IESY|5.0|For people who enjoy sci-if action this movie delivers it all! Don't listen to those critics who panned it..they are 'oblivious' towards true entertainment. This movie is compelling, tense, and has a pretty good twist to wrap up the end. Cruise is in fine shape in sci-fi and I look forward to his future endeavors in this genre.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If your a fan of the movie you will love this game. It's a lot of fun and I enjoy playing it. I think it's a must get.

B001TH16DI|5.0|I won't go into a whole review of each individual film, as I am not a learned Trekkie. Sufficed to say they are excellent.<br /><br />The films in this set are on the list that you must see if you consider yourself a film buff. Get past the Trekkie aspect, the space opera delivery, and look at the films in a technical light and consider them as products of their time; you will get an idea on how big an accomplishment each of them were.<br /><br />To often people are scared away from good films just by the sheer weight that the die-hard fans criticize them with, but it shouldn't be the reason to like or dislike them. Each film has its own little gem moments of camera work, acting, and special effects that make them a joy to view.<br /><br />If you want to dig deeper into the worlds of these films, there is a plethora of bonus material that will keep you busy and educate you.<br /><br />Excellent films, and currently the only way for those of us in the United States to get the original film without importing it from Canada.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have seen many versions of Jane Eyre.  For the most part, I find them to be decent.  But this version was beguiling and riveting.  Although, I know the story of Jane and Mr. Rochester, I was simply glued to watching their interactions on screen.<br /><br />It has the right element of sensuality (which personally I have craved for in previous adaptions) without making it ridiculas.<br /><br />Mr. Rochester is stunning in this version.  He is dark yet light and his wit is fantastic!  I love the moments they share on the screen.  Toby Stevens is known for his theatre acting and he does not hold back in this movie.  His facial expressions and eyes speak before he does.  He is engaging and pulls you in with each scene.<br /><br />By far one of my most favorite rainy day movies!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was so caught up in these characters and their lives that I am intrigued as to what their futures did hold for them. Did Cecelia get past how everything effects her and concentrated on Polly's adaptation? Did Rachel move to New York? What about Trudy, the school principal? She is a character worth developing. What did happen to Felicity? Liane- I need more!! Loved the book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Game play is great, but interrupted often so it can load or make some offer to buy something. Also, once the game was initially installed, it needed to go to grab many MBs more of game content before play could begin.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|This movie was supposedly based on a real families experience during the Thailand tsunami. It was a nice tribute to them if it is true.....it shows the resilience of the human spirit in very difficult times. The cinematography really let you experience the terror of mother nature. All round good movie.
B003F46RVO|5.0|A staple for 80's and vampire horror. I wish that today's horror movie producers would go back and take a few notes from movies like this. No cheap pop-outs or horrendous gore--just a great script, great monsters, great direction, and great actors.
B00BUAEYVK|4.0|There are no surprises in this movie but if you enjoy watching Bruce in his typical style you will enjoy this for what it is.

0062059963|4.0|In [[ASIN:0062059963 The Elite (Selection)]], America is over the novelty of being part of The Selection, a contest for determining which of 35 girls will become the next princess of Illea. This is the second in the Selection Trilogy. America is far more strategic and cunning in this chapter, knowing midway through that she does love Prince Maxon and would make a good, compassionate monarch.<br /><br />Her ex-boyfriend Aspen is now a palace guard and has been promoted from a six to a two. This elevated caste would seem to make him more competitive for America's affections, but she has become used to the privileges of court life. America gets a sense of the heavy responsibility before her when rebels and diplomats from other parts both threaten her and vie for her approval.<br /><br />Author Kiera Cass shows maturity in the ongoing trilogy. The Elite is a darker novel, more fact-paced than [[ASIN:0062059947 The Selection]]. Those that have not read the first should start from the beginning, there is no general review for readers picking up the series late. Every worthwhile series has a great cliffhanger, and while this one lacked obvious dramatic flair, it does leave the reader wanting more. 4/5 stars.

0767919408|5.0|Bill Bryson's One Summer is an in-depth account of American innovation, culture, and happenings in 1927. This is narrative nonfiction at its finest. The introduction covers the mostly forgotten history of early aviation in exciting detail. This is a fantastic read for anyone interested in history in general or the pre-war years specifically. American history does not get any better than this. 5/5 stars for high-quality prose and level of detail.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The closing scene (no spoilers here!) cost them a star.  Otherwise, the storyline moved along nicely and we are waiting for season 4, although perhaps not quite as much as if the closing of season 3 was a bit different...

B001ECQ4DA|5.0|I adore this show! I enjoy having the Blu Ray and I put the different seasons on everyday! It has been a long time since I have laughed at a show like this. The pilot it probably one of the best!
B00AALXPN8|4.0|As a highschooler I loved this movie,  the humor and jokes were right on par. But as a parent, I struggle letting my kids watch it until they are a little older.  The movie is laced with hidden innuendos, crude behavior and inappropriate language for a small child.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than Catching Fire because the plot moved forward more smoothly. It didn't blow my mind but I certainly don't regret reading it. It's a fun young adult book with some interesting ideas/themes worth pondering.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I have been putting off reading this book for some time now. With the insistence of my fiancé that this was worth reading (we have different tastes in books, lol), I finally picked it up and finished it.<br /><br />The author does a great job at making the characters so real that you can't help but to be filled with emotion over their journey.  The book did take a little bit for me to get into, but, if you take the time to read it, it's definitely a story you will never forget.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This sequel just feels like a bridge between the first and third book. I could've lived without reading it but my nosiness got the best of me. Still, it kept me engaged so why not?

0061251321|5.0|I received this book as a must read book for my Partnership's retreat and had to pass it along. I then gave it to three of my other colleagues. The book tells insightful stories and represents many of the ethical strategies we have learned and essentially forgot. Working together for the good of the whole in our businesses, families and daily lives creates a much more fulfilling life journey. A must read.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|love it lets go part 2 yea
B0071BY2OG|5.0|If you are a road racer, aspiring road racer, track day enthuisist, or just an everyday rider you will LOVE this video. It is essentially a documentary about the greatest racer to ever grace a track (The Doctor) Val. Rossi. It covers the rise of Jorge Lorenzo and their constant battles.  It also talks about one of Val's greatest rivals Casey Stoner!<br /><br />Recommend seeing FASTER if you have not seen it....

B00B2QG3K2|4.0|I really like this album!  It has a little bit of everything.  It's slightly different from their older stuff, but even old fans will enjoy this.  I'm 30 and even my kids like listening to this album.
B0012PDVQ2|2.0|Ya, ya... I know this movie is all deep and layered with subtext and philosophical context on the human condition... but to me it was just boring.  I dont watch Sci-Fi movies to be deep, I watch them to be entertained.<br /><br />To be fair, I didn't watch this in the 80's even though I was a teenager during that time. I didn't actually watch this until just last month so it probably suffered some in my rating as it is very dated.  But I simply couldn't find myself invested in any of the characters in this movie.  I didn't care if Decker was a replicant, because I didn't care about Decker.  You never see anything about him that makes you want to care.<br /><br />The best role in this movie was Rutger Hauer and he was in like 3 scenes.  I literally fell asleep on my couch watching this movie.  Want an 80's sci-fi movie?  Go watch &#34;The Last Starfighter&#34;, you will thank me.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Will only review this film on Amazon - Netflix has a bunch of babies complaining.  You people who \\"need\\" an uplifting ending - watch \\"Bambi\\" - drama w/a delightful ending.  Grow up - get real.  \\"The Wrestler\\" is stunning - hold your breath time.  One reviewer couldn't get past Mickey not being pretty anymore.  Watch \\"Diner\\" - he's real pretty, but not the actor he will become.  Every film since \\"Diner\\" (were others before?) I've seen.  \\"The Wrestler\\" puts hands around your neck & squeezes - don't pass out - see it to the end.  Can't conceive why EVERYONE needs to \\"spoil\\" it by telling the entire story.<br /><br />A Mickey Rourke fan - all I needed to hear is that it's a totally submerged role for him.  Did his best to make it real - he succeeded in an unearthly way.<br /><br />See \\"The Wrestler\\" if you can deal w/real life & negative endings.  Life is not all pink bubble gum...

B000QCS8TW|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I thought this book was OK.<br />The character set is enormous however, and it is hard to keep the different characters straight.  There are MANY plot-lines and the author makes a habit of jumping from on to another - frequently.  This makes following the character development even more tiresome.<br /><br />What infuriated me however, was that after getting to the end of the book, the book was NOWHERE NEAR FINISHED.<br />I just felt this book was a giant teaser for the next books in the Game of Thrones series.<br /><br />If Mr. Martin wants me to purchase the rest of his books, he needs to provide me with a complete, satisfying read -- think of any book from the Harry Potter series for example.<br />That is what will make me want to purchase more of his work.
B00BY8DNK6|5.0|Was at this show glad the entire thing was put out for all to hear.The greatest stage show of all time on this tour !!! RJD - R.I.P. gone but not forgotten !!!!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app for Facebook for my Kindle Fire is great,have not had any issues. What that means to me is that the amazon . Group have done their homework,once again giving me something I can tell my friends and family about; with that said, they may get or upgrade their Kindel's
B003F3FJQO|5.0|WOW. Wow wow wow wow WOW. If you're looking for an exhilarating thrill ride (and who isn't?), look no further-The Maze Runner Trilogy is one of the most exciting and fast-paced series I've ever read, with such sharp twists in the plot that you'll be just as blind-sided as Thomas. In this second installment, Thomas and the other Gladers are convinced they are safe once they're out of the Maze, only to find themselves thrown out into the Scorch-the desolate, barren wasteland where the sun burns you the second you walk outside and riddled with Cranks. Cranks are people who have contracted a disease called the Flare that eats away at your brain till there is no humanity left, leaving you a crazed, flesh-eating monster (think zombie). Thomas and the Gladers have to make it through the Scorch to get to the safe haven, where they will receive the cure to the Flare, which they have all contracted. Behind all of this is the WICKED corporation, but can WICKED be trusted? Can anyone? I finished this book at two in the morning and immediately bought and read 17% of The Death Cure, the final book in the trilogy. These are impossible books to put down, and the cliff hangers will have you scrounging for the next book, searching for resolutions to the questions you're left with. I kept telling myself that I'd stop reading and go to bed as soon as I was done reading my current chapter, but before I knew it I was reading the one after that and the one after that-these books leave you with an insatiable hunger for more. One of the best books I've read-5/5 stars ;)
B000VMFDW2|5.0|If you watched \\"The Pacific\\" you owe yourself to read this book. It's like the show but a lot more grim and no Hollywood cliche stuff. The book is from Eugene's point of view of the gruesome world he was surrounded in during WW2 full of sadness, anger, fear and pride. This is the kind of book schools should require kids to read its great American history of our forgotten pacific warriors.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I thought this movie was actually pretty funny, there are a few swear words in it so I wouldn't recommend it for smaller children.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|I loved Flowers for Algernon. What a sad yet wonderful story. I could barely put this book down. Definitely five stars.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The most enjoyable thing about Downton Abbey is the dynamics between the upstairs, lords and ladies, and the downstairs staff, cooks, maids, butler, etc. Really fun watching the two classes deal with every day problems. Personally I like the downstairs staff the best.
B007L6VR12|5.0|All of Wes Anderson's films are excellent, but this one is one of my favorites. As always, it's visually stimulating, has great dialogue, and a strong story. The DVD contains some extras, and behind the scenes footage. It was also nice to see some different actors being used, as opposed to his usual cast (Bill Murray etc.), which I still enjoy.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|When I received a Kindle as a gift, I purchased this cover - almost 2 years ago  People always ask me where I got it because it is slimmer than many others.  It keeps the Kindle clean & protected.  It does not really stand up very well (as shown in the pictures), but that's not what I use it for.  This product has exceed my expectations.
6304711905|5.0|This is the best depiction of the events leading up to and following the most brazen  gunfight in the &#34;Old West&#34;. The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Kurt Russell as the steely-eyed Earp, and Val Kilmer as the no-nonsense ice in the blood gambler/gunfighter. I can watch it over and over.
B0068MNO4S|4.0|Anonymous offers us a colorful and dramatically potent picture of the &#34;Oxfordian&#34; theory, in answer to the question, &#34;Who really wrote Shakespeare?&#34;  Taking its cue from those contrarian books that assert the true author to have been Edward DeVere, the 17th Earl of Oxford, the film then proceeds to undercut its credibility by playing fast and loose with the stream of events, including side trips into wild speculation about Queen Elizabeth's having given birth, in secret, to some of the film's principal characters.<br /><br />The end result is a production that must frustrate the serious historian and confuse the casual observer.  But, if this motion picture tickles the curiosity of enough of those casual observers to the point that they research the authorship controversy for themselves (with more restraint than the film's screen-writers have shown), then perhaps Anonymous will have done more good than harm.

B005DJREGQ|5.0|I watched the first episode just to see what the reviews had been raving above on amazon prime. Funny, hip, and with comic insight into the awkward, uncoordinated, mortifying world of high school teens, Recommended for adults and soon-to-be adults who want to reinforce their laugh and life skills against the world.

B001YIJOI6|3.0|The first time I've heard that name was the song &#34;Audue&#34; from the second CD. I decided to get the debut CD as well because love her second one. I think it's not as polished as her second one but its' a matter of taste (and i must admit i don't speak French so have no clue what she is singing, so its purely music that i like).<br />Try it yourself.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly addictive and lots of fun to play. Who doesn't love minions? If you like the Despicable Me movies you will enjoy this game. A word of caution though once you start playing it's hard to stop. At least for me it was. I highly recommend. :)

B00006CXXU|5.0|Stripped is a versatile, artistic statement. It hops genres ranging from Hip-hop, R&B, Progressive Rock, Flamenco, Soul, Pop, Pop/Rock and even Folk. That may sound like too much, but for the most part, it works.<br /><br />&#34;Walk Away&#34; is a gorgeous, bluesy ballad about falling victim to addiction, and seeking a way out. The Flamenco-infused &#34;Infatuation&#34; is a sexy, sassy, exciting song that would've worked well as a single. Neo-Soul ballad &#34;Loving Me 4 Me&#34; blends captivating lyrics, an engaging chorus, Christina's gorgeous voice at its most gentle, and even a spoken poem, all solidly backed by soulful grooves and the album's best drums.<br /><br />&#34;Cruz&#34; is another standout track. The vocal delivery is breathtaking. &#34;Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze/tongue-tied and twisted are all my memories,&#34; she sings. It's a must-listen ballad. &#34;Get Mine, Get Yours&#34; and &#34;Dirrty&#34; are Pop/Hip-hop numbers that offer a lot of sexiness, hooks, and gratification reminiscent of Madonna. Singles &#34;The Voice Within&#34; and &#34;Beautiful&#34; are ballads in top form - musically, lyrically, and vocally.<br /><br />Stripped was one of the most exciting albums of the 2000's. One of the best coming of age records I've heard. If you haven't heard it too, I highly recommend it.
0345525558|5.0|Excellent story and well written with characters I really cared about. The flower glossary at the back of the book was a wonderful bonus.

B00CEF014E|4.0|DISCLAIMER: I was asked by the author to download this eBook when it was free and write a review for it.  My review remains completely unbiased.<br /><br />I've read many thrillers where at the end of the story a twist is thrown at the reader that one of the characters is mentally disabled so badly that he or she has created multiple fictitious personas and has been acting them out for the length of the story.  That honestly is what I expected \\"Solstice\\" to be: just another story about a schizophrenic girl who had a fake boyfriend that would go missing before chaos would ensue.  Oh wow.  This story is so much more.  In fact, it's a bucket full of crazy twists and turns that may get a bit too drastic near the end of the book, leading to a somewhat ridiculously well tied up conclusion.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />STORY - After checking herself into rehab for her depression and being treated for a few days, Dana is finally ready to visit her sister and introduce her new boyfriend to her.  On her way to the cult-like camp her sister lives in, Dana stops at a set of cabins with her boyfriend, Tyler.  The night is full of arguments and come morning, Tyler has abandoned Dana leaving only his unregistered car and a few of his belongings.  Frustrated, Dana sets off to visit her sister solo but begins to think that Tyler's disappearance may be less than voluntary.  With the police department beginning to think that Tyler doesn't even exist, Dana sets out to find the truth behind Tyler's disappearance and the cult she is now staying with.<br /><br />WRITING STYLE - Firstly, let me comment that Mr. Stevenson's writing is almost completely devoid of typos.  Sure, there are a few incorrect punctuation marks and a misplaced clause or two if you want to get really picky, but overall, the writing is extremely professional and what one would expect from any noteworthy author.<br /><br />The plot progression occasionally moved a bit too fast but mostly continued at the perfect rate.  The backstory had enough time to be set up, as did occasional flashbacks that were rarely located in the story.<br /><br />In fact, the only major complaint I have about the story is that the ending is just a bit too cheesy for me.  Without giving anything away, the last 1/4 of the story has so many people running around accomplishing ridiculous feats that it becomes a bit on the level a teenage horror film.  Still, I did find myself reading faster and faster as the tense scenes escalated.<br /><br />The character development was not really a negative aspect of the book, but it did leave a little to be desired.  There were so many names thrown at the reader that weren't really integral parts of the plot apart from a few minutes of action, and it became just a tiny bit confusing to keep them all straight.  Like I said, they weren't really influencing the story's outcome that much, though, so it really wasn't a huge deal to know the difference between Michael and Mike.<br /><br />WARNINGS - Language, Violence, Sexual Insinuations<br /><br />OVERALL - Is this short book worth a buy?  With it being a bit cheesy and only lasting about 30-45 minutes to get through, perhaps not at the original list price of four dollars.  If you can pick it up for a buck or two, though, then you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this twisted thriller of a tale.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great flick. Super origional. Keeps me interested in what's going on, and still not hard to follow. Oh and another thing that catches me about shows on TV is how predictable they can be, where as this one throws you for loops. Awesome!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Very  disappointed with the ending......you think its a sifi thriller with action and magic and underneath also a love story...but its not
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I could not wait for this game to finally hit the Appstore.  When I got to play I couldn't believe how different it was. The farther you go the freakier it gets. By freaky I mean way to much fun and frustration. Just my cup of tea. I have to give one cool clue up. When you start playing .......Just have Fun.  Ha!  Drywallady can kick it in all Quell' s.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|Fabulous series, I can't get enough. Gideon Cross makes my heart melt and is perfection. I'm in love with it all!
0345529057|4.0|It took about 2.5 weeks for me to get it. And when I got it the corners were kind of bashed in.<br />It was deliverd in a cardbord box with no padding in a sack without padding aswell.<br /><br />The books are looking kind of smooshed (on the edges) but it still provides good reading.
B005544V6A|5.0|We were looking for a new series after watching Orange is the New Black, so my friend recommended Suits. I was a little leary...a show about lawyers recommended by a financial planner;)  After watching the first episode we were hooked!  With the first season down I can't wait to start season two.  Not looking forward to being caught up and having to wait a week in between shows though!
B00005RHGL|5.0|I especially like the way in which the goodbye scene between Doc and Kate gives some closure to the relationship, explaining why she is not with him in Colorado at the end. Also, the scene between McMasters and the Cowboys finally explains his sudden appearance as a dead body!
B00957T6X6|5.0|GEORGE R R MARTIN IS A GENIUS!!!!<br /><br />Hands down this was a fantastic set to own. I was torn between waiting the days it took to re-stock to get the psychical copy or get the e book. I think I made the right choice and gave in and got the 5 book set on the kindle! I was very pleased with the detail and people and places and everything. It was just a great engaging in-depth read. I personally am not only a fan of the book but the T.V. Show and am very happy with both. I can not wait till the 6th book comes out<br />&#34;The winds of winter&#34; is making me crazy with anticipation
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was one of my first serious books and it has left an lasting impression on me and it was an ease to read not because  it was written in a simple manner ,but because it was so well written and thought  out that I just flew thought it . I am 16 so relating the the character wasn't hard . This was the first book of yours I have read , but it won't be my last
0930289234|5.0|I grew up on comics and comic book characters. But this is a read that I can go back and re-read and never get tired of its just that good. This is a must for any comic book lover!!! I know this is a short review and I am sorry but the story sells itself it's that FREAKIN GOOD!!!
B003Y3ZTGA|3.0|A wonderful artist that is extremely talented and an awesome entertainer.  While my little girl loves \\"Fireworks\\", used in Madagascar 3, I won't let hear listen to any of the explicit songs.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App looks great, but it is useless without the ability to save images. Please fix or provide better technical support.
B000I9U76A|3.0|Grandchildren said ok but no interest in ever seeing again.  Too many words, not enough action according to the 10 year old.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Grout had some moments of clarity and serious consideration of her subject. But in her evident need to prove she wasn't too spiritual, she overshot humor and landed in 'too cool for school'. I truly wish she understood humor as something amusing and not something you do when you are trying to impress or put yourself on a level with someone you think is not quite as savvy as you. Her subject is fascinating.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I had read the book and found the movie to re-create the story well.  Impressive visual effects.  Would definitely recommend it.
B006PAV1XO|1.0|If Dazed and Confused sucked, it would be this movie.  Bill Hader and Christin Wiig are the only decent part of this movie and they have less than 10mins of screen time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The wonderfully drawn characters and the storyline keeps me coming back for every episode. Really just a great show. I highly recommend it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|By far one of the best shows on the air.  It is great fun to watch them all in a row on Amazon.  You need a strong wifi signal!  Third season is currently on Tuesday nights at 10pm. Don't miss!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The wonderfully drawn characters and the storyline keeps me coming back for every episode. Really just a great show. I highly recommend it.
B00422LESO|4.0|It seriously is a girl thing, Colin Forth swimming in the lake. This book was like watching that scene over an  over again. I am certainly jealous of the main character because what fun would it be to live a Jane Austen novel. Off to watch P&P!
1400069807|5.0|Just finished this book and it's one of those books where once you're finished, the next time you open up your pantry you'll either be disgusted with yourself or nod your head in agreement at what a good job the large food corporations have done.<br /><br />This isn't a book lecturing you about how bad salt/sugar/fat is for you, but rather a detailed look at how food corporations manipulate salt/sugar/fat so that when you stick something in our mouth it tastes delicious and makes you want more.  The science of how these products are made and the marketing of such products to the consumer is what the core of the book is about.  While the general assumption is that salt/sugar/fat in excess is unhealthy, the author doesn't go into scientific detail about how these effect the human body, but does cover just how much the food corporations rely on salt/sugar/fat to make their products hit the &#34;bliss point&#34; for the human palate.  There's a reason why everyone has that favorite snack/junk food item that they crave, that always finds a way into their mouth on road trips or at the movie theater.  Reading this book will help you understand why.<br /><br />This book will definitely make you take a more critical look at what you buy at the supermarket, how you found yourself drawn to certain products, and maybe change some of your buying habits for the better.  Worth a read if your diet is heavy on processed/packaged food, required reading if you do the shopping for the family where you're feeding processed/packaged food for children.
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|I saw the Movie & then got the cd  music. liked it. Listen to it often. Brings back lots of good memories.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app used to work perfectly. Now, not so much. Will not save edited pic to phone. You can screengrab your pic, but it's a pain in the app. Get Photo Editor from the play store. So much better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good fun and the app is free so it's even better.  Some challenges are very easy and a few are tough.
3836538725|5.0|I am an avid collector of art books, and Sabastiao Salgado's Genesis is the most welcome addition to my collection. I am not sure this was one of this incredibly gifted photographer's intention, but the book had a most humbling effect on me. Hardly imaginable beauty surrounds the reader of this book as you go page by page. As most of us will doubtfully be able to see it all in real life, we should be eternally grateful to Mr. Salgado for bringing it to us with such pristine precision. The book is a masterpiece! My only minute reservation is in the fact that when the photograph is presented on two side by side pages, the centerfold of the book slightly distorts the view of it. Still, all in all, this book is a treasure, and I feel very-very fortunate to have it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Loved every second of this season! It is such an amazing way to get to watch your favorite seasons at the rate that you want! Thanks amazon prime!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I built a computer with the AMD FX-8350, 4 GHZ 8 Core processor and the EVGA GeForce GTX 66 2048MB GDDR5 Video card. The computer has 8Gbs of G-Skill RipJaw X-series RAM. The computer is completely stable and operates very fast. This is a great motherboard.

6305308659|5.0|This film has always been one of my favorites and I was glad to find it here-on the surface, it is a simple tale of two teens caught in the past, but on deeper levels, this film talks about inspiration, going for dreams, and the perils of prejudice.<br />I highly recommend it for everyone
0394804406|5.0|hard to find, classic book by a great designer - gave as a gift  - recipient really seemed to love it
B000002VSN|5.0|Whitney Houston was one of my favorite singers.  It was a terrible tragedy that she had to leave us at such a young age. The CD was received in a timely manner and was in good condition.
3836528347|4.0|Quite a wonderful stroll down memory lane!  I would recommend this to any fan of the atomic age!  I don't think anything of our current era quite compares.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Excellent photo application.  Working as described, lots of great features, and it saves fine on my Samsung Galaxy S3. Recommend you check this one out!
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I love this AP it's easy to use, the demonstration is great, makes working out very easy, to follow plus u can pause
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I never knew that our average teenage was this smart.  They certainly think of things I never thought of when I was that age.  The story was very  touching and certainly appropriate for our society today where cancer know no age limit.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|In love this it gets harder as u go but that's good get the game now. (: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am right believe me
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I loved this game!  Some of the balls really tested my patience but perserverance prevailed!  My only complaint, it was done at 44 balls.  I want more!
B008AVXGA2|5.0|First of all, I have to say that this is an exciting undertaking. There is an entire treasure trove of characters and stories and adventures in the Russian lore that deserve a wider recognition and a modern representation. Author Jula Gousseva does exactly that by bringing to life two very memorable characters of the Russian folklore - the Firebird (Jarptitsa in Russian) and Baba Yaga - the originial rock star witch with a twisted sense of humor and a nice little house with human skulls decorating the fence. Into the mix, Julia throws two kids who serve as our protagonists and guides into the magical kingdom of the childhood lost. Read this book to your kid and read it to yourself and feel the distant echo of your childhood gently saying: \\"Follow the light...follow the light\\"
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|For Neil this is middle-of-the-road -- which is to say, very good but not on a par with his best work. Think Neverwhere, not American Gods. The plot is covered elsewhere, but the tone is right for a minor work. The obvious developments, such as the triune goddess, are (appropriately) treated as a matter of course, not as a surprise. The presentation of the narrator as an un-self-aware novelist is rather precious. All in all, well worth while, but not as special as I've come to expect from Gaiman.
B00BESM14U|3.0|The character are stereotypical of unsupervised rich white kids, and the dialog is equally predictable. Not a terrible movie, but it won't be memorable for any reason.
078322799X|4.0|Old movies we watch on Halloween as the neighborhood children vivsit for their treats, we like it alot thanks for the deal.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's and I love to listen to the soothing melodies on my way home from work.
B008HFWF3U|3.0|Enough of the Orchestrion! It doesn't have the nuance of a real band. it's soulless and takes the emotion out of Pat's music. It's stripped down Metheny.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Got this for my Nexus 4 and it would not load. Tried restarting my phone after installation, but it wouldn't ever go beyond the \\"Loading\\" page\\".
B006GECE9Y|4.0|It was the solution to the painful: flash player required. I can easily watch family video clips, instead of missing out.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|When using this product with Streets and Trips it works very well when you  have a lot of stops to make. It puts them in order and you just go from one to the next.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This  has a good story line about the class system in England that in some ways is still in practice.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game if you love MLP! Must have a lot of patience. My 6 yr old loves it! Lots and lots of fun!<br />l
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|I have spent 2 days trying to get the pulse to connect to my Withings scale.<br />I will now try to disconnect my scale and start all over.<br />If unsuccessful I will contact customer service about returning the pulse.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good read easy to like and action paced! If you like the tv show it is a good was to get some background information on the characters
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I can't wait for the next season.  As in previous seasons the daily lives of both the Crawly's and thier staff is never dull.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am chiropractic assistant and have been recommending this book to all of our patients.  What a life change, I also have the cookbook, the food is yummy and easy to make.
1781162646|5.0|I loved this book. No, it's not typically what you'd expect from Stephen King. No there are no monsters or aliens, and even the ghostly presences in the book won't be what you'd expect. That being said, the book was excellent. My favorite scene in the book is the final scene. The part where you get to see a special little boy get his wish. I don't cry at movies or books (the closest I've come in the Harry Potter series where Rowling killed Dobby. I still haven't quite forgiven her for that)but it the final scene of Joyland doesn't bring  tear to your eye, you're not quite human. If you enjoy a ghostly crime story, the you'll love this book. I highly recommend it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Could not put the books down.  I can not wait until the next book in series comes out.  I am thinking I should have waited until all books were available.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app. Does what i need it to. Makes my pics look wild and funky. Exactly what i was looking for.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put the books down.  I can not wait until the next book in series comes out.  I am thinking I should have waited until all books were available.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love love love this game!! I completely wish I had minions of my own. They're just so freaking cute!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good game, makes you think. Definitely a good time wasting game. I like all the different levels and different ways to play
B000007MVD|5.0|A grea t blast from the past.Love all the songs and energy.But in typical fashion unlike the bootlegs all the chatter from the radio show is gone.This Wings Over America you know it live but the feel isn't there.But this is well worth having and has a song or two they never performed before or since.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is a fun game that can be confusing at time and your always earning money at any time of day
B003Y8YXGC|5.0|I like this when it was first released all those years ago.But time has made this better.John voice is timeless the songs are great from Mind Games to Meat City it all works.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Quickly paced, with many Awkward moments, .<br />While the story line is often predictable the show overcomes it with fresh actors and many memorable one liners.
B004WJREMW|5.0|This why he is Paul McCartney.This is very experiemental album.From a great Blues piece On the Way to Coming Up to electronic 80's Temporary Secretary.This one has lasted and well worth adding to your collection.
B00AL6SM0S|5.0|This contains some wonderful historic artifacts that I'm exceptionally grateful for the Met having made available. (Thank-you yet again to Peter Gelb). But there are too many &#34;vintage mono&#34; recordings from the 30s and 40s rather than the 50s and 60s to be able to call it a true listening pleasure. The broadcasts from the 50s and 60s fare much better. I sure hope the companion set, &#34;Verdi at the Met,&#34; is much heavier on later broadcasts and leaves the earlier ones for the music scholars to study.
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|This is very overlooked and a great collection of John's songs.Bless you is as sturring a Julia.Old Dirt Road is majestic,Steel and Glass about Allen Klien is another How do you Sleep.This a true treasure of some of John's best songs.
B003MAQM6Q|1.0|I did not have Mary Jane around and thus this movie left me irritated and confused.<br />You might like it.  I found it boring.
B000007MVU|5.0|Long before Linda Ronstadt and very long before Rod Stewart decided he would massacre the old standards.Ringo's first offering is a wonderful jesture to his Mother and he did so very well.This was my first time hearing any of these songs and I really appreciated how well written they were and Ringo does a great job on vocals.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|My high hopes for the Chromecast were dashed almost immediately. It doesn't communicate well with my Droid Bionic. This appears to be a common issue with the Bionic and some other smart phone models. I was unable to set up the device via the Chromecast app on my phone and the \\"Cast\\" button is unavailable in my Netflix app. Once I finally got it set up via my laptop I attempted to control the device via my Samsung Galaxy tab. Again problems. When I tried to cast out of Netflix I repeatedly got an error that the content I was trying to cast was unavailable. After resetting the Chromecast the problem went away and I was able to operate the device off of my tablet. However, when streaming Netflix through the Chromecast I did not get as clear of a picture as I did when I stream via other devices such as Roku, Wii, Blue Ray player, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it just seemed buggy.<br /><br />The only feature that really worked well right out of the box was the ability to cast the Chrome browser to my TV from my Macbook. That's pretty cool.
034580404X|5.0|I wanted these books but didn't want to pay too much and i didn't the price was awesome cant put them down and delivery was fast came in two days after ordering expected it to be on time but it was early
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I loved the movie, but more.... I loved watching behind the scenes and what an incredible job Dustin Hoffman did directing. Such energy, such positive kindness. If I could be directed by him, I would go after my life long dream to act. I love this man, he has a true heart of gold! Oh, and the actors were the best synergy I have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman is a fallen Angel from Heaven!!!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|What a great book.<br /><br />It makes you think of what it means exactly to be human, and get you emotionally involved with ever character.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Purchased this box for my Dad's birthday. He's a huge Beatles enthusiast and was stoked to get this box as a gift. These records sound GREAT! We were all impressed. So much that we all sat down and listened to a few of the records front to back. Somethign no one does much of these days. It's a must have for any Beatles fan.
B007N0REX6|5.0|fantastic album<br />all great songs from anastasia to the title track apocalyptic love<br />slash&#34;s guitar and the great rock voice of Myles Kennedy rock this album
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|There is no way of earning coins besides paying real money for them. Also everything vost 800 coins or more. Rated 3 stsrs due to vosting the player too much money. No longer playing game, since there is no goal!!!
B000M4RG42|1.0|This item shipped fast and i liked that but when it arrived The movie skipped for about 30 minutes and I had to fast toward through it.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Love all the songs on the album!  Amazing lyrics and strong arrangements.  Radioactive is the best song...should be on a movie soundtrack
B00005B1W7|4.0|Years ago I enjoyed this micro-series on TV... Seeing it again only updated my opinions about the presentation... Of course I'd recommend it to those fascinated with social interactions and a time in history where mankind was more than a little demented...
B0050PYNOY|3.0|Could be funnier but it came when they said it would and eventhough it's not that great of a movies.  I have to admit I've watched more than once.
B002M9WW30|4.0|I can't say I really notice that much difference between this bluray set and the DVD set I already owned. It is nice however to have Rocky Balboa included in the bluray set. The packaging is nice, and I really prefer to have bluray as hey are smaller and easier to keep. Price was great also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|More realistic than the other horse game app that I had ..cool audio while training and competing  love the sound of the hoof beats<br /> Fun entertaining
0062255657|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a great entry point into fantasy literature that seeks to be a metaphor for life. It is not subtle about its role as metaphor. It describes an adult's memories of being a seven  year old boy in a world that is not always friendly. But the book asserts that the best way to understand the feeling of this world is to understand the world as full of fantastic and magical creations.  I suspect this short book will be eventually regarded as a classic.<br />The book is full of passages that can and will be quoted. Life lessons can come from magical creations. Two example quotations give some of the feeling of the book:<br /> \\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. Truth is, there aren't any grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.\\"<br /><br />\\"And did I pass?\\" The face of the old woman on my right was unreadable in the gathering dusk. On my left the younger woman said, \\"You don't pass or fail at a being a person, dear.\\"
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I would love to see this made into an (English version) movie.  I predict it would be a big hit.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|What a beautiful story of a boy and his struggle to survive this disaster in high seas with a Tiger!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|5/5 recommended. If you want a cool game get this game it's a cool game. The only bad thing is that you have to review it to get more guns.
0452295548|5.0|This book is amazing for understanding what happens to the brain from a stroke whichever kind you have had.  I had an aneurysm and miraculously was not severely damaged from the event.  I have issues in my thinking and processing that were changed overnight.  This has been hard to deal with for me and my children.  This book has given us the encouragement and understanding to help develop the pathways to heal the brain damage.  A very important book for caregivers and survivors.  Tools to regain our lives.
0060763280|5.0|My story will be to be continued but following the advice given and really a awesome read.  I would put it up there with the classic &#34;Think and Grow Rich&#34;.......
B009K916ZK|5.0|I have had several of the non-Apple adapters fail. That is really painful when I am somewhere trying to give a talk and can't get my slides to show. I have never had an Apple one fail. Not a very large sample, but the Apple adapters feel more solid and I think it is worth the difference.
B003K16P3M|4.0|It's a good book, I like it.<br />It shows what most people are afraid now a days, I'm scared to show my feeling to people and I keep it all bottled up. Katsa is very protective of her feeling. I know most girls who are like that.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Alec's performance was legendary.  Even his nod to a line he'd later use in his role as a old Jedi warrior.
0316228583|5.0|With 3806 reviews already posted, there isn't much more that can be said.  My comment:  the book is brilliant!  I expected to like it, I wanted to like it, but found myself struggling at the beginning, not sure what was going on and disappointed. Then, things started falling into place and I realized suddenly how cleverly the characters and plot were being fed to me and everything started to make sense.  Yes, I agree that it could be considered a dark comedy but it isn't a pretty book.  Get rid of your expectations before reading this book because this book is something different.  The writing is superb.  There were times where, after reading a passage, I had to stop and read the passage several times aloud marveling at how those plain and innocuous words could be assembled in such a manner as to create such powerful expression.  I loved it.  I am impressed.  I look forward to more of the same.
B00E8B1358|4.0|I know that the haters like to criticize this movie.  But we rented this for a family movie night and the kids LOVED it.  It was non-stop action.  Acting?  We don't need to stinking acting!  It kept the kids, and my self glued to the screen the whole time for some fun escapism.  If that isn't the mark of a good movie, I don't know what is.
B000FC0V3E|3.0|I try, I really try but I can't see what the supposed genius of Hemingway is all about - unless it's an ability to recite street names and repeat the same statement in the space of a paragraph.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|As a former fan in the 70's, I followed the California Sound. I also lived in LA. As teenagers, we actually founded where one of the band members lived!<br /><br />Anyway, I found the \\"grown-up adults\\" Eagles perspectives take on their history together interesting.  I was sad to see that they got rid of Don Felder and so called, \\"cut a deal\\" where the two leaders thought it would be fair that they got more money going into their future careers. I guess Glenn and Don had what Keith Richards called, Mick Jagger in his book, \\"Life\\". \\"LSS\\", \\"Lead Singer Syndrome\\".<br /><br />Kudos to Joe Walsh for getting this life together.<br /><br />I am also floored that they cut a deal with Walmart, the worst company on the planet. As activists, they should be ashamed of themselves.  Don Henley was quoted as saying, \\"they are a getting to be a greener company\\".  He lied straight to the camera.  They don't pay their employees well, no benefits and they do not support unions.  All their money goes into lawsuits and if they focused on better issues like the above mentioned things, then they wouldn't be in constant legal brawls. In a documentary about Walmart, it was said that they encourage their employees to go on public assistance. I think that is illegal. I wonder if any of the Eagles actually shop there?<br /><br />I support Target.<br /><br />That being said, I think Hotel California is still one of their greatest albums.
B008ILPJTK|5.0|I am about the pickiest reviewer you will find when it comes to music.  Prog is the only genre in modern music that really interests me.  I have been hooked on Prog-metal since DT released \\"Dream and Day\\" in 1989.  For may years it was DT and only DT and my music appreciation outlook consisted of waiting for the next DT album - and hoping it was a good one.  Recently it seems that there has been a massive resurgence of excellent progressive music with standouts including Porcupine Tree/Steve Wilson, Haken, The Mystery, DeeExpus Project, and others.  There is just something that separates the good prog bands for the great ones.  It's hard to put your finger on but with some of these bands the complexity, which should just flow naturally, feels contrived...forced - almost as if the musicians are sitting there thinking to themselves \\"this isn't proggy enough, let's throw some extra notes and off time passages in here to make it sound more complicated.\\"  You just never get that feeling from CM.  Every song is just beautifully composed with intricate, flowing passages, and never that awkward moment where you feel like there is complexity for the sake of complexity alone.  All three albums are outstanding but I think this debut album is the tops, with title track \\"The First Chapter\\" possibly vying for top prog-metal piece of all time.  I don't even really know the band members that well yet but you would have to think that the guitarist has been training under Petrucci for years and years.  I'm pretty sure he could just step right in and take over for him on any given day - yes, it's just that good.  The rest of the band are no slouches either.  The vocals are somewhat of a cross between LaBrie and Jeff Tate.  Fortunately the Tate'ishness is enough to offset the LaBrie sound and the vocals are overall excellent.  If you enjoy DT you just can not possibly dislike CM.  The similarities are sometimes at the point of raising an eyebrow and thinking maybe I heard that before in a DT album, but the 95% of the rest of it is just unbelievably good prog-metal.  Go for it.n a DT album, but the 95% of the rest of it is just unbelievably good prog-metal.  Go for it.
B000OXHRRC|2.0|I'm a fan of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe and wanted to like this film.  But as one reviewer put it, this movie seems to have been an excuse for both of them to hang out in France.  This is simply a mediocre film - the kind you walk away from to take care of something without pausing, because you simply don't care about it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After viewing the movie Searching for Sugarman, I could not wait to hear more of Rodriguez's beautiful music.  If you want to listen to songs that really mean something by an artist whose haunting voice will get under your skin, buy this CD.
B004B32500|5.0|Santa Sangre (Alexandro Jodorowsky, 1989)<br />[originally posted 3Apr2000]<br /><br />I'm not sure I have the language to describe this film. Room is being made on my 100-best list for it as we speak. [ed. Note: as of this writing--13Aug2013--it sits at #11.] I was stunned, astounded, left with my mouth hanging open. Okay, so I'm usually more fooled by the twist ending than most people, and that may be the case again here, but... wow.<br /><br />Fenix (Jodorowsky's son Axel) is a young man confined to a mental institution after witnessing the gruesome mutilation of his mother, Concha (Blanca Guerra) by his father, Orgo (Guy Stockwell-- yes, he's Dean's brother) after Concha catches Orgo with another woman (Thelma Tixou). After committing the disfigurement, Orgo kills himself. Fenix is witness to all this, and we see it in an extended flashback. As well, Fenix is falling in love with Alma, who's the daughter of the other woman-- and so, when the other woman flees, she takes Alma with her.<br /><br />The present, in movie time, is twelve years afterwards. While on an outing with others from the institution, Fenix happens to see the other woman in a crowd of prostitutes, and the next morning, his mother comes to see him at the institution, and effects his escape. His mother, who is without arms thanks to his father, uses Fenix's arms in order to exact revenge. And it only gets weirder from there.<br /><br />Many people seem to consider Santa Sangre a horror film. I'm not exactly sure why this is. There are elements of the horror film in it, but there are just as many elements of other genres (most notable psychodrama and black comedy, but others as well). In the end, it's pretty much unclassifiable, and that's much of the reason the film works as well as it does; it's impossible to pin down, lending even more to the atmosphere of disjointedness, \\"otherness,\\" that the events themselves open up.<br /><br />The casting is immaculate, even if it does show the hand of nepotism inherent in Jodorowsky's films. Axel looks like a demented cross between Alexandro himself and Bronson Pinchot, and is at his best when playing his role as \\"less is more.\\" Jodorowsky has that seemingly rare gift of being able to say more with facial expression than with words, and he does it quite capably here. Guerra, Stockwell, and Tixou all perform exceptionally well. But ultimately, it is Axel Jodorowsky and the stunning Sabrina Dennison-- in her only film role, as the adult Alma--who carry this film.<br /><br />Love it or hate it, it is impossible to walk away from this film unaffected. See it at your earliest opportunity, and go to whatever lengths you need to. It's that good. *****tism inherent in Jodorowsky's films.

B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Season 2 carries water for the series. Not as engaging as the first and clearly teeing up the next, I hope.
159420411X|5.0|Terrific book for kids graduating high school - I have given it as a present to my nieces and nephews to encourage them to take statistics in college, which everybody should do.  As good an accessible (i.e., you don't have to have taken a statistics course to read it) book as I have ever seen.
B000W04S6U|5.0|This album takes me back. Relive your favorite missions while coding, running, or cleaning up around the house. Have to mow the lawn, put on One Final Effort and attack the day!
B007D2XSW0|3.0|The main thing I wish this app had would be an option for selective adjustment to brighten up just the darker areas for example. I'll probably continue to use Snapseed for most of my adjustments, but I can see ways of having some fun with the stickers provided in this app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed this the most of the 3 Hosseini books (all as audiobooks). Great story and characters, and beautifully written. About two thirds of the way through, the flow was interrupted by 2 long chapters on less important characters/themes (in my view). But it came together beautifully at the end.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very challenging and fun at the same time. The different maps keeps it fresh and interesting. Great game! Highly recommended.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Very simple intuitive interface, nothing fancy, but great for checking kids homework quickly.  I highly recommend.  xxx. xxxx. xxx. xxxx. xxx
B005ES1D40|4.0|My first crocs.  Extremely comfortable!  Bought them to wear to the pool, but ended up using them a lot this summer.  Highly recommend.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is awesome. I could not stop, I watched the first 3 seasons in a week. Now I can't wait for the other seasons to move to the prime eligible section so I can watch for free. I didn't think the title was so entriguing, but the show is!!!!!
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|Didn't think much from the trailer but was highly recommended by friends so I decided to give it a try. Was very pleasantly surprised by a great original movie. A superb mashup of action, superhero, and teen/dark comedy. Looking forward to the sequel now.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan makes learning about Greek and Roman history fun. The stories of the gods are enlightening and entertaining. I liked all of it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A fabulously woven story from multiple perspectives. I truly enjoy seeing what life in Afghanistan has been/is for different groups of people even if the overall story is fiction.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|The NFC Tags are cool.<br />What are they?  They are small devices with an NFC sensor and you can program certain instructions. Once you tap your phone to them, they will execute the instructions.<br /><br />These NTAG203 from WhizTags are absolutely delightful. First they are colorful and not boring. My daughter was curious, what are these. Now she keeps tagging and wants to tap the phone always. I have one at office desk and which reduces media volume, notification, ringer volume and puts phone to vibrate. I used these tags with a Unlocked Samsung Galaxy S4. I have one in car which increases all volume to maximum, opens a NAVIGON app. For enabling GPS, you need a rooted device, so I do through NAVIGON app. I used NFC Task Launcher. There are other NFC task launchers too. NFC task launcher is very customizable. Remember the days you wrote first program and the excitement when computer could sort numbers, do complex calculations. NFC tags achieve same effect on mobile phones.<br /><br />You can have a task to toggle as part of second tap. I prefer separate tags for separate actions. Home also I have a tag to increase volumes and turn brightness as needed. I have several colorful tags are various locations and this is a great conversation geeky piece too! Have one inside your wallet and knock your phone to wallet to do certain actions! There are limitless possibilities of using these WhizTags. Highly recommend!
B00C8USQEM|5.0|LOVE IT!  Just gonna have to wait for the next &#34;several&#34; in a row to acquire.  Then, all will be perfect!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I enjoyed the several episodes I watched and will be watching more as time permits. Very entertaining and light hearted!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I can't get enough of this game. The graphics are great and my friends and I play together all the time.
0824835921|5.0|Was a very good, unconventional way of learning written Japanese. The writer was easy to understand and the format of the book well layed out. This self teaching book would be best suited towards people that are learning Japanese because they want to rather than those who are taking classes.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|The book contains more detail and back story than the TV show (obviously, it has a lot more space to work with!) - I found it very helpful for understanding some of the more subtle plot points from the show.
0470913029|5.0|I've only been on the Paleo Diet for about two weeks now but love the program.  I'm not hungry, sluggish, which helps staying compliant.
B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|Mavis Stapes is a always a treat, and this offering is especially rousing.  She takes you back to the source.
0812982622|3.0|Fascinated with this period, but this is so dense that I can't get into it.  I will probably read it eventually, but for casual reading, it is difficult.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|I didn't think I would like this retelling of a classic. But it was well done. Although Barnabas was noble, he was still a vampire and he proved it several times. I thought it was an entertaining movie and I hope they make a sequel.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This DVD was a birthday present for my husband. While we have not looked at all of the features yet, we are thrilled with the DVD.<br />The video was beautiful on our large TV. And, the full opening shots that we haven't seen since it was in the theatre were over the moon.<br />Gorgeous DVD<br />Very happy to have it in our &#34;movie library&#34;!
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|Love this movie. Actors did wonderful job bringing the story to the big screen. It inspired my next photoshoot project.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|New puppy chewed original one, therefore had to order a new one. Lost it on vacation, so had to order again! Feeling jinxed!
1451695195|4.0|I signed up for a class regarding this book.  We had great discussions and insights.  The book provided interesting information we hadn't read before.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|This is an excellent continuation of our beloved NG, knowing what happens to Data's \\"family\\" fills me with deep satisfaction.  However, it challenges devoted trekked to see the federation as weakened, trying to pick up the pieces and even a bit scattered... all things must change I guess.  Well done for a part 1.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is my favorite of the series.  Love the whole Game of Thrones series and cannot wait for the next one
B008JFUREC|5.0|Loved the movie except nothing but the The Smurfs 2⭐🌎😍😋😆🎰<br />I don't see why it should be 3 out of 5
B000004286|5.0|Saw the movie 5 times. Love the story.  The music is haunting, tender, regal, brave,  With soundtrackts you get the whole range of the emotions of the story.  This one is exceptional.
B00001SIES|5.0|Every time I hear this music I get a great feeling.  The song writing and sound production are top notch.  The energy in their sound is amazing.
B006X96PF6|5.0|I love this woman, her music, her mind, her heart, her soul. Having most of her music and seen her in concert this is not what I would call my favorite but I was a long way from home and my music and I needed a fix and this did it.
B0074YVW1G|4.0|If you are managing people in your team, don't make the mistake of writting off the quieter team members around the table. Taking the time to undertand the world of introverts can help you extract the talents that these people can bring to your team, by creating environments and communications which best stimulate the strenghts of this part of your team.<br /><br />Should you be an introvert, don't fight your talents trying to be the extrovert you are not. Take the time to learn about the world of introverts and how many of these people have succeeded utilizing their inherint talents, take stock of your talents, and channel your energy you have effectively in achieving success.
B005LAII4E|3.0|not a particularly great movie. Lot's of star power. Think a better story would have helped a lot. You had all the pieces it just lacked in execution.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is the revolution in streaming devices. I have Roku and other streaming devices but with chromecast, it took streaming to next level. I can control from phone or computer or tablet and netflix is crystal clear. I wouldn't say it is perfect, coming to chrome browser tab sharing but for the price, it is really awesome. I definitely recommend this product. I hope more number of android apps support this cast in future.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Story telling at it's best. If you like great stories you will love this one.<br />This is a movie you can watch again and again. A must for any movie collection.
B004CGUC06|5.0|Very funny.. The movie reminds me of my family.. interesting, funny and full of love.. thanks.. Amarcord will keep u smiling
B008JFUO4U|5.0|never saw the twist coming. Cruise might be a little &#34;different&#34; in real life but the man makes a great movie almost every time.<br />Definitely a watchable. Good pace nice story well done.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I felt this was an exceptionally good movie . As it was taken from a true story ,<br />It really happened . I watched it twice and sent it to my son we are both<br />Baseball buffs and like the Athletics as we are from the Bay area ,Calif.<br /><br />Buy this movie or rent it it's worth it ....
B00AJER3SE|5.0|what can I tell you I saw this movie 26 times at the movies and it's still one of my favorites. The cleaning up and improved resolution just makes it better. Sound is great too.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|The connector often separated from the charger (staying stuck in the computer) after losing one this way, i found that a little superglue will fix the Magsafe2 to the Magsaf adapter.  Unless you need to use it both ways, this is a good way to make the change permanent.
B004SVM7BW|4.0|The reader is a good app. Sometimes a little slow to respond but overall I would say if you don't have a reader this is a good choice
B00947N6UG|5.0|This is my son's all time favorite movie. Cute plot with great message. Great satirical comedy mixed in for the grownups too.
1476727910|5.0|What an original story...I could NOT put it down! It was suspenseful, creative, and at times a little bit funny. The jacket says that it is really humorous, but I didn't find it so. There were a few ha-ha moments, but for the most part, it was quite serious. A must read for sure.
B005S9EKCW|1.0|I wanted so much to enjoy this when I saw it many many months ago, but it was truly an ordeal just to get through it.  And I have been a fan of most of the principals since early in their careers.  Plus I've enjoyed the show in more than one theatre, and have the 25th anniversary performance on Blu-ray.  Some have said that those who loved this as a musical are more apt to NOT like it and those who haven't seen it on stage are more likely to like it, and that is certainly true in my case.  The music never came alive for me, and there were moments when I was waiting for the music to reach certain notes, but it never did, because of the limitations of some of these actors who also sing, which was very disappointing.  After I watched this version on film, I pulled out my iPod and listened to the 2-disc London original with Colm Wilkinson and Patti LuPone and Michael Ball, and what a relief it was to hear these great songs sung by real singers!  Then I put on my Blu-ray of the 25th anniversary performance, which, while not 100% perfect, was head and shoulders above what I had heard while watching THIS misguided disaster.  As I wrote above, surely the most UNmusical musical I have ever seen on film.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|TOM HARDY AS &#34;BANETIS MOVIE COULD HAVE MADE SO MUCH MORE MONEY IF NOT FOR THE STUPID SHOOTING INCIDENT! STUPID AVENGERS DIDNT DESERVE TO BE THE #1 BEST SELLING MOVIE AND BREAK ALL THOSE RECORDS! IM POSITIVE THAT THIS MOVIE WOULD HAVE MADE A LOT MORE MONEY IF NOT FOR SOME JERK PRANCING AROUND LIKE JOKER! I MEAN THE BAD GUY IS BANE! WHY Was HE DRESSED AS JOKER!?!?!? LEDGER IS DEAD GET OVER IT, SURE HE WAS AWESOME BUT DONT MAKE A MOCKERY!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FLUFFY OMG OMG OMG OMG I LOVE THIS EFIN APP SOOOOOO MUCH WHOOO MINIONS BEN NU BE NU BE NU BE NU
B005LAIIKI|5.0|THI MOVIE DESERVED WAY MOR AWARDS BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE DONT WANT TO PROMOTE SLAVERY MOVIES WHERE THE MAIN CHARACTER IS BLACK!  ITS FINE BECAUSE CHISTOPHER SHULTZ WAS IN IT AS WELL AND HE IS A GREAT ACTOR AS WELL BUT JAMIE FOXX SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING I MEAN THIS WAS ONE OF HIS BEST PERFORMANCES!<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE TO OWN!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series is wonderful! Wonderful dialogue and wit. I felt like I was reading a book. Definitely a must see.
B001HN690O|5.0|COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL KUNG FU PANDA, THIS MOVIE BLOWS THAT ONE AWAY! THIS WAS A BETTER STORY AND MORE ACTION PACKED AS WELL AS COMEDY! IF THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL IT WOULD HAVE MADE WAY MORE MONEY IN MY OPINION! IT HAS BEEN UNDER_RATED!<br /><br />GREAT BUY OVERALL!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|didn't work at first but all I had to do it force close and after that it worked perfectly fine.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|THE JOKER IS FREAKING HILARIOUS AND CHRISTIAN BALE AS BATMAN! HOW MUCH BETTER COULD IT GET! WAY BETTER THAN BATMAN BEGINS AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED!<br /><br />GREAT DEAL GET IT IF YOU WANT IT!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I can't believe I didn't start watching it when it came out 3 seasons ago. So glad I ordered the DVD's to catch up so I'll be ready for season 4!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Knowing next to nothing about North Korea, this was a mind blower.  I know we all hear about the void of human rights in that country but it is almost impossible for us who come from democratic upbringings to begin to fathom what that really means.  Everyone needs to read this story.  If Shin In Geun will ever be a normal human being is doubtful but his perseverance, resilience, and tenacity evidenced in this book may get him to that point and I truly hope that he will.  A heartbreaking account of his life thus far.
B004TI5N38|3.0|If you haven't read Baldacci don't start here -- read the two Will Robie books (The Innocent & The Hit) instead. Will is a more believable, more sympathetic character than John Puller, IMO
B002DEZXOE|4.0|I was 9 during Wood Stock and would have LOVED to have been there! Amazing harmony of music and people of all ages.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|My first Baldacci. Well done, suspenseful. I did guess the &#34;bad guy&#34; before the reveal but that didn't make me enjoy it any less!
B00459EZSU|5.0|i love sgu 1 and 2.  could not believe it was not continued.  sure am pissed with you guys.  please redeem yourselves now.  thanks
B00634GHJA|1.0|I downloaded this as a Free app-- so no skin off my nose with $. but I was not able to successfully download pictures from my Motorola M to my PC. I was able to finally figure out the directions-- it was never able to &#34;find my device&#34; so had to manually update-- I would get up to getting a few pics off phone and ready to download to PC when I would get error messages and it wouldn't download my zip files... I tried a few times. found a new free program with out all the fuss.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|This book is very slow and ridiculous and a terrible ending  I will not be reading any of Gillian's other books
B000SW2F80|4.0|George A. Romero & Stephen King do a brilliant job on this one. The short stories are all good but my favorite is The crate that is more Creepy than scary. This has an all star cast throughout the entire movie this was made a long time ago based on a comic book so it's put together very well considering when it was made not bad at all. just like the series it's got an all star cast also. it's entertaining and some are scary especially if you watch it alone or with one or two people at night and live in dark secluded street that's quiet.
B000I9U8VO|5.0|I begged my Mom to let me see this movie for seven months, and it was worth it!!! It's one of the best movies I have ever seen!!!!
B00020HEG6|5.0|Love the songs 'Buck-beaks flight' and 'Double double toil and trouble'. it combine a good combination of classical, and jazzy music in a way that works well together
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Once again Neil Gaiman has written a story filled with wonder and incredible characters. Can't wait to read more of his works
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This TV show took me by surprise I had no idea how raw and hard core it was.if you love crime dramas with crazy unstoppable twist in every episode then this is for you.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I liked the three stories that went on concurrently. It kept me intrigued to the end. I am a fan of her books!
B00E8B1358|5.0|Love the action. Loved all the actors in it  the Rock and Bruce Willis were great  the affects were great also
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App opens fine..tells me to select image i do..but after clicking ok after selecting image goes back to the app portion and asks me to pick an image again so i did it again same thing..it would give it more stars if it actually let me do something. -5 stars
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Downloaded this on my new Sony Xperia Z tablet. Works very well as what I am used to using the Kindle for PC and my Smartphone. No problem downloading through Amazon App. Great program, love reading my books on my Kindles.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|But if you are hoping for a good story, you'll have to look elsewhere.  Like I said above, great special effects though!
B003F3FJQO|2.0|I's like one of those TV shows that goes in circles. If the voyage was to end there'd be no reason to tune in next week. If when find out what these tests are reviewing we say to ourselves certainly there must have been a better way to accumulate this data. But, I guess we would have a thrilling, quick-paced story.
B000XT1P3E|5.0|Love the movies.  Love the package.  Two good movies for the price of one.  How can it go wrong?  Dont answer that.  What could be better?  They could always add an additional 2 movies in there.......
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|So glad I took the time to watch 3 seasons of. Downton Abbey this summer. Can't wait to see season 4 in January.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I got this book for my 9 yr old. he was very pleased and read it pretty quickly! He said the book was better than the movie
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app works just fine if you follow the instructions written by By Betsy (the Quilter).Followed her comments and have no trouble saving pictures to my Kindle Fire HD gallery..
B00BGD07KS|5.0|This song is song by one of the greatest singers of our time, sending a positive message that captivates you, start to finish.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was amazing. LOVE the ending. Sexy but also romantic and sweet. Not for anyone under 18 though. Imho.
B007HO392S|5.0|This album is by far the best the of Carrie Underwood's career. Every song is engaging and meaningful. Strong vocals and addicting melodies.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|Pet Shop Boys are BACK! after the dreaded Elysium cd which was not PSB as we all know and love, they drew us back with this pop masterpiece.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I used to use potato mashers back in the day, then full-featured speedlights, then this.  It's about all most of you will ever need for light balancing, catchlights, fill, strobe triggering, etc.<br /><br />Skip the big guns and buy this, then learn how to use it.  Good photography happens mostly in the six inches between your ears.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|Please add me km99f and I will like you star girl is a fun game for girls<br />It's really fun
0307001369|5.0|Scarry's &#34;Best Word Book Ever&#34; was the book my children, now grown, repeatedly went back to.  It's too big for my little granddaughter at this point, so I'm happy for the &#34;Best Little Word Book Ever&#34; until she is big enough to hold the other one.  The wonderful illustrations of each word and their placement in the world on the page is very instructive ~ and most entertaining.  It provides a happy environment in which to learn words.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game and the people I play with is awesome at this game and its hard when your about to win but someone puts out a card that doesn't help you it sucks but I love this game
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Love it great item surprisingly easy to use<br />I would suggest a stylus for magic pen feature very convenient on class setting
0345803493|3.0|I knew the book was gonna have damage but Jesus, torn and bent to hell! Still readable though. Also was never given a tracking number which woulda been appreciated sense it didn't arrive till today and I paid for express shipping >.< over a week wait I could just paid for standard for that. Everything else is fine though I was replacing a copy of the book that was stolen so bet I could do I guess.
0316019984|5.0|Maybe not for children because it is delicate but if you've seen the Dragons and mosters encyclopedia pop out book you can expect the same quality of work. If you haven't you will be overwhelmed with its beauty
1433247771|1.0|I thought this book was awful.  An unbelievable story that jumped around all over the place - unreal characters and situations. It lacked coherence and meaning. I read about 4 chapters and gave up. It seemed like the author didnt have a clue where it was going and it showed - sorry but that is my honest opinion.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|It was great to see the origin of the wizard and how he influenced the world we know from the original Wizard of Oz.
B004T4KQJS|1.0|Once you remove the snide remarks about States in the bible belt, the references to anti-religion, the repeated cynical phrases, browbeating anyone who is not of the author's ilk, you could publish this \\"book\\" in a 140 character Tweet. Nothing new, nothing revealing, in short this book is Nothing!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|I watched this movie when I was a young teen and it still holds my attention 30 years later. Great movie all around.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I like reading romance as much as the next girl but its too unbelievable.  I know it's fiction but a little far from reality.  I would have preferred more story and less sex.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|Love the music, so cool to be able to play it on the Cloud before CD arrived. CD arrived intact.
B00CATSONE|4.0|If this story is half true, the man was robbed! It was absorbing reading, and one was left with a bad fast in the mouth regarding the integrity of one of our most admired technologists:  Thomas Edison.  Tesla was truly the genius behind it all.
1419703692|5.0|I stumbled upon this book one day at Barnes and Noble and thumbed through it quickly. It describes in detail all the things that I've come to love about the Dark Knight Trilogy. A must have for anyone who is a fan of the movies and loves to know everything about them
B002RSQGQK|5.0|Grace Kelly is beautiful beautiful beautiful and James Stewart is funny and gruff, but the real star of this movie is Thelma Ritter as the insurance nurse.  She has all the best lines and delivers them with spot on timing.  For a window on 1950's culture and stunning fashion, or to see Grace Kelly and James Stewart in their prime, or to see a largely-unknown Raymond Burr at the beginning of his career, this is the movie to watch.  I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and it never fails to entertain.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|Set of 5 DVD's that contain the second season of SG-1.<br /><br />Everything was in new condition, and worked.<br /><br />The show is amazing, but this review is for the DVD, not the show.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|I HAVE TO SAY...THIS ALBUM IS LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL YOU BLUES FANS!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Free app of the day so gave it a try despite seeing others say it didn't save pictures. Has good features and fairly easy to use. But all that is useless if you can't save or share your edited pictures. Also not much options in settings menu like choosing where to save pictures to. Will keep it around for now in hopes of this issue being fixed?
B006Y5H74W|4.0|When is Amazon going to work with Apple and put their App on Apple TV??? I like the show Smach. Best part, dancing and singing
B005VPRG10|5.0|This was a fun build. It took a little longer for me to build than other sets of similar brick count (which is a good thing). I'm really, really glad they chose not to use flat bricks again on the wings. On older TIE-series models, the offset flat bricks gave the diagonal lines a \\"staircase\\" appearance which was very ugly in my opinion. In this model, single-piece bricks are suspended between two points, maintaining the clean, diagonal lines. Well done, LEGO.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|Insightful drama about Washington..  Kevin S is amazing and the plot just keeps you coming back for more.  A MUST Watch !
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|I think this is a perfect example of the massive potential for CUUSOO projects. I love the BTTF series and I'm really impressed that all three films are represented in this one model. The one complaint I have is the inability to sit Marty & Doc in the car. The inside dimension is too low to have them sit without having to remove their hair. I feel this is a big enough complaint to deduct one star from what is otherwise a 5-star design.
B009NY43NY|5.0|If you read the entire series you will not be disappointed! These are great books! Each has a new story line, but she also explains the background story in most so if you don't read a previous book you still know what is going on.
B0089OBLDO|4.0|Got this so I could use my old PS2 Hori arcade sticks on PC, PS3 and 360, and so far it has allowed me to do just that. Using it on the 360 is a bit of a hassle and it gets the positions of the A and B buttons switched for some reason, but otherwise it works just fine. The only bad thing I found was that it doesn't seem to recognize my PS3 arcade stick when I try to use it on the 360 or my PC.<br /><br />Edit: Looks like you can get Home/Guide button functionality on PS2 controllers by holding Select while pressing Up on the d-pad. A handy undocumented feature.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a pretty good game to waste time. I haven't bought anything and I love it.<br />Easy to use and you can find friends fast.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|There wasn't anything I didn't like about this movie.  Matthew McConaughey was great but the two boys who played in it were superb!  The story line was a bit 'out there' but, then, it WAS a movie and all things don't need to be real in movies, do they?  This provided a nice evening reprieve from the tedious repeats on TV!  Well done.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|i liked all the songs. since i didn't read the list of songs the live version at the end was a nice surprise.
067101756X|1.0|At first in the interest of full disclosure:<br /><br />I'm not a believer in UFOs and to a lesser degree, government coverups.<br /><br />That said, i bought this book mostly on a lark and it paid off in spades.<br /><br />The authors ask us to believe that Roswell 1947 was the beachhead of an extraterrestrial invasion. From that point on it was a Forrest Gump experience.<br /><br />The author(not the collaborating writer)then leads us to believe he was intimately involved in the invention of printed circuits, lasers, night vision goggles, kevlar, and how many other things we take for granted today.<br /><br />Along the way we are led to believe he was good buddies with Eisenhower, Bobby Kennedy, J. Edgar Hoover, and CEOs of various military/industrial honchos along with the assorted CIA/KGB personalities.<br /><br />What a bunch of crap.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I have to say I really enjoyed this book. I read alot of romance novels and this one really kept me interested. It was sweet, romantic and sometimes hot. I would really recommend this book.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|It's SoA.... what else needs to be said?<br /><br />My wife and I LOVE this show / series.  It's the best TV show we have EVER watched.  Blu-Ray quality is awesome.  Nothing like hearing those Harley's in surround sound.<br /><br />Thanks to this show I am now a Harley owner myself :)
B004YOEFG8|2.0|Was nice but thë price was way to high. Expected much more for 32.00 Never again will I spend that much for a 44 minutes.
0345803485|5.0|E.L James opened up the world of Erotic Romance so that it is alright to now talk about what we have all been thinking, yes I have been reading erotic romance for quite some time, but when she released this trilogy we had a tsunami of women all over the world saying yes, yes, yes.. thank you for such a beautiful story I loved it.. couldn't put the books down, had to finish, and when I did I wanted more.. if you haven't read fifty shades your missing out.. once u get past the first fifty pages the book takes off...
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Loved this book!  Very informative and entertaining!  As a runner I loved it but non runners would enjoy it as well.  A great read!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show and somehow I got addicted to it. Once I start watching, can't stop. The good thing is that you end up learning something about the law as well. Highly recommended!!!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|My blu ray DVD does not play. It just a blank screen when I play it on my PS3.  The bonus DVD played fine. I need to return it
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|ADDICTIVE!!!  But fun!  My husband and I both challenged ourselves to getting 3 stars on all the levels...he did better than I, but neither one of us could put it down!  No glitches, just fun!
B008JEJO88|1.0|Tried them on and returned the same day.  Ordered them as a replacement for regular crocs that wore out.  Ordered same size and could almost fit two feet in one shoe.  I was not attracted to the green but thought I could live with it.  In reality these are crazy ugly.
B003Y3BBL2|5.0|I do love this book but I really dislike Amazons rules around having to at least have twenty words in here... we are not in school as this is not a word counting competition... #justsayin
B003Z49LYO|5.0|I love historical movies of this era. I'd say that if Jane Austen wrote a tragedy, it would go like this.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Once I began reading this novel, I didn't want to put it down. I was completely amazed by the storyline and the honesty this book had. In this generation, suicide is becoming more and more common each year. Like Jay Asher wrote, one thing that may seem so little actually leads to something much larger.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This is a very fun and cute story. Moves along nice and smooth and fun characters to get to know. Have recommended it to friends.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This was a major upgraded game from the first....better graphics, weapons, and characters this new games has it all.  Perfect game for any age of gamer
B004R63MWQ|3.0|It was an okay distraction for a couple of hours but Jeff Bridges felt like he was just channeling the dude in a VR setting.
B0053TMP24|5.0|If u haven't read it yet u should !!!!!!<br />It's full of crazy monsters romance and war<br />I hope u enjoy it as much as I did
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Epic conclusion to a staggering achievement in tv. Love firefly and recommend to any brown coat who needs to complete their collection or finish the series.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I downloaded this app because YouTube wasn't working on the Internet. This worked ok then I downloaded a virus checker thing and or told me to delete the app. Don't waste your time with this app.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Castle is a great series and defiantly worth the watch. Especially for fans of Nathan Fillion and / or Firefly. It's not scify but it's an enjoyable watch.<br />-chan
B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|This was a fun game until I got to level 24.  At level 24 it won't load the next level when you hit continue.  I have gotten as far as level 26 but it won't load anything after that.  It just keeps going to a blank screen.  I've tried the back button and try again but nothing works.
B0001KZNLA|1.0|This movie would not play on my DVD player or my PS3!!! It gave some message about being created in a different Region so I had to watch it from my computer..........Not happy about it at all!!
B001XUIBNO|5.0|I've seen &#34;Chinatown&#34; numerous times and was delighted to find it on Amazon, free with Prime membership. The musical score conveys the sense of the movie... the melancholy of a regular guy against big money.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I bought this for my twin brother who is a huge Elvis fan. He was beyond excitedd to receive it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I really like the way the characters are developed so you get to know them. I also like they show both upstairs and downstairs people and problems of both
B002NXSRX4|5.0|I thought this movie was awesome. From the story to the special effects and non stop action, anyone who grew up with the cartoon will love this and even if you didn't grow up with it the cast makes it enjoyable to watch.
B00BB8Q13A|3.0|OK for a mindless evening.  A bit silly and used sexual scenes to deter from lack of content.  Would not watch again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love the cast, love the writing, LOVE the clothes! This is a must-see for anyone who loves to be outwitted by clever banter and plot twists (but rarely is)!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can't really go wrong, it's solitaire.  Hard to mess this game up.  It's a good app I would get it again.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|My review:  This next book picks up not long after the first in the series, Beautiful Creatures, ends.  In my opinion, this book is darker than the first, coming on the heels of personal tragedy within the story line.  I think one of the things I loved the most was how grief was handled.  It wasn't glossed over at all, giving it total reality.<br /><br />The setting of a southern small town, along with the gothic elements, is a definite stereotype of southern living, and maybe a little over the top.  But it works perfectly within the context of the story and sets the stage for even more secrets to be revealed.<br /><br />There was much more development of the characters in this book, too, which really brought some of the characters to life.  Interestingly, one of the characters that most came to life for me was one that was actually dead.  Ethan was much more of a strong presence in this book, a lot of his story being his own instead of entwined with Lena's.<br /><br />The angst level was a lot higher in this book, something that usually tends to annoy me.  But it is something that really worked for this story.  It added a pretty dark layer to the entire story and served to underscore a lot of the issues in the book.<br /><br />Things to love about Beautiful Creatures...<br /><br />  --Answers.  A lot of questions were answered in this installment of the Beautiful Creatures series.<br />  --Questions.  As many questions that were answered, there were all kinds of new questions that leave me wanting to start the next book.<br /><br />Things I wanted more of...<br /><br />  --The mundane world.  Most of the story took place in the Caster world and not nearly as much in the non-magical world.  I missed the blend.<br /><br />My recommendation:  You definitely have to read these in order to experience the flow of the story.  I think the story was better than the last and I recommend this one just as much as the first.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Excellent acting and enjoyable dialogue. I love Benedict Cumberbatch and he and the others are all very good here. I also loved the unexpected and ubiquitous Hugh Bonneville popping up in a totally unexpected role. Very worth watching but keep a large box of heavy-duty tissues handy for the end.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|LIKED PREVIOUS FORMAT MUCH BETTER!  WAS MORE DETAILED AND  ughMUCH EASIER TO NAVIGATE. WHAT HAPPENED TO DEW POINT?  DISAPPOINTED IN NEW FORMAT!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was very touching and emotional. I have been reading a lot lately, since I am a teacher off for the summer. This was one of the best of the 10 I have read this summer.
B005LAIIPS|1.0|I enjoyed the first 3 Bourne movies, and while I feel the Supremacy stood out, they all had great action, intrigue and character development.  The Legacy has poor continuity and the attempts to relate to the characters and plots of previous Bourne movies only added to the dis-continuity.  At one point I had to double check to be sure it was the same movie.  I never did see the ending, it put me to sleep!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome movie, hope they make an Avengers 2 I look forward to it.  Full of action, lots of funny moments.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|Had this one on vinyl but was scratchy. Loved all the tunes . The Boys sound great ! Good work on the delivery and packaging<br />Amazon .:)
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|This was a well written, unusual story of a woman who, daughter of a psychology professor, spends part of her childhood as &#34;sibling&#34; to a live-in chimpanzee baby.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I was warned not to install it because it was non-native code and it could do nasty things if I tried to run it.  It has been my experience that is exactly what happens when I try to run these types of programs.
1608871827|5.0|Book provides great pictures and behind the scenes thinking to the movie.  Well worth the money spent with all the information gathered within.<br /><br />Great movie, great book.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|There is an interesting balance here between fantasy and simplicity.  For much of the story it was almost a little too simple with the remembered child's POV but then suddenly everything came together and I was weeping, but in a strangely good way as Mr. Gaiman once again displayed his knack for using fiction to get to deep truth.  The only objection I have is that it was so short - the story didn't actually need more, I just didn't want it to end but it is also much shorter than his other adult novels.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Keep watching it till the emd of season 2!! Very interesting series! Only one minus point is that she changed her mind so easily
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a addictive game for the entire family. We all play. My 6 year old and 9 year old play.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Liked this movie. Kids actors were so on point, amazing performances! Ending was just ok. Still, one of the better movies I've seen lately.  Worth the watch.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|Good album to just dance to or relax too. JT's smooth vocals and sweet lyrics, as well as beats, make for great music.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|It was okay. It moved a little slow for me. I would only rent it. I would definetly not buy it.
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|Going to see them on tour, amazing band! The album is amazingly good and shows the growth of them as a band, musically and lyrically.
B00A2V2OVK|5.0|Of Course its Great, its a classic I'd recomment it to everyone.  Sci Fi enthusiasts especially I think would love this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game could be better Werth the money and same it brain battery on tablet to quickly need some work tho.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|If you love music DVDs you will love this.  Its amazing how many great artist recorded at sound city. Great little behind the scene stories of some of the best records ever made. Dave Grohl did a great job putting this together.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am listening to this book on my iPod, downloaded from Audible. Reading some other reviewers talking about the \\"log entry\\" format (most of the story is told through the main character's log entries, recorded while stranded on Mars), I have to say this format works AMAZINGLY well as an audiobook. Also, the narrator (R.C. Bray) is phenomenal, perfectly capturing the main character's irony, sarcasm, amazement, excitation, terror, etc. And holy heck, this is a funny book. I had a 6-hour trip alone yesterday in the car by myself, and laughed constantly, occasionally pounding the steering wheel. More than one driver gave me the \\"is she crazy\\" look. Some throat-tightening moments, a couple times had to swallow and fight back tears. Not that the book is all touchy-feely. It's not - very hard sci-fi, analytical, problem-solving focus. Other reviews have mentioned typos or problems with formatting - no problems with any of that with the audiobook version!
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|This is a game that is like Tetris, but with a twist that makes you think. It is the type of game I like, because it makes you actually use your brain and solve things. It keeps getting more & more difficult with each level by adding other types of blocks that do things you don't expect. I believe games like this actually help you with developing your mind & become better at solving everyday challenges!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|The objective of this game is very unclear. After downloading itself AFTER Kindle said it was installed, it showed us a little video, then started downloading something else. We left it alone since it was taking a while and when I came back, it was downloading some other thing. Started it over. Did the same thing. I decided to remove it. Too bad. My kids love the minions ( as do I).
B005LZYL3G|5.0|Outstanding and in depth must have for every fan!! Decent documentary as an introduction to the band as well. Highly  Recommend
B005SFR7YE|3.0|The picture quality during many scenes is not good. The actual filming and editing left alot to be desired.  It paled in comparison to the Les Mis 25th anniversity DVD.  The sound recording was better than the picture quality.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This matching game is a lot of fun. Spinning the cube around to find matches is possible. You can even look through the middle to match.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|I like it, but how would I know if you will enjoy it?<br /> If you have had pleasant experiences with previous Radiohead albums this might be right up your alley.
B005NJFSZK|5.0|I bought this product for my son. It looked like the big car and not the small match box car, So I was disapointed in the product. My son seems to like it. plus the servest was good.
B0016CJNS6|5.0|This album is nice.  More of a folk-y feel to it, but still the Rolling Stones you know and love.  Do you love them?  Are you on the fence?  Get this album, make a decision for once in your life.  You still have time to catch them on tour, they will be touring till 2027.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who missed the first couple of seasons and wants to know how the cast got to where they have.  I have enjoyed most of the characters in the Abbey and look forward to next season.
0767817710|5.0|Very entertaining. i love westerns. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I am not sure how it compares to older version.
B000654YRY|5.0|Just what I ordered, This is by far the Best Live recording ever of Dire Straits I will buy more to give to friends
B00594XOZU|5.0|Just bored. Will talk to anyone! :)<br />Will be blocked if try anything I don't like.<br />Other then that prettt cool/outgoing guy.<br />M/16<br />Kik at top! See ya! :)
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Minion Rush is so fun I play it as mush as I can. IT is more fun than temple ran.
B00APVC8BI|1.0|This is supposed to be the extended cut - but the DVD is the original film. I don't have blue-ray so packet is worthless to me.
B003U4UOP4|5.0|I loved this series! Of course, most of it didn't make a lot of sense, but then I think the watcher could form his own opinion of what the series meant. I saw a lot of Christian metaphors, such as the man named Christian Shepard, the church that was being built on the island,etc. Great character development and, yes I cried at the end.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|I received an invite to this movie from Universal and rearranged my schedule to make sure I could get to the theater early enough. I arrived with about two hours to wait and there were about 40 people already ahead of me so I knew I was going to get into the movie. Let me just start by saying, it was well worth the wait if you're a fan of the original.<br /><br />Let me say right now there are spoilers in this review so don't read it if you don't want to know any of this.<br /><br />Obviously most of you are aware that Chris D'Amico / Red Mist is the Main villain in this film but, he's taken on a new identity known as The Mother F****r and his getup consists of his mom's old bondage outfit. Well his main goal is to make Kick-Ass pay for blowing his dad up. Of course, his mom is holding back his ambitions so, he had to kill her to get her out of the way; once that's done, he begins to form his evil posse known as the Toxic Mega C**ts.<br /><br />Kick-Ass approaches Hit Girl about training him and forming a team and she agrees as she has been skipping school and training everyday since her dad died. Unfortunately, Marcus (her legal guardian) finds out and reminds her that her father's letter wanted better for her so, she backs out of the deal and retires Hit Girl.<br /><br />Colonel Stars and Stripes has already begun forming the team Justice Forever; His team would become the new partners for the man that inspired them in the first place... Kick-Ass!<br /><br />Uncle Ralph took over the family when Chris' father was killed. In an attempt to dissuade Chris from forming his posse Uncle Ralph has Chris' only friend killed and this lesson is not lost on the MotherF****r as he learns to hurt Kick-Ass, he has to hurt those closest to him.<br /><br />So, the basic plot of the movie has always been revenge against Kick-Ass and this revenge starts with the death of Colonel Stars and Stripes, the Beating of Night B***h, and the Death of Kick-Ass' Father. Of course, the ultimate goal is to break the inspiration that is Kick-Ass by killing him, cutting him up, and feeding him to sharks (that's the plan anyway).<br /><br />Through most of the Movie, the MotherF***r and the Toxic Mega C**ts are wreaking havoc on the city and terrorizing the police. To say the least, the lack of Colonel Stars and Stripes has made Justice Forever a little bit weak and the lack of Hit Girl makes matters even worse.<br /><br />My only real gripe with the movie is that they made Todd an even bigger idiot than in the first movie. Everything else about the movie was great and I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />Believe me, if you were at all a fan of the first movie, you're going to love this one! It was at least as good as the first and maybe even better but, all I can say is that I really liked it a lot.
B00622D3BS|5.0|This was a really great movie. My wife and I really enjoyed it a lot. I would highly reccomend this movie to my friends.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game has an array of logic puzzles and hidden objects that keep you entertained and thinking. I enjoyed it a lot.
140191716X|5.0|I absolutely love Doreen Virtue books. I have numerous of her books in my library. They are so to the point,  easy to read and to have a message as a focus point for the day is just what our angels want is for us to focus on them and how readily they are to help us.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that would like their spiritual beings help.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|I really, really, really enjoy this entire album! I would say (almost) every song is a hit in my book.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Good special effects and loaded with silly hollywood showmanship.Fun to watch if you like shoot em up movies and bad guys getting whats comming to them.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Came free with the deluxe disk set I got at Walmart. I think that they did a great job making the movie version, going for emotional impact rather than musical perfection in terms of the singing.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|Light, easy to mount and use on my Nikon D600.  Sound quality has been great even from over 15 feet away.  Perfect for most everyday uses and keeps lens noise down to a whisper.
B00DLZ2XQK|5.0|I'm a huge Britney Spears fan!!! I love everything about her &#60;3<br />the product arrived at the specific date, this song is really catching and amazing.<br />If you love her you should have this single!!! :D<br /><br />-This is what my daughter said.
B001D84NKQ|5.0|Great Soundtrack, I just love it and arrived in time
B007D2XSW0|1.0|When I try to open a picture (from gallery or from camera) the program pauses for a few seconds and then the interface returns with nothing loaded.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Ok, I like the show.  But I hate having to write something when all I wanted was to quickly give this a star rating, like we do on Netflix.
B00AEFXEZE|4.0|It is not a move you would watch more than once, but all in all it was a good movie.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Was intrigued by the previews and this movie didn't disappoint in any way.  Was left speechless and in awe especially during the credits.  Kudos!!!!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|definately a keeper. Didn't think I would like it so much, but the story is fast pased and keeps you on your toes. Might give the kids nightmares, but they don't have to see this one.
0345529057|5.0|I've been hooked on this series for the summer, they're great! If you want to be productive in other things though, these books are dangerous. Very easy to get addicted too, and the books are so long that it won't be a quick read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent writing! Good read. Got a book hangover. Love the story line with travel, art and philosophy. Learn a lot through the book.
0399255370|5.0|This book animates and personifies your kid's set of crayons and let's them speak up and voice their complaints.  A great book. My daughter really enjoys it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a well told, historically rich story. I find it a limitless bit of a stretch that the kitchen maid could begin the mistress of the house. Other than that the characters were well written and the story is interesting.
B005544V6A|5.0|Just discovered this show and all the reviews of its success are true. Great actors, great scripts and such a pleasure to watch.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A truly great series.  It is too bad the American TV is incapable of producing anything that can even come close to this.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I don't think that this is worth five bucks, but it is pretty cool and useful. It's also very easy to use. I can't think of anything else or any other feature to add to this to make it better. I'm glad I got it.
B0094WK9EC|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my grandson so it is his kind of music, not mine.  However, I did enjoy several of the songs on this CD.
B005K15XR4|5.0|I love listening to this while driving.  Being that it has no lyrics, it nice to listen to and feel the music!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|This CD has several excellent tunes from Bruno but a few are just so-so.  Overall, a pretty darn good CD.
B00C7JFIRC|4.0|Great special effects.Still love the original version the best,nothing can beat it.Would have been nice if they incorporated the Tin Man,The Lion & The Scarecrow,but is still a good family movie.Shows how things could've gotten started before Dorothy made it to Oz.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Several currently popular songs on this CD.  Has somewhat of a &#34;blue grass&#34; sound.  Different than most you hear today.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game super addictive but so worth it. I've even been competing with friends and its even more fun. Love it
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|Held your attention, action packed, acting was lame but expected. Some good action scenes and decent story line, worth watching.
B00ATP24NW|2.0|I wasn't impressed with this cd. I like the variety of the songs, and the fact that each song isn't the same tone or tune over and over. It just wasn't my cup of tea though.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|Great movie! The plot is fast moving and has just enough emotion to keep girls interested while having enough action to keep guys watching. It's a great date movie!! As for the product, the Blu-ray was in excellent condition when received. It shipped quickly and I've watched it several times since receiving it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very addictive game modem game of cludo. Not to hard to play but gets a little harder as it goes on try it
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I love Star Trek and I love Vulcans, and the DVD was in perfect condition when I got this and I love it, and it's a great movie and this was incredibly inexpensive.
1623360277|5.0|Loved the book.  I was raised on milk, eggs, all dairy and all meats.  I have changed my diet to be more in keeping with Dr.<br />Mc D. recommendations and feel great, good energy and am losing inches/fat and weight about 2 lbs per wk.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|^ it gets better every time . Get it , play it, rock on and turn it up.<br /><br />Keep calm, and drop that bass.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is awesome. This is like the best game.But what i really want is update.i can't wait.iam really freaking out.
0061906220|5.0|My kids cant get enough of all the Pete the Cat books but this one gets read the most!!  They love it!!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|i have minecraft but i got it from 4 share is free. this is amazing. best game i ever play.its really fun.u to try it.it has every thing.so cool.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Having read the book, the movie does a poor job at character development. I feel as if I hadn't read the book then I would not have had any idea what the movie was about or who anyone was supposed to be. Skip the movie, read the book.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is way better and more detailed then the movie. If you are a fan of fantasy you will love this book. So buy it!!! I mean it is free isn't it. Why are you still reading this?!?!? You should be reading this book!!!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The story is grim subject matter, but the characters are funny, lovable and their relationship is as deep and real as anything.  I was sad to see the story end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Love This Game It`s So Fun everyone Should Play There`s Too Many Ad Though I Like That There Is So Many Option`s
B005OT2YVA|5.0|LOVED THE MOVIE.WE WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE.LOTS OF ACTION SCENES.THE TRANSFORMERS ARE AMAZING. LOVE ALL THE ROBOTS.CANT WAIT TILL NEXT MOVIE.
1579128955|5.0|If you are interested in chemistry at all, get this book... 'nuf said.<br /><br />I hope, in the spirit of Theodore Gray, I write: please remove the annoying quote of John Tierney from the Editorial Reviews and the back cover of the book. While it is intended to be praise for the work, what he says is this is the only book of its kind he has ever seen and it is the most gorgeous. Well, since it is the only one he has ever seen it is meaningless to say it is the most anything. This egregious, empty quote reflects badly on the content of the book and is anathema to the clarity of Mr Gray's prose. I hope you will agree and expunge this quote from future editions.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|...and just as filling :-) Comes through with flying colors -- action, suspense, special effects, and a touch of a love story.
B00E9O6C96|5.0|I had been looking around for a audiophile-grade portable music player, but couldn't find one in the right price range for the features I wanted.  This one appeared to fit the bill, so I ordered it.  I put a 32gb card into it and downloaded some 24bit 96khz files that I have been using for my home Squeezebox (Transporter) system.  I did some listening with my UE earbuds and couldn't believe the sound.  The first thing I noticed was the \\"dark\\" background - no hiss, no hum, just dead silence.  When the music came on, the detail was amazing along with very smooth sound - no boominess in the bass and no harshness in the treble range - just right.  I am still trying to figure out how to make an actual playlist on the player, but that's a minor thing as I can always number the selections to put the files in a certain order.  Highly recommended!
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I love invicta's and I would recommend any type and any style. The best was the best around and it looks sharp also.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am enjoying these novels by Sylvia Day....her writing style sucks the reader into the novel & doesn't let her go. If you fell in love with Christian Gray, you need to meet Gideon Cross. I think many women would adore having Eva & Cary as friends, & through them Christian. Be warned, this is one you cannot put down, as we're the 2 earlier on in the series......
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome I kinda stayed up until 1:00 this game is a little to awesome to talk about<br /><br />Spongebob
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm not a numbers person and couldn't find my calculator so I downloaded this program. The numbers are nice and large and it's easy to use. Great application!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|It certainly is a pretty movie! It's entertaining too, not a bad story and has some good twists...if you don't guess too hard. There are some pretty major holes in the plot, but hey! It's fun.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good, the effects are stunning. Things are pretty well paced and interesting. Tom Cruise isn't just &#34;Tom Cruise&#34; in this movie either (which is good!)<br /><br />I don't regret renting it at all.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is one of the stronger books in the series. I can't wait for the next one to hit the bookshelves.
B001CB8NQE|4.0|this was a good show I started looking at season 1 till it's end .at times some of the plot drags or repeats it's self but when you want look at a show w/o comercials through the sean this is a good choice for the Sci Fi lover
B008Y78M60|4.0|This movie is more about the assassination of Lincoln than the latest Lincoln movie.  Granted it does focus on the woman involved, but it still focused on the plot.  After watching this movie, I watched Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln and it was even better.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|I am a 12 stepper and herd about this movie in the rooms of recovery . I would not say this is a how to get sober movie , but those of us who have been on &#34;Top&#34; in our chosen profession only to have it come tumbling down this is for you .<br />I liked the actors from other movies so this also is a plus if you are into recovery and new this may not be for you as there is lots of drinking drug use throughout the movie . If you have sober time under your belt and need a reminder of the lies, deceit we were all about in active use until the crash.  In the end the mind of a good person takes back over and realizes enough is enough.<br /><br />For the lay person not fighting any addictions I am not sure you will understand a movie and the demons that are with this disease and follow us threw every waking moment and often into our dreams forcing use to wake up satisfy those demons to return to sleep .<br />I am glad I bought this movie (prime customer)  and have looked at it many times since ,every time I seel a item things start going great ,and the drinking thought pops in .I simply put this on within 20minutes I know I am glad to be sober today ,this movie reminds me and will you where you do not want to be if you take that drink,or drug again.<br />I am not a writer but flute master today working a 12 step program and living one day at a time, I to was a professional in the medical field .today sober I rent a 10x10 room 8x10 work shop from the 3 story house I once owned . I can say I happier now there is no more of the confusion lies that went with the active addiction . This movie simply put with great acting reminds us we are but one drink from all this again<br />Bob<br />Crazy Bear Flutes
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|The Shield is not for the faint at heart. Use of a handheld camera gives the viewer an over-the-shoulder sense of being there.<br />It's a gritty, at times violent story of LA police and a strike force led by a morally bankrupt detective. There are, however, lighter moments.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|this app is great for pictures but there should be an amazon app that can hold other apps in one app. and it be called amazon app cloud. or something like that.just saying.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Good clean exciting fun and action for the whole family.<br />Nice twists that keep you guessing.<br />Does not get old.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show!!!! I started watching it one saturday when my husband was out of town, and I fell in love with this show. It is like Walking Dead with aliens!!! Love this show! My husband started watching it too, though I have finished all the seasons in prime, he is watching the season 1 even though he has watched season 2 and 3 as he loved it!!!
B008Y73940|4.0|This is a nice well thought out movie.<br />Loved the twist at the end of the movie.<br />McConaughey easily carries the movie.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I used to watch Good Wife occasionally, but thanks to Amazon I love it. It is very interesting and it focuses on personal and professional life which makes it a very good show!
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|Went to the concert to support this album. Great show! They sound just as good live as they do on the album. Some of the songs are more catchy than others.... but overall I can listen to this again and again!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The characters are more developed and intertwined. Relationships between the help get more complicated and interesting. And there are lots of shocking twists to leave you begging for season 4!!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Our family loves this movie. We had to order this disk set because the last one died a un happy but very used death.<br /><br />This set comes with a blue ray disk, a dvd disk and a free copy of the movie provided by Amazons Instant Play video service shortly after purchase.<br /><br />I highly recommend for the price you get this because it provides many wonderful ways to watch the movie and you are not limited to one way failing after its attacked by your children.
0064471837|5.0|The story weaves through a rich world that captured my attention. Between Harry Potter, Golden Compass, and Narnia this series held it's own as another unique world. This was my first exposure to necromancy and this kind of magic. It was thrilling and scary and amazing! It was the perfect book to read as I waited for other series to continue and soon became one of the most eagerly anticipated. I enjoyed every page and wish I could read it again for the first time.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite books and the news that a new book is coming out means that it is time for a reread!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app i have been able to find everything I need to plan my wedding through the ideas here alone!!
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|I love Jo Nesbo.  It's good to read the story about Australia which was referred to in several other books.  I really enjoyed it.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Wow I had given up hope for the rap genre<br />thought it was done and left up to kanye<br />Along comes Mack and gave rap some hope<br />Thrift shop and the driven is so dope.<br />Only thing that puts off is the stanky fur coat<br />some critters anally electrocuted so yo<br />that aint dope and its a corpse<br />and its stank and nasty.<br />Just like us it loved it's mammie.<br /><br />U better than all that Mack!<br />Give u five stars anyway!<br /><br />Having said all that, I dont think I can name anyone more deserving of making it big after putting in 10,000 hours, than Macklemore. After hearing his story within, The Heist - its truly a work of art and Im so happy I didnt just brush this one off as 'new' music that doesnt have much substance like so many others. Like Adele, P!NK, the driven is there, and same with The Heist. I love this CD so much im turning all my old timer friends on to it and they like it too!<br />Five Stars.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the previous books and I enjoyed this one more then the last.  I enjoyed the way the bitter sweet stories wove together.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Without giving away any plot line, this book opened up a lot of questions that I didn't know how to answer. Definitely makes you think a lot.
B001N1DPDE|1.0|Title kind of sums up my feelings about this knife...I just don't get it.<br /><br />I have had this knife for some time, but have been hesitant on writing a review,<br />as I figured I would probably get a lot of nasty comments/hate mail.<br /><br />Everyone seems to absolutely adore this thing.  I mean...if you gave an award for<br />the most commonly chosen survival knife....you would have to give it to the BK2.<br /><br />I'll get right into my issues with it.<br /><br />Its too short and fat.<br /><br />It doesn't carve well (too fat)  It doesn't slice well (too fat)  and for those that<br />like to baton....I honestly don't think its a great choice for that either (too short).<br /><br />Everyone seems to rave about what a \\"beast\\" this thing is and how much punishment it can take.<br />Well thats great....but how much punishment does a knife have to take?  I mean really...when<br />you are talking about wilderness survival, I assume most people are speaking of using it to<br />baton logs, when they refer to all this punishment.  I agree....you are probably never going<br />to break your knife while batoning.  You might chip or roll your edge like any other knife,<br />but you are not going to snap the spine or break off the tip or hurt the tang.  Its too short<br />and fat for that.  However....this knife isn't that long...you don't have enough length to tackle<br />a log that is going to require the knife to be as thick as it is.  So I just don't get it.<br /><br />Because of its immense thickness from tip to tang....it is as heavy as a normal sized Bowie knife.<br />If you are all about batoning, why not just go with a normal size bowie knife?  You would be able<br />to baton through larger logs if you wanted to, maybe even use it as a draw knife and possibly use<br />it as a machete to clear brush.  No...with this, you get all the weight and awkwardness of a Bowie<br />without any of the real benefits.  I just don't get it.<br /><br />In my humble (or perhaps not so humble) opinion, this is a poster child for tools that have been<br />designed to be too all encompassing.<br /><br />Can you carve with it?  Yes<br />Can you use it for fish and game?  Possible<br />Will it slice?  Yes<br />Can it baton?  Yes<br />Does it do any of these things well?  Nooooooo<br /><br />I can almost see it functional as a one tool option scenario, but who actually does that.  Most of us<br />that like to go out on minimalist trips aren't going to want to take something this heavy.  If we do, we'll probably take a hatchet, machete, or large bowie knife.<br /><br />Rule of thumb when it comes to tools....if it can do everything....it probably doesn't do anything well.<br />I'd much rather prefer a thinner, smaller knife that is going to perform small tasks very well, or take<br />a large knife/Bowie that is going to handle a WIDE range of larger jobs very well.<br /><br />I don't care if its bomb proof, the fact of the matter is....this knife was made thick enough to handle<br />jobs that it physically can't even do, due to length.  You would get far more functionality out of a thinner<br />more light weight knife, and you would get more versatility out of a longer knife, or hatchet.<br /><br />I'm not a becker hater either....the bk16 is one of my favorite \\"go to\\" knives and a much more reasonable<br />option than this thing.<br /><br />This thing sits in my equipment limbo drawer.  A drawer full of tools I can't seem to find a decent use<br />for.  Or cannot justify putting it into my kit due to weight, that type of thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I just don't get it.ps not so humble) opinion, this is a poster child for tools that have been<br />designed to be too all encompassing.<br /><br />Can you carve with it?

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Awesome read a classic I will read again Treasure Island is a must have for anyone who enjoys a great adventure story
B007D2XSW0|3.0|I can not save my edits. I am stuck taking screen shots!<br /><br />Other than that it's a great app!<br /><br />Fix the issue and it might be my favorite!
1594202842|3.0|I clearly ordered a new book, but when I received it, it didn't look like a new one.<br />Rather, it was like a used one.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|Very well acted all around, but Paul Giamatti is brilliant in the starring role.  It is disappointing that the story is not entirely factual (for example, Adams' son Charles went with his father to Paris; the series depicts his being left behind), but overall very well done.
0440237688|1.0|I read the book and it did not meet my expectations its called sci fi yet its about some kid named Jonas in a stupid utopia. I do not recommend The book
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Will not save pics to the gallery. Very frustrating.  What's the point if you can't save the pic. You've got to fix it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I don't like adds running in my system, when I bought the kindle with NO ADDS. I will be deleting this game soon.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|God, am i the only person who is sick of samual jackson's bloated image of himself as a poor, downtrodden progeny of holy and oh, so talented Africans, who were, are, and will always be held down by the evil WHITE MAN? Should have had a scene where a typically gorgeous trophy Caucasian hottie jumps up and kisses Obama;s ass while they were at it. instead we get to see a black male once again mow down hundreds of stupid white men and finally the record is straight because what's his name the director tells it like it is. Jesus, when if ever are you black lovers and white haters going to write a different movie? You boys done squeezed all the white guilt and greymeat ass kissing out of this here evil white boy. Yessah. thank god finally the perfection of the black race and its superiority to all others has risen to the fore. Done taught Whitey Almighty a lesson!
B00E3RFKMY|5.0|Too bad I casn't give David's new cd a 10 star review! Buy this cd! You will not be disappointed!
B004T0E2S8|5.0|I have bee looking for a good guitar app and this one is perfect!!!!! one of the best  apps i ever had!!!!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I like this game. The only downfall is it takes a minimum of half an hour to grow a crop. I don't have time for that. un installing
B0040I09RM|4.0|I expected it to be rough and raunchy but for the most part it's not. It's a thoughtful look at NoCal motorcycle club's members' lives. Like the Sopranos, while many of the characters are flawed but likeable a few are truly evil and completely self-serving. The character development is crafted extraordinarily well especially with Gemma and Clay.<br /><br />It's a complex story that is fairly predictable at the highest level but it's the way the details unfold in each story that makes it riveting.<br /><br />BTW: The show's quality is equally good through the first four seasons.
B0081336FO|5.0|I thought the Holmes character was brought into the 20 century well and using the actor from the movies Lord of the Rings was a nice touch.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Other than the previews of the sequel currently on TV, we had no expectations.<br />We enjoyed this movie.<br />It's entertaining.
B000I8HIV8|5.0|Despite the fact that this film was made many years ago, before all the high tech creations came in,<br />it is still wonderful.  Action, suspense, mystery...I highly recommend it.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD filmed at Slane Castle in Ireland. My local PBS station featured the entire concert a few years ago. As a result, my family and I have been fans of Celtic Woman ever since. The music is absolutely enchanting.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I was beyond into the firs book. This book was good, but I found myself not liking Gideon and I love Gideon. I have a feeling I know what is happening and I shouldn't be okay with it, but I am.
B007JQLNXG|4.0|An amazing collection of current songs. Would have enjoyed this CD more if he gone back to his early material. How wonderful it would have been to hear i have the touch, shock the monkey, snapshot, the rhythm of heat performed with an orchestra. I can't get enough of Peter Gabriel but as innovative as his is, I love this CD more if he had thought outside the box for this collection.
B001OGRNH2|5.0|Excellent album, and was easy to purchase digitally and download into iTunes.  Excellent if you can't stand waiting for the CD to arrive in the mail!
B008RXYOKY|4.0|I wish Apple wasn't pushing thunderbolt so hard, but if you want a new mac and want to keep using firewire devices, this little fella gets the job done!
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I like hidden object games but this one frustrates me as I am not a mind reader.  Some of the levels are no brainers but some it is hard to figure out what you are supposed to do.  Takes the fun out of it for me.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|will not allow me to choose a photograph of my gallery... or even take a new picture... it reverts back to the opening screen there's no option but to choose a picture it just don't work... I guess for free time he deleted already
B009IF82SK|5.0|This is my favorite comedy on TV. I love everything about it. These guys are hilarious and very like able.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Tried this on a GN2. I'm a knowledgeable user. The modded pic doesn't save.  I looked for it with root Explorer and  Es Explorer. No file. I also tried changing the location saved to several other locations.  No go.<br />Verdict: useless as is.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed catching up on all three seasons of the Abbey.  Amazon video was always very high quality - picture and audio were flawless!  Highly recommend ed!!
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A book about friendships that were not supposed to be. Good book about men in a tough job in a tough town
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|My son and husband just love this game. They love growing their sharks and going on the missions, battling the giant crab and demolishing submarines. They were so stoked to reach the megladon level. It's like their little bonding time when the weekends come.
0812550706|4.0|Really creative, captures the imagination with intrigue and great ending!  Loved the development and contrast of each character's strengths and weaknesses.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Graphics are great and my son just loves to play this game. He thinks the minions are super funny and I find him just laughing and laughing at them. This one is fun for all.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Yet another wonderful entry by Harris.<br />A truly happy ending to the Stackhouse saga, though through short stories and  the upcoming 'loose ends' book, we don't have to let go just yet. Thanks for letting us let go of Sookie slowly an  positively.
B000GFLE1S|4.0|What an incredible story!!! The acting was unbelievable! I laughed, cried and laughed again.. I decided to see before the broadway play and I'm glad I did this first. This story was so much bigger than a shoe line to,accommodate drag queens, it was about learning to see and work outside the boxes we put ourselves in. It was about finding the courage to be who you are authentically and all the blessings that are behind closed doors.. Who would have ever thought one could find purpose in a unexpected death, unwanted inheritance and a back alley fight???
B0000CFW87|3.0|You would be better to down load the song, but the CD was &#34;free&#34; to finish out my order for free shipping.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I loved the first season and really looked forward to Season 2.  Now I can't wait to get Season 3.  The creator Julian Fellowes has written a wonderful and compelling story which takes place, for the most part, in a beautiful castle in England in the early 1900s.  The actors do a superb performance of portraying the many characters.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who enjoys a gripping story which will keep you wanting more...excellent entertainment.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I have no idea where Tyrion is, haven't heard anything from Danni either, except for &#34;gossip&#34;, the same as Jon Snow, and Sam is so boring. He is so afraid of absolutely everything. There is one chapter dedicated entirely to the small council chat. It was boring as hell. Although I have to say I am enjoying Brienne adventures. I know this guy, Martin said there was not a &#34;main character&#34;, but in the first book I created a special bond with the Starks, and now all I read is about Cersei, Cersei, Cersei, I don't like her and I don't want to get to know her. Jaime on the other hand has been a very nice surprise. I'm glad the very sight of Cersei makes him sick.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app it's easy,entertaining, and challenging everything a game should be I highly recommend you getting this game!! And it's free!!!
B00B9LNK5G|4.0|Perhaps it's his velvet voice - or maybe his simple lyrics - quite possibly it's the electrifying, lush synths scattered throughout - whatever it is, this album is quite perfect.<br /><br />Actually, it's one of the best albums of 2013. Really.<br /><br />While all the songs are quite amazing, three stand out to me: \\"GMF,\\" \\"You Don't Have To,\\" and \\"Glacier.\\"<br /><br />I've only been a listener to John Grant for a few days, believe it or not, so I can't comment much about his history or the stories behind the songs. But I look forward to more great albums from one of my new favorite singers.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is an extremely interesting look into the life and mind of a modern day warrior and hero. Absorbing reading.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this!!  I was so sad when it ended. I am eagerly anticipating Season 4 and what new changes the Granthams have in store!!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|How do you change your pic on uno?? Cuz I don't like the avatars the people already have..so how do you change your picture???
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The drama continues with the Crawley family and the servants.  There is no shortage of scheming and meddling, even in the midst of war.  Young men face untold horrors.  War time often makes unjust demands and some see change as an opportunity for growth.
1616550414|5.0|This is a very unique masterpiece of Nintendo company I really liked it  and I had never felt such a good feling turning the pages of a book, It´s epic and shows us more about one of the most incredible series of all time, any zelda fan has to have it in his collection.Every page is in high quality what demostres  the carefull work on it. So there´s nothing that could be downgrad in this book it´s just perfect and I recommend it. Thank you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|this weapho es is great. all the coolness of weaphones but the wwII twist. it is really cool how all of the controls on the weapons work. I would recommend this to any firearms enthusist.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great game and so addicting. And it's so funny when the midget scientist run for their midget lives. I recommend this game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I never thought that I would actually like this game but it turned out that I cant stop playing this game. There are a few downsides to it, but it is a good game. Plus it's free. :)
0345803485|4.0|it is a well written book, something different to read for a change, can easily pick it up again when you stop reading
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This book is exactly what I was looking for, a rich character driven low fantasy novel well written by a masterful novelist. My only complaint is having to wait for the further books in the series.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|The subject matter is fascinating, and the author's imagination impresses, but it's not an easy book to read. I put it down several times, to read other books, and finished with a sigh of relief.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|Its a cool time waster but after like 5 minutes you get bored because you really can't do much with it. When you save it, it tends to save in your pictures as a more digitalized form then it has to load into a more crisp form. I have a Galaxy S3 with all the updates so I don't know if its the phone or just the way the app saves it. It would be to use to make abstract background but that is about it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Drew from Amazon  because, for me, the program would not even load! And so it immediately depleted from my Kindle fire
B0073LWEXK|4.0|It was a really cool puzzle game to keep you entertained for about 2 or 3 hours but that is really it. After you solve the puzzles you really can't replay because there is only one way to solve them. The game also crashes and closes out often on the ASUS Transformer and Galaxy S3.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I picked this book after a friend told me it was her favorite book.  I find it very challenging to read books about Nazi Germany but this is a kids book, right?  It's unbelievably well written, with beautiful terse sentences that create an elaborate world. Sad, charming, full of life and death this book is wonderful.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|this app is horrible, its to fast in explaining the so called &quot;cheats&quot;, and there are only a select couple levels they explaine. they just need to make the real candu crush app for kindle fire. its ridiculous how long they have gone and its still not on here...
0786838655|5.0|It has been a while since I have read a fun teen book.  I would say Harry Potter was probably the last.  This book is in the same league.  The story is so well developed and written that you will think you are there.  This is the story of Percy Jackson, who is the son of Poseidon.  Someone has stolen the Zeus' lightning bolt and Percy is sent on a hero's quest to find it.  He takes his two best friends and the adventure is worth every page.  I can't wait to read book two!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved the format of the book. Interviews with survivors all over the world. How each person dealt with the disaster. How each geographical area dealt with the disaster. Very unique and very well written. I would definitely recommend and I will now see the movie.
B00005LIN0|3.0|I have loved the Gershwins' music since I was a kid. And I have loved Porgy and Bess since I first heard it. Based on some of the reviews read here I gave it a try. I have to say that each of the voices was great, lots of strength and depth. The sets and costuming were very good and made me feel like I really knew what it was like living then for those people.<br /><br />The things that bothered me about the production were: the male voices all sounded the same, amazing to say. The music was presented in operatic style, which meant that the voices were projected very strongly as if in presentation to a theater crowd. And that made me feel like I was being assaulted by the sounds. There was very little differentiation in the tone of any of the songs. Because of this, it was virtually impossible to hear any of the words to the songs. It's good that I knew the words already. For someone not familiar with Porgy and Bess, the viewer would have to click on the Libretto feature to get the words captioned below as the songs were sung.<br /><br />Then there is the pace of the production. It dragged on FOREVER. Remember that I love this work. I found myself wondering how much longer it was going to go on before it ended, even though I knew what the ending would be. I felt all 3 hours of it. The first act was the most difficult. Everything was paced the same, and too slow.<br /><br />While all the components of this production were good from the individual actors to the costuming and sets, the direction was grossly lacking and hurt this production. I will never watch it again.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|I dont know what I was exspecting but I dont think this was it. The game had nice graphics for a ds game, but it feels like something is missing. I dont know maybe the story needed more build up for me, or more of a backstory, but something was missing for me. Im not saying this game wasnt good because I like it pleanty, but I dont like it enough to play it day in and day out without rest or thought, it just missed the mark for me.
B00C90T4QK|2.0|Let me qualify my review by saying I have been a fan of Michael Buble's since shortly after his debut album was issued.  I have seen him in concert from the small Wiltern show captured on DVD to the big arena shows. I am the definition of a true fan.<br /><br />So it hurts me to write my criticism of this CD, so much so that I waited over 3 months to keep listening to the CD in the hope that I would come around on it.  The more I listen to it, I have come to realize that it is the absence of Michael's original producer and major promoter David Foster that is the root cause of why this is such a disappointing effort.  As others have pointed out in their criticisms, the music accompanying Michael's voice sounds somewhat muddled and mundane.  The music Michael has made with David Foster on the other hand is the perfect blend of voice and clarity on the strings, horns, etc.  For an artist like Michael who thrives on the classics, it is critical that the voice and music blend seamlessly like it does on the songs David produced.  While Bob Rock received Michael's praise for his production of this CD and the song selections, in my view, he deserves much of the blame for why it seems so lifeless.  Bob Rock made his name working with rock acts like Aerosmith and Motley Crue, so maybe Michael is seeking to distance himself from the silky sounds of David Foster to find a harder edge.  In my opinion, it does not work.  If Michael was going to go into a new direction, I was hopeful it would be more in the vain of \\"Whatever It Takes\\" the excellent smooth jazz final track from \\"Crazy Love.\\"  But there is nothing even remotely close to that song or sound on \\"To Be Loved.\\"<br /><br />I will not go through a song-by-song criticism because the album has been extensively detailed elsewhere.  I agree with most that the single \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" is uninspiring and sounds too much like his other \\"new\\" songs.  \\"Close Your Eyes\\" the dull 2nd single appears to have struck out on the radio, with good reason.  However,I was surprised how much I like the Reese Witherspoon duet \\"Something Stupid\\" but their voices blend really well.  Michael has one of those voices who make anyone singing with him sound smoother, so the duet works well.  And the ending song \\"Young at Heart\\" captures the old Michael and offers hope that he will still include his take on the classics on future efforts.  None of any of the other songs on the CD are memorable.<br /><br />While \\"To Be Loved\\" predictably jumped to #1 with all of his faithful fans like me running out to buy it as soon as it became available, it faded quickly and looks like it will fall well flat of the double-platinum selling Crazy Love (the huge selling Christmas CD is unique and cannot be compared for sales).  This one has just reached Gold and I am skeptical if it will make Platinum with no other potential hits looming.  Sales are not the \\"be all, end all\\" but I hope this setback in momentum will send Michael scrambling back to David Foster for his next CD.  Like The Beatles with George Martin, Michael Buble belongs with David Foster!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pretty Little Liars and being able to go and re-watch episodes you may have missed or to try to pick up more clues..Awesome to have on standby in case you wanna go back  to check somethibg or &#34;someone.&#34;
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Useless. What is the point. I also see reviews from November stating that they can  not save images. So when is the update coming.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Ok,  this Genie will have you and your family and friends going nuts! I can't even begin to tell you how freaked out you will get as you can very rarely stump him. He guesses everyone from actors, musicians, sports figures, tv shows, commercial products (ie; pilsbury dough boy, the keebler guys,even the michelan (sp?) tire guy!) Also, holiday characters, cartoon characters, disney characters...i can go on and on. You HAVE to try this! Seriously.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I purchased this disc for my granddaughter for her birthday and she loved it.<br />She watched it 4 times so far.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|Can't remember the last time wife and I got excited about a movie.  Most movies nowadays SUCK but this one was UNBELIEVABLE!  Amazing production design, cinematography and story.  This is now my favorite SCI-FI film.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|I purchased this because it is one of my favorites. There's not much more to say. Akroyd and Murray classic.
B0051T46XM|5.0|This is hands down one of the best found footage movies ever. Totally blew me away. I have only ever seen it subtitled, so i was excited to see it dubbed. The voices were...weird....after being used to seeing it so many times subtitled.
B00BW0QC8G|4.0|Case Logic BEBP-115 Backpack<br /><br />Pros:<br />High quality Nylon/Polyester<br />Lots of well placed pockets:<br />  -Small *phone* pocket on top has nice felt interior<br />  -Smugglers pocket *in bottom of back support* is a nice touch (used for airline tickets)<br />  -Zippers on sides are great for things besides bottles but also keep bottles from moving<br />  -- Mesh within side pockets help adjust to different sized bottles<br />  Vanishing pocket in front is ideal for wallet, keys, etc<br />Handle on top and bottom (for storing in overhead compartment) seems very well made<br />Laptop and tablet pockets are well padded (NO problems with bottom padding)<br />Mesh pockets within other pockets are good for storing small things safely<br />Great for all types of electronics<br />Overall design is pleasing NOTE: blue accents on front of bag are little rubber strands<br />Back/lumbar padding is very generous<br />No problems with heating on back<br />Arm straps go all the way across the top and behind neck for added support<br />Chest strap is great addition<br />Main compartment could fit at least 3 large textbooks or several books, notebooks, folders<br />Small front pocket has a number of pockets for pens/pencils, notecards, etc. Even has pocket for individual pen (great for fountain pen or high end pen)<br />Velcro helps keep adjustment straps from dangling in front of you<br /><br />Cons:<br />EDIT*** The shoulder straps (as some others have stated) are TOO WIDE. I'm a college male with fairly wide shoulders and while the bag has never slipped off my shoulders, the width gives it the feeling of outward movement. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR FEMALES WHO DO NOT HAVE BROAD SHOULDERS<br />Zippers could be better. Not bad, but not as good as Swissgear Synergy (best zippers I've ever felt)<br />  - Only laptop pocket zipper is large, others are small<br />Over filled pockets will cut in to space of others. Clarify: If main pocket is bulging outward it will cut in to thespace of the smaller pocket in front of it and make it hard to put pens or other peripheral in.<br />Not Great for travel:<br />  Bag does not have much outward \\"give\\" and therefore not much space for clothing or other things<br />  ^^^see above about over filling pockets<br />Lots of pockets could have you searching for item for a while.<br />***Small \\"nitpicks\\"<br />- The individual pen/pencil holder does not have a cover over it so if bag is upside down it could slide out<br />- The vanishing pocket closes when zipped up so you have to make sure that you do in fact zip it all the way up (easier to zip all the way down) I believe they did this so nothing falls out if not zipped all the way up.<br /><br />Additional information:<br />The bag is rather light, but since Case Logic's other bags are lighter and have the same pockets I'm going to refrain from calling it a Pro<br /><br />Thoughts: It's odd that with features like a chest strap and lower front handle that this bag is not great for travel. It just doesn't have the interior size if you plan on taking a trip for few days and use it as a carry on. This bag is certainly more vertical than horizontal and it cuts down on the number of things you can fit in to it. That being said, it is ideal for school/college. With a great number of pockets for electronics, books, and pens/pencils I would definitely recommend it to students.<br /><br />Overall 3.5/5 I will give it a 4 because I do not think a bag with such high quality materials should be rated at a 3 star<br /><br />Advice: Buy if you are a student not if you plan to travel a lot. DO NOT PURCHASE IF FEMALE OR MALE WITH SMALL SHOULDERS.<br /><br />Other bags to look in to:<br />SwissGear Synergy: Lots of pockets, loved by (Thousands) of users, brilliant zippers, pen pocket has cover -.-, great padding, slightly more space, laptop. Old bag so no tablet holder or lumbar compartment, slightly dated (though fine) appearance.  You can't go wrong with this bag (If Ineeded another I would purchase this)<br />Case Logic RBP 115: Very similar to BEBP-115 but more space in front pocket (open instead of vanishing pocket, lighter, smaller footprint). Design could be unappealing for some. Probably has same size and zipper shortcomings as BEBP-115<br />Samsonite Tectonic: Can't say much about this bag because I haven't gotten much hands-on time with it, but people seem to enjoy it and it looks very nice. Samsonite, like Swiss gear and Case Logic is a top class company.<br /><br />Hope this helped! Will update if there is anything to add or change. If this review helped, please answer \\"yes\\" to if this review was helpful. Also, feel free to comment if you have any questions
B006LSZECO|1.0|I bought this book because of the high ratings and amount of people that have read it. I was so disappointed! This ranks as the number one worst book I have ever read!
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Jared Diamond has some wonderful ideas about how and why some societies have risen to success whereas others have failed. He views the geography of the land as well as the availability of specific plants and animals as crucial to the ultimate success of one society or another. He has well-thought out, interesting ideas that one can think about for a long time. This is a book worth buying just to think about the issues.<br /><br />The major weakness of the book is that it is too long and the second half becomes repetitive. One ends up skimming it at the end.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I wasn't too sure about the show at first, having never watched anything on Hannibal Lecter, but this was awesome! The biggest attraction I had was that Mads Mikkelsen was one of the main actors, but after getting past the graphic depictions of murder and the shivers from his very convincing lack of emotion as a psychopath, I love it. Can't stop watching it!
1932907009|5.0|I am just finishing this amazing book. I am really sorry I didn't read this BEFORE I wrote my last screenplay. Although I have had some good fortune in the past selling stories, I can see clearly now that my screenplays will improve a hundred fold. Why? Because Mr Snyder makes a simple and easily understood outline and detailed instructions on the essentials for SELLING a screenplay.<br />I have read Robert Mckee's book (Story)and taken his amazing seminar 3 times over the years. And I recommend every serious writer to try attend if only for the wonderful theatrical enjoyment.<br />Blake Snyder, however, is in a different orbit and explains in clear, precise, terminology how to get the right ingredients blended into an award winning recipe of success.<br />I am currently re-writing now with  a new confidence and understanding of what is needed to sell my script.<br />I recommend this book to anyone tat claims to be serious about screen writing.<br />Good luck<br />L McLaughlin
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun playing game. At first you will be a little confused with what you have to do but once you get the hang if it, it gets challenging and you start getting addictive to feeling clever figuring out all the clues. Keep trying and use common sense
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is the most fun I have had on a tablet in a long time.  I love the different types of Hilarious Minions and there fun adventures.  My children love it.
0062265083|2.0|To put it bluntly, this isn't a story you haven't already read before, and I'm quite certain you could find a better version of it written by someone else.<br /><br />What this is, regrettably, is the over-done tale about a young boy who lacks knowledge about a magical world and his encounter with a young (or perhaps, not so young) girl who knows everything about it.<br /><br />You know the trope: a well-meaning, kindly boy (not special or extraordinary or even talented in any way, but ordinary, average, and maybe even a bit bookish and/or shy) is suddenly roped into events much bigger and grander than he could ever hope to understand, events which all are completely understood by a plucky girl who always knows exactly what's happening and what should be done about it, who seems wiser beyond her years and incredibly mature for her age. The boy is a fumbling lad and doesn't do what he's told and it's up to the girl (or others) to set things right again, usually at a great cost to themselves.<br /><br />To me, only two parts in the book elicited any sort of emotional reaction from me, and both times the feeling was a mixture of revulsion and horror. Aside from that, the book as a whole was a quick, if unimpressive and non-stimulating, read.<br /><br />I strongly encourage readers to lower their expectations, or consider picking up a different novel by Gaiman because this is a far cry from his best work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a remarkable resource. The only downside what that I couldn't access the NIV very easily away from wifi. But the ESV and The Message were right at my fingertips.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series!!! It is well written and the actors are wonderful. The storyline is both intriguing and delightful. You feel like you are part of the family. No cussing, no violence, no sex. How refreshing!!!!

B002ZG996I|5.0|i bought this movie and absolutely love it, I watch it over and over again, i got it on time, that was a plus
B004XWLN20|5.0|The packaging just makes the discs fit tightly into their box so simply be careful taking the discs out and you're good to go! The product itself is excellent and there are no flaws to any of the discs.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Very entertaining movie although I thought there was too much time spent on working out the differences between the super heroes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love Rue and Katniss and Peers and Gale and Me.Eddie even though she's kinda hard on everyone's manner she's still good
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Wife and I loved it.  Cute movie.  Would recommend and now plan on seeing the sequel upon its release to DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played! It us a different take on Subway surfers but much better with many different obstacles!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I had to stop the video several times to just cry and catch my breath.  Gripping, in a wonderful way.  Naomi Watts is simply outstanding.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The coolest game ever, its like you are really the hair stylist, make up artist everything, waiting for the up date
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Weird Movie. Why does Amazon REQUIRE us to type in comments. Shouldn't a star rating be enough. There are some comments for you!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very addicting and hard to put down. I was hooked the moment I saw a friend with the game, and I instantly wanted it on my Kindle. Five stars all around!
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson's creativity and variety amazes me. My wife and I both read this short story and it has been a favourite for a while now. It's short but very packed and an excellent read, I've recommended it to quite a number of folks now. The potential for this character is great and I hope we see more of this world.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Two Thumbs up! This app is great! So much fun. I would pay 0<br />$0.99 for this game  but it's free.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This app is slow and very unresponsive. I tried to load images from my gallery and... it won't work! Tried to capture a image from within the app and... NADA!<br />-Galaxy Note 2
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I REEEEEEEEEALY love this game because you can connect with Facebook or just use one of their awesome avatars! And, if you save up enough silver coins you can buy some upgraded cards that look awesome. ( I have the cupcake ones ;)  ) In the picture above I noticed you could buy backgrounds so I am going to check that out. I totally recommend this game to children of all ages! I absolutely love it!<br /><br />P.S.-BTW this is my mom's kindle but I am usually the one always playing on it and I am 10 years old. So if I like this game,I bet other kids will too :D
B00821OX98|3.0|The background story and special effects are great. The acting is good. But, too much sappy stuff. After losing 90+ percent of the population and while being hunted down by superior forces, the small band of survivors play soccer and set up  school for the kids.<br /><br />Keep the Walking Dead aspects and get rid of the Lost in Space stuff.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|Okay so I picked this one up simply because it was the manga colors they personably look better to me as a des play piece over all great figure for any DBZ fan
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I absolutely love this game! The object of the game is to make the ball that is on the container. You have to protect the ball in spots too, like if the top is orange and the bottom is blue and you have a hat, you have to dye the ball orange then put the hat on and then you're done! It's a 'must buy'!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|ted nonprofit Organization is great....i like these lecture speeches...i liked...spechely bfiewf fwefw fwefew fewfw fwefw fwfwef fwefw weft wefewf fwd
0440246016|5.0|I love the Jack Reacher books. Can not put them down.  They are compulsively addictive and keep you guessing at every turn of the page.  Lee Child is a superb craftsman of suspense.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I just downloaded it. I had pictures that needed to be crop. After reading a review;I follow directions and have successfully crop my pictures. If nothing else works cropping pictures is a plus.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|The first of the series.  I'm surprised it took me so long to get to it.  I'm glad I did though.  I can already start to see how the character matures through the series.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Recently I lost my big ginger and white tom. I've been sad and depressed for two weeks hoping he'd come home, but knowing I'd never see him again. This book and the story James tells of his love of Bob helped me deal with my own grief.<br /><br />Not only is Bob a wonderful cat, but James is a sensitive person with a strong love for animals. When he took on the responsibility of adopting Bob, he knew he had to become a more responsible person. Many pet owners (who btw don't live on the streets) are less dedicated. Bob flourished not only because James fed him and gave him a warm place to sleep, he flourished because James loved him.<br /><br />Thank you for writing this book and for giving me a small piece of solace.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|I very much liked the first (Raiders) and the third (Holy Grail) movies.  The Crystal Skull has a Saga-Ending story line with top characters but it is a bit canned ham.  You can almost see the &#34;Story Board&#34; movement in the film and at times I felt like I was going from one frame set to another.  Still, its the Saga Ending film for Harrison and well worth adding to my Indiana Jones library.  I will watch it as much as the others and you really cannot separate this film off from the rest.  Not as good as we all hoped but as good as the producers took time to make it and its much more entertaining than the 2nd film (Temple).  Thank you Stephen & Kathleen for taking the time to finish this series out.  I rank the series films from best to worst:  Raiders, Search for the Grail, Crystal Skull, and last, Temple of Doom.  Will we ever see another nostalgic adventure as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark?  I hope so.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The worst part about the show is you have to wait a week to see the next episode.  Yeah BBCAmerica
B008JF8O9M|4.0|Will have to see how well it stands up.  To print a document seems like a difficult process and wouldn't be for a beginner.  It has a long way to go to be as integrated as a full OS print function.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This movie was extremely entertaining! I loved it! Great music! Great cast! Anna Kendrick and Brittany Snow have incredible voices!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This is a good Bruce Willis movie that actually has some new elements, along with the good ol' yippy ki yi yay.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it's a great game with easy rules for all family members. fun graphics with great interaction. love the look and play
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This like sooooooooooooooooooooooooo close to the real movie. I am having like a fun time playing this game. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Get It, it's a fun game, that has a lot of challenge. Great game, worth the download, and I mean it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and enjoyable for all ages even my little one likes it. Great game for when nothing better to do anywhere.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This game was a waste of my time and waste of unnecessary bandwidth. Launching this application made all of my other functions useless.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This was a good reading. I personally started reading it because I thought the movie was very scarce on details. This book fills some gaps but still, the events are not really explained. You need to keep reading on the next books.<br /><br />A couple of details that are important on the plot appear here, but were left out in the movie. I recommend it only if you will commit to read the whole trilogy.<br /><br />If you are only reading this one book, go somewhere else.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows ever.  Season 3 is fantastic, but I think season 2 outshines it by far.  Still, I can't wait for Season 4.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I actually had low expectations because so many other reviews were marking this book as just a filler between the first and the last. This is not the case. It gracefully lays out whatever gaps coming from the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and creates quite a nice plot.<br /><br />This is no masterpice. However, I did enjoy it and let me wanting for more.<br /><br />If you read the first one, this book is a must
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Slow at first but prizes add up to give additional coins.  Don't sell prizes. They will accumulate to generate additional coin opportunities.  Wish I could find instructions to the game. Is there strategy to determine which prize/ puzzle piece falls next?
B008NEMN0K|5.0|Amazing 3D, full of action.  Good story line, a bit confusing but great ending.<br />Will Smith does not disappoint, especially his nude body. Not a kid movie.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I have Findle Fire HD. I got this app from Free app of the day. This app is decent. You can get photos from your Facebook and gallery. You can just take a picture on the spot. You can share it on Facebook. The reason why I gave it a 4 star because when you want to add a text you can't make it that big. It's still tiny even though it's the biggest they have. Other photo editors you can make it much bigger. But yeah it's a good app. I hope they fix that though. Then It will be five stars.<br />~Cynthia~
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I purchased this app to help me sync my kindle fire hd with my office calendar on google.  It doesn't work, will not sync, so don't waste your time and money.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Amazing. I can't really say any more about it. Traveling with the Doctor and Rose, I just loved it.  It is a must watch.
B000A59PMO|4.0|Purchased for a class assignment.  I was apprehensive at first, however the cast and storyline kept me and my family interested.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Acting great!!!  Story fascinating!!  We looked forward to watching every epidsode! Love all the characters in this outstanding series.  Highly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a fun game where you take care of the horses you have (without all the work!) I love playing this and I recommend getting it!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|As I wrote in my previous review of this series, we love it!!  Acting and story oustanding!  You will enjoy watching every minute!  One of the characters named &#34;Louis&#34; sure makes you love/ hate him.....he's great along with the two lead stars!!  Looking forward to Season 3.
0451228375|5.0|Not  what you would expect from  his previous books. It was one of the best books I have ever read.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|The pace, writing, characters and story were great - all things I love about George RR Martin's Game of Thrones. Now I can't wait to read Book 5 and catch up with the other characters I had come to know and love!
0525952926|5.0|This was a much awaited book.  Could not wait to read it. Kept me spellbound thru the whole book.<br /> Very anxious for the third book to  released.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I liked the Battle.<br />I recommend this book to adventure fans.<br />I chose this rating because this book was very interesting.
B007IK44CK|5.0|I watch movies while walking on the treadmill.  The movie was so capturing and entertaining, I forgot I was walking.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Beautiful story and easy to get into.  Complicated relationship between many family members but love in the end come through.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked it.  Not your typical \\"coming of age\\" young adult type book.  I thought the characters were well developed and intriguing.  The plot had plenty of twists and turns to keep it interesting.  I also have the other books in the series which are currently loaned to my niece who also likes this genre.  I bought them in paperback and have really enjoyed them, they are certainly worth a re-read.  I just hope the movie can come close.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was good it was also good movie in my preference the book was great i would recommend this book to every reader
B003274QH6|5.0|From episode 1 to episode 7 you are in for a ride. The best pilot you've ever seen it's in this Blu-ray. This is worth more than what Amazon.com  is charging and I sure would pay more for it if I had no choice. Luckily I have a choice and so do you. BUY IT!
B003Y5H574|3.0|Nice and funny movie but most especially i love the fashion part of the movie like some of the suits Ryan was wearing and Steve is funny as usual .
B005LZWA5W|5.0|This movie is just AMAZING. This remastered blu-ray can't look better. I just feel this is the kind of classic that has to be in the shelf for the family and friends to watch anytime. I strongly recommend.*The box is recycled.
B008MM9630|5.0|My kids love this game we play it all of the time  I don't spend cash on it but that's up to the player I can't spend money on it but it's still fun for us and great new stuff is added all the time. I love the great  details
B0030T1NAO|5.0|As crystal meth is addictive this show is. It's got great drama, great performances and I just can't stop watching! I strongly recommend to everyone, expect children. The Blu-ray is alright! I've seen better.
B00000J0O2|5.0|OEM package, and it works fine and much less expensive than purchasing from Staples, Office Depot or other office supply house
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I love this Album. When it came out I got so hooked and I still am. Also I got it for an amazing price. So I strongly recommend.
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|Four and a half stars for the music that IS on the CD; minus one star for the music that ISN'T. The music on the CD is hauntingly lovely. I just wish the producers had issued a complete \\"Original Movie Soundtrack\\" CD, instead of the incomplete \\"Music FROM the motion picture\\" (my  caps). Eighteen songs on the CD but, sadly, nineteen missing and I'd love to hear them, without having to watch the movie again (I've watched it three times and will likely watch it again...it's that good.) The missing tunes (no Hawaiian accent marks): Jean's Theme, An Artist's Vision, Papa Sia, Poli Ahu, Interlude with Ukulele, Holo Ka A, Pua Lani, In Ya System, Night Blooming Cereus, Miss Bea, Pua Hone, Wonderland, Nani Wai Ale Ale, Pine Tree Slack Key, Sanoe, The Yodel Song, Faith In Rain, Hummingbird Heart, The Harshest Place on Earth. I would gladly have paid double for a second CD with these songs...
B0017HMF6W|4.0|Sure I love Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock but this is not a Blu-ray I want to own. The only reason I bought it is because my brother absolutely loves it and has in fact seen more times than I have. I like this movie I do and if you like it buy it it's good but I rather own other things. :)
B008Y76VW2|2.0|It sounded interesting but it was not to me. It was listed as a comedy but there was not anything funny in that I saw.  I only watched half and then found something better to watch. Glad I did not pay to see it.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I love this album! Every song is really enjoyable and danceable and I just have a great time listening to it. Unfortunately, I had shipping problems with Amazon.com but they were more than nice about it and for that I am grateful and happy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is captivating. The more you watch the installments, the more involved you become with the characters and the plot, the more enjoyable it becomes.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|It's incredible the twists that go on in this shows. Your in for a wild ride. I strongly recommend this Blu-ray. This is the kind of show that I can sit and watch over and over again. They also put so much work into the blu-ray and detail. It's worth every penny.
0783240287|4.0|be ready that the scenes are not nearly as expansive as what you see on stage.  It's the closest thing, though.  Kids loved it.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|Paramore has a four discs if I'm not mistaking and I love 3 of them but this one is just the one that made me fall in love with that band. I your getting to know Paramore buy this disc first. If you already know paramore buy this disc anyway. It's worth every penny!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This author took me to new places and entertained me for sure, but also created a whole new perspective for me in my relationship with my dog. It's amazing. I've always thought I could tell what she was thinking, but now our communication is on a much higher level and it's scary! I'm naturally a compassionate pet owner/master to her, and now I know how I might see her and treat her when her time is up. I'm inspired by this book in other ways too, such as taking the lessons from the racetrack and using them in golf and in life. This story is an incredible mix of imagination, perspective, heart, commitment, love, and philosophy. I don't necessarily believe in reincarnation as the dog does, but its fun to think in those terms while reading the book and allow myself to be taken for this great ride. I purposely did not read this book in one sitting, although it was tempting. I read a couple of short chapters per night at bedtime, enjoyed the nightly escape from the real world, and listened to my dog each morning way more than before. Enjoy!
B0058YPGL6|5.0|When I bought this Amazon.com had a different picture for the cover of the first Season and then I get this picture and my mind it's blown away. Usually I get pissed at this stuff but I just love the artwork it's more simple than the one it had and it looks professional instead of cheap. Plus this is a GREAT show and it's worth every penny. I just wish it would've been released on blu-ray! This is the picture Amazon had when I bought this:[...]
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app.  Use it everyday. Better than the TV<br />It,s nice to be able to get your location asap
B00AEFXEN6|5.0|This movie is kind of messed up but so funny and dramatic at the same time. It's the kind of movie you want to own if you're a movie lover. It's a work of art!<br /><br />This blu-ray is amazing. The quality is really good. The only thing I didn't like is that the blu-ray disc has no artwork. It's light grey except the in the name area where the disc is naked.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Wow....this extraordinary effort to convey the importance of the Neve board & all of the etheric & wondrous musicality from which it conjured...well, this effort went off without a hitch. Dave Grohl stayed out of the way and consequently made the most of wide open spatials within the context of his story-telling. As an aside, I had no idea that Rick Springfield was actually a musician...I thought of him as more of a pop star with an average talent and exceptional looks and luck...but no, he actually frickin rocks along with the rest of em. This is a film that really should be seen by essentially the entire planet.
B0053O89XI|5.0|Funniest show I've ever seen! Got it for the amazing price of $19.99! Yes only $19.99! So if you get the chance buy this like NOW! Bu-ray quality is just amazing!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|the can people say, all the metal gears, since nes to today, you can't ask more for 50 bucks, buy it.
B0049P1ZZQ|3.0|The Walking Dead is one of my favorite TV Shows right now. The first season, which is composed of only 6 episodes, it's not my favorite season. I bought this season because I want to own the entire series but I would've just bought Season 2 and Season 3 instead. Regardless I recommend because there is, in fact, way more people that differ my opinion.<br /><br />I takes you about 4 episodes to start caring for the characters but when you do, you can't stop.<br /><br />I had a problem with Amazon.com and that was that I didn't get the cardboard sleeve that comes with the blu-ray to protect it. I called and returned it and they sent me the same thing. Finally, they ended up giving me a promo. So problem solved I guess. But I'm still disappointed because I didn't get the cardboard protective sleeve. It makes the blu-ray look and feel better.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Everything about this movie is good, especially the acting. Juaquin and Reese at their best! I have already seen it. Wanted to own it
B0058YPG2K|5.0|One of the best shows on TV right now! You never know what to expect and you're always wrong if you expect anything to happen. Blu-ray is AMAZING strongly recommend.
B005MJ883K|5.0|this is a good toy for people with patience to try again and again. We play with it all the time, and never get tired.
B0063IH60K|3.0|This puzzle is fun and I do enjoy it but the same puzzle comes up too often.  Can't you get more formats so that the same puzzle doesnt remeat as often?
B00594XOZU|3.0|I loved the app it's just after a while it logged me and I hadn't used my password in so long that I forgot and I couldn't get back in
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's the best game ever when I first played I knew it would've been fun. I love guess the emoji pop
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have a confession to make. Although I am a high-school literature teacher, I cannot stand most of the contemporary YA novels that my students read and talk about. I try, I really do, but all that follows is disappointment. Hunger Games started well, but crashed and burned as the series progressed. That's more than can be said for Matched or Divergent, books that stumbled at the starting line. My faith for the next generation of readers dwindled.....I asked myself, \\"Would they ever have a book worthy of being read by generations to follow?\\" An ambitious question, I know, but an important one. After all, my generation had \\"The Giver\\" and \\"Hatchet,\\" which are heavily taught in schools today. Well, Millennials, I have good news for you; you now have your once-in-a-generation YA novel.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is the rare book that doesn't talk down or present a dumbed-down world to its target audience. John Green presents the world as it is today, with its pain, its ugliness, and its beauty. And he presents two teenagers who memorize poetry, wax philosophically, obsess over obscure books, and contemplate oblivion; though these types of kids may seem rare today (thank you 24-hour news cycles and reality television for failing to present the Millennials in any but the most negative of lights); in my experience, this type of teenager is far more common than adults are led to believe.<br /><br />The critics of this book surely have some qualms about this novel. Allow me to counter these well-meaning yet misguided critics: Yes, this book has teenage drinking; yes, this book presents teenage sex; yes, this book features teenagers dying. But John Green presents all three of these with a care and a delicacy that would give teenage readers time to pause and contemplate(by the way, teens are hardly an impressionable and naive group, as they are exposed to these concepts in far more vulgar ways everywhere else they look in the world today).<br /><br />Furthermore, thisnovel features no vampires or otherworldly beings, no ill-conceived love triangles, no damsel-in-distress, no unnecessary, bloated sequels, and, most thankfully, no young protagonists forced to kill in order to save the world from some dystopian nightmare. The impact these young protagonists leave might be minimal in their own fictional yet all-too-familiar world (which they themselves admit in the novel), but their impact on my life, and on the lives of countless other readers of this book, is substantial.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great app for kids, keeps them entertained if they love horses. Good graphics. Easy to use if your kids can read.  Not recommended for very young children.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|This app is great, but where are the photos that we save and edit.<br />I tried to find by the gallery and searching files and no lucky.
B00821OX98|5.0|i missed some of the 1st season so was so excited when we could get it on amazon prime and this season is excellent and i would recommend to any one.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It is a great way to work on your inner strengths and learn you can do anything you want to.
B001RTSPVY|4.0|I fell in love with this series in Season One.  The first few episodes particularly were very smart and quite hilarious.  I totally bought the outrageous premise that a mild-mannered Walter Mitty type would morph into an aggressive drug dealer.  The actors were all good and I enjoyed the different personalities.  As far-out as the idea was, the script was so well written and acted that it seemed actually plausible as well as being highly entertaining.<br /><br />In Season Two, Walt had already grown into his new greedy self and there's not as much fun in watching it. I missed the humor and wit.  But it's interesting, from a psychological perspective to watch Walt coming into his power.  Apparently this is a man with some kind of Bad Mom who has married a woman who perpetuates the problem. Early on in the first season we see Skyler feeding Walt some sort of limp strips of vegetarian bacon. Ha. He eats it, uncomplainingly of course, just as he eats her repeated disrespect and that of his teen aged son who looks to the hyper-macho uncle as a role model.  Jesse got Skyler's number the first time he met her when he later referred to her as a \\"nutcracker.\\"  Poor Walt doesn't quite get that yet and he caves in to her time and time again.  The episode with the \\"talking pillow\\" was amazing!<br /><br />By Season Two, Walt has descended into the underworld to reclaim some of his lost power. (Shades of Dante and Carl Jung!)  But he's still a little wobbly in his use of power.  He still caves into his wife but explodes sometimes abusively, at Jesse.  It isn't a lot of fun to watch but it is psychologically credible.  The relationship with Jesse is the best part of the show in my opinion.  I love seeing them progress from incessant bickering to something much, much better.<br /><br />Jesse's romance with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door was a welcome change from the darkness of the drug dealers and the inanity of Skyler.  The Sklyer character is interesting in that she is so bloody annoying yet she is presented as Mrs. Perfect Wife.  No wonder the man got cancer!  He should have consulted a psychiatrist as well as an oncologist but that wouldn't have made such a good story.  This is no fault of the actress; she plays it perfectly and she looks just right.  I live near Albuquerque and I could see Skyler in any of the local malls. She just made me want to scream, that's all.<br /><br />So was a relief, even visually to see  Jesse fall in love with Jane, the Girl-Next-Door, 21st Century, Albuquerque version. This Jane wears all black, talks tough and works in a tatoo shop in Nob Hill. (You can see Janes all over Nob Hill, in black boots, smoking cigarettes and, for some reason I've never understood they favor wearing straight black bangs.)  I liked the whole sequence with Jane and her Dad, the air traffic controller.  It brought back the elements of love and tenderness that the show needed to balance the violence. There's a great scene in a bar where the two dads who've met by chance talk about their daughters.  It's beautifully written and it ties in wonderfully with the following sequences where we see, literally, the \\"fall-out\\" of the incident with Jane.<br /><br />I fell in love with Jesse Pinkman, early on in Season One and he continued to hold my heart through Season Two.  Not to push the symbolism too far, but I  see him, the pink-man, as representing a true tender heart while Walter White is all bound up in being Mr. White. The poor guy gets beat up over and over but he manages to keep his heart open.  He took the rap for the joint, saving his younger brother, and he went out of his way to help the poor red-headed child of the wasted druggies.  Over and over he takes the heat from Walt, who is still caught in rigid Mr. White self-righteousness.  Until finally even Walt's heart melts at Jesse's problems and instead of yelling at him, he helps him.<br /><br />Actually the more I've ruminated about Season Two the more I've decided that it contains some great moments and Ive revised my intial three star score to four. It isn't as much fun as Season One and there are a lot of tedious scenes, mostly involving the doctors and Skyler and I saw more close ups of Walt's very tense face than I cared to see.  But it's still intelligent TV and worth seeing.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My daughter wrote the original review of this app and she is one of three who love to play it.  It's easy enough for my six year old, and still fun for my 11 year old.  However, I have found it to cause problems and have had to unload and then reload it more than once.  I don't intend to load again if the issues are not fixed.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|Like this show a lot, but could do without the overdone sex scenes. There are at least three per episode!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This movie was not what I expected, however, Matthew McConaughey does a great job.  I really enjoyed it and would highly recommend it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Love it! I play every night before I lay down...<br />Relaxes me...<br />I enjoy the FREE game.<br />I enjoy playing others (online).
B004LPLU4K|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. I feel it has alot of similarities and feel of the original writing.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|hard for me to understand need to watch it again good graphics and  action , but could't keep up with what was going on
B005HED08I|5.0|While there were flaws in individual episodes (and yeah it is 60s heavy) ST:TOS is the one that started it all.  No Next Gen No DS9 No Voyager No Enterprise.  Think about it.  If NBC had the data that it has today concerning viewership of a program ST:TOS would have been on for 10 years or more.  ST:TOS was a revolution in TV and SF.  It was positive and it was a way of saying we would overcome the petty little things that are flumoxxing the leaders of this world and we would survive to reach the 23rd Century.  In the words of Siskel and Ebert.....TWO BIG THUMBS UP!!!!
1559210540|5.0|I read Miss Hanff's story many years ago and never forgot it.  So, when I found it on Amazon I couldn't make my fingers move fast enough to order this.<br />It is a true story written by the author and recounts her relationship to a bookstore in England.  The story is told by the letters that were exchanged between the bookstore (at first) and then gradually becoming more personal with the people at the book store. It takes place when rationing was still in place in England so some of the letters are thank yous to Miss Hanff.  That's all I can tell you...you have to read for yourself.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Dawkins knows his facts about evolution and presents them well; however, I fear that the best that we can hope for is that he will slow down the deniers who are trying to influence those responsible for selecting books for school boards.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Is there anyone who does NOT know about Downton Abbey?  This is just a well written story that shows upstairs downstairs relationships, the history of the times, and of course some skull duggery!  Worth the watch!!!
B002MG2ATY|2.0|The entire premise was summarized in Costner's 10-minute speech at the end. Interesting conspiracy theory, although not convincing. Good acting on Costner's part, but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy the film.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have read very widely on the subject of Law of Attraction and quantum theories.  This is one of the most useful in terms of Do-it-yourself easy to follow techniques.  It is a must read if you want to bring your thoughts into reality.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This is one of my favorite romcom's ever. Great plot, great twist, great acting...definitely worth renting or buying. Check it out
B000009ED0|5.0|I bought this to replace my broken CD.  I missed it.  Every song kicks it and is just so great, and now that it's 15 yrs old, it's a classic.  Yeah, 15 years!
B000002GYR|4.0|Good songs. I did have no trouble receiving the tape .Everything went well .I would buy this tape again and would recommend it to anyone.
B000000OQF|5.0|I'm replacing some CD's that I wore out, and this was one of them.  This CD is so classic; it's in the top ten albums...ever.  Every song is so original.  Too bad GnR burned out so quickly.  The real GnR.
B001KQBFAM|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the movie. It was nice to see how Internal Investigations got it's start, although from what I understand by way of a cop friend of mine, it is still necessary. I must admit the dancing at the party was a real treat!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun game! Reminds me of the good old days!<br />I'm not sure I understand what the gifts are for but very fun game nonetheless
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love this game  My 8 yr old and 6 yr old have learned how to play now and will never let me play though. Lol.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I've been using Lastpass for a long time and for the extremely cheap price it's nice to have access to my passwords without any hassle on my Kindle and on my phone. It was one of the first applications that I installed after my Kindle arrived. (Was very happy to see it come up in product search...I didn't know ahead of time if there was an amazon version of their android app!)
B00992CF6W|4.0|Quite a fun game, but the pocket edition is lacking some of the most fun features of its big brother for PC and XBox360.  Breeding is non-existent, and though the developer keeps saying they will add auto breeding it has yet to happen.  Other small details are lacking such as the names of the items needed for crafting.<br />Overall a fun experience at a fair price, but more polish and full features are needed for a 5 star rating.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|There's 2 main photo editors for mobile devices right now &quot;PicShop Pro&quot;  and &quot;PicSay Pro&quot; both have their good points and bad points. I use both apps and like them both alot.<br />PicShop has very little support as of now and PicSay Pro has good support as of now.<br />Try the free versions of both apps before you spend your money to judge for yourself which app better suits your needs. Like I said before I own both and use both depending on what I want/need to do to a picture. Photo touch-up and fixing PicShop Pro is better and PicSay Pro is better creating humorous and funny pictures from your photos.<br />Neither app's paid versions has adware or excessive permissions. If your like me you'll probably get both apps and quickly figure out which app is better for what your trying to do.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I love re-reading these classics on my Kindle Fire HD as revisiting old reads is like coming back to a familiar place.  It's been years since I read these as a young girl, and now have rekindled the fire (pardon the pun) of reading the classics for enjoyment once again.  Great for putting a charge in the ole memory bank and keeping your long term memory charged up.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Out standing app to have it is easy to set up and run even I was able to set it up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love the app. It gives some much information at one time in my area and in my other family areas. Its brest to be so updated.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Better than the movie! Get it and see for your self. Pretty intense and graphic in a good way! Try it.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I'm not able to save to SD Care and facebook is only sharing option visible. Without ability to save, I can't comment on image quality.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Season five was just as fantastic! I hated to see it come to an end.<br />It continued to have all the ingredients I look for. Action, Romance, and a Great Story Line....... It progresses at a reasonable rate and builds on each previous episode. I absolutely Loved It!!<br />I hope there will be more to come......
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Poignant and philosophical; this book may be my favorite read of the summer.  A story of young love between cancer patients. I knew it would end badly but it was a funny and insightful trip.
B00BGI086Q|5.0|I love this show as its filled with decent acting, GREAT action, dark concepts (not a lot of the cheese comics turned movies/TV shows get saddled with), and hot Stephen Amell! Ok so that last one isn't really the most important, but good lord Stephen is in great shape AND he does all the stunts that don't have too high of a risk. So all those montages of him working out (salmon ladder, rope etc) and parkouring his way away from the bad guys is really him! Ok...I'll shut up about Stephen for a second. Perhaps the most important factor that makes season 1 so good is that its built a great format with lots of great plot twists that will even surprise some old school Green Arrow fans (without disappointing) and its set itself in a great position to have an amazing season 2.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|Great CD for Heavy Metal/Metallica fans...In fact, it is better than my expectations. Go and order it, you won't regret...One cool thing is Amazon sends the digital version immediately when you order the CD, so you can start to listen before the CD arrives...
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I couldn't put the book down it was so exciting. It give you the ins and outs of the secreat service and the protection service. I also love that these books have now become a TV series.
B005HE5J7I|4.0|WOW!  Mr. Rutherford really does his research.  It is so precise and detailed.  I especially like the way he segues from century to century so smoothly.  This book is also an excellent teaching resource.  It gives the facts about how London developed and uses some great stories to further the book along.  I would recommend it.
B0063S3DMK|5.0|THis is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Wish there were more like it.  Loved it!  best.
0451209338|5.0|The book was offered at a price that was acceptable. Arrived when expected and in the condition as described. So I am very pleased.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|Interesting take on the spiritual questions that plaque us one and all. And a good romance with enough balance between humor and tears. A definite favorite with me!
B0090SI4LU|5.0|Well having read the book I looked forward to the movie.  I really enjoyed it.  Wish the movie could have had more then it did but I understand the time limits involved.  I will look at it again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game that you will have you playing for hours. If you like Temple Run, the you will love this game. It is more amazing than any other game in its genre.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Hard to understand some of the words, but content was very good.  Disappointed that Thaddeus Stevens had to be in bed with his black housemaid .....that may have been true, but it made his passion for equality for all men diminished by personal prejudice.
B003BLPTB0|5.0|I wear these in my office. Looks \\"better for the office\\" than flip-flops and feels more comfortable that flip-flops or sandals. One of the most comfortable shoes I owned.
193700788X|1.0|What did I just read? I am a big Sookie Stackhouse fan and couldn't get enough of the other books. This book fell short on so many levels. It's Charlaine Harris' story and I know she can do with it what she wants but really Charlaine...I  mean, really...<br /><br />So, to be short and to the point here are my big problems:<br /><br />1. I'm going to use my one wish to get something that gives me one wish...ummm, okay, if you say so.<br /><br />2. I think I remember a character named Eric from the earlier books...I really do...I think he was important to the storyline, really, he was a big deal...he gets maybe 10 pages in the entire book. When he does show up its like it was written by somebody else - either that or Charlaine just HATES Eric and decided he wasn't worth her time or energy.<br /><br />3. Vampires in general are essentially absent from this book while every other character that has ever popped up in Bon Temps shows up and gets their storyline neatly wrapped up. I don't care that much if Quinn got married or if the other telepath guy (who means so much to me that I can't even remember his name) spent all his time since Dallas working for another vampire.<br /><br />4. Sam...really...I mean, really! and what was up with that love scene, it was weird and gross...definitely no Sookie/Eric shower scene there. It was like icky brother sister trailer park love - no thanks!<br /><br />But b/c I'm glutton for punishment so I will read the book that comes out in October to find out what happened to everyone. I will probably wish I hadn't but I know I will. Such good books through about number 7, the next few were still really good, but then you wrap up with this, I'm just disappointed (insert sigh).
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I LOVE the new jet ski and jet packs. To bad they got rid of the golden piggy bank jet pack I was close to getting it. Well it's still my favorite game I have.
B006LSZECO|4.0|compelling read, would recommend if anyone wanted a quick read while waiting at the airport, but this won't change your life.<br /><br />not to detract from other reviews, this is a great read, sped through it in a few hours, but just isn't something I'm running to force onto my friends/coworkers, which is what I normally reserve for 5 stars.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game I wonderful<br />It isn't slow at all<br />Two thumbs up<br />If you like playing games but you like playing against people than this game  is great for you .even if you lose the game they still reward you<br />And you will always be able to scratch off a ticket to win game points
B004SBS8LA|3.0|IT is ok, but to hard to move up. My grand kids like it, but get upset because it is to slow to move to next level.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun game to pass time. Everything works great. Games are fast so pay attention!! Not something you can play if someone is trying to talk to you at the same time. Haha!
B009GED3HS|5.0|This was one of the best HIMYM seasons.  I can't wait to see what happens in season 9.  I would recommend this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's a good confluence and a good idea to teach kids to take care of animals.And to learn about the on line world.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|SO on my S4....just like everyone else this app is kind of useless since it won't save to the camera roll or anywhere else I tell it to using the \\"CUSTOM\\" option in the save menu. It keeps trying to save under a non-existent /sd/ directory.<br /><br />Just for the heck of it, I installed the app on my old HTC Incredible running Android 2.3.7 that I rooted. IT WORKS!!! So the app will run beautifully for all of you running old school Android.<br /><br />Or maybe we just need to be rooted so the app can make up whatever folder structure it thinks should be on our phones. Anyone have a rooted S4 that's tried this app out to verify this last bit?
0345803485|5.0|E.L.James is very detailed, to the point where you can envision the characters as if<br />they were real! The in depth storyline captures you're attention to the point where<br />you feel like you are apart of it! Every chance I got I picked up this book so I can<br />read it ...5 stars plus!!!
B00030DEQE|5.0|Great Product fixed my issue right away. Easy to install and went to work with complete easy guide and protocol
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I didn't want to watch this at first .. but then I did and I was really glad I did.  If you like the first episode, you'll love them all.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|I chose this rating because the book helped me look at our mental mindsets from a different perspective. Rather than ranting about positive attitudes, the book discusses the differences between having a fixed mindset and a growth mindset and how if you want to succeed in life, you have to work for it. That's right no wishful thinking just good old fashion hard work and effort.
B0060MYK7G|4.0|May not be as good as some of the better HBO series - but it is entertaining!  Eager for season 3.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Excellent I've always been a fan and this is an awesome deal on BluRay. The original series rocks! Way to go Amazon. H
B009WUBERW|3.0|If you remember these action heroes and enjoyed their films, I think you will enjoy there reliving those good ol' days.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game so much!!! this is one of my favorite games... like ever. this game /app is worth the download!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|A little book with a big message, you'll be able to read this book in one sitting. Be sure to let the ideas hang out in your brain for a while to get the most from the message.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I'm really enjoying playing Uno. The opponents are competitive.<br />Thanks for putting it out there. Only one more thing to say &quot;UNO&quot;!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Was not sure at first.  After that, I was hooked.  Then on to season 2 and now to 3.  I am almost caught up and need to find another show to watch.  Wish it wasn't true.
B003XRELEI|2.0|I love Vonnegut. He is my favorite author. But this one, I didn't care for at all. It's been written the this is his most autobiographical novel. Maybe that's why it seems too selfish, too inside of himself.<br />I ever saw the movie version and now I know I never will willingly watch it. I almost never regret buying a kindle book, but i regret ths one. At least it was a quick read.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I have not used it but I always watch veveo vids on youtube quick loading when you skip does not lag but I know dis app is gonna be awesome oop done with the download
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is easy the clock is very simple and fun to use I would tell everybody to get this app

B001DHXT1G|5.0|I think this is the best look Hulk out of all the movies, since the man himself Lou F. Awesome
1400052181|5.0|I purchased this book for my high school senior who's AP Biology class was required to read this over the summer. The book looked so interesting that I decided to read it when she was finished. I did not understand - until I read the book myself - why this would be a required reading for a Biology class. I totally understand now. A fascinating story that actually makes biology make sense to those of us that are not scientifically inclined. Highly recommend to anyone interested in a great read....
0857685848|5.0|I can't think of enough superlatives to use to describe my opinion of \\"Dinosaur Art: The World's Greatest Paleoart.\\" This is, quite simply, one of the most incredible books I've seen in many years. I first came across it, securely shrink-wrapped in plastic, in a bricks-and-mortar bookstore. The vibrant artwork on the cover attracted me from across the store, and when I felt the heft of the slim but heavy volume, I knew it was something special.<br /><br />What a book it is! The quality of the artwork between its sturdy covers just blew me away. The production values are absolutely first-rate. The images, including several multiple-page foldout panoramas, are razor-sharp and breathtaking. I found myself staring at each of them for literally minutes, trying to extract the maximum amount of information and marveling at the amount of work the artist put into creating each one. The colors are phenomenal--and, naturally, mostly speculative, since no one knows how dinosaurs were patterned and marked (with one exception that the book illustrates and explains). While the focus of \\"Dinosaur Art\\" is on the artwork, of course, the interviews with the artists are also fascinating. Some of them reveal exactly how certain works came to be, and how our understandings of the dinosaurs they illustrated evolved over the years. All are interesting and inspirational.<br /><br />Artistic media represented in \\"Dinosaur Art\\" include pencils, pen-and-ink, gouache, oils, acrylics and digital. Styles range from relatively loose to stunningly photo-realistic. And the subjects run the gamut from small bird-like dinosaurs to the biggest of the big sauropods. I had never heard of most of the creatures, but that didn't stop me from enjoying these remarkable images of them in the environments they inhabited.<br /><br />\\"Dinosaur Art\\" is an amazing book. Anyone who has ever wondered what the earth might have looked like in the days before a six-mile-in-diameter asteroid slammed into the Gulf of Mexico 65 million years ago and wiped out most life on the planet, should find it of immense interest. If you have the slightest curiosity about dinosaurs, paleontology or gorgeous, cutting-edge speculative art, it should occupy a place of honor on your bookshelves. In my opinion, \\"Dinosaur Art\\" is the book of the century (so far).co 65 million years ago and wiped out most life on the planet, should find it of immense interest.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|If you could accrue more tokens faster would be helpful. However; I, like the fact you can get prizes with bananas!
1881273156|5.0|This book is very helpful. It makes you aware of things in your relationship. Great advice! I would definitely recommend to any  couple that have been together for 3 years or 30 years!  It might just bring things back to life for you!
B009GX6SSK|5.0|This is a great spin-off of the more traditional NCIS.  It is interesting to see what undercover agents must do and how talented they are to adapt.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is awesome! but a little on the dirty side lol Good if you are single. But I would not recommend reading it if you are in a relationship.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It is fun to play but extremely challenging in the higher levels of the game. I highly recommend it bought.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|It's so nice with no commercials.  All I expected.  Have recommended it to two of my friends.  Will enjoy it fow years to come.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|Its a cartoon with actors. But sometimes that just what you want. If you want to sit back and watch stuff blow up and butts get kicked. this is a great flick.
B005MLOKXA|3.0|I really enjoy this show, but get very frustrated by all the reloading interruptions.  Might as well just turn it off once it starts reloading because it continues every few minutes for the rest of the show!!!!!  Please fix this!!!!!!
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|My kids love the Lego brand and franchises. This is A fun short film made using cut scenes from the Lego batman 2 game. Silly fun with some cool \\"nerd\\" references here and there. (Me being the comic nerd)
B009DCOU9S|1.0|After I down loaded it and after playing it for a while I put it to the side. I could be wrong but my battery life was going at a faster rate then ever before, even when not playing it.  So I deleted it from my kindle. I don't like it for that reason. I could be wrong on this game doing that, but it happen after I down loaded it. So you be the judge of it after down loading it.
B00873GRU4|5.0|A good scifi yarn, well constructed and keeps the pace going. Makes you not want to put it down. Excellent
B00CRVZRUS|3.0|I love this movie, but it is the same as the box set that came out a few years ago.the forward from the directer is from that box set. the picture quality is the same as well. OK Beatles you got another 20 bucks from me. if you don't own that box set buy this. if you do, don't waste your money
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's like Dallas for Brits. Love it! You never know what will happen next! Can't wait for the next season.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|My venture into indie publishing started when I heard about John Locke's success.  John made me brave enough to join Kindle Direct Publishing and make an ebook of my first book [[ASIN:B0094V6UKA Emotional Health for Emotional Wealth: The View from A Therapist's Office]]  Since then I have published nineteen other self help ebooks.  Thank you John Locke because your experience and wise words gave me the courage to try.  Now I sell enough ebooks to know that my work is helping other people.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|Excellent - you forget the nationality and just see them as men in a war in a submarine - could have been from any country.  One of my top 100 movies.
B009NX61JY|5.0|A great film with an amazing cast and a good storyline. This movie hits home for those of us who grow up in the shadow of our gorgeous mothers and/or siblings. Love it!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I love the entire album and I seem to be able to put it on repeat forever.  I hadn't purchased an album from anyone in ten years and I highly recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is good game for a small break. It challenges my ability to think quickly and that is a good thing!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Classic game which is what I wanted. Easy to use, gives feedback on time and moves, and tracks ones best time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love, love, love this series - I don't know why it took me so long to check it out but it is worth every minute!!
B001AW156U|3.0|the product delivered was similar but not the same as the one shown.  it works okay but has a tendency to pop off.  it came with free thumbstick covers that work okay as well, so it wasn't a total loss.
0345803507|4.0|Its like a story book life.  Going from a budget life to a life that gives you all the material wants and the love of a man that everyone seems to want.  I was only going to get the first book and see if I would like it but, my  neighbor convinced me to buy all three.  I sure am glad I did.  The bookw came in good shape.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I play this game more often than I would like to admit. its fun and unlike some similar games there is somewhat a change of scenery in parts. very cute
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It serves my purpose 100 percent!!!!!! And the best thing is...... it's without expense.  Lol!!  Kindlers try it and experience it firsthand
B00992CF6W|4.0|This game is great but I think they should upgrade it because I play it on the Xbox360 but it's not the same  like u don't have as many items my friend deleted all her world's now she just has a empty world I asked why she said its not fun any more and she said its a waste of money
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I would watch this repeatedly because of the acting.  Jamie Foxx did an outstanding job BUT the real gem was Christoph Waltz.
0316247545|5.0|I bought this for my Brony daughter who has been a fan of MLP since age 3. It has ALL the info &#34;anypony&#34; would ever need. I have never been disappointed in the My LIttle Pony brand. IT has actually allowed my daughter to grow with it.  Awesome characters and stories.!
B004AQR29C|5.0|Great action movie.  It is good to see all of these actors working together...very entertaining for a night at home with popcorn and a cold &#34;beverage&#34;....
B008LV8TSU|1.0|I did not care for this book.  I have no idea why so many people love it.  I have to respect the fact that lots of people connect to it though.  It's not poorly written, though the pacing, in my opinion, is torturously slow.  I have to assume that I am just not the target audience for this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The Third Season was very poignant with strong feelings and tension between the nobility in the upstairs and the servants in  the downstairs  at Downton Abbey. Love blossoms in spite of the class differences. The characters are both loathsome and endearing.<br />Each day I could not wait to open my Kindle and catch up with the unpredicatble and emotional happenings.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|The only negative to this game, besides being a complete waste of time, is that it is addictive.  I find myself constantly telling myself &#34;just one more game&#34; and then continuing to play for another fifteen or twenty minutes.  It is entertaining, a little challenging, and definitely do-able for just about any age.
0307474259|3.0|I was interested in a book by this author as I had tried to do the Atkins diet which is similar to Taubes way of thinking.  I am about half way through the book but it's just okay.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat.... can't wait for next season! The end was griping and sadly prophetic.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I love seek and find games and this one is so very awesome unlike the other games out there with these games there are so many different levels to these types of games. i would reccomend this game to all of my friends and family
B0001Z37HM|3.0|Good movie; the Conan films with Arnold are a little more action packed, but this film had some good action in it, too.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|7 year old loves Sponge Bob and this stuffed Gary was a really inexpensive gift that she was/is super excited about. You get exactly what you see in the photo.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|I thought it was a funny movie.  I just wish that the characters were less gorgeous.  But I love Paul Rudd.  I'll inspect his hemorrhoids any time.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing Spider and this app makes it easy to move your cards for a fast paced game.  Love it and if you like spider, this app works really well.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This was a great movie. Do not watch if you do not want to pay attention, but it will keep you guessing and has a good ending
B00785P2QC|4.0|good entertaining free game to download hours of entertainment and enjoyment good deals on download packs one of the. cheapest so far
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Really brings back memories tho I don't like being told that I have a 20word minimum review Dr as adds to go back and Chris Matthews and falls
B009GEEMLY|5.0|if you have not seen this, you are missing out. Robert downey jr is unbelievably good as Iron man, Sleeper star of this film is Hawkeye.. forget the actors name, but he has been in other action movies and he is really dynamic.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Highly recommend - the twists keep you guessing as you turn every page.  The time travel to another era brought a history lesson of a time long forgotten but with an entertaining on the edge of your seat story.
1931559317|4.0|I like this Atlas for quick reference and for times when portability is paramount. It is well organized, the lay out is good, and production quality high. It's like a small version of Sky Atlas 2000.0.
B00E8B1358|4.0|I'm not sure why everyone dogged this movie so much, i liked it. It was very entertaining and action packed but not much more than that. What would you really expect from a G.I. Joe movie?  A million times better than the first.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|This is one unique show, ahead of its time.  The music is great too.  Julee Cruise is unique herself and worth a listen.
161218412X|5.0|The printing quality was exactly what I hoped for.  Good size fond, excellent illustrations, durable bonding.  Overall it's a tasteful set of books, and it feels like they can last a long time and be passed on to future generations.
B00C7KYXHW|4.0|I was a bit skeptical when I heard they were making a Hannibal TV series. all tv shows based on movies, and popular mythos seem to loose the whole point, or water down the product... But with Hannibal, I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised!  It's dark, creepy, and very well done.  Can't wait for season 2!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I could not exaggerate my high regard for this amazing book. Reza Aslan manages to peel away, ever so gently, the layers of myth surrounding Jesus. This is a courageous enterprise, given the fact that die-hard adherents to those myths will deny the truth of Aslan's scholarship. But this naked truth of the man in his context is the product of exhaustive research and well-reasoned conclusions, presented in lively, page-turning prose. At long last.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am an addict and I need rehab. I love the travel and photo boards and I get sucked in and then find a worm hole and its over for me. !!!!!
0385523394|5.0|I go to women's prisons in TX with Kairos and Storybook and so the story is an intesting look at the behind the scenes activities.
B00CKBCRO4|5.0|Having been first introduced to Sandel in a classroom with his work Justice, i can extoll, with great certainty, the value of this book in a learning environment. With references to \\"The Good Life\\" intermixed with discussion-forming material, this book marks another success in Sandel's attempts to engage audiences in dynamic, constructive, and introspective conversations. In this style, Sandel calls into question not only our personal beliefs on such subjects as life insurance policies and stadium naming rights, but also the much more deeply-seated societal beliefs and issues these practices can engender. For if ever there were to be a solution found to the balance between market ideals and those more removed from individual profit, it shall surely never be found without debate and discussion at every level.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I LOVED the inner banter of Pat Peoples. The simplistic complexity of his journey was brilliant. The dialogue throughout the book was fantastic. I enjoyed this book very much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great addictive game to pass the time. Every so often you even visit new places which keeps things interesting.I got it for basically everything you could put it on. My phone, my kindle fire HD, etc.
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Amazing live show in Hyde Park in London. Bruce and the E Street Band give everything they have as usual. This was the last show I saw Clarence play so I was extremely appreciative that this live show was taped and edited so well. Sounds and looks amazing on my 46\\" TV and surround sound system. Highly recommend!!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|The dude never fails to deliver a laugh. This movie is so funny and I would recommend this to anyone needing a good laugh.
140006922X|1.0|Why is it that sensationalist, poorly researched and poorly argued books like this keep on getting so much attention? I suspect that it is because they peddle simplistic narratives not overly unsettled by the complexities of reality and of real scholarship, on the one hand. On the other I think it is because they strike a nerve and tell us a story some of us want to hear. In this case the story some of us want to hear is that the Jesus of the gospels and Christian tradition did not exist, and was something in fact much more mundane, much more run of the mill, and much less disturbing and radical then the Jesus of Christian tradition. If you want to read an excellent scholarly book on Jesus that integrates both historical scholarship and serious confrontation with Christian views of Jesus in a brilliant way, read Gerhard Lohfink's &#34;Jesus of Nazareth.&#34; But skip this, it really is a waste of your time.
B001NZH9GY|2.0|I'm a big fan of old movies and Greta Garbo was a favorite, I found the quality of the film a bit grainy and didn't like the movie at all
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I thought it was a great syfy movie. The cinematography and CGI is beautiful. The music scored compliments the movie so well. I love the story and Tom Cruise and other cast members did a great job!
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|I rented Schindler's List because I wanted to see it again.  This film could easily qualify as a period piece, drama, history, documentary, romance, and action movie.  It is great literature, set to celluloid.  I grew up at a time when it was trendy for people to say that their favorite films were 'City Lights' or 'The Gold Rush' or 'Citizen Kane,' as if the truly great films were dusty and remote in time.  If that is true, it suggests that film is stagnant, that it has no evolutionary or growth potential, and that it never gets better.  As a viewer, observer and student of humanity, it is hard not to appreciate the story of redemption that is captured by 'Schindler's List,' or the one spot of color that appears, for a short passage, in an otherwise black-and-white world, the color seen moving and alive, then buried and dead, or the good that arises from evil, like the Phoenix from the ashes, or the ashes themselves, that fall like snowflakes, feigning purity. It is a story of God, in the fallen, of grace, in the common man, of triumph in the midst of doom and of compassion in the face of corruption and decay.  It is flawless, the best film ever made.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I liked it.  Well written.  It had a good ending too for once.  It is been a while since I have seen a decent sci-fi movie with an original story.
